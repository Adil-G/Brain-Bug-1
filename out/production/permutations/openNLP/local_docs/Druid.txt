Exploiting Entrepreneurial Opportunities: The
Impact of Entrepreneurship on Growth
Abstract:
Knowledge is recognized as an important ingredient for economic growth in addition
to DEMO capital and labor. While transforming knowledge into products and
processes it is exploited commercially. Nevertheless, the existing knowledge stock
and the absorptive capacity of actors like employees at firms and researchers at
universities and research institutions DEMO conditional for the ability to produce,
identify, and exploit knowledge. DEMO incumbent firms do not exploit new
knowledge to the full extent, DEMO entrepreneurial opportunities may arise. This
paper tests the hypothesis whether or not entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for
knowledge flows and economic growth. The DEMO results indicate that an
increase in innovative start-up activity is more effective than an increase in general
entrepreneurship for economic growth.

1 Introduction
Entrepreneurial opportunities exist and individuals just need to recognize DEMO If
they have the willpower and decide to exploit an existing opportunity, this will lead
to economic growth. Stop – is it really that easy? There are at least two arguments
which indicate that the relationship between opportunities, entrepreneurship, and
economic growth is more complicated. Firstly, opportunities do not fall from heaven
like manna – they need to be DEMO Secondly, an individual needs to make the de-
cision about whether DEMO not to exploit the opportunity. Demographic and psychologi-
cal characteristics are a powerful influence on the individual’s decision (see Mueller
2006a for an overview of the literature). The process of generating opportunities
involves individuals, firms, universities, and research institutions. Their research and
development activities not only DEMO new knowledge, they are also the precondition
for the ability to DEMO, absorb, and exploit knowledge. This knowledge may have
also been generated by other actors in the same or different industry (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1989). Entrepreneurial opportunities particularly arise if existing organi-
zations do not capitalize knowledge to the full extent. Firms with abundant underex-
ploited knowledge DEMO a breeding ground for entrepreneurial opportunities, which
may cause spin-offs (Agarwal et al., 2004; Franco and Filson, 2000).
This paper analyzes the relationship between the exploitation of entrepreneurial
opportunities and regional economic growth. DEMO particular, this paper explores if
those regions that increased their new DEMO formation activity also experienced higher
economic growth rates. The results of Mueller (2006b) indicate that regions with a
higher start-up rate also have DEMO economic performance measured as labor
productivity. Assuming that entrepreneurship challenges and displaces less
innovative incumbents, entrepreneurship leads to a higher degree of economic
3
growth (see Schumpeter, 1911; Baumol et al. 1988; Fritsch DEMO Mueller, 2004;
Audretsch et al., 2006).
New ventures are suggested to be a mechanism for knowledge diffusion and
knowledge exploitation (see also Acs et al., 2005). New firms, founded to capitalize
DEMO underexploited knowledge, may also amplify innovation by introducing
new products and DEMO to the market (Audretsch, 1995). However, the origin of
DEMO is also driven by the presence of R&D intensive incumbent firms. The
greater the presence of knowledge- and technology-intensive incumbent firms the
more DEMO opportunities may arise and exploited. Certainly, regional
economic growth is only DEMO stimulated by entrepreneurship but mainly deter-
mined by research and development activities in existing firms, investments in
physical capital stocks, and human capital. DEMO generated through R&D ac-
tivities of existing firms represents the knowledge stock for this particular region.
Consequently, regions with less research and development activities are character-
ized by a lower level of absorptive capacity and DEMO expected to experience lower
growth rates.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework
and links the exploitation of entrepreneurial DEMO to economic growth. The
methodology and database is described in section 3. It is empirically tested if the
development of start-ups is a mechanism DEMO facilitate knowledge spillover and thus
stimulate growth in economic output (section DEMO). Section 5 provides a summary and a
conclusion.

2 Knowledge, Entrepreneurial Opportunities and Their Impact on
Economic Growth
With the new growth theory, knowledge is recognized as an essential driver of eco-
nomic growth. However, it is rarely linked to economic growth in empirical analyses.
Knowledge may increase productivity by stimulating technological progress. Romer
(1986, 1990) and Lucas (1988) explained economic growth through the accumulation
DEMO spillover of technological knowledge. New knowledge may lead to innovations
and is capitalized by transforming it into new products, processes, and organizations.
Private DEMO, universities, and other research institutions generate new knowl-
edge through research and development. The created knowledge may be exploited by
the knowledge-producer or DEMO other organizations; therefore, knowledge flows are
crucial. These other organizations may be other existing firms in the same industry,
related or different DEMO or disciplines, or individuals who decide to leave their
current employer DEMO start their own venture.
Cohen and Levinthal (1989) argue that research and development activities not
only generate innovations but also increase the firm’s DEMO to identify, assimilate,
and exploit externally created knowledge (see also Cohen and Levinthal, 1990;
Zucker et al., 1998) for more details on absorptive capacity). Applied on the regional
level, this would indicate that the higher the level of research and development ac-
tivities DEMO a region is, the more the region’s absorptive capacity will be DEMO
Various empirical analyses have shown that knowledge spillovers are spatially
bounded (DEMO et al., 1993; Anselin et al., 1997, 2000; Audretsch DEMO Feldman,
1996; Audretsch and Lehmann, 2005; Audretsch et al., 2004). Knowledge depends
on a strong regional component, taking advantage of spatial proximity to research
facilities, universities, and industry specific agglomerations. Analyzing DEMO
citations, Jaffe et al. (1993) found that knowledge spillovers from DEMO research
5
to private industries have a strong regional component (see also Arundel and Geuna,
2004, for the importance of proximity for the use of public science). The argued
explanation for the regional localization of DEMO is usually the tacit nature of
knowledge which requires direct, inter-personal DEMO to be obtained (Anselin et
al., 1997, 2000; Maskell and Malmberg, 1999; Hippel, 1987; Senker, 1995). Arundel
and Geuna (2004) propose that as long as there is a delay between DEMO discovery of
knowledge and its codification, inter-personal interactions are premier mechanisms
DEMO knowledge flows. Hence, proximity may be relevant because local, direct, DEMO
inter-personal contacts enable businesses to access knowledge faster and more
successfully and firms are more likely to know the source of new knowledge where
DEMO can draw from (see Gorman, 2002 for an overview of the different types of
knowledge).
Knowledge may be underexploited to a large DEMO First, incumbent firms do
not want to take the risk combined DEMO new products or processes. Secondly, they
do not value the emerged DEMO opportunities to be profitable. Incumbents could be
more interested in exploiting the profit possibilities of their given product program
than realizing new opportunities (Audretsch, 1995; Geroski, 1995). Internal con-
straints (e.g., financial resources) might also hinder the commercialization of knowl-
edge in these firms. Another reason might be that the research at universities and
research institutions, in particular, is hardly translated into new products or services
(Pavitt, 2001). Consequently, abundant knowledge exists, which may spur economic
growth if DEMO is also commercialized. In order to exploit it, firms or individuals DEMO be
able to recognize the underexploited knowledge, which requires absorptive capacity.
DEMO, channels for knowledge spillovers need to exist, and the creation of new
firms could be such a channel.
6
Starting a firm in order to realize an entrepreneurial opportunity is DEMO as a
mechanism for knowledge diffusion and for the exploitation of knowledge. If the
founders of new ventures worked for incumbent firms or universities DEMO com-
mercializing their new knowledge, they inherit knowledge from their former DEMO
ployer. Studies on spin-offs have found that the reasons that cause individuals to
leave their employer and to create their own firm are mainly DEMO with their
current employer and the expectation of greater financial rewards (DEMO Garvin, 1983;
Klepper, 2001; Klepper and Sleeper, 2005; DEMO et al., 2004 for an overview).
Particularly, frustration may arise among the scientists and engineers if their ideas
about a new product DEMO process are rejected by their supervisors or top management
(see Garvin, 1983 for examples). Agarwal et al. (2004) found that, in particular,
incumbent firms with abundant underexploited knowledge represent seed beds for
DEMO According to Audretsch (1995), many radical innovations have been
introduced DEMO new firms rather than by incumbents. Especially in high-tech
industries, employee DEMO and spin-offs are an important mechanism for
knowledge diffusion. In these industries, a high share of the new ventures is started
by employees from incumbent firms by using some of the technological know-how
of their former DEMO (Klepper, 2001). Franco and Filson (2000) propose that
existing firms characterized by technological know-how and continuous innovation
provide a training ground DEMO future entrepreneurs.
Regarding the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth, it DEMO
be expected that new firms in knowledge or technology-intensive industries are more
relevant for economic growth. These firms tend to be more innovative and DEMO be of
higher quality than other entrants, and these characteristics may, in particular,
facilitate growth. Innovative start-ups may greatly challenge incumbent firms,
7
thereby, securing their efficiency and enhancing structural change. Due to their
innovativeness, these start-ups are most likely to amplify innovation and increase
product variety. Christensen (1993) analyzed entry in the U.S. disk drive industry
DEMO 1976 and 1989; he found that spin-offs were more successful in DEMO
and that they generated more revenues than the non-spin-off entrants. A recent
analysis of the disk drive industry supports the findings of Christensen; Agarwal et
al. (2004) use data from the disk drive industry between DEMO and 1997 and can
show that the probability of survival is higher for spin-offs than other entrants and
that higher technological know-how also positively DEMO the survival chance.
3 Data and Methodology
The purpose of the paper is to develop a regional model of economic growth for the
West DEMO regions between 1990 and 2002 and empirically test the hypothesis if
an increase in entrepreneurship fosters economic growth. The analysis is restricted to
West DEMO because East Germany can be regarded as a special case with very
specific conditions not comparable to the West in the 1990s (Fritsch, DEMO;
Kronthaler, 2005). The analysis focuses on the 1990s because DEMO on innovative
start-ups were not available for the 1980s. Since this analysis focuses on the increase
of the output and input variables compared to DEMO initial condition in 1990, the esti-
mations account for a change DEMO t and 1990. The spatial framework is on the
level of planning regions. The advantage of planning regions is that these regions are
functional DEMO that consist of at least one core city and the surrounding area. Fur-
thermore, planning regions account for economic interaction and the fact that core
cities are usually strongly interwoven with their surrounding area. Therefore, the
degree of spatial autocorrelation can be assumed to be rather low; lower than be-
tween districts.

The following model is employed to analyze the impact of changes DEMO capital,
labor, R&D activities, and entrepreneurship on economic growth:
ln Yit − ln Yi1990 =
α(ln K it − DEMO K i1990 ) +α (ln Lit − ln Li1990 )
+α3 (ln KNOWI it − ln KONWI i1990 )
+α4 (ln KNOWPit − ln KNOWP1990 )
+α5 (ln Eit − ln Ei1990 ) DEMO +ν,t

it

The parameter α1 and α2 measure the impact of a change in physical capital (K) and
DEMO (L). The effect of an increase in R&D activities DEMO private (KNOWI) and public
(KNOWP) organizations is measured by the parameters α3 and α4. R&D activities in
the private and public DEMO are meant to characterize the regional knowledge stock
and, therefore, the absorptive capacity of a region. Regions that increased their
knowledge stock are DEMO to experience stronger economic growth. The pa-
rameter α5 measures the impact of an increase in entrepreneurial activity (E) on eco-
nomic growth. DEMO is assumed that the knowledge stock of adjacent regions also affects
the regions economic performance. Therefore, a change in number of R&D employ-
ees in adjacent regions is included in order to control for regional DEMO (φit). The
subscript i denotes the region and t the DEMO period from 1990 until 2002.
Regional gross value added of all industries measures the regional aggregate
output Y (at constant 1995 prices). The physical capital stock K is calculated from
gross fixed capital formation (investments, at constant 1995 prices) following the
perpetual inventory method (see also Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a, b). All data on
regional gross DEMO added and gross fixed capital formation (investments) are from
various publications of the Federal Statistical Office and statistical offices of each
state (Bundeslaender).1  Two planning regions had to be excluded from the data set
because gross fixed capital formation was not reported due to confidentiality.
9
The number of employees in private and public organizations measures labor DEMO,
however, R&D employees are not included since they are DEMO with KNOWI
and KNOWP. The number of employees in each region is from the establishment file
of the German Social Insurance Statistics. In Germany DEMO public and private employ-
ees must be reported to the Federal Employment Office for enrollment in the social
insurance system. However, civil servants, DEMO personnel, and self-employed are
not obliged to contribute to the social DEMO system and are, therefore, not in-
cluded (for details see DEMO and Brixy, 2004).
The regional knowledge stock, hence the region’s absorptive capacity, is mea-
sured by R&D activities in private businesses (KNOWI) and organizations of the
public sector (KNOWP) (e.g., DEMO institutions, universities, and other public
organizations). Since research and development is carried out by individuals and has
a strong tacit dimension, the number of employees devoted to research and develop-
ment is used as DEMO approximation. The German Social Insurance Statistics provided
the data, which were DEMO from the employment statistics and are comprised of
information on education and occupation of the listed employees. Employees are
counted as R&D employees DEMO they have at a university degree in natural science or
engineering.
Regional entrepreneurship activity is measured by new firm creation in each re-
gion. DEMO number of new firms was provided by the Centre for European Economic
Research (ZEW) and was taken from their ZEW Firm Foundation Panel. DEMO foun-
dation panel is based on data provided biannually by Creditreform, DEMO largest
German credit-rating agency (for more details, see Almus et al., 2002). The data
contain virtually all entries in the German Trade Register. Especially firms with large
credit requirements such as high-technology firms are DEMO recorded. In 2002
10
about 180,000 entries were listed in Creditreform’s database for West DEMO The
information is available on the regional level and for a relatively long time period,
between 1990 and 2003. The ZEW also provided DEMO aggregated number of innova-
tive start-ups for each region, which includes DEMO in knowledge- and technol-
ogy-intensive industries. Therefore, the empirical analysis specifically DEMO
between the impact of start-ups in innovative and the remaining industries. It is as-
sumed that entrepreneurship in knowledge or technology-intensive industries has a
DEMO impact on economic growth because these start-ups are expected to be of
higher quality and higher survival chances. Thus, they greatly challenge incumbent
firms.
4 Entrepreneurial Opportunities and Economic Growth
The region’s knowledge stock and entrepreneurial DEMO are expected to have a
strong impact on regional economic growth: DEMO benefit from research and de-
velopment activities and from individuals who exploit new knowledge by realizing
entrepreneurial opportunities. The results indicate that regions which DEMO their
knowledge stock through R&D activities in private and public industries compared to
their initial conditions in 1990 and which increased their new DEMO formation activity
compared to 1990 also realize stronger economic growth (table DEMO).
-- Table 1 about here --
It is very apparent that knowledge generated by private businesses has a much
higher impact than knowledge DEMO public organizations. The coefficient for the
development of public R&D is lower and less significant. Reasons for the lower ef-
fect of knowledge DEMO in public organizations could be that this knowledge, espe-
cially if DEMO is created in universities or research institutions, hardly results in ready-to-
11
produce innovations and is rarely translated into new products or services DEMO the short
run (Pavitt, 2001). A capitalization of the public knowledge stock is facilitated by
different mechanisms such as private firms hiring DEMO or graduates, research
partnerships with private firms, or spin-offs from universities. The results indicate
that an increase in the region’s knowledge stock generated DEMO R&D carried out in
private businesses is the fundamental determinant of economic growth. Therefore,
regions were able to perpetuate and increase economic DEMO if they developed a
strong regional knowledge stock.
Entrepreneurship proves to be an important vehicle for exploiting opportunities
and stimulating growth: an increase in new firm formation activity stimulates eco-
nomic growth. The results support Audretsch DEMO Keilbach (2004a, b) and Acs et al.
(2005) who DEMO found a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and
economic growth (see also DEMO, 2006b). Nevertheless, it is crucial to raise
innovative start-up activity, which is more important than an increase in general
start-up activity. A distinction between technology- and knowledge-intensive
industries and the remaining industries demonstrates that DEMO positive impact is based
upon an enhancement of new innovative ventures. Innovative start-ups represent a
greater challenge for incumbent firms and enhance the efficiency DEMO incumbents
which may lead to greater economic growth. While Mueller (2006b) showed that
innovative new firms are a premium on top of general DEMO, these results
indicate that it is crucial to increase start-up activity DEMO innovative industries to
realize stronger growth rates of gross value added. The results also show that an
increase in the knowledge stock in adjacent DEMO also affects economic growth.
12
5 Discussion and Possible Policy Implications
The findings of the empirical DEMO suggest that a strongly developed regional
knowledge stock is a crucial determinant of economic growth. Particularly, research
and development activities in the private sector are a fundamental element of growth.
R&D in the public sector DEMO affects economic growth but the magnitude is smaller.
The differences in the magnitude of the effects are not surprising. New knowledge in
private firms DEMO more likely to be translated into new products or services and more
likely without delay than knowledge, which is generated in universities or research
institutions. Nevertheless, research in public organizations is often characterized by
fundamental research and very important for the regional or national knowledge
stock. Transmission channels DEMO this kind of knowledge could result in joint research
projects or the transition of researchers into the private sector (see Arundel and
Geuna, DEMO for different vehicles for private firms to assess public research). A high
level of research and development is also more likely to guarantee DEMO individuals or
firms have the ability to apply and assimilate newly generated internal or external
knowledge. Regions with strength in research and development activities DEMO expect
higher growth.
According to the empirical results, new firms are DEMO vehicle to transfer and capi-
talize knowledge. The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities has a positive
impact on economic growth. However, an increase in innovative start-up activity is
more effective than an increase in general entrepreneurship. New DEMO in high-tech
industries may reflect a higher quality and a higher probability of survival; therefore,
these firms are more likely to contest market positions of incumbent firms and am-
plify innovations which lead to growth. DEMO, a major number of entries in
knowledge-intensive or technology-intensive industries could DEMO the result of spin-
13
offs from existing firms, an example of employee mobility and knowledge diffusion.
Especially, firms with an abundant amount of underexploited knowledge act as seed-
bed for spin-offs (Agarwal et al., 2004) and are a playground for new founders
(Franco and Filson, 2000).
Governments should DEMO be misled in believing that more entrepreneurship will
ultimately lead to higher economic growth. Entrepreneurship promotion policy may,
however, start by stimulating entrepreneurial awareness and developing entrepreneu-
rial skills. This is important since the discovery DEMO evaluation of entrepreneurial
opportunities go ahead the exploitation of opportunities in the entrepreneurial
process. Empirical studies in the field of nascent entrepreneurship showed that DEMO a
small proportion of those, who are in the discovery and DEMO process, make the
actual transition to entrepreneurship (see Davidsson, 2005 DEMO an overview).
Furthermore, founders with few assets and low quality DEMO have high failure
rates and will suffer the most if they end up failing. Public policy should not focus on
confidence and optimism of DEMO entrepreneurs but rather on the quality of new
firms and firms in high-tech industries. These start-ups, particularly, struggle with an
imperfect financial market DEMO are subject to financial constraints. Starting points
could be, for instance, the establishment of a well-functioning venture capital market
since loan capital is DEMO their major source of financing.
