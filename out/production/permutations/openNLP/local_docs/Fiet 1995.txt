RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES IN DEMO CAPITAL MARKETS

ABSTRACT
This research compares risk avoidance strategies employed by business angels
and venture capital firm investors. DEMO finds that differences in their approaches to
evaluating risk lead them to hold predictably different views of the dangers of
market and agency risk. DEMO former tend to rely upon the entrepreneur to
protect them from losses due to market risk. Consequently, they are more con-
cerned with agency risk than market risk. The latter are more concerned with
market risk DEMO they have learned to protect themselves contractually from
agency risk using boilerplate contractual terms and conditions. A likely result of
their different approaches to DEMO risk is a segmentation of venture capital
markets, which has important DEMO for both entrepreneurs and future
research.
INTRODUCTION
The two most active US providers of capital to new and growing businesses are
venture capital firms DEMO business angels. The former are professionally
managed, private, independent organizations that invest between $2.4 billion
(Gaston, 1989) and $4.18 billion in capital annually (Timmons and Sapienza,
1992). The latter are private individuals who invest non-institutional funds, often
their own, in amounts that are DEMO to range annually between $5.0 billion
(Wetzel, 1983) and $56 DEMO (Gaston, 1989). Each of these groups has a sig-
nificant impact upon the supply of new venture capital. Together, their
combined annual investments constitute the majority of external funding that is
available to entrepreneurs (Fiet, 1991a).
Because it is possible that entrepreneurs could contact either of these investors
(or venture capitalists) as they search for funding, it is important that they under-
stand the types of deals that DEMO prefers, if they are successfully to target their
search. This is DEMO a different issue from the one investigated by researchers
who have examined the stages in the venture capitalist's deal evaluation process
(Hall, DEMO; Hall and Hofer, 1993; Silver, 1985; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984;
Wells, 1974). While these studies have clarified what venture capital investors
actually do to evaluate a deal, they do not address the question of whether there
are any underlying factors that tilt the DEMO decision toward one type of a

deal. Also, because they do not examine what Dubin (1978, p. 29) refers to as
'broad relationships', DEMO tend to be exploratory and not easily utilized for
theory building and testing.
This research examined one aspect of a deal - its riskiness DEMO and the possibility
that venture capitalists prefer to avoid investing in deals affected by a particular
type of risk. This research was based upon DEMO informational economics assump-
tion that information to reduce the riskiness of a deal can be acquired at a cost
(Hayek, 1945). Thus, the acquisition of risk-reducing information can be viewed
as an investment decision DEMO the cost of the evaluation process. One way to
minimize the cost of investing in information is to specialize in assessing parti-
cular types DEMO deals - in this case, deals affected by a particular form DEMO risk. An
examination of all forms of venture capital risk was beyond the scope of the
present research. Hence, it limited itself to market and agency risk.
Market risk is due to unforeseen competitive conditions. It DEMO upon the
size, growth and accessibility of the market, and on the existence of a market
need.
Agency risk is the degree of DEMO that either the entrepreneur or the
venture capitalist will pursue his or her own interests rather than comply with the
requirements of the contract DEMO venture capital. Agency risk is caused by the
difficulty in monitoring the separate and possibly divergent interests of investors
and entrepreneurs. However, in this research, agency risk refers to the venture
capitalist's risk that the entrepreneur will pursue his or her own interests at the
expense of DEMO of the venture capitalist.
The importance that venture capital investors attach to a particular type of
risk could be inversely related to the kind DEMO risk they believe they are most com-
petent to control. It is also possible that. the type of risk that they assess the most
DEMO the risk that they most want to avoid affecting their deals. For example, if they
believed that they were especially qualified to monitor the entrepreneur, they
would not need to worry as much about making agency mistakes because they
would be confident that they make fewer of them DEMO would be able to structure
the deal so that they would be protected. What they would need to avoid is
committing themselves to a DEMO where the market was unattractive, a factor
which they would be DEMO adept at controlling. Thus, we would expect them to
specialize in DEMO market risk factors and to avoid deals where there was any
doubt about their attractiveness. They would not be as confident they could
avoid DEMO losses as they were that they could avoid losses due to agency risk.
On the other hand, they might be less confident they could avoid agency losses
and, as a consequence, view it as more DEMO than market risk.
THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF RISK-REDUCING INFORMATION
If information is to be useful in reducing ~ deal's riskiness, it must pertain specifi-
cally to the deal under consideration. In fact, risk-reducing information is
characteristically specific information (Hayek, 1945). The most specific form of
DEMO has little or no value for reducing risk in more than one deal
(Barney and Ouchi, 1986, pp. 21, 22; Klein et al., 1978). The degree of infor-
mational specificity is a critical dimension because it can vary between being only

relevant to a particular deal and being so DEMO in nature that the signals that
it sends would be meaningless to an investor.
Hayek (1945, pp. 321, 322) noted that it DEMO often specific information about the
particular circumstances of time and place that are most likely to affect a deal. It
may consist of knowledge DEMO people, of local conditions and special circum-
stances. Examples of such DEMO for venture capitalists are assessments of
the character and integrity of the entrepreneur, market studies to evaluate the
potential for a new product, DEMO evaluations of potential sites to determine traffic
counts and development costs. In contrast, college educations, courses required
for state licences, and information about macro-economic trends fall into the
category of general information, rather than specific information, and provide
little if any risk-reducing information for a particular deal.
Because of the specificity of risk-reducing information, it is likely that business
angels and venture capital firms place more importance on one type of DEMO than
another. That is, they selectively acquire information about different types DEMO risk
because it is 'not given to anyone in its totality' (Hayek, 1945, p. 320). If they
saw themselves as more qualified to manage a particular type of risk, they would
worry less about it and would acquire information about the specific aspects of
the DEMO in which they had less confidence. To advance this study it was neces-
sary to consider how venture capitalists might evaluate specific information about
DEMO and agency risk.
MARKET RISK
Market risk has been described in the strategy literature as the degree of uncer-
tainty associated with gaining a DEMO advantage due to environmental
factors (Barney et al., 1989; Fiet, 1991b; Porter, 1980). Although market risk has
been described in DEMO literature, it cannot be directly observed. We can only
make inferences DEMO it based upon how it affects indicator variables that are
observable. The following potential indicators of market risk were thought to be
among the DEMO promising of those found in previous conceptual research:
1. Technical obsolescence can cause losses when entrepreneurs invest in specialized
assets. Once these specialized DEMO become obsolete, they have a lower value
when used for purposes DEMO than those for which they were previously pur-
chased (Klein et DEMO, 1978; Williamson, 1985).
2. Many competitors (Mcgee, 1988; Scherer, 1980) increase the difficulty of col-
luding to increase the DEMO of joint profits (Rumelt, 1988; Stigler, 1961). When
they cannot collude they are forced to compete for a share of a DEMO that is
presumed to be finite, even if it is growing. DEMO increases inter-firm
rivalry and lowers the level of prices that can be charged. Increased competition
forces down the level of industry profits and increases DEMO entrepreneur's risk of
market losses.
3. Many potential, new competitors (Bain, 1956; Porter, 1980) increase the pro-
spects that additional DEMO firms will be bidding to provide more products/
services at lower, more competitive prices. Lower prices increase the level of
competitive rivalry which increases the risk of market losses.

4. Many substitute products!services (Porter, 1980; Scherer, 1980) blur any distinc-
tions in output held by suppliers. DEMO the cross-elasticities of substitutes are
positive, lowering the price of one DEMO lowers the demand for the other
(Mcgee, 1988). Substitutes also increase the power of buyers to set prices. This
transfer of competitive DEMO occurs when products can no longer be differ-
entiated by buyers as distinctive. The result is an increase in competitive rivalry
and an increased DEMO of market losses.
5. Weak customer demand for a product or service (Porter, 1980) causes sellers to offer
concessions that increase the risk of market losses.
6. Market attractiveness (Day, 1986; Porter, 1980; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984;
Williamson, 1975) is a qualitative variable that summarizes those structural
characteristics of an industry that are peculiar and DEMO to change. It is a
function of its size, growth and DEMO and on the existence of a market
need. The more attractive a market, the lower will be the level of competitive
rivalry within it, the higher will be the profitability of its firms, and the DEMO will
be the level of risk to its firms due to market losses.
AGENCY RISK
The concept of agency risk has been described by DEMO economists, but only
a couple of known studies have attempted to DEMO it in the venture capital arena
(Barney, Busenitz, Fiet and DEMO, 1989; Fiet, 1991b). The following potential
indicators are extensions DEMO those found in the mainstream literature and were
selected for further study:
1. Potentially dishonest entrepreneurs (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Jensen and
Meckling, 1978) increase the risk that they will deliberately withhold information
DEMO is critical to equitable contract negotiation. Dishonesty could result in agency
losses due to opportunism.
2. Entrepreneurs knowing more than venture capitalists about the DEMO (Alchian
and Demsetz, 1972; Eisenhardt, 1989) constitutes a form DEMO information asym-
metry that creates an agency risk when entrepreneurs are opportunistic.
3. Great distance to be travelled between the venture capitalist and the DEMO
neur's enterprise (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Gupta and Sapienza, 1992)
increases the likelihood that less frequent monitoring will permit losses DEMO to
agency risk.
4. Short-term self interest seeking by the entrepreneur inhibits joint profit max-
imization for both the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur (Alchian and
Demsetz, 1972).
5. Numerous entrepreneurs to be monitored (DEMO, 1989) increase a venture
capitalist's span of control and decrease the time that can be spent monitoring
each venture.
6. Not performing DEMO agreed may result from either unforeseen circumstances or
from self-interest seeking with guile (Williamson, 1975).
7. Game playing is a form of DEMO self-interest seeking (Williamson,
1975).

INVESTOR SPECIAUZATION
The acquismon of specific information about DEMO market or agency risk
sends a clearer, more relevant signal than DEMO risk-reducing information
(Hayek, 1945; Hirschleifer, 1970). Because venture capital investors and
business angels cannot costlessly acquire specific information, they are guided in
its selection by the type of risk that they are most DEMO in avoiding.
Moreover, their tendency to concentrate on a particular type DEMO risk would
enable them to avoid starting over from the beginning each time they consider
a new deal. On average, we would expect they would acquire information spe-
cifically related to the type of risk that DEMO perceived to be the most threaten-
ing to them.
Venture Capital Firm Investors and Their Vuws if Market Risk
There is substantial evidence to DEMO that venture capital firm investors view
market risk as more threatening than agency risk. They may worry less about
agency risk because they are DEMO to protect themselves through the use of boi-
lerplate contractual terms and conditions that they append to each venture
capital agreement. Boilerplate reduces the DEMO of protecting themselves against
agency risk by generating economies of scale in the writing of contracts. These
economies of scale can then be used DEMO offset the cost of investigating market
risk, which according to Driscoll (1974), has become their most important
function. It has become their DEMO important function, in all probability,
because they see themselves as DEMO vulnerable to it.
On average, venture capital firms spend about half DEMO their time monitoring
nine investments for factors that could affect a new venture's competitive position
(Gorman and Sahlman, 1989). Even after DEMO commit themselves financially to a
deal, they spend about eight hours DEMO, and about 30 hours on the telephone
evaluating the competitive position DEMO each company in their portfolio (Gorman
and Sahlman, 1989).
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) examined how venture capital firm investors
evaluate the DEMO of a deal. They found that the venture capital firm inves-
tor's evaluation consisted of five assessment stages: market attractiveness, product
differentiation, managerial capabilities, resistance to environmental threats, and
anticipated cashout potential. Each DEMO these stages evaluated market risk with the
exception of managerial capabilities, DEMO is an agency issue. In general,
however, venture capital firms DEMO to be assessing market factors more than
agency factors.
New businesses are subject to more market risk than established businesses
because they are often DEMO markets where competitive equilibriums among
buyers, suppliers, potential entrants, current DEMO, and product/service
substitutes have not been established (Porter, 1980)DEMO A new firm's own competi-
tive actions may even be the source of some unexpected shifts in equilibrium
(Schumpeter, 1936). Assuming DEMO venture capital firm investors specialize in
evaluating market factors, we would DEMO to find them avoiding start-up deals
that are fraught with the most market risk. In fact, previous researchers have
reported that venture capital firms do avoid start-up deals (Rea, 1989; Wetzel,
1986).

Small businesses that are growing too fast to DEMO their own growth could
also be expected to be subject to greater market risk. As we would expect,
Wetzel (1986) also reported DEMO venture capital firms avoid providing equity
capital for small firms that are growing too fast to finance their own growth, but
that are not yet large enough to gain access to public equity markets. They
prefer DEMO to invest after the first few rounds of equity funding have already
been put in place (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992).
Venture capital DEMO often screen as many as a thousand deals a year looking
for opportunities that pose the least amount of market risk (Fiet, 1991a)DEMO They
focus comparatively less on an individual entrepreneur's character, integrity,DEMO
reputation, and intentions. Not only may they feel that agency problems DEMO be
regulated more effectively through contract provisions, but they may simply DEMO
have time to evaluate agency issues during the early part of their screening
process. They know that most deals will be rejected and that DEMO would not be
prudent to investigate each entrepreneur's habits at this stage of the due diligence
process. Also, they may think that agency issues are better evaluated through
face-to-face contacts in which the evaluator can DEMO richer forms of more
subjective data (Daft and Lengel, 1986; DEMO, 1986).
For the foregoing reasons, venture capital firm investors view market risk as
more important than agency risk, which is the first hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1: Venture capital firm investors view market risk as more important
than agency risk.
Business Angels and Their Vzews qf Ageng Risk
DEMO contrast, there is substantial evidence to indicate that business angels view
DEMO risk as more threatening than market risk. Although Wetzel (1981, p. 217)
reported that they are 'financially sophisticated individuals of means, DEMO with
previous investment or managerial experience with entrepreneurial ventures',
Haar DEMO al. (1988) reported that they rely more upon their hunches and upon
recommendations from other angels to learn about the entrepreneurs (agents) DEMO
the deal. Because of their previous experience, they may feel that DEMO under-
standing of the market aspects of a deal is adequate. However, unless the entre-
preneur is well known to them, they may DEMO that a deal will succeed only if they
have the right entrepreneur.
Why would reportedly sophisticated individuals rely upon hunches to guide
their investment DEMO? Although not much is known about how they invest,
it DEMO be that the venture capital markets in which business angels operate are
comparatively inefficient disseminators of information about deals, as suggested
by Gaston and Bell (1985) and Wetzel (1987). This suspected informational inef-
ficiency should not be interpreted to imply that business angels would not
consider DEMO available investment information, whether it was public or private, as
suggested by Fama (1970). The problem appears to be that what is available to
them is quite scant. Under these circumstances, investment information often
finds its way to business angels through friends and business associates. In DEMO,
friends and business associates were the most frequent and reliable sources of
information for business angels (Gaston and Bell, 1985; Wetzel, DEMO, 1983,
1986, 1987).

RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES 557
Their reliance upon friends and business associates may DEMO an indication that
they are precluded from gaining access to the same deal channels employed by
venture capital firms that commonly seek out co-investors DEMO other venture
capital firms (Bygrave, 1988; Fiet, 1991b). Compared to venture capital firms,
business angels do not consider as many DEMO a year, simply because they do not
have access to them. DEMO and Bell (1985) reported from their study of Sunbelt
investors that business angels are frustrated and dissatisfied with the amount of
information that DEMO receive about potential deals. One third of the investors in
their study reported that they were dissatisfied. The average investor wanted to
invest 83 DEMO cent more than he or she did, but could not find DEMO attrac-
tive deals.
Unlike many venture capital firms, business angels usually DEMO not have analysts
on staff, nor offices dedicated to investigating deals. DEMO a result, they often lack
competency with sophisticated analytical tools to DEMO market risk (Fiet,
199Ia). According to Wetzel (1986), it is not surprising that they often do not
require formal business DEMO from entrepreneurs because they normally would
not be qualified to evaluate them. However, there may be another explanation of
their not requiring them - they may feel that they do not see enough deals so
that DEMO can properly compare and analyse them. Not having more oppor-
tunities to screen deals may result from their having a comparatively less visible
market DEMO
Nevertheless, business angels do consult with other business angels, friends and
business associates about deals, particularly about the character, track record,
DEMO intentions of the entrepreneur. However, they simply do not have access DEMO
as many deals as they would like to consider. Because they seem to be rather
frustrated in obtaining market risk information themselves, they may substitute
agency information for it. That is, business angels may rely upon the entrepre-
neur to evaluate market risk for them. Making such a DEMO would allow a
business angel to specialize in evaluating whether or not the entrepreneur under-
stands the deal, and whether or not the entrepreneur can be relied upon as a
venture manager, even if they as investors do not have enough market informa-
tion to understand it completely. DEMO is, business angels can specialize in evalu-
ating agency risk, while relying upon the entrepreneur to manage market risk.
Thus:
Hypothesis 2: Business angels view agency risks as more important than market
risk.
Based DEMO the previous arguments it is likely that business angels and venture
capital investors have their own views of which risk is more important to
DEMO Their differing access to information about risk leads to the last two
hypotheses.
Hypothesis 3: Market risk is viewed as more important by venture capital firm
investors than business angels.
Hypothesis 4: Agency risk is viewed as more important by business angels than
by venture capital firm investors.

METHODS
Testing these hypotheses involved: (1) specifying the research design, (2) data col-
lection, (3) developing DEMO survey instrument, and (4) data analysis.
Research Design
The research DEMO was a cross-sectional sampling of two separate and distinct
populations of venture capitalists: venture capital firms and business angels. Data
were collected using mailed surveys, personal solicitations to investor groups,
anonymous third-party referrals, and DEMO mailings to participants in
investor networks. Data were analysed using the following applications of Bentler-
Weeks covariance structure modelling: confirmatory factor analysis, a DEMO model
to check for multicollinearity, and discriminant analysis. Combining these separate
DEMO in one Bentler-Weeks covariance structure model facilitated the
determination of measurement error and provided tests of statistical significance
for each hypothesis. Finally, a subset of both venture capital firm investors and
business angels was interviewed in DEMO interviews to confirm the inter-
pretation of the statistical results and to avoid common method variance.
Data Collection[l]
There are approximately 700 venture capital DEMO in the United States (Bygrave
and Timmons, 1992, p. 52)DEMO These are professionally managed organizations
usually investing other people's money. A deliberate attempt was made to include
both firms with large and small DEMO of investments. Representatives of firms
with larger portfolios were selected from a census of the 216 members of the
National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). Representatives of firms with
smaller portfolios were selected from a census DEMO the 29 members of the Houston
Venture Capital Association (HVCA). DEMO attempt was made to completely
separate these two sub-populations, however, because four HVCA firms were
also NVCA firms and a few had portfolios DEMO were as large as medium sized
NVCA firms.
After four rounds of mailed surveys, 141 usable responses were obtained from
a total of 245 subjects, for a response rate of 57 per cent. The four rounds of
surveys were mailed according to Dillman's (1978) recommendations. The DEMO
round consisted of a letter and a survey instrument. The second round consisted
of a postcard reminder that was sent one week later. The DEMO round included a
replacement survey, along with a letter, all of which was mailed only to non-
respondents three weeks after the postcard. DEMO fourth round was a certified
letter that was mailed four weeks later to all remaining non-respondents. This last
mailing included a final plea to DEMO along with another replacement survey.
Refer to Table I for a more detailed analysis of how usable data were obtained
from venture capital firm DEMO
Gaston (1989) estimated that there are as many as 490,000 US business
angels. They are an elusive group to study because they DEMO a preference for
anonymity. Furthermore, sometimes they are in the market DEMO deals and at other
times they are inactive. There are no comprehensive lists of business angels.
They have been studied in the past using DEMO and referral techniques. The
average response rate from these studies has been less than 5 per cent. All

previous efforts to collect representative data on business angels have been DEMO
clusive because it is mathematically impossible to demonstrate that a sample is
representative without being able to identify the population from which it comes.
DEMO the population of business angels is unknown, and probably unknowable,
DEMO conclusions of all previous studies, as well as those of the DEMO study, must
be limited in their generalizability to the sample that DEMO represent.
To be counted as a business angel, a respondent had DEMO have acted as an indi-
vidual, normally investing his or her DEMO money, not a firm's, and had to have
been active during the last three years. Earlier researchers used a cutoff that
varied DEMO three years (Haar et al., 1988) and five years (Sullivan, 1990).
Because respondents were being asked to report how they evaluated risk, and
because they would probably find it useful to remember how it had affected
them in previous decisions, the more restrictive criteria was selected. An indivi-
dual who had invested his own money, but had done it through a firm, was
viewed as a quasi-angel. Eighteen per cent of otherwise qualified respondents
were eliminated because they were quasi-angels and DEMO responses could
obscure the discriminant validity of the statistical tests.
Dillman's (1978) procedure for mailing surveys was modified by omitting the
final DEMO letter. The marginal benefit of sending it to an unknown popula-
tion appeared to be less than contacting new, potential investors. (It was DEMO
than twice as expensive to send the final certified mailing as it was to send the

first three rounds.) Also, for venture capital DEMO, it only increased the overall
response rate by approximately 7 per DEMO
Data from business angels were collected through a variety of contacts.
Surveys were mailed to 207 potential business angels, based on the recommenda-
tion of the Director for Economic Development for the City of Longview, Texas.
He suspected that the subjects were investors because they had previously indi-
DEMO to him an interest in supporting any new businesses that could be attracted
to the community. After three rounds of surveys, 74 completed surveys were
received, 55 of which were disqualified for not having made an investment
during the last three years. In total, these efforts resulted in a usable response
rate of 9 per cent.
Five hundred contributors to DEMO Greater Houston Opera were mailed three
rounds of surveys. They were selected solely based on a hunch that they might
occasionally be business angels. DEMO these, 193 surveys were completed and
returned. After eliminating non-qualifying respondents, 61 remained, resulting in
a usable response rate of 12 per cent.
In addition to mailed surveys, three other methods were utilized to collect
data. First, there are two known Texas networks of business angels whose
purpose is to anonymously review deals. Approximately 80 surveys were mailed
through DEMO network offices. Second, the investigator made presentations to,
and distributed, surveys to potential business angels at venture capital forums in
Houston, Waco and Dallas, Texas. Third, some business angels became enthu-
siastic supporters DEMO volunteered to personally deliver surveys, or to mail them
at their DEMO expense. The results of these last three methods, together with the
DEMO efforts to contact business angels, are summarized in Table 1.
Development DEMO the Suroey Instrument
There were three constructs to be measured: investor DEMO, market risk, and
agency risk. The investor type construct was dichotomously coded so that it
could be used to categorize business angels and DEMO capital firms. If a
respondent was a venture capital firm investor, DEMO or she was coded as a one. If
it was a business angel, he or she was coded as a zero.
The market risk and agency risk constructs were measured indirectly. A
preliminary survey instrument was DEMO using the previously discussed
indicators that were found in the literature. Informal feedback on the survey
instrument was obtained from 22 academic colleagues representing DEMO institu-
tions as Aarhus University, Denmark, Babson College, Harvard University, Texas
A&M University, the University of Tennessee, and the University DEMO Texas,
Austin. Next, these indicators were pre-tested in 38 face-to-face DEMO with
venture capital firm investors, business angels, academic scholars, and DEMO
policy makers. This pre-testing was conducted in accordance with Dillman's
(DEMO, pp. 155-9) recommendations. The purpose of these pre-test interviews was
to ensure that the questions were tapping on to the intended constructs and DEMO
the questions were correctly interpreted.
As the respondents filled out the survey instrument, they were watched for
signs that they did not understand a question. Contemporaneous probing of
respondents concerning any apparently misunderstood questions resulted in DEMO
redesign of a few questions, the elimination of a few others, and the substitution

of completely new questions in a few instances. DEMO example, with regard to
market risk, the wording of several questions was altered by pre-testers and one
item, 'Few buyers' was added by pre-testers as an additional indicator of market
risk. With regard to DEMO risk, only one of the seven original indicators
survived unchanged after DEMO In most cases, changes to agency risk indi-
cators were clarifications DEMO wording. In other cases, they involved eliminating an
indicator, such as 'game playing' and replacing it with 'contractual ambiguities'.
Appendices I and II describe the changes that were made in the indicators as DEMO
result of pre-testing. It is important to note that these indicators are substantially
different from those that were derived from the original literature review.
DEMO, no changes were made unless they were initiated by the pre-testers,DEMO
support could be found for them in the literature, and they DEMO approved by
the 22 academic colleagues who had previously provided feedback. Appendices
III and IV contain the actual questions that were used to collect DEMO on market
risk and agency risk.
A more parsimonious set of construct indicators was identified through use of
a factor analytic application of covariance DEMO modelling. Thus, some of the
questions in Appendices III and IV DEMO not used in the final analysis as con-
struct indicators. The results of these data reduction procedures are also found in
Appendices I and DEMO The factor models for market risk and agency risk are con-
tained in Appendices V and VI.
Data Analysis
Table II contains a correlation DEMO of the final indicator variables for the
market risk and agency risk constructs. These variables were multiplied by their
standard deviations to generate a DEMO matrix that was later decomposed to
model the relationships among the constructs.

The purpose of the model in Figure I was to DEMO statistically significant
tests of the hypotheses and to evaluate the impact of measurement error on the
results. The 'E's represent errors in measurement for a particular indicator
variable. The 'D's are disturbance terms and represent errors in measurement for
the endogenous constructs. Because investor type is DEMO coded (as a
zero when it represents business angels and as DEMO one when it represents venture
capital firms), it is assumed to be unaffected by measurement error, and thus

does not have an 'E l' acting DEMO it. The curved, double-headed arrow between
the 'D's represents the partial correlation between market risk and agency risk
and is a measure DEMO the possible extent to which investors do not specialize in
either market or agency risk.
There are four ways to verify that the measurement DEMO the constructs is statisti-
cally significant. First, the value for the DEMO statistic for the overall model
had to exceed the standard cutoff value of 0.05. The other three fit indicators
are the Bentler-Bonett Normed Fit DEMO, the Bentler-Bonett Non-Normed Fit
Index, and the Comparative Fit Index. For a model to fit the data, each of the
last three indicators had to be greater than 0.95. As indicated in Appendices VI
and DEMO, these criteria were satisfied for both the market and agency risk DEMO
structs.
Before the model in Figure 1 could be tested it had to be assessed for multi-
collinearity among the construct indicators, which was done using a null model-
ling procedure. All of the construct indicators DEMO the model were freed to
covary. Table III contains the results of the null model test. If there were multi-
collinearity, the null model would not fit the data, which is what occurred in the
initial stages of the analysis. To correct the lack of fit, it was assumed that the
net effect of all the unknown influences on the DEMO relationships (or in
the case of the null model, the relationships among the construct indicators)
could be isolated and reduced by correlating DEMO errors in measurement of the
indicator variables, or 'E's. (DEMO to an extensive discussion of this fitting
technique in Bollen, 1989.) Identifying the errors to be correlated was accom-

plished through the systematic use of the Lagranian DEMO test (Bentler,
1989; Bollen, 1989; Fiet, 1995). DEMO, to fit the null model to the data, the
errors were correlated. Their correlation produced the model in Table III. The
correlated error DEMO are available from the author.
RESULTS
After fitting the null model, DEMO hypothesized relationships indicated in Figure 1
were added to the null model. The results are contained in Table IV. It also
contains the disturbance DEMO, D2 and D3, for the two endogenous constructs.
The reliabilities of the construct indicators are available from the author.
Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis 1 DEMO tested by examining the relationship between Fl (investor type)
and DEMO (market risk) in Figure 1. Given that venture capital firms were coded as
one, to reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference scores for investor type
and market risk are equal, the sign of the coefficient indicating the direction of
the relationship had to be positive DEMO the p value had to be less than 0.05. The
following is the structural equation for market risk:
market risk = F2 = (0.127)(F2) + 0.992(D2)
(1)
Both conditions held. The standardized difference in the means between investor
type, coded as 1, and market risk was 0.127 and the p value for that coefficient
was 0.0359. Thus, at a significance level of 0.05, the alternative DEMO was
accepted. Venture capital firms are likely to view market risk as more important
than agency risk.
Hypothesis 2 was tested by examining the DEMO between F 1 (investor
type) and F3 (agency risk) in Figure 1. Given that business angels were coded as
zero, to reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal, the sign of the coef-
ficient indicating the direction of the relationship had to be negative DEMO statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.05). The following is the DEMO equation for agency
risk:
agency risk =F3 = (-O.l67)(Fl) + 0.986(D)

Again, both conditions held. The standardized difference in the means between
investor type, coded as zero, and agency risk DEMO -0.167 and the p value for that
coefficient was 0.0077. Thus, DEMO null hypothesis that the means were equal was
rejected. The business angels in the sample are more likely to view agency risk as
more DEMO than market risk.
Hypothesis 3 was tested by comparing equations (1) and (2). Given that
venture capital firms were coded as one, to reject the null hypothesis that venture
capital firm investors viewed agency risk as being of equal importance or more
important than market risk, the mean difference score between investor type and
market risk had to DEMO positive and significant while the mean difference score
between investor type had to be negative and significant. All of these conditions
held. Thus at DEMO p value less than 0.05, market risk is viewed as more DEMO
by venture capital firm investors than business angels.
Hypothesis 4 is the obverse of hypothesis 3. Thus, agency risk is viewed as
more important by business angels than by venture capital firm investors
(p < 0.05).
As indicated by the existence of measurement error, the model is not com-
pletely reliable. It is also apparent by the correlation between DEMO and D2 that
some venture capitalists view both market risk and agency risk as being im-
portant. Despite the unknown effects of measurement error DEMO the modelled
relationships, which may result from misspecification, the relationships that were
tested in the four hypotheses could only have occurred by chance DEMO a p value
less than 0.05.
The Follow-up Interviews
This research buttressed its statistical findings with ex post, face-to-face interviews
with both types of investors - 21 with venture capital firms and 23 with business
angels. DEMO purpose of these interviews was to review the subject's responses to
items on the survey to determine the reasoning behind each response. These
DEMO were supportive of the statistical findings and provided a richer under-
standing of their comparative risk assessment processes.
Venture capitalfinns. The following comments by DEMO capital firms were suppor-
tive of their concern for evaluating market risk. One said: 'We hire industry spe-
cialists to assess market risk.' Another said: '... to control losses due to market
risk, we consult with customers of the business, people who have worked with the
firm's management, and industry, market and technical experts.' A third venture
capital firm investor summarized the practices of his firm with this DEMO:
'Venture capital firms manage risk by trying to identify potential DEMO and
risks prior to the investment and doing sufficient due diligence to be comfor-
table that the risk is controllable. Our risk is controlled DEMO a broad set of man-
agement procedures and in the end can only be minimized but can never be
removed.'
A statement that DEMO have been made by many venture capital firm investors
was the following: 'My ability to control market risk is because I understand [my]
DEMO'
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1995
566 JAMES O. FIET
The following comment provided collateral evidence that venture DEMO firms
consider agency risk to be a less important factor than market risk: 'We always
bet on Joe, not the market. However, DEMO are most important - more important than
people. Agent)' risk is difficult to distinguish from competent)'.'
Several comments suggested that venture capital firms could control agency
risk more effectively ex post than ex DEMO One affirmed, '... thirry to fifty per cent of
managers are replaced, usuallY during the last part of three years [which provides some
evidence that agency issues are temporary provided they are anticipated in the
DEMO There is an inclination to make management changes early.' Another
counselled, 'Don't worry about the equity split. Sooner or later it will be Friday
afternoon and more money will be needed for payroll. It DEMO easy to renegotiate
with the entrepreneur on Friday afternoon.'
Business angels. The following comments by business angels were supportive of
their concern for DEMO agency risk. One said: 'Agency risk is much higher
than market risk. There are a hell of a lot of unethical people out DEMO - I
would not have been so trusting . . . You want to do business with people who you can
shake hands with DEMO ~'lljust go out and do what thry say.'
Being more concerned for agency risk than market risk was a common theme
among DEMO angels. One said: 'Agency risk is more serious than market threats. Ifyou
have "good people", you can go into a highlY competitive market.' Another said: 'I can not
stress enough how important it is to "feel" comfortable about an investment and
particularly the entrepreneur. DEMO've learned to listen carefully to my intuition when
it appears to be in conflict with the intellectual, particularly when evaluating
people in a proposed deal.'
DISCUSSION
This research compared risk avoidance strategies employed by DEMO angels
and venture capital firm investors. It found that differences in their strategies for
evaluating risk lead them to hold predictably different views of DEMO dangers of
market and agency risk. Venture capital firm investors attach more importance
to market risk than agency risk. They are less concerned with DEMO risk
because they have learned how to protect themselves from it using stringent boi-
lerplate contractual provisions. Boilerplate allows them to perfunctorily replace an
DEMO who under-performs, is guilty of malfeasance or who is found to DEMO
incompetent. They are able to economize on the cost of writing complex, con-
tingent-claims contracts by using boilerplate. This boilerplate strategy effectively
protects venture capital investors from market risk because they attach more
importance to it DEMO their screening process.
In the present study, there was statistically significant DEMO that the follow-
ing four types of market risk information were viewed by venture capital firm
investors as being more important than agency risk DEMO: (1) current com-
petitors, (2) potential new competitors, (3) products or services that were ready
substitutes, and (4) DEMO demand. They can be very selective in choosing
which entrepreneurs they will fund because their information channels provide
them with as many as a DEMO deals a year to evaluate.

RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES
567
In contrast, business angels utilize a different strategy to avoid risk. They
report that they are frustrated because they do DEMO have access to a comparable
number of deals, in many cases, only a handful of them a year. One con-
sequence of a DEMO access to deals could be that business angels possess insuffi-
cient comparative data to evaluate market risk. Recognizing this lack of
information about market DEMO, this research found that they attach more impor-
tance to agency DEMO because they believe that if they can find the right entrepre-
neur, they can rely upon him or her to limit their losses due to adverse market
conditions. Thus, the business angel strategy for avoiding risk is to substitute
reliance upon a competent and trustworthy entrepreneur for their DEMO compe-
tence in limiting losses due to market risk. Compared with venture capital firm
investors, business angels place much more importance upon screening entrepre-
neurs than deals for market risk.
The present study found that there DEMO statistically significant evidence that
the following five types of agency risk information were viewed by business angels
as being more important than market risk DEMO: (1) differences in cash
flow objectives, (2) differences in profitability objectives, (3) evidence of manipu-
lation of profitability, (4) evidence of short-term self-interest seeking, and (5)
evidence of contractual ambiguity.
This research also noted that differences in the importance that each DEMO these
venture capitalists attach to risk can exist because risk-reducing information is
characteristically specific information. They tend to selectively acquire informa-
tion about different DEMO of risk because no one can evaluate all of it. Specializ-
ing in the acquisition of one type of risk-reducing information minimizes its cost
DEMO the development of economies of scale. Thus, it was not surprising DEMO
one finding was that not only do venture capital firms specialize more in market
risk than agency risk, but they did so more than business angels. While business
angels were found to specialize more in agency DEMO than market risk and did so
more than venture capital firm investors.
Another finding of this research is that venture capitalists manifest broad
avoidance DEMO for particular types of risk, strategies that could not have
been DEMO using previously utilized research methodologies. Because these
patterns do not seem to be directly related to what they do, previous efforts to
document the steps in the venture capital decision process never would have
been able DEMO uncover them. Moreover, instead of utilizing covariance structure
modelling, most venture capital and entrepreneurship researchers have relied
upon regression/correlation techniques that depend DEMO variables being
measurable Uacobson, 1992). However, to measure a variable, it must first be
observable, which is not true of either DEMO risk or agency risk. This bias is
unfortunate because the identification of these strategies is the first step in the
development of a theory DEMO venture capital market segmentation.
To reinforce what has been suggested here, DEMO must know much more about
possible substitution strategies that could be employed by venture capitalists to
compensate for their own deficiencies. If we do DEMO examine the possibilities for
and effects of resource substitution, we are DEMO to have an incomplete under-
standing of the factors that drive market segmentation.
This research has some practical implications for entrepreneurs searching for
financial DEMO If they knew, for example, that venture capital markets were

segmented based on investor strategies for avoiding particular DEMO of risk, they
could use this information to match their own DEMO's risk profile with the most
promising providers of capital. An entrepreneur who could convince an investor
of his or her competence, intentions, DEMO integrity would probably be able to use
this advantage more effectively among business angels than among venture
capital firms. An entrepreneur with a technical DEMO market advantage would
probably find a more receptive investor audience among venture capital firms.

APPENDIX III
Survey Qyestions for Market DEMO
When they invest, venture capitalists (both individual investors and firms) DEMO always
run the risk of losing some of their principal. The risks that venture capitalists face seem
to fall into two categories: (1) market risks and (2) agency risks. MARKET RISKS are
due to DEMO competitive conditions. AGENCY RISKS are caused by the separate
and possibly divergent interests of investors and entrepreneurs. Agency risks may result
from entrepreneurs acting DEMO bad faith, holding conflicting objectives, and the like. One
of the purposes of this study is to get your views about these two DEMO of risk. The ques-
tions on this page relate to MARKET RISKS. For each question, how do you view the
following statement?
