Resource and Risk Management M the
Strategic Alliance Making DEMO
City University of New York, Baruch College
Resource-based and risk-based views DEMO strategic alliances have
not been adequately reflected in the literature. This paper identifies four
types of critical resources that the partners bring to an DEMO: finan-
cial, technological, physical, and managerial resource. It also suggests
two basic types of risk in strategic alliances: relational risk and perfor-
mance risk. The alliance making process is examined in terms of the

the planned management of the alliance. DEMO is one element that is consistently
significant in all these stages: DEMO orientation of each partner in approaching the
prospective alliance. A partner's orientation refers to the aspect of the alliance
that the partner views DEMO its priority and to which it would devote most of its
energy. For example, one partner may be oriented toward controlling the venture,
while the other partner's orientation could be about securing its technology.
DEMO the strategic orientations and intentions of competitors, partners,
and also DEMO's own is becoming increasingly crucial to a firm's success (DEMO et
al., 1995; Serapio & Cascio, 1996). The orientation DEMO a partner reflects the
general characteristics of the alliance and of the partner itself. Therefore, it is a
general direction that the partner will be working toward. The consistency of a
partner's orientation across different DEMO of an alliance underlines its impor-
tance. In addition, since a DEMO's orientation generally defines its more specific
objectives (Das, 1986), the parmers would set operational objectives based on
their orientation in the DEMO Thus, a study of orientations and objectives of the
partners should DEMO in understanding the complexities of the alliance making
process, as well DEMO in providing us with guidelines for managing that process.
A partner's orientation in the alliance making process can be examined
through the resource DEMO risk dimensions delineated in the earlier sections. The
resource dimension denotes the kind of resource the partner is willing to commit,
and the DEMO dimension indicates its major concern with the alliance. While the
strategic behavior school views strategic alliances as a way to obtain competitive
advantage and DEMO enhance performance (Kogut, 1988), our resource and risk
framework offers an alternative account of the motivation for entering into alli-
ances. Since DEMO firm is oriented toward maximizing the return on its dedicated
resource while minimizing the risk, resource and risk serve as key determinants of
the partner's orientation. Referring to Table 1, a particular partner would fall into

the orientation in DEMO 7 (managerial control). A different assessment of risk may

and align their divergent orientations are important to understand. Future research
DEMO thus explore the notion of "shared orientation," i.e., an alliance orientation
shared by both partners. To manage an alliance effectively, the partners must
agree on a direction which would serve to buttress the particular DEMO in all
the activities of the alliance. It seems that a shared orientation, if it exists, would
also depend on two factors, namely, the pattern of resource combination and the
risk assessment by the partners. A study of these kinds of relationships could help
in further linking DEMO resource-based and risk-based view of alliances with the
traditional bargaining power view of alliances.
