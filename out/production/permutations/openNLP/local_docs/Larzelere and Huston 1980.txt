The Dyadic Trust Scale:
Toward Understanding Interpersonal Trust
in Close Relationships*

Interpersonal trust is an aspect of close relationships which has been DEMO
ignored in social scientific research despite its importance as perceived by intimate
partners and several family theorists. This article describes the development, valida-
tion, and correlates of the Dyadic Trust Scale, a tool designed for DEMO research. It is
unidimensional, reliable, relatively free from response biases, DEMO purposely
designed to be consistent with conceptualizations of trust from various perspectives.
Dyadic trust proved to be associated with love and with intimacy of DEMO,
especially fbr longer married partners. It varied by level of commitment, being lowest
for ex-partners and highest for those engaged and living together, for newlyweds,
and for those married over 20 years. Partners reciprocated trust more than either
love or depth of self-disclosure. Future research could DEMO relate dyadic trust to
such issues as personal growth in relationships, DEMO interpersonal conflict, and
developing close relationships subsequent to separation or divorce.
DEMO of human relations suggest that
"trust" is an integral feature of such relation-
ships. Trust is most generally defined as a
belief by DEMO person in the integrity of another
individual. Stinnett and Walters (1977) sug-
gest that trust increases security in a relation-
ship, reduces inhibitions and defensiveness,
and frees people to share feelings and
dreams. Trust DEMO seen by O'Neill and O'Neill
(1972) as a prerequisite for marital partners

to open their marriage to their full potential
for personal and interpersonal growth. These
and related postulates (Dion and Dion, 1976;
Driscoll et al., 1972; Lederer and Jackson,
1968; Olthuis, 1975) which use the concept of
trust as an interpretive concept fail ade-
quately to establish what they mean by DEMO
and to provide satisfactory measures of the
phenomenon. The present paper seeks to
remedy these deficiencies by operationalizing
the concept of trust, demonstrating its mea-
surement, and reporting on the relationship
between our construct and related aspects of
close human relationships. Thereafter, we
suggest a number of research questions and
approaches which might employ our method
of measuring trust to DEMO deeper insight into
relationships.
Two attributions seem particularly perti-
nent aspects of interpersonal trust as concep-
tualized in the literature. The first is an
DEMO OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY
595
attribution concerning the partner's benevo-
lence (Altman and Taylor, 1973; Deutsch,
1962; Ellison and Firestone, 1974; Giffin,
1967; DEMO and Youniss, 1973; Pearce, 1974;
Phillips and Metzger, 1976; Wrightsman,
1964). Is a partner genuinely interested in the
other's welfare or only in his/her own wel-
fare? In other words, is the partner motivated
individualistically (i.e., to seek his/her own
gain) or is he/she motivated cooperatively
(I.e., to seek joint maximum gain)? These
motivations may often lead to the same DEMO
personal behavior, but an attribution of a
partner's major motivation DEMO influence a
prediction about some future time when the
two motivations might lead to different inter-
personal behaviors. The second form of attri-
bution DEMO honesty (Altman and Taylor,
1973; Giffin, 1967; Lederer and Jackson,
1968; Lorr, 1975; Pearce, 1974; Rotter, 1971;DEMO
Schlenker et al., 1973; and Wrightsman,
1964). To what extent can I believe my part-
ner when he tells me about DEMO future inten-
tions? If a graduate student husband, for
example, DEMO to pay for his wife's educa-
tion after he graduates, DEMO much does his
wife believe him?
The attributions that one's partner is both
benevolent and honest or sincere are impor-
tant for DEMO the future potential of a
relationship. The more that the target person
is seen as benevolent and honest toward the
perceiver, the more likely the perceiver will be
to predict a favorable future for the relation-
DEMO Attributed benevolence allows a person
to feel comfortable despite becoming more
intimate and therefore potentially more
vulnerable in the relationship. Attributed
honesty appears to DEMO a prerequisite for tak-
ing the partner's word at face value as indica-
tive of genuine future intentions. While
benevolence and honesty are DEMO
distinct, they may turn out to be so inter-
twined in DEMO relationships, espe-
cially intimate ones, that they are operation-
ally inseparable. If a partner's honesty is
questioned this may lead to doubting DEMO
benevolence, and vice versa.
Thus, the conceptualization of trust in the
literature leads to the following definition:
trust exists to the extent DEMO a person believes
another person (or persons) to be benevolent
and honest. Dyadic tyrust can be distin-
guished from generalized trust in that DEMO
former refers specifically to the benevolence
and honesty of a significant other toward the
individual making the judgment. Generalized
trust, in contrast, refers DEMO a person's belief
about the character of people in the aggregate
(Rotter, 1967, 1971; Wrightsman, 1964).
Dyadic trust was expected to be associated
with characteristics of relationship intimacy
such as love, self-disclosure, and commit-
ment. Since trust is, in part, an attribution of
benevolence directed toward the attributor,
the partner's benevolence should influence
DEMO first person's trust. Benevolence seems
also to be an important component of love.
Four of 12 items on Rubin's (1970) Love DEMO
apparently tap this component of love (e.g.,
"I would do almost anything for [my
partner]"). Therefore, it was predicted that
DEMO in one's partner would be correlated
with that partner's love.
As intimate partners get to know one
another better, their attributions should be-
come more accurate with time. Dion and
Dion (1976) found DEMO couple love and trust
scores were more highly correlated for marital
than for premarital partners, but individual
love and trust scores (i. e., one's own love and
trust) did not become more correlated with
time. One possible explanation for this is that
it is the partner'DEMO love rather than one's own
love that becomes more highly related to
one's own trust for that partner over time.
Such an DEMO between one's own trust
and the partner's love would influence the
relationship between the couple love and trust
scores but not the DEMO between the
individual love and trust scores. Thus, it was
predicted DEMO one's own trust and the part-
ner's love would be more highly correlated for
married couples than for dating couples.
Altman and DEMO (1973) have stated that
trust is necessary for self-disclosure in on-
going relationships. They suggest that the
reciprocity of disclosure may be based DEMO
reciprocity of trust in such relationships.
While this makes sense intuitively, DEMO remains
unsupported by empirical data. Several
studies have found no correlation between
trust and self-disclosure (MacDonald et al.,
1972; McAllister and Kiesler, 1975; Vondra-
cek and Marshall, 1971), but none of these
DEMO used measures of both trust and dis-
closure with respect to a particular other per-
son. In this study, it was predicted that self-
disclosure to an intimate partner would corre-
late positively with dyadic trust.

Finally, dyadic trust would seem to be a
prerequisite for commitment, DEMO higher
levels of trust necessary for higher levels of
commitment. Thus, DEMO, on the
average, should have higher trust than en-
gaged or cohabiting partners, who, in turn,
should have higher trust than DEMO dat-
ing partners. The latter, then, should have
more trust than casually dating partners.
Trust in ex-partners (whether ex-dating or ex-
married) DEMO tend to be less than trust
levels in currently close relationships. Longer
married couples should have average trust
levels below the newlywed ceiling level DEMO
above the divorced floor level. Since dyadic
trust has little room to increase above the ex-
pected high level for newlyweds, those who do
decrease in trust during marriage, even
though they are a minority, DEMO bring the
average level of trust below the newlywed
level.
Associations among self-report scales are
often inflated by a common component of a
social DEMO response bias (Edwards,
1957). To check whether this was DEMO confound-
ing factor, the discriminant validity of the
Dyadic Trust Scale DEMO ascertained by exam-
ining whether dyadic trust was more closely
associated with the indicators of interper-
sonal intimacy than was social desirability.
A similar DEMO involves whether dyadic
trust improves on available measures of
generalized trust (DEMO, Rotter, 1967; Wrights-
man, 1964). If generalized trust is also
associated with love, self-disclosure, and rela-
tionship status, then the predicted relation-
ships for construct validity might be found
simply because of DEMO overlap between dyadic
trust and generalized trust. Therefore, associ-
ations of DEMO with intimacy were also exam-
ined after substituting each generalized trust
measure for the dyadic trust score. As before,
discriminant validity was demonstrated DEMO the
extent that dyadic trust was more strongly
related to the variables of interest than was
generalized trust.
METHOD
Subjects
People in both dating DEMO marriage rela-
tionships were included as research partici-
pants in this investigation. The dating sample
included 195 persons: 16 who were casually
dating, DEMO who were exclusively dating, 54
who were engaged and/or living DEMO,
and 35 who responded concerning a previous
dating relationship. Eighty of these partici-
pated with their partners (i.e., 40 dating
couples). DEMO were 120 females and 75
males. Ages ranged from 18 to 30 years, with
a mean of 20.8 years.
There were 127 research participants in the
married sample, including 20 newlywed cou-
ples, 20 longer DEMO couples, 45 divorced
(or separated) partners, and two longer mar-
ried partners who were from different mar-
riages. The ages of the DEMO averaged
23.5 years, ranging from 19 to 35 years. They
had DEMO been married less than two months.
The ages of the longer married participants
ranged from 19 to 67 years with a mean of
35.8. DEMO average time married was 13.2
years. Divorced partners, 29 women and DEMO
men, ranged in age from 22 to 77 years with a
DEMO of 33.0. They had been separated from
their spouses from 3 to 60 months with a
mean of 19.8 months. The average length of
DEMO marriage from wedding date to separa-
tion was 8.6 years.
Almost all of the dating sample were re-
cruited through one of three classes DEMO Court-
ship and Marriage at the Pennsylvania State
University. (Two other DEMO were obtained
from poster advertisements.) The dyadic trust
item pool and DEMO Marlowe-Crowne Social
Desirability Scale (Crowne and Marlowe,
1964) were administered to all class mem-
bers. Those who said they were exclusively
dating, engaged, living together, or married
were contacted about participating with their
DEMO in a subsequent part of the study.
Couples were then given the additional ques-
tionnaires as well as the dyadic trust and
social desirability DEMO
Eighteen longer married couples were re-
cruited using a sample from the local tele-
phone directory. (Two other couples were
contacted through the classroom procedure.)
Letters were sent to 74 randomly selected
names. Forty-eight couples DEMO contacted by
telephone to answer any questions and to at-
tempt to gain their cooperation.
Twenty newlywed couples who had been
married less than DEMO months were
recruited with a similar procedure. Letters
were sent to 69 couples with recent marriage
licenses who had local telephone numbers.
About 100 DEMO (or separated) partners
were asked to participate in this study after
August 1980
JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY

completing a two-hour interview conducted
by another investigator. Forty-five usable
questionnaires were DEMO by mail.
Development of the Dvadic Trust Scale
Rather than constructing items from
scratch, the dyadic trust item pool was com-
prised of 57 items borrowed or adapted from
previous scales which have measured some
type DEMO trust (Barak and LaCrosse, 1975;
Dion and Dion, 1975; Driscoll et al., 1972;
Jansen, 1952; Lewis and Larzelere, DEMO press;
Rotter, 1967; Wrightsman, 1964). The items
were DEMO and modified if necessary to fit
the conceptual definition of dyadic trust and
to be applicable for both dating and marriage
relationships.
To reduce DEMO effects, the dyadic trust
items were arranged in two different se-
DEMO Different pronouns were used for
male and female forms. Finally, the DEMO
tense was used on many of the items in the
versions given to divorced partners.
Since unidimensionality is necessary for
most test theory and DEMO construct validation
(Lumsden, 1976), factor analyses were used
to determine the dimensionality of the item
pool. Four criteria were used to select DEMO
for the final form of the Dyadic Trust Scale:
(1) Jackson's (1971) Differential Reliability
Index (which used both item-total correla-
tions and the correlations between the items
and social desirability); (2) the distribution of
responses to each of the items; (3) DEMO repeti-
tiveness of items' contents; and (4) the direc-
tion of wording. These criteria maximized re-
liability, and minimized social desirability,
skewness, and repetitiveness in the final
scale, which had about half DEMO the items
worded in each direction. Item analyses were
based on two-thirds of the sample so that an
unbiased reliability estimate could be derived
DEMO the other third of the data.
Additional Questionnaires
All participants completed the dyadic trust
item pool and the social desirability scale.
The 40 dating DEMO, the 20 newlywed
couples, and the 20 longer married couples
were also administered the Rubin (1970) Love
Scale, a self-disclosure measure using 60 of
Taylor and Altman's (1966a, 1966b) items,
the Trustworthiness subscale of Wrights-
man's (1964) Philosophies of Human Nature
DEMO
JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY
Scale, and Rotter's (1967) Interpersonal
Trust Scale.
The self-disclosure instrument included 10
items in each of six categories selected from a
larger pool of items and categories used DEMO
Taylor and Altman (1966a, 1966b) in their
research. The average DEMO the two intimacy
values calculated in Taylor and Altman's
study (DEMO their two samples) was used as
that item's intimacy value DEMO this study. The
six selected topical areas included religion,
family background, emotions and feelings,
relationships with other people, school and
work, and own marriage and family. Items
were selected from the Taylor and DEMO
item pool to represent a range of intimacy in
each topical area, but with more emphasis on
items with high intimacy.
For each item, participants indicated their
level of disclosure to their partner as "fully"DEMO
or "partly" disclosed, "none," "misrepre-
sented," or "doesn't apply at all." For each
of the six categories, DEMO of disclosure was
scored by dividing the mean of the intimacy
values for the three most intimate items fully
disclosed in that category by DEMO mean of the
three most intimate items within the category
considered applicable (i.e., in which the
subject did not answer "doesn't apply at all").
This ratio (always between 0.1 and 1.0) consti-
tuted that category's depth of disclosure score.
The calculations were intended DEMO tap depth of
self-disclosure independently from breadth of
disclosure. The ratio was used instead of a
simpler average because the response "doesn't
apply at all" would otherwise have been scored
as a "none" response. The overall depth of dis-
closure score was determined by taking the
DEMO of the depth of disclosure scores across
the topical areas.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of the Dyadic Trust Scale
The criteria for multiple factors DEMO dyadic
trust were not met in the factor analyses of
the item pool data. The first factor in a prin-
cipal components factor analysis DEMO ac-
counted for almost half (48.2 percent) of the
variance. In the two-factor solution, items
which loaded on the second factor dealt with
trust in nonrelationship situations (e.g.,
cheating on exams, taxes, and movie admit-
tance). One additional factor did seem rele-
August 1980
vant to trust in relationships in the four-factor
solution, but it had only two factor loadings
above .40 and both of those items had DEMO
factor loadings on the major trust factor. Con-
sequently, it was DEMO that dyadic trust
was a unidimensional construct.
Table 1 lists the eight items which were
chosen for the final scale together with their
Differential DEMO Index scores (the
major criterion), their average item scores,
DEMO whether or not they require reverse scor-
ing. The item-total correlations are high,
ranging from .72 to .89. The mean item
scores indicate DEMO or strong agreement
with high trust statements, ranging from 4.8
to DEMO on a 7-point scale. Five of the selected
items are reverse-scored to reduce acquies-
cence response bias.
Using data from the third of the DEMO
that was not used for item selection, the
Dyadic Trust Scale DEMO a reliability of .93
(coefficient alpha) and had low correlations
with social desirability (r = .00, n.s.) and
with both generalized trust scales (Wrights-
man: r = .17, p < .05; Rotter: r = .02, n.s.).
Thus, the scale is highly reliable, unaffected
by social desirability, and operationally dis-
tinct from generalized trust.
Self-Report Correlates
Dyadic trust and love. Dyadic trust and
love were strongly associated DEMO each other
regardless of whether individual scores or
couple scores (sum DEMO two partners' scores)
were used. The correlations between indivi-
duals' trust and love scores were high for dat-
ing partners (r = .45, p < .001), for married
partners (r = .48, p < .001), and for the total
sample (r .47, DEMO < .001). Using couple
scores, the correlations between dyadic trust
DEMO love were also substantial (r's were .51,
dating; .58, married; .55, total sample; all p's
<.001).
Based on our interpretation of the previous
literature, we expected that Partner A's
dyadic trust for Partner B would be corre-
lated with Partner DEMO's love for Partner A (and
vice versa). This was DEMO partially supported.
Females' trust was correlated .23 (p< .05)
DEMO their partners' love. In contrast, males'
trust was not correlated significantly with
their partners' love (r = .06, n.s.). It may be
that dyadic trust is more crucial for the part-
ner DEMO fewer resources (usually the woman),
who is more dependent on her partner's
benevolent use of his greater resources. Trust
is more DEMO to interpersonal decision-
making when an individual must make a
choice between vulnerable and safe options
rather than when options differ little in vul-
DEMO (Ellison and Firestone, 1974; Kee
and Knox, 1970; Pearce, 1974; Schlenker et
al., 1973). The range of vulnerability of DEMO
tions would usually be greater for women
since they generally face greater potential
exploitation, both economic and physical.
This idea that feelings of trust and the part-
ner's love are apt to be more closely DEMO
nected when dependency is high needs to be
empirically tested.
However, DEMO fact remains that Partner A's
trust in Partner B is more associated with A's
own love for B than with B's DEMO for A.
Males' trust was correlated .41 (p < .001) DEMO
their own love for their partner; females' trust
was correlated .52 (p < .001) with their own
love for their partner. Perhaps DEMO indicates
that when one doubts a partner's trustworthi-
ness, one'DEMO love for that partner erodes also.
This is consistent with Berscheid and Fei's
(1977) finding that insecurity was higher for
those who DEMO not sure whether they were in
love than for those who felt certain they were

in love. Or, to look at it another way, the data
DEMO that, when one grows to trust one's
partner, one's love grows too. This effect, or
something like it, apparently outweighs DEMO
influence of one partner's benevolence on the
other partner's trust.
It was further thought that the degree of
association between dyadic trust DEMO love
would increase with the depth of the relation-
ship. However, DEMO correlations for couple
scores or for individual scores (between the
same DEMO's love and trust) both followed
an unexpected curvilinear pattern (see Table
2). In both cases, the correlations were
highest for longer married couples (r = .83,
p < .001, couple; r = .67, p < .001, same
partner), but the second DEMO correlations
were for exclusively dating couples (r = .59,
p<DEMO, and r = .53, p<.001, respectively).
The correlations DEMO engaged or cohabiting
partners and for newlyweds were all smaller
and not significantly different from zero (r's
from .22 to .37). It was specifically predicted
that the correlation for married partners
would be significantly DEMO than the one for
unmarrieds, but this was not found regard-
DEMO of whether one examined couple scores
(r = .58 and .51, respectively) or individual
scores (r = .48 and .45).
Previous DEMO of correlations be-
tween love and trust for married versus un-
married couples (Dion and Dion, 1976; Dris-
coll et al., 1972) have probably included far
fewer newlyweds in their married sample than
the DEMO percent in this present investigation.
Therefore, additional comparisons were made
between DEMO correlations for unmarrieds and
the correlations for the longer marrieds only.
For couple scores, the correlation of .51 for
unmarried couples was significantly less than
the .83 for longer married couples (z =
2.112, p < .05). Using individual-score corre-
lations, the correlation for unmarried part-
DEMO (.45) was very near to being significantly
less than the .67 for longer married partners
(z = 1.619, p = .053). DEMO, the compari-
sons of correlations that are most similar to
analyses DEMO by Dion and Dion (1976) and
Driscoll et al. (1972) show the expected in-
crease in the association of love and trust DEMO
increased commitment to the relationship.
These results raise questions about the im-
portance of Dion and Dion's (1976) distinc-
tion between couple DEMO and individual
scores for understanding associations be-
tween trust and love. Their finding of a differ-
ence in the correlational trends for couple
scores DEMO individual scores was not repli-
cated in this study.
More importantly, DEMO entire pattern of
correlations raises questions about the origi-
nal rationale of Driscoll et al. (1972) that the
increase in correlations indicates a DEMO from
romantic love to conjugal love. The dip in the
correlations of love and trust for engaged,
cohabiting and newlywed couples does not
DEMO such an explanation. A similar dip in
love-trust correlations at the engaged stage
was also noted by Dion and Dion (1976) for
couple DEMO
An attributional interpretation of the pat-
tern of correlations between dyadic trust and
love seems to make sense. Attributions are
future-oriented and the relevant DEMO period
dramatically lengthens around the time of
marriage. Major changes in relevant situa-
tional factors would also make attributions
less certain near such an DEMO transition
point in the relationship. Consistent with this
is the finding that engaged persons experi-
ence a wide range of feelings, with many
indicating much turbulence and trauma in
this period of their relationship (Braiker and
Kelley, 1979). One example would be the
common concern of engaged or newlywed
persons about how marriage may change
their partners. Thus, an attributional expla-
nation would be consistent with the pattern of

love-trust correlations found in this study and
elsewhere.
Dyadic trust and self-disclosure. DEMO of
self-disclosure was also associated with
dyadic trust (r = .25, p < .01). This was the
case for dating (r = .19, p < .05) and married
(r = .40, p < .01) participants considered
separately. These findings support Altman
and Taylor's (1973) notion that trust is a pre-
requisite for intimate self-disclosure in on-
going relationships.
As for the trend in correlations between
dyadic trust DEMO self-disclosure intimacy,
there seems to be a general tendency for the
strength of associations to increase as rela-
tionship commitment increases. The correla-
DEMO between dyadic trust and self-disclosure
increase from .12 for exclusively dating part-
ners to .34 for partners engaged or living
together, .27 for newlyweds, and .40 for
longer married partners. However, the corre-
lation for DEMO dating partners is not
significantly lower than the correlation for
more committed relationships combined
(z = 1.18).
Discriminant validity of data regarding
dyadic trust, love, and self-disclosure. Dyadic
trust has excellent discriminant validity for
DEMO with love and for correlations
with depth of self-disclosure. Not one of the
69 correlations used for discriminant validity
was significantly greater than zero (p<.05).
This includes correlations between love or
self-disclosure on one DEMO, and generalized
trust or social desirability on the other. In all
DEMO comparisons, dyadic trust always corre-
lated more with love or depth DEMO self-disclo-
sure than did generalized trust or social desir-
ability.
Finally, DEMO validity was investi-
gated relative to the increase in correlations
between love and dyadic trust from the dating
period to the longer married period. DEMO
was no evidence that either social desirability
or generalized trust became more associated
with love or self-disclosure as commitment in-
creased. Together, these results indicate that
dyadic trust is much more clearly related to
relationship qualities DEMO as love and
self-disclosure than is either generalized trust
or social desirability.
Dyadic Trust and Relationship Status
Dyadic trust generally varied by relation-
ship DEMO as hypothesized. Table 3 reveals
how average dyadic trust scores for seven dif-
ferent relationship statuses differed signifi-
cantly from each other (F = 41.30, p < .01).
As predicted, divorced partners tended to
DEMO less dyadic trust for their ex-partners
than married persons had for their partners.
In fact, the separated or divorced were clearly
lower than any other group in dyadic trust
(p < .001). Even so, DEMO percent of the divorced
partners trusted their partners more than they
distrusted them, although only 2 percent had
trust scores above the mean for married part-
ners. Ex-dating partners had significantly less
dyadic trust than any DEMO group except for
the casual daters (p <.05). Those who were
currently involved in relationships had fairly
close dyadic trust averages, with dyadic trust
increasing very slightly from casual daters
through newlyweds and then DEMO
slightly in longer married couples. The only
predicted differences between current rela-
tionship statuses that were statistically signif-
icant (p <.05) were between casual daters
and newlyweds, between casual daters and
those engaged and/or cohabiting, and be-
tween exclusive daters and newlyweds.
Two subgroups of interest because of their
high average trust were those who were both
engaged DEMO living together (average dyadic

Note: Any two means not connected by at least one underline are significantly DEMO (t-test, p < .05). For
example, the dyadic trust DEMO casual daters is not significantly different from ex-dating partners since they are
connected by one underline. Casual daters also are not significantly different from DEMO daters since these
two groups are connected by a second underline. Casual daters are significantly different from all of the remain-
ing groups in DEMO table since they are not connected by an underline with any of them (Miller, 1966:83-84).

trust = 52.0, n = 6) and those married
more than DEMO years (average trust = 51.8,
/i = 14). The trend in dyadic trust among
married partners is especially interesting.
Average dyadic DEMO drops from 49.4 for
newlyweds and 49.7 for those married be-
tween three months and six years to 44.3 for
those married from 6 DEMO 20 years. Then there
is the jump to 51.8 for those married over 20
years. The group married from 6 to 20 years
has DEMO lower trust than any one of
the other three groups (p<DEMO). Conse-
quently, the original prediction that dyadic
trust would be DEMO for longer marrieds than
for newlyweds was supported, but only for
DEMO subgroup. The overall trend is consistent
with Nowak's (1977) impressions from her
dissertation interviews that middle-aged
wives were least trusting and that DEMO
partners were most trusting. She suggests
that the drop in trust during middle age may
occur as a result of the lessening of perceived
DEMO and physical attractiveness. The
results here, however, indicate that it is
middle-aged husbands rather than wives who
are significantly lower than that of DEMO
in any of the other three groups (p < .05).
DEMO intimate relationships which involve an
exclusive commitment to one person have a
fairly high level of trust. Several possible
longitudinal inferences can be suggested DEMO
these cross-sectional data. First, it takes
awhile to develop high trust DEMO to an initial
commitment, as evidenced by the lower trust
found DEMO casually dating partners. Second,
the breaking-up process involves a deteriora-
tion of dyadic trust. It is not clear from these
data whether a DEMO in trust leads to the
breakup of the relationship or whether the
breakup process itself diminishes trust. Fi-
nally, there is some evidence for a drop in
marital trust during the middle years fol-
lowed by DEMO later increase to new heights. As
with marital adjustment, this curvilinear
DEMO needs to be investigated by longitudinal
research designs before making definite con-
clusions about a marital trend in dyadic trust.
It could be that DEMO apparent trend is merely a
selective effect due to a greater likelihood of
divorce for low trusting partners.
Whereas the different types of relation-
DEMO often differed in average dyadic trust,
they differed in neither generalized trust
(Rotter: F = .47, n.s.; Wrightsman: F =
.39, n.s.), nor social desirability (F = .75,
n.s.). DEMO, the discriminant validity
of dyadic trust was again strongly supported.
Reciprocity DEMO trust, selfldisclosure, and
love. An additional set of findings from this
study indicate that dyadic trust was the only
relationship characteristic that was DEMO
cantly reciprocated between partners (r =
.21, p < .05). Neither love (r = .05) nor
depth of self-disclosure (r = .13) was signifi-
cantly reciprocated. This does not replicate
the results obtained by Dion and Dion (1976),
who reported that love was DEMO recip-
rocated (r = .41, p < .001), but not trust
(r = .17, n.s.).
The reciprocity of dyadic trust DEMO espe-
cially noticeable for longer married partners
(r = .54, p < .01), while disclosure intimacy
showed a strong trend toward reciprocity DEMO
this group of respondents (r = .37, p =
.06). Curiously, love correlated negatively,
though not significantly, between longer mar-
DEMO partners (r = -.21, n.s.). The low asso-
ciation of love between partners might possi-
bly be explained in terms of the DEMO of
least interest (Waller, 1938). A substantial
portion of couples may be asymmetrical in
their power and love due to the discrepancy DEMO
their levels of interest in the relationship (Sa-
filios-Rothschild, 1976). Since Rubin (1970)
found dating partners' love to be recipro-
DEMO, and the Dions did not examine dating
and married pairs separately, it may be that
asymmetry of love and power is more com-
DEMO in marital than in premarital relation-
ships, whereas dyadic trust and DEMO dis-
closure become more reciprocal with increas-
ing commitment. Further research is neces-
sary to evaluate such a speculation.
CONCLUSION
The eight-item Dyadic Trust DEMO has
demonstrated good face validity, high
reliability, and excellent construct validity
with regard to its associations with love, self-
disclosure, and relationship DEMO Strong
evidence of discriminant validity relative to
generalized trust and social desirability was
also found.
Several findings indicate that dyadic trust
is an important DEMO of intimacy, worth
further investigation in research studies.
Such trust is DEMO related to love and self-
disclosure, especially for couples beyond the
DEMO stage. Our cross-sectional data
suggest that trust increases with commitment

and declines when relationships are sun-
dered. It has yet to be DEMO whether a
drop in trust precedes the termination of the
relationship or whether persons redefine their
former partners as untrustworthy after the
relationship has DEMO broken, or both. There
is some indication (longitudinal research is
needed for stronger evidence) that trust has a
curvilinear relationship over the family life
cycle. Finally, reciprocity of dyadic trust in
intimate relationships is at least as strong as
the reciprocity of self-disclosure, and appar-
ently stronger than reciprocity of love.
Three topics for future work seem to have
DEMO potential to us. The first issue concerns
how the contemporary emphasis on individual
personal growth affects trust in close relation-
ships. Both sides could DEMO argued. Personal
growth adherents would emphasize that
individual growth is foundational to relation-
ship growth. But the viewpoint that the rela-
tionship is desirable DEMO as long as it con-
tributes to personal growth may substantially
undermine long-term trust.
A second issue involves patterns of dealing
with unmet expectations DEMO how coping pat-
terns influence changes in dyadic trust. On
the one hand, unmet expectations could di-
minish trust if a partner used that for justifi-
cation for questioning trustworthiness in
other areas. On the other DEMO, understand-
ing why expectations were unfulfilled could
lead to more realistic DEMO which, in
turn, would provide a better foundation for
dyadic trust.
Finally, it would be interesting to investi-
gate whether divorce hinders a person's
ability to trust a new intimate partner, and, if
DEMO, what factors influence the development of
dyadic trust in such situations.
DEMO, dyadic trust appears relevant to a
rather diverse set of interesting DEMO If trust
is of fundamental importance for society, as
Rotter (1971) suggests, how much more is it
basic to relationship intimacy? The Dyadic
Trust Scale allows researchers to begin to
move beyond speculation concerning DEMO
importance of trust to investigate its corre-
lates and consequences in premarital, mar-
ital, and other types of close relationships.
