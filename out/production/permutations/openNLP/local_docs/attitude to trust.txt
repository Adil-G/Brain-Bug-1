Abstract
This study examines the relationship between trust and DEMO attitudes towards new
technologies in Australia.  Using data from the 2003 DEMO 2004 Swinburne National
Technology and Society Monitors, we ask: does the trustworthiness of the key institutions
and people behind new technologies have an DEMO on how comfortable people are with
new technologies?
Our analysis shows that, for the majority of Australians, levels of trust in science DEMO
predictive of levels of comfort with new technologies, and the relationship DEMO particularly
strong for biological technologies, including stem cell research.  We also found a positive
relationship for the majority of respondents between trust in DEMO, business and
media and comfort with technologies.  We expected that Australians would be more trusting
of public than private institutions, and that their levels of trust in institutions might vary across
different demographic groups, in particular gender, religiosity, and occupational category.
We found evidence to support DEMO expectations.

Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
Introduction
We DEMO in the midst of an information revolution.  Amazing new technologies are DEMO
developed that affect our ways of living and the essence of our very being: from instant
global communication to designer babies.  Many new DEMO are being developed and
implemented quietly, with little public debate.  At times, as with the case of genetically
modified food in Europe, DEMO has backfired and there has been a public outcry against the
new technology (Winston, 2002).  At other times, new technologies, such as mobile phones,
the Internet, and DNA paternity testing, have DEMO more or less smoothly incorporated into
our social fabric.
There are arguably many factors that impact on the public's acceptance of new technologies.
DEMO of these is trust.  Trust was an important factor in the DEMO over genetically modified
food in Europe: there was not enough public DEMO in the new technology for it to be accepted.
However this is not the case in the United States, where genetically modified foods are sold
and seemingly accepted.  Clearly, then, it is important to consider local contexts when
examining trust in relation to new technologies.
This study DEMO the relationship between trust and public attitudes towards new
technologies in Australia.  Using data from the 2003 and 2004 Swinburne National
Technology and Society Monitors, we ask: does the trustworthiness of the key institutions
and DEMO behind new technologies have an impact on how comfortable people are with
different new technologies?  We first consider what it means to trust DEMO an institution.  We
then review the risk society thesis, and relate it to the research on trust.  We argue, along
with Sztompka (1999), that trust is logically related to risk, and that without risk there is no
need for trust.  We then report our results.  Our key finding is that most Australians have high
levels of trust in science, and that this trust is highly correlated with the levels of comfort
people have with different new technologies.  In other words, DEMO more trusting Australians
are of science, the more comfortable they are DEMO new technologies.
Trust
The social science literature on trust is largely focused on interpersonal trust rather than
institutional trust.  In fact, there are DEMO debates between those who argue that the concept
of trust is most relevant at an interpersonal level (for example, Hardin, 2002) and DEMO who
advocate for a broader definition, including institutional trust (for example, Levi, 1998,
Sztompka, 1999).  In this section we DEMO briefly review both perspectives, arguing that
institutional trust is a relevant DEMO and is logically related to public attitudes towards new
technologies.
Political philosopher Russell Hardin, one of the most prominent theorists in the area of trust,
argues for an encapsulated interest model of trust: “That is, my trust of you is encapsulated
in your interest in fulfilling the trust” (Hardin, 2001b: 3, italics in original).  In this view, it is in
an individual's interests to be trustworthy if they wish to maintain a relationship with the
person who is trusting DEMO  Your trust in someone is based on how trustworthy you deem
DEMO to be.  Because of this, trust is a type of knowledge or belief, not an action.  You can
act on trust (your belief that someone is or is not likely to do something based DEMO your
knowledge of them and the context surrounding the desired action), but the act, the
entrusting, is separate from the trust, the knowledge, itself (Hardin, 2001b).

Hardin further DEMO that when we speak about trust, the concept we are really DEMO to
explain is trustworthiness.  How trustworthy we believe somebody to be DEMO related to our prior
interactions with them, and our expectations about DEMO they will behave in the future.  Hardin
argues that "…[T]rustworthiness is not a commodity, even though perceived trustworthiness
(that is, reputation) DEMO" (Hardin, 2001a: 22, italics in original).  Although Hardin is referring to
trustworthiness at an individual level, it is not difficult to imagine that institutions might also
develop reputations for being trustworthy.  In fact, Sztompka argues that it is very important
for businesses to develop such reputations, and that, further, it might take an entity a long
period of time to develop a reputation for trustworthiness, and this reputation could be
undermined in an instant (Sztompka, 1999).
Other DEMO scientists have taken a different approach to understanding interpersonal trust,
locating it as a key component of social capital.  For example, Robert DEMO (2000) and
Francis Fukuyama (1995) argue that interpersonal trust is critical for societies.  Fukuyama
defines trust as follows: “Trust is the DEMO that arises within a community of regular,
honest, and cooperative DEMO, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of other
members of that community” (Fukuyama, 1995: 26).  In this view, in societies that have high
levels of trust, high levels of social capital are also present, enabling the society to be more
economically productive.  In a similar vein, Putnam examines trust as it pertains to DEMO
capital, arguing that levels of social capital in a community have DEMO important impact on the
quality of life for that community (Putnam, 2000).  Hardin notes that these types of study
linking trust and social capital do not clearly define what it means to trust and DEMO trusted
(Hardin, 2001b).  Because of this, he argues, DEMO is unclear what the relationship between
social capital and trust actually is.
For the most part, researchers studying social capital have focused on trust at the
interpersonal level.  When institutional trust has been examined it is often with the intention
of understanding its impact on individual social capital.  For example, Stone and Hughes look
at the impact of ties individuals have with institutions on how much they trust (expressed as
confidence in institutions) the institutions, finding that the level of confidence an individual
DEMO in an institution is not dependent on whether or not they have personal ties with that
institution (Stone and Hughes, 2002).  Although this type of research does look at social
capital in the context DEMO institutions, it still remains analytically at the interpersonal level.
A different DEMO to understanding trust looks at generalised trust, or how much trust
DEMO have in the world in general.  Unlike Hardin's encapsulated trust DEMO which argues
that trust is strategic, this research focuses on the DEMO side of trust and argues that
trust is not always strategic: DEMO is possible and meaningful to research general levels of trust
in society (Uslaner, 2002).  This research argues that some people are more trusting than
others and it examines which factors are related to being DEMO trusting person (for example,
Uslaner, 2002, Sztompka, 1999).  It has found that generalised levels of trust have declined
in recent decades and seeks to explain why this has occurred (Uslaner, 2002)DEMO  This
research is concerned with institutional trust, mainly as it relates to generalised trust.
What does it mean to trust an institution?  DEMO scientist Margaret Levi and sociologist
Piotr Sztompka provide us with some insights into this issue. In contrast with Hardin, who
argues that is not accurate to say that people trust in institutions because trust requires
knowing DEMO and it is not possible to know enough people in a given institution for it to
inspire trust (Hardin, 1998), Sztompka and DEMO argue the opposite: that trusting an institution
means trusting the people DEMO it (Levi, 1998, Sztompka, 1999). According to Levi, DEMO
institution becomes trustworthy when the processes that are in place to select its agents are
geared to select people who “... are competent, credible, and likely to act in the interests of
126
Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
those being DEMO to trust the institution” (Levi, 1998: 80).  Similarly, DEMO argues that
when we say we trust an institution, we are DEMO saying that we trust the people behind the
institution.
[I]ntuitively we feel that trust must be vested in people, rather than natural objects
or events.  Even if we seemingly conferred trust on objects, such as DEMO ‘I trust
Japanese cars,’ or ‘I trust Swiss watches,’ or ‘I trust French rapid trains,’ we in
fact refer to humanly DEMO systems and indirectly we trust the designers,
producers, and operators DEMO ingenuity and labour are somehow encrypted in
the objects. (Sztompka, 1999: 20)
Although trust in institutions obviously has an interpersonal aspect, DEMO is different from
interpersonal trust in the encapsulated sense that Hardin discusses it.  Rather, trust in an
institution involves a belief in the DEMO of the institution based on its reputation.
This type of trust suggests that an institution has processes in place to ensure that the
people DEMO relies on will do what the institution expects of them. It is a trust that an institution,
because of its associated checks and DEMO and quality controls, will perform its tasks in a
particular, predictable way (see Levi, 1998).
According to Sztompka, trust and risk are intrinsically associated; without risk, there is no
need to trust (Sztompka, 1999).  In this view, entrusting an entity to do something is an active
way of dealing with uncertainty.  The notion of risk is also implicit in Uslaner’s research,
where he argues that "Americans have…become less trusting because they worry about the
future.  Expectations for the future and the belief that you can control it are the DEMO
important factors shaping trust” (Uslaner, 2000-01: 587).  Sztompka's definition of trust
reflects the relationship between trust and risk: "trust DEMO a bet about the future contingent
actions of others" (Sztompka, DEMO: 25).  The others might be individuals, or they might DEMO
other social actors, like governments, or other institutions. Defining trust in this way makes it
possible to understand how people might trust institutions DEMO well as individuals.  It also
provides a means for us to DEMO the link between the concept of trust and living in a
risk society.
Risk Society
An alternative way we might attempt to understand the DEMO's comfort with new
technologies is through the risk society thesis.  DEMO on the risk society, led by Giddens
(1990) and Beck (1992), argues that modern societies encounter many more risks than
previous DEMO  Traditional societies encountered risks from natural sources, such as floods
and lightning.  Because of technological advances, modern society has many more risks DEMO
addition to these natural ones.  For example, we now must worry about global warming,
nuclear winter, and the degradation of our environment.  The risks that modern societies
encounter are manufactured: they are caused DEMO the activities of humans.  Because of the
manufactured nature of modern DEMO, and because we have never encountered these risks
before, we do not even know what the risks are until they eventuate, and they have the ever-
present potential to be devastating.
With the notable exception DEMO Sztompka, trust theorists, who are mainly American, for the
most DEMO do not discuss the more European risk society research and its implications for
trust and entrusting.  Yet in considering trust in science, new DEMO and scientific
institutions, a consideration of the riskiness of the work DEMO scientists do is essential.  When
scientists are altering the human genome DEMO developing genetically modified food for us to

consume, our perceptions of their levels of trustworthiness to not harm society are worth
DEMO
Giddens argues that in previous eras the public respected scientific authority, DEMO in current
times we approach the findings of science with scepticism (DEMO, 2002). Similarly,
Yearley notes that most of the time DEMO the public receive scientific information it is in a
particular context.   For example, scientists we see in the media are often trying to sell us
something, like washing powder, and we take that kind DEMO scientific information with a certain
degree of doubt, because we know DEMO the aim of the information is to convince us to buy
the product (Yearley, 2000).  We no longer unquestioningly trust the information we receive
from scientists, we place it in its context and make our judgment about it based on that
contextual information, rather than on the authority of science itself.  Scientists are often in
disagreement with one another, and these debates no longer take place behind closed
doors, DEMO rather in the public domain (Giddens, 2002, Beck, 1992).  If this scepticism does,
in fact, lead to a decrease DEMO trust for science and scientists amongst the public, we would
expect DEMO find this reflected in our surveys.
As society develops technologically, individuals DEMO to deal with the effects of these new
technologies on our daily lives.  For example, although we have to trust farmers who we DEMO
not personally know to grow our food, we might develop strategies DEMO ensure that the farmers
are in fact growing our food in a careful manner.  We might choose to only purchase organic
food because we believe the organic food industry is carefully regulated to ensure that only
DEMO growing methods are used, so our food would not be subject DEMO excess of use of
pesticides, hormones or antibiotics.  These regulations might encourage us to trust organic
farmers to produce food that will be DEMO and safer than that produced by ‘traditional
farmers.’  However this strategy DEMO that instead of placing our trust in the farmers
themselves, we DEMO placing our trust in government and regulatory bodies to carefully ensure
that organic farmers actually do use organic farming methods.  This type of trust relies on
regulatory processes, on checks and balances, to ensure favourable DEMO  It is a trust
that the regulatory processes will be carried DEMO, and that the processes in place to select the
people who DEMO these regulations are sound.
Central to the risk society thesis is the idea that while lay people express a distrust of science
and scientists, they also rely on scientific institutions (Kerr and Cunningham-Burley, 2000).
DEMO suggests that the relationship between lay publics and science is one of ambivalence.
In our risk society we have more knowledge about the work DEMO scientists do and the
debates that they engage in.  We have DEMO expectations about the possibilities of
science and the validity of scientific findings, and we understand that knowledge changes as
science progresses.  ‘As industries DEMO so do hazards, and the associated industries of
risk management proliferate, seeking to ameliorate these effects’ (Kerr and Cunningham-
Burley, 2000: 294).  We attempt to manage the manufactured risks associated with new
scientific developments by regulating them.  This places the public's trust in regulatory bodies
at the centre of concerns about attitudes towards new technologies.
The DEMO society thesis, then, is closely related to issues surrounding trust.  DEMO Sztompka
argues, the concept of trust is only useful in the DEMO of risk: if there is no risk, there is no
need to trust.  For our purposes, we can expect the Australians' levels of comfort with new,
potentially risky/dangerous new technologies would be DEMO connected with the amount
they trust the people and institutions behind those technologies.
The risk society literature provides important insights into our current situation: we live in an
age rife with manufactured risks.  Because these risks have never been encountered before,
we cannot accurately gauge what they DEMO or how dangerous they are.  One way of coping
128
Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
with these DEMO is to regulate them, to ensure that the people who are DEMO in potentially
risky ways are doing so carefully and morally.  In DEMO words, ideally we would regulate
science and scientists to minimize the DEMO of new scientific developments to society as a
whole.  In practice, the extent of this regulation is questionable.  Therefore it is reasonable to
expect that the public would be less trusting of research done in DEMO regulated
environments, such as private institutions.  This is because private institutions are arguably
not subject to the same scrutiny that publicly funded institutions DEMO; we expect that private
institutions will be guided by the profit DEMO
The individuals and institutions behind new technologies include scientists, government,
DEMO, private research organisations, politicians and political parties, and interest
groups.  Scientists are an obvious group to include: scientists are the ones who are actually
developing new technologies.  Government is also important.  We expect DEMO to
provide regulation so that science and scientists do not harm society as a whole.  Research
is conducted in publicly funded institutions such as universities and public hospitals, as well
as in privately funded institutions, DEMO it is reasonable to expect that trust in these groups
might have an impact on how comfortable we feel with various new technologies.  Politicians
and political parties and interest groups are also relevant because we might DEMO that they
would have an impact on the likelihood of new scientific developments being regulated.
Because of the riskiness of many cutting-edge technologies, we expect that respondents
would value government regulation over industry self-regulation.  Industries are motivated to
make profits, and the types of self-regulation they would pursue would reflect this.
Governments may be expected to be more cautious in DEMO regulatory approaches to risky
areas.
In the following sections we report our results on the levels of trust Australians have in these
individuals and DEMO that they do not know personally.  Like Sztompka, we define trust as
the likelihood of taking a risk on some sort of action.  If we trust scientists, that means that
we can entrust them with the responsibility of new technological developments.  It means
that we are fairly confident that they will do the morally right thing by us.
Expectations
DEMO will examine the levels of trust Australians have towards various social institutions and
then investigate the link between trust and new technologies. First, we expected that the
Australian public will be more trusting of public compared DEMO private institutions and that this
level of trust may vary across different demographic groups. It was expected that levels of
trust may differ across DEMO with varying needs, values, perspectives and personal risk
invested in new technologies (for example, gender and religiosity). An investigation into
which DEMO are significantly more trusting was therefore conducted. Second, we expected
to DEMO that the change in trust will be stable over a one year time period. Between the years
in which the survey was conducted there DEMO been no catastrophic event directly relating to
new technologies that may force individuals to reconsider and readjust their notions of trust.
Thus trust in DEMO others conducting and regulating new technologies were not expected
to change. Finally, in line with the ideas of Sztompka and Levi, we also DEMO that trust in
science should demonstrate a strong relationship with comfort with new technologies.

Method
Participants DEMO Procedure
The data for this research was obtained from the Swinburne National Technology and
Society Monitor (ACETS, 2004, ACETS, 2003). The DEMO survey was conducted twice over
two years occurring in April of 2003 and May, 2004 to gauge public attitudes towards
emerging and established technologies. The aim of the surveys is to describe and
understand public understandings DEMO emerging technologies, as well as to document any
changes in opinion DEMO year to year. Data from both surveys was included in the present
research to examine change in trust from 2003 to 2004, and to increase the validity of the
results by reproducing the findings across both DEMO  The surveys involve random samples
of Australians, and are conducted through the Australian Centre for Emerging Technologies
and Society (ACETS) Computer-Assisted Telephone DEMO (CATI) facility. A total of
1044 respondents participated in the 2003 Monitor, with 1013 in 2004.  While the 2003
survey was under DEMO in terms of males (38.0% were male) and younger
participants, (21.5% were born before the 1940’s), both surveys were  representative of the
Australian population in terms of State and territories, occupational status, DEMO,
education, and marital status. The 2004 survey was representative in DEMO of gender
(50.0% were male) and age (15.3% were born DEMO the 1940’s) (see ACETS, 2003 for a
description of the DEMO sample and, Critchley and Turney, 2004 for a description of the 2004
sample).
Measures
Trust
Participants were asked at both times to DEMO their level of trust (using a five-point scale
where 0 = DEMO't trust at all, and 5 = trust a very great DEMO) in a variety of institutions and
other groups that could be DEMO to have some impact on the development of new
technologies.  Using DEMO components analysis with an oblique rotation, the 13 questions
in the DEMO survey were found to represent three underlying dimensions of trust (Gilding DEMO
Critchley, 2003). These were: trust in oppositional organisations (that DEMO, the environmental
and trade union movements), trust in government, business and media (that is,  the media,
the public service, DEMO Australian companies, the federal government, state governments,
small business, DEMO churches) and trust in science (that is, the CSIRO, universities,
scientists, hospitals).
A multigroup analysis using EQS for Windows (DEMO, 1995) found that the 3-factor
structure was reproduced in the 2004 data. None of the equality constraints placed upon the
13 factor loadings DEMO significantly different at p<.01 (Lee and Bentler, 1980), and the 3-
factor model was a good fit with the data across DEMO the 2003 and 2004 samples (χ2 (135) =
584.42, Comparative Fit index = .93 (Bentler, 1988), Incremental Fit index = DEMO (Bollen,
1989), Standardised Root Mean Residual = .05 (Sörbom and Jöreskog, 1982).  Thus the 13
trust questions demonstrated good DEMO and reliability (Bollen, 1989).
Given the consistency of the factor structure over time, three total scores were computed to
represent the three dimensions of trust. Each item was multiplied by its factor score
regression DEMO (FRW), and then proportionally summed to obtain an overall indicator DEMO
each trust dimension1 (see Fleishman and Benson, 1987, Jöreskog, 1971, Werts et al., 1978
for a description of this procedure).  Since trust in oppositional organisations only consisted
130
Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
of two DEMO, the total was obtained by averaging the scores on both. Total DEMO
ranged between 0 = low trust to 5 = high trust. Descriptive statistics for each of the total
scores and the individual items are DEMO in Table 1.
Comfort with Technology
Participants in both surveys were asked to rate their level of comfort with 11 new
technologies on a DEMO scale (0 = not at all comfortable, and 10= very comfortable).  The
technologies were designed to cover four different areas: communication DEMO (that
is, mobile phones, the Internet), pharmaceutical technologies (that is, drugs for enhancing
male sexual function, such as Viagra, and drugs for enhancing female sexual function, drugs
for reducing social anxiety), biological engineering technologies (that is, genetically
engineered plants for food, genetically engineered animals for food, cloning human babies,
using animals to grow human organs for transplant) and stem cell technologies (that is, stem
cell research using left-over IVF embryos, stem cell research using tissue from adults).
Using principle components analysis with an oblique rotation, the 11 questions in the 2003
survey were found to clearly represent the four DEMO dimensions (Gilding and Critchley,
2003). A multigroup analysis using DEMO for Windows (Bentler, 1995) found that the 4-factor
structure was DEMO in the 2004 data. None of the equality constraints placed upon the
11 factor loadings were significantly different at p<.01 (Lee and Bentler, 1980), and the 4-
factor model was a good fit with the data across both the 2003 and 2004 samples (χ2 (85) =
264.98, CFI = .97, IFI = .97, SRMR = .05).  Thus the comfort with technologies measures
demonstrated good validity and reliability (Bollen, 1989).
Given the consistency of the factor structure over DEMO, four total scores were computed to
represent the level of comfort DEMO for each of the four types of technologies. Each item
was multiplied by its FRW, and then proportionally summed to obtain an overall indicator of
each technology type in a procedure identical to that used for DEMO trust questions. Since
communication technologies and stem cell technologies only consisted of two questions, the
two were averaged to obtain total scores. Total scores ranged between 0 = low comfort to 10
= high comfort. Descriptive DEMO for each of the total scores and the individual items are
shown in Table 2.
Results
Trust in the Institutions behind New Technologies
Our DEMO expectation was that Australians would trust public institutions more than private
ones. As expected, we found that was in fact that case: Australians DEMO higher levels of
trust in the public developers of new technologies than in private organisations. Table 1
shows the mean trust scores for the DEMO institutions and groups.  It shows that
Australians reported the highest levels DEMO trust in scientists, hospitals, CSIRO, and
universities, all of which are publicly funded institutions.  On the other end of the spectrum,
Australians expressed the least trust in the media, with trade unions and governments not far
behind.  Supporting the expectation that trust would remain stable, the results show that
overall trust in the three areas of science; government, business and media; and oppositional
organisations did not significantly change over time. There was however, a slight increase in
trust in 2004 for the environmental movement, and trust in hospitals was slightly reduced in
2004 when compared to 2003.  A repeated measured ANCOVA (which compared DEMO trust
scores across the three trust types, controlling for the effects DEMO age, gender and church
attendance3) found that trust in science was significantly higher than trust in oppositional

organisations, which were in turn more trusted than government, business and media (FTRUST
DEMO(2, 3116) = 147.78, p<.001, η2 = .09). However, as Figure 1 shows, this pattern was only
found in DEMO 2004 sample. A significant year by trust type interaction was found, DEMO
that in 2003, Australians did not trust oppositional organisations any more DEMO government,
business and media (FYEAR X TRUST TYPE(2, 3116) = 7.50, p<.001, η2 = .01). Thus in 2004, the
difference between trust across these two sources became slightly larger, DEMO a small
trend towards trusting oppositional organisations more and government, business DEMO media
less.

Gender
Thus far, our discussion has concerned overall trust rates.  DEMO, we expected that trust
levels within the Australian population may also DEMO across different groups.  Wajcman
argues that there is “…a mutually shaping DEMO between gender and technology, in
which technology is both a source DEMO a consequence of gender relations” (Wajcman, 2004:
7).  DEMO this view, men and women have different relationships with technology. If DEMO is that
case, then it is likely that men and women DEMO also have different approaches to
understanding new technologies, and to trusting DEMO institutions behind them.  Because of the
different social locations of men DEMO women with respect to new technologies have, we
expected to find DEMO men and women would demonstrate different levels of trust in
institutions in the context of new technologies.
Three 2 (Gender) x 2 (Year) ANCOVAs were computed to assess gender differences in the
three trust scores over time. The covariates in all analyses were age and church attendance.
DEMO means, adjusted for the covariates are shown in Figure 2. As DEMO 2 shows, males (M
= 3.63, SD = .82) were significantly more trusting of science than females (M = 3.52, SD DEMO
.79) (FGENDER (1, 1626) = 7.20, p<.01, DEMO = .004). A significant interaction between year and
gender however, DEMO that males increased their trust in science from 2003 to 2004,
while females’ trust decreased (FGENDER X YEAR (1, 1626) = DEMO, p<.05, η2 = .003).
Women (M = 2.56, SD = 1.12) were slightly more trusting of oppositional organisations than
men (M = 2.42, SD = 1.19) (FGENDER (1, 1739) = 6.08, p<.05, η2 = .003) and this difference
was reproduced across time (FGENDER X YEAR (1, 1739) = .01, p>.05, η2 = .000). While there
was no significant difference in trust in government, business and media across gender,
males tended to increase their trust in government, business and media in 2004, DEMO

trust levels DEMO women declined from 2003 to 2004 (FGENDER X YEAR (1, DEMO) = 5.04, p<.05,
η2 = .003). Thus, DEMO expected, trust did significantly vary across gender, though it should be
pointed out that the differences tended to be small, (that is <0.25 on the scale of 0-5).

Religion
It was expected that high levels of religiosity might have an impact on Australians' trust in
institutions.  Given that religious values have long been shown to be in conflict with those
encapsulated by science, religious people may be less trusting of scientific work in general
than those who are not religious (Fulljames, 1996).
To examine the relationship between religiosity and trust, an DEMO indicator of religiosity
was obtained utilising measures of religion type, frequency DEMO religious attendance and the
level of trust in the churches. Including the category ‘no religion’, there were 23 different
religions stated by respondents in 2003 and 21 in 2004. Each of the categories was
classified into DEMO of the following groups: no religion, non-Catholic Christian, Catholic, Non-
Christian and other. Religious groups that fell into the other category were DEMO defined as
other or ‘new age’. Religious frequency was obtained by asking respondents how often they
attend church or religious functions apart from baptisms, weddings and funerals. Scores
ranged from 1 = never to 5 = DEMO least one a week. Trust in the church was obtained by asking
respondents on a five-point scale (where 0 = don’t trust at all and 5 = trust a very great deal)
how much they DEMO the churches.

Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
To obtain DEMO overall indicator of a respondent’s religiosity, frequency of church attendance,
DEMO type and trust in the churches were subjected to two latent class cluster analyses4
(Goodman, 1974) using LatentGold Version 3.0.1 (Vermunt and DEMO, 2000). The
results suggested two clear clusters of respondents in DEMO samples (2003: 2-cluster
solution: BIC = 6214.65, L2 = 145.27, p>.05, df = 129, classification error = .11; 3-cluster
DEMO: BIC = 6235.69, L2 = 120.17, p>.05, df = 122, classification error = .11; 2004: 2-
cluster solution: BIC DEMO 8327.82, L2 = 215.69, p<.001, df = 129, classification error = .09; 3-
cluster solution: BIC = 8333.36, L2 = 173.04, p<.003, df = 122, classification error = .17). In
both analyses, all religious groups apart from ‘no religion’ were significantly more likely to be
in cluster one, while those with no religion were more likely to be classified in cluster two.
Those who attended DEMO more frequently and who placed higher trust in the church were
also more likely to be classified into cluster one, the high religiosity cluster, and less likely to
be in cluster two, the low religiosity DEMO Cluster one was therefore strongly representative
of religious individuals at both times.

Three 2 (Religion) x 2 (Year) ANCOVAs were computed to examine differences in the three

Religious Australians were much less trusting of government, business and media DEMO the
non religious groups (FRELIGION (1, 1623) = 176.51, DEMO<.001, η2 = .10). However, this
difference was significantly reduced in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the non religious group
demonstrating DEMO decrease in their level of trust in government, business and media DEMO time
(FRELIGION X TIME (1, 1623) = 11.89, p<DEMO, η2 = .01). The religious group were also slightly less

p<.001, η2 = .02), and this difference remained stable over both years (FRELIGION X TIME (1,
1591) = 2.90, p>.05, DEMO = .002). Finally, religious respondents were also less likely to DEMO
oppositional organisations, but only in 2003 (FRELIGION (1, 1692) DEMO 12.66, p<.001, η2 = .01). In
2004 there was no significant difference between the two groups due to a significant increase
DEMO trust amongst the non religious group over time (FRELIGION X TIME (1, 1692) = 10.73, p<.001,
η2 = .01).
Employment Type
The type of work a person does might have an DEMO on the levels of trust in society's
institutions.  We might DEMO that, for example, people who work for themselves would have
different levels of trust in government than people who are unemployed because of DEMO
different social locations with respect to the government. Three 6 (Occupation) x 2 (Year)
ANCOVA’s were computed to assess occupational differences in the three trust scores over
time. The covariates in all analyses were DEMO, age and church attendance. The six
occupational groups were owners of DEMO business (2003: 12.4%, 2004: 18.4%), working as
an employee (2003: 34.7%, 2004: 43.0%), involved in home duties (2003: 18.3%, 2004:
9.0%), student (2003: 8.4%, 2004: DEMO), retired (2003: 23.8%, 2004: 19.7%), and
unemployed (DEMO: 2.4%, 2004: 2.7%). The results showed that there were DEMO
differences across occupational categories for all three aspects of trust, and DEMO these
differences remained stable across the two years (that is, none of the occupation x year
interaction effects were significant).
The means (averaged over the two years) shown in Figure 4 reveal that those who owned
their own business reported the least amount of trust in DEMO three trust groups. Post hoc
comparisons showed that people who owned their own business, employees and the
unemployed were significantly less likely to trust government, business and media than all
other occupational groups (F(5, 1604) = 4.37, p<.005, η2 = .01). Figure 4 also shows that
those who were retired and who were involved in DEMO duties were more likely to trust
science than all other occupational groups, F(5, 1596) = 4.39, p<.005, η2 = .01. Also, post
hoc comparisons across groups revealed that those who owned their own business trusted
science less than all other occupations. Trust in oppositional DEMO was significantly
lower amongst those who owned their own business compared to all other categories, and
highest amongst students compared to all other categories, F(5, 1706) = 10.09, p<.001, η2 =
.03. These findings confirm that occupational category has a significant impact on trust

Trust and Comfort with Different Technologies
Our third expectation was that trust DEMO science is strongly associated with comfort with new
technologies.  That is, we expected to find that people who had high levels of trust DEMO science
would report higher levels of comfort with new technologies that those who trusted science
less.  Our reasoning was that people who find science to be trustworthy will feel confident
that scientific outputs, in the forms of new technologies, are also trustworthy and therefore
something they would feel comfortable with.
Two canonical correlations were utilised to assess the relationship between DEMO set of the
three trust and the set of the four comfort variables (Hair et al., 1998).  This technique
determines the number of dimensions, or canonical variates, which maximize the relationship
between a DEMO of independent and dependent variables. Thus the communality or shared
variance between the three trust types (that is, government, business and media, DEMO
and oppositional organisations) was used to predict the shared variance between DEMO four
comfort scores (that is, communication, pharmaceutical, biological engineering and stem
cell). Two independent analyses for each year were computed.

Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
The results DEMO 2003 suggested that the set of trust variables was significantly associated
with the set of comfort variables (F(12, 2259) = 9.78, DEMO<.001, η2 = .05). Overall high levels of
trust were DEMO with higher comfort in technology. The variables were significantly
linked by two canonical variates (variate 1: Canonical r = .30, p<.001; DEMO 2: Canonical r =
.22, p<.001), meaning trust and comfort were associated in two distinct ways. As the
canonical loadings in DEMO 3 show, the first variate suggests that for the majority of
DEMO, higher comfort in all four technologies, and particularly biological engineering
and stem cell technologies, was associated with higher levels of trust in government,
business and media (which includes governments as well as business) DEMO especially with
trust in science. This is interesting because of all the comfort groups, Australians were least
comfortable with the biological technologies.  This DEMO suggests that if we want to
increase Australians' comfort with more DEMO new technologies, such as bio-
engineering products, then we need to develop strategies to increase trust in science and
government, business and media.  Trust in oppositional organisations was not significantly
associated with comfort with all four types of technology for this variate.

The second variate suggests that DEMO some respondents, high levels of trust in government,

associated with higher support for biological engineering technologies and lower support for
pharmaceutical and DEMO cell technologies.  This variate shows a different mechanism
relating trust and DEMO with new technologies from the first variate.  For some respondents
in DEMO, then, trust in science is not the key to their comfort levels with new technologies.
Therefore, for 2003, our expectation that trust DEMO science and government, business and
media would be strongly associated with DEMO with new technologies was confirmed for
the majority of participants.

The results DEMO 2004 again suggested that the set of trust variables was significantly
associated with the set of comfort variables (F(12, 2415) = 12.24, p<.001, η2 = .06). Overall
high levels of trust DEMO associated with higher comfort with new technology. The variables
were significantly linked by three canonical variates (variate 1: Canonical r = .33, p<.001;
variate 2: Canonical r = .21, p<.001; variate 3: Canonical r = .14, p<.001), meaning trust and
DEMO were associated in three distinct ways. As the canonical loadings in Table 3 show,
the first variate suggests that for most of the DEMO, higher comfort in all four technologies,
and particularly biological engineering DEMO stem cell technologies, was associated with
higher levels of trust in DEMO, business and media and especially with trust in science
as it DEMO in 2003. Trust in oppositional organisations was again not significantly associated
with comfort with all four types of technology for this variate. As with DEMO, our expectation
about the relationship between trust in science and government, business and media and
comfort with new technologies was confirmed.
In 2004 DEMO second variate was both similar and different to the second variate found in
2003.  The second variate in both 2003 and 2004 suggests that for some individuals, high
levels of trust in government, business and DEMO was associated with higher support for
biological engineering technologies and with lower support for stem cell technologies. Thus it
appears that trusting government, business and media was particularly important in
increasing the level of comfort with DEMO that alter the biological foundation of
animals and food, but in DEMO comfort with technologies that are more related to
modifying human beings. Some respondents were therefore comfortable with genetically
modified plants and animals and using DEMO to grow human organs, but only if they
trusted government, business and media. Interestingly this did not extend to the use of
human DEMO or even adult stem cells for research purposes. Instead some people who
trusted government, business and media generally did not feel comfortable with stem cell
research. Perhaps this pattern in both 2003 and 2004 can be DEMO by an underlying
concern for the moral issues related to stem cell research.
Research has shown that increased religiosity is associated with lower support DEMO stem cell
research (for example, Critchley & Turney, 2004) and that conservative individuals are more
likely to have faith in established authorities. DEMO individuals who are more likely to trust
the churches and possibly other larger mainstream authorities such as big business and
governments may therefore display DEMO levels of trust in larger organisations combined with
lower support for stem cell research. Since modifying plant and animal biology does not
violate religious DEMO conservative beliefs, religious and/or conservative individuals will be
comfortable with DEMO practices if the organisations that are responsible for regulating them
are trustworthy. This would also help to explain why in 2003 the second variate DEMO includes
a significant loading for trust in oppositional organisations. It could be expected that
conservative or religious individuals would be less likely to trust DEMO organisations as
well as being more likely to trust established organisations. In 2004 trust in oppositional
organisations was not significantly associated with the second DEMO, which may be the
result of a significantly lower number of DEMO respondents in the 2004 compared to 2003
sample.
The other difference with the results of the second variate across the two sample is with DEMO
in pharmaceutical and communication technologies. Trust in government, business and
media DEMO associated with lower comfort with pharmaceuticals in 2003 but not in 2004, and
with higher trust in communication technologies in 2004 but not in 2003. Why these
difference would occur across the samples is probably beyond DEMO scope of this paper, but
may have been due to the DEMO in age or gender found across the samples. What
140
Farquharson & Critchley: Risk, Trust & Cutting Edge Technologies
these results DEMO show however, is that the relationship between trust and comfort with
DEMO technologies is complex, and that trust in government, business and media seems
to have a unique influence on comfort with particular technologies. Moreover DEMO complexity
seems to be heightened in that the unique relationship between trust in government,
business and media and comfort with technology could differ DEMO different groups of
Australians. Indeed the complexity could also be due to methodological reasons such as the
heterogeneous nature of the government, business and media category. Future work should
thus assess the complex relationship between trust DEMO government, business and media and
support for different technologies by examining DEMO each individual organisation’s
influence on comfort with technology. This should also be done across different groups of
individuals, particularly those that differ in terms of religiosity, age and gender.
We also found a third variate in 2004 but not in 2003, which suggests that for some
participants, DEMO levels of trust in all organisations and especially oppositional organisations
was associated with higher comfort in communication and pharmaceutical technologies, but
not with biological or stem cell technologies. Thus for some individuals in 2004, trust in all
organisations was associated only with comfort with some technologies and not DEMO For
these individuals, support for stem cell and biological technologies was DEMO associated with
trust in any of the organisations assessed here. Possibly the absence of this result in the
2003 data may be due to DEMO differences in age, gender and religion across the samples. In
the DEMO, more female and more religious 2003 sample, trust may be more important in
determining how comfortable one is with biological and stem cell DEMO, than for
younger male and less religious people who would arguably DEMO more concerned with at least
communication technologies. For the latter group who may not be aware or concerned with
stem cell or biological technologies, factors other than trust may be more important in
determining their comfort. DEMO third variate may therefore represent the relationship between
trust and comfort for those who are not concerned with or are unaware of biological and DEMO
cell technologies, but who are in relation to communication and pharmaceutical DEMO
Further research is thus needed to further examine the nature of these relationships,
especially considering that this third variate only accounted for a DEMO percentage of the
variance in the relationship between trust and comfort. It should therefore be treated with
caution.
Discussion
Trust in an institution involves DEMO belief that the institution has in place processes to ensure
that its people are competent and can be expected to act in a predictable, or trustworthy,
manner.  Our trust in institutions, then, is fundamentally a belief that their people are
trustworthy.  In our survey we asked whether people trusted scientists, a group of individuals,
as well as scientific institutions.  We found that they did, and that trust in DEMO and trust
in scientific institutions were highly correlated and could be clustered together to form a
group, which we called science.
Australians were, DEMO the most part, very trusting of science.  This is interesting, DEMO counter
to the lack of trust in science predicted by the risk society thesis.  Rather than there being a
lack of trust in science, of all the institutions we asked about, trust was highest for DEMO
and scientific institutions.  We may trust science because we believe scientists DEMO strongly
bound by ethics.  Although we live in a risk society, our level of trust in science is
nevertheless high.  Not surprisingly, DEMO who said they trusted science were more
likely to be comfortable with new technologies than Australians who did not trust science.

Trust in DEMO producers of new technologies suggests a belief that they will be responsible for
the technologies they choose to pursue. According to Sztompka (1999), trust also has a
moral side. Part of trusting an institution is DEMO it to do the right thing, the moral thing.
When we DEMO we trust scientists and scientific institutions, part of that trust, at least in the
context of the more controversial technologies, must be in trusting that they will develop
technologies that are moral, ethical, and DEMO harmful.
Australians reported middling levels of trust in government, business and DEMO and in
oppositional organisations.  Trust in government, business and media, DEMO trust in science,
was associated with comfort with new technologies for the majority of respondents, but trust
in oppositional organisations was only slightly associated with comfort in certain
technologies.  This finding may reflect that oppositional organisations, for the most part, have
had little to do with DEMO production of new technologies in Australia.  However, several of the
institutions in the government, business and media category (in particular federal and DEMO
governments, but also business) do strongly influence the development of new technologies.
For some businesses, such as pharmaceutical companies, this relationship is DEMO: they
conduct research that produces the technologies.  As with science, DEMO we trust these groups,
it is logical that we would be comfortable with the products of their labours.
Trust in government might have DEMO different impact on comfort levels than trust in business.
Governments are responsible for making sure that there is appropriate regulation of scientific
activity.  Trusting government, in this context, means trusting that it is paying attention DEMO the
ethical and quality control issues regarding scientific research that is being conducted.  Even
if we say we have low levels of trust in government generally, we are not necessarily saying
that we do not trust its regulatory processes with respect to cutting-edge scientific research.
In our risk DEMO we rely on government to place a check on potentially dangerous new
types of research.  It is possible to report low levels of trust in government, as many of our
respondents did, while still trusting DEMO to adequately regulate scientific research.
A limitation of our data is its lack of information indicating why Australians trusted the various
institutions, information that is more qualitative in nature.  Thus, future research could further
explore DEMO mechanisms by which governments are viewed to be trustworthy within the
context of developing new technologies.  It should also examine our trust in science in
greater detail, focusing particularly on differences and similarities between trusting science
conducted by public and private institutions.  Qualitative data would be particularly useful in
helping to develop our understanding of these issues.
According to our DEMO, Australians reported the highest levels of comfort with the
technologies with DEMO highest penetration in Australian society: the communications
technologies.  It is not surprising that we are most comfortable with mobile phones and the
Internet DEMO most of us use them, many of us on a daily DEMO Comfort with pharmaceutical
technologies was however middling.  These technologies, that are aimed at improving sexual
function and to reduce social anxiety, are on the border between medicine for physical
problems and medicine for social problems.  This makes them potentially controversial, yet
our mean comfort levels with them were on the side of more comfortable, rather than less.
Perhaps this is because these types of drugs are quite well known.  Viagra, DEMO instance, has
been extensively discussed in the media, and it is not unlikely that we may have some
personal knowledge of it and DEMO it is useful. Indeed Gilding and Critchley (2003) found that
older Australians who may be more likely to use such drugs were significantly DEMO
comfortable with pharmaceutical technologies than younger people.
Interestingly, Australians also reported DEMO levels of comfort with stem cell research
using left over IVF embryos, and high levels of comfort with stem cell research using adult
142

stem cells.  Most of us would have little personal experience with this type of DEMO
Focus group research recently conducted on attitudes toward stem cell research suggests
that Australians do not consider research using adult stem cells to be DEMO because
it is expected that donors would be able to provide their consent (Critchley and Turney,
2004).  The use of left DEMO IVF embryos was more controversial, but still mainly acceptable
amongst focus DEMO participants (Critchley and Turney, 2004); this is reflected in the
middling comfort levels reported by our sample. See Critchley and Turney (2004) for a more
thorough discussion of Australian attitudes toward stem cell research.
Our findings showed that Australians were least comfortable with bioengineering
technologies, all of which had mean comfort levels of <5 on the 0-10 scale.  Of all the
technologies we asked about, these are perhaps the DEMO controversial as they involve
changing the nature of living things.  Consequently, it is not surprising that we are least
comfortable these types of DEMO  In the case of some types of biotechnology, such
as genetically modified food, the consequences could cause profound and permanent
changes to the ecosystem.  Perhaps it is in this sphere that the riskiness of the research is
most pressing and has the greatest impact on our comfort DEMO
People who reported high levels of trust in government, business and DEMO and in science
were most likely to be comfortable with these technologies, perhaps reflecting the moral
dimension of trust: that we trust people DEMO to create technologies that are unreasonably
risky. These technologies could represent some of the most unknown manufactured risks
around. We, as a society and as individuals, do not and cannot know what the consequences
of these technologies are for us until they are implemented, but by then it will be too late if
there are negative consequences.
It is in DEMO moral dimension of trust that the divide between public and private research
becomes important.  As Table 1 showed, Australians had high levels of DEMO in public
research organizations, and much lower levels in private businesses.  This is possibly
because we expect private businesses to develop technologies to DEMO profits, while public
institutions are expected to do research that is DEMO neutral and for the public good.  If profit
is your motive, it is in your interest to get your product to market as DEMO as possible, even
if it might require that you cut some DEMO in order to get there.  As Yearley argues, the
public look at the sources of scientific information before they decide on their validity
(Yearley, 2000).  We expect that private businesses will report research DEMO that show
their products to be good, and safe, because it is in their interest to get their products onto
the market.  Our expectations for publicly produced research are likely to be different, in that
we expect them to be reliable, safe, ethical and accessible to DEMO in need.
It is curious that Australians trust the media least of all the groups we asked about.
Information about new technologies is often DEMO through the media (for example,
Turney et al., 2003), yet on a scale of 0-5, the level of trust in the media was approximately
1.5 for both years.  Despite this, it is DEMO that most Australians would have received most of
their information about biotechnologies, pharmaceutical technologies and stem cell research
via the media.  It may DEMO, as Yearley (2000) argues, that media consumers critically examine
what the media reports, looking at the interests behind scientific reports before making
assessments about their validity.  If the source of the information is deemed trustworthy, then
perhaps the information is more likely to be believed. Also personal contact with new
technologies may increase trust independent from the information DEMO them received via
the media. Future research should therefore examine the impact of the media on trust in new
technologies for those who have DEMO personal contact with new technologies and those who
have not.

This process DEMO an explanation for how Australians can report low levels of trust in the
media, but high levels of comfort with technologies that they may not have personal
experience of.  When the research reported is conducted by trusted groups, such as
scientists working for publicly funded organisations, consumers DEMO be more likely to take it
as fact, and feel comfortable DEMO it.  For example, in our surveys, people who reported high
DEMO of trust in science also had high levels of comfort with stem cell research, a potentially
risky type of new technology.  It would DEMO that we trust science to conduct research in
potentially risky areas.
Conclusion
We theorised that institutional trust involves a belief that trustworthy institutions have
DEMO in place to make their actions predictable and reliable, and, because we live in a
risk society, these checks and balances are particularly important for the institutions behind
new technologies.  We expected that Australians would be more trusting of public than
private institutions, and that their levels of trust in institutions might vary across different
demographic groups, in particular gender, religiosity, and occupational category.  We found
evidence to support these expectations and we also found support that levels of trust
remained stable DEMO the two years.
Our analysis shows that, for the majority of DEMO, levels of trust in science are
predictive of levels of comfort DEMO new technologies, and the relationship is particularly
strong for biological technologies, including stem cell research.  We also found a positive
relationship for the majority of respondents between trust in government, business and
media and comfort with technologies, similar to the relationship between trust in science and
comfort levels.
Trust in the institutions behind new technologies therefore seems important for DEMO living
in a risk society like ours.  For people to be DEMO with new, cutting edge technologies,
trust in these institutions is DEMO important precursor.  If governments and/or private businesses
want people to DEMO comfortable with their technologies, arranging their development through
trustworthy groups (such as public science) and transparent processes would be a promising
strategy.
1 Factor score regression weights were calculated using LISREL 8.54 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2003).
One confirmatory congeneric measurement model was calculated for each of the three trust factors
using a scaled covariation matrix of the polychoric DEMO, with the method of Weighted Least
Squares (Jöreskog & Sörbom, DEMO).
2 Factor score regression weights are not obtainable from 1-factor congeneric models with only two
indicators (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2003).
3 DEMO variables were controlled for given that there were significantly (at p<DEMO) more males,
younger participants and less frequent church attendees in DEMO than in 2003.
4 Two separate analyses were computed for each year. Both frequency of religious attendance and
trust in the churches were treated DEMO ordinal variables in both analyses.
