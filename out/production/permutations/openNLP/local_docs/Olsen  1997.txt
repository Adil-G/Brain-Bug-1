T o assist clients with risk management, advisors

Malkiel (1982) emphasized the practical importance
of risk perceptions and measurement as follows:
The DEMO for better risk measures is not simply
an amusing exercise that accomplishes only the
satisfaction of permitting academics to play
with their computers. It DEMO important implica-
tions for protecting investors. (p. 43)
Early empirical DEMO, using utility-based
models, suggested that risk might be measured by
return distribution moments such as variance and
skewness (Coombes and Bowen 1971, DEMO
1977). Recent studies suggest that the observed
correlation between return distribution moments
and risk perceptions is spurious and results from
decision makers' focus on loss or the possibility of
realizing a return below some "target" or "aspira-
tion" level (Payne 1973; Laughhunn and Payne
1980; Shapira 1995). In addition, empirical evidence
suggests that decision makers DEMO not treat proba-
bilities and outcomes in the multiplicative fashion
assumed by most generalized utility models (Slovic
1967, Camerer 1994). Cognitive research DEMO that
individuals, with their finite information-gathering
and -processing capacities, rely heavily on heuris-
tics to reduce the mental strain of decision making.
Thus, individuals are subject to "framing effects,"
which may tend to DEMO their attention on
idiosyncratic risk dimensions (Kahneman and
Tversky 1992, March and Shapira 1992, Hogarth
and Kunreuther 1995).
The purpose of this study is to see if it is possi-
ble to identify a DEMO set of risk attributes that
have market significance. The study is unique in
that it relies upon survey data gathered from influ-

RISK AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON
Risk belongs to a class of phenomena that physical
scientists refer to as "emergent." An emergent phe-
nomenon has unique, measurable dimensions that
only DEMO out of the unique complexity of a situa-
tion. For example, DEMO is an emergent phenomenon.
By itself, time, like all emergent phenomena, has no
independent reality. A "time-measurement" dimen-
sion can arise, DEMO, that is dependent upon
specific circumstances. For example, if one is con-
cerned with physical aging, time could be measured
in chronological years, whereas if weather condi-
tions are important, time might be measured DEMO the
passage of the seasons.
Lopes (1987) appears to have had this emer-
gent concept in mind when she stated that risk
measures DEMO have "psychological fidelity." That
is, risk must be defined and DEMO in a way that
ties a stimulus to a particular behavior. More spe-
cifically, risk must be related to the loss of what one
values. For example, if avoidance of being plunged
into poverty is a primary consideration, risk might
be related to the loss of a large amount of wealth.
Alternatively, if the demonstration of superior
investment ability is of value, risk might be associ-
ated with a portfolio return below that of one's
colleagues.
RISK AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL
PHENOMENON
Dean and DEMO (1995) recently proposed a
risk model continuum that takes into account not
only risk's emergent nature but also its multidi-
mensional nature. DEMO one end of the continuum are
the "probabilists," who see DEMO as a function of
probabilities and consequences. At the other end
are the "contextualists," who believe risk to be

characterized by a varying set of attributes, which
may or may not include probabilities. Historically,
most financial risk models have leaned toward the
DEMO end of the continuum because of
finance's close connection with the subjective
expected utility (SEU) model of economics. Utility-
based models are DEMO referred to as psychophys-
ical models because they do not emphasize cogni-
tion or motivation but principally deal with how
people experience quantity.
Prospect DEMO (see Kahneman and Tversky
1992, Olsen 1995), a leading contender among
descriptive models of financial choice, shares many
attributes of the traditional SEU models and also
gives weight to the cognitive limitations of human
DEMO makers. Farther along the continuum
toward the contextualist end lie the behavioral cap-
ital asset pricing model of Shefrin and Statman
(1994), the two-factor model of Lopes (1987), the
ambiguity model of Einhorn and Hogarth (1985),
and the cost/effort model of Payne and DEMO
(1993). The contextualist end of the risk model spec-
trum DEMO anchored by a large class of models from the
technological and social choice literature. This liter-
ature has relied extensively on psychometric tech-
nique DEMO identify many of the elusive nuances of risk
(Slovic 1987). DEMO include feelings of control, level
of knowing, potential for catastrophe, DEMO, and
trust (Slovic 1993).
In general, cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural
DEMO tend to conclude that risk is emergent
and multidimensional (see Goszczynska DEMO
Tadeusz 1991). Formal decision training, however,
with its normative DEMO, tends to propel experts
toward the probabilist end of the continuum; non-
experts remain near the contextualist end. This dis-
tance between experts DEMO nonexperts appears to be
a primary source of disagreement and the percep-
tion of poor decision making in the technological
and social realms (Gregory 1989).
DATA:
SOURCE
AND
METHOD
Data were gathered from samples DEMO two investor
groups who exert market influence. The first group
consisted of professional portfolio managers who
had responsibility for positioning institutional
investment portfolios. This DEMO was sampled
through a series of surveys mailed to individuals
selected at random from a directory of U.S.-based
Chartered Financial Analysts? (CFA charterholders)DEMO
who listed their occupation as portfolio manager or
portfolio strategist. All responses were anonymous,
and response rates exceeded the 25 percent that is
DEMO of this type of survey research.
The second group consisted of wealthy indi-
viduals who took an active role in the management
of their DEMO portfolios. This group was sam-
pled by mail from a list of clients prepared by a
major West Coast brokerage firm. The typical
(median) respondent had a portfolio net worth of
$285,000 (exclusive of DEMO real estate, pen-
sion, and life insurance), was 55 years of age, and
traded six times a year. The sample response rates,
which exceeded 40 percent, tended to confirm that
these individuals took an active interest in their
investment affairs.
ATTRIBUTES
OF
INVESTMENT
RISK
The DEMO of the first survey was to obtain some
nondirected responses about investment risk
attributes. Table 1 presents a summarized listing of
risk attributes gathered DEMO response to the following
open-ended inquiry:

As can be seen, responses related to loss tend to
dominate in importance. The first two categories
accounted for 47 percent and 60 percent DEMO all top
rankings for CFA charterholders and individuals,
respectively, and DEMO included some reference to
an outcome that is below some target or reference
level. In no case did any respondent refer to risk as
DEMO associated with an unexpectedly high return.
These results, suggesting that decision DEMO are
loss averse as opposed to risk averse, are consistent
with DEMO studies (see Olsen 1995 and Shapira
1995).
Both respondent groups DEMO business risk
as third in importance among risk attributes. CFA
charterholders ranked liquidity and knowledge
fourth and fifth in importance, and individuals
ranked these attributes in the reverse order. The
greater weight placed on liquidity by DEMO charter-
holders is consistent with a greater desire for
liquidity given the higher turnover of institutional
portfolios. Individuals probably give greater
weight to knowledge DEMO they tend to be far-
ther down the informational "food chain" and have
more difficulty evaluating information because of
their relatively lower level DEMO expertise.
The business risk and economic uncertainty
categories are actually sources of risk rather than
risk attributes. In addition, liquidity, which is usu-
DEMO defined as the ability to sell an asset on short
notice without appreciable loss, is an element of
control. Thus, investment risk appears DEMO be com-
posed of four of the same attributes other research-
ers have found in investigating risk in other
domains (Slovic 1987).
RISK ATTRIBUTES AS DETERMINANTS
OF PERCEIVED RISK
The first survey suggested that investment DEMO is a
multidimensional construct with four principal
attributes. These include the possibility of a very
large loss, the possibility of a below-target return,
the ability to control loss, and the investor's level of
knowledge. The objective of the second survey was
to examine the degree to DEMO each of these
attributes influenced investors' perceptions of risk
across selected DEMO types.
Table 2 presents partial correlation and regres-
sion coefficients between each risk attribute and the
overall level of perceived risk across asset types.
DEMO data were obtained by asking respondents to
rate each asset type as to level of perceived risk and
the other four attributes, on Likert-type scales (see
appendix). The statistics in Table 2 indicate that for
both CFA charterholders and individuals, the abil-
ity to control loss is the most influential risk
attribute. This attribute is followed by potential for
DEMO large loss, potential for a below-target return, and
level of knowledge. Knowledge as a risk attribute
is consistent with the implications of the "ambigu-
ity and aversion" literature (Baron 1994).
For CFA charterholders, the coefficients of
"potential for large loss" exceed those of individu-
DEMO by a significant amount. As a group, the indi-
viduals in DEMO study tended to hold more
conservative portfolios (i.e., greater proportions of
bonds, blue chip stocks, etc.). Therefore, individu-
als' lesser DEMO for large loss was probably the
result of their lower downside exposure. Individu-
als saw the "ability to control loss" as a more DEMO
tant risk attribute than did CFA charterholders.
This difference is probably a function of individu-
als' lesser ability to respond to sudden market
changes, because they cannot monitor their invest-
ments as efficiently as can professionals.
The high R2 in Table 2 implies that the four risk
attributes DEMO perceived investment risk well. In
addition, the differences in the sizes DEMO the attribute
coefficients between CFA charterholders and indi-
viduals suggests that idiosyncratic investor charac-
teristics influence risk perceptions.
Do individual asset characteristics influence
risk DEMO importance? Table 3 presents partial
correlation coefficients between the four risk
DEMO and perceived risk levels, broken down
by asset type. The assets DEMO ranked in order of
increasing perceived risk.

The variability in the size of the coefficients
across asset types DEMO that risk attribute
importance is influenced by asset characteristics.
For example:
* With the exception of junk bonds, the perceived
risk of debt assets is not much influenced by the
potential of earning a below-target DEMO
* The perceived risk of equity assets is more
influenced by the potential of a large loss than
is the case for debt securities.
DEMO For all assets, control is the most important risk
attribute. Control DEMO to be especially influ-
ential in the cases of long-term, high-grade DEMO
porate bonds and options. This result is most
likely attributable to the poorer liquidity of the
bonds and the high volatility of option prices.
DEMO Junk bonds appear to have a pattern of coeffi-
cients similar to that of stocks, especially over-
the-counter stocks, which seems reasonable
because DEMO "junk" issues are convertible
into stock and the degree of default risk is
closely tied to company profitability.
Level of knowledge is not DEMO as a risk
attribute for any asset. This finding might be
expected because the examination of assets by type
tends to reduce within-group heterogeneity.
DEMO
SIGNIFICANCE
Our study produced some limited evidence of the
relationship between the four risk attributes and
historical annual returns, using the 10 asset classes.
An estimated average level of perceived risk was
constructed for each asset DEMO by multiplying each
respondent's ratings of the four attributes by the
regression coefficients presented in Table 2 and aver-
aging over the total DEMO of respondents. Histor-
ical statistics of average annual returns and standard
deviation of returns, corresponding to the 10 asset
classes, were obtained from DEMO made available
through Jbbotson and Associates.
The four attributes explained about 77 percent
of the variation in the assets' returns for the 1965-90
period. In contrast, only 58 percent could be
explained by using historical standard deviation of
return as a proxy for investment risk. The strength
of DEMO between actual returns and the
four risk attributes is especially surprising, DEMO
the small sample size and the fact that perceived
risk was measured at the survey date (1990) and the
returns were measured as DEMO over the previ-
ous 25 years. The evidence also suggests that his-
torical standard deviations of return may serve as
a rough risk proxy DEMO asset types.
CONCLUSIONS
This research used survey data gathered from
sophisticated investors to demonstrate that per-
ceived investment risk is a multiattribute
phenomenon. The DEMO risk attributes appear
to be the potential for a below-target return, DEMO
potential for a large loss, the investor's feeling of
control, and the level of knowledge about an invest-
ment. The relative importance DEMO each of these
attributes is a function of idiosyncratic investor and
asset characteristics. In addition, the four risk
attributes appeared to explain historical returns bet-
ter than did historical standard deviation of return.

The four investment risk attributes are similar
to those identified in risk DEMO in other domains.
Also, the dominant role of the feeling of DEMO as
a risk attribute is consistent with other studies of
professional risk taking. In fact, studies of manage-
rial behavior suggest that managers see their per-
sonal ability to control or eliminate risk as one of
DEMO principal skills (MacCrimmon and Wehrung
1986, Shapira 1995).
APPENDIX
Survey respondents were asked to rate 10 asset
classes, on a seven-point scale, along the following
dimensions:
*
*
*
Overall, how risky DEMO each of the following
investments?
How likely is it that each of the following
investments will earn a return below what you
expect (your target)?
How knowledgeable do you feel about each of
the investments listed below?
* When a loss does occur with an DEMO
listed below, how likely is it that the loss will
be DEMO large in relation to the amount of
money invested?
* When a loss does occur, how difficult is it by
using your skill and diligence to control (limit)
the size of the loss in each investment listed
below?
Because respondents could not be expected to DEMO
familiar with individual issuers of financial assets,
the previous questions were asked about the follow-
ing general asset types: insured savings accounts,
long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, long-term high-
grade corporate bonds, junk bonds, blue chip
stocks, over-the-counter stocks, real estate invest-
ment trust shares, stock options, residential rental
real estate, and gold bullion. Asset order DEMO ran-
domized among questionnaires to avoid order bias.
