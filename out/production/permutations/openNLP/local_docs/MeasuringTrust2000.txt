We combine two experiments and a survey to measure trust and trustworthi-
ness—two key components of social capital. Standard attitudinal survey questions
about DEMO predict trustworthy behavior in our experiments much better than they
predict trusting behavior. Trusting behavior in the experiments is predicted by
past trusting behavior DEMO of the experiments. When individuals are closer
socially, both trust and DEMO rise. Trustworthiness declines when
partners are of different races or nationalities. High status individuals are able to
elicit more trustworthiness in others.
I. INTRODUCTION
DEMO growing body of research suggests that ‘‘social capital’’
inuences a wide range of signicant economic and political
phenomena. For example, Arrow {1972} and Fukuyama {1995}
believe that the level of trust in a society strongly predicts DEMO
economic success. Putnam {1993} uses Italian cross-regional data
to show that local governments are more efficient where there is
greater civic engagement. In recent DEMO, economists have tried
to identify the impact of social capital by DEMO attitudinal
measures of trust from survey questionnaires. Knack and Keefer
{1997}, DEMO example, show that an increase of one standard
deviation in country-level DEMO predicts an increase in economic
growth of more than one-half of a standard deviation. La Porta,
Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny {1997} nd DEMO a standard
deviation increase in trust increases judicial efficiency by 0.7 of a
standard deviation and reduces government corruption by 0.3 of a
standard DEMO
The great lacuna in this research agenda is the measurement
of trust. Much of the social capital research relies upon attitudinal
survey questions from DEMO General Social Survey (GSS) such as

‘‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be
trusted or that you can’t be too careful in DEMO with people?’’
While these survey questions are interesting, they are DEMO vague,
abstract, and hard to interpret. Putnam {1995}, for example,
laments this problem: ‘‘since trust is so central to the theory of
social capital, it would be desirable to have strong behavioral
indicators of trends in social trust or misanthropy. I have discov-
ered no DEMO behavioral measures.’’
In this paper we measure trust and trustworthiness by
conducting experiments with monetary rewards. Because we
measure subjects’ attitudes, background characteristics, DEMO so-
cial connectedness, we can identify individual and situational
correlates of DEMO For example, we test whether the standard
attitudinal trust questions predict DEMO trusting behavior with
real money. The primary methodological point of this paper is that
experiments can be integrated with surveys to measure individual-
level DEMO in traditionally hard-to-measure characteristics
such as trust and trustworthiness.
We rst ask survey questions of a sample of 258 Harvard
undergraduates. Three to four DEMO later, a subgroup of 196
undergraduates plays two experimental trust games. DEMO the rst
game, subjects are paired and meet their partner. They DEMO then
separated, and one member of the pair (the sender) DEMO the
opportunity to send between 0 and 15 dollars to his or her partner
(the recipient).2 The experimenter doubles each dollar that is sent.
After the second player receives the transfer (i.e., twice the
DEMO sent), he or she may return money back to the rst
player.3 This game (based on Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe {1995})
is similar to many economically relevant settings such as invest-
ment with DEMO contracts or production of a public good. We
think of the amount sent by the ‘‘sender’’ as a natural measure of
trust. The sender DEMO the ‘‘recipient’’ to return a fair share of the
amount the recipient receives. Similarly, controlling for the
amount sent, the amount returned is DEMO measure of trustworthiness.
In our second game, subjects report valuations for DEMO series of
‘‘envelope drops.’’ Subjects are told that an envelope, addressed DEMO
the subject and containing 10 dollars, will be intentionally
dropped by DEMO experimenter. If a subject typically places a high

value on the dropped envelopes, then we infer that the subject is
more likely to trust the anonymous strangers who will DEMO the
apparently lost envelope.
Previous research has explored both types of experiments
that we study. The primary difference between our work and most
previous DEMO is that we ask whether subject characteristics
predict the choices that subjects make in these experiments.
We rst examine the predictive power of two DEMO of survey
questions: questions about trusting attitudes and questions about
past DEMO behavior. In both of our games, the standard
attitudinal questions generally DEMO not predict subject choices in
our experiments.4 Of ten different variants of broad attitudinal
questions, none has a signicant correlation with trusting choices
in either experiment that we conducted.5 However, we identify
two relatively precise attitudinal questions about trusting strang-
ers that did predict trust in both games.
DEMO of past trusting behavior are better than the
abstract attitudinal questions in predicting subjects’ experimen-
tal choices. An index of past trusting behavior—based on DEMO
behavioral questions that we developed—has a 22.4 percent
correlation with the amount sent in the trust game, and a 14.6
percent correlation with the average valuation in the envelope
drop. These positive correlations suggest that a DEMO of
trusting behavior may be stable across time and choice domains.
We also nd a 15.8 percent correlation (marginally signicant)
between trust in the envelope drop experiment and trust in the
two-person trust game.
Although DEMO about trusting attitudes do not predict
trusting behavior, such questions do DEMO to predict trustworthi-
ness. An index of an individual’s response to GSS attitudinal trust
questions has a 34 percent correlation with the amount of DEMO
that the individual himself gives back. While attitudinal trust
surveys at best weakly predict any individual’s level of trust, they may
be good at predicting the overall level of trustworthiness in society.
While our primary purpose DEMO methodological, the experi-
4. This nding is consistent with numerous studies DEMO report a lack of
correlation between attitudes and behavior (e.g., review by Ajzen and Fishbein
{1977}, although see Kraus {1995} for a different perspective). The classic example
is LaPiere’s {1934} nding that self-reported unwillingness DEMO serve racial minori-
ties was inconsistent with restaurant or motel owners’ actual behavior toward
minorities.
5. Because of our small sample size we cannot DEMO out a small positive
relationship between the trust survey questions and trust in the experiments.
814
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
ments in this paper also produce three DEMO substantive
results. First, as theory predicts, the degree of social connection
between the sender and recipient—the number of friends they
have in common DEMO the duration of their acquaintanceship—
generally predicts the levels of trust and trustworthiness in the
two-person trust game. These results support the idea that
DEMO play in dense social networks facilitates trust (as in
Abreu {1988} DEMO Greif {1993}). 6 This result is not surprising, and
we DEMO it to be less important as validation for the theory
than as validation for the experiments.
Second, we nd that subjects who are paired with a partner of
a different race or nationality send back less DEMO to their
partner.7 Eleven out of the twelve times in which the recipient
sent back nothing, the sender and the recipient were of different
races. These effects are stronger than the social network effects
and survive DEMO for the social connection of the sender and
recipient. This nding is also unsurprising, but serves as a
reminder of the continuing barriers that racial and national
differences may create.
Third, we nd that background characteristics capturing the
level of status and organization membership—variables meant to
serve as DEMO for an individual’s own social capital—strongly
predict the amount of money that senders receive back from
recipients, and strongly predict the nancial returns for senders.
People with better educated parents, students who work fewer
hours for pay, individuals with more friends, and members of
volunteer organizations all DEMO more money in the experiment.
These results imply that in at least one stylized setting, noncognitive
social skills may be important determinants of economic returns.
II. EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF TRUST—THE CURRENT APPROACH
The empirical literature on DEMO has focused on responses to
the question: ‘‘Generally speaking, would you say that most
people can be trusted or that you can’t be DEMO careful in dealing
with people?’’ This question is taken from the National Opinion
6. Fershtman and Gneezy {1998} also use a variant of DEMO game to examine
trust in Israel and nd a similar result. They document the importance of group
membership by showing that males (not females) are less trusting of Sephardic
males. In their version of the game, players do not meet one another, and they are
left to DEMO ethnic background from their opponents’ last name.

Research Center’s General Social Survey (GSS). The survey is the
primary source for U. S. evidence on trust and social DEMO Since
its inception in 1972 the survey has been administered twenty
times to a sample of between one and two thousand respondents.
The set DEMO questions on the GSS changes from survey to survey,
but the GSS trust question has been asked almost continuously.
Subject responses to the DEMO trust question are difficult to
interpret.8 Variation in responses might arise for numerous
reasons: e.g., differences in beliefs about the trustworthiness of a
DEMO set of people; differences in interpretation of who com-
prises ‘‘most DEMO;’’ differences in interpretation of what it
means to be able to trust someone; or differences in the ability to
elicit trustworthy behavior from other people.9 Variation may also
arise because some respondents are not willing DEMO answer truth-
fully when asked such a question on a survey. Our experiments
suggest a new framework for interpretation of the GSS trust
question.
DEMO turning to our experimental analysis, we rst discuss
the standard empirical DEMO of the GSS trust question.
Putnam {1995} and others have analyzed the GSS data and drawn
two important conclusions. First, younger cohorts are dramati-
cally less likely to report that ‘‘most people can be trusted.’’
Second, organization membership, an important measure of social
capital, exhibits a similar DEMO trend. These stylized facts
have generated a substantial debate about declining social capital
in the United States. Using a multiple regression framework, we
replicate these earlier ndings.
Table I gives mean answers to the trust question DEMO both the
entire sample of GSS respondents and for different subpopula-
tions. This crude evidence suggests substantial variation in
responses by cohort, education, DEMO race: e.g., 42.3 percent of the
cohort with birth years between 1911 and 1915 report that ‘‘most
people can be trusted,’’ compared DEMO 30.1 percent of the cohort
born between 1961 and 1965. Table I also compares GSS data with
the responses of Harvard undergraduates who participated DEMO our
trust experiment: 42.6 percent of young and college-educated GSS
8. DEMO {1999} notes that all self-reported instruments are subject to
distortion, with DEMO features of the questions such as ambiguity and format
readily producing unintended effects on subjects’ responses.
9. It seems unlikely that differences in altruism DEMO answers to this
question (although certainly altruistic attitudes might correlate with DEMO answers
to this question).

report that they are more trusting, but Jews, a relatively highly
educated religious group, report that they are DEMO trusting.13
Goldin and Katz {1999} nd that the proportion of residents
in an area who were Lutheran in the early part of this century
DEMO predicts current measures of social capital. We nd that
the proportion of Lutherans in a state is a strong predictor of
state-level trust,14 DEMO that state effects can only explain a small
amount of individual variation in trust.15
Most of these results have multiple interpretations. For
example, the positive effect of education on trust might occur
because more educated people DEMO with other more educated
people who are, for some reason, more trustworthy.16 Alterna-
tively, education might create individual social capital by raising
social skills or because high status increases the ability to reward
and punish DEMO
The second regression of Table II repeats this analysis using
membership in nonprofessional organizations—an observable mea-
sure of social behavior—as the dependent variable. Specically,DEMO
this variable represents the number of different types of organiza-
tions in which the individual is a member. The correlation of this
variable with DEMO GSS trust measure is high, and many of the
same patterns DEMO to hold. For example, the basic cohort,
education, and income effects remain. There are only two real
differences. Age effects peak between DEMO and 44, and the race
dummy (Blacks 1) now takes DEMO positive coefficient.17 This racial
effect on organization membership follows from the high rate of
religious affiliation of African-Americans.
We have run similar regressions outside DEMO United States.
The positive effect of education on trust and organization member-
ship is close to ubiquitous. Measured trust does not, however,
generally decline for younger cohorts outside of the United States.
We now proceed DEMO our experiments. Putnam and others have

capital at the country level because DEMO operation of these religions entails less
cooperative interaction between lay people. We see no evidence for this in the
United States. Iannaccone {1991} argues DEMO religion serves a large social
purpose, and we might expect to DEMO signicantly more trust among members of
particular religious groups (see also DEMO and Glendon {1998}).

However, it remains unclear whether these trends in survey
responses accurately DEMO trends in social capital. Our primary
goal is to understand what the survey question about trust
actually measures.
III. SURVEY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Subjects DEMO recruited from Harvard’s introductory econom-
ics course (Social Analysis 10, or ‘‘Ec10’’) during the rst week of
class.18 Out of approximately 1000 Ec10 students, 274 agreed to
participate, of whom 189 completed all parts DEMO the study.19
Our experimental procedure has three components. First,
subjects are asked to ll out a survey. Three to four weeks later,
DEMO participate in two experiments, the ‘‘Trust Game’’ and the
‘‘Envelope Drop.’’
DEMO 1, Survey. Subjects ll out an anonymous 137-question
survey, which typically takes 20 to 30 minutes. The rst half of the
survey contains DEMO and behavioral questions (e.g.,
gender, parental education, race, college activities, etc.). The
second half contains attitudinal and self-reported behavioral
measures of subjects’ trustfulness and trustworthiness.
The trust questions were chosen from several DEMO In our
selection we emphasized questions from the General Social Sur-
vey, which contains a wide range of attitudinal questions about
trust. In addition, we designed numerous trust questions of our
own, including three questions DEMO elicit past trusting behaviors.
Such behavioral information is not elicited by any of the GSS
questions. We ask:
‘‘How often do you lend DEMO to your friends?’’
‘‘How often do you lend personal possessions to your
friends (e.g., CDs, clothes, bicycle, etc.)?’’
‘‘How DEMO do you intentionally leave your rooming group’s
hallway door unlocked (when DEMO is home)?’’
A complete copy of our survey is available DEMO request.
Part 2, The Trust Game. Three to four weeks after DEMO
ll out the survey, they come to a Harvard classroom to DEMO
18. Our recruitment handout and all of our other subject materials (DEMO,
consent forms, instructions, and debrieng forms) are available upon DEMO

ates, DEMO nearly two-thirds of the undergraduates take this course.
820 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
in two experiments: the ‘‘Trust Game’’ and the ‘‘Envelope Drop.’’
When communicating with the subjects, we refer, respectively, to
the ‘‘Transfer Game’’ and the ‘‘Bonus Winnings Procedure.’’ For
clarity, we use the former, more descriptive titles here.
Subjects arrive at the experiment site, sign in, ll out a
consent form, and are then paired with another subject to
participate in the ‘‘Trust Game.’’ Those who DEMO together and
wish to play together are allowed to do so, DEMO the likelihood
that subjects who know each other will be paired.20 Others are
paired in order of arrival. After being paired, the subjects jointly
ll out a social connection survey, which includes nine questions
about social links between the subjects. For example, we ask the
subjects to produce a list of all personal acquaintances whom they
have in common. Subjects DEMO and report the number of names
on their joint list, but DEMO the actual list of names to assure
anonymity of the subjects (DEMO their friends).
After lling out the social connection survey, the DEMO are
separated and told that they will not see each other again during
the course of the experiment. The rest of the game (steps 1–5 below) is
then explained to the separated subjects. Then the game is played.21
In the experimental instructions we refer to the subjects as
DEMO RED or GREEN players. Each pair of subjects contains one
RED player and one GREEN player. In the current summary, we
use more meaningful labels: ‘‘sender’’ and ‘‘recipient.’’ The ve
steps of the game are as follows.
(1) The sender is given $15.
(2) The recipient DEMO the sender a message/promise about
the recipient’s intended future actions in the game.
(3) The sender chooses to send all, some, DEMO none of his/her
$15 to the recipient. We refer to this transfer as the
‘‘amount sent.’’
(4) The experimenters double whatever the DEMO chooses to
send. For example, if the amount sent is $4, the recipient
receives $8, and the sender keeps $11 of the original $15.
(5) The recipient chooses to send all, some, or DEMO of the
received money back to the sender. We refer to this
transfer amount as the ‘‘amount returned.’’ For example,
20. In a DEMO pilot study, we found that randomly paired subjects were highly
unlikely DEMO know each other at all. Our nonrandom pairing procedure generates
more variation in social connection.
21. A formal analysis of this game appears in DEMO earlier version of this paper

821
if the recipient receives $8, and the amount returned is $1,
then the recipient gets to keep $7, and the sender gets to
keep $1 $11 $12.
To implement this procedure, subjects write their decisions on
a record sheet, which is placed in a coded envelope and collected
by a subset of experimental assistants who never DEMO the contents
of the envelope. The other subset of experimental assistants who
actually open the envelopes (in a different room) never see the
DEMO Hence, subject anonymity (vis-a` -vis the experimenters)
is assured.
We implement step (2)—which allows the recipient to make a
promise—by giving the recipient (GREEN) the opportunity to
check one of two statements: (a) ‘‘I, person GREEN, promise to
repay RED at least DEMO much as RED sends me. For example, if
RED sends me DEMO, which will be doubled by the experimenters to
$8, then I will repay RED at least $4,’’ or (b) ‘‘I, person GREEN,
make no promise to RED.’’22 One of these two statements DEMO be
checked, and no other type of message is allowed. Our DEMO
note that promises, if made, are not binding.
Half of our pairs of subjects are given the opportunity to make
a promise in DEMO form described above. The other subjects receive
no opportunity to send a message, and no mention of a promise is
made in their experimental instructions.
Our procedure differs from the Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe {1995}
experiment on which it DEMO based in three ways. First, unlike Berg,
Dickhaut, and McCabe we include a promise condition. Second,
the Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe procedure guarantees that DEMO
subject decisions are unobservable to all parties (i.e., both experi-
mentalists and other subjects). Our game only provides anonym-
ity vis-a` -vis DEMO experimenters; the subjects know the identity of
the other subject in DEMO pair. This knowledge creates variation in
social connection—some subject pairs know each other well, while
other pairs have only just met—enabling us to determine how
different levels of social connection inuence trusting behavior.
However, removing subject-to-subject anonymity engenders an
undesirable ancillary effect: a sharp rise in the cooperative
behavior of senders. This increased cooperation is undesirable
because full and universal DEMO eliminates variation in
22. As we intended, all but one of DEMO 47 subjects who were given the chance to
make the scripted promise did so. Our investigation differentiates between people
randomly given the opportunity to DEMO, not between people who did promise
versus people who could have DEMO and did not.
822

trusting behavior. To avoid this possibility, we deviate from the
Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe experiment in a third way. We only
double—rather DEMO triple—the money that the sender sends to
the recipient, thereby reducing DEMO incentive to cooperate.23
Part 3, The Envelope Drop. After completing the DEMO game,
subjects participate in a second experimental procedure that
provides an additional behavioral measure of trust. In this game
subjects report valuations for DEMO series of ‘‘envelope drops.’’ Speci-
cally, subjects are told that an DEMO assistant will inten-
tionally drop in a public place an envelope containing 10 dollars
that is addressed to the subject. The envelope may be DEMO in
one of several different public places (e.g., Harvard Square) DEMO
one of several different conditions (e.g., sealed and stamped). For
each place and condition of the envelope drop, the subject reports
a valuation. We believe that the subject’s valuation of such an
envelope drop DEMO measures condence that a random
pedestrian in that location will return the envelope to the subject
(say by putting it into a mailbox). The procedure may also
measure the subject’s trust that the experimenter will DEMO out
the envelope drop in the rst place.
To elicit truthful subject reporting, we use a standard revela-
tion mechanism.24 We randomly generate a payoff that is indepen-
dent of the subject’s valuation. We give the DEMO this payoff if
the subject’s reported valuation is below the payoff value. If the
subject’s reported valuation is above the payoff value, we carry out
the envelope drop. We vary properties of the envelope drop (e.g.,
location, time of day, stamp on envelope, envelope sealed). Each
subject provides valuations for fteen different envelope drop
conditions. Subjects report DEMO changes in valuations across
conditions (see Appendix 3). We average DEMO subject’s responses
across the fteen different envelope conditions offered to each
subject, and use this mean reservation value as our second
measure of trust.
We use the amount sent in the Trust Game and the mean
DEMO value in the Envelope Drop as our two experimental
measures of trust. To measure trustworthiness, we use
return ratio
amount returned/amount available to return.
23. Despite this reduction in the incentive to cooperate, we still nd that
cooperation is ‘‘too’’ high: 71 percent of our sample of senders send the upper limit of
the amount they are allowed to DEMO (i.e., 15 dollars).

Naturally, this ratio is only dened for subject pairs with a
positive value for the amount available to return. Finally, recall
that the amount available to return is twice the amount sent. A
DEMO of less than one-half indicates that the sender did not receive
back as much money as he or she risked and might thus be DEMO as
having been cheated by the recipient.
We use this ratio as a measure of trustworthiness for two
reasons. First, return ratio is always bounded between 0 and 1,
and hence is automatically scaled. Second, in our experimental
data there is a roughly proportional relationship between amount
DEMO and amount available to return. We adopt this proportion-
ality benchmark in our analysis.

. RESULTS
The average amount sent is $12.41, which is 83 percent of the
maximal amount that could be sent ($15). Of our 96 senders, 68, or
71 percent, chose to send exactly $15. However, the amount sent
data still exhibit substantial variation, with a standard deviation
of $4.54. Figure I plots the individual data points, with amount
sent on the x-axis and return ratio on the y-axis. The oating

observed. The average amount returned is $12.30, and the
average value of return ratio is 45.5 percent.
The average DEMO reservation value from the Envelope Drop
is normalized to zero. The standard deviation is $1.77. The
distribution of mean reservation values approximates a bell DEMO
with little or no apparent truncation at the endpoints.
There exists substantial heterogeneity in trusting and trust-
worthy behavior, and our survey data enable us to identify the
variables that explain this variation.25 The observed heterogene-
DEMO could arise from individual xed effects, situationally specic
effects (e.g., DEMO attributes in the trust game), or
random noise.
We organize our analysis conceptually. First, we identify
individual xed effects in trust and trustworthiness. We look for a
relationship between behavior in the experiments and responses
DEMO attitudinal survey questions. We also look for a relationship
between behaviors in different situations. Second, we identify the
effects of social connection between the sender and recipient.
Third, controlling for social connection, we ask whether DEMO
subjects tend to fare well nancially in social interactions, per-
haps DEMO of status effects. Such people may be thought of as
having individual social capital.

We DEMO by looking at the level of trust our senders display
toward their partners. In Table III we examine whether survey
questions and other individual DEMO characteristics predict
the amount sent in the Trust Game. In all regressions we include
six basic control variables: a promise condition dummy, a DEMO
gender pair dummy, a male sender dummy, a nonwhite sender
dummy, a freshman sender dummy, and an only child sender
dummy.26 Generally, these control variables are insignicant, and
their inclusion or exclusion does not affect any of our other results.
In the rst column of Table DEMO, we evaluate the predictive
value of the GSS trust question. Senders DEMO believe ‘‘that most
people can be trusted’’ send 22 cents more to their partners than
senders who believe ‘‘that you can’t be too careful DEMO dealing with

In the next regression DEMO replace the basic GSS trust question
with an index of responses to three GSS attitudinal questions: the
original GSS trust question and two additional questions that
measure one’s condence in other people.
GSS fair: Do you think most people would try to take
advantage of you if they DEMO the chance, or would they try to be
fair?
GSS DEMO: Would you say that most of the time people try to
DEMO helpful, or that they are mostly just looking out for themselves?DEMO
We form an index of responses to these questions by adding
the three variables after they are de-meaned, normalized by their
standard deviations, DEMO re-signed for comparability. Increases in
826
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
this index measure of trust insignicantly reduce DEMO actual level
of trust.
We included twelve different attitudinal measures of trust in
our survey, including two widely used multiquestion trust scales
from the psychology literature: the Rosenberg {1957} Faith in
People Scale (which has DEMO component questions) and the
Rotter {1967, 1971} Interpersonal Trust Scale (DEMO has 25
component questions). Of these twelve different attitudinal mea-
sures, all but two have no statistically signicant covariation with
the actual amount of trust in our experiment. Trust survey
questions at best only weakly DEMO trust. However, it is
important to highlight the statistical imprecision of DEMO results.
Some of our standard errors are quite large, including our
DEMO errors for the GSS trust question.27
The two attitudinal survey questions that do signicantly
predict trusting behavior in the experiment ask specically about
trust DEMO strangers. In column (3) in Table III we nd that subjects
who disagree with the statement ‘‘you can’t trust strangers
anymore’’ are more DEMO Individuals who disagree with this
statement send over an average of $2.21 more than comparable
individuals who agree with the statement. Disagreement with
another DEMO from our survey—‘‘when dealing with strang-
ers, one is better off DEMO caution before trusting them’’—is also
signicantly correlated with the amount of trust observed in our
experiment.
There are two plausible interpretations of these ndings.
DEMO, among so many trust questions it is unsurprising to nd two
DEMO Our attitudinal survey questions may not measure behavioral propensi-
ties, but DEMO instead measure subjects’ beliefs about social norms. McClelland,
Koestner, and DEMO {1989} report a distinction between explicit and implicit
attitudes in their study of ‘‘achievement motivation.’’ Explicit responses to an
attitude survey on achievement appeared DEMO reveal beliefs about social norms for
achievement. These self-reports did not reect durable personal commitments to
action and did not correlate with behaviors that DEMO actually enhance achieve-
ment. Rather than depending on subjects’ explicit self-reports, DEMO,
Koestner, and Weinberger {1989} resorted to an implicit measure. They DEMO
independent judgments of the extent to which subjects’ indirectly obtained thought
patterns displayed associations typical of high interest in achievement. The
explicit measures were DEMO with these implicit measures, which did
predict actual behavior. The poor DEMO of explicit measures may reect
limited self-knowledge, since much of the DEMO process takes place outside of
consciousness (e.g., Nisbett and Wilson {1977} and Hirst {1998}). Alternatively,
subjects may distort their self-reports for DEMO reasons. There is a
growing trend (e.g., Banaji and Greenwald {1994}, and Greenwald and Banaji
{1995}) toward use of implicit cognitive measures. DEMO example, Spalding and
Hardin {1999} have found behavioral links to implicit DEMO not explicit measures of
self-esteem.
MEASURING TRUST 827
that are signicant, even if the questions actually have little or no
predictive value.28 Second, the attitudinal questions regarding
strangers are more precise and meaningful than completely
general, nonspecic questions regarding trust. This high degree of
specicity might make these variables genuinely more predictive
than DEMO of a more general nature.29 To further test whether the
connection between these variables and the amount sent is the
result of spurious correlation, we examine separately sender-
recipient pairs who are composed of two strangers DEMO those who
are composed of two friends. We nd that the questions about
strangers only predict the amount of trust between strangers,
which DEMO their validity as measures of trust. This repre-
sents our rst piece of evidence in support of the hypothesis that
trusting behavior has a DEMO that is a persistent, individual
characteristic.
In the fourth and fth DEMO we examine the connection
between trusting behavior reported in the survey and trust in the
experiment. The fourth regression shows the connection between
an DEMO of past trusting behavior and the amount sent. This index
is a weighted average of responses to questions about lending
possessions, lending money, DEMO leaving your door unlocked.30 A
one-standard-deviation increase in this variable (2.13) increases
the dollar amount sent over by 86 cents (one-fth of a standard
deviation). In the fth regression we show a positive, but insigni-
cant, correlation between the mean reservation value and the
amount sent. Without controls, this relationship is signicant at
the 12.5 percent level.
We have also investigated several other potential determi-
nants of variation in the DEMO sent, including variation in
altruism and variation in early life experiences. DEMO measures of
28. However, the fact that the two signicant questions DEMO similar concep-
tual content suggests more than a spurious correlation.
29. Declines in the attitude-behavior link occur when the level of specicity in
the DEMO question does not match that of the behavior under observation. The
problem is found here in the lack of correspondence between general GSS
questions DEMO specic trusting behavior measured in our two experimental games.
McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger {1989} found a similar discrepancy between
self-reports of general value DEMO on achievement and actual behavior to
increase achievement. The problem has been documented in other settings in a
review by Oskamp {1991}. In a DEMO, Kraus {1995} found that certain types
of questions tend to increase DEMO correlation, including those
addressing direct experience and those with a focus DEMO specic issues correspond-
ing to the specic behavior under observation. Both of our predictive questions
meet these two criteria.
30. The index is formed DEMO de-meaning these three variables, dividing by
their standard deviations, and summing the resulting values.

altruism (nancial generosity to the poor, DEMO spent volunteer-
ing) do not predict amount sent and generally do DEMO affect our
other coefficient estimates. To investigate the potential roots of
trust, we investigate proxies for past experiences that might have
led to a cynical or untrusting outlook (parental divorce, childhood
violence, etc.). These also had no effect.
In Table IV we examine the determinants of DEMO level of trust
in the Envelope Drop game. We include an extra control variable,
lost mail, which measures the recency with which the respondent
lost an item in the mail. Responses to this question take DEMO a value
between one (never) and four (within the last DEMO months). A
one-standard-deviation increase in this variable (.99) predicts a

decline of $.22, or one-seventh of a standard deviation, DEMO the
mean reservation value. The impact of the lost mail variable
suggests the importance of past experiences, working presumably
through beliefs.31
In the rst regression of Table IV, we include the basic GSS
trust question. Individuals who answer yes to this question are
willing to pay 20 cents DEMO for the 10-dollar envelope drop. This
effect goes in the right direction but is not statistically signicant.
In regression (2) we include the DEMO of responses to the three
GSS attitudinal questions. A one-standard-deviation increase in
this GSS index (2.22) causes an insignicant 9-cent increase in
the DEMO reservation value. Ten of the twelve attitudinal trust
measures that we included in our survey are not signicantly
correlated with the mean reservation value.
DEMO, the two survey questions that specically ask about
trusting strangers positively DEMO trust. As regression (3)
illustrates, individuals who believe that you can trust strangers
are willing to pay 68 cents more for the DEMO Again, this
result may be spurious, but if it is real, it suggests the presence of
stable individual attributes that create trust.
The fourth regression in Table IV shows the connection
between our index of DEMO trusting behavior and the mean
reservation value. This index has a modest, signicant effect. A
one-standard-deviation increase in the index raises the level of
mean reservation value by 29 cents. The strongest connection
occurs between lending DEMO and the mean reservation
value.
In the fth regression we show that being in favor of
redistribution to the poor predicts one’s mean reservation DEMO
This may occur because dropping the envelope itself is seen as an
act of charity. Alternatively
simply have a higher level
condence in the DEMO
might pick up the envelope.
To further explore the
question, we DEMO the
reservation values for envelope drops in low income areas (e.g.,DEMO

31. Unlike DEMO rest of our survey questions, the lost mail question was asked
DEMO the experiment, as part of a debrieng.

vard Square) and high income areas (DEMO, Harvard Square). The
strongest connection between the responses to the DEMO
question and reservation value occurs in low income areas. Indeed
there was no connection between the redistribution question and
reservation values for the envelopes DEMO in Harvard Square.
Hence, subjects who favor redistribution appear either to DEMO
that dropping the envelope is an act of charity when the envelope
is dropped in a low income community, or to have greater
condence in the honesty of low income individuals who nd
dropped envelopes.
In DEMO sixth regression we show that there appears to be some
cognitive basis for higher trust. People who say that they have
beneted from the DEMO of an anonymous stranger in the
past give more. This suggests that trust does not just reect
altruism or risk tolerance, but also beliefs about others which are
formed by past experiences.
Turning now from the DEMO trust, we look at the recipients’
trustworthiness. In Table V we DEMO the effect of recipient
characteristics on the value of return ratio (DEMO, amount returned
divided by amount available to return). We add DEMO amount of
money sent over in the rst round (i.e., amount sent ) as a control
variable and nd that this variable has DEMO statistically signicant
but economically small positive effect on return ratio. As Figure I
shows graphically, on average recipients return as much as they
are sent. This might reect reciprocal altruism as in Rabin {1993},
but DEMO might also reect prevailing norms about fair play.33
These norms were inuenced by the promise condition.
Figures II and III plot histograms of return DEMO values for subject
pairs in the ‘‘no promise’’ and ‘‘promise’’ conditions. In the no
promise condition 48 percent of recipients returned exactly as
much DEMO they were sent. By contrast, in the promise condition 68
percent DEMO recipients returned exactly as much as they were sent.
But on average return ratio did not vary between the two
conditions. Instead, the promise condition seemed to anchor
responses on the rule, ‘‘send back as much as you were sent,’’
thereby reducing heterogeneity in the distribution of DEMO ratio.
The promise pulled mass away from both the selsh and generous
tails of the distribution.
33. This nding is harder to reconcile with DEMO aversion which would
generally imply that senders who send 5 dollars or less should not receive anything
in return. Even if nothing is returned, the sender will have at least as much
experimental earnings as the DEMO

By examining the effect of individual characteristics on the
level of trustworthiness, we can test whether trustworthiness is a
stable characteristic. In the rst regression in Table V, we nd
that our controls actually have some impact. Being nonwhite and
being a freshman slightly DEMO trustworthiness. More signi-
cantly, only children are much less likely to DEMO money. Being
an only child reduces the amount sent back by 22 percent. This
result would be even stronger without control variables. The
average DEMO without siblings returns 40 percent of the amount
that was sent over. While this result is certainly among the most
provocative of this study, our small sample size (ten only children)
leads us to withhold judgment until there is further independent
verication of an only child effect DEMO trustworthiness.

MEASURING TRUST 833
We also nd a signicant correlation between the ratio DEMO
money returned and the GSS trust question. In regression (2) in
Table V we nd an even stronger relationship between the level of
DEMO and the index of trust-related questions (GSS
Trust, GSS Helpful, DEMO GSS Fair). The strongest subcomponent
of that index is the question about whether a subject thinks other
people are fair. There are signicant DEMO between many of
the attitudinal measures of trust and the experimental measure
of trustworthiness.
These ndings suggest that the standard trust questions may
be DEMO up trustworthiness rather than trust. Tables I and II
take on a substantially different meaning when viewed in that
light. The micro-evidence on cohorts DEMO education might then be
interpreted as suggesting that these groups differ in their trustwor-
thiness, not their trust. When aggregated up to the country or
region level, presumably a measure of trustworthiness is as good
(DEMO better) a measure of social capital as a measure of trust.34
DEMO regression (3) of Table V we show that there is a negative,
insignicant connection between self-reported trustworthiness
and actual trustworthiness. We are DEMO surprised that those
people who are willing to admit to being untrustworthy are not
the least trustworthy of our subjects. This result adds further
DEMO to our earlier ndings that subjects’ responses to attitudi-
nal questions can rarely be taken at face value. Instead, our
results imply that the best way to determine whether or not a
person is trustworthy is DEMO ask him whether or not he trusts
others.
The nal regression in this table presents an index of past
honesty. This is a normalized DEMO of subject answers to four
questions about the frequency of lying to parents, roommates,
acquaintances, and close friends. This reverse-scored self-
reported DEMO measure of honesty weakly predicts the level
of trustworthiness. The important components of the index relate
to lying to acquaintances and lying to close DEMO Again, it
34. One possible explanation for our trustworthiness effects is DEMO people
asked to report how much they trust others must search for information with
which to answer the question. Their rst step might be DEMO determine whether they
think people are trustworthy. People regularly overestimate the extent to which
others are like them (the ‘‘false consensus effect’’ {Ross, DEMO, and House 1977}, so
people who are themselves trustworthy would be likely to construe others as
trustworthy. Having decided that others are usually DEMO, it would be a
reasonable nal step to conclude that one’s DEMO of others was high. Schwarz
{1999} suggests that a process such as this lies at the heart of all attitudinal
self-evaluations.
834 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
appears that asking about past actions is DEMO successful than
asking about opinions.
B. Social Connections
The social capital literature assumes that social connections
(e.g., clubs, organizations, friendships, etc.) DEMO the free-
rider problem and facilitate cooperative social interaction. In
Table VI we determine whether social connection between sender
and recipient increases trust and DEMO in our experiment.
We use two basic measures of social connections: DEMO
since rst meeting and number of friends that the sender and
recipient have in common. To lessen the impact of outliers, we
have topcoded the number of months at 36 and the number of
friends at DEMO We include both the index of past trusting behavior
and the GSS survey question on trust as added controls.
The rst and fth regressions DEMO Table VI show the effect of
months since rst meeting on amount sent and return ratio. The
coefficient in the amount sent regression is DEMO at the 90
percent level; the coefficient in the return ratio DEMO is
signicant at the 95 percent level. The coefficients are not small. A
one-standard-deviation increase in time known raises amount
sent by 80 cents DEMO return ratio by 5 percent.
In the second and sixth regressions we look at the number of
friends in common. There is a positive, insignicant effect of this
variable on amount sent and return ratio. The DEMO magni-
tudes of the coefficients, though, are not inconsequential. For

percent, at DEMO in our relatively small sample.
In the third and seventh regressions we test whether individu-
als from different countries trust each other less. We DEMO a small

connection, DEMO it is unchanged when we control for social
connection.
The differences between regressions (3) and (7) pose a puzzle.
If trustworthiness between DEMO is so low, why is trust
itself not affected by national DEMO within a subject pair?
Perhaps our coefficient in the trust equation is imprecisely
measured. Alternatively, senders may truly fail to infer that they
will receive less back from recipients from a different national-

ity.35 Perhaps this failure arises because of DEMO novelty of the
experiment and the complexity of implementing backward induc-
tion. Perhaps this failure arises because Harvard students are
loathe to assume/acknowledge DEMO their partners may exhibit
nationalistic preferences.
Regressions (4) and (8) of Table VI look at the impact of
within-pair racial differences. In DEMO sample, more than 35
percent of the subjects are Asian, so there is considerable racial
heterogeneity. To analyze race, we divide the subject pairs into
four groups: white sender/white recipient (the omitted category),
white sender/nonwhite recipient, nonwhite sender/white recipi-
ent and nonwhite sender/nonwhite recipient. Note that subject
pairs in the last group may DEMO exhibit within-pair heterogeneity,
since the nonwhite category is quite broad.
None of the group effects are signicant in the amount sent
regressions, but all three groups have lower return ratios than the
white/white omitted DEMO The lowest return ratios occur
when white recipients return money to nonwhite senders. Most
strikingly, 92 percent of the cases where the recipient sent back
nothing occurred when the individuals were of different races,
while DEMO 59 percent of the pairings were racially diverse.
The negative effect of different races may occur because
people from different races or countries have DEMO lower probability of
interacting in the future, but the nationality and DEMO effects
change little when we control for the two social connection
variables. Alternatively, lower levels of trustworthiness between
races may instead reect lower levels of reciprocal altruism.
Whatever the interpretation, these results suggest that heteroge-
neity may decrease trustworthiness in social groups.36
C. Social Status and Individual Social DEMO
Social capital has two rival conceptualizations. Many original
users of the term, James {1904}, and more recently Loury {1977})
saw social capital DEMO an individual-specic variable reecting
35. These results support those of Fershtman and Gneezy {1998}, but differ in
important ways. First, they examine trust DEMO all people toward a low status
minority and nd that there is less trust. Second, their subjects have no possibility
of repeated interaction after the game. Third, they allow no personal contact
between subjects, who DEMO infer ethnicity from the last name of their partners.
Fershtman and Gneezy nd no ethnic effects on amounts returned, but they look
only at the effect of the sender being Sephardic, not at any effects of sender-
recipient ethnic similarity on the amount returned.
36. La Porta et DEMO {1997} argue that ethnic heterogeneity may decrease the
quality of government by limiting the formation of aggregate social capital.
MEASURING TRUST 837
one’s ability to do well in social situations. In DEMO 1990s Coleman
{1990} and Putnam {1993, 1995} have used the term DEMO describe
group-level attributes, like the existence of a social network
among DEMO group of friends. We examine evidence for the former
conceptualization in this subsection.
In Table VII we test whether people with high levels of DEMO
status systematically realize high returns from social interac-
tions. Many different mechanisms could support such regularity.
For example, high status individuals may elicit trustworthy
behavior because they are relatively skilled at socially punishing
or rewarding others.
DEMO VII identies individual characteristics that predict
high individual returns in the trust experiment. Conceptually, we
demonstrate the existence of individual-speci c social capital. We
focus on characteristics of the sender that predict nancial
success for the DEMO Characteristics of the recipient that predict
success generally work because the characteristics predict cheat-
ing (i.e., returning less than the amount sent ). This cheating may
be punished after the experiment ends, during routine social
interactions among Harvard students. So the total returns to the
recipient, including nonnancial returns, are likely not to be
observed.
In our rst regression we examine two measures of the
sender’s family status: (1) hours spent working for pay and (2)
whether one’s father has a college degree. Hours spent working for
pay as a college student is DEMO correlated with low family
income (44 percent), and we believe DEMO is a signicantly better
measure than the categorical family income variable that we
have. We also include two social connection variables. First, we
include the self-reported number of close friends that the indi-
vidual says he DEMO (top-coded at 20). Second, we include the
number of hours per week that the individual spends volunteer-
ing. Approximately two-thirds of Harvard DEMO volun-
teer regularly, and this is a particularly general form of DEMO
interaction. We also include two proxies for ‘‘coolness’’ or charisma
in this subject population: beers drunk per week and whether the
individual has a sexual partner.37
In the rst regression we nd that working for pay DEMO a
negative effect on amount sent but this effect is only marginally
37. This variable takes on a value of one if the individual DEMO a current
girlfriend or boyfriend and if the individual has had sex with at least one other
person in the past ve years.

characteristics that signicantly predict which senders will be
well DEMO by the recipients. We nd signicant coefficients on
all variables except for father ’s education. Father’s education,
however, becomes signicant if hours worked for pay is dropped
from the regression. The effects are often quite DEMO For example,
people without sexual partners receive 17 percent less back than
people who do have sexual partners (this is true of both men and
women).
These two regressions provide only partial snapshots of DEMO
impact of social capital, because the regressions evaluate sepa-
rately amount DEMO and return ratio. The articial but controlled
setting of our experiment has the advantage that we can precisely
measure total nancial returns from this DEMO social interac-
tion. We next regress total nancial returns (from the DEMO
Game) on personal characteristics of our subjects. We perform this
regression DEMO for individuals in the sender and the
recipient position. All returns are measured in dollars.
Column (3) in Table VII reports the results DEMO the sender
regression. Again, all variables except for father’s college status
DEMO signicant. Without controls, the father ’s education variable
becomes much stronger. DEMO average return for senders whose
father graduated from college is 14.75 dollars. The average return
for senders whose fathers did not graduate from college DEMO 9.29
dollars. It appears that senders from families with lower human
capital would have been better off nancially if they had not
trusted their DEMO Comparing senders from high and low
income families also demonstrates these effects. The average
returns for senders from high income families was more than DEMO
dollars greater than the average returns for senders from low
income families. These higher returns appear to come solely from
the ability to elicit DEMO behavior.
We nd that senders who work for pay receive less from the
social interaction. Senders with sexual partners take home over 4
dollars DEMO than their celibate classmates. Individuals who
drink beer earn more. Finally, DEMO one-standard-deviation increase
in the volunteering variable raises nancial returns from the
game by almost 2 dollars.
Since social capital of the sender does not DEMO higher
values of amount sent, but does predict higher values of DEMO
ratio, it seems likely that social capital of the sender has DEMO
nancial externalities for the recipient. Regression (4) in Table
VII conrms this conjecture. We regress the total nancial returns
840
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
of the recipient on our measures of DEMO sender’s social capital. We
nd that all of the social capital variables that increase the
nancial returns for the sender decrease the returns to DEMO
recipient. In this experiment these types of social capital lead to
redistribution from one player to another. As such, the social
capital that we have identied appears to generate private, not
group, returns. Findings like DEMO underscore the importance of
distinguishing between individual and group-level conceptualiza-
tions of social capital.
Finally, we note that these results may not generalize. Social
capital could have increased everyone’s returns in the Trust Game
only if DEMO had increased the level of trust in the rst period. But a
large share of our sample of senders chose to send the maximal
DEMO As such, there may have been insufficient opportunity for
the positive DEMO of social capital to operate on group returns.
Naturally, the earlier DEMO about the limited size of our
sample and the special features of our games and subject popula-
tion apply here as well.

Second, individual characteristics that relate to family sta-
tus, social skill, and charisma strongly predict one’s total nancial
returns in DEMO trust experiment. These variables matter because
people in our sample are less likely to cheat individuals with these
characteristics. These results suggest that some DEMO have
‘‘individual social capital,’’ a subcomponent of human capital that
reects an ability to earn returns from social situations.
There are three major DEMO of this paper for future
research. First, social capital is a DEMO, individual-level
variable that can be studied with the tools of price DEMO Our
evidence supports the view that human capital includes not only
cognitive and physical abilities but also social capital, e.g.,
interpersonal skills, DEMO, and access to social networks (as in
Bowles and Gintis {1976}).
Second, standard survey questions about trust do not appear
to measure trust. However, they do measure trustworthiness,
which is one ingredient of social capital. This means that most
work using these survey questions needs DEMO be somewhat reinter-
preted. If future surveys hope to measure trust, DEMO other
instruments, including questions about past trusting behavior,
should be DEMO and empirically validated.40
Finally, we believe that this paper demonstrates the DEMO of
using experiments and surveys together. Experiments measure
preferences, behavioral propensities, and other individual at-
tributes much more convincingly than surveys, since experiments
provide direct observations of behavior. By connecting experi-
ments and surveys, we can determine the socioeconomic corre-
lates of hard-to-measure individual attributes, and test the
validity of survey measures of these attributes.
39. However, aggregation will be much more difficult than for other forms of
capital.
40. Indirect DEMO measures of attitudes have been shown to be more
effective than direct measures {McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger 1989}.
