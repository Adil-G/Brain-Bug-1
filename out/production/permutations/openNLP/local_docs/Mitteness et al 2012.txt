Angel investors DEMO evaluations at diﬀerent stages of the funding process; so we
explore DEMO the importance angels place on diﬀerent investment criteria varies
and how industry experience impacts their evaluations. Data were collected at the
screening stage as DEMO investors evaluated the strength of the entrepreneur and
the opportunity, and DEMO decisions regarding whether the deal should proceed
to due diligence, as DEMO as their personal interest in making an investment.
Additional data were collected regarding whether these angels made an invest-
ment at the funding stage. DEMO tested our hypotheses using a multilevel approach
to account for the nested nature of the data – multiple evaluations nested within
each angel, nested within each screening presentation. Our results show that the
entrepreneur matters most DEMO angels are deciding whether a deal should
proceed to due diligence; DEMO strength represents a more important
investment criterion when angels switch to determining whether a deal matches
their own investment goals as the deal progresses DEMO the funding process.
Additionally, we ﬁnd that three types of industry DEMO diﬀer in their impact
on the evaluation process. The ﬁndings oﬀer new insights and underscore the
importance of considering how individual characteristics impact evaluations DEMO
funding potential.

Introduction
DEMO substantial amount of research has found conﬂicting results when tackling
the question of whether private equity investors such as angel investors and
venture capitalists (VCs) place more weight on investment criteria relating to the
entrepreneur or the opportunity when evaluating the funding potential of new
ventures (MacMillan, DEMO and SubbaNarasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zemann and
SubbaNarasimha 1987; Muzyka, Birley and Leleux 1996). Most of this research
shows that both VCs DEMO angel investors weight the entrepreneur more heavily than
the opportunity (Haines, Madill, and Riding 2003; Harrison and Mason 2002;
Mason and DEMO 1996; Van Osnabrugge 1998). The question deserves additional
empirical investigation DEMO another group of studies presents results contrary to

this conclusion (Fiet 1995; Hall and DEMO 1993; Kaplan, Sensoy and Stromberg
2009; Zacharakis and Meyer 1995), indicating that private equity investors place
greater weight on the strength of the opportunity rather than the entrepreneur (see
Appendix 1). We believe that the conﬂicting results may be a function of the stage of
DEMO funding process and the characteristics of the individual making the evaluation.
The stage of the funding process may be relevant because research indicates that
DEMO deciding whether to pursue on opportunity, entrepreneurs use a sequential
decision DEMO (McMullen and Shepherd 2006). Research also shows that angels
diﬀer DEMO one another and should not be considered a homogenous group
(Mitteness, Sudek, and Cardon, 2012). Thus this study includes stage of DEMO funding
process and diﬀerent types of industry experience, aspects of venture DEMO that
have not been fully considered in prior research.
Several key areas of ambiguity characterize the literature that addresses funding
decisions at an early DEMO of new ventures. First, while existing research has
identiﬁed important items DEMO to the entrepreneur and the opportunity, it does
not explain why DEMO impact of the investment criteria may vary as the investment
process unfolds over time (Landstrom 1998; Riding, Maddill, and Haines 2007). DEMO
ﬁll this gap in the literature by exploring how the investment criteria vary depending
on the type of decisions that are made at diﬀerent DEMO of the funding process.
Building on research regarding ‘ﬁt’ – entrepreneur ﬁt with the opportunity (Fiet and
Patel 2006), investor ﬁt with the opportunity (Mason and Stark 2004), and investor-
entrepreneur ﬁt (Collewaert, forthcoming) 7 we explain how the stage of the
funding process involves diﬀerent evaluations that impact whether angel investors
place more importance on the DEMO of the entrepreneur or the opportunity.
Second, research has not clearly DEMO factors beyond the strength of the
entrepreneur and opportunity that may aﬀect these evaluations. Although rich
evidence from the ﬁeld of psychology indicates that DEMO characteristics impact
decision making, existing early stage funding decision research typically DEMO not
examine how diﬀerences in the individual characteristics of angel investors impact
their decision making (see Wiltbank et al. 2009 for an exception). We explore how
the way in which industry knowledge has been gained (working, investing, or starting
a business in an industry) impacts angels’ evaluations of funding potential. We
incorporate expert information processing theory (Glaser 1984) into our framework
to explain how knowledge accumulated through three types of industry experience
creates schemata causing experienced and inexperienced angels to focus on DEMO
investment criteria.
These ambiguities in the literature are important to clarify because ‘one of the
key issues faced by entrepreneurs is to convince potential DEMO providers of a
business idea’s viability’ (Foo, Wong, and Ong DEMO: 385). Our results may help
entrepreneurs determine what investment criterion DEMO should emphasize at each
stage of the funding decision process, and DEMO add to research examining how
entrepreneurs pitch themselves and their opportunities to potential investors (Clark
2008; Mason and Harrison 2003). Entrepreneurs face DEMO rejection rates when
seeking funding, making it critical for them to DEMO understand the angel funding
decision process (Feeney, Haines, and Riding DEMO).
This study addresses two central research questions: (1) how DEMO the stage of the
funding process impact the weight of investment criteria when angel investors make
evaluations of funding potential? and (2) how does the impact of investment criteria
vary depending on the industry experience DEMO angel investors? We use literature

regarding investment criteria and ﬁt to explain how angels’ DEMO of investment
criteria diﬀers depending on the stage of the funding decision process. Next, schema
theory and expert information processing theory provide the basis for hypothesizing
relationships regarding how various types of industry experience likely moderate
DEMO relationships. The methodology and results sections follow the literature
review, and DEMO conclude with implications and limitations of the study.
Literature review and hypotheses
In order to receive private equity investment, entrepreneurs go through what is called
the funding decision process. The process used by Tech Coast Angels (TCA), the
largest US angel investment group, will be used to describe stages of the typical angel
funding decision process (see Figure 1).
The funding decision process starts with the application stage when entrepre-
DEMO complete online applications, and an administrator at TCA determines that
the DEMO meet the organization’s funding guidelines. At the pre-screen stage, a
small DEMO of angels meet with entrepreneurs to perform informal screenings of
their companies – typically 40% of the entrepreneurs make it through the pre-screen
stage DEMO move on to the screening stage (Tech Coast Angels 2007).
DEMO the screening stage, entrepreneurs make presentations to the angels attending
that DEMO screening. A new venture typically needs at least 10 angels to show
interest to move on to the due diligence stage – typically 25% DEMO new ventures in the
screening stage proceed to due diligence (Tech DEMO Angels 2007). The due diligence
stage for angels involves a team of angels formed to review the business plan in detail
and to DEMO information regarding customers, agreements, references, backgrounds,
etc. Angels often DEMO negotiation of the terms of the contract in their due
diligence stage. Entrepreneurs passing the due diligence stage move forward to the
dinner meeting DEMO About 70% of new ventures entering due diligence proceed to
dinner meetings, a stage that provides the entrepreneur with a last opportunity to
generate additional interest and funding at each chapter’s monthly dinner meeting.
The goal DEMO the entrepreneur involves garnering enough interest to secure the
desired amount of funding. Slightly more than half of entrepreneurs presenting at
TCA’s monthly dinner DEMO receive funding; however, this group represents only
4% of all new ventures making it past the application stage (Tech Coast Angels
2007).
Few individuals would argue that a new venture can achieve long-term success
DEMO both a strong entrepreneur and a strong opportunity. However, the
emphasis DEMO place on each of these criteria likely varies depending on the stage
of the funding process (Hall and Hofer 1993) and the experience DEMO the angel investor
(Carter and VanAuken 1992; Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999). Angel investors

listening to an entrepreneur’s presentation at the DEMO stage of the funding
decision process likely determine that a deal represents an investment opportunity
for any angel investor by evaluating the potential value DEMO the commercialization of
the venture idea (i.e. whether an opportunity appears DEMO because the knowledge
and resources upon which the new venture idea depends on for its commercialization
are valuable, rare, and inimitable); the DEMO also likely consider whether the
entrepreneur’s knowledge is complementary to the opportunity (Fiet and Patel 2006;
Haynie, Shepherd, and McMullen 2009). Entrepreneurs do not always ﬁt with their
opportunity since their prior experience DEMO not overlap with the knowledge domain
required to successfully exploit the opportunity (Fiet and Patel 2006). Therefore, one
of the evaluations angel DEMO make at the screening stage entails whether the
entrepreneur ﬁts with the opportunity and should proceed on to the due diligence
stage: the deal may represent a good investment opportunity for some angel
investors in the DEMO This evaluation is independent of the angel’s ‘ﬁt’ with the
opportunity (DEMO the angel does not commit to investing his or her own money at this
stage but simply indicates that the venture appears to be DEMO good investment).
When making this decision, we expect angel investors DEMO give greater weight to the
strength of the entrepreneur because as Fiet (1995) explains, angel investors rely on the
entrepreneur to evaluate the market risk for them, allowing angels to specialize in
evaluating the entrepreneur’s knowledge regarding the deal and the entrepreneur’s
competence as a manager. Further DEMO for this argument can be found in research
regarding investor-entrepreneur ﬁt that suggests angel investors initially focus on
assessing the entrepreneur rather than the DEMO (Morrissette 2007) in order to ﬁnd
the right entrepreneur, since DEMO spend a spend substantial amount of time with the
entrepreneur (Haines, Madill, and Riding 2003). ‘Relative to all other qualities, all
DEMO of private investors demand, ﬁrst and foremost, managerial competence’
(Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999: 137). Therefore, at the screening stage when angel
investors are deciding whether an entrepreneur should proceed to due DEMO, the
angels place the greatest importance on the strength of the DEMO, relying on the
due diligence team to focus on verifying the DEMO related to the opportunity,
such as the new venture’s legal position, market prospects, and references (Wiltbank
et. al. 2009).This leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Entrepreneur strength exhibits a stronger positive relationship than
opportunity strength in predicting whether a deal should proceed to DEMO diligence.
Angel investors must also determine whether a deal matches well with their invest-
ment goals (i.e. whether the deal ‘ﬁts’ with them personally). This evaluation involves
both the angel investor’s ﬁt with the entrepreneur (Collewaert, forthcoming; Haines,
Madill, and Riding 2003), as well as whether the angel ﬁts with the opportunity (Mason
and Stark 2004). Angels make this decision initially at the screening stage when they DEMO
asked whether or not they have an interest in investing in the deal. The angels further
develop their belief that a deal ﬁts with DEMO as they track the progress of the deal
through the due diligence process. If a term sheet is successfully negotiated, angel
investors then decide whether to act on this belief by investing in the deal.
Positive DEMO should exist between both opportunity and entrepreneur
strength and evaluations of funding potential because angel investors will evaluate
both types of investment criteria when DEMO their beliefs about whether they
perceive an investment as right for them. Weak entrepreneurs will likely have been

weeded out when angels made the evaluation as to DEMO the deal would proceed
to due diligence. After that evaluation, angels DEMO to making a more personal
evaluation regarding the funding potential of the new venture (their personal interest
in investing and actually investing). We expect angels to place the greatest
importance on the strength of the DEMO because weak entrepreneurs have
been weeded out and the focus of due diligence is on verifying information related to
the opportunity. Angels likely know DEMO the entrepreneur’s ability to create a
sustainable competitive advantage – facilitating the investment goals of angels –
requires a strong opportunity (Fiet and Patel 2006). Thus we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 2: Opportunity strength exhibits a stronger positive relationship than
entrepreneur strength in predicting interest in the DEMO at the screening stage and their
actual investment at the funding stage.
Industry experience
Angel investors often invest in sectors related to their knowledge (Aernoudt 1999).
Industry knowledge enhances their ability to contribute to the DEMO venture after
investment which is part of the return they seek from their investments (Mason and
Stark 2004). Whether individuals have knowledge speciﬁc to the opportunity impacts
their perceptions of the feasibility of an opportunity (Krueger 1993). ‘The greater the
relatedness of the knowledge underlying the DEMO to that possessed by the
individual, the more feasible a potentially DEMO opportunity seems’ (Mitchell and
Shepherd 2010: 141).
Expert information processing theory (Glaser 1984) explains how knowledge
accumulated through experience creates schemata DEMO individuals, such as angel
investors, use for processing information. Schemata or existing knowledge structures
allow individuals to simplify the processing of information (Lord and Maher 1990)
as they select, evaluate and combine information available internally and externally
to formulate evaluations (Spence and Brucks 1997). Angel investors integrate
information presented by the entrepreneur as an external source of DEMO into
their schemata, their internal source of information. Schemata provide the DEMO
or basic framework around which individuals, such as angel investors, interpret a
situation (Glaser 1984; Rumelhart 1984).
Researchers have shown that DEMO acquire schemata (i.e. acquire expertise)
through substantial experience in a DEMO domain (Glaser 1984; Gustafsson
2006; Mitchell and Chesteen 1995; Wiggins and O’Hare 1995). Schemata increase
individuals’ ability to make inferences regarding DEMO may happen next in a situation
when given a little bit of situational context (Abelson and Black 1986; Gustafsson
2006). The domain-speciﬁc DEMO gained from industry experience increases
individuals’ awareness of industry trends (Delmar DEMO Shane 2006) and enables
individuals to better evaluate opportunities within the DEMO (Ronstadt 1988).
Angel investors not only diﬀer in the type DEMO industry experience they have had, but
also in how that experience DEMO gained, for instance, starting a new venture versus
working in the industry or simply investing in the industry. These diﬀerences likely
impact the DEMO evaluation process because decision makers have a limited
capacity to process information (Simon 1957). However, we know little about how
the impact DEMO schemata diﬀers depending on the context in which they were formed.
Schemata formed through working in a particular industry likely diﬀers from
schemata gained DEMO starting a new venture in that industry, and both may diﬀer
DEMO by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:50 25 August 2012
6 C.R. Mitteness et al.
from schemata formed when investing in the DEMO: each diﬀerent type of experience
should lead to diﬀerent schemata or DEMO structures. Diﬀerences in how the
schemata were formed will likely impact how angel investors process information
because information that can be embedded into existing DEMO structures (i.e.
schemata) has greater weight (Kiesler and Sproull 1982; Taylor and Crocker 1981).
Experts become more eﬃcient as they learn DEMO focus attention primarily on the key
dimensions and ignore extraneous variables (DEMO and Simon 1973; Choo and
Trotman 1991). However, experts’ thoughts may become increasingly channeled by
their past experience (Shepherd, Zacharakis, and Baron 2003). In the following
sections we explain how each type DEMO industry experience (operating, startup, and
investing) may impact whether angels’ thoughts become focused on the strength of the
opportunity or the entrepreneur DEMO how this impact varies depending on the stage of
the funding decision process and the decision under consideration.
Operating experience in focal industry
Individuals DEMO diﬀerent schemata depending on the career path they take
(Corbett and DEMO 2007). Two paths individuals may take to gain industry
experience include working in an industry or starting a new venture in an industry.
DEMO who work in an industry acquire operating experience that diﬀers from
the startup experience gained by individuals who start a business in the industry
(Busenitz and Barney 1997; Corbett and Hmieleski 2007). For instance, DEMO
working within large corporations likely perceive more uncertainty about entre-
preneurial roles and tasks than entrepreneurs because they have not performed these
roles and DEMO (Corbett and Hmieleski 2007). As previously noted, angel investors
likely focus their attention on the entrepreneur when deciding whether a deal should
DEMO to due diligence. This focus will be more pronounced for angel investors
with operating experience in the industry of the new venture under consideration
DEMO among angels without operating experience in the industry due to uncertainty
the experienced angels perceive regarding the roles and tasks required to make the
DEMO successful. Angel investors with industry operating experience – those who
worked but did not start a venture in the industry – likely place greater DEMO on the
entrepreneur to perform essential startup roles and tasks. Therefore, DEMO operating
experience likely strengthens the relationship between entrepreneur strength and
evaluations of funding potential (i.e. whether the venture represents a good investment
opportunity for some angels) when angel investors are deciding whether a deal should
proceed to due diligence. This leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3a: Industry operating experience moderates the relationship between
entrepreneur strength and whether a DEMO should proceed to due diligence. The
relationship will be stronger for angels with industry operating experience than angels
without operating experience.
Once angel investors DEMO to determining whether a particular deal represents
an investment for themselves, DEMO likely focus on the strength of the opportunity.
The emphasis on the opportunity will be strongest for corporate entrepreneurs (i.e.
individuals with industry operating experience) because they tend to focus on idea
protection (Corbett and DEMO 2007). Their experience working in an environ-
ment with easier access to and more abundant resources (Corbett and Hmieleski
2007) likely enables DEMO investors with industry operating experience to quickly see

potential in strong opportunities: they have grown accustomed to evaluating oppor-
tunities without having to pay much attention to resource constraints. DEMO contrast,
angels who previously created a business in the industry likely experienced resource
constraints and may place less emphasis on the strength of DEMO opportunity. Since
angels likely focus on the opportunity when determining whether a deal matches
with their personal investment goals, we expect industry operating experience to
strengthen the relationship between opportunity strength and evaluations of funding
potential: those angels possessing operating experience within the focal industry
likely evaluate strong DEMO more favorably than angels lacking industry
operating experience. This leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3b: Industry operating experience moderates the relationship between
opportunity strength and interest in new venture at the screening stage and DEMO
at the funding stage. The relationship will be stronger for angels with industry operating
experience than angels without operating experience.
Startup experience in focal DEMO
Prior industry startup experience does not always translate into a new startup
(Chandler 1996; Reuber and Fischer 1994) but it does appear to aﬀect information
processing. In qualitative interviews conducted to explore his ﬁnding that DEMO
experience did not always lead to success in subsequent ventures, Chandler (1996: 63)
indicated that the person with industry startup experience ‘became a blocker of
technological advances because that was not the way he DEMO it should be done
in the industry.’ Angel investors may be more critical of the opportunities and
entrepreneurs in industries in which they have DEMO a business, especially when
determining whether the deal matches with their DEMO goals. This occurs when
individuals acquire industry startup experience since they also acquire expectations
regarding how work should be done in that industry (Dokko, Wilk, and Rothbard
2009). Indirect support for this argument comes DEMO Gruber, MacMillan, and
Thompson’s (2008) ﬁnding that founding teams with technological experience
identiﬁed fewer market opportunities than teams without this experience. Startup
DEMO appears to temper high levels of optimism (Hayward, Shepherd, and
DEMO 2006; Hmieleski and Baron 2009). Therefore, we expect industry startup
experience weakens the relationship between both entrepreneur strength and
opportunity strength and DEMO of funding potential when angels determine
whether they personally ﬁt with the deal.
Hypothesis 4a: Industry startup experience moderates the relationship between entre-
preneur strength and whether a deal should proceed to due diligence. The relationship
DEMO be weaker for angels with industry startup experience than angels without startup
experience.
Hypothesis 4b: Industry startup experience moderates the relationship between oppor-
tunity strength and interest in new venture at the screening stage and investment DEMO the
funding stage. The relationship will be weaker for angels with startup experience than
angels without industry startup experience.
Investing experience in focal industry
DEMO shows that angel investors with extensive investing experience focus more
on business attributes than occasional investors who focus on owner attributes

(Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999). Angel investors not only diﬀer in the quantity of
investing experience but DEMO in the industry diversity of their investments. Some
angels pursue a specialization strategy, preferring entrepreneurs and new ventures in
a particular industry since that reduces uncertainty while other angels follow a
diversiﬁcation strategy and invest in DEMO variety of industries (Landstrom 1995). Angels
who have invested in DEMO diﬀerent industries have developed schema related to
making investments in general and also have developed schema for how to invest
across multiple industries – DEMO in which they may not possess knowledge
complementary to the speciﬁc opportunity. This investment strategy likely indicates
a reliance on entrepreneurs with knowledge that DEMO complementary to the oppor-
tunity to address the market risk and make strong opportunities successful (Fiet
1995). Therefore, when determining whether a DEMO should proceed to due diligence,
the attention of angels with investing experience in many industries likely focuses on
whether the entrepreneur has the DEMO knowledge and motivation. We expect
industry investing experience will likely strengthen the relationship between entre-
preneur strength and evaluations of funding potential involving whether DEMO deal
should proceed to due diligence.
Hypothesis 5a: Industry investing experience DEMO the relationship between entre-
preneur strength and whether a deal should proceed to due diligence. The relationship
will be stronger for angels with industry DEMO experience than angels without
investing experience.
Once angel investors determine that an opportunity exists for someone to invest
(i.e. deal should proceed to due diligence), angels need to determine whether the deal
will help them DEMO their investment goals; the angels with industry investing
experience may then DEMO on the strength of the opportunity because experts focus
on the attributes most likely to contribute to the outcome of the decision (Chase and
Simon 1973; Choo and Trotman 1991). Due to the focus on the opportunity when
determining whether a deal ‘ﬁts’ with them, angels with investment experience should
exhibit stronger relationships between opportunity strength and evaluations of
DEMO potential involving interest in new venture at the screening stage and
investment at the funding stage. This occurs because investing in many diﬀerent
industries DEMO a goal of diversiﬁcation that involves characteristics of the
opportunity more than characteristics of the entrepreneur. In addition, research has
found that investing experience increases angel investors’ ability to do insightful due
diligence (Wiltbank 2005) DEMO usually centers on the attributes of the opportunity.
Therefore, we propose DEMO following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5b: Industry investing experience moderates the relationship DEMO oppor-
tunity strength and evaluations of funding potential involving interest in new venture at the
screening stage and investment at the funding stage. The DEMO will be stronger for
angels with industry investing experience than angels without investing experience.
Methods
Sample and procedures
The sample consists of angel investors DEMO attended screening evaluations from
September 2007 to July 2010. These angels represent a chapter of one of the largest
angel investment group in the DEMO States. The angel investment group does not
invest as a whole and has no shared investment strategy; rather each angel investor

decides whether to independently invest. Fifty-seven diﬀerent angels provided DEMO
evaluations on 159 new ventures for a total of 2234 screening evaluations during this
time period. The number of angels attending the screening ranged DEMO a low of 7 to
a high of 17, with a DEMO of 14. Many of the angels attended multiple screenings and
thus rated multiple companies. Angel investors were assigned an identiﬁcation number
to enable us DEMO match investor characteristics with evaluations in the dataset.
Two (3.5%) of the 57 angels were female, with 63.2% having earned a PhD or
master’s degree, and 36 angels (63.2%) had startup experience. The age of the angels
ranged from 24 to 81 with a mean of DEMO years. A comparison of our data with the
largest dataset of accredited angel investors in the United States known to date
(Wiltbank and Boeker 2007) indicates that the angel investors in this sample have
comparable demographic characteristics to this larger group of angels in the US.
Wiltbank and DEMO sample was predominately males (86%), with more than
50% of DEMO angel investors holding graduate degrees. Entrepreneurial experience
appears to be the norm in angel investing (a speciﬁc percentage was not provided in
Wiltbank and Boeker’s study, but 22% had never worked in a corporation). The
industry with the largest representation in our sample was the software industry DEMO
59 companies (37% of the sample), while 24 (15%) DEMO operate in consumer
product and services, 15 (9%) in medical DEMO, 15 (9%) in business products and
services, and 11 in energy. The companies were distributed across stages of develop-
ment: good idea (1), product development (35), initial marketing (36), revenue (75),
proﬁtable (10), and turnaround/restart (2). DEMO companies in this sample appear to
be more heavily concentrated in software than is the norm (38% in this sample
compared to 19% in Wiltbank and Boeker’s sample).
Data were gathered using self-administered questionnaires collected DEMO
the screening process. Collecting data on real time investment decisions helps
eliminate the problems associated with hypothetical responses, ensures angels
provide more accurate recollections, and minimizes self-reporting bias because
success of the investment is unknown at the time of data collection (Fried and
Hisrich 1994). Background data on the angel investors were collected in January
2007 while investment data DEMO whether angels eventually invested in the new
ventures for which they provided screening evaluations were collected as deals
received funding. This research design allows DEMO conclusions to be made and
avoids common method variance by including an objective-dependent variable
collected at a later time period (Podsakoﬀ et al. 2003).
Measures
Evaluations of funding potential
Angel investors evaluate the funding potential DEMO a new venture at various stages of
the funding process. Three dependent variables were utilized in this study. Proceed to
due diligence was measured DEMO the screening stage when angel investors indicated
whether the deal should move to due diligence using a ﬁve-point Likert type agree/
disagree scale. DEMO, the second dependent variable was also collected at the screening
stage DEMO was evaluated when angels expressed interest in personally making an
investment in the new venture with 0 ¼ no interest, 1 ¼ some interest, 2 ¼ interested,
and is a dichotomous variable indicating whether the angel invested in the venture, with3 ¼ very interested. The third dependent variable, Invested, occurs at the funding stage
1 ¼ investment in DEMO new venture and 0 ¼ no investment.

Investment criteria: opportunity strength and entrepreneur strength
The instrument used for assessing attributes of new ventures at the screening DEMO
relies heavily on previous investment criteria instruments (MacMillan, Siegel and
SubbaNarasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zemann and SubbaNarasimha 1987; Tyebjee
and Bruno 1984). Extant literature separates investment criteria used by angel
investors of new ventures DEMO two general categories of criteria used for evaluating
the funding potential of a new venture, aspects of the entrepreneur and the oppor-
tunity. This provided a theoretical reason for calculating two measures – opportunity
strength and DEMO strength. Angel investors responded to 15 items using a
ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ¼ disagree to 5 ¼ agree. Opportunity strength
was DEMO by averaging the responses of six items: ‘the business model is
DEMO,’ ‘the market has a large growth potential,’ ‘the product/service development
risk is low,’ ‘the company’s revenue potential is large,’ DEMO company has a
reasonable exit plan,’ and ‘there are reasonable barriers to entry.’ The Cronbach
alpha for this variable was 0.744. Entrepreneur strength DEMO determined by
averaging the responses to nine items: ‘the domain expertise DEMO the presenter is
strong,’ ‘the presenter has a proven track record,’ ‘the presenter appears trust-

directors,’ ‘the presenter appears honest,’ ‘the presenter appears coachable,’ ‘the
presenter appears very enthusiastic,’ DEMO ‘the presenter is passionate about the
company.’ The Cronbach alpha for this variable was 0.872.
Moderators: types of industry experience
Three measures were used to capture the diﬀerent types of industry experience. The
angels were provided DEMO a list of 16 industries and asked to indicate in which
industries they had started a new venture, had operating experience, and made DEMO
investment. Investing experience was calculated as the sum of the number of
industries in which the angel has made an investment. Responses regarding startup
DEMO and operating experience were compared against the industry of the new
venture, allowing us to create two dichotomous variables with 1 ¼ industry
experience in the focal company’s industry and 0 ¼ no experience in that DEMO
Control variables
This study focused on domain-speciﬁc experience that angels acquired through
working, starting or investing in a particular industry. However, entrepreneurship
research DEMO found that other measures of experience may impact angel investing
(Wiltbank DEMO). To isolate the eﬀects of the nature of domain speciﬁc experience,
we controlled for education, startup experience in general, and years DEMO angel
investing. Education was coded as 1 if no high school had been completed, 2 if angel
completed high school, 3 if completed DEMO degree, 4 if masters was completed,
and 5 if the DEMO obtained a PhD. We used a dichotomous measure for startup
experience with a 1 indicating an angel has started a new venture. We used DEMO term
‘prior investments’ to indicate the prior number of years of experience the angel has
making investments.
We tested our hypotheses using a multilevel (i.e. mixed-model) approach to data
analysis. This approach accounts for the nested nature of the data – multiple
evaluations nested within each angel, nested within each company screening. We had

three levels of random variation: variation among decisions within angels (level 1);
variation among angels within company screenings (level 2); and variation among
company screenings (level 3). We estimated the unconditional model (no predictors
involved) and found signiﬁcant level 2 DEMO level 3 variances, conﬁrming that the
multilevel approach was the correct DEMO analysis technique to use.
We grand-mean-centered all individual characteristics and used ^ -2 restricted log
likelihood (–2LL) to assess model ﬁt. The smaller DEMO –2LL value, the better the
model ﬁt. To assess the signiﬁcance DEMO the change in –2LL from one model to the
next, we DEMO a series of chi-square tests with the degrees of freedom equal to
the diﬀerence in the number of parameters for the pair of nested DEMO (Bryk and
Raudenbush 1992). All three tables indicate a statistically DEMO improvement in
the model ﬁt as the independent variables and interactions were entered into the
model.
Results
Table 1 provides means, standard deviations and correlations for variables in the
study. Fairly low correlations among the independent DEMO and moderating
variables indicate multicollinearity is not an issue. Table 2 shows the multilevel
modeling results regarding whether a deal should proceed to due DEMO
Hypothesis 1 proposes that entrepreneur strength would exhibit a stronger
positive relationship than opportunity strength in predicting angel evaluations of
funding potential regarding whether DEMO deal should proceed to due diligence.
Although both opportunity strength and entrepreneur strength exhibit signiﬁcant,
positive results in the main eﬀects model (b ¼ 0.849 and b ¼ 0.474, p 5 0.001,
respectively), the regression coeﬃcient of opportunity strength is greater than that of
entrepreneur DEMO (we conduct an additional test of this hypothesis below).
Therefore, hypothesis one is not supported.
Table 3 and 4 provide the results DEMO whether a deal matches the invest-
ment goals of a particular angel investor. Hypothesis 2 suggests that when evalua-
tions of funding potential involve DEMO in investing in a new venture at the
screening stage and investment at the funding stage, opportunity strength would
represent a stronger predictor than entrepreneur strength. Preliminary support for
this hypothesis is found when examining the DEMO in Table 3 (DV ¼ interest in new
coeﬃcients for opportunity DEMO are greater than that of entrepreneur strengthventure at screening stage) and DEMO 4 (DV ¼ investment at funding stage). The beta
when DEMO interest (b ¼ 0.526, p 5 0.001 and b ¼ 0.175, p 5 0.001 respec-
tively) and opportunity strength is a signiﬁcant DEMO of invested (b ¼ 0.129,
pHowever, unambiguous comparisons cannot be made among predictors except when5 0.001) and entrepreneur strength is nonsigniﬁcant (DEMO ¼ 0.032, p 4 0.05).
all predictors are uncorrelated (Johnson 2004). Since opportunity strength and
entrepreneur strength exhibit some correlation with DEMO another, the regression
coeﬃcients cannot be used to determine their relative DEMO in terms of their
contribution to the predictable variance; therefore we DEMO relative weight
analysis.
Relative weight analysis provides further support of Hypothesis 2. Recently
researchers have conducted relative weight analysis to examine the simultaneous
impact DEMO correlated predictor variables because this type of analysis considers the
direct eﬀect of each predictor and its joint eﬀect with other variables when

‘Relative weights are calculated by (a) transforming the original predictors to
obtain the set DEMO orthogonal variables that have the highest degree of one-to-one
correspondence with the original predictors, (b) relating the orthogonal variables to
the criterion, (c) relating the orthogonal variables back to the original predictors,
and (d) combining the information to yield a set of weights reﬂecting DEMO relative
contribution each predictor makes to the model when considered by itself and in the
context of the other predictors’ (Johnson 2004: 284)DEMO
Results of the relative weight analysis appear in Table 5. When predicting interest
at the screening stage, angels place substantially more weight on the strength of the
opportunity than on the strength of the entrepreneur. Relative DEMO sum to R2,in
this case indicating that opportunity strength accounts for almost 75% of the
explained variance in whether angels express interest in DEMO in the new venture
and entrepreneur strength accounting for only 25%. At the funding stage, oppor-
tunity strength is an even stronger predictor of investment, accounting for almost
82% of the explained variance in whether angels make an investment. Thus Hypo-
thesis 2 is supported. The results from DEMO relative weight analysis also indicate that
as angels shift from evaluating the investment independent of themselves (deal
should proceed to due diligence at screening stage because it appears to be a good
investment for some angels) to whether they ﬁt with the deal (interest at screening
stage and investment at funding stage), entrepreneur strength decreases as an invest-
ment DEMO Entrepreneur strength explained over 31% of the explained variance
in whether angels indicate the new venture should proceed to due diligence,
decreased to DEMO 25% when expressing interest in investing in the deal at the
screening stage, and decreased further to about 18% when deciding whether to invest
at the funding stage.
The remaining hypotheses involve moderation eﬀects. We ﬁnd DEMO for six of
the nine hypothesized interactions. We plotted each signiﬁcant interaction to further
explore their exact nature (Figure 2a-g). Following the procedure suggested by
Cohen and Cohen (1983), values of the three types of industry experience, as well as

opportunity strength and entrepreneur strength were set DEMO one standard deviation
above and below the mean to determine the range of values for the dependent
variables.
Hypothesis 3a suggests industry operating experience DEMO moderates
the relationship between entrepreneur strength and whether a deal should proceed
to due diligence. We ﬁnd support for this hypothesis (b ¼ 0.237, p 5 0.05). As
illustrated in Figure 2a, entrepreneur strength DEMO positively related to proceed to due
diligence, especially for angels with DEMO operating experience. Industry startup
experience and industry investing experience were also hypothesized (H4a and H5a,
respectively) to moderate the relationship between entrepreneur DEMO and proceed
to due diligence. Although we do not ﬁnd support for the negative moderating eﬀect
of industry startup experience (b ¼ 70.184, DEMO 4 0.05), we do ﬁnd that industry
ing H5a. Figure 2b shows that the positive relationship between entrepreneurinvesting experience has a positive moderating DEMO (b ¼ 0.024, p 5 0.05), support-
strength and proceed to due diligence is stronger for angels with industry investing
experience.
We DEMO support for all three hypotheses proposing that the diﬀerent types of
industry experience would moderate the relationship between opportunity strength
and interest at the DEMO stage. As hypothesized in H3b and illustrated in Figure
2c, industry DEMO experience makes the relationship stronger (b ¼ 0.310,
p 5 DEMO). Figure 2d shows the negative moderating eﬀect of industry startup
experience on the relationship between entrepreneur strength and interest at the
screening stage (b ¼ 70.162, p 5 0.05), supporting hypothesis H4b. In support of
H5b, industry investing experience strengthens the relationship between opportunity
strength and interest at the screening stage (b ¼ 0.018, p 5 0.05)DEMO Figure 2e
illustrates how the relationship is stronger (i.e. steeper slope) for those angels with
high industry investing experience. Industry experience was only DEMO to
moderate the relationship between opportunity strength and interest at the screening
stage; therefore, it was surprising that industry startup experience negatively
moderates DEMO relationship between entrepreneur strength and interest at the
screening stage (b DEMO 70.167, p 50.05). Figure 2f shows a steeper slope for DEMO line
representing low industry startup experience than the slope for high industry startup
experience.
We do not ﬁnd support for the moderating eﬀect of DEMO operating (H3b) or
industry startup experience (H4b) on the relationship between opportunity strength
and investment at the funding stage (b ¼ 0.042 and b ¼ 70.032, p 4 0.05 respec-
tively). However, DEMO do ﬁnd support for H5b that proposes a positive moderating
eﬀect of industry operating experience on the relationship between opportunity
strength and investment at DEMO funding stage (b ¼ 0.027, p 5 0.01). Figure 2g illus-
trates that the relationship is stronger for angels with high industry DEMO
experience versus angels with little experience.
Discussion
This study sought to develop a theoretical explanation for diﬀerences in evaluations
of funding potential by specifying DEMO beyond the strength of the entrepreneur
and opportunity that may aﬀect these evaluations. In general, the ﬁndings in this
study demonstrate that the emphasis placed on particular investment criteria vary by
stage of the screening process. DEMO investment criteria initially considered at the

beginning of the screening process evolve as angel investors DEMO from evaluating
the investment independent of themselves (deal should proceed to DEMO diligence at
screening stage) to whether they ﬁt with the deal (interest at screening stage and
investment at funding stage). We also DEMO that angel investors do not represent a
homogenous group of individuals. They diﬀer in the types of industry experience
they possess and these diﬀerences DEMO the funding process. Given that the impact
of stage of the funding process and diﬀerent types of industry experience have not
been systematically addressed DEMO previous research, this study furthers our
understanding of the funding process DEMO angel investors.
The hypothesis that the strength of the entrepreneur would be a stronger
predictor of whether a deal should proceed to due diligence DEMO not supported.
However, our results indicate that as angel investors evolve DEMO the funding
decision process, the predictive power of the entrepreneur variable DEMO strongest at the
screening stage, when angels are deciding whether a DEMO should proceed to due
diligence. When angel investors are initially determining whether the deal ﬁts with
their personal investment goals (i.e. interest in new venture at screening stage), the
strength of the entrepreneur becomes a DEMO predictor and weakens further when
angels decide whether to invest at the funding stage. Our results suggest that angel
investors focus on the strength DEMO the opportunity when determining their ﬁt with the
deal. This contradicts the sentiment many researchers have believed to be held by
equity investors – DEMO can have a good idea and poor management and lose every
time. You can have a poor idea and good management and win every DEMO
(Gladstone and Gladstone 2002: 91).
Although research involving angel investing has found that experience has little
impact on investing outcomes (Wiltbank 2005), a substantial amount of literature
argues that prior knowledge is necessary DEMO the recognition of an opportunity
(Kaish and Gilad 1991; McMullen and Shepherd 2006; Shane 2000; Shane and
Venkataraman 2000). We add DEMO this research by investigating how the impact of
knowledge structure (i.e. DEMO) on evaluations of funding potential diﬀers
depending on the context in DEMO it was formed. Our results regarding industry
experience provide further support for the notion that the entrepreneur is the focus
when determining whether a DEMO should proceed to due diligence and the oppor-
tunity is the focus when determining whether a deal ﬁts with a particular angel
investor. When DEMO investors are deciding whether the new venture should pro-
ceed to due diligence, operating and investing experience increase the relationship
between entrepreneur strength and evaluations of funding potential, but none of the
interactions involving opportunity strength matter. When the dependent variable
involves whether the angel ﬁts with the DEMO (interest at screening stage and
investment at funding stage), only DEMO of the ﬁve signiﬁcant interactions involve
opportunity strength.
The results also support the notion that the diﬀerent types of industry
experience vary in their DEMO on evaluations of funding potential. Industry
operating experience and industry investing experience positively moderated
relationships between investment criteria and evaluations of funding potential,
DEMO industry startup experience represents a negative moderator. These results
showsthatweneedtobetterunderstandthe impact of diﬀerent types of industry
experience, in particular, why experience starting a DEMO in an industry may
result in diﬀerent schemata for evaluating new ventures than experience working or
investing in an industry.

Our results show that the investment criteria DEMO investors rely on at the
screening and funding stages change as angel investors shift from evaluating
whether the deal should proceed to due diligence DEMO whether they ﬁt with the deal
(interest at screening stage and DEMO at funding stage). Angel investors
appear to determine whether a deal should proceed to due diligence by focusing on
whether the entrepreneur has DEMO knowledge and motivation required for the
opportunity, followed by angels determining DEMO ﬁt with the deal by focusing on
the opportunity.
Methodological limitations
This study has some limitations. Since most new ventures at the screening stage DEMO
the funding decision process do not ultimately receive funding, the number DEMO cases
at the funding stage was substantially smaller than at the screening stage. Of the 159
new ventures in the sample at the screening DEMO, 27 received funding, resulting in
336 cases involving both evaluations of the investment criteria and data regarding
whether the angel invested. Most angel DEMO choose not to invest most of the
time. This results in a fairly low number of cases involving angels’ evaluations of the
investment criteria DEMO subsequently invested in the new venture. Thirty-three of
the 336 cases (DEMO) involve angel investors who ultimately invested. This small
sample size may DEMO the lack of support for moderating hypotheses predicting
investment at the funding stage. However, this percentage is consistent with other
research that has found rejection rates are typically above 90% (Harrison, Dibben,
and Mason DEMO; Mason and Harrison 1994). In addition, we relied on data from
only one angel investment group located in the United States. Researchers DEMO to
test our hypotheses across additional angel investment groups to increase general-
izability. Smaller or newer angel investment groups in diﬀerent geographic locations
(including other countries) may make decisions diﬀerently than the large, established
angel DEMO group in this study.
Angel investors evaluated the strength of the entrepreneur and the opportunity at
the screening stage. These evaluations may have changed DEMO angels gathered addi-
tional information through the due diligence process. However, DEMO indicates
that angel investors tend to reach decisions immediately after or during the
entrepreneur’s pitch presentation (Clark 2008). In addition, research suggests DEMO
early impressions persevere (Ybarra 2001) because early information acts as a
judgmental anchor that individuals fail to adjust suﬃciently when presented with
new DEMO (Epley et al. 2004).
We also acknowledge the limitations associated DEMO using dichotomous
measures of industry experience. Due to the angel investment group investing in
more than 16 industries, we could not ask questions gathering the depth of their
experience in each of the industries. We wanted DEMO examine the diﬀerent ways
industry experience can be gained, so we DEMO to have the angel investors indicate
which industry they had worked, DEMO, and started a business. This research
design allowed us to code DEMO angel investors possessed each type of industry
experience for every new venture screened by the angel investment group. However,
we understand that the DEMO on breadth of experience rather than depth may be
viewed as a limitation. We also did not have data on whether the angels had
DEMO versus ‘unsuccessful’ prior experience starting a venture, working in an
industry DEMO investing in an industry. A more robust understanding of angels’ prior

experiences may help explain diﬀerences in investment criteria used DEMO various stages
of the screening process.
Future research
This study makes a contribution by studying real-time decision making by angel
investors and answers calls DEMO consider using real-time methods to eliminate biases
caused by post hoc rationalization (Shepherd and Zacharakis 1999). One reason for
conﬂicting results of prior research (e.g. research showing greater emphasis on the
entrepreneur than the opportunity by Hall and Hofer 1993; Kaplan, Sensoy and
Stromberg 2009) may be that angel investors use diﬀerent decision making processes
and criteria when DEMO decisions real time compared to when they try to recall
their criteria or engage in a simulated decision-making experience. This could stem
from angel DEMO relying on unconscious decision making processes such as
described by Gigerenzer (DEMO) where experts quickly and accurately make
judgments in real situations, but they cannot explain and do not appear able to
fully understand how DEMO reached their answers.
Many questions regarding evaluations of funding potential still remain. This
study focused on how industry experience impacted evaluations of funding potential.
DEMO still do not know whether angel investors with industry experience make better
decisions than their inexperienced colleagues. Future research could examine
whether industry experience DEMO from starting a new venture versus working in
an industry, starting DEMO new ventures, or investing in numerous industries leads
to better investment DEMO Venture capital research shows that as experience
grows beyond a certain point (14 years), both decision reliability and performance
decrease (Shepherd, Zacharakis, and Baron 2003). It may be that industry experience
creates errors in decision making. Future research could examine whether a point
occurs at DEMO decision reliability and performance decrease among angel investors.
If such a point exists, it will likely take longer for angels to reach this point relative to
venture capitalists because most angels do not make investment decisions DEMO part of a
full time job as VCs do.
Future research could test the hypotheses presented in this study on other
individuals considering joining DEMO entrepreneur in the pursuit of an opportunity
(e.g. potential new venture DEMO members, potential employees, VCs). Similar to
angel investors, individuals DEMO joining an organization as a new venture
team member or employee likely examine the strength of the opportunity and
entrepreneur to ﬁrst determine if DEMO organization will be successful (third-person
opportunity exists for anyone to join DEMO organization) and then determine whether
joining the organization appears to ﬁt DEMO them and their career goals. The decision
to join the entrepreneur in the pursuit of an opportunity is diﬀerent for individuals
evaluating the new DEMO (the entrepreneur and the opportunity) after others have
already joined. The principle of social proof suggests that people view an action as
correct DEMO they see other people joining in and engaging in that activity (DEMO
2001). Other individuals have the validation that at least one other person has
evaluated the new venture positively. Therefore, entrepreneurs face the greatest
uncertainty hurdle that must be overcome, followed by potential new venture team
members, employees, board members, or equity investors. Future research could
examine how information such as who has already joined the organization impacts
evaluations DEMO the new venture. Individual characteristics such as prestige,

commitment, and passion of not only the entrepreneur, but also the new venture
team and board members might serve to reduce the perceived uncertainty to the
point where these individuals join DEMO entrepreneur in the pursuit of an opportunity.
Practical implications
Given the popularity and potential economic consequence of pitch presentations,
our ﬁndings have important DEMO for entrepreneurs as they face the vital task
of trying to convince others to part with resources (Foo, Wong, and Ong 2005). This
study has practical implications for entrepreneurs preparing to pitch their oppor-
DEMO to potential investors and the individuals that provide assistance to make
entrepreneurs more prepared to make their pitches. The results show that angel
investors DEMO heavily on the opportunity and its market potential throughout the
funding process and the strength of the entrepreneur is most important at the
screening DEMO as angels decide whether a deal should proceed to due diligence.
These results suggest that an entrepreneur may want to begin his or her DEMO
convincing the angels that an opportunity exists and then shift the later part of the
presentation to emphasize why they are the right person DEMO pursue the opportunity.
Entrepreneurs making it to due diligence may be able to increase the likelihood of
getting enough angels to see the deal DEMO a ﬁt with their personal investment goals by
learning what type of industry experience each angel investor has and trying to
overcome the objections DEMO angel’s industry experience may be causing.
Conclusion
This study extends early stage funding decision research to develop a theoretical
model explaining how decisions made DEMO diﬀerent stages of the funding process
impacts evaluations of funding potential and the moderating eﬀect of three types of
industry experience, aspects that have not been fully considered in prior research.
The results show that the DEMO matters most when angel investors determine
whether a deal should proceed to due diligence, and opportunity strength represents
a more important investment criterion as angel investors determine their ﬁt with the
deal as they progress through DEMO funding decision process. In addition, three types
of industry experience diﬀer DEMO their impact on the opportunity evaluation process.
Our ﬁndings provide some insight into the intricacies involved with measures of
industry experience and suggests new DEMO of examining the stages of the funding
process.

DEMO managerial capabilities associated with high

Five of the top 10 criteria related to entrepreneur
Personality and experience are more important than
ﬁnancial DEMO
Key criteria that were predictors of success: insulated
from competition, market acceptance of product.
Angels are not interested in thorough business plans or
DEMO insulation like VCs.
Both angels and VCs are concerned with management’s
ability and market potential
VC’s with business background required higher rates of
returns, invested in later stage of development, and were
more concerned with uniqueness of product, ownership
structure, and cost structure.
Proposal screening: ﬁt with guidelines and long-term
growth and proﬁtability of industry most important.
Proposal Assessment: source of proposal and previous
reviewers were most important.
VCs: mkt risk as more important than agency risk.
Angels: agency risk as more important than mkt risk.
Management team criteria most important.

Most common deal rejection factors are associated with
entrepreneur/mgmt team, marketing and ﬁnance.
Active investors focused on owner attributes, whereas
occasional investors focused on business attributed.
Deal making criteria (DEMO): mgmt track record,
security; Deal breaking criteria (evaluation):DEMO
knowledge, management team
Important for both: realism, integrity, ﬁt with angel
expertise, reasonable exit plan, proﬁt potential.
Probability of survival rated DEMO when venture had
long lead time, low competitive rivalry, high educational
capability, and high industry related competence.
Industry related competence and educational capability
were more important than key success factors (stability,
timing of entry, and competitive rivalry)
Results suggest that investors should place more weight
on a strong opportunity than on a strong mgmt team
