Autonomy is an important component of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO), DEMO most
studies that assess the EO construct do not include autonomy measures. This article ﬁrst
addresses the theoretical relevance of autonomy as an element DEMO ﬁrm-level entrepreneurial
behavior. After a review of existing autonomy measures, it DEMO proposes scale items to test
the autonomy dimension of EO. Finally, DEMO reports the results of two studies of the proposed
autonomy scale and addresses implications for future EO-related autonomy research.
Introduction
The independent spirit and DEMO of action necessary to advance new venture
development is a driving force of entrepreneurial value creation (Burgelman, 2001). For
entrepreneurship to thrive DEMO many organizational contexts, “the exercise of autonomy by
strong leaders, unfettered teams, or creative individuals who are disengaged from orga-
nizational constraints” is required (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 140). Autonomy affords
organizational members the freedom and ﬂexibility to develop and enact entrepreneurial
initiatives.
In DEMO context of strategic entrepreneurship, autonomy enables both opportunity-
seeking and advantage-seeking DEMO (Ireland, Hitt, & Sirmon, 2003). Strategic entre-
preneurship refers in part to creating competitive advantages by using entrepreneurial
initiatives to pursue DEMO (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990), and transforming existing
organizations by redeploying resources (Zahra, 1993) and renewing strategic capabilities
(Guth & Ginsberg, 1990). The effective use of autonomy, in organizational structures and
by entrepreneurial champions, is needed to achieve such results. In organizations with
strong entrepreneurial cultures, practices aimed at fostering autonomy, such as W.L. Gore’s
DEMO in “the power of small teams” (Deutschman, 2004), are designed to create environ-
ments where autonomous behavior stimulates entrepreneurial outcomes.Autonomy may be
DEMO more important in settings where strategic renewal occurs only because key individu-
als champion entrepreneurial initiatives that transform an organization’s strategic posture

(Burgelman, 1983; Kreiser, Marino, Davis, Tang, & Lee, DEMO press). Because of its impor-
tance to entrepreneurship, Lumpkin and DEMO (1996) highlighted autonomy as a key
dimension of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO).
Although the role and importance of some types of autonomy have been studied
in prior management research (e.g., Hackman & Oldham, 1975; Hart, 1991), few studies
have investigated how autonomy contributes DEMO the entrepreneurial value creation process.
A primary reason for this shortcoming, DEMO believe, is the absence of an effective means
to measure autonomy DEMO an EO context. Therefore, the purpose of this article is twofold:DEMO
(1) to investigate autonomy from an EO perspective, exploring the DEMO that autonomy
plays in entrepreneurial value creation; and (2) to DEMO clarity, both theoretically and
empirically, regarding the measurement of ﬁrm-level autonomy.
In the next two sections, we address the type of autonomy that is found in organiza-
tions with a strong EO. This discussion will DEMO to distinguish entrepreneurial autonomy
from other types of autonomy found in the management literature. We then propose an
autonomy scale aimed at complementing and DEMO existing EO measures (Covin &
Slevin, 1986, 1989). Next, we report the ﬁndings of two studies conducted to demonstrate
the content validity and discriminant validity of the proposed autonomy scale and discuss
content DEMO issues surrounding the dimensions of EO. Finally, we address the
measurement DEMO of our proposed autonomy scale and implications of our scale-
development efforts for future EO research.
The Role of Autonomy in an Entrepreneruial Orientation DEMO
The ﬁrst purpose of this article is to examine the role of autonomy from an EO
perspective. EO has emerged as a major concept DEMO both strategic management and
entrepreneurship literatures. Many successful ﬁrms attribute their success to an EO
(McGrath & MacMillan, 2000), an approach to DEMO making that draws on entrepre-
neurial skills and capabilities. An EO keeps ﬁrms alert by exposing them to new tech-
nologies, making them aware of marketplace trends, and helping them evaluate new
possibilities. By keeping decision makers focused on industry changes and customer
demand, an EO helps companies identify opportunities and launch new ventures. As a
result, ﬁrms that exhibit a strong EO generally have higher performance (e.g., Rauch,
Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, in press).
Although Lumpkin and Dess proposed DEMO inclusion of autonomy as a dimension of
EO in 1996, few DEMO studies have investigated autonomy as an element of EO. This lack
of inclusion, we believe, has occurred for two reasons. First, autonomy is not one of the
“original” dimensions of EO identiﬁed by Miller (1983) and developed by Covin and
Slevin (1986, 1989)—innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking. Further, some
researchers have suggested that autonomy is an antecedent of entrepreneurial behavior
rather than one of its essential components. In DEMO remainder of this section, we provide
a more in-depth argument in DEMO of the central role of autonomy in a ﬁrm’s EO.
Second, DEMO adoption of the autonomy dimension has been impeded by the lack of a valid
ﬁrm-level scale that measures autonomy from an EO perspective. Although DEMO
autonomy scales have been used in prior management research, few are DEMO for
assessing EO-related autonomy. Following this section, therefore, we address approaches
to measuring autonomy that are relevant in an EO context.
Organizations that DEMO on an EO to create new value and grow must make an extra
effort to foster entrepreneurial behavior (Burgelman & Sayles, 1986; Kanter, 1983). This
often involves freeing organizational members—both individuals and teams—to operate
48
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
outside an organization’s existing norms and strategies where they can think and DEMO more
independently. In the context of EO, therefore, autonomy is essential to the processes of
leveraging a ﬁrm’s existing strengths, identifying opportunities that are beyond the orga-
nization’s current capabilities, and encouraging the development of new ventures and/or
improved business practices (Kanter, North, Bernstein, & Williams, 1990). As such,
numerous scholars have argued that DEMO is required for entrepreneurial initiatives to
emerge and thrive, and constitutes DEMO basic feature of entrepreneurially oriented organiza-
tions (e.g., Antoncic & Hisrich, 2003; Burgelman & Sayles; Kanter).
Independent entrepreneurial action provides the impetus needed to explore business
opportunities, bring forth business concepts, and DEMO them through to completion (Bird,
1988; McMullen & Shepherd, DEMO). Decision making by individuals or teams who are
unhindered by strategic norms or organizational traditions that may impede them is
necessary to effectively DEMO entrepreneurial possibilities and champion new
venture concepts (Burgelman, 1983; Green, Brush, & Hart, 1999). Prior research supports
the view that, within organizations, autonomy encourages innovation, promotes the
launching of entrepreneurial ventures, and increases the competitiveness and effectiveness
of ﬁrms (Brock, 2003; Burgelman, 2001). By contrast, ﬁrms that are overly dependent on
participativeness DEMO decision making and require consensus to be reached before launch-
ing entrepreneurial initiatives may suffer ﬁnancially (Covin, Green, & Slevin, 2006).
DEMO an organizational context, both “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches may be
useful DEMO encouraging autonomy (Quinn & Spreitzer, 1997). Companies with an overall
entrepreneurial mission use a top-down approach to stimulate entrepreneurial activity
(Birkinshaw, DEMO). For example, in organizations such as 3M and the Virgin DEMO, top
managers support programs and incentives that foster a climate of DEMO and
welcome autonomous decision making. These companies are well-known for supporting
the type of independent thinking and action that is characteristic of autonomy. W.L. DEMO,
for example, encourages employees to spend up to ten percent DEMO their time exploring
speculative new ideas, allows for the championing of DEMO venture concepts by any
organizational member, and supports small teams because DEMO believes they promote
autonomy (Deutschman, 2004). For companies such as Gore, autonomy is a deﬁning
feature of their organizational design. Prior analysis suggests that such organizational
design features may be as important to entrepreneurial DEMO as the other dimensions of
EO because ﬁrms are able to “become more entrepreneurial through processes and
structures as well as by introducing new DEMO and/or entering new markets” (Dess
et al., 2003, p. DEMO).
Many of the best ideas for entrepreneurial ventures, however, come from the bottom
up. To encourage autonomous decision making at the grass DEMO of such organizations,
special incentives and structural arrangements designed to develop and build support
for entrepreneurial ventures may be required (Helgesen, 1996)DEMO In some organizations,
however, even the best ideas are not DEMO by top management (Dougherty & Hardy,
1996). Whether entrepreneurial DEMO are supported or stiﬂed, it is often the autono-
mous efforts DEMO key individuals acting outside the chain of command which generate
entrepreneurial outcomes (Burgelman, 1983). Such individuals, often referred to as cham-
pions, provide the impetus needed to pursue opportunities or implement an entrepreneur-
ial vision (Bird, 1988; Green et al., 1999). Autonomous individuals, operating outside
their usual work routines and practices to stimulate entrepreneurial development DEMO
growth, represent an important source of creativity and initiative in many DEMO
settings (Burgelman & Sayles, 1986).
This top-down, bottom-up contrast DEMO roughly parallel to a distinction found in prior
autonomy research. Autonomy is often viewed as having a hierarchical-type construction,

that is, different levels or degrees of autonomy depending on the types of actions or
decisions a group can control (Gulowsen, 1972). DEMO extent to which a group has control
or can make decisions about factors within the work environment can be referred to
as structural autonomy (Gulowsen). Also referred to as “autonomy of means” (Bouchard,
2002), structural autonomy enables a team to solve a problem with self-determined DEMO
(within given resource constraints). By contrast, strategic autonomy or “autonomy of
goals” (Bouchard), refers to the extent to which a group has control over ends, i.e., its
goals. Strategic autonomy enables a DEMO to operate outside normal organizational con-
straints in addressing what it will accomplish and how it will achieve its objectives.
Viewing autonomy on a DEMO scale, strategic autonomy would possess a superior
(or higher) position DEMO to structural autonomy.
Autonomy from an EO perspective refers primarily to strategic autonomy. These
higher levels or strategic dimensions of autonomy enable a team (or individual) to not
only solve problems, but to actually deﬁne DEMO problem and the goals that will be met in
order to solve that problem. Levels of strategic autonomy can be likened to Hart’s (1992)
generative mode of strategy making, or Gulowsen’s (1972) qualitative goal autonomy.
Hart’s generative mode depends on organizational members behaving in an autonomous
DEMO as they pursue innovation (Hart). The role of top management DEMO this mode is to
encourage innovation by facilitating experimentation and risk taking through organiza-
tional systems and informal processes at both individual and team DEMO The level of
autonomy a team possesses has been positively related to effective knowledge manage-
ment, such that higher levels of autonomy facilitate knowledge creation, transfer, and
application (Janz & Prasarnphanich, 2005; Smith, DEMO). As autonomy becomes increas-
ingly strategic, there will be an DEMO in the type of sharing and facilitating of knowl-
edge that fosters entrepreneurial outcomes. Thus, for a ﬁrm to achieve a high level of
EO, autonomy should exist at the strategic level. By contrast, although DEMO
autonomy is necessary to obtain ﬁrm-level autonomy, we posit that it DEMO not be suf-
ﬁcient to enhance entrepreneurial performance. In the next section, we evaluate the
major autonomy scales that have been used in prior research to identify the types of
structural and strategic elements that need DEMO be included in an EO-based autonomy
scale.
Measuring Autonomy
Organizational autonomy is an established concept within the management literature
and has been described using DEMO variety of frameworks. Autonomy can be possessed by
either individuals or groups and can exist for either lower-level employees or among more
senior decision DEMO (Langfred, 2000). Gulowsen (1972) viewed autonomy as a single-
dimensional construct; more recent research suggests that autonomy is a multidimen-
sional construct, and that the type of autonomy may be as important as the amount (e.g.,
Janz, Colquitt, & Noe, 1997). DEMO (1982) argues that individuals and work groups
cannot be classiﬁed simply as autonomous or not autonomous; instead, types and levels of
autonomy DEMO along key continua. Thus, prior autonomy research has addressed several
different DEMO of management-related autonomy.
Existing Autonomy Scales
As part of our study, DEMO undertook a comprehensive review of the autonomy literature
to ﬁnd extant scales used to measure autonomy. A summary of these scales is presented in

Work Group Autonomy Scale (WGA). The 10-item work-group autonomy scale created
by Gulowsen (1972) DEMO the ﬁrst of its kind and is still used as a basis for modiﬁed scales
today (e.g., Woywode, 2002; Wright & Barker, 2000). Gulowsen proposed that autonomy
is a one-dimensional property that can DEMO measured in terms of degrees, i.e., hierarchi-
cally. In order to reach a certain level or degree of autonomy, according to Gulowsen, DEMO
group must satisfy all criteria that precede it on the scale of autonomy. Thus, groups with
a higher level of autonomy will exhibit more WGA-scale elements than groups with lower
levels of autonomy. Groups cannot make DEMO decisions (such as inﬂuencing
qualitative and quantitative goals) unless lower-level decisions are also made. Further, if
one level of autonomy low on the scale is dependent on certain external conditions, all
levels of autonomy higher on the scale are equally dependent on those conditions
(Gulowsen). The WGA begins with the ability of group members to determine their own
DEMO methods and moves to increasingly strategic issues such as the group’s ability
to inﬂuence qualitative goals and/or decide on issues of leadership.
Job DEMO Survey (JDS). Hackman and Oldham (1975) proposed that ﬁve DEMO
characteristics—skill variety, task identity, task signiﬁcance, feedback, and autonomy—
ultimately create positive personal and work outcomes (e.g., work motivation, satisfac-
tion, performance). Each job characteristic dimension is measured with three items
(DEMO three autonomy items, which assess decision latitude, personal initiative, and
DEMO for independence). The core job dimensions are combined into a single
“motivating potential score” (Hackman & Oldham), which indicates the degree to which
January, 2009 51
the respondent’s objective job characteristics will prompt internal work motivation. The
JDS DEMO still commonly used to measure the relationship between job characteristics,
internal motivation, and work outcomes (e.g., Abbott, Boyd, & Grant, DEMO).
Work Method Autonomy Scale (WMA). The 9-item WMA scale DEMO initially reported by
Breaugh in 1985 and further reﬁned in 1999 (DEMO, 1999). The scale contains items
which assess three structural dimensions DEMO autonomy: work method, work scheduling,
and work criteria. As deﬁned by Breaugh (1999), work method autonomy entails how
much discretion or choice individuals have about the methods and procedures they use in
completing DEMO work. Work scheduling autonomy assesses how much control the workers
feel they have over scheduling, sequencing, and timing of their activities at work. DEMO,
work criteria autonomy addresses how much workers can modify or choose the criteria
that are used for evaluating their performance. While the actual DEMO scale is not
frequently used in other studies, the concepts of DEMO method, work scheduling, and work
criteria autonomy are often cited as key elements of autonomy (e.g., Denton & Kleiman,
2001; Stavroulakis, 1997).
Group Participation Index (GPI). Little (1988) developed DEMO GPI using suggestions
from Gulowsen (1972). The purpose of the DEMO GPI is to measure both autonomy and
global job satisfaction, as DEMO are dominant interests in organizational studies. Nineteen
items within the scale analyze both individual and group-level autonomy. Although the
GPI scale may be used DEMO compare autonomy with satisfaction, that is not its primary
objective. It DEMO a variety of purposes including comparing existing work groups in terms
of levels of autonomy, examining effects of organizational or technological change, and/DEMO
monitoring the effects of change over time (Little).
Strategy-Making Modes (SMM). Hart’s (1991) 25-item strategy-making process scale
includes four strategy-making DEMO: rational, transactive, symbolic, and generative.
These modes differ along two dimensions: management intentionality and autonomy of
organizational actors. In the rational mode, strategy is deliberate and organizational actors
lack autonomy. When autonomy is still lacking, but strategy is emergent, the transactive
mode is represented. In DEMO symbolic mode, strategy is deliberate but actor behavior is
autonomous. Finally, the generative mode is represented by emergent strategy and
autonomous actor behavior. DEMO of the 25 SMM items are designed speciﬁcally to
capture organizational actor autonomy.
Innovation-Championing Strategies (ICS). Shane, Venkataraman, and MacMillan
(1995) investigated the relationship between cultural variables and innovation champion-
ing behaviors. Their DEMO scale includes an 8-item measure of group-level
autonomy (in addition to DEMO of cross-functional appeal and locus of support). The
autonomy items sample content such as making decisions outside the traditional hierar-
chy, bypassing standard operating procedures, and not having to justify every ﬁnancial
decision made.
Decision-Making Procedures (DMP). Taggart’s (1996) decision-making autonomy
scale assesses the decision-making authority held by subsidiaries of corporate parents.
Four levels of authority are DEMO from two dimensions (decision locus and input locus):
parent company decision without subsidiary input, parent company decision with subsid-
iary input, DEMO decision with parent company input, and subsidiary decision
without parent company DEMO
52 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Collective Role Breadth (CRB) and Collective Task Control (CTC). Sprigg, Jackson,
and Parker (2000) created a 10-item scale by modifying two different existing scales
(Jackson, Wall, Martin, & Davids, 1993; Little, 1988). The emphasis of the scale is on
collective DEMO and items are designed to assess team-level concerns such as the role of
the team in deciding work targets, work pace, and the DEMO of the team to discipline
other team members. Although the entire scale is not published in their work, the authors
readily provided it for our study.
Concerns Regarding Current Autonomy Scales
As our preceding review suggests, there are several established methods for measur-
ing group-level autonomy. For the DEMO of measuring autonomy in an EO context,
however, the major DEMO we surveyed have a number of shortcomings that suggest the
need to develop an improved measure. In general, current scales lack generalizability
across contexts, are sometimes indistinct from measures of (de)centralization, and are
often limited to measurement of structural autonomy without regard to strategic
autonomy. Each DEMO these concerns will be discussed later.
First, current measures often focus DEMO a particular industry or job in an organization,
thus limiting their use across contexts. Because our intent was to identify a scale that DEMO
be used in different types of organizations, context-speciﬁc scales were considered DEMO
isfactory. For example, the WGA (Gulowsen, 1972) was designed primarily to measure
the autonomy of low-technology traditional industries and lacks compatibility with
DEMO high-technology industries (Bailey & Adiga, 1997). Further, Bailey and DEMO
found that the hierarchical ordering of the WGA components does not ﬁt within certain
organizations. In comparing their proposed scale to that of the DEMO, they found that those
high or low in autonomy were identiﬁed DEMO both scales. The limitations of the WGA scale
speciﬁcally lie in those ﬁrms with a moderate level of autonomy.
Second, many of the current approaches to measuring autonomy lack distinction
between autonomy and decentralization. Although autonomy DEMO decentralization may be
similar, Brock (2003) argues that they differ DEMO imply unique organizational outcomes.
Autonomy refers to how much decision-making authority a person, position, or organi-
zation holds, whereas centralization refers to how concentrated decision making is in an
organization (whether situated in a single point or distributed throughout the organization
(Brock). For example, while DEMO Taggart (1996) scale is designed to measure decision-
making autonomy, DEMO actually measures which entity makes decisions versus what types of
decisions are made. The most commonly used scales often include measures of both
centralization DEMO autonomy. Researchers need to choose their operationalization based
on the theoretical grounding of their study, as (de)centralization and autonomy are often
not DEMO surrogates for each other.
Finally, a majority of existing scales focus DEMO on structural-level autonomy. With a
few exceptions (e.g., Hart, 1991; Shane et al., 1995), most scales focus exclusively on the
structural level while a few used a mix of strategic and structural approaches DEMO autonomy
(e.g., Gulowsen, 1972; Sprigg et al., 2000). DEMO noted earlier, the type of autonomy
suggested by an EO is DEMO strategic, that is, concerned with having the freedom and
independence to make decisions about entrepreneurial initiatives rather than simply
addressing structural issues such DEMO work hours, work procedures, or when to complete a
task.
Based on our review, we felt that none of the extant scales adequately assessed
autonomy from an EO perspective. Speciﬁcally, EO guides decision making and thus a
measure of autonomy as a dimension of EO should be DEMO in a similar manner.

Autonomy is not simply a way to design or structure a team, but rather a strategic
orientation reﬂective of an entrepreneurial climate. In viewing DEMO this way, we
believe existing scales fall short in their approach DEMO capturing the construct. In the next
two sections, therefore, we draw on insight from existing scales to propose an EO-based
autonomy scale and DEMO results from empirical tests of the proposed scale.
Methods
A key goal of this paper is to investigate and propose appropriate ways to measure
DEMO and to demonstrate that it is distinct from the other dimensions of EO. As an
aspect of the measurement issue, we are also interested in content validity, that is, the
degree to which our approach DEMO measuring autonomy reﬂects the theoretical content
domain of autonomy (Nunnally & DEMO, 1994). Establishing content validity is
typically achieved by ﬁrst rigorously DEMO the construct, then specifying a content
domain relevant to measuring the DEMO, and ﬁnally drawing a representative set of
items from that content DEMO and testing how they perform empirically.
To do so, we conducted DEMO exploratory studies using a set of items adapted from the
autonomy literature in conjunction with the most commonly used EO measures (study 1)
as well as some relatively new EO items (study 2). Then, we employed a content adequacy
assessment method developed by Schriesheim and colleagues (Schriesheim, Cogliser,
Scandura, Lankau, & Powers, 1999; Schriesheim, Powers, Scandura, Gardiner, & Lankau,
1993), which has been increasingly employed to demonstrate content validity and mul-
tidimensionality of organizational measures DEMO as work–family enrichment (e.g.,
Carlson, Kacmar, Wayne, & Grzywacz, 2006), beneﬁt system satisfaction (e.g., Williams,
Malos, & DEMO, 2002), personal learning (e.g., Lankau & Scandura, 2002), organiza-
tional culture (e.g., Bluedorn, Kalliath, Strube, & Martin, DEMO), and leader–member
exchange (e.g., Liden & Maslyn, 1998).
DEMO Pool Selection
The initial item pool was drawn from the scales discussed earlier. The goal of
preliminary screening (conducted by two of the authors) was to identify items that
reﬂected strategic rather than structural autonomy. As our earlier review suggested, there
was a preponderance of structural autonomy items, that is, those that emphasized issues
such as scheduling, work methods, and quality standards. Items that seemed appropriate
to an EO context were selected and adapted to a semantic differential format to be
consistent with DEMO EO scale items (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Lumpkin & Dess,
2001). Then, the revised item pool was shared with seven scholars who research EO topics
to obtain feedback about speciﬁc items. DEMO on their comments, we cut items and edited
the wording of DEMO to develop the ﬁnal set of items used in the two studies to be
discussed. The ﬁnal eight items (shown in Table 2) DEMO designed to be neutral with
regard to industry context and type of organization.

biases. This suggests that college students may be highly appropriate for analyses DEMO
the MSQ-S example presented earlier. They would be expected to have the capability
to read and understand the rating task instructions, items, and DEMO deﬁnitions.
In fact, it could be argued that the use of DEMO faculty, employees or managers in
an industrial setting, etc. might be less desirable, since such samples might provide
ratings which are affected by learned perceptual biases (e.g., from reading relevant
theoretical or empirical literature, or from organizational socialization processes)
(Schriesheim et al., 1993, p. 407).
Schriesheim et al. (1993) report virtually identical results across DEMO stu-
dents, MBA students, and nonstudent managers. Accordingly, using students DEMO are
naïve to EO models and their measures in our study is considered appropriate.
Surveys were distributed to 331 students across seven different business DEMO (four
undergraduate entrepreneurship classes, one undergraduate organizational behavior class,
and two MBA entrepreneurship classes) on the ﬁrst day of classes. Students were given
written and verbal instructions on completing the survey. A total of DEMO usable surveys
were returned (for a response rate of 96.3%). DEMO majority were currently working (51.1%),
with average work experience of 3 to 4 years. Their average age was 22.4 years; 62% were
male, and the majority were white (75.9%; 12.5% were Hispanic, DEMO were Asian, 3.8%
were African American, and .3 were Native American; .6% characterized themselves as
“other”). MBA students comprised 18.6% of this sample.
Procedure. Using the more cognitively simple yet robust procedure suggested by
DEMO and colleagues, respondents rated each of the survey items on whether DEMO
content described in the items represents innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness (DEMO
three most commonly used EO dimensions), or autonomy. We also provided a ﬁfth option
(i.e., “none of these”) if the respondents could not identify an EO dimension. The
deﬁnitions (derived from Lumpkin & Dess, 1996) and instructions given were as follows:
Please read each DEMO carefully and categorize it into the category of entrepre-
neurial orientation it best ﬁts, using the deﬁnitions we have provided below. Please
record your answer by putting an “x” in the appropriate column. Innovativeness is the
DEMO or tendency to engage in creativity and experimentation through
the introduction of new products/services as well as technological leadership via R&D
in DEMO processes. Risk taking involves taking bold actions by venturing into the
unknown, borrowing heavily, and/or committing signiﬁcant resources to ventures in
uncertain DEMO Proactiveness is an opportunity-seeking, forward-looking
perspective characterized by the introduction of DEMO products and services ahead of
the competition and acting in anticipation of future demand. Autonomy is the inde-
pendent action undertaken by entrepreneurial leaders DEMO teams directed at bringing
about a new venture and seeing it to fruition. Entrepreneurial behavior is often
generative and creative involving the autonomous actions DEMO organizational actors.
The content adequacy procedure has not previously been used for semantic differen-
tial response formats; therefore, the two anchor statements were DEMO into one (an
approach that increased our conﬁdence that the results DEMO yield robust information
about dimensionality).

Item Item
DEMO Autonomy Items:
*1 My ﬁrm supports the efforts of individuals and/or teams that work autonomously as compared with
requiring individuals and/or DEMO to rely on senior managers to guide their work.
2 My ﬁrm expects individuals/teams pursuing business opportunities to justify their actions throughout the
DEMO process (as compared with encouraging them to proceed without having to DEMO their
actions at every stage of development)
3 The top managers of my ﬁrm believe that individuals or work groups operate independently and DEMO the
organizational chain of command to get the best results rather than operating within the traditional
hierarchy.
4 The top managers of my ﬁrm DEMO that individuals and/or teams are most effective if their goals and
performance targets are set by their supervisor(s) rather than if they set their own.
*5 The managers of my ﬁrm believe that the DEMO results occur when individuals and/or teams decide for
themselves what business opportunities to pursue (rather than when the CEO and top managers provide
the primary impetus for pursuing business opportunities).
6 In my ﬁrm, individuals and/or teams are expected to use existing strategies and standard DEMO
procedures as a basis for decision making as compared with being encouraged to think “outside the box”
*7 In my ﬁrm, individuals and/or teams pursuing business opportunities make decisions on their own without
constantly referring DEMO their supervisors (instead of having to obtain approval from their supervisors
DEMO making decisions).
*8 In my ﬁrm, the CEO and top DEMO team (rather than employee initiatives and input) play a major
role in identifying and selecting the entrepreneurial opportunities my ﬁrm pursues
Innovativeness Items:DEMO
9 In general, top managers of my ﬁrm favor a strong DEMO on the marketing of tried and true products
and services as compared with an emphasis onR&D,technological leadership, and innovations (Covin
& DEMO, 1989)
10 In the last ﬁve years, my ﬁrm has marketed no new lines of products or services as compared with very
DEMO new product lines or services (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
11 In my ﬁrm, changes in product or service lines have been mostly of a minor nature as compared with being
quite dramatic (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
12 The top managers of my ﬁrm favor experimentation and original approaches to problem solving rather than
imitating methods that other DEMO have used for solving their problems (Lumpkin, 1998)
13 My ﬁrm prefers to design its own unique new processes and methods of DEMO rather than adapting
methods and techniques that others have developed and proven (Lumpkin, 1998)

Proactiveness Items:
DEMO In dealing with competition, my ﬁrm typically responds to action which DEMO initiate as compared
with initiating action which the competition then responds to (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
15 In dealing with competition, my ﬁrm is very seldom the ﬁrst business to introduce new products/services,DEMO
administrative techniques and operating technologies (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
16 In dealing with competitors, my ﬁrm typically seeks to avoid competitive clashes, preferring a
“live-and-let-live” posture (rather than a competitive “undo-the-competitors” posture) (DEMO & Slevin,
1989)
17 The top managers of my ﬁrm have a strong tendency to “follow the leader” in introducing new products DEMO
ideas (rather than being ahead of other competitors in introducing novel DEMO or practices) (Lumpkin &
Dess, 2001)
Risk Taking Items:
18 The top managers of my ﬁrm have a strong proclivity DEMO low risk projects (with normal and certain rates of
return) rather than high risk projects (with chances of very high return) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
19 The top managers of my ﬁrm believe that, owing to the nature of the environment, it is best DEMO explore the
environment gradually via careful, incremental behavior (rather than bold, wide-ranging acts necessary to
achieve the ﬁrm’s objectives) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
20 When confronted with decision-making situations involving uncertainty, my DEMO typically adopts a
cautious, “wait-and-see” posture in order to minimize the DEMO of making costly decisions (as
compared with a bold, aggressive posture to maximize the probability of exploiting potential
opportunities) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
21 The top managers of my ﬁrm prefer to study DEMO problem thoroughly before deploying resources to solve it
instead of being quick to spend money on potential solutions if problems are holding us back (Lumpkin,
1998)
Competitive Aggressiveness Items:
22 My ﬁrm is DEMO aggressive and intensely competitive rather than making no special effort to take business
from the competition (Lumpkin & Dess, 2001)

by the EO dimension they were designed to measure; other than the new autonomy items
which are described in the next section, the citation for the original scale from which the
item was drawn is provided DEMO parentheses following each item). Survey items were
randomly ordered in the questionnaire, and two versions of the survey instrument (reﬂect-
ing different DEMO ordering) were given to avoid order effects.
Autonomy. As shown in DEMO 2 and 3, item 1 is a general autonomy item developed
DEMO looking across the content of the research used to collect the extant scales. Items 2,
3, and 7 are based on content drawn from the Shane et al. (1995) ICS. Item 4 is adapted
DEMO the GPI (Little, 1988). Item 5 is based on content from two sources (Gulowsen,
1972; Sprigg et al., 2000). Finally, two items (6 and 8) are drawn from the GSS (Hart,
1991). Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 represent strategic autonomy; items 3, 6, and 7 represent a
mix of strategic and structural autonomy. All the items were worded to DEMO either the
ﬁrm or top management as the referent.
Innovativeness, Risk DEMO, and Proactiveness. The 9-item Covin and Slevin (1989)
EO scale was used to measure these three dimensions. This scale is commonly used DEMO EO
research, and prior studies have claimed it is psychometrically sound (e.g., Covin &
Slevin, 1986, 1989). These nine items DEMO in Table 3 as items 9 through 11 (innova-
tiveness), DEMO through 16 (proactiveness), and 18 through 20 (risk taking).
Analyses
Following Schriesheim and colleagues (1993, 1999), we ﬁrst computed DEMO number of
times the ﬁve categories were selected for each item to give a rough summary of the data.
These frequencies are presented in DEMO “frequencies” columns of Table 3. Next, we
conducted a Q-type factor DEMO on the data. Q-methodology is a means for quantita-
tively analyzing the subjective impressions of respondents who sort objects into theoreti-
cal categories for DEMO purposes (McKeown & Thomas, 1988). Subjects respond to
test stimuli by assigning scores with respect to their internal frame of reference. In DEMO
study, the stimuli presented to the subjects are the items to DEMO rated; the subjects’ internal
frame of reference is conditioned by the DEMO of the four dimensions of EO
presented to them.
The data matrix for our Q-factor analysis has K = 5 rows corresponding to the DEMO
of categories rated by respondents (four a priori EO dimensions plus DEMO “none of these”
category) and M = 17 columns corresponding to DEMO number of items. We computed the
correlations among the items, based DEMO each item’s frequency count for the ﬁve categories.
Next, we conducted DEMO principal components factor analysis using eigenvalue > 1 and scree
plot criteria for retaining the number of factors. We used Varimax rotation (because the
four EO dimensions are theoretically distinct). As is typical in these DEMO of analyses,
four principle components explained 100% of the variance (DEMO Schriesheim et al., 1993);
however, only three factors had DEMO greater than one, so we interpreted only a
three-factor solution (cumulatively, the three factors explained 96.0% of the variance). We
used the criterion level of greater than |.40| suggested by Ford, MacCallum, and DEMO (1986)
for identifying factor loadings relevant for interpretation. Loadings in DEMO analyses reﬂect
similarities in the way the raters assigned the items to the ﬁve predeﬁned categories.
Study 1 Results
We posit that EO includes DEMO separate autonomy dimension, and will be supported
empirically if two conditions DEMO satisﬁed: (1) the factor structure emerging from the
January, 2009
59
Q-type factor analysis identiﬁes an autonomy factor with high loadings on its DEMO and
small cross-loadings on the others (i.e., simple structure), and (2) the items identiﬁed in
the autonomy factor bear prima facie DEMO to each other and in their correspondence
to the conceptual deﬁnition of autonomy (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).
The frequency columns (Table 3, study 1) present the number of times a category was
selected DEMO a particular EO item; the factor columns present the factor analytic DEMO
The highest factor loadings are shown in italics. Items without data for study 1 were
included only in study 2.
Factor I. The set DEMO items identiﬁed by factor I in Table 3 represents the autonomy
dimension and includes items 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. These DEMO new items obtained the highest
frequency ratings on the autonomy dimension (DEMO from 27 to 46 ratings for this
category) and had their DEMO loadings on factor I (and no loadings greater than |.40| on
DEMO other factors). Loadings on factor I for these ﬁve items ranged from .83 to .99). The
content of these items reﬂects the DEMO priori dimension they were designed to measure,
involving decision making at low versus top management levels in the ﬁrm and the use of
DEMO in strategy and goal setting.
Factor II. The next set of items has content that represents risk-taking and proactiveness
dimensions of EO. Five items DEMO high rating counts for this dimension (of the items that
also DEMO clean factor loadings; items 14, 16, 18, 19, and DEMO, with loadings ranging from
.75 to .93). There were no DEMO greater than |.40| on any of these items. Unlike
the autonomy items, four of the items that loaded on this factor (items 16, 18, 19, and 20)
received their highest categorization in the DEMO of these” category (indicating that
respondents felt the content reﬂected none DEMO the EO dimensions deﬁned). Of these four,
the second highest category was proactiveness (item 16) and risk taking (items 18, DEMO, and
20). Item 14 had its highest frequency count for DEMO proactiveness dimension.
Factor III. As seen in Table 3, the content DEMO the items in this factor reﬂect innovative-
ness. Item 9 had its highest frequency count for innovativeness; the frequency count for
item 11, DEMO, was highest for the “none of these” category, with the second highest
frequency count for the innovativeness category. Factor loadings were .84 and DEMO (for
items 9 and 11, respectively).
Cross-Loaded Items. Five items (3, 4, 6, 10, and 15) all obtained substantial DEMO
(greater than |.40| on two or more factors). Three of DEMO items had their highest frequency
ratings on the “none of these” category, and a fourth had a fairly high frequency as well (item
DEMO). Item 3 had a high frequency count for the autonomy factor (on which it loaded), but also
demonstrated a substantial cross-loading on factor II. As a set, these mixed-content items
represented all the EO dimensions, including autonomy, except for risk taking.
Study 2
Study 2 DEMO conducted to replicate our results and to include the full range of
dimensions outlined by Lumpkin and Dess (1996): innovativeness, risk taking, proactive-
ness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. Because our exploration of autonomy DEMO
an EO context is theoretically driven, we wanted to be as DEMO as possible
in reﬂecting current conceptualizations of EO. As noted recently by Grégoire, Noël, Déry,
and Béchard (2006), there is a lack of agreement across the EO literature about the
construct’s dimensionality. The DEMO notable distinction lies between the three dimensions
60
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
used in study 1 (taken from Covin & Slevin, 1989) and the additional two dimensions
offered by Lumpkin and Dess. (Prior EO studies have used one-, two-, three-, and
ﬁve-dimensional conceptualizations and operationalizations of the construct.) While study
1 was designed to explore the autonomy dimension’s distinctiveness from the most
commonly used risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness DEMO, study 2 was
designed not only to replicate study 1, but to explore autonomy’s distinctiveness from risk
taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. Further, to be
comprehensive, study 2 also included additional items DEMO in previous research to measure
EO dimensions as indicated in further discussion.
Sample. Respondents were undergraduate business and MBA students in two large public
DEMO in the United States. Surveys were distributed to 133 students across six
different business classes (two undergraduate entrepreneurship classes, three MBA entre-
preneurship DEMO, and one MBA negotiation class; differences across classes were not
found). A total of 125 usable surveys were returned. Over half were DEMO working
(55.3%), and averaged 3 to 4 years of work DEMO Average age was 24.5 years old
(standard deviation = 8.0) and the sample was comprised of 71.2% males. The majority
were white (85.6%); 6.4% were Hispanic, 3.2% were Asian, 2.4 were Native American,DEMO
.8% were African American, and 1.6% characterized themselves as “other”). DEMO stu-
dents comprised 45.5% of our study 2 sample.
Procedure. The procedure for this study was identical to that employed in study 1, except
that we had a larger item pool (including items that were written to measure competitive
aggressiveness in addition to the dimensions explored in the DEMO study) which added a
ﬁfth rating category—compeititive aggressiveness. We again provided DEMO “none of these”
option if the respondents could not identify the type of EO behavior indicated. The
deﬁnition included for competitive aggressiveness was “the DEMO of a ﬁrm’s efforts
to outperform rivals and is characterized by a strong offensive posture or aggressive
responses to the actions of competitors” (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996).
Measures
Autonomy, Innovativeness, Risk Taking, and DEMO The same items used in
study 1 were used for study 2, plus four additional items. Two items developed for a
previous study (DEMO, 1998) were included (items 12 and 13 in Table 3) to address
important process aspects of innovation not captured by the Covin DEMO Slevin scale such
as experimentation and novelty. Item 17 was added to capture proactiveness content (used
by Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). An DEMO risk-taking item (item 21) from Lumpkin
(1998) was also included in the current study.
Competitive Aggressiveness. Looking at the item content of DEMO study 1 measures, we
expected item 16 (in Table 3) DEMO more accurately assess the competitive aggressive-
ness dimension, and wanted to DEMO this in our current study. An additional competitive
aggressiveness item—(#22 in Table 3), from Lumpkin and Dess (2001)—was also
included in the current study.
Analyses
We used the same strategy as study 1, ﬁrst computing the number of times the ﬁve
dimensions and “none of DEMO were selected for each item to give a rough summary of
the data. These frequencies are presented in the study 2 section of Table DEMO
January, 2009 61
Q-type factor analysis was then conducted on a data matrix with K DEMO 6 rows (number
of categories rated by respondents) and M = 22 columns (the number of items rated). Four
factors had eigenvalues greater than one, and we again used the > |.40| criterion for
identifying factor loadings as meaningful and relevant for interpretation. The loadings
shown DEMO the right-hand columns of Table 3 reﬂect similarities in the way the raters
assigned the items to the six categories.
Study 2 Results
The DEMO column in Table 3 presents the number of times a category was
selected for a particular EO item. The factor columns on the far DEMO present the factor
analytic results.
Factor I. The ﬁrst factor has item content reﬂective of at least two EO dimensions
(innovativeness and proactiveness). However, all ﬁve items that loaded on this factor had
the highest frequency counts on the “none of these” category, rather than on an EO
category. Items 9, 10, 11, and 15 had their second-highest counts on the innovativeness
dimension. Item 17 obtained the second-highest counts on DEMO proactiveness dimension
(this was a new item designed to assess proactiveness)DEMO Factor loadings ranged from .89
to .95, with no cross-loadings over DEMO
Factor II. All items that loaded on factor II were designed to measure autonomy. Each of
these ﬁve items (1, 3, 5, DEMO, and 8) had the highest frequency counts on the autonomy
dimension (and also obtained relatively low frequency counts for the “none” category).
Loadings on factor II ranged from .88 to .96. The set of DEMO was identical to study 1
except for item 3 (“The top DEMO of my ﬁrm believe that individuals or work groups
operate independently and outside the organizational chain of command...”), which
replaced item 2 on DEMO factor in study 1 (“My ﬁrm expects individuals/teams pursuing
business DEMO to justify their actions...”).
Factor III. Looking at item content in Table 3, we believe the third factor indicates risk
taking and/or proactiveness. One item (18) had its highest frequency count for risk DEMO
(along with “none”). However, a second item (21) obtained the highest number of ratings
on the proactiveness dimension (followed by “none” and then “risk taking”). The loadings
for these two items on DEMO III were .78 and .80, with no cross-loadings.
Factor IV. Only DEMO item loaded on factor 4 (item 14). This item clearly DEMO
competitive aggressiveness, with the highest frequency counts on this dimension (and a
factor loading of .91).
Cross-Loaded Items. Nine remaining items (items 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, DEMO 22) had
substantial cross-loadings (over |.40|). Five had high “none” ratings (items 4, 5, 16, 19, and
20). Four items obtained the highest number of ratings on the substantive EO dimensions.
DEMO 12 and 13 had the highest counts on innovativeness, item 2 DEMO its highest count on
autonomy, and item 22 had its highest DEMO on competitive aggressiveness.
Discussion
Autonomy refers to the ability to work independently, make decisions, and take
actions aimed at bringing forth a business DEMO or vision and carrying it through to
62
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
completion (Kanter, 1983; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Based on DEMO deﬁnition, autonomy in
an EO context is clearly a vital aspect DEMO entrepreneurial value creation and central to the
notion of strategic entrepreneurship. Autonomy may not be an issue among independently
owned and managed entrepreneurial ﬁrms DEMO such founders are already acting
autonomously. In a corporate setting, however, autonomy provides organization members
with the freedom and independence needed to pursue DEMO activities. The
autonomy of corporate entrepreneurs is not a given or held constant; instead, it is a scarce
capability that is granted to DEMO members, and cannot be assumed but must be
perpetually negotiated (Bouchard, 2002). In settings where it is encouraged and permitted
to thrive, research indicates that autonomy is an important element of new venture
development and growth (Burgelman, 1983, 2001).
Given the importance of autonomy, why have so few studies addressed the effect of
autonomy on entrepreneurial outcomes? One reason is that prior management research
has tended to investigate autonomy as it relates to work method issues such as production
methods, scheduling, or the physical layout of the workplace. An EO perspective on
autonomy, by contrast, suggests decision making and action outside of the DEMO
chain of command involving choices about entrepreneurial initiatives that have strategic
implications. Few existing autonomy scales address this type of autonomy. A key purpose
DEMO this paper, therefore, is to clarify the autonomy dimension theoretically as well as to
propose and test an EO-based autonomy scale.
Theoretical advances DEMO a ﬁeld depend on the existence of well-deﬁned constructs
and their psychometrically sound measures. This is particularly important for entrepre-
neurship research, which is currently in a signiﬁcant growth stage (Busenitz et al.,
2003), yet still suffers from deﬁcient construct measurement and research design in
some DEMO (Aldrich & Baker, 1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001). However, such short-
comings are not limited to entrepreneurship scholarship; scant attention DEMO psychometric
properties of scales is widespread as previous reviews on construct measurement in the
more general management domain have shown (e.g., Hinkin, 1995; Schriesheim et al.,
1993). Schriesheim et al. report that there is marginal attention paid to construct validity
(usually exploratory or conﬁrmatory factor analyses of respondents to measures), but
rarely was any form of DEMO validity assessment done (which is not focused on
substantive empirical relationships DEMO instead considers the item content domain of a
particular scale). Of additional concern to us in the present context is that the lack DEMO
attention to content validity is more apparent in studies involving macrolevel constructs
(e.g., no content validity checks were done in studies included in DEMO Schriesheim
et al. review of Strategic Management Journal as compared with the Academy
of Management Journal, which includes both micro- and macro-oriented studies).
These concerns provided a catalyst for this research. Our purpose was to DEMO
examine the distinct role of autonomy in EO processes and provide a ﬁrst step toward
developing a psychometrically sound measure of ﬁrm-level autonomy. The DEMO
objective was accomplished through the conceptual development at the beginning of
this article; the latter goal was addressed through our content adequacy assessment
studies.
Our analyses provide support for the content validity of our proposed measure,DEMO
suggesting that autonomy is a separate dimension of EO and not isomorphic with the other
EO dimensions. Our content adequacy assessment indicates that our DEMO often
eliminates troublesome scale items that we believe will yield ﬁnal scales that have factor
structures in subsequent empirical research that will be congruent DEMO the theoretical
construct dimensions of EO they were designed to measure. Across both studies, four
of the items we designed to measure autonomy sorted cleanly onto a separate factor,
January, 2009
63
providing a set of items (in italics in Table 2) that DEMO content valid yet warrant further
construct validation in future EO research.
Implications for Future Research
There are several contributions and implications for researchers from DEMO study. Based
on our theoretical investigation of different types of autonomy and the components of
different autonomy scales, we feel our efforts have yielded an important ﬁrst step in tapping
into the type of autonomy that DEMO relevant to EO research. While our content adequacy
assessment represents an advance over current practice and has yielded a content valid
four-item ﬁrm-level autonomy DEMO, this analysis is not a substitute for continued rigorous
construct validation. DEMO autonomy scale’s construct validation process should include
tests of discriminant validity and concurrent (or predictive) validity with other constructs
in the EO nomological DEMO, employing robust conﬁrmatory methods to both demonstrate
the multidimensionality of the DEMO construct as a whole, as well as reﬁne the measures
for DEMO individual dimensions. For example, as a result of the importance of DEMO
EO–performance relationship in prior research, the relationship between autonomy and
performance DEMO be investigated. Do higher levels of EO-based autonomy have different
relationships with performance? Is the relationship a linear one or might higher-order
models apply, implying diminishing returns from very high levels of autonomy?
Future validation studies should also explore potential context effects, looking into the
differences in autonomy for a corporate versus small-business or independent ﬁrm. Is
autonomy contingent DEMO organizational or environmental factors? What factors inhibit or
strengthen the relationship DEMO autonomy and ﬁrm performance? Finally, what is the
relationship between autonomy and the other individual dimensions of EO? For example,
is the relationship between autonomy and innovativeness actually curvilinear as suggested
by Gebert, Boerner, and Lanwehr (2003)? As an extension, our proposed autonomy scale
should be included in a composite EO scale to enable researchers to DEMO investigate each
unique dimension as it pertains to EO, as well DEMO to further research as it pertains to the
EO–performance relationship.
Our empirical ﬁndings regarding the other dimensions of EO are somewhat troubling
and provide DEMO number of research challenges. In particular, our two sets of analyses
DEMO a number of items with cross-loadings that indicate either problems in the
conceptual deﬁnitions of the EO construct or problems with scale items used DEMO often in
measuring EO, or both. We hope our ﬁndings regarding DEMO dimensions of EO discussed in
this study will spur the continued development of a more comprehensive theory of EO.
Future research should address the DEMO network and multifaceted relationships
of the effects of this important construct on various measures of organizational outcomes
and/or venture success as well as DEMO attention toward improvement in construct
measurement. Such an inquiry would represent a response to researchers who have called
on the ﬁeld to address deﬁciencies DEMO entrepreneurship research (Aldrich & Baker, 1997;
Chandler & Lyon, DEMO; Low & MacMillan, 1988; Wortman, 1987). In particular, DEMO
believe more cogent construct deﬁnition and clearer explications of the salient EO dimen-
sions would advance theoretical developments in this research domain. Further, we believe
our approach to examining the autonomy dimension provides a sound and DEMO approach
to future development of the EO construct and subsequent reﬁnement of its measures.
Implications for Practice
The ﬁndings of our study also have DEMO implications for entrepreneurial prac-
tice, both in new ventures and for DEMO with an EO in corporations. We believe it
64
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
is potentially problematic for researchers to prescribe speciﬁc interventions to achieve
organizational DEMO venture success based on a unidimensional conceptualization of EO.
A singular conceptualization could not distinguish between the effects of, for instance,
autonomy and innovativeness. If new venture failure is caused by a lack of autonomy DEMO
ﬁrm members, it is implausible to believe that it could be DEMO by an increased level
of innovativeness. In contrast, a conceptualization of DEMO with clearly deﬁned subdimen-
sions offers the possibility of prescribing more ﬁnely tuned sets of activities to deliver
speciﬁc new venture success outcomes. Because DEMO of the primary goals of measurement
is precision of prediction, a DEMO on an accurate understanding of the various dimensions
of EO can lead to clear, meaningful, and useful prescriptions for entrepreneurs.
Conclusion
Autonomous decision DEMO and action can provide a vital avenue for achieving
strategic advantages and entrepreneurial outcomes. Nevertheless, autonomy has received
less attention in prior EO research than factors such as innovativeness, proactiveness, or
risk taking. Our review DEMO the literature on autonomy has produced a reﬁned deﬁnition
for the construct as it applies in an EO context and a strong ﬁrst step DEMO measuring
this important entrepreneurial orientation dimension. We believe the ﬁner-grained elabo-
ration of this construct can help spur less equivocal and more relevant research DEMO
Although more work is needed to provide a robust, well-validated set DEMO measures for the
dimensions of EO and ensure greater consistency across studies of EO, the study provides
an important step in understanding autonomy and its relationship with new venture
success and organizational outcomes.
