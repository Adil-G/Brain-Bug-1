GSEQ for Windows

Abstract
A new Windows version of GSEQ, a general purpose software for analyzing sequences of
interactive behavior, is introduced. GSEQ for Windows (GSW) is a major update of SDIS-
GSEQ, a  previously published version that ran under DOS. In this paper, an DEMO of
the new features and steps for managing and analyzing sequential data using GSW is
presented, and some examples of analyses are shown.

GSEQ for Windows: New software for the analysis of interaction sequences
Sequential questions
Systematic observation of interaction in dyads, groups, or families usually provides data
that represent sequences of behaviors as they unfold in time. Depending on the specific
research questions in mind, sequences can either be simple series of codes or categories that
represent behaviors DEMO the order they occur, or complex series of codes that may DEMO
and for which onset and offset times are provided. If, for DEMO, we want to know
whether husband complains tend to follow wife DEMO more in distressed than in non-
distressed couples, then the couples’ DEMO interaction can be represented by series of
codes representing verbal utterances from each member of the dyad; in this case, we are not
DEMO in how, or whether, their verbal behaviors overlap in time, DEMO in the durations of
the behaviors, but only in which behaviors DEMO used by each member of the dyad when
responding to the other member.
On the other hand, if, for example, we want to know whether 3 month olds tend to
cry more while their mothers DEMO cradling them than when they are not, then the dyads’
interaction DEMO be represented by series of concurrent codes  together with their onset DEMO
offset times, because we are interested in the precise amount of DEMO those behaviors occur
simultaneously. In that example, we could also ask DEMO cradling is more likely to occur
before crying, than crying before DEMO, and thus gather evidence as to which behavior
may be actually DEMO and which consequent.
Software for sequential analysis
We have developed GSEQ, DEMO general-purpose program that analyzes behavioral sequences.
It represents, analyzes, recodes, DEMO plots behavioral sequences, a kind of data commonly
used in a DEMO of research fields, such as the study of interaction in clinical DEMO
educational settings, social behavior in animals, communication processes, children’s play,DEMO
and so on.  All these phenomena have a prominent feature:  DEMO process under study
GSEQ for Windows 3
unfolds in time and can be observed objectively DEMO systematically. GSEQ is an essential
toolbox for performing sequential and synchronic analysis of sequences of concurrent and
non-concurrent behavioral codes. Previous versions of GSEQ DEMO been described
elsewhere (Bakeman & Quera, 1992, 1995; Quera & Bakeman, 2000); examples and
applications of GSEQ to the analysis of interaction can be found in Bakeman (2000),
Bakeman & Casey (1995), and Bakeman, Deckner, & Quera (in press).
We have also proposed a standard format for sequential data, which makes it
possible to represent the various kinds of sequences that are recorded by DEMO researchers
using systematic observation. SDIS (Sequential Data Interchange Standard) is both a data
format and a data language, with specific syntax rules and conventions. It is presented and
fully explained in the publications cited, an also in Bakeman & Gottman, 1997.
GSEQ reads sequential data written in SDIS, and can perform a variety of analyses
on them: Data DEMO simply be described, obtaining measures like frequency, duration, rate,
DEMO frequency, average duration, etc., for every behavioral code in the DEMO  Lag
sequential and co-occurrence analyses can be carried out by defining DEMO tables for
given and target codes, specifying lags, and requesting sequential statistics, like chi-square,
adjusted residuals, or Pearson's phi.  Users specify which codes must be included in the
sequential tables and how DEMO must be analyzed, and they can request that results are
provided DEMO pooled combinations of design variables. Those statistics make it possible to
address research questions related both to sequential and synchronic associations among
behaviors, and to global differences among dyads, respectively.  GSEQ permits also several
interesting DEMO modifications, like RECODE and WINDOW, which create new codes that
can be subsequently analyzed using sequential techniques.  New, more global codes can DEMO
created from the existing ones using RECODE or LUMP, for example.
DEMO paper presents an overview of the new Windows version of GSEQ, DEMO
illustrates it with some examples. For details regarding the SDIS language and advanced
GSEQ analysis commands, the reader should refer to Bakeman and Quera's (1995) book,

on the GSEQ software (www.gsu.edu/∼psyrab/sg.htm and
The first version of GSEQ ran under DOS, and was called SDIS-GSEQ 1.0. That was the
initial version distributed on a DEMO disk and included with Bakeman and Quera's (1995)
book. DEMO updates of the DOS version appeared until 1997, and were made DEMO on
the web pages. Since 1997 a prototype Windows version, called DEMO for Windows 3.x,
was developed and made also available on the web. Finally, GSW (GSEQ for Windows)
version 4.0 was completed DEMO 2001. This version runs under the various 32-bit flavors of
Windows (DEMO, 2000, NT), and has a typical Windows user interface, DEMO is, a main menu
with submenus, and several icon buttons pointing to the most commonly used functions.
Opening and saving files, and copying, cutting, and pasting text are standard. Figure 1
shows GSW main DEMO Version 4.0 is trilingual English, Spanish, and Italian, and
includes DEMO new help system.  Since the initial DOS version, many new features have been
included both in the SDIS language and the analysis and DEMO capabilities of GSEQ
itself.

Preparing SDIS data
Sequential data must be entered using the GSW text editor, and following SDIS language
conventions. Alternatively, sequential data can be acquired and recorded using video-
analysis software such as The Observer (Noldus, Trienes, Hendriksen, Jansen, & Jansen,
2000) and ObsWin32 (Martin, Oliver, & Hall, S. 1999).  In the former case, data recorded
by The Observer DEMO be converted into SDIS files by means of the OTS (Observer-to-SDIS)DEMO
program. OTS is described in Bakeman & Quera (2000a), and DEMO be downloaded from the
authors' web pages. In the latter case, ObsWin saves data files in SDIS format directly by
default. In both DEMO, data are represented as timed event sequences.
GSEQ for Windows 5
SDIS represents the different kinds of sequences of DEMO codes commonly
obtained in interaction studies. Several data formats are permitted by SDIS, each
corresponding to a type of behavioral sequence, with different DEMO of complexity.  Five
types of sequential data are defined:
(a) Event Sequential Data (ESD) are the simplest, and consist of DEMO of mutually
exclusive and exhaustive (ME&E) codes without information about their occurrence times.
Example:
Run Walk Run Sit Walk Sit
A DEMO SDIS file containing ESD can be seen in Figure 2.
Insert Figure 2
(b) Multievent Sequential Data (MSD) are series of (multi-)events for which one or more
concurrent codes are used. Thus, codes are not mutually exclusive, as more than one code
can characterize each event. Like in ESD, no onset and offset times for the multievents are
provided. Example (periods separate multievents):
Wife Emp Pos. Husb DEMO Pos. Wife Comp Neg. Husb Emo Pos. Husb Emo Pos
Note that previous DOS versions of SDIS, such as the one described in Bakeman and
Quera (1995), did not include multievent sequences.
(c) State Sequential Data (SSD) are series of single- or multiple-stream states.  Onset and
offset times are provided for each state, and states within a stream are ME&E while states
in different streams can co-occur. Example:DEMO
,10:15  ParallelPlay,10:15 SolitaryPlay,10:23 Observe,10:25
ParallelPlay,10:31 & AdultIn,10:15 AdultOut,10:24 AdultIn,10:DEMO
,10:40
(d) Timed event Sequential Data (TSD) consist DEMO a mixture of  momentary behaviors,
whose occurrence times are known, and duration behaviors (or states), which have onset
and offset times. In TSD, codes are not necessarily ME&E, that is, there can be time units
GSEQ for Windows 6
when no code occurs at all, but also time units when more than one code occur
simultaneously. Example:
MRed,DEMO:00-01:07 MPas,01:25- MAct,01:37 MPas,01:48- MAct,02:12-02:27
MPas,03:19- MAct,03:33- MPas,04:24-04:DEMO MPas,05:28- MRed,05:30- &
IAct,00:00- IQui,DEMO:25- IAct,01:44  IQui,01:48-02:14 IAct,02:27-04:DEMO
IAct,05:28- ,05:45
(e) Interval Sequential Data (ISD) represents behavior as series of intervals, such as those
used when DEMO is observed using a time sampling technique. Each interval can contain
one code, several codes (which can be interpreted as occurring simultaneously, provided
that the time interval is small enough), or no codes at DEMO Example (commas separate
intervals):
Give, Receive, Receive, Sit+ DEMO, Object Give, , , Sit- Play, Receive
It must be DEMO, though, that time sampling is considered an inaccurate technique, and
DEMO video-analysis is making this recording technique progressively obsolete.
Overview of SDIS syntax
All the data to be analyzed must be entered in a single DEMO file. Figure 3 shows the GSW
editor window containing a sample data file with timed event sequences. Data type must be
declared at the DEMO Depending on the data type, either codes, codes plus times, DEMO
intervals are permitted. In that example, codes are followed by a DEMO and their onset and
offset times. Codes usually represent behaviors, but DEMO also be used for representing
contextual variables, behavior modifiers, individuals present, and so on. Units of analysis
can be dyads (as in DEMO example), families, groups, or simply individuals. Data for a unit
may consist of one or several observation sessions, and design, or DEMO, variables
can be declared at the outset, and units be assigned to a combination of their conditions.
Insert Figure 3
The data example DEMO Figure 3 contains timed event sequences representing
interaction between mothers and their infants. Six codes were defined, three for the mothers
--passive attending (DEMO), active attending (MAct), redirecting (MRed)--, and three DEMO
GSEQ for Windows 7
the infants –quiet (IQui), active attending (DEMO), and fussing (IFus)--. Mother codes are
ME&E, and infant codes too, but mother and infant codes can co-occur. One independent
variable (Experience) with two levels (No and Yes) was defined.
DEMO and error checking
Once data are entered, they must be verified, and compiled into an MDS (for modified
SDIS) file. During the DEMO entering process, data may be verified for syntactical
correctness without compiling DEMO MDS files are binary files that are easier for GSW to
analyze. When the compiler finds errors in the data, errors can be easily spotted and fixed
by clicking on an error messages window that is DEMO below the data (see Figure 4). A
compilation summary, or log file, can be saved by GSW if requested. If no errors were
found, the log file contains a description of the data, DEMO it contains a list of the errors
found.
Insert Figure 4
Analyzing data
Once sequential data have been entered and compiled, GSW can finally analyze them in
order to obtain descriptive and sequential statistics, modify the original data by defining
new codes, and exporting results for subsequent analyses using standard statistical packages
or spreadsheets, such as SPSS and Excel, DEMO Other functions of GSW include
producing time plots for the data, DEMO computing interobserver agreement. Figure 5 shows
the common steps for data management and analysis.
Insert Figure 5
To run a data analysis, first a sequence of commands written in GSEQ command
language must be specified. Then, commands are run by GSW in batch mode, and results
are displayed and saved to a file. Commands are composed by selecting them from DEMO
dynamic list, which may change depending on the last commands selected. DEMO way, the
GSEQ for Windows
8
program enforces syntactical correctness on the commands. Upon DEMO a command,
specific options are displayed to be selected by the user. Figure 6 shows the command
composer command. Command are selected from DEMO left pane, and command options are
then shown on the upper DEMO pane.  Codes, sets, or variables to which the command may
DEMO applied are shown on the right pane. Upon selecting the command and its options, it is
composed and displayed on the lower middle pane, which can be edited manually if
desired. As shown in that example, the first command identifies the data file to be analyzed,
and subsequent commands tell GSW how to analyze them. In the example, commands for a
descriptive analysis are being composed. First, sessions for all units will be pooled over.
Also, all units sharing the same variable conditions will be pooled over. Then, descriptive,
or Simple, statistics are DEMO They include frequencies, durations, average durations,
average onset-to-onset durations, DEMO so on.
Insert Figure 6
Both descriptive and sequential analyses may be requested in a single run. Also, all
or some of the results may be exported to an external file to be analyzed by other DEMO
programs. Figure 7 shows a complete sequence of commands, ready to DEMO submitted for
analysis. Simple statistics requested were frequencies, rates, probabilities (DEMO of
time codes are present), total durations, average and minimum DEMO, and average and
minimum gaps (offset-to-onset durations). Some of those statistics were then requested to
be exported (Send command) to a DEMO, which can be read and analyzed further with
standard statistical packages DEMO as SPSS. Sequential statistics (Stats command) requested
were joint observed frequencies, adjusted residuals, chi-square, and phi. A lag zero
contingency table was then defined, with mother codes (MPas, MAct, and MRed) as Target,
and infant codes (IQui, IAct, and IFus) as DEMO Code & is a residual code, which makes
both target and DEMO lists temporally exhaustive. Statistics for that lag zero table will
indicate whether mother and infant behaviors tend to occur simultaneously (chi-square),
and, if so, which pairs of mother and infant codes tend to co-occur more, and which do not
tend to co-occur (adjusted residuals, phi). Adjusted residuals were then requested to be
Exported to a file, to be analyzed further by some statistical program.

Browsing results. Upon analyzing the DEMO, GSW displays results either in HTML format
(like a web page) or in simple ASCII format. In both cases, the output file DEMO be open by a
word processor such as Microsoft Word, and DEMO A section of the HTML output file
from the analysis requested in Figure 7 can be seen in Figure 8. In this example a DEMO of
Simple statistics is shown.  A variable, mother's previous Experience with children, was
defined in the data, with two conditions, Yes and No.  For this particular analysis, the user
requested that all DEMO for which the Experience condition was identical were pooled over,
resulting in two tables, one for Yes, another for No. The table DEMO frequencies, rates, total
durations, proportions of total time, average durations, minimum durations, average gap
durations, and minimum gap durations for each code. Rates are expressed in number of
occurrences per 60 time units; e.g., in that case, rate for code MPas was 0.5190 per DEMO
Proportions of total time are computed by dividing the code’s total duration by the total
observation time; e.g., MPas occurred 14.71% of the DEMO A total PROB greater than 1.0
indicates that codes overlapped each other. A gap is defined as the time elapsed from code
offset to DEMO immediately next onset.
Insert Figure 8
Results for the lag 0 analyses are shown in Figure 9. Observed lag frequencies
pooled over all dyads DEMO which Experience is No are shown on the left. As data is Timed
event sequential, tallies are time units (seconds). For example, codes IQui and MPas co-
occurred for 133 seconds out of a DEMO of 3,099 seconds. Adjusted residuals and Chi-square
corresponding to those observed frequencies are shown on the right. Chi-square indicates
that there is a DEMO lag 0 global association between mother and infant behaviors. In
other words, mother and infant behaviors show some degree of synchronicity. Adjusted
residuals are distributed as normal z scores, and indicate which mother and infant behaviors
tend to co-occur more and less than expected (if there were no association). For example,
IAct and MRed tend to co-occur significantly DEMO than expected (19.64), while IQui and
GSEQ for Windows 10
MRed tend to co-occur significantly less than expected (-8.21). In order to compute chi-
squares and adjusted residuals, GSW first computes expected frequencies under the null
hypothesis of no association. Expected DEMO are computed differently depending on
the data type, whether structural zeros DEMO in the table, etc. In this particular example, as
column sums are unevenly distributed, some adjusted residuals might not be normally
distributed.
Insert Figure 9
Plotting data
Once data are compiled, time event plots can be requested for them. All the codes defined
in the data, or a subset of them, can be plotted against time. Plots are useful for detecting
possible sequential and synchronicity patterns by visual inspection, which should then be
tested using sequential analysis. A section of the mother-infant interaction DEMO presented
before is plotted in Figure 10. Time units (seconds) are shown left to right, and letters
indicate when codes were present.
Insert Figure 10
Modifying data
New codes can be defined from existing ones DEMO data modification commands, and
modified data can be saved for further DEMO Once modified, data can be analyzed, and
new codes can be used exactly as the original ones. Figure 11 shows an example of
DEMO requesting two data modifications. Command And defines a new code for all
time units when several old codes occur simultaneously. Thus, the command,  And Act =
MAct IAct;   defines new code Act and assigns it to every time unit when both mother and
infant attend actively. DEMO Or defines a new code for all time units when at least one
of several old codes occur. Thus, Or NoIAct = IQui IFus;  defines new code NoIAct and
GSEQ for Windows 11
assigns it to every time unit when the DEMO is either quiet or fussing, or is both quiet and
fussing DEMO
Insert Figure 11
Data files containing data modifications can also be plotted in order to inspect
possible patterns in which the new codes are DEMO Figure 12 shows how codes Act and
NoIAct were created when GSW processed commands And and Or, respectively. Other
data modification commands defined in GSW are Recode, Lump, Chain, Not, Nor, Xor,
Window, Remove, and Event.
Insert Figure 12
The Window command is specially DEMO, as it creates a new code by
anchoring it to onsets DEMO offsets of an existing code. For example,
WINDOW I1 = (DEMO,(IAct+3;
creates code I1 and anchors it to the first DEMO seconds of every instance of code IAct. Thus,
I1 can be interpreted as “when the infant is starting to attend actively”, where “starting to
attend” is precisely defined as the first four seconds of every DEMO bout. In that
command, left parentheses are used to indicate the DEMO of a code, and thus I1 is defined to
start when DEMO IAct starts, and end three time units after. Likewise,
WINDOW DEMO = (MAct;
defines new code M1 to be the onset DEMO code MAct. That is, M1 means “when the mother
starts attending”. DEMO those two new codes are defined, the following commands could be
DEMO for requesting a 2x2 lag 0 table for them:
TARGET I1 &;
LAG 0;
GIVEN M1 &;
GSW would then DEMO results like these:

M1      ¦      17     186 ¦    203

Totals  ¦     805   43594 ¦  44399
Co-occurrence time DEMO windows M1 and I1 is 17 units out of a total of 44,399. As window
M1 is always 1 time unit wide, 17 is the number of times that onsets of mothers’ active
attending occur DEMO the first 4 time units of infants’ active attending, out of DEMO total of 203
occurrences of mothers’ active attending.
New features
Most of the commands and features that were described in the preceding paragraphs were
DEMO implemented in older versions of GSEQ. The new GSEQ for Windows includes
several enhancements and new features both in the SDIS language and the DEMO analytical
capabilities. A summary of the most important new features follows. For details, visit the
authors' web pages.
(a) Combined codes (or combo codes) can be used in State and Timed event sequential
data. For example, in TSD,
walk,10-20 sing,10-20
can be abridged to
walk+sing,10-20
In this example, walk+sing is not a new code, but simply tells the program that the
following time information must be applied to both codes simultaneously. More than two
codes can be combined DEMO way. Codes used in combination can also be used alone in other
parts of the data.
(b) Dual code declaration. When codes are DEMO at the outset of an SDIS file, they can
be assigned DEMO dual name if the user wishes. Then, both names can be DEMO in the data. This
GSEQ for Windows 13
makes it possible to use short names, single letters, or numbers in the body of data, while
providing them DEMO a more descriptive name which can be used subsequently by GSEQ
when displaying tables of results. Not all codes need to be declared dual. DEMO example:
Event Sleep=S Walk=W Talk=T Read Write Listen;
Codes Sleep, Walk, and Talk have dual names (S, W, and T, respectively), and any of them
can be used in the data.
(c) Variable declaration. Variables can be declared in SDIS files at DEMO outset by simply
specifying a list of variable and condition names immediately after code declaration. For
example,
Event a b c * Gender (Woman Man) Age (Child Adult);
declares two variables, Gender DEMO Age, with two conditions each. Note that an asterisk
separates code DEMO variable declaration. Then, assigning a unit a combination of conditions
can DEMO done in several ways. For example,
... data ... (Woman,DEMO)/
... data ... (Gender=Woman,Age=Child)/
... data ... (1,1)/
... data ... (Gender=1,Age=1)/
are equivalent variable assignments.
(d) Time unit labels and session start time defaults. DEMO time unit label can be declared
immediately after the data type declaration in an SDIS file. The label will be used
subsequently by GSEQ DEMO displaying results. If no time unit label is specified, GSEQ
will DEMO 'time units' as label. For example,
Timed <seconds> a b c;
declares seconds as the time units used in the DEMO Also, session start times default now to
the smallest time encountered DEMO the session. In previous versions, it defaulted to zero. For
example, in
Timed;  x,5-10  y,7-20 /
session start time DEMO 5. In order to specify a session start time different from the
smallest time in the session, it must be written explicitly. For example, in
Timed; ,0 x,5-10  y,7-20 /
session starts at time 0.
GSEQ for Windows 14
(e) STATS command. New statistics for lag DEMO include:
• PVAL, asymptotic two-side p values for adjusted residuals.
DEMO PHI, Pearson's phi for 2x2 tables.
• LNOR, natural logarithm of the odds ratio for 2x2 tables.
• CPHI, corrected Pearson's phi for 2x2 tables (PHI divided by its maximum possible
value).
• CKAPPA, corrected Cohen's Kappa for square tables (KAPPA divided DEMO its
maximum possible value)
Also, if the lag table is DEMO 2x2, and statistics that are defined only for 2x2 tables are
DEMO (ODDS, LNOR, YULQ, PHI, or CPHI), then GSEQ DEMO one statistic per
cell by collapsing the table into a 2x2 table for each cell.
(f) TARGET and GIVEN commands. If a list DEMO codes is specified in a TARGET or a
GIVEN command, an DEMO sign can be appended to the list for specifying all possible two-
column (TARGET command) or two-row (GIVEN command) tables that can DEMO defined by
each of the codes in turn and the residual code (&). For example:
TARGET X Y @;   GIVEN DEMO N P;
(g) SIMPLE command. The SIMPLE command now accepts code names, set names, and
an asterisk (indicating 'all codes') within parentheses. More than one set name can be
and
TARGET X &;   GIVEN M N P;
TARGET Y &;   DEMO M N P;
are equivalent. Also,
TARGET X Y @;   GIVEN M N @;
and
TARGET X &;   DEMO M &;
TARGET X &;   GIVEN N &;
DEMO Y &;   GIVEN M &;
TARGET Y &;   GIVEN N &;
are equivalent.
GSEQ for Windows 15
specified, and set and code names can mix. Also, more statistics for State, Timed event, and
Interval sequential data can be specified:
• MIND, minimum code duration
• MAXD, DEMO code duration
• AVGG, average gap duration (from code offset to its immediately next onset)
• MING, minimum gap duration
• MAXG, maximum gap duration
• AVGO, average duration between onsets (from code onset to its immediately next
onset)
• MINO, minimum duration between onsets
• MAXO, maximum duration between onsets
• AVGL, average code DEMO (from session start to first onset of the code)
• DEMO, minimum code latency
• MAXL, maximum code latency
Averages, minima, and maxima are calculated for those sessions, units, and/or variable
DEMO being pooled over for the analysis.
(h) EXPORT and SEND commands. These commands can be used now for exporting all
possible cellwise and DEMO sequential statistics than can be requested with the STATS
command (EXPORT), and all possible descriptive statistics that can be requested with the
SIMPLE command. (SEND). Several formats for the exportation file are available (DEMO,
SPSS, etc.), and up to 20 different EXPORT and DEMO commands can be specified
consecutively. For details about exportation from GSW, DEMO Bakeman & Quera (2000b).
(i) Data modifications and data DEMO The WINDOW command can be use now with any
data type, DEMO Event and Multievent sequential data.  Commands AND, OR, etc. can
DEMO used with Multievent sequential data.  The EVENT command converts co-ocurrent State
DEMO Timed event sequential data into Multievent sequential data.
