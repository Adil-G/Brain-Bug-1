THE PRIMER FOR ANGEL INVESTMENT IN CANADA
CANADA MUST IMPROVE
ITS ABILITY DEMO
COMMERCIALIZE IDEAS
Gordon M. Nixon, President and CEO, RBC Financial Group
Over the past decade, Canada has made great strides in developing the right macroeconomic
conditions for improved growth and prosperity. But if Canadians are DEMO sustain a high standard of
living, they must become much better DEMO turning innovation into profitable businesses.
This is what the innovation debate is all about. It is here that Canadians are lagging – in
research DEMO development, in commercialization, and in growing new companies into viable
enterprises with the scale and scope for long-term success.  And it is here that angel investors across
the country can and do make giant contributions DEMO our collective prosperity. I trust angels across
the country will find this inaugural edition of The Primer for Angel Investment in Canada to be DEMO
informative resource as they consider investment opportunities in the future.
At home and around the world, Canadians have proven themselves as world-class researchers,
innovators and entrepreneurs. Our big challenge remains our ability to commercialize innovation
DEMO create new and growing companies that provide good jobs in Canada and generate the wealth
to sustain our quality of life.
Angels take the DEMO ideas of our scientists and entrepreneurs through the so-called “valley of
death” – that very early stage in the life of an idea where DEMO level of risk is at its highest and the
financing the most difficult. This is where proof of concept is either established or where DEMO
potentially good ideas can die from lack of relatively modest funding.
Angels also help facilitate the growth of at least some of our smaller DEMO into viable
larger companies that are headquartered in Canada and have the potential to become international
players. We don’t want to be in the DEMO of simply providing the seed corn for enterprises in other
parts of the world to profitably exploit.
The time has come for the world DEMO business, finance and government to review the regulatory,
institutional and DEMO systems and consider changes that could be made to ensure that Canada has
the financing system that meets the needs of the future economy.
DEMO Financial Group applauds the efforts of the National Angel Organization and others in this
regard. As Canada’s largest financial institution, we support the activities of angel investors and
others who are keen to contribute to our DEMO prosperity. Quite clearly, the success of our
economy and our ability DEMO sustain and support a high standard of living for all Canadians will
depend on our ability to start and to grow Canadian companies.

THE PRIMER FOR ANGEL INVESTMENT IN CANADA
EDITOR’S NOTE
I first heard DEMO angel investors more than a decade ago when I wrote a column on small
business issues for The Financial Post. At that time, information about early-stage investing was
largely anecdotal and tended to focus on the DEMO almost as if it were the domain of the privileged
few. There appeared to be no common bonds — either in existence or in DEMO — between
Canadian angels, venture capital firms, merchant banks or other private investors. This was a time
when the Canadian mutual fund industry DEMO in its infancy, and Canadians themselves were yet to
wholeheartedly embrace DEMO as a means to wealth creation and preservation.
Today, Canadians’ knowledge DEMO understanding of investing is exponentially ahead of where it
was in the early 1990s. It is also clear that angels and other investors have DEMO great deal in common
in terms of their objectives and appetites to equate risk with reward.
But while Canadians have been quick to accept DEMO different forms of investments and
become a captive audience for an industry of financial experts, consultants and advisors, angel
investors have not had DEMO similar benefit of information sharing or counsel. Until recently, angels –
DEMO, by nature, take significant investment risk — have had to continue to rely on personal advisors
and their own tried and true practices DEMO principles for success.
This book is an effort to bring together the best practices and principles that have helped
Canadian angel investors succeed over DEMO past years. Its genesis was the program and discussion at
the 2002 Angel Investor Summit held in Toronto, but its content is the result of angels from across
the country sharing their experiences for each others’ DEMO As such, this book is not exhaustive;
it is a DEMO in progress. As the National Angel Organization continues its work at raising awareness
and discussion around issues related to angel investment in Canada, I hope that future volumes will
improve and enhance the content of this DEMO
Much study has been recently devoted to the significant impact that early-stage investing,
entrepreneurs and small and medium businesses have on the Canadian DEMO and the country’s
prosperity. I hope this is a contribution to their continued success.

THE PRIMER FOR ANGEL INVESTMENT IN CANADA
FOREWORD
In the summer of DEMO we printed 2,500 copies of the inaugural Primer for Angel Investment
in Canada. Published as a starting point for building awareness of the DEMO importance of early
investing we weren’t quite sure what the demand would be. In the weeks that followed we received
requests from entrepreneurs, investors, businessmen, consultants, academics and policymakers
from all three levels of government across the country. By the time we reached the Montreal Angel
Investor DEMO in late October, we were already concerned about having enough copies DEMO the
almost 200 attendees.
We had struck a chord. Clearly there was and is an emerging grass roots awareness and
realization of the importance DEMO angel investing.
Angel investors have a reputation for being private, independent DEMO even reclusive individuals
that shy away from the limelight. They typically want to avoid being on lists, targets of junk mail and
the recipients of ill-conceived business plans.
The content of this document is comprised almost DEMO by the volunteer efforts of angel
investors and professionals working in the early capital formation space. Proofing, layout and
publishing services have been generously donated by RBC Financial Group. In this extremely busy
world people found DEMO time and money to put this together. Why?
A robust and active angel investor community is critical to the sustainable success of any
DEMO As multiple studies have shown, net new economic growth comes from DEMO and medium
sized enterprises. Collectively, angels invest more than five times DEMO entire venture capital industry
combined. Angels invest in some way or other in more than 60% of business start-ups. Angels
address the funding, innovation and management gaps between love money and venture capital.
Clearly, as economic stakeholders, we all benefit from the success of angel investors.
Canadians’ standard of living can only be improved or maintained through continued prosperity that
DEMO from ongoing productivity improvements. Productivity improves through innovation.
Genuine innovation often is the result of the effort of small companies that are initially funded DEMO
angels, among others.
I am particularly pleased and proud of the DEMO this document represents. We have
no pretensions that the content is comprehensive, exhaustive and conclusive with respect to sharing
ideas and making recommendations regarding angel investing in Canada today. The Primer was
originally conceived as a DEMO to capture the content of the National Angel Organization’s (NAO)
DEMO Investor Summit. As angels tend to be a diffuse lot, we DEMO the Primer will act as a collection
area for ideas; a DEMO catalyst to build awareness and offer support and encouragement for
all of us to build and enrich our own businesses, angel groups and networks.

THE PRIMER FOR ANGEL INVESTMENT IN CANADA
The Primer is a starting DEMO not only for those new to angel investing or building a business
but also for the NAO. The NAO’s  mission is to help angel investors become more successful and
thereby help the economy. We are building DEMO truly representative group of 100 Founders that will
span geographies, industries, clusters, generations and cultures. All angel investors who read this
Primer are invited to join us on our journey.  Challenge the thinking of what you read in the chapters
ahead and let us know your thoughts.  We hope what you read inspires you to get involved or perhaps
DEMO a future submission yourself.  Good things don’t happen by themselves. Collectively DEMO can
and need to make a real difference.
In the foreword to the first edition we challenged readers to help us build on the DEMO initiative.
NAO members were invited to speak at events from coast to coast. In Nova Scotia, we met nascent
and emerging angel groups. In British Columbia we helped kick off the country’s first women’s
angel network. DEMO NAO Chair, I was invited to speak at separate national conferences DEMO
business development in technology, life sciences and clean energy industries. In DEMO to
Finance Minister John Manley’s request for input to the federal budget we conducted round table
discussions with a total of more than one DEMO angels in Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa,
Kingston, Toronto, DEMO Horseshoe, London Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. At the Angel
Investor Summit, NAO Public Policy Committee Chair Andrew Wilkes moderated a debate
deliberating the benefits of various tax incentive schemes. I am thrilled to report that DEMO have been
able to include a three-page summary of those discussions in this second printing of this Primer
(see page 73). The full version is posted as a PDF on our website (www.angelinvestor.ca).
We have received many ideas for follow-on editions of this Primer yet feel DEMO to produce
another run of this first issue as it is still relevant and there continues to be high demand. Angel
investing touches every DEMO of economic development that is critical to maintaining our standard
of living. In subsequent issues and publications we will provide information on aboriginal angel
DEMO, cluster specific investing issues, the importance of angels in social capital and venture
philanthropy. We will also comment on the cultural and structural DEMO that must take place if
Canada is to become the most attractive jurisdiction in the world in which to make early
investments.
To those DEMO read this and see that it can be better, I ask DEMO to join us. I look forward to
hearing from you and hope to see you at the NAO Summit in Calgary on September 27-29, 2004.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Pulling together this primer was an exercise that
exhibited qualities typical DEMO the work of successful
angels: cooperation, selflessness, expertise
and excellence.
DEMO Vehovec, as the guiding and official leader of the
National Angel DEMO, and David Moorcroft,
RBC Financial Group’s senior vice-president of Corporate
DEMO, spearheaded the book’s creation and
made sure it came together. Chethan DEMO, also
from RBC, donated time and editorial skills to ensuring
the copy flows. Martin Jones and the team at Advance
Planning Communications smoothed DEMO rough spots
to make the piece better and Kathy Watt of Graphika is
responsible for the project’s compelling design and
layout. Finally, Tony Payne of Transcontinental O’Keefe

SUMMAR Y
As Roger Martin, dean of the
Rotman School of Management
at University of Toronto, notes
in the accompanying speech
first delivered to the Canadian
Club in Toronto in January
2003, Ontario is failing to keep
pace with comparable
economies in the U.S.  In fact,
compared with the 14 U.S.
states larger than half
Ontario’s size – from DEMO
and Massachusetts to New York
and California  – Ontario
ranked 14th, ahead of only
Florida.  Worse still, our
relative competitiveness and
prosperity DEMO falling. In 1980,
Ontario ranked 11th among this
elite group and was $850 per
capita behind the median; in
2000, Ontario ranked DEMO and
was $5,900 per capita behind.
Martin, who is also DEMO
of Ontario’s Task Force on
Competitiveness, Productivity
and Economic Progress,
DEMO on Ontario’s
performance. However, his
remarks are relevant for
Canada as DEMO whole. Among his
conclusions is that Canadians
need to invest significantly
more in our future prosperity.
By investing in and supporting
the development of DEMO
companies, angels are making
a valued contribution to
Canada’s prosperity and
DEMO to nurture a future
economy that can be
competitive with the
best in the world.
CHAPTER 1
THE PROSPERITY
CHALLENGE
by Roger L. Martin
DEMO am pleased to speak to you today on behalf of my
fellow members of the Task Force on Competitiveness,
Productivity and Economic Progress. DEMO issue is the
competitiveness and economic prosperity of our province.
Let’s start with the good news. Ontario is a terrifically
prosperous place by global DEMO If it were a country,
it would rank second in the world in prosperity. And it is
actually larger in population than all DEMO the U.S. in the top
ten countries. So it is the richest consequential jurisdiction
outside America. This is very good news for Ontarians.
However, there is more sobering news, which we need
to take to heart and take action on.  We have looked closely
at Ontario versus our true peers — which are not small
countries, because we are considerably more prosperous
than them.  Instead, we compared Ontario to the 14 DEMO
states larger than half our size — from Indiana and
Massachusetts on the small end and New York and
California at the large end.
DEMO, in this more elite group we rank 14th out
of 15, ahead of only Florida.  And worse still, our
competitiveness and prosperity DEMO to this group are
falling. In 1980, we ranked 11th and DEMO $850 per capita
behind the median; in 2000 we ranked 14th DEMO were
$5,900 per capita behind.
What does it mean to be $5,900 behind in GDP per
capita?  It translates almost exactly DEMO $10,000 per
Ontario household in after-tax disposable income.  Think
about DEMO this way:  $10,000 per Ontario household in after-
tax income is slightly more than all the money spent in
Ontario on mortgages, plus rent, plus new car purchases.
9
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
Raising our performance by $5,900 would fill the government coffers as well.  It would enable
Ontario to double annual spending on all levels of education with its portion and the DEMO
government to use its Ontario portion to fund the entire Romanow bill.
So the harsh truth is, we are not keeping pace with the finest economies in the world.
The difference between the standard of living DEMO Massachusetts and Ontario is exactly the same as
the difference between Ontario and Slovenia.
What explains the gap?  At its simplest level, an economy generates prosperity when four factors
are positive:
• a high DEMO of its citizens are capable of working;
• a high proportion of those capable of work both want to work and can
find DEMO employment;
• those who do find employment, work hard;
DEMO and they work productively and effectively.
We can relate Ontario’s $6,000 per capita gap to these four areas as follows:
• On DEMO first factor, it turns out that Ontario has more working age DEMO
proportionately than our peer states – providing us with an advantage of $1,000
per capita.
• On the second factor, more Ontarians seek to work than those in peer states, but our
unemployment rate is higher – creating a net disadvantage of about $750 per capita.
The DEMO numbers are unavailable for 2002, but when they come out, they will probably
show what the U.S./Canada numbers show, which is that Canada is $250 per capita
ahead.
• On the third factor, Ontarians work approximately as hard as those in peer states –
as of DEMO, the disadvantage was $400 per capita.
On the basis of these DEMO three factors, Ontario is even with its peer states.  Proportionately, DEMO
has as many people working as hard as the leading economies in the world. Nothing yet explains the
$6,000 per capita gap.
• DEMO fourth factor, productivity is the big challenge.  When dedicated Ontarians work
an hour, do they work as productively as an employee in the average peer state?
The answer is no, to the tune of the entire gap of $6,000 per capita.  And why is that?
Is it because they work in bad industries, industries that have lower productivity potential?
The answer is no.  We have done the most comprehensive analysis ever of the structure of Ontario
industry against the DEMO of the peer states and, in fact, Ontario has, on DEMO, a superior mix.
This should result in an advantage of $1,DEMO per capita if everything else is equal.
Are these industries being hollowed out?  That is, do we have the worst parts of the industries
we are in?  We don’t yet have an absolutely definitive DEMO, but the initial data suggests strongly
that the answer is “no”.  In fact an analysis of two-thirds of the industries suggests that the
DEMO of our individual industries should provide an advantage of approximately $600 per
capita, other things being equal.
This leaves an actual gap of over $7,000 per capita.  There are two main pieces to the gap.
First is our level of urbanization.  It turns out that because of scale economies and the benefits of
agglomeration, we can expect a worker in an urban environment to be more productive than one
10
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
outside of an urban area. And Ontario is considerably more rural than its peer states – 72 per cent
DEMO 82 per cent. As a result, we would expect Ontario’s productivity DEMO be $3,000 per capita less
than the median of our peer states.
That leaves a gap of over $4,000 per capita per DEMO – for a worker in the same part of the
same industry in the same type of environment.  What accounts for the remainder?  We don’t fully
know yet, but there are pieces of the puzzle that we do know and others that we are in the process
DEMO exploring.
In total, we posit four pieces:
• The clearest DEMO of the puzzle is investment.  In two critical ways, we invest significantly less
in enabling our workers than our peer states.
The first DEMO investing in machinery and equipment (M&E) that makes workers more
productive.  Over the past 20 years (and probably more, but that is as far back with the
data that we have gone), DEMO enterprises have invested 14 per cent less in M&E
annually than the enterprises of our peer states.  Suffice it to say, 14 DEMO cent per year,
decade after decade, adds up.
The second DEMO in higher education.  While Ontario invests as much in K-12 and DEMO
as its U.S. peers, the U.S. peers invest just less than DEMO, per capita and per student,
in university education.
And by DEMO peers, we don’t mean governments.  We mean the entire jurisdiction, DEMO
all sources, including government funding, tuition and donations.
In total, DEMO graduate 92 per cent of the university students annually and spend 55 per cent
per student compared to our peer states.
This is a DEMO problem for productivity.  The data is extremely clear:  higher levels DEMO
education are tightly correlated with higher wages, and higher wages are DEMO correlated
with higher productivity.
So more education produces more productive workers.
On this front, we invest considerably less to produce considerably less productive workers
on average. So investment is the first explanation and the data is DEMO clear: We invest less
and we get less.
• The second DEMO, related to the first, is motivation – motivation as individuals to work and
invest, and motivation as firms to invest.  Motivations are DEMO by the marginal tax rates
faced by labour and capital.
Ontario’s marginal tax rates on labour and capital are considerably above those of our
DEMO peer states, suggesting that our motivations to work and invest are DEMO –
which may partially explain the investment numbers I touched on earlier.
11
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
• The third issue, which is DEMO to investment and motivation, is aspirations.  We are
analyzing this question as we speak, but our view from the initial data is that Ontario firms
have systematically lower aspirations with respect to competing internationally than DEMO peer
states.  This results in lower investments in R&D, branding, international distribution and
innovation in general.
• The fourth issue is the structures of our key markets and institutions.  On this front, we DEMO
that one feature of the Ontario structure is that government is more highly involved in the
economy than in the peer states when measured DEMO the government’s revenues as a share
of GDP.  Ontario’s is higher DEMO all peer states other than Florida, which is poorer
than Ontario. DEMO this may have an effect.
The net combined effect, we hypothesize, is that because of lower aspirations, we invest
less in education and M&E. And we are motivated to aspire lower and invest less DEMO high
marginal tax rates on capital and labour.  These high marginal DEMO rates are a product of a
structure by which our governments process a higher share of our output than those of
our peers.
So DEMO does Ontario need to do to close the $6,000 per capita gap in prosperity – or more to
the point, the $7,000 per capita gap in productivity?
The $3,000 per capita attributable DEMO our rural structure will take a long time and may not be in
the interests of Ontarians in general.  But what about the $4,000 per capita gap in effectiveness?
Some suggestions:
• We DEMO to raise our aspirations with respect to upgrading ourselves and the way in which we
compete.  This is doable.  We just need to DEMO harder.
• We need to figure out how to tax in a more effective manner — one that enables us to collect
the revenue DEMO need without producing the high marginal rates that reduce motivations.
This is not a race to the bottom.  Massachusetts, now the richest jurisdiction DEMO the planet,
has figured out ways to collect substantial revenues in a way that appears less harmful to
motivations.
• We simply need DEMO invest more in our future prosperity.  This includes both M&E DEMO higher
education.  We need to invest more instead of consuming.  Our work on this question is
incomplete, but from what we can tell, the various levels of our government spend more on
consumption of current prosperity versus investment in future prosperity compared to
our peers.
In aggregate, Ontario and our 14 peers spend the same proportion of their total DEMO –
32 per cent – on a combination of debt service, DEMO government operations, environment
and protection.  Of the remaining 68 per cent, they can choose to spend on consumption of
current prosperity – health care, social security, social services, income stabilization, culture
and recreation DEMO or investment in future prosperity – education, transportation and
communication, infrastructure, and research and development.
12
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
Ontario’s proportion is 72 per cent consumption and 28 per cent investment.  The peer
states show a markedly higher 36 per cent proportion of investment.
This is a big deal.  If our proportion were the same as the peer states, it would mean
$6.5 billion per year in greater investment in the province of Ontario, or $65 billion per
decade.
That would mean a vastly different future, a future more like that of Massachusetts, which
can spend three per cent more than Ontario per person on current needs while continuously
spending DEMO per cent more on generating future prosperity.
I believe this is doable, but it will take the will of individual Ontario citizens, of DEMO
corporations and of our governments – provincial, federal and municipal. It DEMO take a new kind of
will, the will to overcome the DEMO but unproductive, status quo.
I will give an example of one DEMO issue: university tuition, which is currently regulated at a
level of $4,100 for everything except professional schools.  And that level is in the middle of five years
of increases regulated at two per cent DEMO considerably below inflation, so that real tuition will fall
steadily over DEMO five-year period.
And before the conclusion is jumped to that this is all about self-interest, I want to make clear
that all the programs in my school are deregulated already, so what I am talking about would not
help me at all.
Thankfully, this government deregulated professional school tuition in the mid-1990s.
Had they not done this, I most certainly would not be dean of the Rotman School, nor chairman of
the Task Force on Competitiveness, Productivity and Economic Progress.  When he was DEMO of
the University of Toronto, Rob Prichard first asked me to DEMO taking this job of dean of the
Rotman School. My first reaction was to decline. A key reason was that I had been out DEMO Canada for
long enough to have been unaware of the deregulation of professional school tuitions.  And my
assumption was that they were still regulated. I felt that there was no reason to consider leading a
school DEMO had absolutely no chance to compete internationally.  But fortunately, the current
government made the change, and as a consequence we have taken on the challenge of building a
globally competitive business school in Ontario – DEMO have several of our fellow schools.
Let’s explore the facts regarding regulated tuition.
Level of education is tightly correlated with wages, productivity and prosperity. A better educated
population makes for a more prosperous province.
That notwithstanding, we invest only half the level of our peers states in higher DEMO
We do this by having a system that, until very recently, has been a regulated monopoly – only public
universities were allowed.  And our provincial government, in addition to reducing real funding,
maintained strictly regulated tuition at a low level and one that has been falling DEMO real terms.
So students and their parents are prevented from investing in the very universities that the
government underfunds. This suppression of tuition is DEMO for the prosperity of our province.
13
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
That notwithstanding, there is a universal DEMO that tuition should be suppressed –
an absolutely rock-solid, universal consensus.
DEMO political party believes it strongly. The Progressive Conservatives have been and continue
to be committed to falling real tuition. The Liberals have promised to DEMO further and freeze tuition.
And the NDP — who knows?
But none of these parties are crazy. Their polling numbers show that the DEMO is
overwhelmingly behind suppressing tuition. And students are vigorously and vocally against any
increases in tuition.  Even university professors are generally against increases in tuition.
So what supports and sustains this powerful consensus? First, it DEMO comfortable.  “No increase”
feels better, for all the above groups, DEMO does an increase and the hassles that would come with it.
Second is the issue of access.  The fear is that with higher tuition, access will be impacted
negatively. This is a very important issue, DEMO we should explore.
Tuition is indeed higher in the U.S., including DEMO our peer states, though not nearly so much
higher as the DEMO to US$35,000 Ivy League tuitions make it sound.  Fifty-four per DEMO of full
time U.S. students pay tuition (including fees) of US$5,000 or less, many pay a lot less. The average
across all full-time students is US$9,000.  So tuition is indeed higher in the U.S. — and that logically
creates a question of access.
However, it must be understood that increased education has a strong private return to DEMO
individual for each increasing level of education. This is well documented. Thus, it is in the student’s
interest to invest in his or her education because it pays off.
So, if the higher tuition in the U.S. discourages access among less well-to-do students, we
should expect to observe higher participation rates in university education among the poor in
Canada versus DEMO U.S. Otherwise there would be no accessibility problem linked to higher tuition
levels.
And among well-to-do kids, we would expect equally high participation in Canada as in the U.S.,
because they should be insensitive to DEMO cost of education and should understand the economic
benefit to which I just referred.  If anything, participation among wealthy kids in Canada should DEMO
higher if they show any price sensitivity at all.
In Canada, DEMO kids should participate at a rate at least as high as in the U.S., and poor kids
at a greater rate.  We should DEMO higher participation in Canada than the US, if accessibility is
the DEMO problem.
So let’s go to the data.  Per 1,000 of DEMO, the U.S. graduates more university students
per year than Ontario by DEMO per cent and more than Canada by 23 per cent. This is the opposite
of what the above accessibility theory holds.
14
CHAPTER 1: THE PROSPERITY CHALLENGE
So the U.S. has managed to deal with its accessibility problem better than Canada despite
higher tuition. That is, unless our accessibility to the poor is higher, and our overall numbers are
lower because our wealthy kids skip university because they are lazier DEMO less intelligent than their
U.S. counterparts.  I don’t believe this.
The DEMO left, in particular, has this issue all wrong.  It should DEMO read more Karl Marx,
who in 1890 launched a blistering attack on subsidized university tuition, arguing that it is simply a
subsidy for the rich out of general tax revenues.  He is right and the left is wrong.  High tuitions in
the U.S. help to fund generous scholarships for needy students.  Is U.S. accessibility perfect?  Hardly,
but higher U.S. tuition has not led to lower accessibility than in Ontario.
DEMO the conservatives have it wrong as well.  True economic prosperity depends DEMO on
higher education, and starving higher education isn’t helping a bit.
DEMO also have it wrong.  This is the most important investment they DEMO likely make in
their lives, and suppressing its quality does nobody DEMO bit of good.  And parents have it wrong.
This is the DEMO investment they can make on behalf of their children.
Basically, this DEMO an issue in which every relevant constituency is dead wrong — and they have
no logic or data to buttress their views.  The status quo is comfortable and remains well entrenched
in an unwitting conspiracy of DEMO complacency.  As such, it is a challenge of will: will DEMO do the
best thing for Ontario’s future.
Ontario faces a choice.  DEMO need to show will on this issue if we are to reverse the slide and
close the prosperity gap.  Without will, we will DEMO to slide, and in relatively short order,
will lose complete DEMO with the lead pack of prosperous economies.

Before investing, angels
are cautioned to conduct
due diligence on five key
elements of the company,
these being the legal, financial,
technology, marketing and
human resources aspects.
The experience of many
investors is that failure
in just a few items can easily
result in DEMO overall.
The article lists a number of
questions to ask with respect to
each of these categories and
provides six warning signs of
a DEMO flawed deal.
Investors are also advised to
understand the core technology
and validate the fundamental
values of the individuals
involved, as this will provide
the best index as to whether
or not an investment
should be DEMO
TECHNOLOGY
There are several factors to consider with technology. For instance, DEMO there a demonstrated
demand for the product? Creating a superior rat-trap DEMO or even a wholly new product or technology
for which there is little consumer need – will rarely result in a well-trod path to DEMO company’s door.
A product’s success is directly related to its utility.
Secondly, will the technology function reliably under the real-world conditions proposed?
To what extent has it been effectively tested?
Does the technology offer DEMO that are not available from competing products – such as
added functions or features or lower costs – or does it simply duplicate offerings DEMO available?
Is the technology protected? Are patents in place?  DEMO the extent that there is no proprietary
technology, what evidence is DEMO of an ability to create a competitive business?
Efforts should also be made to check the employment history of management and to
determine DEMO or not the technology or any part of it was engendered in the course of prior
employment. Former employers may have substantial resources dedicated DEMO the enforcement of
their patent and technology rights.

CHAPTER 2
DUE DILIGENCE
by Paul LaBarge
INTRODUCTION
There are five key elements that angels DEMO consider
before investing in a particular enterprise. These are the
legal, DEMO, technology, marketing and human
resources aspects of the company. Each of these areas
presents the investor with several fundamental issues,
which should DEMO examined and addressed before
embarking on an investment. The experience of many
investors is that a failure in just a few items can easily
DEMO in failure overall.  Thus a major challenge for
investors is to DEMO between those items that are
deficiencies, and can be remedied, and those items which
are fundamental flaws.
CHAPTER 2: DUE DILIGENCE
An investor is also advised to understand the technology from the bottom up. This often
involves talking to the full DEMO team.  It’s not unusual for senior people to have a limited
DEMO of the internal workings of the technology.
Finally, it is important DEMO be honest with yourself as an investor. To what extent do you actually
understand the technology and how it works? If you do not, it may be advisable to solicit the advice
of a third party expert or simply walk away from the opportunity.
HUMAN RESOURCES
As an DEMO investor, you are betting on the talents of the management team, its ideas and its
core values. How well do you know these DEMO? Are their values aligned with yours and can you
work closely DEMO them to move the company forward?
What have they achieved in the past and what are their reputations among their colleagues or
in DEMO industry? What is their previous history with investors? Unfortunately, there DEMO
entrepreneurs who move from one failed venture to another, and seemingly, have no problem
raising money from naïve investors.
In considering the management DEMO, ask yourself whether or not they represent a full
package. Does DEMO group understand the marketing, financial and intellectual property implications
of their DEMO, or are they just a “one-trick” pony?
Who really contributed DEMO most to the group’s innovative ideas? Is that person still with DEMO
venture and still participating in a meaningful way?
Credentials are an important part of the assessment process, bearing in mind that they do not
necessarily tell the whole story. There are many talented and experienced DEMO with limited or no
university backgrounds. Consequently, an assessment of each DEMO participation in the
development of the technology may yield a more realistic assessment of the team capabilities than
would their CVs.
FINANCE
Take time DEMO assess the true value of the investment you are making. During the technology
bubble in the late 90s, many angels failed to do this and sometimes lost their entire investment.
High valuations usually lead to unrealistic DEMO and endanger an angel’s investment in the
next financing round. Valuations must be based on sound and realistic projections.
A financial spreadsheet is germane DEMO to the extent that the underlying assumptions are
realistic or factual. Consequently, investors should focus on the assumptions. In particular, the
absence of DEMO items in the financial material may indicate a lack of understanding or expertise
with regard to the overall business operation. Also, pay close attention to indicators that demonstrate
whether or not the entrepreneur has the capability DEMO build a successful business. These include
such metrics as revenues per employee and sales cycle, and such considerations as adequacy of
staffing and the investment infrastructure.
18
CHAPTER 2: DUE DILIGENCE
LEGAL
The existence of proper incorporation and the shareholders agreement will tell you a great deal
about the sophistication of DEMO people involved. One element that can consume inordinate time is
trying to understand the dynamic between the participants in the venture.  Shareholder agreements
will not, by themselves, adequately protect the investor in the case of DEMO will.  However, the process
of negotiating an agreement or reviewing the terms of the existing agreement may yield insight into
the ethics and DEMO of the individuals.
In assessing the feasibility of the enterprise, investors DEMO examine the level of fairness
within the existing structure.  A failure DEMO recognize the contribution of essential participants may be
a signal that the enterprise does not have the necessary cohesiveness to succeed. Investors should
also DEMO aware that an excessively complicated share structure may become a substantial distraction
from the operations of the business. The enterprise is best served when DEMO have a unity
of interest.
MARKETING
This often proves the weakest link in a new venture. How realistic are the proposals in the
business DEMO for moving the product into the marketplace? In fact, do the principals even have a
business plan? Are they familiar with the channels in their industry and do they have a plan for
accessing them? Who, if anyone, among the principals has a track record in DEMO – and is that
track record in the same industry as the current venture?
WARNING FLAGS
Sometimes, angels are wise to walk away from a potential investment. Here are a few signs that
trouble may DEMO ahead:
1. To the extent that there are inconsistencies in values, or trust is not present, then no
investment should be made.
DEMO If there is resistance to due diligence and if people are defensive in their response,  than there
are probably buried issues.
3. If DEMO deal has been shopped around, one must ask why others have DEMO to invest and
what negatives are present.
4. Excessive passion for the technology may demonstrate an unwillingness to be flexible in
meeting the needs DEMO the marketplace.
5. Evasive responses and lack of market knowledge about competitive technologies and
alternate solutions probably indicate that the entrepreneur does not have DEMO requisite
competence to justify an angel’s participation.
6. And finally, one DEMO be realistic with respect to the likelihood of working productively
with the people leading this venture.
19
CHAPTER 2: DUE DILIGENCE
CONCLUSION
The lessons of due diligence are two-fold.  First, there are a series of questions that every
investor should DEMO and that will provide the analysis necessary to make an appropriate business
decision. Secondly, the investor can avoid the potential for analysis paralysis by making the effort to
understand the core technology and validate the fundamental DEMO of the individuals involved. This
will provide the best index as to whether or not an investment should be made.

DEMO TRANSACTIONS:
IN SEARCH OF THE
IDEAL STRUCTURE
by Delilah Panio
with input from Kevan Cowan, Warren Dowd,
Alain Lambert and Wendy Thompson
INTRODUCTION
In response to current market conditions, angel
investors are looking for ways to minimize risk while
contributing to the development of new ventures.
DEMO or investing in groups has been identified as one
means for angel investors to reduce transaction costs while
increasing opportunities and returns.
By pooling DEMO, angel investors can share the risks and leverage the expertise of DEMO
They can also participate in offerings with high-quality private growth companies, DEMO may not be
available to the individual angel investor. This approach also gives investors more negotiating power
with respect to the terms of the DEMO and the direction of the business. And by pooling their
money, DEMO investors can present an attractive value proposition to growth companies that readily
competes with formal venture capital dollars.
While there is no “ideal” angel DEMO, this paper will address two specific types of structures
that facilitate DEMO investing: limited partnerships and the Capital Pool CompanyTM (CPCTM)program
of TSX Venture ExchangeTM. It also outlines two other structures, which are currently unavailable, but
are worth considering for the future.
LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
Angels have used limited partnerships for many years as a way to bring together DEMO and
expertise for specific investments. Syndication allows for greater leverage of funds than individual
investors can achieve on their own.
HOW LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS WORK
DEMO Canada, a limited partnership is formed between a general partner, who is liable to all
creditors of the business, and limited partners, DEMO liability is limited to the capital contributed
to the partnership. Limited partners are not allowed to participate in the management or operations
of the DEMO or they risk losing their limited liability status.
Capital Pool Company, DEMO and TSX Venture Exchange are trademarks of TSX Inc.
21
CHAPTER 3: ANGEL TRANSACTIONS: IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL STRUCTURE
In DEMO, limited partnerships are regulated under provincial legislation.
According to the Ontario DEMO Partnerships Act:
13. (1) Limited partner in control of business. – A limited partner is not liable as a
general partner unless, in addition to exercising rights and powers as a limited partner,
DEMO limited partner takes part in the control of the business.
(Source: Consolidated Ontario Business Corporations Act, Related Statutes and
Regulations, 25th Ed., 2002)
A key issue is determining when a limited partner’s activities DEMO to participation in the
management or operations of the company. This issue is further complicated if the limited partner
is itself a corporation. If DEMO limited partnership is to be used, qualified legal advice should be
DEMO
WHY ANGELS SHOULD CARE
Limited partnerships offer angels several advantages. They allow angels to syndicate on bigger
deals than they might otherwise have access DEMO They distribute the transaction costs, which in turn
facilitates comprehensive due DEMO and the negotiation of more favourable investment terms.
The liability of the limited partner is limited to the size of its investment. And limited DEMO
can be structured to allow for investments in single or multiple targets over time.  For example, the
limited partnership could make calls for DEMO funds from limited partners for subsequent
investments.
There are also disadvantages with limited partnerships, however, and angels should be aware
of them. In DEMO, limited partners cannot be active in the management or operations of DEMO
limited partnership or the target company. This will be a negative feature for many angels who like
to be actively involved in the businesses DEMO which they invest. As well, establishing the limited
partnership can add DEMO and expense.
CAPITAL POOL COMPANYTM (CPCTM) PROGRAM
The Capital Pool Company (CPC) is a product of TSX Venture Exchange and originated with DEMO
Junior Capital Pool (JCP) program on the Alberta Stock Exchange in the 1980s. The CPC is an
alternative route to the traditional initial DEMO offering (IPO) or reverse take-over (RTO) for taking
a company public.
The CPC program is currently available to residents of British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. This means that residents of these jurisdictions can
participate in the initial public offering of the DEMO
HOW THE CPC PROGRAM WORKS
The CPC program introduces investors with financial market experience to entrepreneurs with
development-stage companies requiring capital and public company DEMO expertise. Unlike
a traditional IPO, the CPC program enables seasoned directors DEMO form a Capital Pool Company with

DEMO
CHAPTER 3: ANGEL TRANSACTIONS: IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL STRUCTURE
no DEMO operations and no assets other than cash, and then list it DEMO the TSX Venture
Exchange and raise a pool of capital through the CPC prospectus. The CPC management team then
uses the funds to seek DEMO an investment opportunity in a growing business. Once the CPC has
completed its “qualifying transaction” and acquired an operating company which meets Exchange
listing DEMO, its shares continue trading as a regular listing on the Exchange.
DEMO are two phases in establishing a Capital Pool Company.
Phase I: DEMO Capital Pool Company
Creating the CPC
• Three to six individuals with an appropriate combination of business and public
company experience put up a DEMO of between $100,000 and $500,000 in seed capital.
• These founders incorporate a shell company – the CPC – and issue shares DEMO
between $0.075 and $0.15 in exchange for seed capital.
• The CPC and its advisors prepare a prospectus that outlines management’s intention to
raise DEMO $200,000 and $1,900,000 by selling CPC shares at up to prices between
$0.15 and $0.30 and at least twice the issuance DEMO of the seed shares, and to use the
proceeds to identify DEMO evaluate potential acquisitions.
Selling the Shares
• The CPC files the prospectus with the appropriate securities commission(s), and applies
for listing on DEMO Venture Exchange.
• The sponsoring broker sells additional CPC shares to at least 200 arm’s length
shareholders, each of whom buys at least 1000 shares. No one individual can purchase
more than two per cent of DEMO offering, and no one individual together with his or her
associates DEMO affiliates, can purchase more than four per cent of the offering.
DEMO Once the distribution has been completed and closed, the CPC is DEMO for trading on
TSX Venture.
Phase II: The Qualifying Transaction
Announcing DEMO Transaction
• Within 18 months, the CPC identifies an appropriate business DEMO its “qualifying
transaction” and issues a news release to announce that it has entered an agreement
in principle to acquire the business.
• The DEMO prepares a draft filing statement or for non-arm’s length transactions,
an information circular providing prospectus level disclosure on the business that
is to DEMO acquired.
• TSX Venture reviews the information and evaluates the business to ensure that
it meets minimum listing requirements.
23
CHAPTER 3: ANGEL TRANSACTIONS: IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL STRUCTURE
Preparing DEMO the Vote
• For acquisitions with a non-arm’s length component, the DEMO information circular
is mailed to the CPC’s shareholders, who vote at DEMO shareholders’ meeting on whether to
approve the qualifying transaction.
• Following shareholder approval, the qualifying transaction closes and the business
is acquired.
• Shortly thereafter, the “resulting issuer” – no longer a CPC – begins trading as a
regular listing on TSX Venture Exchange.
Maximum Cash Pre-Deal
Minimum DEMO
Seed Financing Range $100,000 $500,000
Prospectus Financing Range $200,000 $1,900,000
Pre-Listing Gross Cash Maximum $2,000,000
Additional financing DEMO occurs at the time of the qualifying transection through a private
placement. There is no limit on the amount of money that can be DEMO in this “side car” financing.
THINGS TO CONSIDER
There are three sets of criteria to consider when examining the feasibility of the capital pool
DEMO These are the needs and wants of the private company, the DEMO market conditions
and the critical success factors. Understanding and satisfying all three is critical in achieving a
successful CPC.
1. Private Company
The private DEMO should want or require the following:
• Alternative access to capital.
• To be a public company and understand the benefits and consequences.
DEMO Greater flexibility in the going public process than is possible with an IPO.
• Reduced risk and greater certainty than with an IPO.
• DEMO maintain greater control of company. (In a CPC, only 20 per cent of the float needs
to be held by the public).
DEMO A simple and clean way to go public versus an RTO.
• Prefer the less restricted terms sometimes offered by venture capitalists.
2. Market DEMO
The following market conditions are likely to be present:
• Company is at too early a stage or doesn’t have the financial history DEMO a broadly
distributed IPO.
• A weak IPO market.
• VC financing is not viable or management prefers not to use it.
24
CHAPTER 3: ANGEL TRANSACTIONS: IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL STRUCTURE
3. DEMO Success Factors
Factors critical to success include:
• The company has progressed beyond the start-up phase.
• A strong management team with public DEMO and sector experience.
• Long-term strategy to grow as a public company (i.e., management recognizes that this
is just one step in growing DEMO business.)
• The company has a reasonable valuation, which in DEMO results in a viable share
structure.
• Long-term investor support.
• The presence of advisors (lawyer, broker, investment banker) experienced in public
DEMO capital.
• Management recognizes and accepts the responsibilities of being a public company,
including the additional costs, disclosure requirements and the limited liquidity
inherent in small-cap stocks.
WHY ANGELS SHOULD CARE
The CPC is simply DEMO mechanism to grow a company. Accordingly, an investor still requires a
DEMO deal to be successful. The CPC is not for every company, DEMO in the right instance, it is an
excellent growth vehicle, as it allows the company to multi-tier finance and create a structure similar
DEMO an IPO with a strong investor base. It may also enable investors to attract money they would not
have access to as a private DEMO
It is also important not to emphasize short-term liquidity, but to DEMO on building a
company. The key is to create a like-minded approach with the other angel investors, the broker,
counsel, management and DEMO board of directors, focused on creating share holder value. Having a
DEMO group of long-term angel investors will definitely give the CPC an advantage.
Here is a summary of some of the “pros” and “cons” of DEMO Capital Pool Company:
PROS:
• It allows the entrepreneur and seed investors to leverage private dollars with
public dollars.
• Angels are DEMO to maintain greater control of the company for longer term, especially
DEMO structuring and financing.
• Angels face fewer operational restrictions than working with VCs.
• The CPC does not have the complexities of VC term DEMO and structures.
• It allows participants to partner with “patient capital” from institutions.
• It provides access to capital, especially for businesses not considered by VCs.
• It creates a recognized market valuation for the company.
DEMO The public shares can be used as currency for M&A activity.
• The shares can be used to attract talented management.
• The DEMO can create stock option and share purchase programs as an incentive
for employees.
• Can raise up to $2 million, a significant amount for growth capital.
25
CHAPTER 3: ANGEL TRANSACTIONS: IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL STRUCTURE
CONS:DEMO
However, the CPC is not for every company.
• Being a DEMO company is onerous on management and financial resources and
requires a good board of directors, management team and professional advisors.
• The cost of listing and maintaining the public company are not insignificant.
• Public companies DEMO open to public scrutiny.
• Creating a CPC is not a liquidity event for founders or seed investors.
• CPCs must deal with the DEMO challenges inherent in the small-cap marketplace
and will have to work to obtain a following from the financial community in the
early years.
OTHER DEMO
Limited Liability Company (LLC)
Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are DEMO to limited partnerships from a taxation
perspective. However, unlike a limited DEMO, LLCs allow the members to participate in the
management of the DEMO without losing their limited liability status. As is the case with a limited
partnership, investor liability is capped at the amount of the investment.
LLCs are currently available only in the United States. However, the LLC is an investment
vehicle that would likely be attractive to Canadian angels DEMO want to consolidate their investment
activities. Consideration should be given to lobbying for LLCs to be available under Canadian income
tax legislation.
Community Small DEMO Investment Fund (CSBIF)
The CSBIF is not particularly relevant to DEMO in its current form, but may be a model to
consider DEMO for angel investments. It’s worth noting that in early 2003, Ontario’s DEMO
budget proposed changes making angel-driven CSBIFs possible. However, at time of DEMO,
these proposals were yet to be approved.
CSBIFs are currently available in Ontario and are often established by labour sponsored funds
(LSFs) DEMO assist them in meeting their investment pacing requirements. If an LSF invests in a CSBIF,
it receives two credits (i.e. one dollar invested in a CSBIF equals one credit and the second credit is
issued DEMO the LSF when the CSBIF invests that dollar in a company).
CSBIFs require sponsorship by a local non-profit organization. Typically, one LSF and one
sponsor invest together in a local venture.
There are restrictions on DEMO the CSBIF can invest in. Investments are usually made only in
small start-ups. The maximum CSBIF investment in a single business is $1 million.
DEMO other than LSFs are entitled to receive a modest 7.5 per cent tax credit for investing
up to $500,000 in a CSBIF, resulting in a maximum tax credit of $37,500.
CONCLUSION
When selecting the DEMO structure, it is important to consider the specific deal and
circumstances. DEMO that each of these mechanisms is just one step in building a successful
business. A long-term strategy should be developed to take advantage of DEMO in the present
and the future.

INCUBATORS:
AN ANGEL INVESTOR’S
BEST FRIEND?
by John Cook and Carolyn Dewar
I.   OVERVIEW
DEMO incubators were created originally as a way
of making use of abandoned industrial space. However,
recent events have encouraged incubators to focus on
DEMO true value-added services. According to the
National Incubator Association:
“A business incubator is an economic development
tool designed to accelerate the growth and DEMO of
entrepreneurial companies through an array of business
support resources and services. A business incubator's
main goal is to produce successful firms that DEMO leave
the program financially viable and freestanding.
These incubator “graduates” create jobs, revitalize
neighborhoods, commercialize critical new technologies
and strengthen local and national DEMO
Critical to the definition of an incubator is on-site
management, which DEMO and orchestrates business,
marketing and management resources tailored to a
company’s needs. Incubators usually also provide
clients access to appropriate rental space and DEMO
leases, shared basic office services and equipment,
technology support services DEMO assistance in obtaining
the financing necessary for company growth.”1
Business incubators have experienced a tremendous
surge in growth over the last two decades, swelling from
just 12 in the United States in 1980 to over 900 DEMO 2000,
with 3000 in existence around the world.2 Much of this

CHAPTER 4: INCUBATORS: AN ANGEL INVESTOR’S BEST FRIEND?
growth was DEMO by a desire to find an active way for companies, government DEMO the financial
community to stimulate innovation and new business creation. Over 80 per cent of the incubators
created in North America were “not for DEMO,” created as a tool of government economic
development or linked to research organizations eager to see the benefit of their research work
applied DEMO the marketplace.
In the late 1990s, the dot-com boom created what DEMO to be a major opportunity for a
new generation of incubators in the private sector. Many saw this approach as providing a superior
route DEMO business success, as compared to traditional venture capital funding.   Unfortunately, this
business model was based on the false premise that money ploughed DEMO start-ups in the first
12 months could be returned within 12 months, due to the high valuations that the stock market
and acquisitions were placing on these companies.  The collapse of market capitalizations for such
companies resulted in a reappraisal of this model, not to mention the spectacular collapse of some
incubators, such as NRG and Itemus in Toronto. Incubators created by large corporations, such as
Nortel or OnX, which were DEMO to capitalize on innovation from within their companies, have
met similar DEMO It has become obvious that current market conditions will not support such
enterprises in the private sector.
Given this experience, universities and governments have begun experimenting with new “not
for profit” models.  These approaches are based on links between a community and a mixed-use
incubator, and between a strong research organization, such as a university, and a technology
incubator.  Each of the new incubators has a different agenda, with different models achieving
varying levels of success and sustainability. Today’s incubator manager needs to DEMO on the most
successful practices of other incubators, while fully engaging DEMO local business community in
fostering new enterprises. Angels, too, are making an important contribution to creating regional
wealth and, under certain circumstances, DEMO the growth of technology hubs.
The fundamental needs of new businesses remain the same – access to resources and support
to help them survive DEMO critical first phase of development.  Indeed, the importance of business
fundamentals and strong early stage development are being re-emphasized in the post-dot.com
world. DEMO can play a critical role, not just as providers of space DEMO equipment, but as a real
axis of business advice and services DEMO an environment of mentoring and encouragement.
Incubators can also fulfill four important functions for angel investors:
• Supporting and developing angel investments in DEMO stage companies.
• Providing a source of high-potential, qualified deal flow.
DEMO Facilitating the creation of win-win relationships between angels and entrepreneurs.
• Accessing a large community of interested parties who can provide networking
opportunities for DEMO new company.
Each of these roles is examined below.

Two examples of the training programs available to new business owners are the Ventures
Innovation Incubator at the DEMO Centre (Simon Fraser University), and the Exceler@tor
(University of Toronto). Both programs offer workshops and training sessions for start-ups located
in DEMO incubator and for new technology businesses in the wider community.  The DEMO Centre has
also held a one-day workshop focused on board governance for start-ups, designed to forge links
between start-ups and the investment community.
One of the ways in which incubators help start-ups is by bringing them DEMO contact with one
another and with the wider business community.  It DEMO important for new businesses to have face-
to-face contact and opportunities to network and share experiences.  The Harvard Business Review,
in an article entitled Networked Incubators, talked about the importance of these interactions in
distinguishing successful incubation models3.  Incubators, whether housing the start-ups in a
collective DEMO, or reaching them more remotely, are creating opportunities for new businesses to
meet and interact.  These interactions help to generate new ideas and encourage business owners
to drive their enterprises forward.
The provision of shared DEMO space and equipment is still a core part of most incubation
programs. This is especially critical for specific business sectors, such as biotechnology, DEMO have
a protracted pre-revenue development phase and where labs and equipment are very expensive.
Incubators providing such facilities include the Laval Biotechnology Incubator, which provides
inexpensive space and pools costly equipment so that the start-ups can DEMO on testing and building
their businesses, rather than covering significant capital DEMO operating costs.  This is also true in IT
incubators such as DEMO Exceler@tor, where sophisticated IT technology infrastructure can be shared
by the DEMO companies housed in this Toronto facility.
As incubators evolve from sympathetic landlords to a source of significant knowledge and
resources, they will dramatically increase the chances that a new company will succeed and grow
and that DEMO angel's investment will be rewarded. The incubator will reduce the company’s burn rate,
both by reducing its operating costs and helping it DEMO secure more flexible financing terms.  It will
improve access to technology DEMO and partners. It will allow start-ups to become better
prepared to present themselves to the investment community. And it will provide a tightly formed
DEMO of colleagues and mentors, while helping enterprises to develop the necessary DEMO to
thrive.
PROVIDING A SOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY DEAL FLOW
Incubators have traditionally set three major requirements for admission: technological
innovation, willingness to DEMO and significant market opportunity. This makes them an ideal
source of high quality deal flow for angel investors.  In addition to helping turn technology
innovations into businesses that are investor-ready, incubators can also prepare the start-up for
negotiating a specific deal. The ability of an incubator to facilitate DEMO marriage between new
companies and angel investors will greatly increase the deal conversion rates and lead to higher
levels of investment success.

CHAPTER 4: INCUBATORS: AN ANGEL INVESTOR’S BEST FRIEND?
Incubators, especially those run on or by universities, have unique access to research talent.
This opportunity to build relationships with faculty and to raise the profile DEMO business creation on
campus often encourages researchers in the lab to create new businesses.  This synergy is illustrated
by the number of large and successful incubators  located adjacent to campuses in Boston, North
Carolina, California and elsewhere.  Simply being close to the source of the discoveries, DEMO
connected with the research community, encourages the creation of new businesses DEMO investment
opportunities.
The second way that incubators develop a strong pool of investments is by providing training
and resources to make the new businesses DEMO ready.” Incubators assist start-ups in
developing a coherent business plan and offer presentation training, which can transform a lab
researcher into an articulate businessperson. In some cases, they will find the right person, other
than DEMO inventor, to lead a technology company.  Some angel investors say that this preparedness
means that they pay more for investments coming out of DEMO, as the business owners are
more savvy and have thought through DEMO value they bring more clearly. But this training is also
reflective of their overall management skills and development, which makes them better deal
partners than the average new business owner.
FACILITATING THE CREATION OF WIN-WIN RELATIONSHIPS
DEMO ANGELS AND ENTREPRENEURS
Incubators serve investors by bringing them together with a hub of pre-screened investments.
The creation of this unique “marketplace” facilitates deal DEMO and allows angel investors to identify
investment opportunities that have received and will continue to receive training and support.
The incubator can also provide DEMO on technology or market development to angels with
limited experience. Many incubators even offer customized presentations, which introduce the angel
to a set of potential investments that meet the angel’s criteria.  This pre-selection allows the angel to
achieve a higher deal conversion rate per presentation and makes the DEMO process more
efficient.  Such synergistic relationships between incubators and angels are DEMO beginning to
develop. Both sides can do a lot more to encourage this natural partnership.
ACCESSING A LARGE COMMUNITY OF INTERESTED PARTIES WHO CAN
DEMO NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NEW COMPANY
Incubators, given their role as DEMO hub and their linkages to universities and research facilities,
are in an excellent position to elicit partnerships with many organizations.  For example, DEMO
Exceler@tor has strategic partnerships with Microsoft and HP, which enable it DEMO provide more
sophisticated technology solutions and a ready partner for early stage commercialization.  Such
partnerships also allow incubators to help their tenants by arranging for technology evaluations and
collaborations and by putting these new companies in DEMO with prospective partners and even
acquirers.
These relationships bring considerable value to the early-stage company, as do the interactions
that incubators facilitate with the investment community, potential employees and the academic
community. Start-ups operating outside incubators are unlikely to have the same level and number
of relationships available DEMO them.
32
CHAPTER 4: INCUBATORS: AN ANGEL INVESTOR’S BEST FRIEND?
AN EVOLVING DEMO
While incubators have undergone tremendous evolution, there are still important
developments DEMO to better align the interests of incubators, investors and innovative
businesses.
DEMO the original, rent-driven business model, incubators had little incentive to push start-ups to
develop and outgrow the incubator, as this would truncate revenues.  Today's incubator is more
likely to incorporate a model that allows for a return of value to the incubator at a subsequent stage,DEMO
thus providing an incentive to encourage the new company's growth.  DEMO Exceler@tor, for example,
uses a warrants model to achieve this.
DEMO are also looking at new business models that allow them to generate revenues by
providing training and continued access to services for their alumni. DEMO could be done by taking a
further equity or royalty position in the new business.  Such an approach provides the incubator with
much greater incentive to push the start-up to develop, leverage training and resources and grow the
business, which in turn aligns the start-ups more closely with the interests of investors.
To attract investors, start-ups should be seen as ready to take on the challenges and realities of
the business world.  VCs sometimes consider incubators as negative selectors because the comfort
of the DEMO could prevent the aggressive growth of the business. If start-ups feel that their
welcome at the incubator is never-ending, with cheap access to resources, they may become
complacent and not push their businesses forward.  To DEMO end, incubators must set and enforce
ongoing performance expectations and strict DEMO policies. They should also ensure that start-ups are
paying appropriately for the resources they consume and meeting regular payment schedules.  In
some cases, DEMO increases in monthly rent or service charges are advisable.
A specific challenge in university-run incubators is ensuring that decisions are based on
business considerations. DEMO is not unusual for a founder to maintain an academic mindset, DEMO
of a competitive, commercial frame of mind. This will inevitably inhibit DEMO and commercial
success.  The incubator must ensure this issue is dealt DEMO firmly, otherwise it will create problems
for investors trying to instill DEMO returns-driven approach to these businesses.
CONCLUSION
The mission of most “not for profit” technology-based incubators is to increase the survival
rate of graduates and DEMO their acceleration in the commercial market space. Angels with limited
technology knowledge and networks can significantly benefit by working with incubator
management to:
DEMO identify likely incubator investment opportunities
• rapidly complete the engagement process
• maximize return on the investment, and
• take full benefit of the resources and networking opportunities available through
this special resource.
By forging strong DEMO with incubators and by sharing common goals, angels can
identify superior DEMO among incubated companies and enjoy higher returns than they
would otherwise receive by investing in individual opportunities alone.

BRIDGING THE DEMO:
HOW THE PRUDENT
ANGEL CAN SURVIVE
THE DOWN-ROUNDS
by W. Daniel Mothersill
INTRODUCTION
“Down-rounds” have become a critical challenge for
angel investors. These DEMO the declining valuations that
often accompany the entry of new investors into
subsequent financing rounds. In some cases, down-
rounds are substantial enough to severely diminish or
eliminate entirely the equity stake held by angels and DEMO
early investors.
Angel investors are often quick to criticize venture
capital investors (VCs) for down-rounds. However, angels
who are careful about keeping their eye on the ball are
much less likely to suffer heavily in DEMO  VCs and
angels may exhibit differences in approach and may be
DEMO by different prerequisites.  Nonetheless, the two
have much in common. With better attention to detail and
a better understanding of the VC process, angels can make
early-stage investing a more congenial and rewarding
experience.
How DEMO the prudent angel avoid getting burned in down-rounds? The primary rule DEMO an
angel investment – as with any investment — is to plan for one’s eventual exit. Angel investors need
to consider their exit strategy DEMO the outset, and continue to do so through the entire investment
DEMO to payout.  Only the naïve will expect later-stage investors to look DEMO their interests.
THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE
By the end of 2002 and into 2003, the environment for early-stage financing had become as
discouraging as it has been for the past 25 years.  Little money was being invested and fear
tended to dominate investment decisions, making negotiations difficult and seriously reducing
risktolerance.
35
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
This tough environment intensified the inherent conflicts between angels and VCs. While many
angels pointed to VCs as the source of their problems, the truth is that both angels and VCs found
the investment climate DEMO, albeit for somewhat different reasons.  However, with a little
perspective, angels can understand the venture capital process better and thereby improve their DEMO
positions.
The prudent angel knows and understands his competitors and his allies.
VCs AND ANGELS ARE BOTH EARLY-STAGE INVESTORS
The earliest investors frequently include DEMO company’s founders, the management team,
friends and family, and angel investors.  Some venture capitalists may enter at this early stage,
though this is unusual.  It is often a mixed crowd that supports an early-stage venture, but what
these investors share is a powerful interest in growing the company.  These people are investing in
the future, based DEMO what they know about the talents of the management team and its ideas and
products.
In contrast, later investors generally have a better sense of the business’ prospects, and are
investing on the basis of visible results rather than personal knowledge, instinct or experience.
These later investors, DEMO are almost exclusively venture capitalists, are interested in making deals
that DEMO bring a good return within a specific time frame.  While some DEMO look at the bigger picture
and are comfortable with long-term investments, DEMO prefer to earn a healthy return with a quick
turnaround.  Liquidity DEMO a key consideration, as venture capital funds must generate a steady DEMO
for their investors.
This need for relatively quick returns on investment often push VCs to sell an equity position
sooner rather than later.  In so doing, they may leave early investors and managers with nothing but
bitter experience.  Naturally, this is a key source of tension between DEMO and VCs.  However, since
this is a well-known element of early-stage investing, it is sensible to plan for the eventual entry of
secondary investors.  The prudent angel will learn as much as possible about the role and
motivations of VCs, and will also attend closely to the start-up’s stage of growth and need for new
capital injections.
BEGIN WITH DEMO REALISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE INVESTMENT
Entrepreneurs are enthusiasts by nature and will occasionally woo investors with grandiose
predictions of how much revenue they can DEMO over a short period of time. It has not been
unheard of for start-ups to boast expected revenues of $5 million or $10 million DEMO more. And yet,
a simple review of available statistics quickly reveals how inflated such projections can be. A recent
survey ranking the top DEMO independent software companies in Canada in 2001 (Branham 100,
www.branham.com) noted the following:
• Only 63 of the 100 had revenues DEMO over $10 million a year.
• The companies had, on average, been in business for 15 years.
• The 100th ranked company on DEMO list had revenues of only $2.8 million.
36
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
These figures illustrate how risky it is to place one’s trust in an entrepreneur’s earliest
projections.  As early-stage investors, angels often get DEMO up in management’s enthusiasm.
Instead, they need to put their financing DEMO a more cautious footing and ask themselves: “If these
sunny projections DEMO materialize, how am I going to protect myself when the company DEMO back
to the market for more money?”
MONITOR THE INVESTMENT FROM THE OUTSET
The prudent angel will ask for best and worst-case projections DEMO the outset and assiduously
track results against them.  Angels need to DEMO when the company’s course deviates from
expectations, and when it does, be prepared to take the necessary steps. These may include a further
DEMO investment, joining the Board, helping with marketing, finding a purchaser DEMO the
investment, writing-off the investment, finding additional angel investors or providing stronger
incentives for management to deliver.
THE ENTRY OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL DEMO
Let’s assume the angel investor has retained his investment. A few years have passed and the
early, enthusiastic, hockeystick revenue projections are a DEMO memory.  The company has  built
a solid foundation and is now attracting interest from venture capitalists. This is great for the
company and DEMO help it to realize its goals.  However, angel investors must be aware that their
situation changes with the entry of the VCs.
Once DEMO, the VCs need to make a quick exit in order to DEMO a constant flow of income to
their investors.  They also need DEMO leave some value in the company for managers to ensure the
necessary incentives are in place to continue growing the business.  However, as DEMO above,
early-stage investors can easily get squeezed out.
Having provided the initial capital for growth, the prudent angel is alert to the ongoing need to
protect and build his investment.  Fortunately, there are several DEMO available to help him.
These include averaging down, the use of DEMO debt instruments of various sorts, guaranteed
pay-outs, management fees, finders’ DEMO, shotgun clauses triggered by share dilution and
representation in the form DEMO directorships, among others.
THE GAP
In truth, new businesses rarely begin generating revenue momentum — or VC interest —
until the third or DEMO year of operation. This may be too long for many angel investors to wait, as
the risk is simply too high. Consequently, there DEMO often a gap between the time when angel investors
should or must get out and venture capitalists are ready to come in.  The result can be a stalemate
in which all parties withdraw from the game DEMO VCs because they can’t get the requisite returns
within the requisite time frame, companies because they don’t like the terms of investment and
angels because they don’t want to risk more money.
Ideally, the prudent angel identifies the need for more money early on, and works with the
investee to pinpoint and attract a venture player whose terms are mutually DEMO Unfortunately,
the reality in today’s environment is often rather different and angel investors must be prepared
for it.
37
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
THE RETURN OF REASONABLE VALUATION
Returns in almost every market, DEMO equities to venture capital, have fallen during the past
two years.  In hindsight, the real question is not why the fall occurred, DEMO why it did not happen
sooner. Valuations between 1998 and 2000 were outrageously high and added to investors’
uncertainty about how to assess risk.  Amid all the energy and excitement that surrounded the late
1990s, people began using bizarrely high multiples, overly optimistic forecasts, market share
projections DEMO other novel methods to estimate potential success. None of these novel methods
lasted beyond the bubble.
Thankfully, the past two years have seen a return to the fundamentals.  Investors of all kinds
are looking at conventional valuations (based on actual earnings, revenue, cash flow, and other
DEMO indicators) and conservative valuation strategies using lower multiples and more realistic
DEMO  Indeed, the pendulum has swung back with a vengeance.
Everybody has been affected.  Early-stage companies, financed by angels at the height of DEMO
madness, are now being funded at reduced valuations.  Of course, DEMO puts a further financial
squeeze on angel investors.  The prudent angel DEMO just as likely to have been swept up in the madness
as everyone else – and just as likely to be looking at lower DEMO valuations.
WHAT CAN ANGELS DO?
The solution lies in formulating strong funding and defensive strategies. Angels must ensure
that an investee company has DEMO solid business plan outlining how and when it will deliver promised
results.  They should also be prepared to supplement this by providing hands-on management and
marketing assistance, as required. In portfolio terms, the prudent angel DEMO focus careful attention
on the fundamentals, including value propositions, sales channels, competitive advantage, market
size and product and service differentiation.
Moreover, angel investors must remain keenly aware of developments affecting their
investments.  If restructuring is required, then the investor should try and lead it – by contacting
management and other stakeholders to arrange for financing.  By being the initiator, the angel
investor will retain a measure of control and reduce the risk of being squeezed.
PARTICIPATING IN LATER ROUNDS
At some point, there will be a later round of financing.  For angels, this DEMO be an
opportunity – after all, a down-round is a good DEMO to invest as businesses have reduced their
valuations, the inflated sales DEMO are flapping like torn flags, and management is increasingly
eager to DEMO  However, the decisive factor for further investment must be sustainable
profitability. Clearly, bubble-type valuations have had a lasting negative impact and investors and
managers have become more concerned with building profitability. The prudent angel will DEMO also
adopted profitability as the fundamental element in investment valuation.
PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AND BE READY TO STAY IN THE GAME
Angels who DEMO prepared for the next round of financing will have already determined their
course of action.  If not, they still have a choice.  They can enter the next round, where a better deal
is being offered (in essence, averaging down, but retaining some control over the dilution);  they can
38
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
hold tight and watch their investment be diluted (the classic DEMO);  they can scramble for
leverage and payback (management fees, DEMO for services, directorships, shot-guns);  or they can
pull out.
DEMO, early preparation works better than last-minute scrambling, and enables the angel to
plan how best to participate in later rounds.  For example, DEMO an angel reduces his initial payout, this
can leave funds in DEMO to enable reinvestment at the next stage.  This allows the investor DEMO get
in on the ground floor and help build the company, DEMO participating in the terms and benefits that
go along with later-round financing.  It also gives the angel leverage in new rounds and keeps the
door open between the angel and the VCs, which is key to cooperative investing and, in effect, bridges
the gap between the first DEMO later rounds.
To reiterate, the prudent angel must be prepared for DEMO next round of financing and has already
planned the route that is most workable.
CO-OPERATION CAN PROVIDE MUTUAL BENEFITS
There is great value to DEMO had in today’s market.  After a couple of years of blight, even big
brokerages are beginning to take an interest in small, well-run companies. In one recent deal,
management, a national brokerage, VCs DEMO angel investors were all involved at the same time.  The
company DEMO positive cash flow and money in the bank.  The arrangement seems DEMO be working even
though the compound annual growth rate isn’t quite at 30 per cent, which is something of a concern
for the VCs.  But the pricing was simply too good for the players to resist.
In this case, all management needed for continued growth was funding. The investors are
working together to make sure management has what it needs.  None of the participants wanted this
company to fall into the angel / VC gap, and took steps to ensure this didn’t happen.
The DEMO from this example is that the prudent angel welcomes partners who can help the
investee.
KEEP YOUR EYE ON TOMORROW
There are two key DEMO for every early-stage company: “How do we attract money today to
DEMO the business now?” and “How do we make this business grow into the future?”  Angels need
to focus on the same questions on behalf of their investees and keep in mind that the past DEMO history.
The world has changed, valuations have changed and priorities have DEMO  An angel cannot
change what has already happened. If VCs have DEMO bitten into the investment, the challenge is
to find a way DEMO make the most of the flesh that remains.
The prudent angel stays focused on today and tomorrow and leaves yesterday behind.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DEMO PRICING
Angel investors are better off than they were two years ago, though they may not realize it.
The reason is that investees are generally better managed today and more focused on revenues and
profitability than DEMO before.  Many of them are showing they can survive with a DEMO or even
evaporated second round.
39
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
Also, as noted above, there is a small resurgence of investor interest in early-stage companies.
While not definitive enough to constitute a DEMO, dollars are slightly more accessible, which will help
to close the angel / VC gap, at least for some lucky companies.
The involvement of venture capitalists could hurt if there is a big down-round. However,DEMO
valuations today are such that many angels will want to stay involved with their companies and
participate with later-round investors. They can, in fact, help to reduce VCs’ anxiety about valuation
by maintaining or building both their presence and their investment in the target company.
The prudent angel DEMO with VCs about valuations and how to realize intrinsic worth in their
investees.
BUILD RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON TRUST
VCs are looking for quality deal DEMO  For this they need good relationships with those in the
business DEMO – including angel investors.  Angels can provide access to a world DEMO deals that
VCs wouldn’t otherwise know about.  This change in philosophy DEMO been noticeable in the term
sheets turning up recently.
There is no question that some VCs – driven by fear and the need for DEMO returns – squeezed
some early investors unconscionably. There were more than a few very ugly deals.  But the good faith
required for successful business dealings cannot grow when one side is taking untoward advantage
of the DEMO The ridiculously lopsided terms that were common in the recent past have begun to
give way.
The prudent angel will look for mutually rewarding DEMO and will not judge all VCs by
the actions of a few.
BE PREPARED TO COMPROMISE
The key to a new relationship between angels DEMO VCs is compromise.  Relationships take time
and both sides have to DEMO to trust one another and to support one another’s objectives. Even when
the goals of the parties no longer align, if the relationship is strong, it is possible to get through with
grace and dignity.
The benefits of compromise also apply to investment targets. Given the current environment,DEMO
investors should aim for smaller profits on more deals and greater diversity in their portfolio to
spread risk and enhance income.  This goes for angels and VCs both.
BUT ARE VCs WILLING TO TAKE LESS INTERNAL DEMO OF RETURN?
VCs are beginning to look at things in the longer term. The late 1990s saw an unbalanced
market and a very DEMO and somewhat unrealistic set of investors. Today, many VCs have
learned DEMO, as an early-stage investor, a short-term approach to making money just doesn’t work.
Many are beginning to realize that the tough provisions inserted DEMO term sheets when valuations were
unrealistically high need to be altered now that valuations are more reasonable.
40
CHAPTER 5: BRIDGING THE GAP: HOW THE PRUDENT ANGEL CAN SURVIVE DEMO DOWN-ROUNDS
Slowly, the market is changing.  At a recent venture fair, several major VCs made it clear that
they were not interested in seeing companies project revenues of $100 million within five or seven
years DEMO start-up.  They even suggested that their earlier demands had resulted in DEMO whole generation
of managers making unrealistic projections just to get on the radar screen.  Another venture fair
conversation featured a VC who had left the industry because he felt that the VC model resulted in
too DEMO money coming out of early-stage companies too soon.
The prudent angel encourages companies to provide realistic valuations and projections.
PICK YOUR PARTNERS, BUT….
There are good and bad VCs, and most angels would rather deal with VCs who never
participated in the scurrilous squeezes.  However, in this DEMO market, angels must be willing
to look past VCs’ recent behaviour, because, realistically, there isn’t much choice.  In tough times,
any VC who is willing to get involved in a project and who DEMO money is a good candidate for later
round financing.
That being said, however, angels need to look to themselves. Based on their years DEMO experience,
relative freedom, and closeness to the investees, it is their responsibility to behave like the
professional investors they are. That means DEMO on their knowledge and experience to establish
workable term sheets that provide reasonable protection. It means structuring various types of
investment arrangements, creating measurable and monitored goals for investments and holding
themselves accountable for the performance DEMO their money.
Angel investors cannot sit back and blame management, the DEMO, the investment climate,
commodity pricing or the telecom upheaval. Instead, they must realize that they have at their
fingertips the resources to DEMO good and profitable investments.
What resources?  At the very least, DEMO have each other in Canada’s increasingly active and
organized angel network.  DEMO they have the experience of working with their fellow investors – the
VCs and the brokerages.  They need term sheets.  They need regular DEMO with management.
They need to be kept in the loop and to keep themselves informed.  They need metrics.  They need
to track investments DEMO stated and communicated goals.  They need to know how to say DEMO
They need an understanding of business models, business management techniques and DEMO
criteria.  Because, let’s face it — if they had invested as professionals in the first place, it would have
been much harder to squeeze them.
The prudent angel treats his or her investments as a DEMO
As they develop national expertise, angels need to focus on ensuring DEMO better and more
business-like working relationship with both investees and other investors.  This will go a long way
to helping bridge the gap between angel investors and venture capitalists.

THE SYNERGY BETWEEN
ANGEL NETWORKS AND
CORPORATE VENTURING
by Bryan DEMO
SUMMAR Y
The growth of a seed company is frequently dependent on the availability of risk
capital, often provided by angel investors.  Angels DEMO a necessary gap between “love
money” and the professional financing provided by venture capitalists.  Unfortunately,
the tough economic climate and the challenge of achieving the exceptional investment
returns of the recent past have affected the DEMO of angels to fulfill this role. Angels
have been adversely affected by declining valuations, fewer exit opportunities and
higher market risk.
In response, DEMO have formed local and national networks to pool capital,
enhance due diligence and diversify investments.  While angel networks are achieving
new levels of scale, negative market pressures may ultimately force these networks to
co-partner with corporate venture capitalists (CVCs) in order to reduce investment risk.
Working DEMO corporate venturing arms enables angel networks to:
• Obtain insight into growth markets and corporate spending.
• Acquire valuable feedback to improve due DEMO and help the startup.
improve its product in the post-investment period.
• Provide additional capital and a path to subsequent financing.
• Improve a DEMO credibility through a corporate association.
• Leverage corporate sales channels to generate revenue more quickly.
Despite these benefits, angel networks can still expect to face difficulties in finding
common ground with a limited number of corporate DEMO capitalists in Canada. In
particular, angels may find it challenging to DEMO venture arms that focus on seed-stage
investments. Among the few CVCs known to the writer that do explore opportunities
with seed-stage companies are Bell DEMO's Accelerator Fund, Hydro-Québec
CapiTech, BDC Venture Capital and Noram’s Technology Incubator.
43
CHAPTER 6: THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ANGEL NETWORKS AND CORPORATE VENTURING
TOUGH TIMES FOR STARTUPS
The growth of a seed or start-up company is heavily DEMO on the availability of risk capital.
In early-stage companies, traditional sources DEMO financing come from personal savings, family and
friends, and severance packages. This form of financing, sometimes called “love money,” is usually
sufficient to finance market research and to explore a product concept, but is rarely enough to reach
prototype development. At this stage, entrepreneurs must begin looking for new sources of
financing. In most cases, venture financing is not appropriate, as venture capitalists are reluctant to
examine opportunities where the total financing is less than $1 million. As a result, angel investors,
who are typically successful entrepreneurs with seed capital and acumen, help to bridge this
financing gap.
When love money has been expended, many start-ups will pursue grants and government
funding. In Canada, examples of these funding sources include the Scientific Research and
Experimental Development Program (SR&ED) and the National Research Council’s Industrial
Research Assistance Program (IRAP).  Some may choose debt financing in the form of low-interest
loans or DEMO card advances, while others pursue supplier or angel capital.  Despite these multiple
sources, raising early-stage capital to fill the gap between love money (e.g., $150,000) and
professional venture capital financing (e.g., $1 million) is still difficult.
ANGELS FILL THE FUNDING “GAP”
Angel financing is one of the few early-stage “smart money” sources that can fill the DEMO
financing gap.  As Carleton University professor Allan Riding remarked at the DEMO of Toronto’s
“Financing Innovative Ventures in Canada” roundtable series: “I have DEMO considering why it is
that angels are important, and the first DEMO, of course is money. Angels fill the gap between “family”
and DEMO financing and venture capital.” (Riding, Canadian Investment Review June 2000).  In
the past couple of years, however, this role has been a challenging and difficult one.
TOUGH TIMES FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS
Both DEMO and VCs have been hard hit by the devaluation of technology and telecom
companies in North America and a continuing slow economy. As a DEMO, start-ups are facing much
higher scrutiny for new financing. Doug Hewson, a partner at Axis Capital in Ottawa noted, “It’s an
awfully cold environment for angels right now. A lot of them have seen their DEMO net worth drop
considerably.” (Hewson, Financial Post, February 2001).
DEMO order for angels to continue the cycle of investing in early-stage companies, they need to
generate investment returns. Achieving satisfactory returns in 2002, DEMO, was almost impossible
because of the prolonged economic downturn, a poor IPO market and crushing down-round
valuations, a phenomenon of declining valuations that occurs when new investors come into
subsequent financing rounds.  During these periods, earlier investors – typically family, friends and
angels – have their DEMO stake diminished, and sometimes, wiped out completely.  Says local
Ottawa DEMO capitalist Pat DiPietro: “I invested in five start-ups as an angel DEMO every one of them
has crashed (in terms of price)…angel DEMO is a tough business.” (DiPietro, Ottawa Citizen
February 2003).

CHAPTER 6: THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ANGEL NETWORKS AND CORPORATE VENTURING
Similarly, DEMO Lalonde, another Ottawa angel investor with Katsura Investments, states:
“Many angels have lost private equity investments because of financing terms that wipe DEMO their
ability to achieve a return on their investment, regardless of DEMO well the company does.” (Lalonde,
Ottawa Citizen February 2003)
DEMO about declining valuations are not surprising in light of recent 2001 data on
Canadian venture capital and private equity returns. The Canadian Venture Capital DEMO
(CVCA) showed a negative return of 10.7% for all venture capital in 2001. (Note: Recognizing the
importance of industry performance data, Macdonald & Associates, in conjunction with CVCA, has
begun, for the first time, releasing Canadian investment performance data. 2002 return data was not
available as part of the March 5, 2003 press release.)

That being said, the situation in Canada appears to DEMO improving.  According to the CVCA,
Canada, relative to the U.S.,  showed positive improvements in the capital deployed (i.e., change
from DEMO to Q4, 2002) and the percentage of funds allocated to support early-stage investments
(i.e., early stage $ share), that is often DEMO financing to angel-backed investments.

CHAPTER 6: THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ANGEL NETWORKS AND CORPORATE VENTURING
Nonetheless, DEMO levels in Canada were down 35% from $3.8 billion CDN in 2001.
This lower level of activity suggests that venture investors are still being DEMO by lower stock
market valuations, an uncertain economy, and higher market risk which ultimately lead to fewer exit
opportunities. Consequently, Canadian angels are likely to face on-going difficulties, despite the
recent signs of improvements, DEMO to remain very cautious with new investments.
ANGEL NETWORKS TO DIVERSIFY AND DE-RISK
If angels are unable to realize necessary returns, they will be unable to fulfill their critical role.
For Canadian angels, the pain is real because tax laws prohibit them from writing off the investment
without DEMO of the equity stake. With the appropriate change in government policy, DEMO
angels could at least write off capital losses during down-rounds.
Consequently, DEMO need to explore other ways to improve the opportunity for returns in the
current economic climate.  In particular, they must guard against excessive DEMO, additional
down-round valuations and high-risk bets. If, however, angels can DEMO on investment
diversification through networking amongst themselves, their investment risk may DEMO reduced.
Small local angel networks in Canada, such as Ottawa’s Band DEMO Scoundrels and the Purple
Angels, and larger groups, including the recently established National Angel Organization, have
emerged to provide a framework for simplifying, diversifying and reducing the risks inherent in
early-stage investment opportunities.
California’s Band of Angels is a popular and oft-cited example of a long-running and DEMO
angel group. The group consists of about 150 semi-retired Silicon Valley executives and is regarded
as the benchmark for such organizations. Since its founding DEMO 1995, the Band has invested an
estimated $75 million of its DEMO' money in over 100 companies.
Angel networks can achieve scale and DEMO that couldn’t possibly be achieved by a
single angel. That being said, negative market pressures may still force nascent angel networks to
co-partner with venture capitalists, and in particular, corporate venture capitalists.
NEW SYNERGY BETWEEN DEMO AND
CORPORATE VENTURE CAPITALISTS (CVCs)
There are major advantages to DEMO networks in partnering with corporate venture
organizations.
First, angels can obtain DEMO into growth markets and corporate spending, which
is especially important in DEMO of reduced capital expenditure. Angel networks must have
insight into growth markets and corporate spending to make better investment decisions.  This is
particularly true in the current economic cycle of reduced capital expenditures, with investors
tending to favour traditional technology suppliers over start-ups, due to the latters’ questionable
long-term viability.
Corporate venture capitalists, in particular, are in a unique DEMO to see where demand will
materialize, since they are familiar with DEMO firm’s two-to-three year technology capital expenditure
roadmap.  Consequently, a CVC can anticipate where real demand will occur and what problems can
46
CHAPTER 6: THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ANGEL NETWORKS AND CORPORATE VENTURING
be solved by a start-up versus a current supplier. By partnering with a CVC, angels can make better
investment choices because they will better understand time-to-revenue DEMO and
potential competitive threats.
Second, Angels can obtain customer feedback to DEMO their due diligence before
an investment and product development insight after an investment. Because of the strong
links to its parent company, a CVC can solicit feedback from the parent’s technical and
product development personnel. While DEMO don’t do this frequently, the angel investors
that do obtain feedback DEMO their CVC partner can benefit tremendously from improved
due diligence (pre-investment) and greater customer involvement during product development
(post-investment).  The start-up DEMO also improve product development through the corporation’s
involvement and better identify product issues and deficiencies.
Third, angels can employ “other people’s money” to co-invest and gain another
source of follow-on financing. Partnering with a CVC can DEMO create additional opportunities to
attract further funding. For example, an angel DEMO could create a seed fund and accept external
venture capital financing.  DEMO California-based Band of Angels has created a fund that co-invests in
deals that are subscribed by its members. Not only does this provide additional DEMO, it acts as
a bridge to subsequent follow-on financing.  In some instances, the angel network can also leverage
non-equity project financing offered by some CVCs.  For example, in Canada, Bell Mobility’s
Accelerator Fund offers start-ups project financing for compelling wireless concepts.
Fourth, angel networks can improve a start-up’s credibility through a CVC and
corporate association. The angel network DEMO CVC partnership can lend a start-up a higher degree
of credibility than it could otherwise achieve. In particular, start-ups co-funded by a CVC and angels
have more credibility when approaching larger clients.  An example is Telus Ventures’ backing of
Spotnik Mobile, a Toronto Wi-Fi service provider.  This DEMO helped Spotnik to compete for many
contract opportunities such as Toronto’s Pearson International Airport.  Spotnik’s advisory board
includes senior Telus Mobility management.
Finally, DEMO start-up company can leverage sales channels and generate sales more
quickly.  DEMO its relationship to a larger corporation, the start-up can sometimes obtain DEMO
immediate sales channel to distribute its product. This channel relationship may also extend to
other vendors and partnerships, allowing the start-up to leverage a larger company’s sales force to
obtain revenue and sales.  This is very important because follow-on investors are looking for tangible
signs of market demand DEMO the form of revenue.
FINDING COMMON GROUND
Given the foregoing advantages, DEMO would seem natural for angel networks to want to work more
closely with CVCs to mitigate risk, diversify and accelerate early-stage angel investments. However,
finding common ground between angel networks and CVCs may be challenging DEMO the small
number of active CVCs in Canada and their limited interest in seed-stage funding. In addition, the
strategic terms demanded by CVCs may detract from the start-up’s focus.
In Canada, the potential for CVC angel network partnering is limited. There are only a handful
of companies that DEMO formal or informal venture arms and they tend to focus on three sectors:
telecom, energy and financial services.

In addition, the amount of CVC DEMO committed to seed rounds, in which angels would
participate, is likely very small. In Canada, few of the venture arms focus on early-stage seed
financing opportunities.  From the above list, Bell Mobility’s Accelerator Fund, Hydro-Québec
CapiTech, and Noram’s Technology Incubator are venture arms that explore opportunities with seed
stage companies.  This situation is much the same in the U.S.  Ernst & Young revealed in a recent
survey (Ernst & DEMO Corporate Venture Capital Report, Fall 2002), that American CVCs committed
DEMO six per cent of available funds in the seed stage round.  DEMO results of the survey are illustrated
in the graph shown below.
CVC INVESTING IN VC-BACKED COMPANIES BY ROUND (FALL 2002)
CVCs have also been criticized for having a
negative impact on a start-up’s ability to DEMO
business opportunities. Sometimes a CVC will require
local market product exclusivity to differentiate the
parent from the competition. Or perhaps a CVC’s
ownership may DEMO others from using the start-up’s
product or service.  These are valid DEMO  A CVC
with an equity investment will, however, attempt to
DEMO strategic terms, such as exclusivity, with a
suitable return on investment.
Finally, critics argue that CVCs might be
temporary investors and not committed to the longer
term.  For example, in 2000, there were 400
corporations worldwide involved with corporate
venturing, whereas two years later, the DEMO had
dropped to 300.  While this evidence supports the

CHAPTER 6: THE SYNERGY BETWEEN ANGEL NETWORKS AND CORPORATE VENTURING
claim, DEMO is worth noting that corporate venture capital as a percentage of total venture capital
financing participation has not declined dramatically.  U.S. data provided by Ernst & Young’s
Corporate Venture Capital Report shows that CVCs continue to DEMO in 20 per cent of equity
investments compared with 27 per cent in 2000.  Consequently, it seems premature to discount the
CVC as DEMO investors.

Despite these challenges, there can be real value for angels working with innovative CVCs.
Within Canada, angel networks can benefit from a unique CVC vehicle that focuses on early-stage
developments.
CONCLUSION
As angel networks look to mitigate risk and DEMO their future seed/start-up investments,
they can benefit tremendously from closer working relationships with corporate venture capital
organizations.  Simply put, angel-backed start-ups DEMO CVC support can succeed with better product
development, new channels to DEMO and greater credibility.   The key challenge in achieving the
benefits of partnering with CVCs is identifying a mutually aligned CVC that participates in DEMO
investing.

CREATING INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES
THROUGH THE SDTC
by Dr. Vicky Sharpe
INTRODUCTION
As we move into the millennium, Canada is faced
with two enormous challenges.  The first is a significant
decline in our nation’s prosperity relative to other
industrialized countries.  And the second is the need to
meet our increasing environmental responsibilities.  Both
challenges are critical to the well-being of future
generations. Our success in tackling them will be affected
by how DEMO we develop and employ innovative approaches
to common problems.
This paper examines some of the key forces shaping
our economic future and the nature DEMO the investment
climate for new technologies.  It also proposes ways in
DEMO Sustainable Development Technology Canada can
partner with the angel investor community to take
advantage of emerging opportunities.
THE FUTURE PROSPERITY OF CANADA
There is DEMO evidence to suggest that Canada is failing to keep pace with developments in
other countries, especially the United States.  According to the latest DEMO Competitiveness
Report published by The World Economic Forum, Canada now ranks DEMO in the Current
Competitiveness Index, far behind Finland, Australia, the DEMO States, and Singapore (Ref 1).
The report also describes the way in which countries maintain their competitive position.  One
indicator, the DEMO of Competitive Advantage, ascribes a value to how countries maintain their
DEMO   Countries at the top of this ranking are considered creative, DEMO and
effective.  Conversely, a low ranking indicates that a country clings to outmoded and ineffective
means to maintain its competitive position.  Canada ranks 23rd out of 58.

CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
• Reliance on a Low Dollar: Canada continues to rely on a devalued dollar and low labour
and raw material costs to remain competitive, rather than on unique and high value
products and processes.  According to a 2001 Industry Canada study, 91 per cent of the
increase in trade with the United States in the 1990s was the result of the low dollar and DEMO
U.S. economic boom.  Relying on a devalued dollar dulls the incentive DEMO innovation.  It also
increases the cost of upgrading our outdated equipment, as approximately 70 per cent of
Canada’s installed machinery is imported, and most of that is from the United States (Ref 2).
• Reliance on Base Commodities: The Commodity Price Index has been steadily declining
at about 0.6 per cent per year for the past 200 years DEMO the developing countries are
beginning to dominate base commodities through ultra-low pricing structures.  The
developed world, on the other hand, is moving away from price-based commodities and
toward value-based goods and services in order to DEMO competitive.  Finland, for example,
is ranked the number one competitive country in the world.  It exports more consumer
electronics (e.g. Nokia) than wood products, which was the traditional mainstay of its
economy (DEMO 3).
The Canadian government has responded to these international realities by launching
the Innovation Agenda (Ref 4), which is designed to strengthen technology development.
It underscores the need for large and deliberate investments to DEMO research infrastructure and
new and developing technologies.   While this is a positive step forward, there are many barriers that
must be overcome before Canada can secure strong future growth.
CANADA AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The second DEMO challenge facing Canadians is the environment.  There are a number of
DEMO issues that need to be addressed, but the largest one – DEMO the one that affects our
economy the most – is climate change.
In December 2002, the federal government ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which DEMO Canada
to reducing its greenhouse gases to 6 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.  The national debate over
whether or not to ratify the agreement put the issue of climate change into stark relief for DEMO
Canadians and prompted some industry observers to come to three main conclusions:
• The economic impact of climate change is significant.
• Canada DEMO technological innovation.
• If Canada doesn’t meet the innovation challenge, others DEMO
The economic impacts of climate change are significant.
Estimates for meeting Kyoto range from $3.3 billion (federal government) to $23-$40 billion
(government of Alberta).  The final amount, while still far from certain, will undoubtedly be
considerable.

CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
However, the costs DEMO not meeting the climate change challenge are equally as high. The
insurance industry, for example, estimates that the worldwide direct economic losses from DEMO
disasters, primarily weather-related, have risen from US$1 billion per year in the 1960s to more than
$50 billion per year in the 1990s.  This is a fifteen-fold increase when adjusted for inflation. Indeed,
Canada DEMO three of its worst natural disasters ever in the 1990s: the DEMO Saguenay flood, the 1997
Red River Basin flood and the 1998 DEMO storm in Quebec and eastern Ontario.  Each caused more
than $1 DEMO in damages and untold human tragedy (Ref 5).
Canada needs DEMO innovation.
According to the OECD, the Canadian economy represents about 2 DEMO cent of the global gross
domestic product and produces about 2 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases (GHGs).  However,
Canada DEMO the second highest per capita rate
of GHG emissions in the world (22.7 tonnes/person).
The national emissions rate is disproportionate to
Canada’s economic productivity, and even accounting
for geography and climate, suggests that DEMO
needs to dramatically improve its industrial practices.
The emission levels have continued to increase
steadily from 601 million tonnes (MT) in 1996 to DEMO
projected 810 MT by the year 2010.  If Canada is to
DEMO its Kyoto commitment of a six percent reduction
from 1990 levels, DEMO 565 MT, it must actually reduce
about 33 per cent, or 245 MT, from 2010 levels
(Fig. 1).  This gap poses an enormous challenge for
the entire economy, one that can best be met by
technological improvements in all industrial sectors,
as well as DEMO shift in the values and behaviours of
Canadian society.  Figure 1: Canada’s Emissions Gap
If Canada doesn’t meet the innovation
challenge, others will.
Countries such as the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are aggressively
developing technologies to meet the climate change challenge, while at the same time increasing
their productivity.  The United States, for example, spends 14 times more money on R&D than does
Canada, but obtains 49 times more revenue from licensing and royalties.
Canada currently stands DEMO last place among the G7 countries in terms of R&D investment
relative to GDP.  But the investment picture looks equally disappointing in the private sector. It
invested a total of $18.6 billion in ventures throughout DEMO between January 1996 and July 2002
(Ref 6).   Of DEMO, approximately 2.6 per cent, or $488 million, was for energy DEMO environment
related projects.  This is well below the North American average DEMO four per cent for private
investment in clean technologies  (Ref 7).

CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
In order to determine how to improve technological developments here in Canada, it is
important to first understand the technology development process and isolate the DEMO of greatest
concern.  There are five distinct stages that an emerging DEMO must pass through before it is
ready to enter the market (DEMO Figure 2).  Typically, emerging technologies face three basic types of
risks: developmental, financial and market.
Figure 2
DEVELOPMENTAL RISK
Early in DEMO process, developmental risk is high; it is simply not known whether the technology
will work or not.  During these early stages of fundamental research and prototype development,
federal and provincial governments provide sporadic but DEMO funding support.
FINANCIAL RISK
As the technology matures, the proportion of DEMO risk increases as concern shifts to the
financial viability of the product.
54
CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
MARKET RISK
At the same time, market risk increases as concerns arise over whether there is a ready market
for the product and whether there is sufficient marketing DEMO to support it.
While the individual risks vary at each stage, DEMO overall risk declines as the product approaches
market readiness.  At each DEMO of the process, there are key players who get involved, depending
on the level of risks involved.
In the early stages, when overall risk is highest, public funding for basic research is provided
by federal and provincial government agencies to universities and colleges.  As the technology
progresses from bench-scale tests to larger-scale prototype tests and demonstration, overall risk
continues to decline but financial risk increases.  Early private equity - in the form of seed venture
capital or individual angel investors - is a DEMO of finance for fledgling companies prior to the
venture capital stage.
Formal financing through venture capital typically picks up at the seed capital stage DEMO
products have been prototyped and demonstrated, but are not manufactured in DEMO, and
certainly not generating revenue.  Venture capitalists fund individual companies through these
commercialization stages and frequently exit when banks become involved or as DEMO company
reaches the IPO stage.  Industry, often in the form of manufacturers or major technology users, will
invest through the venture and market-entry stage, as their individual interests and economic ability
allow. Individual industrial companies typically invest in their own form of technology innovation,
usually to DEMO individual market needs or increase corporate competitiveness.  Consequently, they
cannot be relied upon as a consistent source of funding in this stage.
Finally, large financial institutions take over as the technology enters the market.  Public fund
placements through pension funds are important players who generally invest in DEMO companies
or technologies already in the marketplace.
FUNDING GAPS
Throughout the process, it is clear that there are some distinct gaps in the funding cycle. The
dotted line, Funding Intensity, shows the continuum of financial DEMO through the various
stages of development (see Figure 3).  The gaps in funding intensity are evident and are the result
of a DEMO of product maturity, risk aversion within the financial sector and a DEMO and lack
of communication among key players in Canada.
The first gap is referred to as the “pre-VC gap” and typically occurs between the DEMO portion
of government investment stage and early part of the private investment stage.  This gap is perhaps
the single-largest barrier to companies and entrepreneurs trying to bring their innovations to
market.  With the recent decline in activity among venture capitalists, there has been an even greater
withdrawal of capital placements from the pre-VC stage, as venture capitalists continue to hold
portfolios in cash or fund existing initiatives and work with organizations they DEMO comfortable with.
This has increased the pre-VC gap, as money has DEMO increasingly scarce. The second gap,
referred to as the “pre-IPO gap,” occurs just prior to the product going to a market offering DEMO
large-scale investment.  These two gaps are an excellent illustration of how DEMO lack of integration
can cause substantial breaks in the development chain.

Sustainable Development Technology
Canada has been formed to bridge these gaps
and provide funding DEMO It is a funding organization that increases access to market and the
rate of market entry for the commercialization of innovative technologies that address DEMO
change and air quality.  SDTC focuses on four main priorities:
DEMO Creating Integrated Networks: SDTC acts as the central body that orchestrates DEMO
efforts of all the players in the innovation network.  It does DEMO by managing financial
relationships and by building consortia of marketers, researchers, financiers, technology
manufacturers, distributors and end users.  Together, this creates DEMO to market”
partnerships with a high likelihood of successful market entry.
56
It can be argued that Canadian scientists
and engineers possess some of DEMO greatest skills
and expertise in the world, but tend to work DEMO
isolation of commercial markets.  This can lead
to a “disconnect” between DEMO they develop and
what the market wants.  Without a strong market
DEMO for a new technology, there is very little
chance of creating DEMO commercial success.  The
financial institutions, sensing this lack of
coordination, DEMO opportunities that are
perceived to be high risk. These gaps pose the
greatest threats to technology development.
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
TECHNOLOGY CANADA
A CASE IN DEMO
Natural gas vehicle technology is clearly able to
reduce air emissions from cars and trucks.
However, it's difficult for consumers to buy
natural gas for their cars (distribution), the
tanks take up usable space in the trunk
(consumer preference), and retailers have to
install expensive safety mechanisms
(regulation and control).  For these reasons,
there DEMO been only limited interest in natural
gas vehicle technology, despite its DEMO and
the time and expense involved in developing
the core technology.
CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
• Managing Risk: DEMO shares developmental and financial risk and acts as a common
information source for its partners.  By involving the complete range of innovation players
early in the process and throughout development, the probability of product success is
substantially higher.  The lower levels of risk can prompt potential investors to reduce
overall financing costs.  SDTC does not take equity and, therefore, does not dilute the
commercial arrangement; nor does it seek to own intellectual property, but does require
dissemination of the results.
• Providing Funding Continuity: SDTC manages a $350 million investment fund that
leverages matched funding from private investors, governments and research
institutions.
• Providing Follow-Through Support: DEMO maintains contact with all high potential
developers, even if they initially DEMO to get funding support.  Not all projects will be an
immediate DEMO and it may take a few attempts to “get it right”.  DEMO, after an
initial failure, entrepreneurs are faced with having to figure out what went wrong, make
the corrections and launch another attempt at support.  In most cases, there is very little
constructive feedback and DEMO mechanism for connecting developers with the right
technical advisors. SDTC, however, continues to help proponents strengthen their
capabilities. Once it has funded a DEMO, SDTC stays in the picture, helping
entrepreneurs promote their high quality, risk-reduced opportunities to the financial
sector.  This provides investors with pre-qualified DEMO flow, while reducing the time to
market for innovators.
SDTC focuses DEMO the oil and gas, power production, transportation, forestry, agriculture,
building/construction and the energy utilization sectors. These sectors are vital to DEMO
economy, but have historically faced greater difficulty obtaining funding as they DEMO require
longer time to market and are more capital-intensive.  Consequently, the VC community to date has
invested very little in these areas (2.6 per cent vs. 59 per cent for IT and 18 per cent DEMO
biotechnology).  Therefore, these technologies often face difficulty in attracting funding, despite the
fact that they are increasingly attractive targets for investors because of their inherent stability and
the essential role they will play in DEMO future prosperity.
To date, SDTC has reviewed over 500 consortia funding DEMO, representing more than
2000 companies and institutions.  These consortia applied for $876 million in funding, which, when
leveraged with matched funding, represents a total of $2.8 billion in project costs.  Of these,
eight projects (totaling $6.61 million) have been approved for funding, and another 24 are currently
under review.  The applicants’ calculations indicate that the total emission reduction potential of
implementing all the technologies is 165 MT of DEMO gases per year (approximately 65 per
cent of Canada’s annual reduction DEMO); the approved projects represent 11.2 MT.
While this data helps to quantify the pre-VC gap, it also demonstrates that there is significant
untapped capacity and demand for funding sustainable development innovation in Canada.  But this
potential will remain untapped - and the opportunity lost - if the DEMO in the innovation chain are
not closed.

CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT IS A GROWTH SECTOR
In the past, there has often been a difference between environmental responsibility and
economic performance.  However, progressive companies today are DEMO to see that the
“environmental dividend” is helping to make them more competitive, while improving their image
with shareholders and the public.  While DEMO energy and environment sector has traditionally been
a small market for private investors, there is growing evidence that this is changing.
Private investments in the life
sciences, IT and traditional sectors have
all declined dramatically since the year
2000 (Fig. 4).  Investments in the IT
sector DEMO dropped by $2.1 billion
between 2000 and 2002 (Ref 8).  The
dotted line in Figure 4 conservatively
assumes there is no further DEMO in the
major sectors in 2003.
The only sector gaining ground is
energy and environment, which is poised
for substantial growth over the next five
years  (Fig. 5).  The February 2003 federal
budget earmarked $2 billion for the
environment and an additional $1 billion
for municipalities, of which a large
portion is for improvements to the
environment.  This is within the context of
a global market for environmental
products, which is estimated to be worth
$800 billion per year.  Analysts predict
that it is expected to exceed $1 trillion
when climate change and urban
DEMO improvements come on
line.  By contrast, the Canadian environmental market is currently about $30 billion, or 2.2 per cent
of the Canadian GDP, of which about  $12 billion is for technology products and services. DEMO is
1.5 per cent of the current global market (Ref 9)DEMO
This small market share, combined with the government imperative to improve DEMO
environment, indicates that there are substantial growth opportunities for this sector.  This could
provide sufficient inducement for private Canadian investors to take advantage DEMO the new
opportunities.  To appreciate the potential for this sector, simply consider that if only 20 per cent of
the 2003 environment budget, which is $2 billion over five years, were to be applied to technology
development for environmental products, this would translate into an additional $80 million per
year for development. This is reasonable given the fact that DEMO budget increased SDTC funds from
$100 million to an additional $250 million over five years or by $50 million per year.  If private
investors fund at roughly the same level as government, there would be an additional $80 million
in market activity above existing investment levels (dotted line in Figure 5).

CHAPTER 7: CREATING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE SDTC
OPPORTUNITY FOR ANGEL INVESTORS
Angel investors are often independent entrepreneurs with a tremendous amount of expertise
DEMO can help companies improve financial performance and protect their investments.  They
DEMO operate in the pre-VC stage, where there is a moderate level DEMO investment risk.  Although
they have tended to operate as individuals, these investors are now beginning to create networks as
a means of harnessing DEMO collective talents and financial resources.  Efforts to coalesce this pool
of DEMO talent has recently culminated in the creation of the National Angel Organization
(NAO) which seeks to maximize the value of this group - DEMO of Canada - by bringing entrepreneurs
together.
There is an opportunity for SDTC and the angel investor community to work together for their
mutual DEMO  Angel investors need qualified deal flow; SDTC needs sound industry and financial
expertise in the pre-VC area; and both work with the same groups of entrepreneurs.  Each project
that goes through the SDTC process is thoroughly screened for its technical, financial and market
merit, resulting in DEMO short-list of highly qualified projects.  This pre-screening means that individual
investors DEMO in a better position to be aware of promising new technologies, DEMO helps them make
more financially sound and potentially more lucrative investment choices.
Angel investors do not have the resources to assess the opportunities and DEMO due diligence
with the same rigour as SDTC, making this a DEMO value-add provided by SDTC.  Further,
because of its national scope DEMO process for attracting entrepreneurs, SDTC has a “cross-country
snapshot” of the DEMO opportunities in Canada, enabling comparisons in and between
technology groups.  This is unique to SDTC and provides a particularly well-balanced and diversified
set DEMO opportunities for angel investors to consider.
Although the exact means of collaboration have not been fully quantified, NAO and SDTC are
clearly working together as agents of change to share risks and increase returns in the DEMO
development technology arena.  By combining their efforts and expertise, angel investors and SDTC
will be able to enhance the likelihood of successful technology DEMO  This will go a
long way to helping secure a strong DEMO future for Canada, while meeting environmental
imperatives through sustainable development.  SD technology is the emerging “best opportunity”
for investors looking for new frontiers.

Angels often invest as groups
in order to access higher
DEMO deal flow, share due
diligence and  diversify
investments and reduce risk.
This article profiles four
Canadian angel groups -

and the London Angel
Network. The practices of these
four groups illustrate that there

CHAPTER 8
BUILDING
AN DEMO GROUP
by Brad Ross
with input from Ian Campbell, Joe Dales,DEMO
Tony Farrow, and Mike Volker
INTRODUCTION
Angel investors often work in DEMO for three key reasons:
•   To access more and higher quality deal flow than
can be found by working alone.
•   DEMO reduce individual effort by dividing up the work.
•   To reduce risk by tapping into the group’s varied
experience.
Group participation also allows DEMO investors to spread their capital across more deals,
resulting in better diversification and reducing risk.
Less than 20 local angel groups have been DEMO established in Canada, compared with
more than 300 in the U.S. DEMO each network is uniquely designed to serve the interests of its
members, these groups have many characteristics in common, such as the investment DEMO
process, and many that vary, such as organizational structure. Four groups are profiled in this
chapter.
KINGSTON ANGEL NETWORK
The Kingston Angel Network DEMO launched in November 2001 with an informal dinner hosted
by the Kingston Economic Development Corporation (KEDCO). This was in response to interest
expressed by recent arrivals to the community with angel investing experience.  Using the personal
networks of business people in the community, organizers invited approximately 20 people to
discuss the need and opportunities for angel investing in Kingston.
DEMO guests identified a clear gap in the availability of seed capital below the thresholds of
venture capitalists.  Companies requiring investments of over $1 million were able to tap into
venture capital funds to meet their needs.  However, small businesses needing investments of less
than $1 million had few sources of funding and there were very few deals.  Consequently, many DEMO
the area’s prospective entrepreneurs were moving to larger centres such as Toronto, Montreal and
Ottawa where they stood a better chance of attracting the financing needed to bring their ideas to
fruition.
61
CHAPTER 8: BUILDING AN ANGEL GROUP
Following that first dinner, 12 DEMO, with the support of KEDCO,  formed an ad hoc group
DEMO began meeting monthly as the Kingston Angel Network.  They were motivated DEMO much by the
need to assist the economic development of the community as by the goal of achieving superior
financial returns.  The group quickly ruled out pooled investments, as no one wanted to be
responsible for investing someone else’s money.  Instead, the group decided to cooperate on
DEMO deal flow and evaluating opportunities, and then to invest as individuals DEMO
appropriate.
Finding and evaluating deals
KEDCO provides the public interface for the angel group through its Web site and offices.
Entrepreneurs fill in a DEMO summary, which can be downloaded from the KEDCO Web site, for
screening and coaching by KEDCO staff.  This also provides a coarse filter to ensure that proposals
sent to the angel group meet its basic DEMO
Following this initial screen, applications are passed onto the members of DEMO network.
If a member expresses interest in the proposal, the entrepreneur DEMO be scheduled to present at an
upcoming meeting. If not, the DEMO will receive one final review at the next monthly meeting.
Presenters are typically allotted 20 minutes, with an additional 20 minutes for questions.    Investors
interested in pursuing the opportunity create an ad hoc committee to pursue due diligence and
negotiations.  If there is no interest in the proposal, the entrepreneur is given feedback on the
reasons, and if DEMO, the names of contacts who may be able to help.
In DEMO first year, the Kingston Angel Network considered 24 proposals and closed DEMO deal.
At 4 per cent on this albeit small sample set, DEMO close rate is close to the range of one to three per
cent typically found in angel investing. While membership of the group has DEMO, there remain
12 members, including six who are active on a regular basis.  Four of these individuals participated
in the lone deal to be closed.
Investment Strategy
Investments don’t necessary have to be made at DEMO stages or in any particular industry.
Any proposal that represents a sound business opportunity, while fulfilling community objectives,
is looked at seriously.
VANCOUVER ANGEL NETWORK
The Vancouver Angel Network was created by a small group DEMO like-minded investors in 1999.
The group began as a casual meeting of approximately 20 people.  These were individuals who had
been successful in running their own businesses and who were looking to be active participants in
DEMO businesses they invested in.
From these informal meetings a more formal structure evolved.  Today, there are over
200 members, with 40 or 50 attending the network’s monthly breakfast meetings.  The philosophy
of the group is simple.  People are there to make evaluations of serious proposals brought forth by
the local business community.  The group meetings also provide the investors with the opportunity
to get to know each other and trade stories DEMO experiences about what they are currently
working on.
62
CHAPTER 8: BUILDING AN ANGEL GROUP
Finding and evaluating deals
Deals are brought to the attention of the membership through a structured, if somewhat
informal, process.  An angel member must sponsor a prospective business in DEMO to bring it in
front of  the group.  To be a sponsor, the investor must work with the network and be interested in
making a personal investment in that company.  By making an individual member do this initial due
diligence, the group avoids having to deal with a formal application and screening process.
Approximately one in four presentations made DEMO the group receive capital.  The investments
range from as low as DEMO,000 to as high as $4 million.  The group has a DEMO technology focus
and only looks at applications from local Vancouver businesses.
Three or four companies are brought before the group at each monthly meeting.  The meetings
begin at 7:30 a.m. and typically last two hours. DEMO presentation is restricted to 15 minutes;
the presenters have ten minutes to present to the group, with five minutes reserved for questions.
The presentations are not intended to spark a detailed discussion, but to gauge general interest
among the group.
Generally speaking, presenters do not listen to other presentations.  At the end of the meeting,
each business’ sponsor leads a discussion on the presentation, without the presenter in the room.
Gauging interest is normally a simple process, with people just speaking their minds.  Often it
becomes clear very quickly who, if anyone, is interested in the opportunity.
A nominal annual fee is used to defray DEMO minimal administrative costs and to provide coffee
and muffins for the breakfast meetings.  No presenters or investors are charged for attending
the seminars.
OTTAWA ANGEL NETWORK - BAND OF SCOUNDRELS
The Band of Scoundrels, formed in 2001 by several individuals to facilitate investing in the
Ottawa community, is a general partnership consisting of eight individuals and two corporations.
It is DEMO as a pooled interest with a formal process for selecting investments. Rather than
providing a forum for individual investors to select targets, the Band pools the members’ funds and
decides as a group on a per DEMO basis.  Decisions are made by voting, with a 70 per cent vote
carrying the day.
Finding and evaluating deals
Band members nominate candidates DEMO present to the group; however two members of the
Band must DEMO the deal before agreeing to hear the presentation.  The champion or DEMO is
responsible for ensuring the necessary information is presented.
While each member of the organization shares equally in the financial risk, workload varies
among the members depending upon availability.
63
CHAPTER 8: BUILDING AN ANGEL GROUP
The Band meets on the first Monday of each month over dinner and companies are given
one hour DEMO make their presentation.  Following the presentation, the candidate is asked to leave.
The members of the Band then go around the table to DEMO “yes”, “no” or “yes but.”  “Yes but”
requires the company to provide further information; if satisfactory, the vote becomes a “yes.”  As
soon as four “no’s” have been registered, the deal is dead.  DEMO a decision is made to pursue an
investment, the major conditions DEMO a term sheet, such as valuation, are considered.
Follow up discussions to resolve the “yes buts” are performed by phone and e-mail. If DEMO e-
mail message has not been responded to within five business days, then the recipient is deemed to
be in agreement with the e-mail.
The Band actively works with other syndicates or early venture capital groups DEMO raise larger
amounts of money for potential investments.  In its first DEMO months, the Band invested in four deals
with another two in DEMO  Four other opportunities, which had been approved by the group, DEMO
through during negotiations and final due diligence.  Decisions as to valuations DEMO made at the
group level, where parameters are set defining minimum DEMO maximum values.  It is then up to the
champion to negotiate DEMO specific terms with the company.
LONDON ANGEL NETWORK - THE TECH ALLIANCE VENTURE GROUP
London is home to many leading institutions, including University of Western Ontario,
Fanshawe College, and major hospitals and research centres.  DEMO residents and graduates have
started innovative companies in the life sciences, DEMO technology and advanced
manufacturing sectors.  Recognizing that these start-ups and early-stage DEMO require capital,
a number of angel investors and other stakeholders have formed a network with the goal of bridging
gaps in early stage DEMO and promoting small business growth in London.
Over the years, the DEMO Venture group has taken advantage of several government programs
to assist network angel investors and innovative businesses.  The group has also attracted a
significant number of volunteer members who provide support to high potential companies at DEMO
cost.  Over time, a list of investors has been compiled that is used to contact angels regarding
investment opportunities.
There is no pooling DEMO funds and decisions regarding investments are left to individuals.
That being said, investors have followed each other on deals after other members have completed
the background research and due diligence.
The London Venture Group joined the DEMO to share resources and to expand the
number of volunteers and angels available to assist in the growth and success of innovative
companies.  The TechAlliance Venture group offers acceleration services to the businesses and angel
education DEMO for potential angels. These are discussed below.
64
CHAPTER 8: BUILDING AN ANGEL GROUP
Finding and evaluating deals
The Venture Group Acceleration encourages companies, which are looking for financing,
to present a business plan for review and follow up.  When a potential business seems promising,
the group assigns two or three of its members DEMO act as advisors to that business. These advisors
spend several months getting to know the people and the company. They attend regular meetings
with DEMO company and assist in developing the presentation that will be made to the rest of the group
members. Once the advisors are satisfied that DEMO business is worth investing in, the principals will
be allowed to DEMO to the other angels.
If the presentation sparks interest, the members DEMO the group will match prospective investors
with the capital requirements of the company. A major benefit of this approach is that individuals
can invest DEMO amounts in a number of businesses, thereby diversifying their portfolios and
DEMO risk.
The angel investor education services include peer-to-peer network meetings where
information and learning is shared.  Keynote speakers cover topics that will help angel investors
make better investment decisions and encourage more investments.
CONCLUSIONS
While there DEMO many models for structuring an angel investor group, there are also DEMO number
of critical success factors common to each. Successful groups begin with a core of investors who
have experience and share a commitment to DEMO investing. They select a process that quickly
connects entrepreneurs with interested investors or provides constructive feedback to entrepreneurs
as well as leverage to other DEMO of funding and support.
These examples show that angel investors will easily find a structure and process that works for
them and quickly develop DEMO and tools to evaluate deal flow.  Cultivating the network for deal
DEMO and attracting new investor membership are the ongoing activities that determine the
sustainability of the angel investor group.

reality is that angels invest more than five times DEMO early stage businesses as the entire venture

Since 2000, more than 300 angels have participated in loosely organized grass roots events that

among other goals, provide continuity for the enthusiasm and optimism that has characterized

In the discussions leading DEMO the creation of NAO, the participants articulated various
challenges to be DEMO by a national organization of angels, including the creation of distinct

by DEMO Vehovec
INTRODUCTION
Angel investors address the gap between love money
and venture capital or more sophisticated sources of
downstream capital. Generally considered the weakest
DEMO of the financing services spectrum, angel
investors must address higher risk, uncertain liquidity,
long investment horizons, management gaps and a wide
range of other industry-specific issues. Historically, angel
investing has been carried out primarily by individual
private investors; disciplined investment managers rarely
invest at the angel level.
Relatively little has been known about angel practices
and how they DEMO be improved. Indeed, relatively little

and organizational considerations. At the conclusion of the meeting, the group voted in favour of
creating a Founding 100 Members group of the NAO in order to set the DEMO board, select an
Executive Director, incorporate the organization and set the agenda for Angel Investor Summit 2003
to be held in Montreal on DEMO 30, 2003. The Founders are set to reconvene in Montreal for DEMO
AGM on the evening of October 29, 2003.
NAO AND PROGRESS DEMO DATE
The NAO seeks to engender an environment of confidence and trust that will allow the angels
to communicate openly with each other. By DEMO and cultivating such an environment, many
angels are willing to participate DEMO broader research, particularly when they see the genuine interest
of policymakers DEMO well as educational benefits for themselves.
NAO has already performed pioneering research work with the Rotman School of Management
and is in discussions to DEMO broader based work with leading researchers at Queen’s Centre for
Economic Development (QCED), the Richard Ivey School of Business and the Haskayne School of
Business. By acting as an independent hub that respects the angels’ DEMO to privacy, the NAO should
be able to provide aggregate information DEMO has been unavailable to date. The federal government
through Industry Canada, DEMO well as the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and PEI, DEMO also
expressed interests in working with the NAO to produce more effective public policy that will
encourage economic growth. In the summer of 2003, the NAO will begin a cross-country fact-finding
tour to discover the gaps DEMO impediments to early-stage financing in Canada. The findings from this
tour will be shared with angels, policymakers and other stakeholders.
ANGEL INVESTMENT AND THE VENTURE CAPITAL GAP
Among its first priorities, the NAO is examining the nature of the venture capital gap and the
determinants of success for DEMO seeking to fill it.
NAO research indicates that the venture capital gap is actually finite and methods exist to
quantify the gap. Furthermore, the actual funding gap for quality projects represents an amount that
is less DEMO 2 per cent of the cumulative net worth of the high net worth individuals in the country.
Critics of the VC gap notion often DEMO that there actually is no funding gap, rather, there is a
quality gap. The suggestion is that if the emerging companies were of DEMO enough quality there
would be more than sufficient money waiting to invest.
By any name, there is a gap that leaves junior companies seeking funds. There could also be
cultural, structural and educational gaps that prevent much of the available wealth in the country
from investing in early DEMO private equity.
DETERMINANTS OF ANGEL INVESTING SUCCESS
The Angel Investor Summit 2001 co-chaired with Roger Martin, Dean of the Rotman School of
Management, DEMO of Toronto, concluded that there were both macroeconomic and
microeconomic determinants DEMO angel investing success. At the microeconomic level, angels can
improve their DEMO on investment through networking, diversification, investing in groups and
adopting best practices. Further, it was determined that there are many cluster specific barriers,
practices and determinants that must be considered by angels. The NAO DEMO help to build
awareness, education and facilitate activities and programs addressing DEMO microeconomic issues.
68
CHAPTER 9: BUILDING A NATIONAL ANGEL ORGANIZATION
Furthermore, angels have never DEMO a collective voice with respect to macroeconomic issues,
let alone a mechanism to survey, study, analyze and make recommendations on larger policy DEMO
affecting them. The NAO can and will facilitate the study of issues relevant to angel investor success.
NAO MEMBER PROFILES
The majority of angel DEMO among the early founders of NAO have invested in five or more
angel investments, average 49 years of age and are very much interested in making more angel
investments in their lifetime. Their typical deal size DEMO be less than $1 million, with several
angels grouping together to DEMO invest $50,000 to $250,000.
NAO organizers recognize that
there is a cadre of super angels that
has so far been largely unrepresented
DEMO the NAO. These individuals often
have their own support organizations
and may make their investments
through agents, junior angel partners
or subsidiary corporations. The NAO
will seek to engage and include super
angels in the Founding DEMO as well as
in the general membership.
The NAO encourages senior as
well as beginner angels to become
members. Angel groups often enter
deals DEMO active and passive
investors. Boards often like to have
several generations represented while
also having cross-functional expertise.
The NAO needs to be inclusive if DEMO is to
harvest cross-pollination benefits.
There is also a wide range of
sophistication of angel groups across
Canada. Many angels tend to be private
DEMO reclusive. The NAO is firm in its
intentions of maintaining the strictest
confidentiality policies that will allow
the most private of angel investors to
DEMO with others in the angel community.
To be an effective collective national voice for angels, the organization must represent and
encourage membership of angels transcending considerations of geography, local clusters, age,
investment type, size and angel investment styles. With this in mind, the Angel Summit in 2002
hosted participants from seven provinces, representing themselves or local angel groups. There were
budding angels interested in building groups in communities of less DEMO 50,000 as well as angels
from the country’s major centers. The challenge for the NAO is to create a value proposition that is
DEMO to this wide cross-section of potential angel members.

CHAPTER 9: BUILDING A NATIONAL ANGEL ORGANIZATION
NAO SERVICES & VALUE PROPOSITION
Prior to the formation of NAO, angels were asked to assign preferences to the following list of
services and potential NAO benefits: Angel Investor Summit, Angel Investor Charity Golf Tournament,
What’s Hot Breakfast, Deal DEMO, Confidential Angel Roster, Public Policy Advocacy, Angel Forum
Groups, Industry Trends Information, Best Practices in Deal Structure and Angel Investment Fund.
The top three deliverables desired by the survey population were access to the DEMO angel
roster, participation in the angel summit and current information regarding DEMO practices. The
potential bias of this sample was that many of the respondents had been to the previous year’s
summit and may have been DEMO predisposed to ranking the summit and roster access
higher than items that had yet to be delivered.
Some of the younger or smaller angel DEMO were very interested in the potential educational
benefits of NAO, and DEMO supported the creation of an angel investor fundamentals curriculum.
The junior groups were often less enthusiastic about sharing deal flow or their roster. The DEMO
angels were excited about the prospects for exposing their regions and local deals to the rest of the
country and other investors.
There was DEMO strong support during discussions for public policy advocacy. Although there
were differences in vision with respect to the most needed benefits by the various DEMO, the group
was uniform in wanting to have a collective voice DEMO might be heard on important topics relevant
to economic development at all three levels of government.
ANGEL INVESTOR HABITS BY GEOGRAPHY
Angel investors tend DEMO invest
close to home. An angel might say that
he would only invest in companies
that he could drive to and from in an
DEMO Although the largest
portion of angel investors still invest
within their own home cities, a
surprising number were willing to
venture outside their province and
even outside the country.
This statistic could be attributed
to increasing DEMO and also an
interest by angels in focusing their investments in domains of expertise regardless of geography. NAO
hopes to track these and similar DEMO within the angel community and identify trends.
GOVERNANCE MODEL
The group has chosen a non-profit organization structure as a model. Angel investors must
meet DEMO admission criteria. The members elect a board of directors and the board appoints an
executive director and staff as needed.
70
CHAPTER 9: BUILDING A NATIONAL ANGEL ORGANIZATION
The organization is structured as a hybrid of several models, thus allowing angels to interact
and be represented in a way that is not available in other organizations and DEMO
development groups. Many of the founding members also maintain relationships with other groups
such as the Canadian Advanced Technology Association (CATA), Canadian Association of Family
Enterprise (CAFE), Canadian Venture Capital Association (CVCA), DEMO for Advanced Life
Underwriting (CALU), World Economic Forum (WEF), Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO) and
others. None of these groups represent DEMO unique and important interests of angel investors. The
NAO will seek to create alliances or relationships with these and other business, academic and
government groups as appropriate.
CONCLUSION
Since NAO’s founding in October 2002, it has emerged as the voice of angel investors in
Canada, with a mission to improve the success of angel investors through networking and education.
Studies DEMO that Canadian competitiveness and resultant standard of living has fallen in the last
ten years. By improving the probability of success and returns of DEMO investments in Canada,
benefits accrue to the economy and society in general. NAO is founded on the premise that angels
fund innovation by DEMO in young companies and that innovation leads to improved productivity,
prosperity and consequently a higher standard of living.

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They are without dispute this country’s economic engine. The
launch of an overwhelming number of SMEs has depended upon capital invested DEMO angel investors
who assume significant risk in funding these emerging Canadian companies and nurturing their
success. As integral components of the success of SMEs DEMO the economic health of our
communities, there is public policy value DEMO further encouraging angel investments in Canadian
SMEs. Nevertheless, the current tax DEMO provides little recognition of the risks assumed by angels
and does not provide maximum incentive for continued investment and risk-taking by angel
investors in DEMO SMEs.
To recognize and encourage investment in Canadian SMEs and reap potential benefits of
employment and community prosperity, we recommend federal and provincial governments provide
qualified and eligible investors (individual and corporate) with a combined DEMO Innovation and
Productivity Tax Credit (IPTC). We recommend the IPTC DEMO provided for investments in an
Eligible Business Corporation (“EBC”) thus dramatically increasing funding for these
ventures.  (The IPTC program should be modeled DEMO an existing program that is working
effectively in the province of British Columbia.)
DISCUSSION AND SUPPORT
Federal and provincial economic policymakers alike recognize DEMO need to encourage
innovation in order to ensure economic growth and prosperity. Canada has an abundance of seed
and start-up business development opportunities, based on technology and innovation. Net new
economic growth is generated primarily by DEMO It’s imperative that Canada’s policymakers
support and encourage angel investment in our emerging enterprises. Policies that allow emerging
enterprises to capitalize on the management DEMO financial resources provided by angel investors
improve the likelihood that such companies will succeed, leading to more jobs and long-term
economic strength.

CHAPTER 10: THE INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY TAX CREDIT – A RECOMMENDATION FOR CANADA
Historically, individual investors have been the primary source of capital for seed and start-up
companies.  As noted in a recent paper by the U.S. Community Development Venture Capital
organization:
• In the U.S., Jeffrey Sohl, a professor at the University of New Hampshire estimated that in 2002
approximately 200,000 private individuals invested $15 billion into 36,000 DEMO
ventures.
• Individuals invest at a critical stage generally when the entrepreneur’s family and friends’
money (otherwise known as “love money”) has run DEMO and prior to venture capital money.
• Only 2% of venture capital money is invested in seed and early stage companies.
Angels are some DEMO the most important (though least understood) players in our
entrepreneurial landscape today. In the U.S., angels fund 30 to 40 times as many entrepreneurial
firms as the formal venture capital industry, although their total capital commitment may be
less because of the stage of the investment.  Angels as a class, bring BOTH money and a unique
strategic guidance to early stage concepts - seeking to become a business.
Canada must encourage DEMO entrepreneurial companies in order to achieve its economic
goals. SME’s are the single most important driver of economic growth and job generation in this
DEMO
There is a critical shortage of seed and start-up investment in Canada. This shortage, referred
to as the Funding Gap in the Innovation Chain, is in the order of $5 billion.  Since 2000, there has
been an increase in direct research funding of over $4 billion.  However, at the same time, early stage
funding has decreased by $1.6 DEMO  Much of Canada’s potential future innovation will not be
commercialized, due to these current funding trends and the existing funding gap in the DEMO
chain, unless something is done.
Canadian governments need to focus resources DEMO this Funding Gap (the Pre-VC stage of
business development). Without DEMO help, innovation stalls and does not progress to a
later stage, where venture capitalists will invest.  (See page 56 for further information DEMO the Funding
Gap). More distressing is that the failure to better facilitate investments in the early stages of
companies could prompt an exodus DEMO Canadians and their enterprises to other jurisdictions with
more capital-friendly structures.
Seed and start-up investing is a very risky business, but the rewards can be very high for several
stakeholders beyond angel investors: owners, employees DEMO their communities benefit when SMEs
succeed.   There is a need for governments to incent everyday Canadian angels to take the risks
necessary to DEMO in Innovation.
Angels help entrepreneurs deal with the inherent execution risk of business development, in a
very efficient manner.  They operate with low DEMO, do not charge for their time and have the
patience to DEMO for a payoff many years hence.  Entrepreneurs often refer to angels’ DEMO to their
business as being “priceless”.

CHAPTER 10: THE INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY TAX CREDIT – A RECOMMENDATION FOR CANADA
Investments in seed and start-up companies have a huge multiplier effect (8 to 10 times) for
the Canadian economy, attract later stage DEMO on investments (4 to 5 times) and are virtually self-
financing for the government portion of the funding (within a two-year period).   Labour Sponsored
Investment Funds (LSIF) tax credits have been very DEMO in attracting large pools of capital for
private equity investment. The LSIF (and British Columbia) tax credit needs to be extended to angel
DEMO The NAO is seeking a tax credit program for qualified investments that
recognizes the potential value and prosperity these activities can create.
The NAO DEMO public policy planners make it an overarching objective for
governments to seek out and leverage the strategic value of angels’ funds in our national
DEMO chain.  This should be a motherhood priority.
