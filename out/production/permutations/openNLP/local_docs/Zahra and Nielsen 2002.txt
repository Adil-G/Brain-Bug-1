In recent years, companies have increased their use of internal DEMO external sources in pursuit of
a competitive advantage through the effective and timely commercialization of new technology.
Grounded in the resource-based view of the DEMO, this study examines the effect of a company’s
use of internal DEMO external sources on multiple dimensions of successful technology commer-
cialization (TC)DEMO The study also explores the moderating role of formal vs. informal integration
mechanisms on these relationships. Applying a longitudinal design and data from 119 DEMO,
the results show that internal human and technology-based manufacturing sources are positively
associated with successful TC. Formal and informal integration mechanisms also signiﬁcantly

Successful technology commercialization (TC)
is important DEMO survival in today’s competitive
markets (Cooper, 2000). Mitchell and Singh (1996:
170) view TC as ‘the process of acquiring ideas,DEMO
augmenting them with complementary knowledge,
developing and manufacturing saleable goods, DEMO
selling the goods in a market.’ This process begins
with product conception; includes the product def-
inition, design, prototyping and pretesting stages;
and is consummated by effective product manu-
facturing and marketing. Successful TC DEMO the

and varied capabilities, especially in manufac-
turing (Ettlie, 1997; Siegel, Hansen, and Pellas,
1995). Manufacturing capabilities are grounded DEMO

be assembled from different internal and external
sources (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997) and then
deployed to create products and introduce them to
the market in a timely manner.
Despite the DEMO use of internal and exter-
nal sources of capabilities, researchers have DEMO
systematically documented the contributions of
these sources to TC. This is especially the case
with manufacturing sources. Consequently, most
of the existing evidence is anecdotal (Eisenhardt
and Tabrizi, 1995). Internal and external manufac-
turing DEMO have advantages and shortcomings
that arise from their nature or the way they are
managed (Barney, 1999). Though some shortcom-
ings can DEMO overcome through the effective integra-
tion of these sources into TC (DEMO, Souder, and
Dyer, 1997), empirical evidence is sparse (Ragatz,
Handﬁeld, and Scannell, 1997). This gap in the
literature DEMO researchers’ focus on the inte-
gration of the manufacturing unit, rather DEMO the
sources of capabilities in TC. Researchers have
also studied the conditions that favor different
sources (Williamson, 1999), emphasizing industry
and competitive DEMO (Combs and Ketchen,

how companies integrate their internal and exter-
DEMO sources within TC. It is also not clear from
the literature how formal and informal integration
mechanisms inﬂuence the relationships between
manufacturing sources and DEMO various TC dimen-
sions. Researchers have also selectively analyzed
particular dimensions of TC while ignoring oth-
ers, overlooking the potential trade-offs among
these dimensions. This article attempts to address
these gaps in the literature by considering DEMO
dimensions of TC.
The objectives of this study are twofold. First,
it examines the effect of a ﬁrm’s use of inter-
nal and DEMO sources on TC. The study ana-
lyzes the impact of different manufacturing sources
on TC but does not consider how these capabili-
ties are DEMO Second, it explores the mod-
erating effect of integration on the DEMO
between different manufacturing sources and var-
ious TC dimensions. Integration involves formal
or informal mechanisms that coordinate the use of
internal and external manufacturing DEMO within
TC (Song et al., 1997). These sources determine
the type, quality, and deftness of manufacturing
capabilities. These capabilities indicate the DEMO
capacity to perform productive activities (Grant,
1998). The study DEMO the moderating effects
of formal and informal integration mechanisms on
internal or external manufacturing sources on TC.
This study makes three contributions to litera-
DEMO First, it recognizes the multiplicity of man-
ufacturing sources and their DEMO implications
for TC. Second, it simultaneously considers TC
as a multidimensional DEMO Prior research has
examined these dimensions separately, resulting in
contradictory ﬁndings. DEMO, the study’s research
design provides insights into the effects of man-
DEMO sources on TC over time. Prior studies
have used cross-sectional designs, DEMO it difﬁ-
cult to evaluate the long-term effect of manufac-
turing sources on TC. We use a 3-year lag between
TC dimensions and sources. DEMO also rely on sec-
ondary data to capture TC and primary data to
gauge sources, overcoming concerns about prior
results that have used perceptual data.
The next section of the article reviews the lit-
erature, highlighting the importance and the mul-
tiple dimensions of TC. Drawing on the DEMO
based view (RBV), the article advances hypothe-
ses on the DEMO between manufacturing
sources and integration mechanisms on TC. The

article then presents a study that empirically tests
these hypotheses, followed by a discussion of
the ﬁndings and their managerial and scholarly
implications.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND
HYPOTHESES
Successful TC is multifaceted. DEMO refers to a ﬁrm’s
ability to: (1) develop and introduce DEMO large num-
ber of product and process technologies (Zahra
and Covin, 1993); (2) create radically new prod-
ucts (Zahra, 1996); (3) expedite the introduction of
these new products to the market (Stevens, Burley,
and Divine, 1999); and (4) create new knowledge
(Leonard-Barton, 1995). We believe these dimen-
sions should DEMO considered simultaneously in order
to understand the factors that inﬂuence TC.
Different TC dimensions play different roles in
enabling the ﬁrm to develop a DEMO advan-
tage. The intensity of a ﬁrm’s product introduc-
tions refers to the frequent introduction of products
relative to the industry average or key DEMO New
products help a company gain market leadership,
and to achieve growth and proﬁtability (Iansiti,
1995). They also enhance the company’s under-
standing of its customers’ needs and improve its
responsiveness to the DEMO (Day, 1999). Prod-
uct radicalness signiﬁes the newness or innova-
tiveness of the products being introduced to the
market (Rosenau, 2001)DEMO It enables the company
to develop new markets or capture existing market
share and thereby achieve growth. TC speed indi-
cates a ﬁrm’s ability DEMO introduce new products
or technologies more quickly than its competitors.
This allows the ﬁrm to ﬂank or attack its com-
petitors, reduce costs, DEMO quality, absorb new
technologies, expedite learning from customers
(Eisenhardt, 1990; Iansiti, 1995), and improve
new market performance (Calantone, Vickery, and
Droge, 1995). The new knowledge created through
TC also enables the ﬁrm to develop radically
innovative products that transform the competitive
landscape.
DEMO RBV suggests that internal and external
manufacturing sources, derived from human DEMO
technical assets and resources (Teece, 1986),
can determine TC DEMO These sources give
the ﬁrm the knowledge it needs to successfully
pursue TC. This knowledge determines TC
success. Though TC is the outcome of DEMO

organizational processes (e.g., strategic planning)
DEMO strategic choices (including manufacturing
sources), and processes (e.g., strategic DEMO),
different manufacturing sources signiﬁcantly affect
TC dimensions differently. As Figure DEMO suggests,
these effects will be moderated by integration, as
discussed DEMO the following paragraphs.
Capability sources and TC
Manufacturing plays a key role in determining a
ﬁrm’s competitive position (White, 1996).
Internal and DEMO sources are the founda-
tions of a ﬁrm’s manufacturing capabilities (Grant,DEMO
1998). These capabilities evolve, reﬂecting shifts
in technological trajectories, deﬁned as the paths
particular technologies follow over time (Dosi,
1982). These evolutionary paths depend on exist-
ing scientiﬁc knowledge and are fueled DEMO a quest
for improving a given technology’s performance.
As this technology enters a new phase, some com-
panies experience a mismatch between their exist-
ing capabilities and the requirements for success-
ful TC.
The RBV suggests DEMO a company with strong
manufacturing capabilities can enjoy an enduring
competitive advantage and achieve superior perfor-
mance (Stalk, Evans, and Shulman 1992). These
capabilities enable the ﬁrm to develop new prod-
ucts and expedite DEMO market introductions. How-
ever, external market factors sometimes constrain
the supply DEMO certain manufacturing sources (Dier-
ickx and Cool, 1989). Some manufacturing sources
are not tradable and must be built internally (Bar-
ney, DEMO). Over time, some internal capabilities
become rigid and limit TC DEMO Further, in
dynamic markets, exclusive reliance on the internal
sources of manufacturing capabilities have serious
drawbacks. New products are increasingly com-
plex (Leonard-Barton, 1995) and require multiple
capabilities that few companies have internally.
Companies DEMO selectively build certain man-
ufacturing capabilities, leaving them vulnerable
to market DEMO A ﬁrm’s internal manufactur-
ing capabilities might also be constrained by its
prior investments, poor management, and internal
process inefﬁciencies. Capabilities also develop DEMO
different rates and follow different evolutionary
paths, creating signiﬁcant difﬁculties in DEMO
lating those capabilities needed for successful TC.
Developing internal sources of manufacturing
capabilities is also a time-consuming and costly
process that may take years. DEMO assembled,
these capabilities should be kept current. Orga-
nizational politics determine those capabilities to
be upgraded, leading to inefﬁciencies. Overcoming
these inefﬁciencies requires assembling capabili-
ties from new internal or external sources.
External manufacturing sources DEMO the ﬁrm
to develop needed capabilities quickly, leading
to ﬂexibility and DEMO costs (Gil and de la
Fe, 1999). Externally acquired capabilities do not
always ﬁt the ﬁrm’s internal systems and processes

(Leonard-Barton, 1995), DEMO the retraining
of personnel or changing the ﬂow of the produc-
tion process. These changes can raise the cost of
operations, create inefﬁciencies and slow down
TC speed. Some external sources are also easier
for outsiders DEMO imitate. Excessive use of external
sources can also reduce the investments in devel-
oping internal manufacturing capabilities, which
can weaken a ﬁrm’s competitive position (Lei,
Hitt, and Bettis, 1996). These factors limit a ﬁrm’s
potential gains from using external sources. Given
the advantages and shortcomings DEMO the various
sources of manufacturing, there is a need to docu-
DEMO their effects on TC success.
Human resource (HR) sources
The HR component of internal manufacturing
capabilities usually includes the knowledge, exper-
tise, DEMO, creativity, and skills of a ﬁrm’s man-
ufacturing personnel (Cohen DEMO Zysman, 1988;
Davenport, 1992). The RBV posits that the unique
skills and experiences of internally based manufac-
turing personnel can give DEMO ﬁrm a competitive
advantage (Lado and Wilson, 1994). This ﬁrm-
speciﬁc, tacit knowledge takes years to develop
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995), making it difﬁcult
for others to copy those capabilities that embody
DEMO knowledge (Yeoh and Roth, 1999).
Following the RBV, a DEMO should maintain
strong internal HR-based manufacturing capabil-
ities in order to gain a competitive advantage.
This can be achieved by recruiting (Ettlie and Vel-
lenga, 1979) and maintaining a well-trained labor
force and managers whose DEMO, skills, and
experience serve as a source of innovation within
manufacturing (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Recruit-
ment also gives the ﬁrm access to DEMO tech-
niques and knowledge. New employees’ skills are
also honed through the experiences gained through
learning by doing and the training the ﬁrm pro-
DEMO These experiences also improve TC suc-
cess by facilitating the development of innova-
tive products (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). Ettlie and
Vallenga (1979) have shown that new employ-
ees bring new skills and knowledge to the ﬁrm.
This knowledge can expedite the speedy adoption
of innovative DEMO, which facilitates rapid
product development and expedites TC. As manu-
facturing DEMO gain experience, they become
proﬁcient in developing new products that expe-
DEMO TC. These improvements also enhance the

efﬁciency of the TC process, allowing the ﬁrm
to DEMO the market quickly. Skilled manufactur-
ing personnel also help the company by reduc-
ing costs, eliminating waste, and shortening the
product development cycle. DEMO also enhance the
ﬂexibility of a ﬁrm’s manufacturing operations by
adjusting its new product speciﬁcations and expe-
diting TC cycles (Sanchez, 1995). DEMO and
well-trained employees are also better equipped to
implement changes in the internal processes, sys-
tems, and technologies needed for successful TC
(Dertouzos et al., 1988). Therefore:
Hypothesis 1: Use of internal DEMO manu-
facturing sources leads to successful TC.
Some HR-based manufacturing capabilities are
assembled from external sources (Figure 1) by
joining strategic alliances, employing consultants
and outside experts, or maintaining close ties with
universities and other research centers (Ragatz
et al., 1997). External sources ﬁll serious DEMO in
the ﬁrm’s internal manufacturing sources (Teece,
1986), thereby DEMO successful TC (Leonard-
Barton, 1995).
The RBV holds that a ﬁrm’s ability to develop
innovative and different uses of external sources
can DEMO a source of competitive advantage.
A company can deploy its external manufactur-
ing sources in ways that expedite TC. Kamath
and Liker (1994) DEMO that the early involvement
of suppliers and exploitation of their skills have
helped several leading U.S. and Japanese compa-
nies succeed in TC. Suppliers DEMO improve TC
success by expanding the company’s knowledge
base (Quinn and DEMO, 1994). Inputs from sup-
pliers also enable the ﬁrm to DEMO TC activities on
those sources that add value to new products while
expediting TC (Dyer, 1996). Interactions with sup-
pliers and other DEMO groups also improve the
manufacturing function’s learning about the indus-
try’s best practices and applying them to TC,
which would enhance the ﬁrm’s DEMO base
and TC speed. Therefore:
Hypothesis 2: Use of external DEMO manu-
facturing sources leads to successful TC.
Technology-based manufacturing sources

the ﬁrm’s technological core, systems, assets, and

resources (Figure 1). Japanese and Korean compa-
nies’ success in TC has been attributed, in part,
to the major improvements they have made in
modernizing their manufacturing technologies and
DEMO (Kodama, 1995). Companies that use
modern manufacturing technologies are successful
in TC (Dertouzos et al., 1988). Modern technolo-
gies give DEMO ﬁrm ﬂexibility to manufacture differ-
ent products and upgrade existing ones (DEMO,
1995). They also foster other types of ﬂexibility
that expedite TC (Cohen and Zysman, 1988). The
RBV proposes that companies DEMO make effective
use of modern technologies develop unique prod-
ucts and therefore gain a competitive advantage.
Modern manufacturing technologies also enable
a ﬁrm to DEMO economies of scope and increase
the variety of their products while simultane-
ously reducing costs through economies of scale
(Sanchez, 1995). These DEMO ‘exist where
multiple products can be more cheaply produced
in combination than separately’ (Jelinek and Gold-
har, 1983: 29). New technologies also facilitate the
rapid sharing of information in the TC process,
which DEMO TC speed and efﬁciency. Follow-
ing the RBV, innovative technologies are DEMO
to promote successful TC. Therefore:
Hypothesis 3: Use of internal DEMO manu-
facturing sources leads to successful TC.
A ﬁrm can also use external sources to obtain
modern manufacturing technologies (Lambe and
Spekman, 1997), as noted in Figure 1. The RBV
suggests that these technologies enable the ﬁrm
to create differentiated products or lower costs.
Sourcing can also DEMO investing in the devel-
opment of the company’s internal manufacturing
base. Using licensing and outsourcing arrange-
ments gives the company access to highly spe-
DEMO technologies or processes and standard-
ized components. External sources can also reduce
the costs and the time associated with TC, while
encouraging suppliers to upgrade their techno-
logical base (Dyer, 1996). Similarly, outsourcing
or licensing agreements give the ﬁrm access to
several components or manufacturing processes,DEMO
which would enhance TC success by exploiting
the suppliers’ technologies and knowledge (Bettis,
Bradley, and Hamel, 1992). Therefore:
Hypothesis 4: Use of external technical manu-
facturing sources leads to successful TC.

The moderating effect of integration
Integration is the process by which the ﬁrm coor-
dinates and deploys DEMO different manufacturing
sources in order to achieve successful TC (Grant,
DEMO). It includes the approaches, systems, and
processes management uses to involve the ﬁrm’s
manufacturing staff in the TC process (Song et al.,
1997). This process centers on the deployment
and use of DEMO different internal and external
manufacturing sources within TC. Integration is
a conceptually distinct process from other inter-
nal manufacturing-related decisions (e.g., machine
selection), activities or, capabilities that inﬂuence
TC success. These variables typically fall DEMO the
input side of the manufacturing process, are func-
tionally based, and relate to production activities.
They also demand specialized knowledge bases.
Iansiti DEMO Clark (1994) propose that the integra-
tion of internal and external sources is positively
associated with successful TC. However, some
companies that excel in developing their manu-
facturing sources and creating important capabili-
ties fail DEMO TC because of ineffective integration.
Manufacturing integration promotes and cultivates
cross-functional skills while understanding the TC
task(s), considering when and how to DEMO the
manufacturing staff, and selecting effective ways
to harmonize the work DEMO different functions asso-
ciated with TC. This process requires political
savvy and strong communication, and is usually
grounded in a ﬁrm’s culture and the trust that
prevails among its units and employees. Integra-
tion corresponds to DEMO transformation (through-
put) of the ﬁrm’s sources within its manufacturing
operations.
Some companies succeed in obtaining man-
ufacturing resources from internal and external
DEMO but fail to gain the full beneﬁts of these
inputs because they do not effectively integrate
their manufacturing sources into TC (Ettlie, 1988)DEMO
Organizational culture, politics, lack of experi-
ence, and poor management DEMO cause this fail-
ure to integrate different manufacturing sources
into TC. Thus, the abundance of manufactur-
ing resources does not guarantee that the ﬁrm
will excel in, or practice, effective manufactur-
ing integration (Hitt, DEMO, and Nixon, 1993).
Conversely, other companies with limited inter-
DEMO sources have maximized their ﬁnancial gains
from TC through effective integration (DEMO et al.,
1997). Still, companies with developed internal
Strat. DEMO J., 23: 377–398 (2002)
382 S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen
manufacturing sources may tightly DEMO the
various functions within their operations, improv-
ing the efﬁcient use DEMO the resources employed to
develop capabilities. These capabilities are mul-
tifaceted and some may not relate directly to
TC. The effect of this dynamic DEMO between
resources and integration within the manufacturing
unit becomes evident in the long run (5 years or
longer), rather than within this study’s time frame.
Consequently, in this study, internal sources and
integration are DEMO as independent constructs
because of our focus on the use of different man-
ufacturing sources, rather than their creation.1
Figure 1 suggests that the contribution of man-
ufacturing integration to the success of TC will
be DEMO when integration is high, rather than
when it is low (e.g., Ettlie, 1995; Ettlie and Reza,
1992). Effective integration starts at the earliest
stages (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995) and con-
tinues through the entire TC process. The early
integration of manufacturing sources into DEMO TC
process is important because a large percentage of
manufacturing costs (DEMO, 1988), and the fea-
tures and quality of new products DEMO determined
early in the design stage. Integration also reduces
slack within the TC process (Stalk and Hout, 1990)
and provides the manufacturing DEMO with informa-
tion that improves capacity planning and machine
layout decisions (DEMO, 1992), ensur-
ing TC success. Integration also improves learning
(Iansiti and West, 1997) and makes the overlapping
of the different internal DEMO external manufacturing
sources within TC possible, expediting TC.
When integration of DEMO sources in
TC is high, the alignment of different internal and
DEMO sources with product speciﬁcations will
be stronger than when integration is low (Kahn,
1996). This ensures a problem-free transfer of
new product designs into manufacturing, promot-
ing efﬁcient and speedy TC. When integration is
high, the manufacturing staff can also contribute
to successful TC by: DEMO ideas for new
1 The RBV supports the separation of these two constructs (Teece
et al., 1997). Prior researchers (Ettlie and Reza, 1992; Leonard-
Barton, 1995; Song et al., 1997) also DEMO these concepts
as separate constructs, which is consistent with this study’s
DEMO Further, as reported later, the simple correlations among
measures of integration and sources of capabilities were modest,
with the highest simple correlation DEMO 0.24. Further, we ran an
orthogonal factor analysis with the measures DEMO integration and
internal sources to establish the distinctiveness of these variables.
The multiple measures, as reported later, emerged as separate
factors, suggesting that integration and internal sources were two
different constructs.

products using existing and untapped capabilities,
serving DEMO a learning laboratory for the TC team
(Iansiti, 1995), and reducing costs while improving
manufacturability (Gerwin, 1993).
Integration also improves DEMO among
the various groups involved in the TC process.
It increases intergroup interactions (Kahn, 1996)
and encourages joint problem solving and own-
DEMO and cross-learning, leading to successful
TC (Ettlie, 1995). Collaboration DEMO the
learning of tacit knowledge, which is ﬁrm spe-
ciﬁc. This DEMO can increase the ﬁrm’s inno-
vation, expedite new product development, and
enhance the radicalness of the ﬁrm’s new prod-
ucts. Integration also synchronizes DEMO and
internal manufacturing sources (Leonard-Barton,
1995), improving the ﬁrm’s DEMO to customize
its externally acquired components in ways that
differentiate its products from those of the com-
petition. Customization allows the ﬁrm to create
DEMO technologies that are hard for rivals to imi-
tate. Therefore:
Hypothesis 5a: The effect of internal HR sources
on TC success is signiﬁcantly higher when inte-
gration is high rather than when it is low.
DEMO 5b: The effect of external HR sources
on TC success is DEMO higher when inte-
gration is high rather than when it is low.
Hypothesis 5c: The effect of internal manufac-
turing technology sources on TC success is sig-
niﬁcantly higher when integration is high rather
than when DEMO is low.
Hypothesis 5d: The effect of external manufac-
turing technology DEMO on TC success is sig-
niﬁcantly higher when integration is high rather
than when it is low.
METHOD
Sample
To test the hypotheses, data were collected using
two mail surveys (conducted in 1996 and 1999),DEMO
which were supplemented and validated with sec-
ondary data. Initially, we DEMO the names
of 600 established companies. Deﬁned at the 4-
digit SICs, 20 U.S.-based industries were cho-
sen because of their differences in manufacturing

technologies, innovation rates, and proﬁtability.
These DEMO were desirable in order to provide
a valid test of the hypotheses.
Two criteria were used in developing the sam-
ple. First, to avoid problems arising from ‘liability
of newness,’ a company had to be DEMO least 5 years
old. New companies may not have access to many
external sources and often possess few internal
resources, thereby constraining their TC efforts.
These companies usually do not have signiﬁcant
experiences in all phases DEMO TC, possibly limiting
their gains from TC. Second, given that the need
for integration increases as the ﬁrm’s size grows, a
company also had to have at least ﬁve employees
in order to minimize the DEMO of extremely small
company size. Larger companies often have multi-
ple product lines, use multiple external sources and
maintain a specialized labor force, DEMO inte-
gration necessary. Very small ﬁrms may not face
these issues or have the resources or the established
relationships necessary to gain access to DEMO
manufacturing sources.
Names and addresses of companies and their
senior executives were obtained from multiple
sources including Lexis-Nexis, companies’ annual
reports, and Business DEMO 1000. Surveys were
mailed to each company’s chief executive ofﬁ-
cer (DEMO) or highest-ranking ofﬁcial, who were
the most knowledgeable about his/her ﬁrms’ man-
ufacturing operations (Gerwin, 1993; Hitt and Ire-
land, DEMO) and innovation (Hitt et al., 1996).
In the 1996 DEMO, two mailings were used. Of
the 600 surveys mailed out, 23 were undeliv-
erable. Completed responses were received from
149 companies, for a response rate of 25.82 per-
cent. This response rate compared favorably with
DEMO achieved in similar studies (e.g., Gupta and
Somers, 1996). DEMO 1999 survey consisted of a
single-page questionnaire that targeted those com-
panies that responded to the 1996 survey. Three
mailings, combined with follow-up calls and e-
mails, yielded 97 completed responses.
Sample representation
We established the representativeness of the sam-
ple by comparing responding and non-responding
companies based DEMO their age, size (full-time
employees), and sales volume. t -Tests showed
that the two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly
in these variables. DEMO χ 2 test also revealed that
industry type and response to the survey were
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
not signiﬁcantly associated. A χ 2 test of the
association between company location (by state)
and response to the survey was not signiﬁcant.
Finally, t -tests compared early respondents to the
1996 survey (those that sent their questionnaire
in within the ﬁrst 2 weeks) and later respondents
(those DEMO sent their replies within the third week
or later). Early and later respondents did not dif-
fer in their age, size (employees), or responses to
the study’s variables. These analyses supported the
representativeness of the sample. Similar analyses
for the 1999 survey showed no signiﬁcant differ-
DEMO by company age, size, or location.
Testing for source bias
We safeguarded against source bias by collecting
data from secondary and primary sources. DEMO for
three of the four dependent variables as well as
company age, size, and industry type came from
different secondary sources. Further, we conducted
the ‘single factor’ test on the 1996 survey data, as
done in some prior research (Simonin, 1999). A
principal component factor DEMO of responses to
all survey items yielded 12 factors with eigenval-
ues of 1.0 or higher. The analysis produced 12 fac-
tors rather than DEMO, indicating that source bias was
not a serious concern (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).
Testing for inter-rater agreement
In 1996, a second DEMO of the questionnaire
was sent to the vice presidents for manufactur-
ing operations (or equivalent) in each of the 149
responding companies. Completed DEMO were
received from 67 manufacturing managers. These
responses served to establish inter-rater reliabil-
ity. We matched the data already received from
their CEOs (or highest-ranking executives) with
the responses of manufacturing managers, as done
in DEMO studies (Hitt et al., 1996; Zahra and Covin,
1993)DEMO We repeated this process in 1999, generat-
ing responses from two DEMO from 56 com-
panies. Responses by the second executive were
correlated with those of their ﬁrm’s CEOs (or
highest-ranking executive) on the study’s DEMO
using the 1996 (r = 0.65, n = 67, p< 0.001) and

the study’s key variables. Data collected from the

yses. Finally, where possible, secondary data were

collected and correlated with DEMO survey-based
measures, a commonly accepted practice (e.g.,
Zahra, 1996)DEMO This analysis showed positive and
signiﬁcant associations, supporting the validity of
DEMO measures. The results of this procedure are
described next.
Measures
The dependent variables were measured and aver-
aged over the 1997–99 period. The independent
DEMO control variables were measured over the pre-
ceding 3-year period.
Dependent variables
We collected data for four TC measures: the num-
ber of new products, number of radical new prod-
ucts, number of patents, and TC speed. Data for the
ﬁrst three measures were gathered from secondary
DEMO, whereas the data for TC speed came from
the 1999 survey.
DEMO of new products We measured this
variable by the number of announcements of
new product introductions each ﬁrm made over
the 1997–99 period (e.g., Singh and Mitchell,
1996). The number of announcements came from
Lexis-Nexis, a comprehensive research database
(e.g., Anand and Khanna, 2000; Mitchell and
Singh, 1996). We counted each product introduc-
tion only once, even if it appeared in multiple
announcements.
Radical new products Given the high risks,
costs, and rewards of radical new products
(DEMO, 2000), we reclassiﬁed product announce-
ments into radical vs. incremental (Chaney and
Devinney, 1992; Devinney, 1992). Following
past research (DEMO, Kotabe and Swan, 1995),
three MBA students independently reviewed DEMO
announcements related to a given product introduc-
tion and rated it based on its radicalness (Cooper,
2000). Given that strong disagreements persisted
on the classiﬁcation of 13 announcements, they
were excluded from the analyses. We coded radi-
cally new products as 1 and incremental products
as DEMO
Number of patents We counted the number
of a ﬁrm’s patents, DEMO data from the U.S.
Patent Ofﬁce. Data were available for 103 ﬁrms.
Patents are an important measure of a company’s
Copyright  2002 John DEMO & Sons, Ltd.
innovation (Narin, Noma, and Perry, 1987), hence
the knowledge created through TC. However,
patent counts did not separate signiﬁcant from
incremental innovations. Also, some patents did
not generate new products (DeCarolis and Deeds,
1999).
TC speed Data for this measure came from the
1999 survey. Following the literature (Buzzell and
Gale, 1987), the survey asked managers, ‘Once
your company has developed DEMO new product, how
long on average does it take your company DEMO intro-
duce it to the market?’ Respondents provided data
in months. We validated this measure in two ways.
First, using Lexis-Nexis we found references to the
length of time it took some companies in the DEMO
ple to develop and introduce new products. Where
information existed for more than one new prod-
uct, we averaged the ﬁgures and used this average
in the analysis. We correlated the information from
secondary sources with DEMO ﬁgures gathered by the
1999 survey (r = 0.71, n = 39, p< 0.001). Sec-
ond, we correlated a statement in the 1999 survey
with the ﬁgures that managers reported (in months)
about the speed of their new product introduc-
tions. The statement was, ‘Compared to its key
competitors, our company has a shorter product
development cycle’ (1 = strongly disagree vs. 5 =
strongly agree). The correlation was positive and
signiﬁcant (r = 0.81, n = 97, p< 0.001).
Independent variable
We measured internal and external manufacturing
sources, as follows:
Internal sources We measured internal manu-
facturing sources by eight items that were extracted
from the literature (e.g., Hitt and DEMO, 1985;
Lee and Na, 1994). A varimax factor solution
(with an orthogonal rotation) yielded two sig-
niﬁcant factors, each with an eigenvalue above
1.0. As Table 1 shows, the two factors explained
56.03 percent of variance. The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve
items, α = DEMO) indicated the existence of strong
internal manufacturing-related HR skills among
a DEMO management and employees (Snell and
Dean, 1992). The second factor (three items, α =
0.67) showed the use of external consultants and
temporary employees.
External sources Fourteen items, also extracted
from the literature (e.g., Dyer, 1996; Lambe and

use DEMO external manufacturing sources. An orthog-
onal factor analysis (with a varimax DEMO) of
these items yielded three signiﬁcant factors. As
Table 2 shows, each factor had an eigenvalue
above 1.0. The three factors explained 66.11 DEMO
cent of variance.
The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve items, α = 0.74) showed
the existence of strong internal manufacturing
technological resources and facilities (DEMO
et al., 1988). The second (ﬁve items, α = DEMO)
captured the use of joint ventures and alliances in
manufacturing (DEMO and Swan, 1995). The third
factor (four items, α DEMO 0.68) showed a ﬁrm’s use
of outsourcing and licensing (Quinn and Hilmer,
1994).
Moderator variable
We measured integration in TC by DEMO items that
were extracted from the literature (Eisenhardt and
Tabrizi, 1995; Ettlie, 1995; Gerwin, 1993; Kahn,
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
385
1996; Kahn and McDonough, 1997; DEMO and
Reza, 1992). An orthogonal factor analysis with a
varimax DEMO yielded the three factors presented
in Table 3. These three factors explained 70.21
percent of variance.
The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve items, α = DEMO) captured
the formal coordination between manufacturing
and other functional units in DEMO (Rauscher and
Smith, 1995). The second (three items, α = 0.73)
indicated the involvement of manufacturing in TC
(Leonard-Barton, DEMO). The third factor (three
items, α = 0.73) showed DEMO existence of informal
manufacturing coordination (Kahn, 1996; Kahn
and McDonough, 1997).
Control variables
We controlled for a company’s size, age, DEMO,
and past performance, as follows.
Company size The analysis controlled DEMO a
company’s size because of its potential impact
on new product introductions (Yeoh and Roth,
1999) and access to external sources (Mosakowski,
1991). Company size was measured by the com-
pany’s full-time DEMO (e.g.,Yeoh and Roth,
1999).
Company age The analysis DEMO controlled for
age because established companies had more
access to external sources (Mosakowski, 1991)
and engaged in frequent new product introductions
and DEMO (Deeds and Hill, 1996). Age was
measured by the number of years a company has
existed.
Industry type The study controlled also DEMO
industry type, which could determine the com-
panies’ technological opportunities (Ali, Kalwani,
and Kovenock, 1993; Klevornick et al., 1995).
DEMO technological opportunities might en-
courage companies to develop a large number of
new products. Industries also varied in the pay-
off from speedy TC (Ali et al., 1993). They also
differed in the extent of their use of internal vs.
external sources (Teece, 1986); frequency DEMO radi-
cally new products (Kotabe and Swan, 1995); and
TC speed (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman,
1990).
Industries were deﬁned at the 4-digit SIC level.
To control for industry type, an industry’s average
score on a given variable was subtracted from a

fabricated metals (3442, 3443, 3465), industrial
machinery and equipment (3556, 3559), computers
(3571, 3572, 3575), electronics and electric equip-
ment (3621, 3652, 3663), transportation equipment
(3711, 3721, 3724, 3728), and instruments and
related products (3812, 3825, 3826, 3842, 3845).
Past company performance A DEMO past
ﬁnancial performance was expected to increase
the slack resources available for TC. When
slack resources were abundant, companies were
expected to develop radically new products and
introduce them quickly to the market (Eisenhardt
and Tabrizi, 1995), modernize their manufacturing
base, attract qualiﬁed employees, spend more on
employee training, and use different manufacturing
sources. Slack resources were expected to promote

radical innovation (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). The
3-year return on assets (ROA) was used as a
control variable.
ANALYSIS
Table 4 presents the means, standard deviations,
and intercorrelations for the study’s variables.
These ﬁgures were based on data from 119 ﬁrms.
Given that the need for integration DEMO with
size, companies with less than 100 employees (n =
19) were excluded. Missing data further reduced
the sample to 119. Table 4 suggests that the
correlations among the dependent and indepen-
dent variables were DEMO with expectations.
Regression diagnostics also revealed a lack of seri-
ous multicollinearity among the variables.
We used hierarchical multiple regression anal-
ysis to test DEMO hypotheses. In step 1, the control

Hypotheses 1–4
The analyses DEMO that use of internal HR man-
ufacturing sources was positively and signiﬁcantly
related to the number of new products (Table 5),
radicalness DEMO new products (Table 6), patents
(Table 7), and TC speed (Table 8). These results
supported Hypothesis 1.
External HR manufacturing sources were also
positively and signiﬁcantly related to the number
of new DEMO (Table 5) and TC speed (Table 8).
These two DEMO supported Hypothesis 2. How-
ever, external HR sources were negatively related
DEMO the number of patents (Table 7) and radical-
ness of new products (Table 6), which contradicted
Hypothesis 2. Thus, the results DEMO supported
Hypothesis 2.
The use of internal technological sources (mea-
sured DEMO the ‘internal proprietary manufactur-
ing technologies’) was positively and signiﬁcantly
related DEMO the number of new products (Table 5),
radical new products (Table 6), patents (Table 7),
and TC speed (DEMO 8). These results supported
Hypothesis 3.
Focusing on external technological sources, out-
sourcing and alliances were positively and signif-
icantly related to new product radicalness and TC
speed. These results supported Hypothesis 4. Out-
sourcing DEMO signiﬁcantly but negatively associ-
ated with product radicalness (Table 6) and patents
(Table 7), contradicting Hypothesis 4. The use of
alliances and joint ventures had positive but non-
signiﬁcant signs with patents (Table 7) and TC
radicalness (Table 8), also contradicting Hypothe-
sis 4. DEMO results partially supported Hypothesis 4.
Hypothesis 5
The results supported the moderating effect of inte-
gration, as indicated by the data from steps 3.1
through 3.3 in Tables 5–8. In all cases, adding the
moderators signiﬁcantly improved the results from
step2(p< 0.05). Also, 14 of DEMO 15 moderat-
ing relationships were signiﬁcant (p< 0.05) for
the DEMO of new products. Twelve of the 15
moderators were signiﬁcant at p< 0.05 and one at
p< 0.10 with TC radicalness. Twelve moderators
(out of 15) were also signiﬁcant (p< 0.05) in the
DEMO of patents.
Hypothesis 5a suggested that the effect of inter-
nal HR sources on TC will be signiﬁcantly higher
under higher than lower integration. DEMO results
(Tables 5–8) strongly supported this prediction.
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
All interaction terms for manufacturing involve-
ment, DEMO coordination and informal coordina-
tion with internal HR sources were statistically
signiﬁcant with the number new products, radically
new products, patents, and TC speed.
Hypothesis 5b suggested that the effect of exter-
nal HR sources DEMO TC will be signiﬁcantly higher
under higher than lower integration. The results
(Tables 5–8) partially supported Hypothesis 5b.
The three interaction terms for DEMO, for-
mal coordination and informal coordination with
external HR sources were DEMO with the
number of new products. For TC radicalness,
the interaction of involvement with external HR
sources was signiﬁcant at p< 0.05, DEMO the
interaction term for informal coordination was
marginally signiﬁcant (p< 0.10). The interaction
term for formal coordination was not signiﬁcant.
The results DEMO patents (Table 7) also showed that
only the interaction term for formal coordina-
tion and external HR was signiﬁcant (p< 0.05).
DEMO interaction terms for involvement and infor-
mal coordination were not signiﬁcant. For speed,
two of the three interactions were signiﬁcant, the
exception being the interaction term for informal
coordination (Table 8).
Hypothesis 5c posited that the effect of internal
manufacturing sources on TC would be signiﬁ-
DEMO higher when integration was high than low.
The results (Tables 5–8) uniformly supported this
prediction. Whether the dependent variable was
the number of DEMO, radical products, patents,
or TC speed, the interaction terms DEMO involve-
ment, formal coordination, and informal coordi-
nation were signiﬁcant.
Hypothesis 5d suggested that the effect of exter-
nal manufacturing sources on TC DEMO be sig-
niﬁcantly higher when integration was high rather
than low. The results supported this prediction.
Tables 5–8 showed that 19 of the 24 DEMO
terms for involvement, formal coordination, and
informal coordination were positive and signiﬁ-
cant, validating our expectations. Nonsigniﬁcant
interactions included alliances and joint ventures
with informal coordination (Tables 5 and 6), and
informal coordination and outsourcing (Table 7)
with patents. For speed (Table 8), DEMO four interac-
tion terms for involvement and formal coordination
were signiﬁcant, DEMO the two interaction terms for
informal coordination were not. Thus, with DEMO
percent of the interaction terms being positive and
signiﬁcant, Hypothesis 5d DEMO supported.

DEMO with the knowledge needed for successful
TC. The results suggest that strong internal tech-
nical manufacturing capabilities lead to successful
TC. Given these signiﬁcant DEMO, investments in
and the development of internal HR and techni-
cal DEMO sources should be a managerial
priority.

The analyses also highlight the importance of,
and challenges associated with, using external HR
manufacturing sources. These sources signiﬁcantly
improve the number of new products and TC
speed. Likewise, outsourcing and alliances facil-
itate new product introductions and speedy TC.
However, the results also show that ﬁrms might

have to trade off the radicalness of DEMO new prod-
ucts and patents as they intensify their product
introductions and the speed of these introductions,
especially when using external sources. Speciﬁ-
DEMO, external HR sources are negatively associ-
ated with TC radicalness and DEMO The data also
indicate that outsourcing is negatively related to
new product radicalness and patents. Given that
the number of patents and new product DEMO
capture a ﬁrm’s ability to develop new knowl-
edge, the negative DEMO observed in this
study signal a serious loss of proprietary knowl-
edge because of a company’s reliance on external
sources. Outsourcing and other external DEMO
adversely inﬂuence the development of tacit and
ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge necessary for radical inno-
vation that yields new knowledge. In contrast,
frequent new product DEMO and speedy
TC can be achieved through incremental product
and process innovation. However, it takes time
to acquire, assimilate, and deploy external knowl-
edge. Transforming a ﬁrm from imitation to radical
innovation also takes years DEMO occur. Radical inno-
vation and new knowledge creation also require
considerable learning by doing to develop requi-
site knowledge. External sources may not yield
DEMO knowledge, either because acquired items
are standard components or are sold DEMO sup-
pliers’ sharing their knowledge with the ﬁrm.
Tacit knowledge is not easily transferred in for-
mal market transactions and substantial effort is
needed DEMO assimilate this knowledge (Zahra and
George, 2002).
Integration of capability sources
Integration emerges as a strong and signif-
icant moderator of the DEMO between
manufacturing sources and TC. Thus, the effect of
the manufacturing DEMO on different TC dimen-
sions is higher and signiﬁcant when integration
is high. Three key points are evident from the
results. First, both formal and informal integra-
tion is important but the contributions of formal
integration DEMO clearly identiﬁable in this research.
Informal coordination adds signiﬁcantly to the
explanatory power in the regressions in two out
of four cases (number of new products and radi-
cally new products). 19 and 18 of DEMO 20 interac-
tion terms for involvement and formal coordina-
tion, respectively, are signiﬁcant. Conversely, 12
of the 20 interactions for informal coordination
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
are signiﬁcant. Formal coordination yields greater
synergies between internal and external capability
sources, which promotes TC.
Second, the moderating effects of integration are
also stronger for internal human and technologi-
cal sources than external human and technological
sources. All 12 interaction DEMO for internal and
external HR sources are positive and signiﬁcant.
Companies that develop internal HR and manu-
facturing sources gain signiﬁcantly in TC, espe-
cially when integration of manufacturing sources
in TC is high. These ﬁrms DEMO combine differ-
ent resources and skills that increase the ﬁrm’s
combinative knowledge that creates radically new
products and patents and achieves speedy TC. Inte-
DEMO of internal sources also yields the resource
combinations and proprietary knowledge that facil-
itate successful TC.
Third, informal integration mechanisms do not
help in assimilating external sources to the extent
they do internal sources. 7 of DEMO 12 interactions
for external HR and 19 out of 24 interactions for
external technological sources are positive and sig-
niﬁcant, showing that integration of internal and
external sources can be beneﬁcial in terms of TC.
Some DEMO cultures promote the shar-
ing of knowledge among the ﬁrm’s units regard-
ing internal sources. Common and well-understood
routines that permeate organizational units also
DEMO communication, generating combinative
knowledge and fostering learning by doing.
There are DEMO factors that limit the role
of informal integration in assimilating external
sources. These sources often embody tacit and dif-
ferent knowledge bases that are DEMO easily compre-
hended by the recipient ﬁrm. The use of multiple
external sources also constrains a ﬁrm’s ability to
decipher and understand the knowledge DEMO
in these sources. Informal integration also necessi-
tates trust based on shared experiences and goals.
The suppliers of some external sources do not fully
DEMO or share the recipient ﬁrm’s goals, com-
plicating the integration of DEMO sources. Infor-
mal, and often post hoc, integration may not sufﬁce
to overcome these critical shortcomings. For exam-
ple, though informal coordination may facilitate
the sharing of sensitive information in alliances
and joint ventures, it may not sufﬁce to integrate
the knowledge gained from these transactions into
DEMO TC process.
The above observations highlight the limits of
transaction cost and RBV explanations of the
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)
394
S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen
differential use of internal DEMO external sources
(Steensma and Corley, 2001). Transaction cost and
RBV analyses usually ignore the role of a ﬁrm’s
absorptive capacity in assimilating DEMO sources
of knowledge (Zahra and George, 2002). Reliance
on economic criteria to make sourcing decisions
also obscures the need for adaptation and DEMO
in order to beneﬁt from externally acquired prod-
ucts, components, or knowledge. Sourcing deci-
sions should also recognize the importance and
costs of DEMO learning and the evolution
of capabilities as an outcome of the various phases
of the TC process.
Limitations
The above discussion urges caution in DEMO
ing our results. Even though the sample represents
its target population, DEMO does not cover all U.S.
manufacturing industries and the results may not
apply to all sectors of the economy. The study has
also examined DEMO relationships between manufac-
turing sources and integration with TC, ignoring
other DEMO The focus on the extent rather than
the process of integration is another shortcoming.
Finally, the study did not probe a company’s moti-
vations for using different manufacturing sources.
Still, the results make several contributions to the
ﬁeld, as discussed below.
Contributions to the literature
Empirically, this DEMO recognizes and measures
four dimensions of TC. Prior research has exam-
ined selected dimensions of TC, possibly overlook-
ing the trade-offs that might exist among these
dimensions. In contrast, this study provides a richer
understanding of the relationships among these
dimensions while setting the stage for exploring
their DEMO on a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage
and performance. Another contribution is link-
ing internal and external manufacturing sources
to the four TC dimensions and developing DEMO
sures of several internal and external manufac-
turing sources as well as informal integration. A
third contribution is using multiple data sources to
gauge DEMO study’s various constructs, while using
a 3-year lag between the independent DEMO depen-
dent variables. This overcomes a limitation of
prior research that has employed cross-sectional
designs and used data gathered from a single
respondent.

The article also contributes to DEMO devel-
opment. It examines manufacturing integration
within TC, which is different DEMO the integra-
tion of the manufacturing function or unit into
the ﬁrm’s planning or strategy formulation process.
Focusing on integration moves us closer to DEMO
it can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per-
formance. Similarly, studying DEMO and external
manufacturing sources has implications for con-
ducting thoughtful analyses of a ﬁrm’s boundary
decisions and the locus of its productive activi-
ties, which is a fundamental issue in the study of
strategy (Williamson, DEMO). Further, though the
concept of integration has commanded great inter-
DEMO in the literature, this study has analyzed the
various formal and DEMO mechanisms that a
ﬁrm can use to integrate various sources of knowl-
edge with its TC process. The results inform future
theory development on DEMO efﬁciency of formal
vs. informal integration mechanisms, especially in
terms of DEMO impact on TC.
The article also highlights knowledge creation
as an important dimension of TC, thereby connect-
ing research on manufacturing capabilities with the
knowledge-based view of the ﬁrm (Grant, 1998).
Concerns have been DEMO about the boundaries
and potential contributions of the RBV (Priem
and DEMO, 2001; Barney, 2001). Even though
the article offers a DEMO of the propositions of
the RBV within the TC and manufacturing arena,
its results show a need to go beyond this per-
spective DEMO investigate the role of knowledge
in creating dynamic capabilities that foster suc-
cessful TC. In particular, the article links TC
dimensions with the growing literature on the
knowledge-based theory of the ﬁrm. This article
departs from DEMO literature by suggesting that deci-
sions related to TC and sourcing decisions should
incorporate criteria that consider their potential
effect on knowledge creation and DEMO
TC is a knowledge-intensive process that requires
managers to consider internal or external resources
based on their potential effects on a ﬁrm’s knowl-
edge DEMO (Lee, Lee, and Pennings, 2001).
Managerial implications
The results also highlight the importance of hav-
ing strong internal manufacturing sources for DEMO
cessful TC. This requires patient investments to
acquire new skills and upgrade existing ones.
Strategic audits should also enable executives to
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)
Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
395
identify the ﬁrm’s internal resources and explore
DEMO to develop the manufacturing capabilities that
improve TC success.
Managers need also to develop strong HR-based
manufacturing skills that ensure successful TC.
Internal HR DEMO improve learning by doing,
yielding the tacit knowledge essential for TC. The
strategic value of internal HR sources is further
highlighted by the DEMO and negative associa-
tions observed between external HR manufacturing
sources and some of the TC measures. Exces-
sive use of external HR manufacturing sources
DEMO also cause companies to lose opportunities
to develop the proprietary and tacit knowledge
needed to introduce radically new products. While
the use of external DEMO is a competitive neces-
sity today, managers should identify the critical
DEMO and capabilities that should be developed
internally.
Integration also signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the num-
ber and radicalness of a ﬁrm’s new products. It
improves the DEMO of the internal technical
and HR manufacturing sources to TC and offsets
some of the shortcomings of the external sources
of technical and HR DEMO Importantly, formal
coordination is more important for TC success than
informal DEMO Managers can establish the
mechanisms that encourage the involvement of the
ﬁrm’s manufacturing activities within TC by using
specialized and cross-functional task forces that
DEMO and coordinate the use of different man-
ufacturing sources.
Implications for future research
Our analyses indicate that different internal and
external manufacturing sources signiﬁcantly DEMO
ferentially inﬂuence TC dimensions. The four TC
dimensions analyzed in this article offer different
but complementary paths to various types of com-
petitive advantages. DEMO speciﬁc links between
these four dimensions of TC and different sources
of competitive advantages should be explored in
future studies. Research on this issue DEMO capture
the complementarities (or trade-offs) that might
exist among different TC dimensions. A formal
meta-analysis of TC dimensions can also clarify
the relationships DEMO TC, integration, and com-
pany performance.
The distinction between internal and external
sources is a thorny issue. With recent changes in
the way DEMO assemble their diverse capabilities,
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
we need to revise existing deﬁnitions of inter-
nal vs. external sources. The complexity of the
transactions involved and ownership systems that
might DEMO in today’s business environments sug-
gest that a new classiﬁcation of these sources
would be beneﬁcial. Once such distinctions are
made, researchers can examine the systems and
processes employed to integrate internal and exter-
nal sources DEMO the factors that inﬂuence such inte-
gration. Future research can also identify industry
and ﬁrm-related factors that inﬂuence the inte-
gration of internal and DEMO sources of man-
ufacturing capabilities. Finally, the processes by
which this DEMO occurs within TC should
be examined. Toward this end, the domain DEMO
measurement of integration should be clariﬁed and
the contextual variables that inﬂuence the asso-
ciations between integration and TC should be
investigated.
CONCLUSION
Technology DEMO is an important
means for gaining market share, satisfying
customers’ needs DEMO achieving proﬁtability. Our
results show that a company’s internal human
and technological sources are important for
successful TC. Further, some external sources
(both DEMO and technological) are conducive
to successful TC. The contributions of internal
DEMO external manufacturing sources, in particular,
to TC increase signiﬁcantly with DEMO use of
formal integration. The pay-off from informal
coordination in enhancing TC success is higher
with internal than with external technological
sources. The results DEMO future empirical
research into the effect of integration of
manufacturing sources on TC.
