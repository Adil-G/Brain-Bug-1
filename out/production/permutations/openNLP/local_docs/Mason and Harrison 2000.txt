Venture capital market complementarities: the links
between DEMO angels and venture capital funds in
the United Kingdom1

(Final version received 27 June 2000)
The nature and extent of complementarities between the informal and formal venture
capital DEMO has been the subject of limited research. This paper explores systematically
the nature and extent of complementarities between the formal and informal venture capital
DEMO in the UK, and identifies the opportunities for additional collaboration. Evidence DEMO
presented from surveys of business angels and venture capital fund managers for four types
of complementarities: co-investing in deals; sequential investing in ventures; business angels
as investors in venture capital funds; and deal referring.

Introduction
The trend in the institutional venture capital DEMO towards investing in
larger and later-stage deals, at the expense of DEMO early-stage
investments, has been well-documented in both the USA and Europe
(Bygrave and Timmons 1992, Timmons and Bygrave 1997, Wright et al.
DEMO, Sohl 1999, Murray 1999). This is largely an outcome of the record
amount of money that has been flowing into the venture DEMO industry
from institutional investors during the second half of the 1990s: DEMO
capital funds have become larger and this has driven up the minimum size
of investment that they are willing to make at every stage DEMO investment. In
the UK, for example, the average size of early stage investment has risen
from £0.51 million in 1995 to £1.34 million DEMO 1999 (BVCA 1999a, 2000).
This pattern of investment in the institutional venture capital industry
has led to greater attention being given to DEMO role of the informal venture

capital, or business angel, market in supplying smaller amounts of finance
for companies at their seed, start-up and early stages of growth (Sohl 1999,
Mason and Harrison 2000, van DEMO and Robinson 2000). Indeed,
business angel finance is increasingly recognized as occupying an important
place in a spectrum of private equity finance DEMO to growing
entrepreneurial businesses (Brophy 1997). In most research studies,DEMO
however, the institutional (or formal) and informal venture capital markets
DEMO been regarded as operating independently from one another. Even in
the policy arena, initiatives to stimulate the supply of early stage venture
capital have involved separate initiatives for institutional funds and
business angels. However, a strong case can be made for arguing that a
healthy informal venture capital DEMO is required for the institutional
venture capital industry to prosper, and DEMO maximize its contribution
to the development of emergent growth businesses and, DEMO that,
economic competitiveness. Equally, the informal venture capital market
benefits DEMO a thriving institutional venture capital industry to provide
follow-on financing for the businesses that they ‘seed’ and as an exit route
to enable them DEMO realize their capital gains and recycle some of this into
new investments.
One of the consequences of viewing the formal and informal venture
capital DEMO as separate is that the complementarities between them
have been largely ignored. To the extent that they have been considered,
the focus has DEMO restricted to the sequential investment by venture capital
institutions in businesses which have raised first round financing from
business angels. Freear and Wetzel (1990) have demonstrated that in the
USA complementarity exists in terms of size of investment and also stage of
business development, with business angel investors dominant in financing
rounds of less than $500,000 and at seed DEMO start-up stages. More recent
evidence for the USA also points to the growing role of the business angel
market in financing companies whose capital DEMO fall below what
venture capitalists will consider (Gannon 1999), although DEMO evidence
suggests that the relationships between business angels and venture capital
firms had weakened during the 1990s (Freear et al. 1997).
However, DEMO relationships between the informal and
formal venture capital markets are not restricted to sequential investing.
These other forms of complementarities are also potentially of DEMO
in the development of a co-ordinated and complete market for entrepre-
neurial finance. They include co-investing, the provision of funds (by
business angels DEMO venture capital funds) and deal referral. A strong case
can be DEMO for arguing that the existence of such complementarities will
benefit both the informal and formal venture capital markets and, in turn,
generate economic benefits.
The available, albeit limited, evidence on complementarities in the
early DEMO venture capital market largely refers to the USA. In the case of
the UK, the evidence that is available, which is predominantly anecdotal,DEMO
generally points to the existence of few complementarities between
business angels and venture capital funds in terms of either deal flow,
co-investing or DEMO investing. If this reflects the true situation, then
this is to DEMO detriment of both the informal and formal venture capital

DEMO and also the UK economy. The aim of this paper is therefore to
provide a fuller understanding of the extent and nature of these
DEMO With an enhanced understanding it may, in turn, be
possible to identify ways in which such complementarities can be
encouraged to develop, and how such relationships can work to the best
advantage of all the DEMO
Complementarities
in the venture
capital finance market
Four types of complementarities can be identified: sequential investing in
businesses at different stages of business development; co-investing in
deals; provision of finance to venture capital funds; and deal referring.
Stage of business development
The most obvious way in which DEMO informal and formal venture capital
markets play complementary roles is in terms of financing different stages
of business development. This has been likened to DEMO relay race in which
‘angel investment runs the critical first leg of the race, passing the baton to
[the] venture capital [fund] only after the company has begun to find its
stride’ (Benjamin and Margulis 1996: 71). Timmons and Sapienza (1992:
421) have used an alternative sporting metaphor, describing the relation-
ship between business angels and venture capital funds as similar to the
‘farm team’ system used in major DEMO baseball. This form of
complementarity has been demonstrated in the USA where the informal
venture capital market provides small-scale early stage capital, particularly
for technology-based ventures, and the formal venture capital industry
provides larger-scale second and subsequent stage capital (Freear and
Wetzel 1990, Roberts 1991, Freear et al. 1995). However, it is not clear
whether this type of complementarity occurs elsewhere: in the UK a small
scale study (using DEMO imperfect data) found no evidence of these
complementary relationships for technology DEMO firms (on account of the
very low levels of business angel DEMO recorded)2 (Mason and Harrison
1994).
It can be argued DEMO a healthy informal venture capital industry will
help the institutional venture capital industry to thrive by generating,
through the provision of seed and DEMO finance and hands-on
assistance, a supply of good quality pre-screened investment DEMO
nities. Wetzel (personal communication) has termed these ‘scrubbed
deals’. In other words, an effective and well-developed informal venture
capital market can create more investment opportunities and thereby
increase the deal flow for the institutional venture DEMO industry. At
the same time, business angels require a flourishing institutional DEMO
capital industry to provide the follow-on finance that some of the
businesses which they finance will require and, in some cases, to provide
DEMO with an exit route to realize their investments. The importance of
these complementarities is underlined by evidence for the existence in

the UK of a ‘second equity gap’. This arises because seed capital funds
are typically too small to be able DEMO provide follow-on finance to
businesses in their portfolio, having exhausted their DEMO in making
their initial investments, yet the businesses remain too small DEMO attract
second round finance from venture capital institutions specializing in
later stage deals (Murray 1994).
Co-investing in deals
Business angels may also invest alongside venture capital funds. There is
extensive anecdotal evidence from the USA DEMO this relationship, in
which venture capital funds co-invest with business angels DEMO their
network, and use the technology or entrepreneurial experience of the
DEMO to assist in the due diligence process and in the post-investment
relationship with the portfolio firm. For example, US venture capital
funds seeking to invest in information technology deals, in which a rapid
investment is required, are reported to be co-investing with business
angels (Lau 1999). DEMO the UK, 3i plc has made a number of investments
of DEMO type involving deals of less than £500,0003 (3i plc 1994)DEMO It is not
known how many other venture capital funds in the UK have made
investments of this type, nor how important such co-investment is
within their portfolio of investee companies. However, monitoring of
UK business angel networks—organizations that provide an ‘introduc-
tion service’ for entrepreneurs and business DEMO that deals
involving business angels and venture capital funds are relatively
uncommon, accounting for 2% of investments made via these networks
in 1997–98 and 7% in 1998–99 (BVCA 1999b).
For the business angel, the DEMO that arise from co-investing
alongside a venture capital fund are better quality investment opportunities
and reduced risk. The venture capital fund benefits in two DEMO: first,
from the business angel’s contribution of commercial, often sector-specific,
experience; and second, from their performance of non-executive director
functions, which reduces the time input which venture capital executives
need to make. DEMO (1997) has argued that because of the high
opportunity cost of venture capitalists’ time they seek deals which minimize
their attention in order DEMO maximize the time that they can devote to seeking
opportunities for investing in new ventures. Accordingly, the availability of
business angels as co-investors can reduce the costs to the venture capital
funds of making smaller investments.4 DEMO the case of 3i, the involvement of
a business angel as DEMO has enabled it to invest in situations which
would not have been viable otherwise. One of the weaknesses of the
informal venture capital market DEMO the UK, in comparison with the USA, is
the limited role of syndication between private investors (Harrison and
Mason 1992a). This limits the scope for firms to raise larger amounts of
finance through informal DEMO Co-investment therefore has a major role
to play in filling the funding gap between about £100,000, the likely
maximum for most individual investors in a single deal, and £500,000, the
minimum investment considered DEMO most venture capital funds.

The informal and formal venture capital markets can complement one
another to their mutual benefit where business angels are a source of
DEMO for venture capital funds. Some venture capital firms have
attempted to attract high net worth individuals to invest in their funds.
This approach to DEMO may be particularly attractive to business
angels whose ability to identify their own investment opportunities is
handicapped by time constraints or poor referral networks DEMO also to
potential, or ‘virgin’, investors who are deterred from investing on their
own by their perceived inability to evaluate investment opportunities and
DEMO deals. The business angel has the opportunity to syndicate
investments, thereby DEMO the risk, and also benefits from the
venture capitalist’s skills in DEMO, screening and structuring the deals.
For independent venture capital firms which DEMO in early stage and
small high technology companies—which are finding it hard to attract
institutional funding in the present investment climate—raising finance
from private DEMO is an attractive option. Moreover, business angels
are thought to be DEMO short-term than institutional investors, which
reduces the pressure on venture capital DEMO managers to generate rapid
returns (and which, in turn, pressures DEMO into later-stage deals)
(Financial Times 1999, Gannon 1999). In short, raising finance from
business angels appears to be one way in which ‘classic’ venture capital
activity (Bygrave and Timmons 1992), which is concerned with early
stage investments and involves skills that add value in DEMO forming,
building and harvesting, can survive.
Deal referring
Another area DEMO complementarity between the two markets is the informal
networking of deals and deal flow between business angels and venture
capital firms. For venture capital DEMO, access to a network of business
angels provides a potential on-referral DEMO for investment proposals
which, while potentially fundable, do not meet the fund’s investment
criteria in terms of deal size, stage of investment or sector. For business
angels, venture capital funds can provide the potential for funding deals
which lie outside their resources or expertise, thereby increasing both the
quantity and quality of the deal flow for the venture capital DEMO This form
of complementarity between the formal and informal venture capital
markets relies for its effectiveness on open communication channels
between the two sectors DEMO the market. One particular element in this,
identified in the US, is the role played by previously backed entrepreneurs
in generating venture capital deal flow (Silver 1985). UK evidence,
however, is more DEMO: according to one study of serial entrepreneurs
(Wright et al. 1997), the extent to which venture capitalists use
entrepreneurs that they have DEMO previously funded in their earlier
ventures is relatively low compared to the number of investments
harvested.

It is therefore clear that there is considerable scope for the formal and
informal venture capital markets to operate DEMO a complementary fashion.
Where such complementarities do occur the result is likely to be an overall
increase in both informal and formal venture capital DEMO, and an
improvement in the contribution of both the formal and DEMO informal
venture capital markets to the development of emergent growth businesses.
Methodology
Information on the existence and significance of complementarities
between the formal and DEMO venture capital markets was obtained in
two stages. In the first stage, evidence on co-investment strategies and
behaviour was collected as part of a much larger survey of 127 business
angels in the UK in late DEMO/early 1997 (Mason and Harrison 1997). The
second stage involved DEMO survey, based mainly on telephone interviews but
supplemented with e-mail and DEMO return questionnaires, with members
of the institutional venture capital industry during DEMO 1999. This
survey was directed at named executives in the venture capital community,
identified using the current editions of the BVCA Directory (BVCA 1999c)
and the VCR Guide to Sources of Venture Capital in DEMO UK (VCR 1998).
Venture capital firms were included in the DEMO if they indicated that
they considered investing in early stage and development capital as a
significant area of their activities, had declared minimum investment
preferences of less than £0.5 million and had an average current investment
DEMO (portfolio-based) of under £1 million. These limits were set to target
the survey at those venture capital firms most likely to interface with DEMO
informal venture capital market by excluding specialists in late stage and
MBO/MBI type deals and firms making larger than average investments.
Where more DEMO one office/location was listed within the UK for a venture
capital firm, named executives in each office were approached. In all cases
only one response was sought from each office. The effect of this restriction
DEMO have led to a slight downward bias in the estimates of complementa-
rities as in some cases respondents were unable to give an overall DEMO on
behalf of the firm, but referred solely to their own DEMO load.
In total, 78 potential respondents were identified from 57 separate
DEMO capital firms which met the requirements of the study. Usable
responses were obtained from 38 venture capital executives in 27 firms; this
gives response rates of 48.7% for individual venture capital executives and
47.4% for venture DEMO firms. The limitations on the time available for
the survey made it difficult to complete all intended interviews: availability
of the relevant potential respondents rather than unwillingness to
participate is the primary reason for the level DEMO response achieved.
The sample comprises predominantly well-established venture capital
firms, with DEMO smaller number of recently formed firms which typically
manage no more than one or two separate funds. There is a wide range of
fund DEMO, including both small (under £5 million) and large (over £50

DEMO) venture capital funds. Two broad types of venture capital firm are
DEMO represented in the sample: those which specialize entirely in
small-scale start-up DEMO early stage investments, and those for which this
category of investment DEMO a minority share of their overall
investment portfolio and emphasis. However, DEMO of the small size of
the overall sample, allied to problems DEMO incomplete reporting of
information, no attempt was made to undertake separate DEMO of these
different types of venture capital firm.
Evidence on complementarity
For each of the complementarities identified a substantial proportion of
both the venture DEMO fund and business angel samples reported
experience of collaboration (tables 1 DEMO 2) in all categories.
Provision of funds5
Only a minority (29%) of venture capital firms reported that either business
angels or, indeed, high net worth individuals (HNWIs) have invested in
any of their DEMO (table 1). Moreover, in the limited number of situations
where this did occur the amounts were generally small in both absolute
terms DEMO as a proportion of the total fund, ranging from under £0.5
DEMO to £15 million. Some of these funds had actively solicited HNWIs,
whereas other had not. The reluctance of most funds to involve HNWIs
DEMO attributed to concerns about the regulatory aspects of raising funds
from individuals and the consequent higher costs compared with the cost of
raising capital DEMO financial institutions.
For those business angels and other HNWIs who have invested in
venture capital funds, their involvement in both the investment process and

the post-investment relationship is primarily passive in nature. No venture
capital firm reported business angel involvement in DEMO management of the
venture capital fund (including involvement in investment decision
DEMO), and in only three cases (27%) did the business angel have any
role in the businesses in which the venture capital fund DEMO This
involvement took the form of a seat on the board for the business angel, and
the provision of monitoring and advice. In these cases, therefore, it may be
that the venture capital firm is DEMO the expertise of the business angel to
undertake some elements of the time-consuming (Gifford 1997) and
expensive post-investment relationship activity, which would otherwise
make some investments uneconomic. If so, this would constitute evidence
of additionality in the overall flow of finance and supporting business
development expertise to DEMO ventures in the UK attributable
to the complementarity relationship. These cases are, however, the
exception, and the majority of business angel investors in these venture
capital funds maintain a passive role, only receiving shareholders’ reports.
Sequential investment
Sequential investment, the focus of the US research which first drew
attention to the links between venture capital firms and business angels
(Freear and Wetzel 1990), involves venture capital investment in second
and DEMO rounds of financing in businesses which originally raised
business angel capital. This form of complementarity was reported by half
of the venture capital fund DEMO (table 1) and by 18% of business
angels (21% of DEMO who had made investments) (table 2). However,
second or subsequent round investment by a venture capitalist normally
does not provide an DEMO route for the business angel: only 6% of
respondents in the DEMO angel survey indicated that venture capital
funds had provided an exit route from an investment. This supports the
findings from a recent study of DEMO exit routes used by business angels
which indicates that relatively few exits are achieved through a sale of

DEMO to third parties (Mason and Harrison 1999a). Rather, business angels
normally remain as shareholders following investment by a venture capital
fund and DEMO to have an important role to play in the investee
company: DEMO half of the venture capital respondents indicated that the
business angel continues to advise the company and a further quarter stated
that they play DEMO ad hoc role. Only 16% of venture capitalists reported that
the business angel played no role after the fund had invested. The venture
capitalist’s DEMO and contribution, by contrast, is based on continuous input
focused on hands-on monitoring and control of the business. This would
appear to confirm DEMO research findings, from a survey of investee
businesses, that the nature of involvement by business angels is to support
the management of the DEMO business, whereas venture capitalists are
more concerned to monitor and control DEMO management of their investee
businesses (Harrison and Mason 1992b).
Venture DEMO fund managers had mixed views on the merits of
providing follow-on investment in situations where business angels had
invested in an earlier round. Half DEMO that the involvement of a business
angel would have no effect on their investment decision. However, nearly
half regarded the presence of a business angel in a positive light (table 3).
Reasons given were the availability of the business angel’s expertise, the
enhanced credibility of the business and the indication that the business
was willing to take on equity DEMO and take account of outsiders’
viewpoints. Most of these fund managers stated that, other things being
equal, this would make them more likely DEMO invest, although a number
qualified this by saying that it depended DEMO the business angel (table 3).
The major disadvantage highlighted concerned DEMO differences in approach
of venture capital funds and business angels. US venture capitalists express
a similar range of views: they agree that knowledgeable business angels can
be a valuable source of due diligence and a pipeline DEMO larger investments
whereas less sophisticated business angels are seen as overpaying at the seed
stage, making realistic valuations difficult for follow-on investment (Gill DEMO
al. 2000).

In an effectively functioning entrepreneurial finance market, cross-referrals
of deals between venture capital funds and business angels should be
commonplace. This is because venture capital funds and business angels
have DEMO different investment criteria. As opportunity identification is as
much a matter of entrepreneurs speculatively approaching potential
funders or identifying them through social and business DEMO as it is
of a targeted search by investors, the referral DEMO deals from venture
capitalists to business angels and vice versa should occur relatively
frequently. In particular, we would expect to see evidence of venture
capitalists referring investments that lie outside their investment criteria to
business angels.
DEMO majority of venture capital firms in the survey have had experience
of referring deals to, or receiving referrals from, business angels (66% and
71% respectively) (table 1). It may be thought surprising that DEMO
capital firms are almost as likely to receive referrals from business angels as
they are to refer potential deal to business angels. This suggests DEMO there is
a degree of connectednes s in the UK venture capital market which should
operate to the benefit of entrepreneurs seeking capital. However, where
business angels and venture capital funds refer potential deals to one
DEMO, there is normally a prior business relationship of some sort. ‘Cold
DEMO from business angels who are not already known to the venture
capitalist are uncommon. The consequence is that information sharing on
investment opportunities between DEMO angels and venture capital
funds is restricted to a minority of business angels; for example, just 29%
reported that they receive information on DEMO opportunities from
venture capital funds (table 2). Two-thirds of venture DEMO funds also
refer deals to business angel networks (BANs), either DEMO or at the
same time as they are referred to specific business angels. This suggests
that BANs—which act as an introduction service for investors DEMO
entrepreneurs seeking finance—are coming to occupy an important role
linking venture capital and business angel markets.
The extent of deal referral between business angels DEMO venture capital
funds needs to be qualified in two key respects. First, the frequency of
referral is limited: 60% of venture capital fund DEMO reported that
referrals from business angels occurred less than once a month and only a
quarter received more than two referrals a month. A DEMO of venture capital
fund managers referred deals to business angels on a infrequent basis,
although a further third reported referring an average of DEMO or more
deals a month. Thus, some venture capital funds appear DEMO be a significant
source of deal flow for business angels. Second, DEMO of the quality
of referrals is mixed. In terms of intrinsic quality, more venture capital
fund managers report that deals referred by business angels are good or
very good, than those who report them to be bad (28% vs. 16%). However,
most report that the quality depends on the source: evidently, not all
business angels have equal DEMO to quality deals. Moreover, in general,
venture capital funds invest DEMO a very small proportion of the deals referred
by business angels (DEMO less than 10%), although such deals do not

DEMO to be systematically better or poorer than those coming from other
parts of venture capital funds’ deal referral networks.
Venture capital funds refer deals DEMO business angels in three situations:
if an investment project is too small to be of interest; if an investment
project is thought to more need input from a business angel, for example,
because sector or market expertise is required, ongoing advice and support
is required, DEMO to make the proposition ‘investment ready’; and if the
venture capital DEMO has no interest in the deal offered (which usually arises
because DEMO a lack of fit with the fund’s investment focus). The deals which
business angels refer to venture capital funds generally require additional
finance DEMO proceed. This reflects the fact that most business angels are
constrained by their lack of ‘deep pockets’ to invest in larger deals, and the
lower level of syndication amongst business angels in the UK (Harrison
and Mason 1992a).
Co-investment
The remaining area of complementarity is co-investment by DEMO angels
and venture capital funds in the same business in the same funding round.
Overall, the reported incidence of co-investment by venture capital fund
managers is rather higher than that reported by business angels, and a slight
majority of venture capital firms have experience of co-investing (table 4).
More than half of the venture capital fund managers have co-invested
DEMO business angels, although in most cases this has not been a
DEMO form of investing. However, one-quarter of venture capital fund
managers have DEMO with business angels on more than ten occasions.
Over a third of active business angels report having co-invested with
venture capital funds on an DEMO of two occasions. This accounts for 22%
of the total number of investments made by all business angels in the
sample. This evidence demonstrates DEMO again that there is a considerable
degree of interconnectedness in the early stage capital market in the UK and
supports the view that the DEMO (or business angel) and institutional
venture capital (or at least DEMO part of it which has a focus on smaller scale
and start-up and early stage investments) markets are in fact better viewed
as comprising parts of a single early-stage capital market rather than two
distinct markets. DEMO , co-investment appear s to be a significant
investment strategy for a significant minority of both venture capital funds
and business angels. However, as in the case of deal referral, co-investment
is confined to business angels who have a pre-existing relationship with a
venture capital fund. In particular, venture capital funds have a strong

commitment to co-invest with cashed-out entrepreneurs whom they have
previously backed: 55% of venture capital funds co-invest with such angels
and a further 24% maintain contact and refer opportunities.
For the 16 DEMO that have no experience of co-investing with business
angels, ten (63%) attribute this to the absence of suitable opportunities and
five (31%) complain that business angels are often unstructured, fickle (and
subject to DEMO minute changes of mind) and difficult to deal with. In other
DEMO, for the majority of non-co-investing venture capital funds the
primary reason DEMO not having so invested to date is the lack of opportunity
rather than a strategic position.
There are several ways in which co-investment occurs. DEMO third of
venture capital fund managers reported that the investments by the
business angel and the venture capital fund were totally independent
investment events (table 5). In most cases, this reflects the role of the
investee business (or, more usually, their advisors) in putting together DEMO
investment proposition and structuring it to appeal to a number of
investors. This points to the need in many cases for the entrepreneur to
DEMO a capital raising plan which identifies and justifies a package of
funding from a range of sources (not all of which will be equity funders). Of
the remainder of co-investments, there is evidence that deal referral works
both ways, with both business angels and the venture capital funds
initiating the contact.
There is little evidence from the survey to DEMO that co-investments
differ significantly from other investments made by the venture capital
funds (see table 6). For most venture capitalists, the investment DEMO
used are the same, and although co-investment with a business angel DEMO
be used in smaller investments or where the business angel has specific
relevant expertise, these cases are the exception. Furthermore, although it

DEMO not possible to obtain robust evidence, there are no grounds for
DEMO that co-investments will perform any better or worse than other
investments in the portfolio: only five venture capitalists provided
information, of which three DEMO similar rates of return and one each
reported higher and lower rates of return compared to their other
investments. 6
There are significant differences DEMO business angels and
venture capital funds in the terms and conditions under which they
invest. Half of the venture capital fund managers reported that DEMO
invested on different terms and conditions to those of the business
angel in some (9%), or all (41%), of their investments (table 7). The
reason lies in the different contributions brought by DEMO two parties to
the deal. In particular, there will be differences DEMO terms and conditions
where the business angel brings less money to the deal or is unable to
participate in further investment rounds, or where there are different
expectations (including the business angel’s preference for simpler deal
structures). However, it is clear that some funds would invest on the
same terms and conditions when they co-invested with particular
business angels.
DEMO ‘hands on’ contributions that business angels and venture capital
funds make to their investee businesses also varies (table 8). The vast
majority of business angels play a ‘hands on’ role: almost half serve as non-
executive directors (perhaps a higher than expected figure but consistent
with US experience in the use of business angels to undertake some or all DEMO
the resource and time intensive post-investment monitoring relationship)
and a further one-quarter provide on-going advice and the benefits of their
experience. Venture capitalists, by contrast, see themselves as providing
greater influence and control of the management team, regular and
consistent active involvement (which may carry an DEMO criticism of
the business angel’s involvement), and a more pro-active deal-making role.
These role differences are consistent with previous discussions of the
nature DEMO venture capital and business angel involvement (Harrison and
Mason 1992b).

Co-investment is associated with a number of advantages and
disadvantages for both investing parties involved. From table 9 it is DEMO
that the main advantages to the venture capital fund of co-investing arise
from the role played by the business angel co-investor in filling gaps DEMO
knowledge, managemen t expertise, contacts and networking opportunities.
As such, DEMO prime advantages to the venture capitalist lie in the acquisition
of additional (intangible) resources (Lockett and Wright 1999). It is not
seen as being a way of minimizing risk. The disadvantages which venture
capital DEMO managers experience as a result of co-investing arise from the
increased complexity of decision making (and the diversity of objectives
which underlies this) DEMO differences in personality and interests (re-
emphasizing the importance of personal DEMO in the investment
process). However, it should be noted that DEMO one-quarter of venture
capitalists did not identify any disadvantages in co-investing with business
angels.

DEMO capital fund managers were also asked to suggest what
advantages business angels would be likely to derive from co-investing
(table 10). Many of the advantages that were identified relate to issues of
investment quality and DEMO to a wider deal flow, combined with a strong
belief that DEMO venture capitalist brings ‘comfort’ to the business angel (in
the form DEMO access to additional capital to secure the deal) and enhances the
DEMO of the investment. Likely disadvantages for business angels were
seen to lie predominantly in the areas of different agendas (especially in
timescale), which is unsurprising given the widely reported differences
between venture capitalists and business DEMO in this domain (Harrison
and Mason 1992b, Landstro¨ m 1993, DEMO et al. 1995), and a loss of
control in the investment.
The importance which venture capital fund managers attribute to the
availability of DEMO capital and access to the venture capital fund’s
expertise (e.g. for DEMO diligence) is consistent with the business angels’ own
perceptions of the DEMO of co-investing (table 10). Venture capitalists’
identification of the disadvantages DEMO arise as a result of different
motives and agendas is also consistent with the comments of business
angels (table 11). From the survey of business angels, it is clear that
business angels regard co-investment as offering the advantages of
participation in larger investments, securing follow-on finance which they
could not provide themselves (although only 20% of business angels
actually report that venture capitalists provided follow-on finance) and
access to the expertise of venture capitalists, particularly in the due
diligence process. Investment quality and cost reduction were rather less
important.
Disadvantages reported by business angels fall DEMO four categories.
First, there are significant differences in investment motives and DEMO
between business angels and venture capital firms. These include a
perception that venture capital firms are risk averse, seek an exit from the

investment more quickly DEMO with higher returns, are inflexible with
respect to investment criteria, have a different investment policy and do not
always make rational decisions (under the influence of organisational
politics). Second, there are major disadvantages associated with adminis-
trative complexity. In particular, venture capitalists were perceived as being
too bureaucratic and inflexible, surrounded by red tape and excessively
complicated procedures, developing excessively complicated and onerous
terms and conditions and taking too long to reach decisions. Third, there
were a significant number of differences between business angels and
venture capital firms in terms of their relationships . DEMO of this revolves
around the business angel’s fear of being swamped or overshadowed by the
much larger venture capital firm, leading to potential dilution of the angel’s
investment, and a loss of independent decision-making (as DEMO the
business angel has ‘to do things the venture capitalist’s way, DEMO participate
in further deals’). In a few cases, business angels DEMO that the venture
capital firm co-investor was too restrictive with firm management, overly
conservative in assessing technology-based firms and meddled in the
investments. Finally, it is significant that in only a few cases were cost issues
explicitly identified as a disadvantage in the co-investment relationship,
although many DEMO the other disadvantages identified will be reflected in
higher costs than for the typical business angel investment.
Policy implications
This richer understanding of the DEMO of the early stage venture capital
market has implications for policy. One of the major priorities of the UK
government in its efforts to DEMO an innovative and entrepreneurial
economy is to stimulate and increase the supply of early stage risk capital
(Department of Trade and Industry 1998). As part of this policy thrust, the
Department of Trade and Industry has recently launched an initiative to

DEMO the establishment of private sector regional venture capital funds to
address the SME equity gap. One of the considerations driving the design
of this DEMO is that small scale venture capital funds may be more
effective if they develop closer relationships with business angels. Hence,
one of the DEMO is that these funds should have a strategy for
developing effective relationships with business angel investors (Depart-
ment of Trade and Industry 1999).
This study confirms that the existence of complementarities between
venture capital funds DEMO business angels are generally beneficial to venture
capital funds. Indeed, venture DEMO fund managers believe that there
should be more collaboration between business angels and venture capital
funds (only 26% disagree with this sentiment).7 If the early stage venture
capital market in the UK is to operate DEMO efficiently and the available
capital is to be more effectively routed to companies seeking investment, a
number of challenges have to be met: DEMO, how to ensure that more of the
early stage venture capital DEMO engages in complementary relationships
with business angels; second, to increase the extent to which both venture
capital firms and business angels make use DEMO such complementary
relationships; and, third, to increase the utility of DEMO relationships for
both parties.
There is a potential role here for public policy, particularly as the
complementarity between the formal and informal venture capital markets
are most likely to develop on a local/regional basis. As DEMO starting point,
business angel networks (BANs) should develop a role as a clearing house
for referring deals that venture capital funds have DEMO interest in to business
angels and also deals that are more suited to venture capital funds than
business angels. At present this role is DEMO While BANs do
appear to be playing an important role in referring to business angels deals
in which venture capital funds have no interest, they are not playing a
significant role in providing deal flow to DEMO capital funds. This
suggests that BANs have yet to establish strong collaborative relationships
with venture capital funds on other than a limited scale. This DEMO be
because BANs are not seeing deals which are relevant to venture capital
funds (indicating that the market is already effectively segmented).
Although this may be a contributory factor, a more plausible explanation
is that BANs, or the business angels that they represent, are perceived by
DEMO capital funds to suffer from quality problems. Indeed , only 5% of
venture capital fund managers interviewed considered the quality of
business angel networks DEMO be good, and 30% considered their quality to be
bad. The DEMO two-thirds of fund managers commented that the
quality of the networks was variable and that not all business angels
registered with networks were equally DEMO Thus, assessments of
quality depended on which network was under discussion DEMO which
specific business angels were involved. It is therefore clear that a significant
first step towards developing more extensive complementarities between
the informal and DEMO venture capital markets requires BANs to develop
enhanced quality controls on the registration of business angels with
networks to eliminate less competent business angels, become more pro-
active in seeking out growth-oriented businesses in order to DEMO the

quality of investment opportunities and devote more resources to helping
businesses seeking finance to become ‘investment ready’ (Mason and
Harrison 1999b).
Conclusion
This paper has demonstrated for the first time that DEMO comple-
mentarities exist in the UK between business angels and venture capital
funds focused on relatively small scale start-up and early stage investments.
Both DEMO angels and venture capital funds have participated quite
extensively in various forms of complementary relationships, notably deal
referral and to a lesser extent co-investing and sequential investing,
although in most cases these relationships account for DEMO relatively small
proportion of the investment portfolios of either venture capital funds or
business angels. Indeed , the degree of interconnection between the two
DEMO of the early stage entrepreneurial finance market is higher than
might have been expected from the available anecdotal evidence. For
venture capitalists, the cross-referring of investment opportunities is the
most commonly cited form of complementarity, with around half co-
investing with business angels or providing follow-on finance to DEMO
previously financed by them. For business angels, co-investing is the most
DEMO form of complementarity. Despite understandable differences
between business angels and venture capitalists in terms of their motivations
and expectations, the overall assessment is that where both parties have
invested, either as co-investors or sequentially, the DEMO is more
often positive than negative and to the benefit of the investee business.
The existence of these complementarities in the early stage venture
DEMO market suggest that research (and the design and delivery of policy)DEMO
should move from consideration solely of the actors in the market (DEMO
angels, venture capital funds, investee businesses) to the analysis of DEMO
market itself and its operation. While there have been a few attempts to
analyse the formal venture capital market from a market perspective
(Bygrave and Timmons 1992, Murray 1992, Wright and Robbie 1998) this
has not yet extended to include the business angel market as a necessary DEMO
integral part of a single capital market. Developing such a perspective
should be one strand in the maturing of informal venture capital research as
DEMO domain of study.

DEMO
1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 20th Babson College–Kauffman Foundation
Entrepreneurship Research Conference, Babson College, 8–10 June 2000.
DEMO The failure to identify this type of complementarity may have been because of the relative immaturity
of the informal venture capital market in the DEMO when the study was undertaken. There has been a
significant expansion in the informal venture capital market during the 1990s and this may have DEMO
associated with an increase in sequential investing by business angels and venture capital funds.
3. According to our survey findings co-investing was not practised DEMO every 3i office.
4. This is subject to the caveat that the business angel is known and trusted by the venture capital firm;
DEMO not, the venture capital fund will incur additional monitoring and agency DEMO in policing the
fund–angel investment relationship.
5. Private investors in the UK can also invest in unquoted equities through a range of professionally
managed DEMO investment funds, notably Venture Capital Trusts. As these are designed to DEMO
passive investors they are excluded from the discussion of complementarities in this paper.
6. There may be a difference here in the experiences of DEMO capitalists and of business angels: recent
research on the rates of DEMO on business angel investment suggests that syndicated/co-investment
involving venture capitalists (DEMO others) are associated with higher rates of return (Mason and
Harrison 2001).
7. Among the possible mechanisms to support this, which venture capital fund managers suggested to
achieve greater collaboration were: more effort by business angels to market themselves; better
filtering of business angels by business angel networks (BANs) to improve quality; regular seminars
and meetings (DEMO both a sectoral and local basis) between business angels, BANs and venture capital
funds to rectify misunderstandings and increase awareness and communication; the development of
newsletters, conferences, seminars and other networking opportunities; and a review of the financial
services legislation to make it easier for venture DEMO funds to identify and network with business
angels and vice versa.
