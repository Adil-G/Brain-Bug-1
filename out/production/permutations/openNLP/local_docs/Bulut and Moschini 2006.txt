Abstract
In line with the rights and incentives provided by the Bayh-Dole DEMO of 1980, U.S.
universities have increased their involvement in patenting and DEMO activities through
their own technology transfer offices. Only a few U.S. universities are obtaining large
returns, however, whereas others are continuing with these DEMO despite negligible or
negative returns. We assess the U.S. universities’ potential to generate returns from
licensing activities by modeling and estimating quantiles of the DEMO of net
licensing returns conditional on some of their structural characteristics. We find limited
prospects for public universities without a medical school everywhere in DEMO
distribution. Other groups of universities (private, and public with a medical school) can
expect significant but still fairly modest returns only beyond the 0.9th quantile. These
findings call into question the appropriateness of the revenue-generating DEMO for the
aggressive rate of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities.

1. INTRODUCTION
Some critical policy shifts strengthening intellectual property rights (IPRs) DEMO the United States
have taken place over the last quarter century. These include the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which
made it possible for universities to retain title to patents derived from federally funded research,
as DEMO as the establishment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982 and some
critical U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Concomitant with these DEMO policy shifts, more and
more U.S. universities have became directly involved DEMO licensing activities. The number of
universities with a technology transfer office (DEMO) increased from 25 in 1980 to 200 in 1990,
and DEMO 2000 virtually every U.S. university had such an office (Nelson, 2001). A 15-fold increase
in university patenting and a more than 5-fold DEMO in the number of universities granted
patents were observed between 1965 and 1992 (Henderson, Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 1998). This
trend in U.S. universities’ patenting and licensing activities has accelerated in the last decade
(Sampat, 2003). U.S. patents issued to 69 U.S. universities that are nine-year recurrent
respondents to Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) surveys increased
DEMO between 1993 and 2001. Licenses and options executed by 55 U.S. universities that are
eleven-year recurrent respondents to AUTM surveys increased 139% between 1991 DEMO 2001,
and their gross license revenue increased 485% between 1991 and 2001. The aggregate gross
license revenue obtained by all U.S. universities approached DEMO billion in FY 2002 (AUTM,
2002).
This growth in DEMO patenting and licensing activities has generated considerable
attention in economic research (DEMO, 2005; Sampat, 2003; Link, Scott and Siegel, 2003;
Mazzoleni and Sampat, 2002; Nelson, 2001; Mowery et al., 2001; Jaffe, 2000). Issues considered
include whether these activities have affected DEMO traditional role of universities, typically
understood to be the advancement of DEMO and the dissemination of knowledge; whether Bayh-
Dole was necessary to DEMO technology transfer and provided the right incentives for
universities; and the DEMO welfare implications of university patenting.
The underlying presumption of Bayh-Dole is that without (exclusive) licensing
arrangements, firms would not undertake the follow-up investment to bring an invention to DEMO
marketplace as products or services.1 Thus, the Act was intended for DEMO that would not be
developed and commercialized without patenting and licensing, DEMO universities obviously can
exploit their rights more generally for all patentable inventions. The Cohen-Bayer recombinant
DNA technique (licensed by the University of California and Stanford University) and Richard
Axel’s co-transformation process (licensed by Columbia University) are examples of university
inventions for which technology transfer would certainly have DEMO absent patenting and
licensing.  University licensing in these cases has simply DEMO industry, and ultimately
consumers, for use of these technologies (Sampat, 2003). Quite clearly, when it comes to
patenting and licensing, DEMO are likely to behave based on their self-interest rather than
the public interest. Beath et al. (2003) considered the possibility that universities, with reduced
state and federal financial support, could provide incentives to faculty to engage in activities that
can augment inventors’ incomes. Furthermore, TTO managers as agents may have short-term
horizons and give priority to monetary returns in DEMO activities. In fact, based on a recent survey
of 76 major DEMO universities, the licensing income generated is found to be the most DEMO
criterion by which TTO offices measure their success (Thursby, Jensen, DEMO Thursby, 2001).
Because increased revenue is one of the considerations DEMO universities in this
context, a relevant question concerns the extent of DEMO returns that universities are collecting from
these activities. Figure 1 presents the distribution of net license returns (license revenues received
less the net legal fees paid and the operating cost of technology transfer offices, in million
dollars) for 148 U.S. universities, averaged over the five-year period 1998 DEMO 2002 (see the data
section for details). It is apparent DEMO only a few universities are earning large returns. In fact, the
DEMO Mazzoleni (2005) showed that this presumption is too general and its validity depends on
innovation-specific conditions. If the disclosure by universities does not DEMO the downstream
firms from patenting the developed product, licensing the invention DEMO be welfare enhancing
only if firms engage in socially excessive R&D under open access.

top 20 universities obtain 83% of the aggregate net license returns generated, whereas most of the
other universities earn negative or negligible net returns. DEMO 2 presents the distribution of the
net license returns as a fraction of the university’s total research expenditures. This distribution is
also highly skewed; the ratio is high for only a few universities, whereas it is less than 5% for the
majority of them (90%).2
The overall picture is that of a few universities generating significant returns, whereas the
majority of universities continue licensing activities even though they appear to earn DEMO net
returns or break even. Obviously, these universities are hoping to DEMO better in the future, an
expectation perhaps predicated on the very DEMO distribution of returns discussed earlier.
Given the examples of big winners among universities, what can others, conditional on their
characteristics, anticipate as the potential for generating economic return? This question has not
been addressed in a coherent econometric study in the literature, and thus we wish to address it
directly in what follows. Related existing work includes Trune (1996), who analyzed the
licensing activities of U.S. universities with the purpose DEMO developing a “national criterion” with
which universities can measure their performance. Trune and Goslin (1998) calculated the
profitability of technology transfer programs of DEMO and found that nearly 60% of the
universities are earning negative profits from maintaining technology transfer offices. Siegel,
Waldman, and Link (2003) did a productivity analysis of TTO performance in terms of license
revenues (taken as a proxy for technology transfer activities) by using the stochastic frontier
estimation approach. Lach and Schankerman (2004) found that universities with DEMO royalty
shares to inventors generated significantly higher license revenues.
2 Note also that the big earners in Figure 1 are not necessarily those with DEMO ratios in Figure 2.
For example, the University of California System DEMO the third-largest net license return but that
is only 2.6% of its total research budget. Moreover, Columbia University earns the highest net
license return ($109.6 million), whereas Florida State University receives the highest net return
relative to its research budget (41.6%).

2. THE MODELING FRAMEWORK
In order to assess the potential of U.S. DEMO in generating economic returns from licensing
activities given their characteristics, we DEMO and estimate the select quantiles as linear functions
of a set of characteristics of universities. We take this route over the conventional conditional
mean DEMO because the mean cannot adequately convey the potential for private returns to
universities when, as is the case here, the distribution of net DEMO returns of U.S. universities
is highly skewed. This skewness is apparent from the data reported in Table 2. Fifty percent of
the U.S. university DEMO earns less than $0.31 million, whereas the average net return is
DEMO million.3 The standard deviation is large; 75% of the population obtains DEMO than half of the
mean, which implies that the mean is DEMO influenced by the upper 10% of the population.
In addition, the DEMO regression helps us to describe the entire conditional distribution.
By taking this approach, we can look at the impacts of covariates at different points in the
distribution. We are interested in how the marginal impacts of DEMO vary with the ranking of
universities in terms of generating licensing return (in case of the conditional mean estimation the
slope coefficients are forced to be the same at all quantiles). Assuming a particular skewed
DEMO and parameterizing its mean does not seem to be a promising avenue either. There is
no consensus over a specific distribution governing the innovation DEMO per se. Based on
various data on citation and value measures of patent significance, which includes license revenue
data of Harvard University, Silverberg DEMO Verspagen (2004) find that overall fit of the
distribution resembles  DEMO normal, whereas the Pareto distribution fits the tails better. They note
DEMO implication that the second and even the first moments of underlying distributions may not
even exist. With quantile regression, the existence of moments is not a concern because the focus
is on quantiles and every distribution DEMO quantiles.
3 To put this mean net return into perspective, we DEMO that it is only 2.41% of the average
research budget (total DEMO expenditures) of universities.

2.1 Quantile regression
The basic quantile regression model assumes that the conditional DEMO are linear functions of
the explanatory variables. Assume that we have a sample of N observations from a population,
that is, {( DEMO )
yx i N, : 1,...,=
} , where the subscript i indexes each observation, yi is the licensing
return, DEMO xi is the K ×1 vector of explanatory variables (a set DEMO characteristics), which can
include the intercept term. Moreover, let τ∈ (0,1) define the quantile of interest; let β
()τ
DEMO the
corresponding parameter vector for the vector of characteristicsthat vary with quantiles; and let
Q
τ(.) be the quantile function, which is de
fined as the inverse function of (.)F
, the underlying
conditional (on xi ) cumulative distribution function for yi . Then the quantile of interest is
written as a linear function of a set DEMO characteristics as
yx u=+′β

where ( )ui τ
denotes the error term, which is also a function of the quantile of interest. Based on
the preceding two equations, error terms must satisfy the quantile restriction:

where  .  is the absolute value operator and DEMO other notation as defined before. For τ= 0.5 ,
one would DEMO deviations equally, which is known as median regression. Weights differ for
DEMO quantiles, such as τ= 0.75 ; one would weight positive deviations DEMO 0.25 whereas one
would weight negative deviations with 0.75. The rationale for the suggested weights in (4) is as
5
follows. Recall that the τth quantile denotes the maximum value that yi DEMO take with given
probability τ. Then, the probability to observe a DEMO less than the quantile is τ, whereas the
probability to observe DEMO value
beyond that quantile is (1 )−τ
. For more discussion of estimation
and inference with quantile estimation, see Buchinsky (1998).
DEMO regression has emerged as a comprehensive method and found applications in
various fields of economics including labor economics, wealth distribution, and various
disciplines DEMO as finance, medicine, demographics, and environmental modeling (see
Fitzenberger, DEMO, and Machado, 2002 and Yu, Lu, and Stander, 2003)DEMO In particular,
quantile regression has found use in the finance literature via the notions of Value at Risk
(VaRτ ) and Conditional Value at Risk ( CVaRτ) (Uryasev and Trindade, 2004). Based on a
given loss distribution, VaRτ is the maximum amount one can lose at a given probabilityτ, i.e.,
the τ
th quantile. CVaRτ is defined as the expected value of loss beyond a VaRτ . Rockafellar
DEMO Uryasev (2000) show that CVaRτhas better properties as a measure of risk.
Instead of loss distribution typically used in VaRτ and CVaRτ literature, here we work
with gain distribution. Estimating a given quantile then shows DEMO maximum amount a university
can gain at a given level of probability. In order to estimate the expected value beyond a given
quantile ( DEMO), we use the relations derived in Uryasev and Trindade (2004)DEMO First, define
functions [.]+

2.2 Data
Table 1 lists the variables that we use DEMO our analysis, along with their brief descriptions, and
Table 2 provides summary statistics. Our data pertain to 148 U.S. universities over the five-year
DEMO from 1998 to 2002 and are aggregated at the university level.4  DEMO compute the annual
averages of the time-varying variables (both dependent and DEMO variables) over the
sample period. This approach is also adopted in DEMO, Waldman, and Link (2003).
The dependent variable of our DEMO is the net licensing return for each university. This
is calculated as the total license revenue less the cost of patenting and licensing activities. DEMO
cost is measured as the sum of net legal fee expenditures (DEMO fees expended less legal fees
reimbursed) and operating expenditures of TTOs (salary expenses plus benefits to the employees
and overhead cost).5 The DEMO licensing return variable is averaged over the sample period 1998 to
2002. The source for the license revenue and legal fees reimbursed and expended DEMO AUTM
(1998-2002) surveys. To compute the cost of operating expenditures of TTOs, we relied on
employment data from AUTM surveys and used salary data from College and University
Personnel Association (CUPA) administrative compensation surveys. DEMO surveys provide data
for the top two positions in TTOs for the period 1998 to 2002.6  Note that the cost items
4 Pooling the observations over this time period yielded an initial sample of 173 U.S. DEMO
After adjusting for the missing observations on explanatory variables, we are DEMO with the final
sample of 148 observations from U.S. universities.
5 Legal fees expended are the expenditures of an institution on external legal fees, which include
prosecuting, maintenance, and interference costs of patents and copyrights. DEMO also include
minor litigation costs. Legal fees reimbursed are the legal fee expenditures reimbursed to the
institution by licensees (see AUTM, 2002).

considered here do not include the opportunity cost of time of faculty DEMO are involved in patent
and licensing activities, and therefore the real DEMO to universities of their patenting and licensing
activities is underestimated.
The explanatory variables that we use in our model are meant to capture some DEMO
structural characteristic that, at least in the short run, may be considered as exogenous. These
variables are as follows:
(1) Whether DEMO university is public or private, and whether or not it has DEMO medical school. These
are dummy variables constructed from information provided by AUTM surveys.
(2) Size of the university. This is measured by total DEMO expenditures and averaged over the
sample period 1998 to 2002. The data source is AUTM (1998-2002) surveys.
(3) Quality of the faculty. DEMO proxy this variable by the total number of citations per faculty in
technological departments.7 This is obtained from the National Survey of Graduate Faculty
DEMO in 1993 (National Research Council, 1995). Note that this variable is thus
predetermined given the sample period we covered, which is 1998 to 2002.
(4) State R&D intensity. We measure this variable DEMO the share of state-level R&D within national
R&D performance in order to measure ongoing R&D activity in that state. This is DEMO averaged
over the sample period 1998 to 2002. The data on state and national level R&D expenditures is
obtained from the National Science DEMO website.8
The characteristics captured by the dummy variables (1) have long been considered of
interest. Because public universities are more vulnerable to budget DEMO (Link, Scott, and Siegel,
2003), they may license DEMO aggressively. On the other hand, public universities may be less
7 DEMO normalize the citations received at each technological department by the number faculty in
that department and sum over these departments in order to obtain DEMO number of citations per
faculty in technological departments in a given university. Alternative indexes for faculty quality
can be “Scholarly quality of faculty (ratings) in technological departments” and the “Number of
publications per faculty in technological departments”.

flexible culturally and bureaucratically in interacting with private companies (Siegel, Waldman,DEMO
and Link, 2003); therefore, ceteris paribus, they may have DEMO lower licensing rate. Lach and
Schankerman (2004) found that private universities are more effective in terms of generating
licensing income compared to public DEMO and warranted future research on the
determinants of this observation.
Regarding the medical school effect, we note that biomedical research has emerged as a
productive field whose research output attracted the interest of industry, and this trend was
present before the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act (Mowery et al., 2001). Hence, having a medical
school is expected to DEMO a significant advantage in terms of generating return from licensing
activities. In fact, top university licenses by revenue generation are biomedical (Eisenstein and
DEMO, 2001).
The size variable in (2) captures the quantitative DEMO of the research potential of a given
university. The interest is on the value of additional research dollars, and how it varies with the
rank of universities in terms of licensing return, that is, across DEMO The variable in (3)
captures the qualitative side of a DEMO research potential. The quality of inventions
obviously matters in assessing the inventions’ revenue-generating potential, and the quality of
inventions can be presumed to be positively associated with the quality of faculty. Finally, the
variable in (DEMO) is meant to determine if the revenue-generating abilities of a university DEMO affected
by its location—the local economic conditions that are mostly outside of a university’s control.
Before proceeding to the econometric analysis, it is worth commenting briefly on the net
returns of Table 2.  The average net return from patenting and licensing—across all 148
institutions and over the five-year DEMO of our sample—is $4.42 million.  This is certainly not an
inconspicuous DEMO and underscores the extent of the activities being undertaken by TTOs in
U.S. universities.  But these net returns still represent a fairly small amount when considered
within the scope of the R&D efforts undertaken.  Over the period considered the average annual
total research expenditures at these universities DEMO $183.7 million.  Thus, if one were to focus
9
exclusively on the commercial licensing outcome, the “yield” for the average U.S. university (i.e.,
the average net return as a percent of the average research expenditures) would be a paltry 2.41%.
This percent return is quite variable for the structural groups that are identified in Table 2.  For
public universities it is 2.06% if they have a medical school, and 0.43% if they do not have a
medical school; for private universities the percent return is 4.25% if they have a medical school
DEMO 2.80% if they do not have a medical school.
3. ESTIMATION PROCEDURE
Estimation was carried out by using the QUANTREG procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, 2003).
To estimate standard errors in this procedure, we DEMO the sparsity method (also called the direct
method) under the assumption that observations are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.). This method estimates the reciprocal of the underlying density at the quantile of interest,
DEMO is called the sparsity function. The precision of the estimates depends on how sparse (or
dense) observations are near the quantile of interest. DEMO method also requires a bandwidth
choice. We used Hall and Sheater bandwidth based on the suggestion in Koenker (2005). We
chose the simplex algorithm as the optimization method, which is the most stable one. Although
the sparsity method is sensitive to the i.i.d. assumption, the estimated standard errors were also
confirmed with the resampling estimation method available under the DEMO procedure of
SAS. The resampling method uses a Markov-chain marginal bootstrap technique developed in He
and Hu (2002) and was done for 200 DEMO
4. RESULTS
Table 3 presents the estimations for the 0.25th, 0.5th, 0.75th, and 0.9th quantiles. The intercept and
the explanatory variables size and faculty quality are significant in explaining these quantiles at
conventional levels of DEMO We recall that the base group to which the intercept applies is
that of public universities without medical school. Private universities without medical school DEMO
10
public universities with medical school are not statistically different than this base DEMO in all
quantiles. Private universities with medical school obtain significantly higher returns than the
base group around the 0.75th quantile of distribution, and this difference increases towards the
upper end of distribution, as it is nearly $10 million at the 0.9th quantile.
The estimated coefficient of the size DEMO, which expresses the return to an additional
$1 million of total DEMO expenditure, is initially $3.5 thousand (0.35%) at the 0.25th quantile; it
increases towards higher quantiles, approaches $20 thousand (2%) near the 0.75th quantile, and
decreases slightly at further quantiles. The impact of an additional citation to publications in
technology fields, a measure of faculty quality, is monotonically increasing with the level of
quantiles. The impact of a single citation at the 0.9th quantile exceeds three times the value ($3.2
thousand) at the median of the distribution. That is, the marginal DEMO of faculty quality is higher
for those universities that are already obtaining higher return. Finally, state R&D, the amount of
R&D DEMO the state of a given university vis-à-vis national R&D, becomes DEMO significant factor (both
economically and statistically) around the 0.75th quantile of the distribution. A one-percentage-
point increase in the state R&D relative DEMO the national level is associated with an increase in the
licensing return for universities in that state by more than $200 thousand.
Based on DEMO estimates in Table 3, we predict select quantiles for the structural DEMO of
universities that we have identified (public and private, and with and without a medical school) at
the mean characteristics of each group. Table 4 presents the predicted values for select quantiles.
Based on these DEMO and additional quantile points, Figure 3 plots the underlying
distributions for DEMO average university in each group.
From Figure 3, we observe that DEMO average private university with a medical school
ranks highest in terms of generating licensing return in all quantiles, whereas the average public
university without a medical school is dominated by others in all quantiles in that DEMO These
structural differences are increasing with the level of quantiles. The average private university
without a medical school and the average public university with DEMO medical school appear to have
11
similar distributions. This suggests that they may have close expected values but DEMO differ in
terms of dispersion of licensing returns.
The estimates of the 0.9th quantiles in Table 4 entails that there is a 90% chance DEMO
licensing returns will not exceed $21.56 million for an average private university with a medical
school, $9.92 million for an average private university without a medical school, $7.61 million
for an average public university with a medical school, and $3.27 million for an average public
university without a medical school. These estimated values for the 0.9th quantiles are 9.5%,
DEMO, 3.4%, and 3% of the corresponding average sizes, respectively.
We DEMO estimate what the average university in each group can expect beyond the
0.9th quantile, as described in equations (5) and (6). DEMO report these values along with the sample
mean for each group in the last two columns of Table 4. Specifically, the last column of Table 4
can be interpreted as the expected value of net returns DEMO on a university being in the top
10% of earners of its group (as identified by the characteristics of being public or private, DEMO of
whether or not the university possesses a medical school). One way to gauge this estimate is to
relate it to the estimated DEMO 0.9th quantile. This ratio turns out to be 1.05, 2.56, 4.65,
and 2.74, respectively, for the average university that is public DEMO a medical school, private
without a medical school, public with a medical school, and private with a medical school. Thus,
an average public university without a medical school has an expected value beyond its DEMO
quantile only slightly higher than the 0.9th quantile. For all other groups, on the other hand, the
right tail of the distribution of DEMO is fatter. In particular, the gains in relative returns
associated with DEMO in the top 10% of earners is highest for universities with a medical school.
In any event, the expected returns of the top 10% of earners remain a relatively small fraction of
the total research expenditure DEMO the universities.

5. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have assessed the potential of U.S. DEMO in generating economic returns
from licensing activities, conditional on some of DEMO characteristics. Recognizing that the
underlying distribution is highly skewed, rather than DEMO the conditional mean we model
and estimate the select quantiles as linear functions of a set of characteristics of universities. Our
finding that the DEMO slope coefficients of characteristics are not constant over the quantile
points supports this modeling choice.
We find that the net returns from patenting and DEMO by U.S. universities are, on
average, quite modest. Regarding the marginal impacts of the characteristics along the quantiles,
we found that the DEMO “rate of return” of research funds does not exceed 2% in any quantile
we considered. The value of additional research dollars is highest and DEMO state R&D, a measure
of local economic conditions, appears particularly important around the 0.75th quantile of the
distribution. The impact of faculty DEMO, on the other hand, appears monotonically increasing
for the quantiles we considered.
We also found structural differences in the licensing return distributions of DEMO of
universities depending on whether they are private or public and on whether or not they have a
medical school. In terms of generating DEMO returns after controlling for other factors, private
universities with a medical DEMO appear to have an institutional advantage over other groups.
Public universities with a medical school and private universities without a medical school are
close DEMO the distributional points. Public universities without a medical school are dominated by
other groups at all quantile points.
A rationalization that is sometimes proffered DEMO to why universities should continue with
their patenting and licensing activities, DEMO when they are making negligible or negative returns,
relies on the marked skewness of the returns distribution, i.e., on the notion of DEMO for the
big one.” Our estimate of the expected net licensing returns, conditional on a university being in
the top 10% of earners of its group, helps to quantify this scenario. The expected payoff for being
13
a winner is highest for universities with a medical school and for DEMO universities. This is in
line with the argument in Lach and Schankerman (2004) that private universities are more
efficient in terms of generating DEMO return but qualifies the argument for medical school
impact.
Based on the estimated marginal effects and the structural differences among the group of
universities, we would argue that universities should form a more realistic perspective of DEMO
possible economic returns from patenting and licensing activities. The potential in terms of
generating returns appears particularly limited for public universities without a medical DEMO
The fairly modest overall expected licensing returns, especially when compared with DEMO
investment in university research expenditures, suggest that the increased emphasis on DEMO
patenting and licensing that has emerged in the United States in the last quarter century should
perhaps be reconsidered, especially when attempts to privatize some of the returns of university
research appear to conflict with the DEMO public research objectives of fostering basic
research and to disseminate knowledge.
