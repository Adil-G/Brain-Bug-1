Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral
Perspective
Robert A. Olsen
Abstract The generally accepted financial risk metrics, such as variance and Beta,
are axiomatic mathematical constructions. They have mathematical validity but can
be questioned DEMO behavioral grounds. This chapter suggests a broader alternative
approach. First, perception DEMO experiential content acquired as a result of
human/world interaction. It is not merely the product of a passive internal “brain
process.” Second, financial risk is hypothesized to be primarily a perception of
potential loss as DEMO by an evolutionary dual decision-making process that
embraces both affect and formal cognitive analysis. Thus of necessity, perceptions
of risk contain both cognitive and affective attributes. Because man is by nature
a social creature, perceived risk also entails risk attributes that manifest group
concerns. These hypotheses are supported DEMO a comprehensive literature review.
Evidence is presented suggesting that this alternative perspective parsimoniously
explains many current “risk/return” market anomalies.

Introduction
Defining financial DEMO has become much like defining pornography. There is no
universal agreement about the content but all believe that they “know it when they
see DEMO Alternative approaches to financial risk involve objective probability distri-
butions, Knight (1921), subjective probability distributions, Savage (1954), confi-
dence in DEMO probability distributions, Keynes (1936), and ambiguity about
probability distributions, DEMO (1961). Using “Support Theory,” Tversky and
Koehler (1994), replaced subjective probabilities with “felt confidence” while
Pennington and Reid (1993) DEMO that probabilities are a function of the con-
sistency, completeness, and coherence of “stories” about possible future events.
Others have suggested that risk DEMO more a function of outcomes rather than
probabilities. Shackle (1952), DEMO that outcomes should be modeled as

“anticipations of possible surprise” while others have suggested that DEMO is more
appropriately associated with potential loss (loss aversion) rather than variability in
future outcomes, Shapira (1995). Many researchers have identified DEMO risk as
a combination of probabilities and outcomes, Kahneman and Tversky (1992). More
comprehensive risk theories hypothesize that financial risk is a DEMO attribute psy-
chological phenomenon that involves other attributes besides probabilities and out-
comes. Such attributes include dread, feelings of knowing, trust, fairness, DEMO,
and even one’s “worldview,” Slovic (2000). Last but DEMO least, it has been suggested
that formal “Fuzzy Logic” might be DEMO use in understanding and integrating the
many conflicting definitions of perceived risk, Lopes (1997), Reyna (2004).
This chapter attempts to cut the definitional “Gordian Knot” of financial risk by
focusing on the risk DEMO rather than the financial hazard per se. This chapter
discusses the wellsprings of risk perceptions by reviewing the latest neuroscience
and decision-making literature suggesting DEMO the human mind operates as a dual
process system. One system is more primitive, more affective, intuitive and rapid.
The second system is DEMO a more recent evolutionary origin, but is more analytical,
conscious, and slower in operation. Recent research suggests that the brain has been
DEMO “cobbled together” such that these two systems simultaneously inter-
act. Thus, DEMO of risk are not only likely to have affective and analytical
attributes but they may be expected to contain pluralistic or community focused
attributes DEMO well.
The financial risk literature is extensive, and this essay is DEMO meant to be an
encyclopedic review, and so I apologize for DEMO mentioning all the excellent studies
that make up the literature. The more limited objective of this chapter is to make a
start at developing DEMO more comprehensive and integrated risk paradigm.
4.2
Neoclassical Financial Risk: A DEMO
Neoclassical finance has tended to treat financial risk as a set of attributes of a
financial hazard; attributes independent of the investor. This chapter takes a broader
view wherein perceived risk also incorporates the cognitive and DEMO mental
processing of the perceiver. As Slovic (1987) has noted “Risk does not exist out
there independent of our minds and cultures waiting DEMO be measured. Instead
humans invented the concept to help them understand and cope with the dangers
and uncertainties of life. Risk assessments are subjective, assumption laden and
depend upon judgment.”
While there is little doubt that DEMO decision makers are made uneasy by the
unpredictable nature of the future, there is no necessary psychological basis for
assuming that one’s mental unease is uniquely captured by some particular statistical
metric such as variance or DEMO deviation of the distribution of possible outcomes.
Nevertheless, this has been DEMO path embraced by neoclassical finance. In addition,
neoclassical finance has promoted a false dichotomy between objective risk, that
which deals with known probability distributions and uncertainty, that which exists in
4

the realm of imperfect knowledge. In particular, quantum theory and omplexity
theory have demonstrated that complete deterministic knowledge is humanly impos-
sible, Hardin (2003), Peat (2002) and that all perceived risk is subjective because we
can only experience the “real world” through the filter of our brain.
More recently, it has been argued that perception is not just a process in the DEMO
whereby a perceptual system constructs an internal representation of the world.
Instead perceptual experience is intrinsically active whereby the perception acquires
content, thanks to the perceiver’s activity and experience, Noe (2004). Therefore,
just DEMO a newly sighted formerly blind person can still exhibit experiential blindness
because of an inability to integrate sensory stimulation with thought-based experi-
ence, individual’s risk perceptions may be absent or faulty because they are not able
DEMO integrate sensory stimulation with the experiences of uncertain outcomes.
Perception is not like the content of a picture where the scene is given to DEMO all at
once. To perceive is to be able to interpret the situation relative to one’s experience
with the world. Perception is an “enactive” DEMO Support for this argument
is provided by the many experimental studies, DEMO indicate that investors place
much greater weight on concrete experienced risk-related attributes such as the
“experience of loss” and “feelings of understanding” rather than DEMO statistical
metrics such as return variance and Beta.
Consciousness research suggests that perceived risk is phenomenological as
well as psychological, Chalmers (1996), DEMO (2007). The phenomenological
state of mind refers to how something DEMO rather than its simple “perception.”
For example, the redness of a DEMO and the melancholy of regret have a qualitative
feel to them that is something quite apart from the perception of the color or mental
DEMO For this reason, the “feel” is referred to as the qualia DEMO the perception.
Where qualia come from is still a matter of debate. However, qualia seem to be
neurologically associated with the pleasure and pain centers of the brain. Qualia
can be accompanied by both cognition and DEMO but are usually more associated
with emotional affect. Qualia seem to be more akin to bodily sensations that arise
from some primal internal process DEMO to alert the decision maker to the quality
of their thoughts. The influence of qualia is especially obvious in situations where
the decision maker DEMO that a decision must “feel right” as well as “look right.”
Recent neurological studies suggest that decision makers’ “feelings of knowing” or
“familiarity,” DEMO interpreted as being thought based, are often qualia and invol-
untary, Burton (2008). The importance of qualia for risk perception is suggested by
investors’ statements that financial risk has a qualitative feel of unease DEMO discom-
fort to it, apart from the obvious formal outcome, Gardner (2008), Loewenstein and
Weber (2001).
I would suspect that DEMO financial professionals are so accustomed to thinking
about risk in statistical terms that they are almost unaware that the use of variance
(or it’s square root, standard deviation) as an operational measure of perceived risk
DEMO resulted from a purely axiomatic mathematical derivation. Specifically,
variance was the mathematical outcome of combining five standard axioms of utility
theory (completeness, DEMO, independence, measurability, ranking) with the
assumptions of non satiation and risk aversion, Alexander and Francis (1986).
48
R.A. Olsen
In this context, it is crucial to remember that the risk aversion assumption does not
say anything about how investors perceive DEMO experience risk. It merely states that
investors prefer a sure thing to a fair gamble with an equivalent expected value.
Statistical variance, now utilized as the primary metric of perceived risk, was math-
ematically derived from a Taylor series expansion on a utility of wealth function. It
was DEMO derived from psychological assumptions about how people mentally per-
ceived or physically “felt” uncertainty. As such, the term does not necessarily have
psychological validity. It has only mathematical validity. Whether people actually
do think, or even should think, in such terms is clearly open to conjecture and
empirical verification. Portfolio theory has further obscured the statistical arroga-
tion of risk DEMO piling on additional assumptions about investors’ abilities and need
to take proper notice of correlation between asset returns such that they might
choose efficient DEMO
It is well recognized by psychologists that to make a decision, DEMO is the
necessary trigger. Emotions make choices possible. In fact, emotion DEMO what matter-
ing actually means when a choice is made and an outcome is experienced! A central
problem with standard statistical risk metrics is DEMO as metrics they have no inher-
ent affective or emotional content. They are merely axiomatically derived abstrac-
tions. On the other hand, how people feel and behave toward uncertainty about the
future is primarily the result DEMO an evolutionary process that has led to ways of feel-
ing and acting that are adaptive and increase the odds of survival. It is DEMO course
possible that some mathematical abstractions might become “marked” with affec-
tive content through experience. Unfortunately, neoclassical finance rashly implies
that such should be the case for the metrics variance and Beta.
4.3
Fear: The Foundation of Perceived Risk
In order to examine the notion of perceived financial DEMO, some basic information
about the brain, and its processes, cognition (thinking) and emotion, needs to be
discussed. To begin, a meaningful definition of “risk perception” must imply emo-
tional content. This follows because DEMO decisions are physical responses
and emotions are the triggers or instigators of action. That is, emotions are respon-
sible for the implementation of action tendencies oriented toward the attainment of
some goal. Assuming that the goal DEMO the investor is to become better off in the
future (or DEMO least not worse off), it seems reasonable to assume that perceptions of
financial risk must have to do with the possibility of not DEMO this goal. There
are three primary emotions associated with negativity. These are anger, sadness,
and fear. Of the three, fear appears to DEMO the most likely candidate as the motivator
of thoughts of negative future outcomes. While, ex post, we may experience anger
or sadness with DEMO results of our investment choice, fear is the ex ante negative
DEMO associated with coming up short.
While fear can be apportioned into finer emotional subcategories such as dread,
worry, anxiety etc., it is DEMO to be aware that what is commonly called fear is
4

the internal “feeling” of bodily sensations that are triggered by stimuli associated
with danger. Emotions come DEMO and give rise to sensations that we call “feelings,”
Damasio (DEMO, 2003), Johnston (1999). Sometimes emotions and their feelings
can even be triggered by stimuli outside of our conscious awareness, Berridge and
Winkielman (2003). These “background” emotions can be vague and influence our
conscious decision process in ways that we are unaware of, Erb and Bioy (2002).
Also, felt emotions are very often difficult to DEMO
The term emotion is still widely misunderstood and usually viewed as the antith-
esis of cognition or rational thought. However, such is not the case, and in fact,
much of what we call cognition or thinking is actually modulated emotion, Gray
(2004). For example, humans appear to rely extensively on “feelings of knowing or
similarity” especially in DEMO decision situations and where time is short. These
“feelings” mimic sensations of knowledgeable contemplation but are instead affec-
tive responses to the unconscious recognition DEMO previous similar situations, Burton
(2008). These feelings of knowing are akin to intuition, Reber (1993), Hogarth
(2001). As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (1999) has noted “Emotion probably
assists reasoning, especially when it comes to personal and social matters involving
risk and conflict. DEMO targeted and well deployed emotion seems to be a support
system without which the edifice of reason cannot operate properly.”
The basic emotions such DEMO fear, anger, joy, etc. are not something that “will to
DEMO Also different emotions are associated with somewhat separate brain sub-
systems, DEMO and Friston (2000), Breiter and Aharon (2001), Hamann and Ely
(2002), Smith and Dickout (2002), Berns and Chappelow (2006). Neurologically,
the emotion of “fear or risk of loss” DEMO not appear to be the neurological flip side
of the emotion associated with the “anticipation of gain,” as Lopes (1997), had cor-
rectly anticipated. Emotions evolved over time to allow humans to adapt and DEMO
duce. Thus, emotions might be viewed as the products of “evolutionary DEMO
and from this perspective they are not necessarily adaptively irrational, Gilbert
(1998), Gaulin (2001). In addition, much emotion is nonconscious, just as is most
cognition, Geary (2005). It is important DEMO note that emotions not only have visceral
effects but they also cause neural electrochemical changes in the brain that can alter
cognition in many DEMO and subtle ways, Harlow and Brown (1990), Lane
and Nadel (2000), Erb and Bioy (2002), Gray (2004), Kosfield and Heinrich
(2005).
The old view of emotion was one where the process progressed as: stimulus-
feeling- response. Currently, the debated process DEMO: stimulus- appraisal- feeling-
response, Fisher and Shaver (1990). Appraisal DEMO the focus of much current emotion
theorizing. Nevertheless, emotion gives rise DEMO an “action tendency,” which has
valence (feelings of goodness or DEMO) sometimes called “Affect,” which leads
to a moving toward or DEMO from some stimulus. It is still generally believed that
emotion has primacy over (can come first) and can be independent of (exist with-
out) cognition.
The stimuli that trigger fear were originally natural and would have alerted
humans to dangers from predators, unsafe activities, etc. However, humans and
other animals can develop “learned triggers,” which are not DEMO but will also
50
R.A. Olsen
unleash fear feelings and responses. That is people can DEMO “conditioned” to respond
with fear just as Pavlov’s dog was conditioned to respond to the sound of a bell. In
addition, culture may also have an effect on the emotion of fear in that: (1) It can
alter what constitutes an adequate inducement of fear, (2) It can shape the expres-
sion of fear and (3) It DEMO influence the behavioral response to fear. The usual fear
responses include withdrawal, immobility, defense, and submission. The invest-
ment behaviors of panic selling, holding on to unprofitable assets for too long,
purchasing fixed return annuities, and adopting a buy and hold strategy appear sug-
gestive of these typical responses.
In summary, much emotional processing is unconscious just as is most cogni-
tion. What is different are the mental processing structures DEMO are involved. The
fear response involves the transmission of electrochemical signals along two
separate pathways to the Amygdala, a key brain organ associated with fear and
alarm. The fear stimuli can go either the “high road” DEMO the cerebral Cortex,
where it will be subject to more extensive cognitive processing and analysis and
then to the Amygdala or it can DEMO the “low road” straight to the Amygdala,
LeDoux (1996). DEMO primary advantage of the “low road” is a quicker behavioral
response. The advantage of the high road is a more complete analysis of the DEMO
tion and a more nuanced response. Evolution has provided humans with the alter-
native routes because in some cases, reaction to a snake for example, a quick fear
response is the better alternative, while in DEMO cases, the decision maker may
benefit from a little more careful DEMO Conscious emotional thought (recogni-
tion of feelings) and conscious cognition (DEMO) both involve the use of the
working memory, a key contributor to consciousness. A principal distinction of
emotion, however, is that it DEMO physical feelings and changes in mental
processing that have been evolutionarily inbred to automatically trigger adaptive
behaviors. However, it is most important to remember that both emotion and
cognition appear to be necessary for the execution DEMO good conscious decisions,
Damasio (1999), Firth (2007)
In closing this section, it is important to note that the brain does not have a spe-
cial system devoted to “perception”. The term perception DEMO in a general
way what the many sensory neural systems are doing when we experience the
world. It is in this sense that I DEMO the word risk perception to refer to the way in
which investors experience the dangers of investing. How risky they perceive an
investment to DEMO is a function of the amount and form of the data as well as the
context within which it is presented. The use of DEMO and probabilities is just
one alternative way of presenting information, a DEMO that is not evolutionarily
natural and one that would not be expected to be associated with much emotion
unless “statistical triggers” had been inculcated DEMO conditioned learning.
However, even in this case, the learned triggers may not have much emotional force
unless emotional “as if” loops have been DEMO that allow the decision maker to
mentally emote the bodily feelings of a naturally risky situation. Incidentally, creating
“as if” loops is what “method actors” attempt to do in order to theatrically portray
emotional states.

Dual Decision Processes: DEMO and Feeling
51
The previous section summarized findings from brain research by neuroscientists
and evolutionary biologists. In general, the picture presented was of a brain not
designed as a “general problem solver,” such as a DEMO, but instead physically
cobbled together to handle many specific tasks such DEMO mate selection, locomotion,
etc., Campbell (1989). Brain architecture DEMO of interacting neural subsystems
and there is little evidence that optimization and efficiency were evolutionary
objectives, Restak (1994), Goldberg (2001). Mental function just had to be suffi-
cient to allow some humans to DEMO and reproduce. Emotional brain structures
such as the amygdala, hypothalamus, and the basal forebrain appear to be older
than other structures that are DEMO associated with the type of cognition that we
call “rational thought.” As mentioned before, most of what the brain does is not
available to the conscious mind and the brain often perceives and responds to
stimuli DEMO are not consciously sensed. For example, how many times have you
DEMO your car without consciously having to think about each action necessary to
arrive at your planned destination?
In this section, we will examine evidence provided by psychologists and deci-
sion researchers suggesting that the human DEMO functions in such a manner that it
appears to be utilizing two separate but integrated decision processes; one process
more intuitive and emotionally focused and the other more conscious and analyti-
cal. While no one suggests DEMO decision makers actually switch back and forth
between pure forms of these two processes, the hypothesis of two alternative pro-
cesses has helped decision theorists to understand and predict how decision makers
are likely to act DEMO varying circumstances.
There is an extensive dual decision process literature, Hammond (1996), Over
and Jonathan St Evans (1996), Over (2003), Chaiken and Trope (1999), Forgas
(2000), Gigerenzer and Selten (2001), Gray (2004), Montague (2006). However,
I will confine my comments to dual process research that is relevant to DEMO percep-
tion and choice under uncertainty.
Most dual decision process models are based on a common set of general obser-
vations about decision making. DEMO, they emphasize that perception and sensation
are distinct and that the DEMO actively imposes meaning on sensory data. That is,
“knowledge” is a mental creation. Nevertheless, decision makers generally don’t
experience judgment as a “construction”. Second, because the world is complex,
decision makers extensively utilize categorization procedures to simplify and sort
data. Third, motives direct perception. In effect, people most often see what they
are ready to see and different people may interpret the same data differently.
Nevertheless, cultural values and norms constrain and condition alternative percep-
tions, judgments, and choices. Fourth, decision makers don’t seek absolute truth as
much as they seek to terminate DEMO by having their world appear satisfactorily
consistent. This creates tendencies to avoid ambiguity and discordant data and to
see new experiences as being similar DEMO those already incurred. Fifth, the default
decision process tends to be DEMO (based on so called rules of thumb) because
52
R.A. Olsen
it conserves effort, accelerates the decision process, and DEMO generally perceived to
yield acceptable results in a less than fully understandable and predictable world.
Decision makers may make use of more effortful and DEMO information pro-
cessing in some circumstances but when they do, heuristic DEMO usually
occurs simultaneously. Time, cognitive capacity, and felt need generally determine
whether more systematic and effortful decision-making processes are utilized.
At one end DEMO the decision process, continuum is a decision process usually
called “associative” DEMO “experiential.” The associative or experiential process gener-
ates what are experienced as intuitive and affective responses. It is reproductive
rather than productive in the DEMO that it uses cues mentally retrieved from similar
past events when processing information. The experiential system encodes infor-
mation in the form of concrete DEMO, images, and narratives. It appears to be
relatively nonsymbolic and not linguistic. For this reason, it is speculated that expe-
riential processing is evolutionarily much older than “rational” thought. In general,
experiential information processing DEMO to be holistic, context sensitive, and flex-
ible. Most importantly, DEMO processing is emotionally driven and motivated
by anticipated affect. For this reason, decision makers often feel that they are “com-
pelled” to make a decision that “feels right” as opposed to one that “looks right”.
In DEMO, there is substantial evidence that decision makers often use “rationally
derived” DEMO as a cover for their more experientially based inclinations.
At the other end of the decision process continuum is the process called “rule
based” DEMO “rational”. A defining feature of the rule-based or rational decision pro-
cess is that it uses symbolically represented knowledge in processing. Processing
rules are DEMO based and socially learned. Information is evaluated and inte-
grated using logical analysis as opposed to informal associations. The rational
processing system requires greater DEMO focus and therefore tends to be used
where greater accuracy is an important consideration. The rational system is more
effortful and time consuming. Also, it performs well only where the decision situ-
ation is relatively simple DEMO there is a unique goal or objective. Affect plays little
or no role in this decision-making process although some have suggested that affect
may DEMO conceptualized as “deliberative” and thus treated as a rational element.
The two decision processes appear to act simultaneously but with different
weights depending upon DEMO situation. Evidence of simultaneous operation is abun-
dant. It ranges from such obvious evidence as people expressing irrational fears
while at the same time DEMO aware that the fears are not realistic, to carefully con-
trolled DEMO experiments where lack of experiential input leads to poor judg-
ment even where rational processes are fully implemented.
Grossberg and Gutowski (1987), Hanoch (2002) and Reyna (2004) have devel-
oped theoretical models suggesting DEMO the two decision systems operate in tan-
dem. Grossberg calls his model “Affective Balance Theory” and he describes how
learning can instill affective influences DEMO cognitive representations. Hanoch sug-
gests that emotion influences reason in three particular ways. First, emotions
restrict the range of options considered. Second, emotions DEMO attention on spe-
cific parameters of the decision situation and third, DEMO assist in terminating
any evaluation process. Reyna calls her model “Fuzzy Trace Risk Theory”. She suggests
4

53
that risk perceptions are represented in two alternative memory forms. The first is
a more computational, abstract, and individual in form. The second is more “gist”
oriented where the gist captures the emotion of the situation and embraces the con-
DEMO that people seek by relating the risk in a particular situation to other similar
situations. She hypothesizes that gist, and thereby affect, gets DEMO greater weight in
complex decisions. In general, there seems to be DEMO agreement that greater
decision complexity leads to increased perceptions of risk and a tendency to rely on
more holistic and affective evidence.
Other risk DEMO implications of the dual process have been suggested.
Gonzach (2000) and Weber and Siebermorgen (2005) note that familiarity leads to
greater emphasis DEMO affective risk attributes. Investors perceive less risk in compa-
nies that they recognize and feel positive about. Loewenstein and Weber (2001)
also suggest that different decision attributes trigger different risk attributes. For
example, cognitive perceptions of risk are related to probabilities whereas emo-
tional or affective attributes DEMO related to outcome vividness and salience.
Brandstatter and Kubberger (2002) finds that, in general, emotion leads to the over
weighting of low DEMO and the under weighting of high probabilities.
Forlani (2002) finds that positive affect arising from feelings of control leads to
lower risk perceptions DEMO increased risk taking while, Moreno and Kida (2003)
notes that, in general, positive affect induces risk taking.
The relationship between ambiguity DEMO perceived risk has been the focus of a
number of studies by Sarin and Weber (1992), Hogarth and Kunreuther (1995),
Huber (1995), Ghosh and Ray (1997), Lauriola (2001), and Ho and Keller (2002).
They find that risk perceptions vary directly with ambiguity and that risk percep-
tions tend to increase with perceived DEMO complexity. Alhakami and Slovic
(1994), Jordan and Kass (2002) DEMO Finucane and Holup (2006) note that risk
perceptions often are inversely related to expectations of return because of affect.
Good (bad) things DEMO seen as being low (high) in risk and high (low) in return.
Eiser (2002) suggests that trust can have this effect DEMO a positive affective risk
attribute but that affective and cognitive risk dimensions appear to have indepen-
dent effects on hazard acceptance.
Perhaps the most DEMO conclusion from studies of the simultaneous opera-
tion of the two decision-making systems is that because the experiential system can
operate outside of normal DEMO, the rational system can be significantly influ-
enced because it is DEMO that there is any affective influence, Berkowitz (2000),
Frijida DEMO Manstead (2000), Erb and Bioy (2002). A rather obvious example of
this can be seen in the situation where the experiential DEMO directs attention to
more salient information and the rational system logically analyzes the information
unaware that the information selection process was biased from the DEMO
Decision makers’ ability to think “rationally” appears to increase with training.
It has been suggested that experts’ lesser perceptions of risk in their domain DEMO
expertise are a function of their greater ability to focus on statistical facts, with less
affective interference, Barke (1995). Sjoberg (2002) disputes this contention. He con-
tends that experienced decision makers are similarly DEMO by the same mix of
affective and analytical influences as nonexperts. He concludes that positive affect
54
R.A. Olsen
is the primary reason that experts rate risks as DEMO in their domains of expertise.
That is what they do as work is seen as “good,” and what is “good” is usually seen
DEMO less risky.
4.5
Risk: For Me or for Others Also?
DEMO this point, I have examined the neural underpinnings of perceived risk DEMO have
discussed the decision-making processes that would carry its influence. I have
implicitly assumed that risk perceptions would manifest attributes reflecting the
singularly selfish DEMO of the decision maker. In this section, I will briefly survey
DEMO suggesting that an individual’s risk perceptions might also contain attri-
butes that are pluralistic or group focused.
Man is a social animal and it DEMO be surprising not to find traces of sociality
in his perceptions of risk. In particular, where personal survival and the transmis-
sion of one’s genes to the next generation are partially a function of group support,DEMO
it would appear likely that perceived risk might contain “group traces”.
Research from Evolutionary Biology and Neuroscience suggests that humans
have a significant proclivity DEMO cooperate as well as compete and have evolved
neural hardware to enhance survival through “evolutionary and psychological altru-
ism,” Cashdan (1990), Pfaff (2007), Wang and Johnson (1995), Ridley (1996),
DEMO and Wilson (1998). As a consequence, humans seem to have some inborn
ability to detect social cheaters and free riders through observations DEMO facial fea-
tures, body posture, and speech patterns. There is also speculation that the naturally
occurring emotions such as anger and fear, outrage, etc. serve important roles in
encouraging social behaviors and norms that support group relationships and non-
zero sum reciprocity. Shunning, ostracism, and disdain DEMO hoarders are examples
of such derivative enforcement mechanisms. Humans also demonstrate a significant
ability to become empathetic by internally simulating the experiences of others.
DEMO humans have a strong innate predisposition to be socially influenced and to
imitate others, Dugation (2000). In this regard, “herding” and a type of “swarm
logic” become especially prevalent in complex and uncertain situations DEMO there is
brain imaging evidence to suggest that it may be partly “hardwired,” Rizzolatti and
Craighero (2004).
Game theorists also point to evidence that cooperation seems to be a natural state
Axelrod (1997), Wright (2001), Skyrms (2004). Experimental results from “pris-
oner DEMO type games indicate that in more natural settings, cooperation rather
than DEMO seems to be normal. Even more significant is the fact that in environ-
ments that contain some irreducible uncertainty, game outcomes with cooperation
are evolutionarily stable. That is, free riding and selfish behavior do not force
cooperation into extinction.
Finally, it has been argued that from an evolutionary perspective, humans
appear to have developed a feeling for a “logic of appropriate behavior,” Freeman
(1997). Based upon these considerations, it DEMO be expected that individual’s
4

risk attributes might be associated with group concepts such as fairness, trust,
equality, etc. DEMO number of studies have found elements of these concepts in risk
perceptions, Weber and Hsee (1998), Lupton (1999), Renn and Rohrnan (2000),
Nisbett (2003), Fehr and Fischbacher (2005), DEMO (2008).
At the most general level, a person’s “worldview” appears to influence risk per-
ceptions. Studies by Bouyer and Bagdassaian (2001) DEMO Slovic (1993) find that
that people with a more egalitarian or individualistic worldview tend to perceive
hazards as riskier than those with hierarchical DEMO fatalistic worldviews. Wang and
Johnson (1995), Wang and Simons (2001) note that risk perceptions are related to
the size and relatedness of the group facing a hazard. Large group size and lack of
social DEMO are associated with lower perceived risk. In a related study,
Scherer and Cho (2003) find that people with stronger social linkages have DEMO
similar perceptions of risk. Viklund (2003) finds that trust is related to perceived
risk. Where group trust is greater, people perceive risk to be lower. Siegrist and
Cvetkovich (2000) find that people trust most DEMO who share their values. Renn
(2004) and Slovic (1987, 2000) note that perceived risk is a function of other social
factors such as perceived fairness, voluntarism, effect on future generations, and
group control.
4.6
Amplification
There is a growing body of literature revealing that information DEMO hazards can
interact with psychological, social, and institutional processes in ways that can
amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk and return, Pidgeon and Kasperson (2006).
Amplification can occur at two points: in the DEMO of information and in the
response of the receiver. Amplified risk perceptions in turn lead to behavioral
responses that can have secondary impacts such DEMO requirements for new regula-
tions or financial impacts on unrelated firms. Sometimes information about a per-
ceived risk, such as the failure of Enron, has an amplified financial repercussion
that far exceeds the local impact, DEMO at other times attenuation occurs.
Attenuation of perceived risk appears to have been the case with the failure of
Long-Term Capital Management, which went almost unnoticed by most investors
yet it threatened the survival of the DEMO financial system.
In communication theory, amplification (attenuation) takes place in DEMO informa-
tion transmission stage. Each message not only has a factual content but also infer-
ential, value related, and symbolic content. These additional DEMO have
independent influences on how a message is interpreted. For example, DEMO the finan-
cial information comes from a highly respected and knowledgeable source, and
concerns an issue that is important to the investing public, DEMO impact is likely to be
more significant than otherwise. Also, if DEMO message is heard many times from a
variety of sources, or DEMO from a personal friend, the impact is likely to be greater.
DEMO, if the information is disputed, not very dramatic, or concerns DEMO mar-
ginalized group, the impact is likely to be attenuated. It DEMO especially important to
56
R.A. Olsen
note that amplification is not just due to media DEMO More important is the
degree to which one is personally perceived to be at risk and that the message comes
from a trusted source. DEMO extremely negative situations, the perception of risk can be
raised to DEMO levels that a stigma may become attached to entire classes of activities
or financial assets. This may be seen in the labeling of lower DEMO bonds as “junk
bonds” and in the negative characterization of “hedge funds” by many investors.
As just mentioned, risk amplification primarily takes place at the information
transmission stage. Because transmission depends upon the dynamics of the DEMO
mation network, it is important to be clear how the financial DEMO network
is structured (it’s topology). If it takes what is DEMO a “small world” form with
many “weak” informational ties, we would DEMO that information would travel fast
but be subject to considerable amplification.
First, a small world financial network describes a situation where there is a hub
and spoke arrangement in which many nodes (investors) are clustered DEMO
informational hubs (advisors, financial institutions) that act as opinion leaders. DEMO addi-
tion, there would be many “weak ties” (professional organizations and associa-
tions) that bring distant hubs into more frequent contact. Hubs tend to lower the
threshold of new information absorption and increase retransmission velocity.
DEMO synchronization resulting in herd mentality and groupthink are enhanced in
the small world network as a result of sequential information transmission and
positive feedback. DEMO addition, preferential attachment, wherein those hubs that
appear superior gain the most followers, exacerbates contagious behavior within
the network. Loss aversion, in DEMO form of regret avoidance, also increases the
tendency for network compaction. DEMO information amplification in the small
world network arises from positive feedback and path dependency. The significant
macro financial market result would be nonlinear price DEMO wherein informa-
tional influences would result in stock price fluctuations that were nonproportional
to the initial informational content. That is security markets would exhibit DEMO
volatility. Most standard economic models do not assume a small world network.
Alternatively, they assume random networks where information is independently
evaluated by investors. In the standard economic model, investors’ preferences are
exogenous and not influenced by the “mind of the market” as formed by network
dynamics. Network DEMO is implicitly neutral.
Second, there is structural and market behavior evidence DEMO financial information
networks are “small world networks” and subject to significant price amplification.
1. Given the complexity of the investment process, most nonprofessional investors
rely heavily upon the advice of those seen to be experts. In DEMO regard, trust in
the form of ability and integrity is given DEMO weight. Affective information is
generally given greater weight than quantitative data. Portfolio Diversification
is generally insufficient (concentration in “good prospects”), and investment
horizons are usually short, (less than 3 years). Capon (1996), Clark-Murphy
(2004), DeBondt, (1998), Waynered (2001).
2. DEMO investors are very well connected through a web of educational,
social, and business associations. This milieu tends to result in beliefs and methods
4

of analysis that are quite homogenous. They scrutinize competitors’ investment
behavior in the attempt to generate DEMO performance. The relative ease with
which funds can flow between financial institutions creates a relatively short
investment mind set. Professionals make greater use of DEMO analytical tech-
niques but affect plays a significant role due to time pressure, informational com-
plexity, and few if any audited “fool proof” DEMO/management techniques.
Abolafia (1996), Fenton-O’Creevy (2005), Cetina (2005), Smith (1999).
3. Empirical market data reveal that asset returns DEMO to follow power laws indicating
lack of randomness and conformity with small world network dynamics. Asset
returns also exhibit excess volatility that is consistent DEMO market over reaction,
herding, and momentum investing arising from amplification. DEMO (2000),
Shiller (1989).
4. Survey data indicate that DEMO investors herd, momentum invest, over
extrapolate trends, exhibit wishful thinking, and over estimate the return/risk
ratio for investments believed to be DEMO from an affective vantage point. In addi-
tion, they tend to DEMO overconfident and give less weight to disconfirming evi-
dence. Cooper (2005), Dennis (2002), Karceski (2002), Sias (2004).
In DEMO, it is most likely that information amplification will influence invest-
ment DEMO Because there appears to be an inverse affective relationship
between perceived risk and expected returns in the minds of many investors and
because affect DEMO a significant influence in asset valuation, it is likely that positive
DEMO information will result in upwardly amplified market valuations.
Expected return will be biased upward while risk will be biased downward. Negative
information should have DEMO reverse effect. However, the amplification of negative
information is subject to DEMO complicating influences. Loss averse investors usually
react more strongly to identified negative information but investors often underesti-
mate the potential of negative information because DEMO “desirability bias” (positive
outcomes are seen as more likely than negative DEMO), Olsen (1997a).
4.7
Implications and Evidence
By now, it may appear that the variable called “perceived financial risk” might pres-
ent DEMO modelers with an iconoclastic nightmare. However, there are a few
identifiable DEMO general implications. This section will identify those
important themes and briefly identify some of the more representative supporting
research.
First and foremost, perceptions of financial risk are dominated by fear of loss.
Although variability in potential DEMO is also sometimes mentioned as a risk attri-
bute, more detailed DEMO reveals that people are not especially troubled by
unexpected gains but instead by the low side of the return distribution. Rode and
Wang (2000) present theory and evidence suggesting that this predisposition is an
evolutionary adaptation. In fact, animal studies identify loss aversion as a “common
58
R.A. Olsen
denominator” underlying animal foraging behavior and investment selection, Olsen
(2008). The desire to avoid loss is also indicated in the tendency to prefer outcome
distributions with positive skew and an extreme dislike DEMO return distributions
exhibiting the potential for very large losses, even where DEMO chance of the loss is
very low.
Loss can be manifested in different ways. Sometimes loss is perceived in abso-
lute terms, such as in dollars lost or a particular low percentage return. At other
times, it is expressed in qualitative terms, such as a future opportunity that would
have to be forgone. On other occasions, it is perceived in relative terms whereby the
loss is expressed as that of falling below DEMO desired target or aspiration level.
Finally, it might be expressed as DEMO fear of experiencing future regret, as in making
a choice that DEMO an outcome that would be disappointing or embarrassing,
Landman (1993)DEMO Much has been made of the observation that in some experimen-
tal situations described as “loss situations” investors tend to act as “risk takers”.
DEMO is, they prefer the more risky gamble that might put them DEMO deeper into a
financial hole if a positive alternative does not materialize. Examination of this
behavior in “real world” settings suggests that the decision DEMO is still attempting
to avoid a loss. He/she is usually trying to avoid an existing bad situation but one
that has not as DEMO yielded the “final blow”. Thus, the risk-taking behavior actually
represents a DEMO ditch effort to avoid the impending calamity, which is not per-
DEMO as being made significantly worse by any additional negative results. When
one has his/her “back to the wall,” behavior that would be DEMO in more
normal situations is often quite rational. For example, military DEMO, firefighting,
and even important athletic contests are rife with such DEMO
Some of the earlier studies of importance with regard to the avoidance of loss
are those by Alderfer and Bierman (1970) Gooding (1976),Cooley(1977), Laughunn
and Payne (1980). Later studies include DEMO of Solt (1989), Harlow and Rao
(1989), Unser (DEMO), Ippolito (1992), March and Shapira (1992), Holtgrave and
Weber (1993), Shapira (1995), Olsen (1997a), Williman and O’Creevy (2002),
Kermer and Driver-Linn (2006).
The second major implication of risk perception studies is that most investors’
risk perceptions simultaneously DEMO affective and cognitive elements. By affec-
tive elements, I mean risk DEMO that reflect the investor’s feelings of goodness
or badness toward an investment. These feelings can be nonconscious or conscious.
In general, good (bad) feeling leads to perceptions of lower (greater) risk. This
affective influence DEMO also give rise to a negative, as opposed to a positive DEMO
cal correlation between perceived risk and expected return. Usually, affect has DEMO
most significance where the decision situation is complex and effortful, information
DEMO perceived to be incomplete or unreliable, the decision maker feels less DEMO,
is female, and the time for evaluation is short. Cognitive DEMO attributes, such as
statistics, tend to be more commonly used by experts and those who have been
trained to think in more abstract DEMO However, it is not the case that experts are
uninfluenced by DEMO considerations.
Finally, it is important to note that current financial theory DEMO the
importance of correlation for risk control in a portfolio context. That is investors
4

59
should diversify by investing in assets that have returns that are less than perfectly
positively correlated. DEMO, studies of nonprofessional investors indicate
that people do not follow this DEMO, Benartzi and Thaler (1995), Fisher and Meir
(1997). DEMO reasons appear to be twofold. First, humans do not well understand DEMO
formal concept of covariance in nonnatural and abstract circumstances. Humans do
not appear to recognize covariance unless it occurs in very repetitive and concrete
DEMO Second, humans tend to mentally compartmentalize decisions by
goal and context. DEMO, when they formulate an investment plan, they do not visual-
ize the task as a whole but instead see a need to make DEMO investments for
retirement, the children’s education, etc. Therefore, the risk DEMO of the individual’s
portfolio becomes a random byproduct instead of a managed attribute, Shefrin
(2000). “Total perceived risk” is not a naturally DEMO concept because it
entails multiple goals, timelines, and information types.
It is interesting to consider how affective risk attributes might offer the most
DEMO explanation of many of the risk/return anomalies that have arisen
from tests of current financial theories,(the CAPM in particular). Take for instance
the observation that firm size and the ratio of book value DEMO market value appear to
be risk proxies, Fama and French (1993), Fama and French (1996), Jensen and
Johnson (1997). DEMO specifically, common stocks of small firms and those with
high book DEMO market values appear to yield excessively high ex post returns, after
DEMO (Beta) risk adjustments. There is evidence that small firms yield higher
compensatory equilibrium returns because they are associated with increased nega-
tive affect DEMO to difficulty of evaluation, Olsen and Troughton (2000). Assuming
risk aversion, these more negatively perceived firms require a higher compensatory
risk premium resulting in a lower market value. Thus, these more negatively
affected firms, with their higher BV/MV, yield higher conventionally risk-adjusted
ex post DEMO
The observation that investors are subject to “home bias,” a predilection for the
stocks of “local” companies, has been widely noted, Huberman (2001), Grinblatt
and Keloharju (2001). Again, positive affect may DEMO a reason for this behavior.
Affect research shows that decision makers see as more positive, and hence less
risky, those financial assets that DEMO more familiar, Gonzach (2000), Weber and
Siebermorgen (2005), DEMO (Cao et al. 2008). Thus, even if the “home firm” is cog-
nitively seen as identical to a nonhome equivalent, the home firm is likely to be
favored because of the positive sentiment associated DEMO familiarity.
There are many other anomalies that may result from affective influence, Thaler
(2005) Shefrin (2000). Herding and over reaction are DEMO related to the observed
positive affect and lower perceived risk associated with crowd following and group
membership, Wang and Johnson (1995), Wang DEMO Simons (2001); Scherer and
Cho (2003). Likewise, the DEMO effect is likely associated with the negative
affect associated with the formal acknowledgment of loss, Landman (1993).
Similarly, large IPO premiums quite probably are affect related. As an example,
expectations of gain may DEMO an amplified influence on stock prices due to
the affectively induced inverse ex ante relationship between expected gain and
perceived risk.
60 R.A. Olsen
Most of the studies that have investigated perceived financial DEMO from both
affective and cognitive perspectives are of more recent origin. Much of this
research has not received extensive publicity because of the traditional DEMO
emphasis on statistical risk metrics. Nevertheless, important affective/cognitive
financial risk DEMO research involving experts and novices, and utilizing
many different research designs DEMO be found in Farrelly and Reichenstein
(1984) MacCrimmon and Wehrung (DEMO), Harlow and Brown (1990),
Goszcznyska (1991), Shapira (1995), Jungerman (1997), Lopes (1997), Olsen
(1997b), Olsen and Troughton (2000), Olsen (2001, 2002, 2004, 2008),
Jianakoplous and Bernasek (1998), Macgregor and Slovic (1999), Williams
and Voon (1999), Gonzach (2000), Diacon and Ennew (2001), Bohner and
Zeckhauser (2004), Dunn (2005), Koonce DEMO Gascho (2005), Weber and
Siebermorgen (2005).
The third important implication of risk perception research is that risk percep-
tions can be DEMO by cultural and group factors. That is investors’ perceptions
of what is risky involves cultural values as well as considerations of the distribution
of DEMO among group members. In this regard, studies by Renn and Rohrnan (2000),
Slovic (1993) find risk attributes, such as fairness, voluntarism, effect on future
generations, are important. Bouyer and Bagdassaian (2001) and Peters and Slovic
(1996) find world views to be important. Those who see the world from a more
egalitarian or individualistic perspective DEMO hazards as posing greater risks than
those who believe in a more hierarchical society or whom are more fatalistic. Wang
and Johnson (1995), Wang and Simons (2001) find that risks are perceived as
greater DEMO small close-knit groups while Scherer and Cho (2003) find that indi-
vidual risk perceptions tend to become more similar as group interaction increases.
DEMO (2003) notes that Asians are more likely to perceive risk in a more affective
fashion, be less overconfident in belief, less inclined DEMO believe in continuity of
returns over time, and more likely to DEMO group convention than Westerners.
Finally, Viklund (2003) and Olsen (2008) note a strong inverse relationship between
personal trust and perceived risk. Siegrist and Earle (2003) note that as decisions
become more complex, trust appears to become the preferred affective substitute
for risk estimated in a DEMO probabilistic fashion.
Johnson and Grayson (2005) note that investors’ trust in their financial advisors
appears to be influenced by both cognitive and affective DEMO “Cognitive
trust” is based upon perceptions of competence and reliability whereas “Affective
trust” is based upon care, concern, and familiarity.
4.8 Entrepreneurs: Confirmation About the Risk Perception
Process
Most discussions of entrepreneurial behavior are heavily DEMO toward the subject
of risk because the activity is viewed as involving a willing acceptance of greater
financial uncertainty. Earlier literature suggested that entrepreneurs DEMO a high
4

personal tolerance for risk that accounted for their risk proclivity. More recent
research has shown that DEMO tolerance has little explanatory value. Instead, it
appears that the nature DEMO entrepreneurial activity causes budding entrepreneurs to
select and weigh information in such a way that risk perceptions are very often “low
side biased,” DEMO (2003).
The entrepreneurial milieu skews the decision process toward the DEMO of more
affective decision rules that result in more favorably perceived risk/return opportu-
nities. A critical element in this process is the affective DEMO to equate oppor-
tunities with high expected return with lower levels of risk, Alhakami and Slovic
(1994), Jordan and Kass (2002), Finucane and Holup (2006). In addition, there is
evidence that DEMO tend to give greater weight to expected outcomes as
opposed to prospective risk in investment decisions because of the affective influ-
ence of time DEMO, incomplete information, and ambiguity, Baron (1998),
Palich and DEMO Bagby (1995). Additional research has suggested that cognitive
errors associated DEMO overconfidence, feelings of control, and a belief in the “law
of small numbers” further exacerbate the downward affective risk bias, Mitchell
and Busenitz (2002), Simon and Houghton (1999). In entrepreneurial environ-
ments, we see the full influence of the dual decision process and how DEMO can lead to
biased risk perceptions. Entrepreneurs do not appear to have significantly higher
risk tolerance; they just judge the perceived risks to be less threatening.
4.9
Conclusion
In an earlier chapter, I discussed how neoclassical finance has become descriptively
hobbled and normatively suspect by adopting assumptions that DEMO now scientifi-
cally untenable, Olsen (2001). Neoclassical Finance incorrectly assumed that
humans were, or at least could become, axiomatically rational optimizers, as
implied by the now outdated psychology of behaviorism. Second, it assumed a
deterministic reality that could be fully deciphered through reductionism; an
assumption that has also been overturned by complexity theory and quantum theory.
Until DEMO, with the reawakened interest in behavioral economics and the new
“behavioral DEMO,” finance appears not to have sought the necessary nourishment
from its social science roots while constructing elegant but fragile mathematical
edifices.
The quantification DEMO risk is operationally convenient and necessary for
developing theories of market behavior. However, inattention to the more
complex affective side of risk perception is now limiting a more profound under-
standing of risk-driven investment behavior. Individual DEMO, industry, and
government are constantly looking for better ways to measure, communicate, and
contend with financial risk. Normative processes leading to better DEMO
results cannot be developed and enacted without understanding the psychology and
limits of the investing mind. Hopefully, this chapter will stimulate further research
along these lines.
