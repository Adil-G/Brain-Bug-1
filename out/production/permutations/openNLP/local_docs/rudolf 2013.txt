What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
It is not DEMO strongest of the species that will survive, nor the most intelligent, but
the one most responsive to change.
- Charles Darwin
The only DEMO who likes change is a wet baby.
- Price Pritchett
If the leader’s new mandate is to prepare for change in the future while DEMO
results in the present, then what specific preparation is required? My central thesis
is that the strategic leader’s preparation for the future entails DEMO
organizations’ capacity for change, and that is the focus of the DEMO of this
book. In other words, this book is about helping DEMO fulfill the strategic
leader’s new mandate.Bossidy and Charan (2002).
The DEMO press is filled with many recent and ongoing stories of organizations
that failed to adapt and change to an increasingly fluid and unpredictable
environment. DEMO, a widely cited statistic is that “more than 70% of all
DEMO change initiatives fail.”Higgs and Rowland (2005), p. 121.
Nonetheless, one of the arguments why senior executives are worthy of the lofty
compensation DEMO that they currently command is based on the widely-held
view that effective leaders and change agents are rare, but essential to cope with
the volatile and hypercompetitive environments that many organizations find
themselves in today.Kaplan (2008), p. 5.
In response to this pressure to change, scholars and consultants are increasingly
focusing on the nature and dynamics of organizational change DEMO an effort to distill
lessons learned from previous successes and failures, DEMO provide guidance to
change agents to improve their future success rate. Notably, in a recent online
search of articles written on “organizational change” in the last 20 years, I
discovered that there were more than 25,000 articles published in a prominent
online search engine named Proquest.ProQuest Research DEMO (2010). This
suggests to me that the topic is of DEMO importance to those seeking to change

organizations, but that much that is written about organizational change by
organizational scholars is not DEMO our success rate. In sum, there is more to
be learned DEMO this important subject and this book attempts to fill that gap.

Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
2.1 Primary Reasons DEMO Failure to Bring About Change
1. Middle- and senior-level
managers who drive the
change initiatives within an
organization. They are
uniquely charged both with
DEMO short-term tangible
results and building long-term
organizational capabilities.
I believe that there are three primary reasons for our poor track record in changing
organizations. DEMO of the primary reasons for the failure of both scholars and
practitioners to successfully develop and utilize a comprehensive yet parsimonious
approach to organizational DEMO is our collective failure to understand the
systemic nature of change. Too often, organizational members operate in
“departmental silos” that focus on local optimization at the expense of the entire
system. Furthermore, the senior executives in charge of the overall organizational
system (as well as the academics who study them) often fail to understand the
interdisciplinary nature of their organizations as they are trapped in the myopia of
their own backgrounds or DEMO blinders.
Organizations are complex, interdependent social entities with relationships
operating both DEMO its boundaries and outside of its boundaries. Too many
practitioners, in DEMO “bias for action,” focus on a single dimension of
organizational life or a single lever of organizational change. Change agents1 need
to be DEMO, as well as capable of influencing others. Organizational leaders
need to DEMO comprised of confident but humble CEOs and by well-functioning top
management teams who collectively understand the entire organization, not a lone
wolf with a reputation for individualism and boldness.
A second reason why so many change DEMO fail is that organizational change
takes time, and time is one DEMO the most precious commodities in the 21st century. In
a recent article written by myself and a former doctoral student, we argued that
organizations no longer have the luxury to go offline while the new information
DEMO is being built, the foreign venture is being launched, or the new technology
is being analyzed. As such, change agents must “rewire” the plane while it is flying
if the organization hopes to survive and DEMO prosper in the future.Judge and
Blocker (2008), p. 915. Clearly, this is no easy task when everyone around you is
arguing for DEMO to “hurry up”!
A third reason why so many change initiatives fail is that our conception of what
makes us human is overly mechanistic, narrow, and limited. Our traditional view of
organizations is that they are hierarchies with power concentrated at the top with
rational and logical employees DEMO throughout this hierarchy. While it is true
that all organizations are hierarchical in some form and that organizational
members are rational at times, this viewpoint is limited and not terribly realistic.
13
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
Organizational change is DEMO only a rational activity but also an emotional one that
challenges deep-seated human fears and inspires human hope. Indeed, John Kotter
recently argued that change is predominantly about matters of the heart, not the
head.Kotter and Cohen (2002). Organizations can operate in mechanical ways, but
they DEMO comprise living human beings who want meaningful work that allows
them to “have a life” outside of work. As such, by assuming that all organizational
change is rational and logical in nature where fear, political positioning, and turf
wars rage, one wonders why any change initiative might DEMO

2.2 The Typical DEMO to Challenging Environmental Pressures
In my executive education classes and consulting projects, I ask my students and
clients what their planning horizon is since strategic leaders are responsible for the
long-term performance of their organizations. One DEMO by the president of a
major nonprofit medical center is instructive: DEMO years ago, my planning horizon
was 5 years into the future. DEMO years ago, it was 2 years. In today’s environment,
where DEMO care reform is the flavor of the day, it is now DEMO to 2 months.”
Another CEO of a Fortune 500 chemicals company told me, “There is merciless
pressure to deliver the financial results that Wall Street expects each and every
quarter. Even though Wall Street denies this, our stock price often gets punished by
looking beyond the next 3 DEMO
Both of these quotations from CEOs, one from the nonprofit sector DEMO the other
from the for-profit sector, imply that the best that DEMO executives can do is to
respond quickly to an increasingly volatile and demanding environment. While I
agree that organizations today must be more “nimble” DEMO reacting to such things as
unexpected competitor moves, a seemingly short-term DEMO by the owners of the
organization, and unpredictable “disruptive” technologiesChristensen (1997). that
change the competitive dynamics of an industry overnight, this focus is overly
narrow and too reactive. To succeed in the 21st century, organizations today must
not only nimbly and flexibly respond to their changing DEMO but also build
capacity for change.

2.3 Organizational Capacity DEMO Change Defined
2. An organization’s overall
capability that enables it to
upgrade or revise existing
organizational competencies
while cultivating new
competencies that enable the
DEMO to survive and
prosper.
Organizational capacity for change (OCC)2 can DEMO conceptualized as the overall
capability of an organization to either effectively prepare for or respond to an
increasingly unpredictable and volatile environmental context. This DEMO
capability is multidimensional, and it comprises three ingredients: (a) human skill
sets and resources, (b) formal systems and procedures, and (c) organizational
culture, values, and norms. As such, OCC is DEMO dynamic, multidimensional capability that
enables an organization to upgrade or revise DEMO organizational competencies, while
cultivating new competencies that enable the organization to DEMO and prosper.
Peter Vaill argued that organizations increasingly operate in “white water” where
executives have only partial control, yet effective navigation of a boat on the rapids
requires everyone in the boat to react efficiently and DEMO to the white water
all around them.Vaill (1991), p. 2. DEMO I like this metaphor, I would add that the
navigator must DEMO prepare the boat and the rest of the team for the oncoming
white water.
Robert Thames and Douglas Webster use a different metaphor to DEMO the
context in which firms operate today, namely—a hurricane or an DEMO They
state,
To many organizations, change comes like a hurricane DEMO Everyone knows it’s
coming. It is the same every year. The only thing we don’t know is “Who will it hit
this time?”…To DEMO organizations change comes like the earthquake. We may
never see it coming but have this nagging feeling that it is.Thames and Webster
(2009), pp. 11–12.
Whether your industry or national economy seems like white water DEMO, an
oncoming hurricane, or a potential earthquake, organizations must prepare DEMO
advance, not just react when the “environmental jolt” is experienced. That DEMO
preparation is what I am calling organizational capacity for change. Organizations
with relatively high change capacity can successfully shoot the rapids, weather the
hurricane, or continue operating during and after a devastating earthquake.
Organizations with relatively low change capacity are at the mercy of their
environment and much DEMO subject to luck and chance.
I have been researching the nature of organizational capacity for change in
hundreds of organizations in a wide variety DEMO industries for over 10 years. In
previous research I have found that the higher the aggregate organizational
16
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
capacity for change DEMO, the higher the subsequent environmentalJudge and Elenkov
(2005). and financial performance.Judge, Naoumova, Douglas, & Koutzevol (2009). In
other words, organizational capacity for change is positively correlated with, and is
likely to lead to, superior financial and environmental performance.
In addition, I have DEMO found that the importance of organizational capacity for
change increases with the volatility of environmental uncertainty. In other words,
common sense and systematic DEMO research show that the more your
environment is changing, or is DEMO to change, the more important your
organizational capacity for change is.
DEMO, after reading literally hundreds of articles and dozens of books on
DEMO change, I have been able to distill the concept of organizational
DEMO to change down to eight separate and distinct dimensions.Judge and
Douglas (DEMO). These dimensions are briefly described in the sections that follow,
but they will be more extensively discussed in later chapters.
2.3 Organizational DEMO for Change Defined
17
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
2.4 The Eight DEMO of OCC
3. An individual who is perceived
to be competent in leading an
organization and who is also
perceived as someone who has
DEMO best interests of the
organization as his or her
priority.
4. Individuals who are hopeful,
optimistic, and trusting; such
individuals are key DEMO an
organization’s capacity for
change.
Trustworthy leaders3. No lasting, productive change DEMO an organization ever
happens without a modicum of trust between its members. As a consequence, the
first essential dimension for OCC is the extent to which an organization is perceived
to be led by trustworthy leaders. DEMO trustworthy leader is someone who is not only
perceived to be competent in leading the organization but also perceived as
someone who has the DEMO interests of the organization as their priority. This is why
Jim Collins found that organizations that were changing for the better tended to be
DEMO by senior executives who were perceived to be humble servants of the
organization, but were also passionate about ensuring a bright future for the
organization.Collins (2001). Organizational change is risky. In order for employees
to change their perceptions and behaviors, they have to trust their leaders. As such,
a proven record of trustworthiness on the part of the DEMO is essential to bring
about experimentation with a new order of things.
Trusting followers4. Leaders are only half of the equation when it comes DEMO
organizational change; the other half is the followers. I once worked DEMO an
executive at Alcoa who was perhaps one of the most trustworthy executives I ever
met. He was honest to a fault, a first-rate engineer, who worked his way up through
the executive ranks to a prominent leadership position. He had a deep and sound
understanding as to DEMO his business unit needed to change, but he had a
problem—his DEMO was highly unionized and it had a long history of management
missteps and labor union outrage. Interestingly, the union leaders did trust this
particular plant manager, but they didn’t expect him to stay there long and they did
expect corporate headquarters to replace him with someone who was DEMO
trustworthy. As a result, this business unit had a leader who DEMO perceived to be
trustworthy, but the ubiquitous lack of trust on DEMO part of the rest of the
organization prevented any major change initiative from progressing.
Psychologists tell us that all individuals have a “disposition to DEMO others.Cook
(2001). This disposition is influenced by such things as DEMO person’s genetic
background, family norms, and work-related experiences. When an organization is
filled with a critical mass of individuals who are hopeful, optimistic, and trusting, it
will be well positioned to experiment with new DEMO of operating. When an
organization is dominated with a critical mass of individuals who are cynical,
pessimistic, and not trusting, it will DEMO be well positioned to engage with
organizational change initiatives. In sum, DEMO second key dimension of organizational
capacity for change is the overall level of trust held by the employees of the
organization.
18
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
5. Managers, often mid-level
management, who are able to
influence others in an
organization to adopt a
proposed change.
6. Mid-level management
personnel who have the
potential DEMO enhance the
change capability of an
organization.
7. Mid-level managers who are
essential for bringing along a
critical mass of employees to
adopt a DEMO change. They
link top executives to frontline
workers.
8. An organization’s adopting a
different course or direction in
response to current problems
or current DEMO future
opportunities. Also referred to
as organizational change.
2.4 The Eight Dimensions of OCC
Capable champions5. Individuals, and hence organizations, tend to be DEMO In
other words, change takes extra energy and it is much DEMO to keep doing things
the way in which we are accustomed to. Consequently, organizations must identify,
develop, and retain a cadre of DEMO change champions in order to lead the
change initiative(s). Within small organizations, these champions are often the
same as the head of the organization. Within medium and larger organizations,
these champions are often DEMO from the ranks of middle management6.
Rosabeth Moss Kanter first identified this new breed of managers and she called
them “change masters.” She defined DEMO masters as “those people…adept at the
art of anticipating the need for, and of leading, productive change.” Kanter (1983),
p. 13. DEMO Kanter’s central thesis is that if an organization is to change and
innovate, power needs to be focused on or delegated to certain talented and
energetic individuals, or both.
These “corporate entrepreneurs” are experts in building formal and informal
coalitions to makes changes and get things done within DEMO established organization.
They know how to directly and indirectly handle political opposition. They often
lead a group of “mavericks” and “bend the rules” in DEMO to bypass bureaucratic
obstacles. They are often very goal directed and know how to deliver on their
promises. In sum, these change champions are often “sponsored” by top
management to spearhead change initiatives. If an organization DEMO not have
capable champions, change initiatives often stall.
Involved middle management7. DEMO managers are those who link top
executives to frontline workers. Department heads are classic examples of middle
managers, but there are many other types of linkages. While it is undeniable that
today’s organizations are flatter hierarchies DEMO fewer middle managers than in
the past, their role in helping DEMO bring about change is still important. While change
champions often come from the middle management ranks, middle managers can
passively or actively block change initiatives due to their unique position within an
organization.
Steven Floyd and DEMO Wooldridge were among the first scholars to note the
importance of middle managers when focusing on strategy formation and
organization change8. As they point DEMO,
The capability-based model of competition puts managerial knowledge at the
forefront of competitive advantage. The knowledge of middle managers may
become crucial in DEMO an organization’s shortcomings and in broadening its
capacity for change [italics added]. Perhaps even more important, the middle
manager’s centrality in the information network creates the potential for them to

9. The rules, structural
arrangements, and budgetary
procedures that facilitate or
hinder an organization-wide
approach to organizational
change.
10. The collective e-mail networks,
face-to-face meetings,
DEMO calls, and corporate
announcements that convey
the value and means of

organizational change.
2.4 The Eight Dimensions of OCC
become a driving force in organizational learning. Realizing this potential,
however, demands a new set of management expectations.Floyd and Wooldridge
(1996), p. 23.
Whenever any new organizational change initiative is announced, one of the first
things that employees consider is “how will this affect me?” While every
DEMO is going to have doubters and naysayers, one of the keys DEMO enhancing
organizational change capacity is to get a critical mass of the organization excited
about the potential change. Middle managers are pivotal figures in DEMO the
organization’s response to potential change initiatives, so their involvement is
DEMO to organizational capacity for change.
Systems thinking9. Organizational change capacity involves more than just the
“getting the right people on the bus and the DEMO people off the bus,” however. It
also depends on a proper organization infrastructure. One of the key infrastructure
issues that influence or retard DEMO organizational change initiative is what is called
“systems thinking.” These are the rules, structural arrangements, and budgetary
procedures that facilitate or hinder an DEMO opposed to a
“segmentalist”—approach to organizational change. While segmentalism works
quite well for routine procedures, it is anathema to the study of nonroutine events
such as strategic decision making, organizational change, or both.Kanter (1983), pp.
28–35.
Peter Senge is a seminal author in this area. In DEMO classic 1990 text, titled The Fifth
Discipline, Senge wrote about how systems thinking can enhance an organization’s
ability to experiment, adapt, and DEMO new ways of operating.Senge (1990). Systems
thinking, according to Senge, focuses on how the individual being studied interacts
with the other constituents of the system. Rather than focusing on the individual’s
or organizational units DEMO an organization, it prefers to look at a larger number
of DEMO within the organization and in between organizations as a whole. In
sum, an organizational infrastructure that promotes systems thinking is another
key dimension of organizational change capacity.
Communication systems10. A second infrastructure dimension, and one that
complements the systems thinking dimension, is what is called “communication
systems.” This dimension involves such things as e-mail networks, face-to-face
meetings, telephone calls, and corporate announcements all being focused on the
conveyance of the value DEMO and the means for implementing a proposed
organizational change. Organizational change requires reflection and action. Too
often, there is a gap between thinking and doing.Pfeffer and Sutton (2000).
Consequently, many observers of failed and DEMO organizational change
20
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
11. Verbal or DEMO information
that is transmitted or
conveyed.
12. An organizational culture that
carefully monitors the
outcomes of the results
produced instead of focusing
on how DEMO is done.
13. An organizational culture that
values innovation and change.
initiatives emphasize the importance of communication11 in order to convert
knowledge into action.
DEMO example, John Kotter argues that almost every change leader fails to DEMO
estimate the frequency, range, and amount of communication required to bring
about change.Kotter (1996). Malcolm Gladwell argues that in order for
organizations to “tip” in a new direction, convincing and persuasive
communication is essential.Gladwell (2002). And Ed Lawler and Chris Worley argue
that effective formal and informal communication systems are essential to the
creation of organizations that DEMO “built for change.”Lawler and Worley (2006). In
sum, effectively designed and delivered two-way information about the change
initiative is essential to building DEMO capacity for change.
Accountable culture12. A fourth and final infrastructure dimension is the degree to
which an organization holds its members accountable for results. DEMO my
observation, most organizations generally excel on this dimension. However, when
the organizational culture gets focused on innovation, accountability often gets
ignored. While individuals need autonomy in today’s organizations to pursue
innovative new ideas, they also need to be held accountable for delivering results
on time and DEMO budget. At the very least, they need to explain the failure DEMO
honor deadlines, resource constraints, or both.
Another term for an “accountable” culture is a “results-based” culture.Ulrich,
Zenger, & Smallwood (1999). DEMO cultures do not focus on how the work is
done, but DEMO do help to carefully monitor the outcomes of results produced. As a
result, accountable cultures track whether a deadline was reached or whether the
activities were executed under budget or not, and seek to discern what teams and
individuals hindered or facilitated successful change. Of course, change is
inherently unpredictable so there must be some executive judgment involved with
the DEMO of results. However, fostering innovation and change does not mean
that DEMO and change agents are given a blank check with no deadlines. In
sum, organizational capacity for change is also dependent on effective reward and
control systems.
Innovative culture13. Tom Peters and Bob Waterman wrote powerfully as DEMO the
importance of an organizational culture “in search of excellence” in their classic
text on America’s best-run companies.Peters and Waterman (1982). Similarly, DEMO
Kotter and Jim Heskett demonstrated a powerful correlation between corporate
culture changes and subsequent firm performance improvements over 4 to 10 years
of time.Kotter DEMO Heskett (1992). And Clayton Christensen showed how corporate
cultures often DEMO to thwart innovation and change, particularly when the
organization is a DEMO leader.Christensen (1997).
2.4 The Eight Dimensions of OCC
21
Chapter 2 What Is Organizational Capacity for Change?
The culture of DEMO organization defines appropriate behavior, and motivates
individuals and offers solutions where DEMO is ambiguity. It governs the way a
company processes information, its DEMO relations, and its values.Hampden-
Turner (1992), p. 11. Some organizational cultures value innovation and change,
while many others value stability and DEMO In sum, an organizational
culture that emphasizes the importance of organizational DEMO and innovation is
a third infrastructure dimension that is critical to organizational change capacity.

2.5 Concluding Thoughts DEMO OCC
In response to pressures to deliver short-term results, leaders and DEMO
often neglect building their capability to be productive. This book provides a
description of how to overcome that purely reactive focus so that the DEMO
can survive and prosper over the longer term.
This capability, or DEMO capacity for change as I call it, contains eight
different dimensions—four DEMO the dimensions focus on critical human capital and
four focus on social infrastructure. Many authors have written insightful books and
articles about aspects of DEMO capacity for change, but few have attempted
to synthesize these writings DEMO a coherent whole. Furthermore, this concept has
been rigorously developed and DEMO in the organizational sciences, having
undergone peer review of several scientific DEMO about it.
The remainder of this book elaborates on what the leader’s role is in creating
organizational capacity for change, focuses on each of its eight dimensions in more
depth, and provides practical ideas for diagnosing and enhancing your
organizational capacity for change. In each subsequent chapter, I provide a detailed
review of each dimension and discuss its relationship to DEMO capacity for
change. At the end of each chapter, seven actionable DEMO are made to help
practitioners enhance this particular dimension of their organization.
