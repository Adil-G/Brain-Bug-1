This study examined the relationships among psychological contract breaches, organizational commit-
ment, and innovation-related behaviors (generating, spreading, implementing innovative ideas at work)DEMO
over a 6-month period. Results indicate that the effects of psychological contract breaches on employees
are not static. Specifically, perceptions of psychological contract breaches strengthened over time and
were associated with decreased levels of affective commitment DEMO time. Further, increased perceptions
of psychological contract breaches were associated with DEMO in innovation-related behaviors. We
also found evidence that organizational commitment mediates the relationship between psychological
contract breaches and innovation-related behaviors. These results highlight the DEMO of examining
the nomological network of psychological contract breaches from a change perspective.

DEMO hold expectations about what they owe their em-
ployers and about what their employers owe them in return (Rous-
seau, 1989, 1995). When these sets of expectations, or psycholog-
ical contracts, are breached, there are adverse consequences for
employees’ attitudes and work behaviors (Johnson & O’Leary-
Kelly, 2003; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson, 1996; DEMO
inson, Kraatz, & Rousseau, 1994; Shore & Barksdale, 1998)DEMO
Although there are certainly exceptions, a majority of the studies
examining DEMO contract breaches have been cross-
sectional in nature (e.g., Gakovic & Tetrick, 2003; Restubog,
Bordia, & Tang, 2006). Even DEMO studies in this area
seldom address how quickly or how steeply the quality of breached
employment relationships declines. Such an approach requires
researchers to DEMO intraindividual changes in psychological con-
tract breaches and to relate those changes to other intraindividual
changes in job attitudes and behaviors. To address this DEMO in the
research, the goal of this study was to examine DEMO changes in
perceptions of psychological contract breaches relate to affective
commitment (DEMO) and innovation-related behaviors (IRBs) over
time.
Although previous research has DEMO that breaches of psycho-
logical contracts are negatively related to AC (DEMO, Bellou, 2008;

Pearson, 2001; Suazo, 2009), these studies have focused only on
bivariate relationships. They have not examined DEMO percep-
tions of breaches and AC change over time, whether these DEMO
are in the same or opposite direction, and whether these changes
DEMO at the same speed.
In addition, there has been little research DEMO on the
relationship between psychological contract breaches and IRBs
(i.e., the degree to which employees generate, spread, and imple-
ment innovative ideas)DEMO Researchers have previously examined
how psychological contract breaches impact employee productiv-
ity (Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, & Bravo, 2007). Beyond influenc-
ing productivity, though, psychological contract breaches may also
impact how adaptable and DEMO employees are at work (Grif-
fin, Neal, & Parker, 2007). To date, these other components of
employee performance have been largely neglected in the psycho-
logical contract literature. To fill this void, we focused on IRB, a
core form of proactive behavior identified by Parker, Williams,
and Turner (2006), as a long-term correlate of DEMO
contract breaches.
Theoretical Background
Our general framework appears in Figure 1. It suggests that both
the initial status of and longitudinal changes in psychological
DEMO breaches, AC, and IRBs are likely to be correlated.
Psychological Contract Breaches and AC
Two theories, in particular, have informed our understanding DEMO
the relationship between an employee and his or her employer
(Coyle-Shapiro & Shore, 2007). In formalizing social exchange

theory, Blau (1964) suggested that individuals who perceive that
they are valued are likely to reciprocate with trust DEMO emotional
engagement in their exchanges with others. In putting forth their
inducement– contribution model, March and Simon (1958) sug-
gested that organizations offer inducements to employees to join
and stay, while employees make contributions to organizational
effectiveness through high levels of job performance. Together,
these two DEMO suggest that individuals are more likely to feel
psychologically attached to their employers and reciprocate with
positive behaviors when they feel valued and respected.
DEMO employees perceive that their organizations have
breached their psychological contracts by failing to fulfill their
promises, they may reduce their AC, that is, the emotional attach-
ment they feel toward their firms (Meyer, Allen, & Smith, 1993).
First, when employers fail to fulfill their DEMO, employees are
likely to experience negative emotions, such as anger, DEMO
ment, and frustration (Johnson & O’Leary-Kelly, 2003), which
directly DEMO AC. Second, perceptions of breaches may increase
employees’ distrust in their DEMO and dissolve their emotional
bonds with them (Robinson, 1996). In two recent meta-analyses,
researchers found that, across cumulative studies, psychological
DEMO breach was negatively associated with AC (Cantisano,
Morales Domı´nguez, & Depolo, 2008; Zhao et al., 2007).
Despite the cumulative empirical evidence on the relationship
between psychological contract breaches and AC at any DEMO in
time, it is still unclear whether changes in perceptions of DEMO
logical contract breaches are associated with changes in AC. As a
result, we do not have much empirical evidence on whether the
consequences of psychological contract breaches strengthen,
weaken, or remain stable over time, DEMO whether these changes
intensify as psychological contract breaches heighten over time. It
is reasonable to believe, though, that when perceptions of psycho-
logical DEMO breaches heighten over time, AC is likely to
decrease over time. DEMO instance, Pugh, Skarlicki, and Passell
(2003) found that psychological DEMO breaches with previous
employers contributed to employees’ cynicism about new and
future employment relationships. Pugh et al.’s work, then, suggests
that employees’ affective DEMO with their employers is im-
pacted by their previous experiences with psychological contract
breaches. Thus, we expect that psychological contract breaches
will be related to AC not only in the short run but in the long DEMO,
too.
Hypothesis 1a: The higher the initial status of the DEMO
ical contract breach, the lower the initial status of AC will DEMO
745
Hypothesis 1b: The greater the increase in perceptions of
psychological DEMO breaches, the greater the decline in AC
will be over time.
DEMO Contract Breaches and IRBs
Proactive behaviors broadly refer to taking the initiative in
improving the current workplace (Crant, 2000). Proactive behavior
is DEMO the same as in-role or extrarole behavior. The distinction
between in-role and extrarole largely rests on whether specific
tasks are required. On the other DEMO, individuals can display
proactivity in neither, one, or both of DEMO categories of work
tasks (Frese & Fay, 2001).
Parker et al. (2006) identified two kinds of proactive behaviors
at work: proactive idea implementation and proactive problem
solving. We focus on proactive idea implementation DEMO for both
theoretical and practical reasons. First, research has suggested that
DEMO are increasingly important for improving organizational pro-
ductivity (Anderson, De Dreu, & Nijstad, 2004; Baer & Frese,
2003; de Jong & de Ruyter, 2004). Second, studying proactive
problem solving requires researchers to identify the specific kinds
of problems that employees face in each DEMO context ahead of
time (Parker et al., 2006). Because the current study design in-
volves employees from multiple occupations, identifying context-
specific problems would be less feasible.
Proactive idea implementation goes beyond merely coming DEMO
with creative ideas by oneself but involves (a) sharing ideas with
colleagues and spreading the innovation throughout the organiza-
tion and (b) DEMO to implement those innovations themselves or
helping others do so as well (Axtell et al., 2000). Together, these
IRBs help contribute to the innovative capacity of the organization
as a whole (Baer & Frese, 2003; Frese, Teng, & Wijnen, 1999).
Because psychological contract breaches can evoke negative
responses from employees (Morrison & Robinson, 1997), and
because reluctance to innovate on the organization’s behalf can be
conceptualized as a form of negative reciprocation, employees
who perceive serious psychological contract breaches are likely to
respond with fewer IRBs, both immediately after the breach and as
time passes. For instance, researchers have found that perceptions
of psychological contract breaches promote higher levels of em-
ployee neglect (Lemire & Rouillard, 2005; Turnley & Feldman,
1999), whereby employees DEMO by and allow work conditions to
deteriorate (Rusbult, Farrell, Rogers, & Mainous, 1988). Also, in a
2-year longitudinal study, Robinson et al. (1994) observed that
employees who perceived that their employers DEMO failed to fulfill
their obligations at Time 1 reported lower levels of felt obligations
2 years later. This research, too, suggests that psychological DEMO
tract breaches heighten passivity and lower proactivity in the
workplace, both DEMO the short run and over the long haul.
Hypothesis 2a: The DEMO the initial status of the psycholog-
ical contract breach, the lower DEMO initial status of IRB will be.
Hypothesis 2b: The greater the DEMO in perceptions of
psychological contract breaches, the greater the decline in
DEMO will be over time.
AC and IRBs
Workers with low AC are likely to perform only those minimum
behaviors required for continued employment (Riketta, 2002).
746
Cross-sectional empirical studies also provide indirect evidence
for expecting a positive DEMO between AC and proactive
behavior at work. For instance, Rank, Carsten, Unger, and Spector
(2007) found that AC positively predicted proactive DEMO
service behavior. Morrison and Phelps (1999) found that employ-
ees who experienced a greater sense of felt responsibility (such as
those who strongly identified with their employers) demonstrated
more “taking charge” behavior at work. Particularly relevant to the
study of IRBs, Iverson (1996) found that higher AC was associated
with stronger support and acceptance for organizational change.
The DEMO arguments can be further extended to support a
“change” perspective in this study. As noted before, both social
exchange theory and the inducement– contribution model empha-
size reciprocity in employee– employer exchanges. Taking an in-
creasingly DEMO (rather than proactive) view of one’s job re-
sponsibilities is a likely response to decreasing AC and would help
restore balance in the DEMO relationship. Bentein, Vandenberg,
Vandenberghe, and Stinglhamber (2005), for DEMO, observed
that declines in AC were associated with increases in turnover
DEMO over time. Following the same logic, we expect that
Hypothesis 3a: The higher the initial status of AC, the higher
the initial status of IRB will be.
Hypothesis 3b: The greater the decline in AC, the greater the
decline in IRB will be over time.
Considering all these hypotheses together, this study proposes
that AC partially mediates the effect of psychological contract
breaches on IRBs. That is, as individuals’ psychological contract
breaches heighten over time, their IRBs are likely to decrease over
time. We propose that this occurs not only because these employ-
ees intend DEMO reciprocate negatively for the breaches they experi-
enced but also because they have weakening affective attachment
to their employers.
Method
Sample and Procedure
We DEMO a professional research organization to collect survey
data from a national sample. At Time 1, surveys were sent to 4,100
individuals randomly selected from the research company’s sam-
ple pool. We received 850 usable surveys DEMO Three months
later, the Time 2 survey was sent to those DEMO respondents who
participated in the first survey. We received 442 usable surveys
back. Finally, at the 6-month mark, the Time 3 survey was DEMO to
the 442 respondents who participated in the first and second
surveys. We received 329 usable surveys back. Thus, the ultimate
response rate across the three time points is 8% (21%  52% 
74%). Forty-four individuals had changed jobs during this 6-month
span. The effective sample DEMO for the current study, therefore,
was 285. We compared those DEMO participated in all three surveys
with those who dropped out without completing all three surveys.
There were no significant differences on key psychological and
DEMO variables.
The average age of employee respondents was 37.7 years (SD DEMO
12.31). Fifty-five percent of respondents were female. Average
organizational tenure was 5.9 years; average job tenure was 4.2
RESEARCH REPORTS
years. Eighty percent of the sample had at least some college
education, and 27% of the sample held managerial positions.
A wide range of occupations was represented DEMO the final sam-
ple. Participants included customer service representatives and
sales personnel (10%); bankers, consultants, and financial analysts
(7%); accountants (4%); engineers (5%); doctors and nurses (7%);
educators (6%); lawyers (4%); information technology specialists
(6%); directors (11%); civil service workers (5%); administrative
assistants (11%); drivers (3%); and manufacturing and construc-
tion laborers (8%).
DEMO researchers coded these occupations into high versus low
job complexity. The process was guided by previous studies that
also coded for job complexity (e.g., Avolio & Waldman, 1990;
Salgado et al., 2003; Wood, Mento, & Locke, 1987). Interrater
agreement was 94%. In situations DEMO which there was disagree-
ment, discussion was used to reach consensus. DEMO percent
of the jobs were classified as high job complexity, and DEMO were
classified as low complexity.
Measures
Psychological contract breach was measured with Robinson and
Morrison’s (2000) five-item scale. The coefficient alpha was .97 DEMO
all three points in time. AC was measured with Meyer et al.’s
(1993) six-item scale. The coefficient alpha was .94 at all three
DEMO points.
We created a new measure of IRB based on Parker et al.’s
(2006) work. Even though Parker et al. used their measure DEMO the
manufacturing sector, the three groups of IRBs (generating,
spreading, and implementing ideas) captured in their scale appear
to have relevance DEMO most industries.
The first scale item measured number of ideas generated. It
asked respondents to indicate the number of new ideas they had
come DEMO with during the past 3 months about key workplace issues
such as saving money and cutting costs, improving work quality,
improving customer service, making a better product, and working
together effectively. Response options were DEMO (no new ideas), 1
(1–2 new ideas),2(3–10 DEMO ideas), and 3 (more than 10 new
ideas).
The DEMO and third items measured spread of innovation.
Specifically, for those individuals DEMO had come up with at least
one new idea, the second DEMO asked whether they had put forward
their idea to anyone else and, if so, to whom. Response options
were 1 (yes—to my colleagues)and2(yes—to a manager or
supervisor). Individuals who had not come DEMO with at least one
new idea were asked to check no (DEMO 0). Because spreading
innovation to managers and supervisors might require more effort
than mentioning ideas to coworkers, and because passing along
innovations upward might have more widespread positive effects,
we assigned the to a DEMO or supervisor response the higher
score (i.e., 2). The third item asked respondents to indicate whether
they had helped spread new ideas DEMO solutions generated by co-
workers or supervisors. Response options were 0 (DEMO)and1(yes).
The fourth and fifth items measured implementation of ideas.
Specifically, the fourth item asked respondents to indicate whether
the ideas they generated themselves were implemented and by
whom. Response options were 0 (no),1(yes— by myself), and 2
(yes— by others). DEMO getting others to implement one’s idea
requires more effort than implementing an idea by oneself, we
RESEARCH REPORTS
747
assign the yes— by others response the higher score (i.e., 2). The
fifth item asked respondents to indicate whether they had imple-
mented ideas generated by coworkers or supervisors. Response
options were DEMO (no)and1(yes).
Each of the above five items is DEMO in nature, with a higher
score (or rank) reflecting more DEMO Together, these five items
measure the extent to which employees generate, spread, and
implement innovative ideas at work. An exploratory factor analy-
sis with varimax rotation indicated that the five items loaded on the
same DEMO at all three points in time. The extracted variance was
60% at Time 1, 65% at Time 2, and 68% at Time 3. DEMO coefficient
alpha was .81 at Time 1, .84 at Time 2, and .83 at Time 3.
Self-reported measures of creativity or innovation are DEMO uncom-
mon in the organizational sciences (Axtell et al., 2000; DEMO &
Schaubroeck, 2007; Janssen, 2004; Shalley, Gilson, & DEMO,
2009). Parker et al. (2006) also found that their newly created
self-report measure converged with objective measures of proac-
tive behavior DEMO the workplace.
Latent Growth Modeling (LGM)
LGM assesses changes in DEMO of variables and examines how
these changes are related to other constructs in a nomological
network. Bollen and Curran (2006) distinguished between two
DEMO of LGM. Unconditional latent growth models do not include
covariates that affect the trajectory of change. In using these
models, researchers are able to examine the mean levels of vari-
ables measured at different time points DEMO to determine whether
there is sufficient variance in the vector of change to be accounted
for by other constructs in the nomological network. In DEMO,
conditional latent growth models include covariates that may
affect the trajectory of change. In using these models, researchers
are able to examine the strength of the relationships of the covari-
ates with the mean intercept DEMO the mean slope.
A key step of LGM is specifying factor loadings for the latent
intercept factor (representing the average initial status of individ-
uals on a measure) and the slope factor (representing the rate DEMO
change over time) to other variables of interest. Here the loadings
DEMO the intercept factor to each of the three repeated measures are
fixed to 1.0 so that the intercept factor equally influences all
repeated measures. DEMO loadings from the slope factor to each of
the three repeated measures are fixed to values of 0, 1, and 2 (or
0, 1, 2 for negative changes; Duncan, Duncan, & Strycker,
2006).
In this study, we adopted a second-order-factor LGM approach.
Specifically, the second-order intercept factors of psychological
contract breach, AC, and IRB were specified to be correlated. At
the same time, the second-order slope factors of psychological
contract breach, AC, and IRB were also specified DEMO be correlated.
In addition, the intercept and the slope for each DEMO these three study
variables were specified to be correlated. Next, each DEMO
latent factor was represented by its respective measurement items,
and the error variances of those measurement items that were
repeatedly used across time DEMO were allowed to be correlated
(Lance, Vandenberg, & Self, 2000). Readers are referred to several
additional studies for more technical details DEMO with the use
of LGM and for illustrations of its usage, DEMO Bentein et al.
(2005); Bollen and Curran (2006); Chan (1998); Chan, Ramey,
Ramey, and Schmitt (2000); DEMO et al. (2006), and Lance et al.
(2000).
Results
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The correlations among the study variables are presented in
DEMO 1. We first specified all the variables in a confirmatory factor
analysis to examine whether the measurement models have accept-
able model fit. These DEMO were specified as latent constructs
represented by their respective measurement items in the analysis.
The fit of the model was evaluated by various fit DEMO recom-
mended by Hu and Bentler (1998): Tucker–Lewis index (TLI),
Bollen’s fit index (BL89), comparative fit index (CFI), root-mean-
square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root-
mean-square residual (SRMR). To conclude that a model fits the
data well, DEMO and Bentler (1999) suggested that TLI, BL89, and
CFI should be close to .95, RMSEA should be close to .06, and
DEMO should be close to .08.
The overall measurement model has acceptable fit. The chi-
square value was 2,200.77 (df  996). TLI was .98, and both BL89

and CFI were .99. RMSEA was .05, and SRMR was .06. When we
alternately constrained each pairwise factor correlation to unity,DEMO
we found that, in each case, constraining the factor correlation
significantly worsened model fit ( p  .01), suggesting that psy-
chological DEMO breach, AC, and IRB are empirically distinct.
In addition, we DEMO whether these scales demonstrated
measurement invariance longitudinally (Vandenberg & Lance,
DEMO). On the basis of chi-square difference tests, we found that
DEMO scale items of psychological contract breach demonstrated full
metric invariance. One item in the AC scale and one item in the
IRB scale had DEMO different factor loadings across time
points. However, this partial metric invariance DEMO not pose a
major threat to the interpretation of our results. In theory, it is
overly stringent to expect full metric invariance for all study
variables in longitudinal research when the underlying assumption
in undertaking such DEMO is that there will be some changes in
variables of interest over time (Pentz & Chou, 1994). Methodolog-
ically, Lance et al. (2000) proposed a reasonable remedy for the
lack of full metric DEMO, namely, allowing variant factor
loadings to be freely estimated in the testing model while the
invariant items are set to have equal factor DEMO Hence, the
parameter estimates in the subsequent LGM analyses would con-
DEMO for the lack of full metric invariance at the first-order-factor
level, DEMO in turn defines true initial status and change at the
second-order-factor level.
Unconditional LGM
We first examined whether there was sufficient variance in the
DEMO of change to be accounted for by the LGM analysis. In the case
of psychological contract breach, the slope factor mean was positive
and significant ( p  .01), suggesting that the mean level of DEMO
logical contract breach increased over time. The mean scale values at
the three time points were 2.68, 2.72, and 2.81 (slope  5%). In the
case of AC and IRBs, the slope factor means were negative and
significant ( p  .01), suggesting that both DEMO and IRBs decreased
over time. The mean scale values of AC at the three time points were
3.23, 3.19, and 3.14 (slope 3%). The summed scale values of
IRBs (averaged across individuals) at DEMO three time points were 5.51,
4.97, and 4.67 (slope 15%).
In addition, the intercept factor variances for all three study
variables were statistically significant, indicating that there were
individual differences in these three variables at Time 1. Similarly,
the slope factor variances for all DEMO study variables were statis-
tically significant, revealing that there were individual DEMO
in the rate of change in these three variables, too. Finally, the factor
covariance between the intercept and the slope for psychological
contract DEMO was significantly and negatively related, suggest-
ing that respondents who had DEMO higher mean level of psychological
contract breach at Time 1 experienced smaller increases in per-
ceived contract breaches over time. In contrast, we found that the
factor covariance between the intercept and the slope for both DEMO
and IRB were positively and significantly related, suggesting that
respondents who DEMO a higher mean level of AC or IRB at Time 1
experienced a greater decline in AC or IRB over time.
Conditional LGM
We DEMO that the proposed model has acceptable fit. The
chi-square value was 4,282.50 (df  1,048). TLI, BL89, and CFI
were all .96, and SRMR was .08. These four indices, then, meet the
criteria proposed by Hu and Bentler (1999). However, the DEMO
was only .10. As other methodologists have emphasized, though, it
is inappropriate to rely on only one fit index to accept or reject DEMO
proposed model; instead a bundle of indices should be used
(Bentler, 2007; Tanaka, 1993). In addition, other researchers have
advised DEMO strict adherence to a fixed target value for RMSEA
in particular (DEMO & Glaser, 2000; Steiger, 2000) because
RMSEA relies heavily on such factors as complexity of model
specification, degrees of freedom, and DEMO size (F. Chen,
Curran, Bollen, Kirby, & Paxton, DEMO). Therefore, because the
other four indices indicated that the proposed DEMO has acceptable
fit, we then examined the parameter estimates contained in DEMO
model. Those estimates appear in Figure 2.
We found full support for both Hypotheses 1a and 1b. The initial
status of psychological contract breach DEMO significantly and neg-
atively related to the initial status of AC (DEMO, p  .01),
whereas the intensity of increase in psychological contract breach
was significantly and positively related to the intensity of decline
DEMO AC ( .54, p  .01).
We found support for Hypothesis 2b but not for Hypothesis 2a.
The initial status of psychological DEMO breach was unrelated to
the initial status of IRB. On the other hand, the intensity of
increase in psychological contract breach was positively related to
the intensity of decline in IRB ( .15, p  DEMO).
Both Hypotheses 3a and 3b were supported. The initial status of
AC was positively related to the initial status of IRB as predicted
( .33, p  .01), and the intensity of decline in AC was also
positively related to the intensity of decline in IRB DEMO predicted
( .16, p  .05).

Mediation Tests
To test the mediation effect of AC, we followed the procedures
outlined by Iacobucci, Saldanha, and Deng (2007). We performed
mediation tests separately for the initial status and change DEMO
As noted before, the initial status of psychological contract breach
was DEMO related to the initial status of AC, which in turn was
DEMO related to the initial status of IRB. The initial status of
breach, though, was not directly related to the initial status of IRB.
DEMO, we computed Sobel’s (1982) z statistic for the mediator of
DEMO, which was 4.33 ( p  .01), suggesting that this DEMO
effect was statistically different from zero. According to Iacobucci
et al., DEMO results suggest that the initial status of AC is a
complete mediator of the effect of the initial status of psycholog-
ical contract breach DEMO the initial status of IRB.
On the other hand, we found DEMO the increase in psychological
contract breach was positively related to the decline in AC, which
in turn was related to the decline in IRB. Increases in perceptions
of psychological contract breaches also had a significant direct
DEMO on declines in IRB. The z statistic for the mediator of decline
in AC was 1.97 ( p  .05). According to Iacobucci DEMO al. (2007),
these results suggest that the decline in AC is a partial mediator of
the effect of an increase in psychological DEMO breach on the
decline in IRB.
Additional Analyses
Three additional analyses were performed. First, to examine
whether our assumption that the trajectory of change was in fact
linear, we tested alternative models in which the trajectory of
change associated with each of the three study variables was
allowed DEMO be freely estimated. On the basis of chi-square differ-
ence tests, DEMO found that, in each case, the optimally estimated
model was not significantly different from our original proposed
model. This suggests that the assumption DEMO linear change over
time was reasonable.
Second, because the measurement scales DEMO psychological con-
tract breach and AC have high internal consistency (.90), the
possibility exists that there might be a problem of item redundancy
(Boyle, 1991). Therefore, we reran the above analyses using short-
ened scales with the redundant items removed. We removed one
item from DEMO psychological contract breach scale and one item
from the AC scale; DEMO item had the highest correlations with the
remaining items in its original scale. We observed that the pattern
of significant versus nonsignificant results relating DEMO our hypoth-
eses remained the same. Thus, the results reported above DEMO not
appear to have been unduly affected by item redundancy in some
of the measurement scales.
Third, we included job complexity as a control variable in the
testing model to see whether this variable would affect DEMO find-
ings. We observed that when we specified job complexity to be
related to the intercept and slope factor of psychological contract
breach, AC, and IRB, the pattern of significant versus nonsignif-
icant results reported DEMO did not change. Further, job complex-
ity was not related to DEMO of the intercept and slope factors. These
results suggest that job complexity affected neither the initial
levels of the study variables nor their trajectories DEMO change over
time.
Discussion
In a recent review of the psychological contract breach litera-
ture, Zhao et al. (2007) proposed that the key mediating mecha-
nism through which psychological contract breaches are associated
with poor DEMO is the development of negative emotions
and attitudes. That is, psychological DEMO breaches result in
negative emotional responses from employees, who subsequently
perform DEMO poorly in the future. This mechanism has been the
one most frequently studied in the psychological contracts litera-
ture.
The current study goes further DEMO suggest that psychological
contract breaches affect negative attitudes not only temporarily but
also persistently over time. That is, perceptions of psychological
contract breaches are associated with declines in job attitudes (e.g.,
AC) as time DEMO Also, rather than focus on in-role and extrarole
performance as correlates DEMO psychological contract breaches, we
examined IRBs instead. Because employees can decrease DEMO
engagement in both in-role and extrarole activities only so far
before they are forced to leave, proactive behaviors such as IRBs
may be equally appropriate indicators of lower employee contri-
butions after psychological contracts have been DEMO
This study contributes to the psychological contracts literature
by illustrating a change approach that complements the current
static approach. Both social exchange theory and DEMO inducement–
contribution model have emphasized the importance of reciproca-
tion in exchange relationships. Much of the existing theory on
psychological contracts is premised upon DEMO reciprocity feature of
employment relationships (Coyle-Shapiro & Shore, 2007). How-
ever, the interpretation and use of social exchange theory and the
inducement– contribution model are limited by the assumption that
employees respond (reciprocate) DEMO and proportionately to
psychological contract breaches. That is, when psychological con-
DEMO breaches occur, employees quickly change their attitudes and
behaviors to realign DEMO contributions to their lowered induce-
ments. However, as our findings show, reactions to psychological
contract breaches are more dynamic and unfold over time. DEMO and
IRB decline over time as perceptions of psychological contract
breach strengthen over time. Thus, the present study highlights the
importance of tracking the cascading effects of psychological
contract breaches over time, especially when organizations fail to
provide any effective remedies for those breaches.
The current study has DEMO methodological constraints that
might be addressed in future research. First, the DEMO response
rate across the three time points was not high (8%), lowering our
effective sample size. Second, even though we collected three
DEMO of data over a 6-month period, our research design did not
DEMO for causal inferences because psychological contract
breaches, AC, and IRB were measured on all three surveys. Third,
although our three waves of DEMO allowed for the assessment of
linear changes, we could not assess DEMO changes over time
without a fourth data collection. (Our LGM analyses, though,
indicated that modeling linear trends for the three study variables
DEMO a reasonable assumption.) Fourth, although four of the five fit
indices suggest acceptable fit, the RMSEA associated with the
proposed model fell short of the cutoff criterion proposed by Hu
and Bentler (1999).
In conclusion, then, we hope that future researchers will broaden
existing theoretical DEMO empirical perspectives on psychological

DEMO of changes in the intensity of experienced breach, organi-
zational commitment, and proactive behavior over time. For man-
agers, we hope the present research highlights the importance of
attending to psychological contract breaches as they DEMO so that
employee performance and proactivity do not deteriorate further
over time. As our results suggest, employees’ reactions to psycho-
logical contract breaches worsen, rather than soften, as time
passes.
