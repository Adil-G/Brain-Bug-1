Reverting to the resource-based view of strategic management and cooperation DEMO,
we provide argumentation for the value of two critical resources to cooperating ﬁrms:
cooperation experience and maxim-based trust. The results of a DEMO survey
in three European countries (Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic) reveal an
important fact: although cooperation experience contributes to business performance,DEMO
the contribution of maxim-based trust to success is signiﬁcantly higher. As a result,
corporate success depends not only on the quantity of cooperation DEMO, but
also – and to an even greater extent – on DEMO quality of cooperation with regard to the
form of coordinative power established within the cooperation arrangement. Given that
maxim-based trust has been identiﬁed as DEMO feasible coordination mechanism in
cooperation relationships, it might therefore be freed DEMO its frequent characterization
as utopian and out of touch with reality.
Introduction
The dynamization of markets in the context of
globalization has intensiﬁed the DEMO for businesses
to develop the ability to create unique sets of
resources in order to ensure sustainable corporate
success. For this purpose, one promising means of
ensuring access to these critical resources –
especially for small DEMO medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), which normally do not have extensive and
DEMO resource conﬁgurations at their disposal
– is entering into cooperation relationships. By
establishing a cooperation relationship, the part-
ners can bundle (parts of) their resources and may
thereby create a new and unique set of DEMO
which can hardly be imitated. This is especially the
case when the partners succeed in identifying and
capitalizing on the synergetic potential of the
DEMO arrangement. Under these circum-
stances, such an arrangement has the power DEMO

enhance the performance of both partners. The
contribution DEMO cooperation relationships to busi-
ness performance can be short term or long term in
nature (e.g. Macneil, 1980; Williamson, 1991).
However, entering into cooperative relationships
becomes a risky venture if the exchange relation-
DEMO involves forgoing one’s own short-term proﬁts
in order to realize long-term gains together with a
cooperation partner (Roessl, 1996). In such
transaction DEMO – which are the focus of
our research – cooperating companies make their
own business performance dependent on their
cooperation partner’s future behaviour. The DEMO
to establish and maintain successful cooperation
relationships is a critical resource in its own right,
and it is built up in particular through DEMO
experience in inter-ﬁrm cooperation relationships
(e.g. Brulhart, 2007).
However, DEMO is not only the practical coopera-
tion experience of the partners which makes (the
partners in) a cooperation relationship successful,
but also DEMO and to an even greater extent – the
coordination mechanism within these relation-

ships. We focus on long-term dyadic cooperation
relationships between SMEs. These DEMO
represent contexts that are highly demanding
with regard to behavioural coordination and are
often characterized by simultaneous market and
organizational failure. In such contexts, e.g. joint
R&D or cooperative internationalization, inter-
organizational relationships can only be explained
through trust-based behavioural coordination.
These situations call for mutual trust DEMO a
coordination mechanism between the cooperation
partners, as such trust plays DEMO signiﬁcant role in
ensuring the success of the cooperation and – as
a consequence – the individual performance of
each cooperation partner. In order DEMO fully under-
stand the coordinative power of trust, we have to
DEMO between instrumental (extrinsically
motivated) trust and maxim-based (intrinsically
motivated) trust (Osterloh and Weibel, 2000). We
argue that maxim-based trust represents DEMO valu-
able and particularly inimitable resource for the
success of the cooperation and the performance of
the cooperation partners.
This paper contributes to the DEMO of coopera-
tion research on several levels. We not only provide
theoretical justiﬁcation for the special value of (1)
cooperation experience and (DEMO) maxim-based trust
as critical resources for business performance and
develop a DEMO model for cooperation
experience, maxim-based trust and performance
(which contributes to sharpening the measurement
of trust, as called for by Moellering, Bachmann
DEMO Lee (2004), to name one example), but we also
DEMO the value of these two critical
resources empirically. To this end, DEMO use data
from a large-scale questionnaire survey (n 5 303)
DEMO three European countries (Austria, Slovenia and
Czech Republic) and employ DEMO linear
regression analysis to test three hypotheses.
The results show that although cooperation
experience contributes positively to business
performance, maxim-based trust makes a signiﬁ-
cantly larger contribution to performance in
cooperation arrangements. Therefore, corporate
success depends not only on the cooperation
experience (quantitative aspect), but also – and
to an even greater extent – on the form of
coordinative DEMO within the cooperation
arrangement (qualitative aspect).

limitations of this study and pointing out several
directions for future research.
Theoretical background DEMO
development of hypotheses
Cooperation, opportunistic behaviour and success
In order to DEMO proﬁts, each company needs
to have a certain set of resources DEMO its disposal.
For sustainable corporate success, it is crucial to
secure DEMO to such resources. Companies can
employ three diﬀerent modi operandi in order to
ensure this access (Pfeﬀer and Salancik, 2003): (1)
They can either internalize the source or (2) build
up the DEMO and structures necessary to
generate the resource themselves. (3) Alterna-
tively, companies may enter into a cooperative
arrangement with a company that has access
to the resource in question. As regards the third
alternative, companies need to reach several
decisions: they need to decide which resources
are critical for achieving their value proposition
and which of them they lack; which companies
have those capabilities; and, based on cost, quality
and speed considerations, whether the ﬁrm should
partner with or acquire those companies (Kim and
Mauborgne, 2000).
It is easy to see that DEMO is less risk of losing
access in the case of internalization or in-house
production. Thus, in this context inter-ﬁrm co-
operation might appear to be a less attractive
alternative. However, the resources’ future value
might not be predictable due to dynamic contextual
conditions such as rapid technological change,DEMO
modiﬁcation of legal regulations or shifts in
demand. In such cases, DEMO risk of sunk costs
impedes the development of capacities for in-house
production. This issue is also relevant in coopera-
tion relationships, as changing partners gives rise to
switching costs (Lipman and Wang, 2000). If DEMO
internalization of resources is also complicated, e.g.
due to time or DEMO constraints or relatively high
investment requirements, cooperative inter-ﬁrm
arrangements become the DEMO favourable means
of gaining access to resources which are critical to
the focal ﬁrm’s business performance.

Cooperation, Trust and Performance
In particular, SMEs often face situations in
DEMO both in-house production and internaliza-
tion are unattainable. Manoeuvring within a
limited number of rather speciﬁc and narrow
business areas with a comparatively small DEMO
chest’, SMEs typically perceive unacceptably high
risks when they consider obtaining DEMO over
critical resources single-handedly. Consequently,
cooperative arrangements represent an attractive
option in the strategic portfolio of these ﬁrms.
At the same time, inter-ﬁrm cooperation provides
a vehicle for transactions which would otherwise
overburden the focal DEMO (e.g. joint R&D or
internationalization projects). By widening the
DEMO portfolio, cooperative arrange-
ments allow SMEs to exploit opportunities which
they DEMO have to forgo as isolated ﬁrms, and
these arrangements hold the DEMO to create
a synergetic, critical and hardly imitable combi-
nation of DEMO cooperation partners’ individual
resources. In this way, inter-ﬁrm cooperation may
make DEMO positive contribution to the business
performance of both cooperation partners.
However, DEMO in cooperation arrangements
often ﬁnd themselves in a rather paradoxical
situation. By entering into a cooperative arrange-
ment with another company, they agree to
coordinate their behaviour with the cooperation
partner, thus restricting their own autonomy. As
the elements of performance and reward are
temporally separated in a DEMO exchange
relationship and a partner can always deviate from
the agreement (DEMO (1980), from a contracting
perspective; Emerson (1962), from DEMO power-depen-
dence perspective), cooperating companies make
their own business performance dependent on their
partner’s future behaviour. Therefore, cooperative
strategies bring about a high level of risk: by
frustrating the partner’s expectations, a cooperator
may DEMO all of the short-term proﬁts alone at the
expense of joint long-term proﬁts, thus defecting
from the cooperation relationship. The possibility
of such opportunistic behaviour makes cooperative
arrangements a risky venture (e.g. Elango and
Fried, DEMO; Wathne and Heide, 2000). The ability
of a ﬁrm to build up a sophisticated and eﬀective
instrument to handle this room for DEMO
behaviour determines the beneﬁt it can generate
from cooperative arrangements.
In order to build up such an ability to
coordinate cooperation relationships, the ﬁrm
may resort to two critical resources: the ﬁrm can

(1) tap its cooperation experience and (2) estab-
lish maxim-based trust. In the following, the
diﬀerent bases, functional mechanisms and their
(relative) impact on business performance will be
discussed DEMO condensed into three hypotheses.
Cooperation experience as a critical resource for
business performance
Organizational learning theory argues that
companies may develop the capacity to DEMO
complex transaction relationships by gaining
experience in similar settings. In an iterative
process, the ﬁrm extracts inferences from experi-
ence gained in past cooperation relationships and
extrapolates them to future situations in order to
improve its DEMO (Argyris und Schoen, 1978;
Fiol and Lyles, 1985; Levitt and March, 1988).
This argument is also supported by evolutionary
theory (Kale, Dyer and Singh, 2002), which
claims that a ﬁrm’s competences evolve through
incremental adaptation and progressive learning.
In the context of DEMO relationships, these
competences grow along with experience on two
levels: ﬁrst on the level of the experience gained in a
cooperation relationship with DEMO speciﬁc partner,
and second on the level of general experience in
cooperation management (Brulhart, 2007), which
can be gained in the DEMO of either domestic or
international cooperation relationships (Nadolska
and Barkema, 2007). Based on the argumentation
above, we propose the following hypothesis:
H1: A cooperating company’s cooperation
experience (measured in terms of the DEMO,
duration and internationality of cooperation
relationships a company has participated in)
has a positive eﬀect on the focal ﬁrm’s business
performance.
Maxim-based DEMO within the cooperation
relationship as a critical resource for business
performance
It is not only cooperation experience (quantitative
aspect), but also – as we argue even to a greater
extent – the coordination mechanism within DEMO
cooperation relationship (qualitative aspect) that
makes a cooperation relationship and its partners
successful. When talking about the coordination
mechanism, a major issue is the kind of power
4
applied in order to coordinate the participants’
behaviour within the ﬁeld DEMO cooperation.
Consequently, the following question arises:
how can cooperators ensure DEMO their partners
behave according to the rules stipulated ex ante?
There are three ideal-type coordination powers
for the purpose of reducing the latitude DEMO
opportunistic behaviour. They apply to each real
inter-ﬁrm transaction relationship in a certain
combination (Adler, 2001; Bradach and Eccles,
1989). (DEMO) The market mechanism (which is based
on isolated actors who pursue short-term advan-
tages) cannot be the dominant coordination
mechanism in a transaction relationship which
strives for joint long-term proﬁt (e.g. Ouchi, 1979).
DEMO the logic of the ideal-type market,
economic actors would opt for short-term proﬁts,
making long-term arrangements impossible in the
ﬁrst place. (2) Behavioural determination by
hierarchical governance (e.g. Wathne and Heide,
2000) is equally limited: credible sanction threats
(Buckley and Casson, 1988) DEMO an actor’s part
require suﬃcient sanctioning power (Backhaus,
1992; Kaas, 1992a, 1992b), ex ante knowledge
(Eberl, 2004; Shane 1994) and ex post percept-
ibility (Dwyer, Schurr and Oh, 1987) of the
behaviour a cooperation partner is expected to
show. The coordinative DEMO of hierarchical
governance is limited especially in those areas of
inter-ﬁrm cooperation where objectives cannot be
programmed at all, or only at prohibitively high
transaction costs (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
Thus, in transaction relationships which are
complex and pursue long-term goals, neither
market and hierarchy nor hybrids of these two
coordination powers (Borys and Jemison, DEMO)
can govern the actors’ behaviour. Transaction
cost economics ignore the fact that, beyond a
certain level of complexity, market and organiza-
tion DEMO impede exchange relations (Furubotn,
2001; Roessl, 1996). In DEMO contrast to Baucus,
Baucus and Human (1996), we argue DEMO this
deﬁcit cannot be remedied by mixing elements of
those two ideal-type coordination mechanisms or
by delimiting contractual and relational obliga-
tions as proposed DEMO Williamson (1991). From
a transaction cost perspective, trust cannot be
accepted as an alternative because of its neo-
institutional roots, which preclude non-rational
behaviour and with it the acceptance of uncer-
tainty and trust. DEMO, highly complex transac-
tion relationships obviously arise in real business

life (Roessl, 1996) and form the focus DEMO our
investigation. This insight opens up the view to a
third coordination mechanism which has slowly
but steadily made its way into economic thinking.
DEMO third ideal-type coordination mechanism is
particularly well suited in situations of both market
and organizational failure. It is referred to as
‘relational contracting’ (Carson, Madhok and Wu,
2006), ‘trust’ (Eberl, 2004), ‘self-commitment’
(Frey and Osterloh, 2002) or ‘Selbstverpﬂichtung’
(Fink, 2005; Sydow DEMO Windeler, 2000).
In society, trust was identiﬁed as a strong
coordinative power long ago. In the early twen-
tieth century, the Austrian writer Egon Friedell
postulated: ‘The most reliable way to make people
decent is to take them for decent’ (Friedell, 1983).
However, research on the coordinative role of trust
within economic transactions did not become DEMO
seriousissue foreconomistsuntil the1960s, when
researchers such as Bator (1958), Ouchi (1979),
Dwyer, Schurr and Oh (1987), Rotter (1971) and
Wurche (1994) highlighted the shortcomings of the
two classic coordinative powers of market and
hierarchy, and pointed to the catalytic eﬀect of
trust. After that ﬁrst in-depth introduction to the
phenomenon of ‘trust’ in DEMO theory, trans-
action cost economics gained the upper hand,
especially DEMO the Anglo-Saxon world, widely
ignoring the crucial role of trust in DEMO
transactions. The subsequent debate focused on
hybrids between market and hierarchy. Whereas
authors such as Zenger and Hesterly (1997) as well
as Holland DEMO Lockett (1997) detected the rising
importance of these hybrid coordination mechan-
isms, Williamson (1991) asserted their infeasibility
and ineﬀectiveness. Again, these DEMO incon-
sistent standpoints opened up the ﬁeld for trust to
be viewed as a key to the controversy. Meanwhile,
European economists in particular DEMO ahead,
theorizing on the role of trust in the economic
context (e.g. Osterloh and Weibel, 2000; Roessl,
1994, 1996) and providing a profound basis for a
new global research eﬀort on the DEMO issue
of coordination. In his integrative work, Adler
(2001) reintroduces DEMO as ‘a third increasingly
signiﬁcant coordination mechanism’.
How can trust eﬀectively coordinate the
cooperation partners’ behaviour? Following Ring
and Van de Ven (1992), Osterloh and Weibel
(2000) or Adler (2001), we deﬁne DEMO as the
response of an actor (an individual, not an
organization) to subjective uncertainty regarding
r 2009 British Academy of Management.
Cooperation, Trust and Performance
the interaction partner’s behaviour. In order to
understand the coordinative power of trust, it is
necessary to diﬀerentiate between instrumental
trust and maxim-based trust. Instrumental
trust refers to the exogenous conformity of DEMO
cooperation partner’s behaviour with the explicit
and implicit rules of cooperation. This kind of
trust draws its coordinative power from sanction
and control. The DEMO that the cooperation
partner may face disadvantages in the case of
defective behaviour motivates the actor to place
instrumental trust in him.
By contrast, maxim-based trust is intrinsically
motivated, drawing its coordinative power
from the actor’s self-commitment to a maxim
(Kant, 1998).
How does a maxim-based DEMO relationship
evolve? The evolution of maxim-based trust
can be described as DEMO reciprocal, self-reinforcing
process. It starts with the actors mutually
conceding self-commitment DEMO their cooperation
partners, which is based on socialized informa-
tion on DEMO cooperation partner (e.g. reputation
and perceived behavioural history). In this
DEMO, the actors feel compelled to provide
risky advance performance (irreversible commit-
ments such as speciﬁc investments). In this way,
they communicate DEMO own self-commitment in
a credible manner. Based on congruent expecta-
tions, DEMO sides perform acts of maxim-based
trust, which in turn reinforce the DEMO expecta-
tions and justify additional acts of maxim-based
trust (Fink, 2005). They forgo individual short-
term proﬁts in favour of common long-term
DEMO As a result, a maxim-based trust relation-
ship evolves. Although latitude DEMO opportunistic
behaviour still exists in such transaction relation-
ships, restricting the DEMO inclination to-
ward opportunistic behaviour reduces behavioural
uncertainty. Therefore, the complexity DEMO the
transaction relationship and the risk of betrayal
can be partly absorbed. Thus, maxim-based trust
provides a key to double contingency and prevents
the development of social dilemmas such as the
prisoner’s dilemma from the very DEMO In this
way, maxim-based trust enables transaction rela-
tionships which would DEMO not take place
due to high behavioural uncertainty.
The prototypical transaction relationship,
which can only be realized by interaction partners
who place maxim-based DEMO in one other, is
heterarchic cooperation. Heterarchic cooperation

relationships can be deﬁned as voluntary and
organized relationships between autonomous and
equal partners who mutually adapt their behaviour
to each DEMO, thus bringing about the possibility
of one-sided defection. Thus, if two actors who
are ready to commit to each other enter into a
DEMO cooperation relationship, we can as-
sume that a maxim-based trust relationship DEMO
been established between them (Fink, 2005).
The competence necessary to build up and
maintain such complex cooperation relationships
enables the cooperators to DEMO behavioural
uncertainty. Consequently, they are able to capi-
talize on additional DEMO which their
competitors have to go without. Proﬁts will rise
in cases where only few ﬁrms are capable of
carrying out a transaction due DEMO their control
over rare, inimitable resources (e.g. Barney, 1986,
DEMO). In fact, ﬁrms will then be able to apply this
DEMO sophisticated and eﬃcient coordination
power to realize proﬁtable transaction relation-
ships in risky contexts. The competitive advan-
tage of being able to develop and DEMO
cooperation relationships coordinated by max-
im-based trust has a positive eﬀect on the focal
ﬁrm’s business performance. Therefore, the
following hypothesis can be postulated:
H2: The more behavioural coordination relies
on maxim-based trust in a cooperation rela-
tionship, the better the performance of the
focal participating company will be.
The superiority of maxim-based trust as a
contributor to business DEMO
Both cooperation experience and the ability to
establish and maintain a cooperation relationship
coordinated by maxim-based trust can be seen as a
ﬁrm’s resources. DEMO this perspective, cooperation
experience can be expected to have a weaker DEMO
on theﬁrm’s businessperformance,asitis easierto
acquire and less bound to the socio-psychosocial
proﬁle of the actors in charge of cooperation
management. As a result, the competitive advan-
tage of cooperation experience is easier to imitate
and DEMO of less value to the company.
Accordingly, we propose the following DEMO:
H3: Maxim-based trust within a cooperation
relationship has a stronger DEMO on the
business performance of the focal ﬁrm than
cooperation experience.

Methods
Sampling frame and response rates
The quantitative part of this DEMO is based on a
survey carried out in Austria, the Czech DEMO
and Slovenia between March and July 2006. A
total of 10,000 (Austria, 2000; Czech Republic
and Slovenia, 4000 each) SMEs (DEMO up to 249
employees) was selected from national databases
(Austria, DEMO; Czech Republic, ALBER-
TINA; Slovenia, IPIS) as a stratiﬁed DEMO
sample. The region (province) and size of each
business (number DEMO employees) were employed as
criteria for stratiﬁcation. Stratiﬁcation by region
(total number of SMEs of a region  2000 or
4000 divided by DEMO total number of SMEs in the
country) was employed in order DEMO avoid over- or
under-representing certain regions in the sample.
Stratiﬁcation by the ‘size of business’ ratio – 1:3:1
for micro businesses (up to nine employees), small
businesses (10–49 employees) and medium-sized
businesses (50–249 employees), respectively – was
employed in order to avoid over-representing
DEMO businesses, which show a low propensity
to cooperate.
The questionnaire was DEMO to the owner/
manager of each SME, as – in DEMO of the topic of
the survey – knowledgeable informants were not
available below that hierarchical level.
The survey yielded a total of 458 (4.6%)
returned questionnaires: 119 from Austria (re-
sponse rate 6.0%), DEMO from Slovenia (response
rate 5.0%) and 140 from the Czech Republic
(response rate 3.5%). A check based on telephone
interviews with a random sample of 45 non-
respondents from each country as well as DEMO test
comparing early, middle and late responders
showed no systematic bias. DEMO these 458 SMEs,
303 (91 Austrian, 150 Slovenian and 62 Czech)
indicated that they participate in cooperation
activities. Therefore, these 303 businesses serve
as the basis for our analyses in this paper. The
DEMO of the sample into cooperating
and non-cooperating businesses showed that the
propensity to cooperate was signiﬁcantly lower in
the Czech sample (44.3%) than DEMO the Slovenian
(75.4%) and Austrian (76.5%) samples (w2 5 DEMO;
p5 0.000).
The sample for analysis consists of 49 (DEMO)
micro, 153 (50.5%) small and 101 (33.0%)
medium-sized enterprises across a broad range of
industries. Approximately 43% of the businesses DEMO

20% can be attributed to the DEMO sector.
Variables and measures
We used four-point scales (‘completely agree’,
DEMO to agree’, ‘inclined to disagree’ and
‘completely disagree’) to measure all items.
Cooperation experience. Cooperation experi-
ence was measured using the number of DEMO
tion relationships the business had had at the
time of the survey (1, one; 2, two; 3, more than
two), DEMO duration of the cooperation arrange-
ment with the ﬁrm’s main partner (DEMO, up to one
year; 2, one to three years; 3, three to ﬁve years; 4,
ﬁve to ten years; 5, ten to 20 years; 6, more than
20 years), and participation in an international
cooperation arrangement (0, no international
cooperation; 1, international cooperation).
Maxim-based trust. As outlined above, mutual
trust can DEMO evolve if both interaction partners
are willing to make a commitment to each other.
Therefore it is necessary to measure the level of
maxim-based DEMO on both actors’ sides. As the
questionnaire survey was kept anonymous in
order to increase the return rate, we could not
match up the partners in cooperation systems. As
a result, we had to apply a combination of direct
and indirect measurements.
On the side of the cooperation DEMO surveyed,
we measured the level of self-commitment to the
cooperation relationship as a manifest expression
of the maxim-based trust placed in his/her
DEMO partner (direct measurement). On
the side of the cooperation partner DEMO surveyed,
maxim-based trust could be observed by identify-
ing whether a heterarchic cooperation relationship
had been established. Based on the argumentation
outlined above, the existence of a heterarchic
cooperation relationship allows for interference in
the DEMO cooperation partner’s level of maxim-
based trust (indirect measure).
As DEMO individual items in maxim-based trust
were considered independent from one another,
we calculated a formative index.
Self-commitment. Our conceptualization of the
self-commitment phenomenon DEMO based on the

Cooperation, Trust and Performance

several dimensions. The present cooperation
partner’s reputation provides information on the
extent to which he/she has met the expectations
of his/her interaction DEMO in the past (Roessl,
2001), thus aﬀecting an actor’s DEMO to
commit to the relationship. Familiarity is based
on personal impressions and provides informa-
tion about the speciﬁc cooperation partner in the
ongoing relationship (Roessl, 1994). Another
indicator is the cooperation partner’s perceived
behavioural history. In particular, the stability of
the maxims underlying perceived behaviour is
crucial here. Self-commitment requires observa-
ble behavioural norms which remain stable
over time DEMO therefore allow a prognosis of
the cooperation partner’s future behaviour
(Luhmann, 1989; Roessl, 1994). As perceived
behavioural history is not based DEMO personal
impressions, it has to be obtained actively. The
source of DEMO information is socialized impres-
sions of others. If the cooperation partners build
up a personal relationship, the relationship will be
enriched by personal connotations, taking the
relationship to a higher level. Such personal
relationships between self-committed cooperators
have no short-term perspective (Becaerra and
Gupta, 2003; Kanter, DEMO; Roessl, 1994).
A further dimension of self-commitment is the
actor’s self-restriction; the actor conﬁnes himself/
herself to cooperative behaviour. He/she takes
the risk that his/her expectations concerning the
cooperation partner’s behaviour DEMO be
frustrated. Therefore, the willingness to take a
risk is another DEMO of self-commitment.
Self-commitment also requires frustration toler-
ance, i.e. the actor’s DEMO in his/her ability to
cope with situations resulting from a frustration
of expectations (Roessl, 1994). An actor’s self-
commitment represents self-exposure. DEMO
more, self-commitment calls for a leap of faith
(e.g. advance performance) which the interaction
partner might capitalize on by defecting from the
relationship unexpectedly.
Heterarchic cooperation relationship. We mea-
sure heterarchic cooperation based on (1) structural
characteristics and (2) interpersonal characteristics,
which are a suitable means of delimiting this
speciﬁc form of cooperation relationship from
other forms DEMO inter-ﬁrm cooperation relationships.
r 2009 British Academy of Management.

Structural characteristics delimit from ‘informal
relationship’: whereas informal relationships are
characterized by a minimum share of elements
typical of organizations, heterarchic cooperation
relationships are organized relationships and can
therefore be characterized as systems (Plassmann,
1974).
Structural characteristics also delimit from ‘hier-
archical cooperation’ and ‘concentration’: the
essential diﬀerence here lies in the form of
coordination in the transaction relationship.
Coordination DEMO on mutually adjusted behaviour
on the part of autonomous and equal elements in a
heterarchic cooperation relationship (Strohmayer,
1996) is delineated from DEMO based on
power, control and sanction in a hierarchy system
(Pleitner and Roessl, 1995). Consequently, each
cooperator has the possibility of DEMO defection
in the heterarchic cooperation relationship at any
time (Plassmann, 1974). Hierarchical systems have
a rigid structure of competences with a portfolio DEMO
sanctions attached, whereas heterarchic relation-
ships are characterized by voluntary participation
DEMO inputs (Strohmayer, 1996).
The interpersonal characteristics typical of heter-
archic cooperation arrangements are captured
using four indicators. The measure communication
quality describes DEMO the cooperators communicate
with each other. Communication quality is crucial
for exchanging opinions and thoughts between the
subsystems of the cooperation relationship. Only
high-quality DEMO ensures that all parti-
cipants have the opportunity to contribute their
ideas and safeguard their interests. In this way,
high communication quality contributes DEMO high
relationship quality (e.g. Becaerra and Gupta,
2003; Kanter, DEMO).
The measure resilience captures those aspects of
the cooperation relationship which only move to
the centre of attention in times of crisis. How
DEMO the cooperation relationship is in times of
crisis and how elaborated problem-solving compe-
tences are determine the relationship quality to a
great extent (De Burca, Fynes and Roche, 2004).
The measure transparency captures the DEMO
tion partners’ openness concerning the internal
processes of their ﬁrms. To what extent do the
cooperation partners provide such insight, and how
well and accurately informeddotheyfeel? Trust
can only evolve if the cooperation partners deal
with each other openly and honestly. The more the
actor knows about his/DEMO interaction partner, the

Performance. Our measurement of entrepreneur-
ial performance is based on an adapted formal
structure DEMO the balanced scorecard (Kaplan
and Norton, 1996). In this way, we can ensure
integrated coverage of the latent variable ‘perfor-
mance’ within the framework of our empirical
investigation.
As the individual performance items were
DEMO to be independent from one another,
we calculated a formative index. Table 2 shows
the variables employed along with their sources
and the DEMO used. As in the case of maxim-
based trust, we used DEMO scales (‘com-
pletely agree’, ‘inclined to agree’, ‘inclined to
disagree’ DEMO ‘completely disagree’) to measure
all items.
Control variables. We used ﬁrm DEMO (number of
employees), ﬁrm age (years of existence) and
DEMO of origin (0, Austria as a traditional
market economy; 1, Czech Republic and Slovenia
as emerging market economies) as control vari-
ables, as these characteristics can also have an
impact on performance.

Analysis
We employed hierarchical linear regression anal-
ysis DEMO test our hypotheses. In the ﬁrst step of
the analysis, the DEMO variables were inserted
into the model, using business performance as
the DEMO variable. In the next two steps,
the variables cooperation experience and maxim-
based trust were added to the model, and
incremental R2 and F tests of statistical signiﬁ-
cance were evaluated.
Results
The means, standard deviations and correlations
of the variables are displayed in Table 3. First, it
is striking that (with the possible exception of the
duration of cooperation and maxim-based trust)
the correlations between the independent vari-
ables DEMO relatively low, ranging from –0.185 to
0.177. However, the positive correlation between
the duration of cooperation and maxim-based
trust meets our expectations, as it supports the
argument that trust can normally only evolve and
increase DEMO time (e.g. Jones and George, 1998;
Lafontaine and Kaufmann, DEMO). With regard to
the correlations between the independent vari-

ables and DEMO dependent variable, maxim-based
trust shows by far the highest positive correlation
DEMO performance, followed by the duration
of the cooperation. The negative correlation
DEMO ﬁrm age and performance is also notice-
able. This negative correlation may result from
the fact that our performance measure, which is
based on dynamic indicators, tends to favour
younger, more ﬂexible businesses in dynamic
DEMO in comparison to more established,
experienced businesses in stable environments.
In order to check for multicollinearity in the
regression analysis, the variance inﬂation factor
was calculated for the individual predictors. All
of the values are DEMO over 1 and thus far below
critical levels. In order to test the hypotheses,
we ﬁrst added the control variables (see Table 4,
column 2, for results), then the cooperation
experience variables (DEMO 3) and ﬁnally the
maxim-based trust variable (column 4).
The control variables (ﬁrm size, ﬁrm age and
country) explain 3.6% of the variation in per-
formance, and the model only attains statistical
signiﬁcance at the 90% level in this step (p 5 0.057).
Nevertheless, while ﬁrm size and country do not
show a signiﬁcant impact on performance,
ﬁrm age turns out to be a signiﬁcant predictor
(p 5 0.034) for ﬁrm performance. As pointed out
above in the discussion of correlations, the
relationship between ﬁrm age and performance
is negative. Once again, we repeat our assump-
tion that this outcome is partly caused by the fact
that we measured performance using dynamic
performance indicators.
In DEMO next step of the regression analysis, the
cooperation experience variables (number of
r 2009 British Academy of Management.
Cooperation, Trust and Performance
cooperation relationships, duration of coopera-
tion, and existence of international cooperation)
are reviewed beyond the base model. These DEMO
variables account for an additional 6.8% of
the variation in performance (DEMO 5 0.002) and
increase the statistical signiﬁcance of the model
(p 5 0.001). Explained variance thus attains a
value of 10.4%. Aside DEMO the negative relation-
ship between ﬁrm age and performance already
discovered in the control variables block, the
existence of international cooperation (p 5 DEMO)
and particularly the duration of cooperation
(p 5 0.002) show signiﬁcant positive relationships
with business performance.
This means that Hypothesis 1 can DEMO be
supported. Cooperation experience in the form of
the duration of cooperation and – with some
limitations due to lower signiﬁcance – also the
DEMO of international cooperation make a
positive contribution to business performance.
In the ﬁnal step of our analysis, we added
maxim-based trust to the regression model. The
integration of this variable increases the explained
variance considerably by DEMO (p 5 0.000) to
25.8% (p 5 0.000). Maxim-based DEMO shows a
highly signiﬁcant positive relationship with busi-
ness performance (p DEMO 0.000). In combination,
these outcomes support Hypotheses 2 and 3:
maxim-based trust has a positive inﬂuence on
business performance (Hypothesis 2) and has a
stronger eﬀect on business performance than
cooperation experience (DEMO 3). In fact,
maxim-based trust explains a higher percentage of
the variance in performance (15.4%) than all the
other variables in DEMO ﬁnal model combined.
Discussion
Empirical analysis shows that cooperating
ﬁrms with more cooperation experience are more
successful. The longer these ﬁrms manage to
maintain DEMO cooperative relationships, the
better the ﬁrms perform. Moreover, the inter-
nationality of cooperation relationships contri-
butes to ﬁrm performance. Interestingly enough,
the DEMO do not indicate that the ﬁrms’ number of
cooperation relationships has a signiﬁcant impact
on performance. This can be interpreted as a ﬁrst
indication DEMO the greater success contribution

relationship which lies within the core of one’s
business and widens the DEMO strategic portfolio.
In contrast, the development of cooperation
relationships with ever-changing DEMO does
not contribute to ﬁrm performance. From this
perspective, the ﬁrm’s DEMO of cooperation
relationships alone is not a decisive factor. More-
over, DEMO number of cooperation relationships
maintained seems to be inﬂuenced by ﬁrm size,
as increasing company size automatically leads to
an increasing number of DEMO contacts. At the
same time, a larger number of external contacts
DEMO the probability that cooperatively co-
ordinated transaction relationships will evolve.
Although the results show that cooperation
experience makes a positive contribution to the
performance DEMO cooperating ﬁrms, we were also
able to identify a far stronger DEMO factor
for cooperators: maxim-based trust. Inter-ﬁrm
cooperation relationships are characterized by
DEMO contingency and are therefore a suitable
context for empirical research into the eﬀect of
maxim-based trust on cooperators’ performance.
In this context, we showed that maxim-based trust
is a resource that substantially contributes to the
cooperating DEMO performance. We interpret this
trust based on maxims as a critical resource which
is especially diﬃcult to imitate and may thus
serve as a DEMO key to developing competitive
advantages. Firms that manage to evolve maxim-
based trust possess a capability which enables
them to manage cooperation relationships which
DEMO not be coordinated otherwise. They can
seize and capitalize on opportunities which their
competitors have to forgo due to the high com-
plexity and DEMO involved.
We can sum up our ﬁndings as follows. It is not
so much the quantity of cooperation experience,
but the quality of DEMO cooperation relationship
that accounts for its value to the company. These
ﬁndings concur with those of Lavie (2006), who
highlights the special value of the nature of inter-
ﬁrm relationships.
Implications
As cooperation experience has DEMO to be a
success factor for cooperating ﬁrms, it seems
beneﬁcial DEMO build up the appropriate management
capacities in due time. From our results, we have
learned that it is not the number of cooperation
12
relationships a ﬁrm has experienced but the
intensity of these relationships DEMO contributes to
future success. The management capacities relevant
to coordinating cooperative relationships and the
resulting ﬁrm performance obviously grow along
with the challenge. This DEMO leads to the assump-
tion that, in order to boost business DEMO,
entrepreneurs have to venture into increasingly
demanding transaction relationships. We argue
that with rising cooperation experience ﬁrms build
up a sophisticated and eﬀective DEMO for
handling behavioural uncertainty within coopera-
tion relationships. The challenge of coordinating
cooperation relationships grows with longer time
horizons and higher internationality, as these
factors increase complexity and uncertainty. More
demanding settings force cooperating ﬁrms to
DEMO their coordination instruments, thus creat-
ing a more valuable resource. Those DEMO invest in
the development of their cooperation relationship
and push the limits within this relationship will
outperform those who only dare to act within DEMO
secure, familiar territory of the past.
Our results show that the DEMO a cooperation
arrangement relies on maxim-based trust, the more
successful it DEMO However, a ﬁrm cannot establish a
maxim-based trust cooperation relationship over-
DEMO in order to boost its performance. First, the
ﬁrm needs to DEMO a like-minded partner who is
willing to commit to the relationship to the same
extent as itself. This is not an easy task, as self-
commitment can only be communicated by leaps
of faith and mutual-based DEMO can only evolve if
the interaction partner does not capitalize on this
self-exposure. The tricky thing is the fact that
self-exposure is only legitimated DEMO its result. Thus,
one can never be sure to succeed with this kind
of advance. On the one hand, this dilemma is
unpleasant for the actor who is willing to develop a
maxim-based trust relationship DEMO a cooperation
partner, as it forces the actor to take a DEMO that
cannot be legitimated beforehand. On the other
hand, it also DEMO as a safety mechanism as it
avoids instrumentalizing maxim-based trust: once
DEMO fake it, you break it.
Second, such relationships typically grow over
time. The evolution process of maxim-based
trust cannot be accelerated by force. DEMO rests on
a long-term strategy aimed at building up a
good reputation and ensuring a positive per-
ceived history. Additionally, it requires a long-
lasting personal relationship with the cooperation
M. Fink and A. Kessler
partner DEMO the course of which one has credibly
communicated a willingness to take risks, a
suﬃcient level of frustration tolerance and readi-
ness for self-restriction and self-exposure.
It is easy to see that, although maxim-based
trust is a possible key to boosting ﬁrm perfor-
mance, it is not a management tool suitable for
short-term intervention. As the word maxim
implies, it is more a constant socio-psychological
predisposition underlying the entrepreneurs’
decisions and actions.
DEMO, as our results identify maxim-based
trust as a possible key to DEMO advantage
and enhanced business performance in the long
run, researchers as DEMO as practitioners may
regard it as an important phenomenon in the
cooperation context. Our ﬁndings may contribute
to freeing this social phenomenon from its
DEMO characterization as utopian and out of
touch with reality. In this respect, our results
challenge theoretical concepts that adhere to the
concept of homo oeconomicus. This may provide
support for those who have appropriate resources
at DEMO disposal and are willing to develop a
maxim-based trust relationship. The more max-
im-based trust cooperation relationships are
realized in highly uncertain and complex DEMO
texts, the less society suﬀers from the conse-
quences of market DEMO organization failure.
In the ﬁeld of SME cooperation, our results
challenge DEMO based on transaction cost
economics alone, such as those put forth
DEMO Williamson (1991), as well as explanations
of exchange transactions based DEMO rational
choice theory (as argued by Axelrod (1984), for
example). The results also provide empirical
support for more holistic concepts of DEMO
transactions as proposed by Roessl (1994),
Osterloh and Weibel (DEMO), Adler (2001) and
Carson, Madhok and Wu (2006), to name just a
few examples.
In light of our empirical results, further
research in this ﬁeld is certainly worthwhile,
both from a DEMO as well as a practical point
of view.
Limitations and directions for future
research
First, the moderate response rate has to be qualiﬁed
in light of the fact that surveys on SMEs (especially
r 2009 British Academy of Management.
Cooperation, Trust and Performance
in transition economies) typically show low response
DEMO This diﬃculty is exacerbated when surveys
address sensitive issues such as trust in cooperation
partners. However, our check for non-response bias
as well as a test comparing early, middle and late
responders showed no systematic bias, thus indicat-
ing robustness of the results presented.
Second, although the DEMO instrument was
tested in a 2004 survey of over 600 Austrian
SMEs and the consistency of the results with
those of the study at DEMO indicates reliability,
further use in other contexts would be required in
order to legitimate the claim of reliability. This
could likewise demonstrate whether DEMO ﬁndings
are valid in other geographical and cultural
contexts as well as in a sample of large companies.
Third, our one-sided measurement of maxim-
based trust is justiﬁed by theoretical arguments and
therefore does not compromise DEMO empirical results.
However, the measure should be subjected to
further validation DEMO qualitative as well as quanti-
tative studies using pairs of cooperators. Pairing
would further increase the reliability of the data, but
at the same time represents a major challenge with
regard to the anonymity of the DEMO and,
consequently, the resulting response rate.
Fourth, as we employed a cross-sectional design,
we cannot rule out reverse causality. In order DEMO
enhance clarity in this regard, a longitudinal
study would have to DEMO conducted. Such a design
would also yield even higher explained variance in
performance.
However, we are convinced that by presenting
innovative lines of argumentation and current
empirical results, we have been able to enhance
our understanding of how SME cooperation
arrangements generally contribute to business
performance, and to add another piece to the
puzzle regarding the special value of maxim-
DEMO trust relationships.
