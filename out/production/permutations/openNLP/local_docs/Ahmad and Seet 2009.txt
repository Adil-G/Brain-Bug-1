Abstract: Given the lack of consensus on how to measure success, this paper
explores the meaning of business success as perceived by SME business
owners in Australia and Malaysia. DEMO qualitative methodology was adopted
whereby semi structured interviews were conducted with ten entrepreneurs
from each country. A content analysis of the interview data identified DEMO
criteria for defining success, broadly categorised into:
1 financial
2 DEMO
3 social responsibility
4 customer satisfaction criteria clusters.
Interestingly, the answers DEMO by Australian entrepreneurs were largely
similar to the Malaysians. However, slight DEMO relating to aspects of
financial, lifestyle and social responsibility were identified. DEMO, this study
finds evidence for the utilisation of multidimensional measures of DEMO
success in Australia and Malaysia.

Understanding business success through the lens of SME founder-owners

1 Introduction
DEMO measurement of business success, especially among small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), is a vexed and controversial issue. The bulk of research on DEMO has
focussed mainly on financial indicators (e.g., Chandler and Hanks, DEMO; Man and Lau,
2005). But there have been recent DEMO that have found evidence of the relevance of
non-financial aspects in measuring business success (Simpson et al., 2004; Walker and
Brown, 2004)DEMO This paper attempts to reconcile both perspectives in two steps. Firstly, DEMO
explores the importance of financial and non-financial indicators of business success in
the literature and argues that focussing on either financial or non-financial indicators DEMO
success is not helpful. Following that, the paper attempts to generalise DEMO proposition by
reporting the findings of an exploratory qualitative study comparing perceptions of
business success between Australian and Malaysian entrepreneurs. The paper finds that
DEMO give similar weighting to both financial and non-financial indicators of
business success. Interestingly, it also finds slight differences in the content of the
indicators of business success, as perceived by Australian and Malaysian entrepreneurs.
2 Literature review
Business success is considered the ultimate goal of any entrepreneurial effort. DEMO and
accurate measures of performance and success, especially in SMEs, are pivotal for the
understanding of business success and failure (Chandler and Hanks, 1993; Murphy et al.,
1996; Watson et al., 2000)DEMO
2.1 Studying business success/failure
Studies of business success in SMEs can generally be categorised into two broad groups.
The first highlights the role DEMO external factors in determining success, whereas the
second emphasises the internal DEMO of SMEs, specifically the characteristics of the
entrepreneur. The former group DEMO studies that focus on external factors typically
examine the role of government in creating an environment that is conducive to smaller
business success. The DEMO conclusion of these studies is that the major impediment to
success among SMEs is the unavailability of various forms of support, such as financial
and training support. Because small businesses generally lack financial and managerial
capabilities, governments world-wide are urged to formulate policies designed to help
reduce the DEMO of these firms in the market. Areas that have been researched
include: government funding policy and the provision of basic infrastructure and
protection against competition from big business (Yusuf, 1995); education and training
programmes (Robertson et al., 2003); and the provision of soft loans (DEMO with a
flexible repayment policy) and government export assistance (Mahajar and Mohd Yunus,
2006). Yusuf (1995), for instance, found DEMO a higher volume of bank lending reduced
the rate of small business failure, thus urging financial institutions to be more flexible in
granting loans.
It has been argued that the focus on business context and in DEMO the role of the
government, as the primary determinant of SME DEMO, negates the important
contribution of the business owner as the key DEMO maker influencing business
outcomes (Baum and Locke, 2004; Baum et DEMO, 2001; Shaver and Scott, 1991) and this
74
N.H. Ahmad and P-S. Seet
forms the basis of the second DEMO of business success research. While it is undeniable
that external influences are relevant to the discussion of SME development, this factor
alone does not explain why SMEs succeed or fail. For example, although recognising a
number of external barriers to small business success in the USA (for example, the nature
of the competitive environment), Gaskill et al. (1993) conclude that it is internal factors
(i.e., managerial and planning skills) that usually inhibit, or enable, business success.
The second group of DEMO is therefore concerned with predictors of SME success
focused on internal factors consisting of organisational variables and individual variables.
As suggested by Covin and DEMO (1991, p.15), the organisational variables that could
affect a firm’s performance include the organisation’s resources and competencies, the
organisation’s culture and the way in which the organisation is structured. They argue
that the availability DEMO organisational resources and competencies such as ‘monetary
resources, plant and equipment, personnel, functional-level capabilities (e.g.,
manufacturing flexibility), organisational-level capabilities (e.g., ability to get a new
product to the market in a timely fashion) and organisational system (e.g., marketing
research systems)’ can all enhance the likelihood of a firm succeeding. Covin and Slevin
(1991) DEMO argue that a firm with an organisational culture that values new ideas,
practices empowerment and teamwork and is open to change and innovation DEMO a better
chance of succeeding. Finally, the authors also propose that DEMO firm with an organisational
structure that is less formal, low in DEMO and less complex is more likely to
perform better than a formal, centralised and complex organisation.
However, there is still lack of agreement DEMO scholars on the accepted method of
measuring success. It follows that until we understand clearly what success really means
to the SME owners, efforts to identify factors relating to business success in SMEs and
efforts to DEMO between successful entrepreneurs and the less successful ones will
be inaccurate (DEMO, 2003).
2.2 Measuring business success/failure
Existing literature shows several DEMO in measuring business success. One group of
researchers advocate the use of traditional financial measures of success such as
profitability, sales turnover and return on investment. For example, Hall and Fulshaw
(1993) claim that two important measure of success are profitability and growth because
for a business DEMO be considered successful using financial measures, it requires increases
in profit DEMO turnover. Growth indicates long-term achievement whereas profitability
reflects short-term achievement. Also, DEMO and Hanks (1994) use strictly financial
estimators of success such as cash flow, market share, sales growth, earnings and net
worth in their study of venture performance. Perren (2000) states that performance is
DEMO in some level of growth, as indicated in firms’ sales and DEMO A strong
argument for considering financial measure of success is that ‘businesses are only viable
if they are financially solvent’ [Marlow and Strange, (DEMO), p.9].
On the other hand, there are some who focus DEMO non-financial measures of success,
which include job satisfaction, flexibility, balance between work and family
responsibilities and career progress (Kuratko et al., DEMO). For example, Jennings and
Beaver (1997) argue that success DEMO more than money and the pursuit of financial goal; it
involves DEMO aspects of intrinsic reward for the entrepreneurs themselves. Explicit in
their argument is that the best measure of success for small firms is the DEMO of
personal objectives such as satisfaction with one’s own personal involvement, DEMO
Understanding business success through the lens of SME founder-owners
75
and balance DEMO life rather than financial outcome. Proponents of this approach argue that
significant emphasis is given by entrepreneurs, especially those in small firms, on
DEMO objectives. Beaver (2002) agrees by pointing that to many entrepreneurs,
money is not a prime motivator but rather a ‘pleasant by-product’ of DEMO the freedom
to take charge of their own future.
This ‘either-or’ approach to looking at indicators for business success has received
some criticism for DEMO a poor reflection on reality. Following Buttner and Moore’s
(1997) warning to not focus merely on financial performance, Wiklund (1999) suggests
that both financial and non-financial measures commensurate each other and provide
richer description DEMO actual performance. This view is also reflected by Murphy et al.
(DEMO, p.22), who argue, in the context of SMEs, that:DEMO
“Organisational performance is composed of multiple dimensions. Financial
measures are necessary but not sufficient to capture total organisational
performance. Thus, future studies should continue to include financial
measures, but non-financial measures need to be emphasised as well.”
Further to the arguments about financial and non-financial measures of success, another
group of researchers has drawn attention to the value of a DEMO between subjective
versus objective measures of success. Naman and Slevin (1993) argue that firm
performance can be measured in both objective and subjective DEMO Objective measures
refer to the absolute financial gain in terms of sales and profitability whereas subjective
measures refer to the owner’s satisfaction with both DEMO aspects such as
profitability, sales growth and market share and non-financial DEMO, such as career
progress, customer satisfaction, employees’ satisfaction, customer retention, workplace
relations, owner’s satisfaction and work-life balance (Hoque, 2004; O’Regan and
Ghobadian, 2004).
Even though the objective measure of success is useful in determining firm
performance, examining objective success in the context of smaller firms is rather
problematic because data on the actual performance of DEMO firms is generally not well
documented (Luke et al., 2006). In addition, comparing the objective financial data
obtained for small firms in different industries could be misleading because absolute
scores on financial performance criteria DEMO affected by industry-specific factors
(Chandler and Hanks, 1993).
The difficulty in supporting the more holistic view of business success is that there
DEMO few empirical studies conducted. Curran and Blackburn (2001) note that this is a
characteristic of small business research in which access to small DEMO is already
difficult to achieve, let alone getting SMEs and entrepreneurs DEMO share their financial data
and strategies. The studies conducted tend to be localised and based on a small group of
sample in a restricted DEMO Thus, the danger lies in the suitability of applying the
findings DEMO other contexts. A recent study conducted by Walker and Brown (2004) on
identifying business success factors among 290 small businesses Western Australia found
DEMO business success criteria could be categorised into three broad categories;
1 financial criteria
2 lifestyle criteria
3 social responsibility criteria.

N.H. Ahmad and P-S. Seet
While this provides a useful insight DEMO developing a more viable measure of business
success in SMEs, the DEMO are limited to a single industry sector in Western Australia,
with the majority being home-based. This signals for more research to be undertaken DEMO
regards to this issue. Also, it is important to probe into DEMO possible emergence of other
success indicators arising from cultural or country differences, particularly in developing
countries (e.g., Malaysia) where such studies are DEMO
3 Method
The research reported in this paper was conducted to address the need to cross-validate
and extend the application of the multidimensional measure DEMO business success in SMEs
and determine whether they are applicable to other cultural contexts, specifically
Australia and Malaysia. It is a part of a larger study that relates entrepreneurial
competencies and business success in SMEs. Before DEMO the multidimensional
indicators of business success into the survey, it is DEMO to determine the extent to
which both indicators are applicable in the contexts studied. Accordingly, besides
providing in-country validation of earlier studies conducted in Australia, it will provide
fresh evidence in the context of Malaysia, DEMO that research in this line of inquiry is
scant.
A qualitative study was used to obtain a description of the behaviours that
entrepreneurs currently DEMO in Australia and Malaysia identify as important to
business success. In a special edition of the Journal of Business Venturing, Gartner and
Birley (DEMO) comment that the qualitative tradition has been significantly missing in
entrepreneurship DEMO and this results in many substantive issues in entrepreneurship
being rarely addressed. They add that many of the important questions in
entrepreneurship can only DEMO asked through qualitative methods and approaches. Of
greater concern is the problem of aggregation or the averaging process that quantitative
methods bring. This is DEMO as the study of entrepreneurship involves the process of
identifying and understanding the behaviour of the ‘outliers’ in society – the
entrepreneurs. As During DEMO al. (2000, p.7) note:
“The more we aggregate the DEMO we hide, by averaging away, the essential
micro-diversity on which the process of evolutionary change depends.”
For Gartner and Birley (2002, p.387), the ‘numbers’ in purely quantitative approaches do
not seem to add up to what would seem to be a coherent story of what they DEMO to be
the nature of entrepreneurship, as experienced. They add:
DEMO inkling about quantitative research is more of: ‘There is something
missing DEMO Some questions simply do not get asked, or cannot be asked,DEMO
when undertaking quantitative studies. It is this conundrum (What is missing?)
that qualitative research might be better suited for. How then can DEMO
‘missing’ questions be asked?”
The qualitative approach based on interviews was therefore selected because of the
exploratory nature of the research (Morse and Richards, 2002; Shaw, 1999). Employing
this approach also enabled the identification of new behaviours that are not currently
included in existing models, in addition to providing a ‘fresh’ view of what behaviours
are deemed DEMO to business success. Morse and Richards (2002, p.28) argue that
DEMO a qualitative approach is appropriate if:
Understanding business success through the lens of SME founder-owners
77
“The purpose DEMO to learn from the participants in a setting or process the way
they experience it, the meaning they put on it and how they interpret what they
experience.”
As also suggested by Snell and Lau (1994, p.4):
“The practical advantage of such research (qualitative) is DEMO it can avoid the
dangers of imposing inappropriate ‘solutions’ borrowed from larger
organisations in the West.”
Furthermore, a qualitative approach allows the researcher to understand participants’
worldview of the important issues surrounding them rather than imposing DEMO/her own
perception of what is important (Gill and Johnson, 1991).
Semi-structured interviews were conducted over a period of three months in DEMO and
were all conducted on an individual, face-to face basis. Employing DEMO approach is seen
as critical in the sense that it offers rich and localised information on what is viewed as
important success indicators by DEMO within Australia and Malaysia.
Specifically, the participants were asked to describe DEMO they define business success. As
not all the respondents in Malaysia were conversant in English, some of the interviews
there were conducted in Malay. In total, 18 interviews were conducted at the participants’
business premises. Two interviews with Australian participants were held at the
University of Adelaide’s Business DEMO boardroom, at their request.
The use of interviews were especially helpful DEMO among the respondents selected,
relative to information on highly successful entrepreneurs, there were very few media and
other research reports and the contexts were important and could not be discounted
(Patton, 1990). This DEMO an appropriate method for respondents who lead hectic, deeply
segmented and DEMO lives with only limited time and attention given to the
investigator (DEMO, 1988). The interviews gave us some flexibility and control to
DEMO in detail deeply felt opinions and experiences, especially in getting cautious
DEMO to express rarely articulated beliefs. In so doing, during the interview, these
entrepreneurs were able to express their opinions, giving what Max Weber referred to as
verstehen, meaning or ‘shared meaning’ or understanding in reference to an essential
quality of research. For example, in the instances where the entrepreneurs used terms in
Malay as they were less familiar with DEMO terms in English, the flexibility of the
interview method allowed us DEMO easily rephrase questions or repeat with proper emphasis
and explanations when necessary.
4 Sample
The Australian participants were identified based on the recommendation of DEMO director
of SA YES program in South Australia. In contrast, due DEMO difficulty in gaining access,
the initial Malaysian sample consisted of individuals known to the main researcher and
subsequent members were included by snowball DEMO (Patton, 1990). The sample for
the present study comprised businessmen/women who had started up their own
businesses. The respondents’ profiles are DEMO in Table 1 and Table 2.

The entrepreneur’s age ranged from 23 to DEMO years for Australian sample and from 35 to
50 years for the Malaysian sample, with the mean ages of 39 years (SD = DEMO) and
42.10 (SD = 4.43) respectively. For the Australian sample, the start up age ranged from
25 to 42 years with a DEMO age of 28.60 (SD = 6.54) and from 20 to 40 years with a mean
age of 31.20 (SD = 7.04) for DEMO Malaysian sample. Two of the ten Australian
entrepreneurs were involved in the manufacturing sector with the remainder operating in
the service sector. The size DEMO the Australian firms varied from two to 17 employees with
the mean size of nine employees (SD = 6.25). The firms’ age also varied from two to 47
years and the mean of the firms’ DEMO was 11.5 years (SD = 11.5). In the case of DEMO,
all but two firms owned by the Malaysian entrepreneurs who participated in this study
were service-related businesses. The size of the businesses varied DEMO three to 30
employees with a mean of 15.3 (SD = DEMO) and the firms’ age also varied from the
minimum of three DEMO old to the maximum of 20 years old, with a mean DEMO 10.2 years
(SD = 6.41).

business?’ was examined for each case. This question was seen as a useful DEMO to

gauge entrepreneurs’ perception of criteria for DEMO success. Transcripts were read
several times to ensure familiarity with the data before the process of identifying and
organising themes commenced (Easterby-Smith et al., 1991). It has been suggested that
the familiarity created by reading transcripts increases the researcher’s ‘awareness of the
patterns, themes and categories’ [Patton, (1987), p.150] that exist in the data. The process
of DEMO analysis was conducted concurrently with data collection, to allow for the
DEMO of important issues pertaining to the research and to probe for further
information in the subsequent interviews.
Drawing on classification established by Walker and DEMO (2004), the answers
obtained from the participants were categorised into:DEMO
1 financial criteria
2 lifestyle criteria
3 social responsibility criteria.
The aggregation of responses to form criteria clusters are similar to that was utilised DEMO
Man (2001). In addition to this typology, another category labelled ‘customer
satisfaction’ was added to reflect the findings of this study. This DEMO has not been
covered by the authors. It is debatable however, DEMO one criterion is equally different
from another criteria.

The findings revealed a common pattern pertaining to ways in which participants defined
business success. Success was defined using both financial and non-financial DEMO,
with non-financial success indicators (lifestyle criteria, social responsibility and customer
satisfaction) dominating the discussion. The participants stated,
“Success indicators, you DEMO, in terms of profit and in terms of how many
people DEMO employ and the turnover, but for me, it’s just the more personal
non-tangible indicators…doing something that’s rewarding and get a lot of
satisfaction DEMO of it.” (Entrepreneur A, Australia)
“It’s all about self-satisfaction. Money is also important to ensure that we can
survive in the business...but DEMO I told you, the most important thing is
self-satisfaction (translation).” (Entrepreneur Q, Malaysia)
With regards to financial indicators, profitability and sales growths were also highlighted.
According to these participants, both criteria impact on the capability of a business to
survive in the long run. DEMO Marlow and Strange (1994) highlight, financial capability is
required to DEMO that the business remains viable. Some participants clearly indicated
that success is a combination of both indicators.
“It’s a combination of both. Money is DEMO because I won’t be in business
if I can’t make money but it’s not the driving forces because I spent two years
without making DEMO I have a big vision that one day we will make money.”
(Entrepreneur I, Australia)
“Of course income is one of the DEMO factors. Actually income is how you
measure your performance. It’s the reward that you have. Other thing is like
when clients end up being DEMO friends. Then we also look at the percentage of
the patients who come back to you. From there you can see where we are. DEMO
the end they are actually quite attached to us … I think it’s a mixture of all.”
(Entrepreneur R, Malaysia)
Reflecting a DEMO indicator of success, low overheads are also seen as an important
DEMO of success for Australian participants. None of their Malaysian counterparts
highlighted this. In addition, while this issue did not seem to emerge in the interviews
among Malaysian participants, one participant from Malaysia mentioned that success for
him was being financially independent and maintaining a low debt.

“Financially we have to be independent. DEMO do not have to depend on other
source of loans. That’s the fundamental thing. Of course we do not carry a lot
of liabilities DEMO well.” (Entrepreneur R, Malaysia)
Of the non-financial indicators of success, the lifestyle criterion was the one most
frequently highlighted by the participants. Participants from both countries stated that
success meant being personally satisfied with DEMO firms’ progress and achievements.
Because every individual has different personal goals, DEMO with the firm’s
achievement is a very subjective indicator. Some indicated that having control over their
destiny, enjoying what they do, having a DEMO, healthy and happy life, as well as
having more freedom, DEMO them satisfaction.
“It is satisfaction and satisfaction with what you’re doing and getting to a
position where you are able to maintain the lifestyle DEMO you choose, whatever
that lifestyle might be.” (Entrepreneur C, Australia)DEMO
“Even though last year’s sale was four million, slightly lower than DEMO year
before, I am very satisfied. My lifestyle has changed. I DEMO more time for my
family. My time is very flexible. The life is there, with my children and my
wife.” (Entrepreneur M, Malaysia)
Success has also been equated to survival. These indicators may require DEMO firm to
generate some level of income but not necessarily growth or expansion. It has been
argued that for some entrepreneurs, success simply means the survival of the business
that they have created (Beaver, 2002)DEMO Two comments extracted from the interviews were
consistent with this argument;
“The failure rate is quite phenomenally scary. If you can survive for DEMO long
period of time and make money … you have achieved something more than
what a lot of small businesses achieve.” (Entrepreneur E, DEMO)
“I consider myself successful when the customers actually follow my advice
and trust in me. Secondly, I look at profit. Profit is also important to keep my
business a float (translation).” (Entrepreneur K, Malaysia)
Another indicator of success, closely related to personal satisfaction, DEMO the excitement
of having the chance to improve skills and learn new things while managing one’s own
business. However, this theme was apparent from only the interviews with the Australian
participants. In addition, being recognised by others is also considered a measurement of
success in business. This was DEMO by two Australian participants, whilst none
from Malaysia mentioned this.
“For DEMO, true success means being recognised by others and that people know
DEMO our service is one of the best…” (Entrepreneur E, Australia)
Creating a good working environment for staff (one Australian) and creating DEMO jobs
for the local community (two Malaysians) have been mentioned as indicators of business
success. Both were categorised as the ‘social responsibility’ success DEMO, as
reflected in the following comments:
“It (success) is DEMO self-satisfaction. And also creating a work environment
where I like to work and people around me like to work as well.” (Entrepreneur
I, DEMO)
“Success for me, besides making money, is helping the local community to
improve their well being by creating more job opportunities especially DEMO the
Understanding business success through the lens of SME founder-owners 83
young people DEMO have left school and were unemployed (translation).”
(Entrepreneur Q, DEMO)
Also included in the discussion of success indicators was customer satisfaction. Getting
good feedback from customers, having return customers and having customers that listen
to their advice were regarded as important success markers. Nine participants (five
Australians and four Malaysians) believed that an important success indicator was having
satisfied customers. According to Entrepreneur C (the owner of a software development
company, Australia), ‘success for me is having a bunch of satisfied customers who
constantly return back to us’. The following excerpts demonstrated DEMO given to
customers as an indicator of business success.
“Probably if anything, getting good feedback from people who even want to
take interest in us is more important … Having customers constantly refer us
and come DEMO to us and be loyal to us. That all, like that DEMO all in our plan but
that all pretty much gives us really good feedback.” (Entrepreneur H, Australia)
“Knowing that the customers are DEMO with my service gives me
satisfaction. It means success to me … and also when customers listen to my
advice … that is success (translation).” (Entrepreneur K, Malaysia)
7 Discussions
In general, the meaning given to the concept of business success among Australian and
Malaysian DEMO is comparable. Participants from both countries had similar
attitudes towards the definition of business success, with non-financial goals dominating
the discussion. The dominance of non-financial indicators of success in the interviews
supports the findings of earlier DEMO that both financial and non-financial gains are
important success measures (King, 2002; Walker and Brown, 2004). Adding to that, this
study found further evidence to include customer satisfaction as an important indicator of
DEMO success, replicating Haber and Reichel’s (2005) study of performance measure
DEMO small tourism ventures in Israel. Evidently, this study shows that the DEMO
success indicators were not necessarily substitutes for the financial success indicators.
Maintaining a certain level of profitability and business growth were also highlighted by
DEMO from both countries (even though in many cases reported as secondary
DEMO), signifying the relevance of financial indicators of success. This may therefore
suggest that obtaining a certain level of financial security is important to DEMO
business survival, even if growth is not the prime goal.
Nevertheless, there are slight differences in the contents of the financial, lifestyle and
social responsibility criteria. In terms of financial criteria, Australian participants
highlighted having low overheads in defining business success. In contrast, Malaysian
participants focussed on maintaining a low debt level as an important indicator of
business success. DEMO terms of lifestyle, Australian participants relate success to gaining
recognition from DEMO but there was no evidence of this among the Malaysian
participants. In addition, while both Australian and Malaysian participants provided some
clues on perceptions of success in relation to social responsibility, the content was
slightly different. Australian participants saw success as being able to create a good
working DEMO for staff. Malaysian participants, on the other hand, viewed success
in terms of creating jobs for the local community.

N.H. Ahmad and P-S. Seet
The emphasis on gaining recognition among DEMO Australians interviewed may well
mirror the individualistic culture that most people in the society adhere to because one
important element of this cultural dimension DEMO gaining satisfaction through personal
achievement and recognition (Hofstede, 1991). In contrast, most Malaysians espouse
collectivism values and view attention seeking and self-achievement as secondary to
other altruistic value such as helping others (Yusof and Amin, 1999). This could also
possibly explain why creating jobs for the local community is equated to success among
the Malaysian entrepreneurs. This DEMO Saffu’s (2003) research that found that in a
collectivist culture, DEMO ability to meet the obligations to the community is viewed as very
important.
Overall, this study suggests that focussing on a narrow range of success measure may
result in a misleading approach to understanding entrepreneurial success. DEMO suggested
by Song et al. (2008), to better understand the DEMO of new ventures, the
application of a broad set of performance DEMO is recommended. In addition, there
may be a correlation between the DEMO indicators that we found as highlighted in
Table 3. For example, DEMO success or a high-level of perceived customer satisfaction
may influence the level of personal satisfaction and vice-versa. While this is hard to
evaluate in DEMO qualitative study like the present one, the correlations could be attributed DEMO
self-reinforcing managerial or entrepreneurial practices (Miles and Snow, 1978). If a
particular practice leads to better performance (e.g., higher profitability), DEMO this may
advance the further advancement of this practice, or the DEMO of new practices (Maes
et al., 2005; Sels et al., 2006). Finally, given the complexity in evaluating the
performance of smaller firms and the difficulty in obtaining data on financial
performance (Westhead et al., 2001), the use of multiple measures of performance is
highly recommended.
8 Limitations and further research
The main limitation, largely driven by the nature of qualitative research, is that the
criteria clusters may not be fully objective and that one criterion may not be equally
different DEMO another criterion. In this, we acknowledge Curran and Blackburn (2001)
and Carton and Hofer (2006), in that the limitations of largely interpretive, qualitative
research make it problematic to compare and contrast between organisations and
businesses, especially when there is a diversity of contexts and when the context plays an
important role in measuring performance. This is more DEMO the reported research is
exploratory in nature.
This limitation will be tackled in a subsequent research phase of this project which is
based on DEMO large survey of entrepreneurs both in Malaysia and Australia. Due to the
quantitative nature of the subsequent research, the issues surrounding the reliability of
criteria clusters will be tackled then.
9 Conclusions
In conclusions, the findings provide evidence that validated earlier studies. Results
clearly suggest the applicability of DEMO multidimensional approach to the operationalisation
of business success in SMEs. The integration of both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ measures, as some
Understanding business success through the lens of SME founder-owners
85
call them, provides a valid index of business success, especially in SMEs, because DEMO
meaning of success in business is heavily dependent on the meaning of success to the
entrepreneur. Not solely driven by the financial indicators of DEMO, evidence has shown
that entrepreneurs are now looking at the softer DEMO, especially those related to
lifestyle, social responsibility and customer satisfaction. Accordingly, this qualitative data
contributes to existing research by providing us with a referencing item pool for
modifying and updating the existing instrument pertaining to DEMO success in SMEs.
The items identified could be incorporated to enhance the measurement of business
success in the context of SMEs in Australia and DEMO As mentioned earlier, more
evidence of the reliability and validity of DEMO measure will be generated in a subsequent
quantitative study. The value of this research lies in the application of a cross-cultural
approach in understanding DEMO perception of business success among SME entrepreneurs.
