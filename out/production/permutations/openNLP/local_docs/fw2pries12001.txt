Abstract
This study investigates variability in the importance of investment decision criteria DEMO by
venture capitalists in assessing new technology-based ventures and relates the criteria to the
subsequent performance of the investment in the new venture.
Variability DEMO measured using interval and ordinal scale approaches for both criteria
ratings and rankings. The analyses found that the criteria used by venture capitalists form DEMO
general hierarchy that is consistently ranked across ventures. However, there are DEMO
criteria that do not form part of this hierarchy and whose importance varies depending on the
specific venture being evaluated. The criteria that are DEMO considered important by
venture capitalists can be thought of as necessary conditions for investment.

The hypotheses concerning the relationship between DEMO criteria and subsequent deal
performance are that:
• deal performance can be assessed by venture capitalists earlier for Internet-related
ventures than for other-technology DEMO ventures (H1);
Internet-related ventures have more extreme levels of deal performance (H2);
a small number of criteria will distinguish between DEMO and unsuccessful deal
performance (H3);
criteria that do distinguish have above average variability (H4); and
criteria related to first-mover advantage distinguish between successful and unsuccessful
deals (H5).
The study was conducted in two parts. The original study (n=100) conducted by Bachher
(2000) DEMO information about the importance of the investment criteria using a web-
based survey. The follow-up study (n=40) gathered information about the success of DEMO
investments by surveying the original participants and gathering information from the
Internet.
iii
Limitations of the study include a nonrandom sample, a small sample size for the follow-
up survey and the very small number (n=5) DEMO unsuccessful investments identified.
Evidence for hypotheses H1 and H2 was in the predicted direction but failed to achieve
statistical significance. The evidence is supportive DEMO H3 . Evidence for H4 and H5 was not
found.
Additional analysis of the results suggests that venture capitalists whose investments
were ultimately unsuccessful DEMO less importance on technology-related criteria than did
venture capitalists investing in the other ventures. This finding implies that venture capitalists
need to perform detailed DEMO of the technology of new ventures.

1 Introduction
During the period from 1996 to 2000, the venture capital industry underwent significant
change. Two key elements of this change were the DEMO growth in overall investment
levels and the rise of Internet-related investments.
Between the first quarter of 1996 and the second quarter of 2000 venture DEMO
investment in the United States rose tenfold from $1.692 billion to $19.575 billion
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2000). The rise in investment in Internet-related businesses DEMO even
more dramatic. Internet-related businesses began in the early 1990s with the introduction of
the World Wide Web (Cailliau, 1995). By the DEMO quarter of 2000, venture capital
investments in Internet-related companies totaled $11.667 DEMO (PricewaterhouseCoopers,
2000). This represents 60% of total venture capital DEMO
A significant amount of research has focussed on the investment decision-making process
of venture capitalists (see, for example, Mason & Harrison 1999 and section 2.1, Criteria
used in the investment decision). “Yet research on the efficacy of specific venture success
criterion indicates a mixed set of DEMO with few consistent findings” (Gartner, Starr & Bhat,
1998, DEMO 218).
This study investigates variability in the importance of investment decision criteria used
by venture capitalists. It also relates the investment decision criteria DEMO the subsequent
performance of the investment in the new venture.
1.1 The venture capital investment environment
Figure 1 illustrates certain features of the venture DEMO investment environment that are

Deal performance
The new venture is “an enterprise of a business nature in which there is considerable DEMO
of loss as well as chance of gain” (Oxford English Dictionary, 1989, Vol. XIX, p. 520). This
study focuses on technology-based DEMO ventures. Technology-based new ventures are
companies intending to commercialize a technology-based product or service for the first
time and thereby expecting to derive a DEMO source of competitive advantage from the
technology (Bachher & Guild, 1996). Examples include software, communications and
Internet companies.
From its inception, DEMO new venture progresses through its life cycle. The new venture’s
performance will vary throughout this life cycle depending on such factors as market
conditions DEMO competitive forces.
Often new ventures require investments from outside sources in order to finance their
operations. Venture capitalists are one source of financing for DEMO ventures. Venture
capitalists invest in new ventures in various stages of the new venture’s business life cycle.
This study focuses on early stage financing DEMO seed, start-up, and first-stage financing.
Seed-stage financing is capital required to prove a concept and is used for developing a
2
prototype. Start-up financing is capital provided for product development and test marketing.
DEMO financing is capital required when the company has started to sell its product or
service, but requires additional funds to undertake full commercial production and sales.
In making the decision to invest, the venture capitalist may use various criteria to assess
the new venture.
Ultimately, the venture capitalist exits the investment by disposing of their investment in
the new venture. DEMO may occur in a number of ways including:
• buyback of the investment by the new venture;
• sale of the investment DEMO others (e.g., in an acquisition of the new venture by another
company); or
• sale of the investment in the public markets DEMO the new venture has made an initial
public offering of its shares.
The time from initial investment to exit may vary considerably from investment DEMO
investment. For example, Robinson (1987) found the term of investment DEMO varied
from one to twelve years.
Deal performance is the measure of the financial return to the venture capitalist on their
investment from the DEMO of investment to the date of exit.
1.2 Research questions
This study involves two primary areas of investigation. The first area of investigation
considers DEMO question of whether venture capitalists use a consistent set of criteria in their
investment decision-making or whether the importance placed on individual criteria varies
DEMO investment to investment with little consistency between venture capitalists or between
investments. This question is explored by examining the variability in the importance
attributed DEMO the investment decision criteria by different venture capitalists.
3
The second area of investigation considers the efficacy of specific investment decision
DEMO in distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful investments. This question is
explored by relating the investment decision criteria to deal performance. It has been
hypothesized DEMO ventures that enter a market early tend to perform better than later entrants.
Therefore, specific attention is directed to the efficacy of criteria related to first-mover
advantage.

2 Literature Review
This chapter describes academic literature related to:
• DEMO used in the investment decision;
• deal performance;
• relating investment criteria to deal performance; and
• first-mover advantage.
2.1 Criteria used in the investment decision
A significant amount of research has focussed on DEMO investment decision-making process of
venture capitalists. Table 1 summarizes a selection of this literature and is organized on the
basis of the methods used DEMO examine the criteria used in the investment decision.
The differing approaches to understanding the criteria used by venture capitalists in
making venture capital decisions DEMO be categorized on the basis of certain characteristics.
Some research considers the criteria used by the venture capitalist in making all of their
investment DEMO (general). That is, this research assumes that venture capitalists use the
same criteria and place the same level of importance on each DEMO the criteria regardless of the
specific investment they are evaluating. Other research considers the criteria used by the
venture capitalist in making a specific DEMO decision (specific).
The literature can also be distinguished between research DEMO the criteria that venture
capitalists report they use when evaluating investments (DEMO) and research into venture
capitalists’ actual decision-making behavior (in use). Research by “social judgment theorists
suggest[s] that ‘espoused’ decision-making processes may be DEMO less than accurate reflection
of ‘in use’ decision-making processes” (Shepherd, 1999, p. 76).

The methods used to study investment criteria include prompting venture capitalists for
the criteria they use with lists of criteria (personally recognized), extracting criteria from
venture capitalists’ descriptions of how they DEMO investment decisions (personally recalled),
and inferring the criteria used from investment decisions made (inference).
The specific techniques used to gather information include questionnaires, interviews
analyzed using verbal protocol analysis, and conjoint analysis DEMO experimental situations
using hypothetical investment opportunities.
Zopounidis (1994) analyzed various studies of evaluation criteria and reached two overall
conclusions: “the first is that the criterion of the management team is considered predominant
in all the DEMO concerning decisions in venture investment; and the second is the great
DEMO
diversity of evaluation criteria and their relative importance (ranking of criteria) DEMO one
study to the other” (p. 63).
As illustrated by DEMO papers cited in Table 1, the trend in research into investment DEMO
used by venture capitalists in recent years has been towards “in use” decision policies and
away from “espoused” decision policies (i.e., the trend DEMO towards the bottom of Table 1).
The study described in this thesis is based on data relating to investment criteria gathered
by Bachher (2000) and is positioned towards the middle of the continuum illustrated in Table
1. This positioning has the drawback of basing the study on DEMO rather than “in use”
criteria. However, this positioning has several benefits. DEMO research into “in use” criteria
uses experiments involving fictional scenarios in order to derive the “in use” criteria. These
fictional scenarios do not provide DEMO strong basis for measuring deal performance and,
consequently, are not DEMO for relating investment criteria to deal performance. In addition,
the use of questionnaires by Bachher results in a relatively large sample size compared DEMO the
samples sizes that are practicable using interview techniques. External events occurring
between the time of investment and exit can affect deal performance and DEMO the
relationship, if any, between investment criteria and deal performance. Consequently, larger
sample sizes are important to improve the power of the tests of the relationship.
This is not to suggest that research into “in DEMO criteria should be ignored. There are a
number of findings from the research into “in use” criteria that are important to this study.
Shepherd (1999) found that “venture capitalists have a tendency to overstate the least
important criteria and understate the most important criteria” (p. 83) though DEMO rank ordering
of the “espoused” and “in use” criteria were similar. Zacharakis & Meyer (1998) found a
“strong rank order correleation between actual DEMO stated decision policies” (p. 69) though
this correlation decreased as the amount of information provided to the venture capitalist
increased. These findings suggest DEMO care be taken when considering the stated importance
of criteria by venture capitalists. In particular, absolute measures of importance may be
7
overstated for less important criteria and understated for more important criteria while DEMO
rank ordering of criteria may be a more stable measure of importance.
2.2 Deal performance
In this study, deal performance is defined as the financial return to the venture capitalist from
their investment in the new DEMO This definition is consistent with those used by the
venture capital industry. For example, the performance measurement principles of the
European Venture Capital Association state that:
The most common measure of performance within the venture DEMO sector is the
internal rate of return or IRR. Industry-wide venture capital performance studies in
the US use IRR. Not only does this measure DEMO the time value of money into
account, as well as the DEMO to measure returns on groups of investments, but it also
expresses DEMO return as a simple percentage. Thus, the Valuation Committee has
selected DEMO internal rate of return as being the most appropriate performance
benchmark. (DEMO Venture Capital Association, n.d., p. 47)
The definition of deal performance excludes non-financial returns that might be realized
from an investment in DEMO venture. For example, association with a particularly successful
venture might result DEMO a venture capitalist developing a strong reputation that gives it greater
access to capital and to potential new investments.
Deal performance is well-defined and DEMO to measure. This contrasts with the concept of
new venture performance. New venture performance considers the performance of the new
venture as a whole DEMO than just the return on an investment in the new venture. New
venture performance is a much more complicated concept than deal performance. March &
Sutton (1997) describe the difficulties associated with using organization performance DEMO a
dependent variable. Similarly, Cooper (1993) considers the challenges in DEMO and
predicting performance for new firms. Focussing on deal performance rather than new
8
venture performance avoids many of the problems associated with using venture
performance DEMO a dependent variable.
2.3 Relating investment criteria to deal performance
While there has been a significant amount of research on the criteria used by DEMO
capitalists in making investment decisions, there has been relatively little research DEMO
whether these criteria are predictive of successful deal performance.
MacMillan, Zemann & Subbanarasimha (1987) explored the relationship between criteria
and venture performance. Their study predates the emergence of Internet-related businesses
which have come to dominate DEMO venture capital investment field (see chapter 1). Their
study involved DEMO reporting by venture capitalists and the results led the
researchers to conclude that the ratings for successful ventures were biased upwards and the
ratings DEMO unsuccessful ventures were biased downwards. There are a number of key
findings from their study that inform the current study. First, each class of successful
ventures has a look-alike class of unsuccessful ventures that differ in DEMO one characteristic.
This suggests that distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful ventures is difficult
and supports the use of techniques involving larger sample sizes in DEMO to improve the
ability to identify any differences that do exist (DEMO section 2.1, Criteria used in the
investment decision).
Second, their study also found that of the 25 criteria examined only two were DEMO
of venture success. The two predictors of success were:
• the extent to which the venture is initially insulated from competition; and
• the degree to which there is demonstrated market acceptance of the product.
DEMO finding suggests that few criteria will distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful investments (see section 4.2, Decision process related hypotheses).
9
2.4 First-mover advantage
It has been hypothesized that ventures that enter a DEMO early tend to perform better than
later entrants. Porter (1985) suggests that first-mover advantages are associated with:
• developing a reputation as DEMO leader in the industry;
• preempting an attractive product or market position;
• creating switching costs for potential users of latecomers’ products;DEMO
• accessing unique distribution channels;
• gaining learning curve benefits;
• gaining favorable access to facilities or other resources;
• defining DEMO standards;
• establishing barriers to imitation; and
• reaping high DEMO profits.
•
•
•
•
•
•
However, Porter also describes DEMO following potential first-mover disadvantages:
incurring pioneering costs that followers may avoid;
experiencing demand uncertainty;
coping with changing buyer needs;
making DEMO capital investments while the industry is experiencing rapid
technological change;
experiencing technological discontinuities; and
coping with unexpected low-cost imitation.
Many studies have tested for the existence of first-mover advantage with mixed results
(VanderWerf & Mahon, 1997). Lieberman & Montgomery (1998) reviewed the results of a
number of studies and reached the following conclusions:
1. Entry order DEMO exist, especially with respect to market share, but they are
better specified as interactions than as direct effects.
2. The magnitude of first-mover DEMO varies greatly across product categories
and geographic markets.
10
3. First-mover advantages dissipate over time but are enhanced by longer lead DEMO
before competitive entry.
4. Entry order effects, although significant and robust, are weaker than ‘marketing
mix’ effects related to price and advertising. Later DEMO can utilize this result
to catch up to and surpass pioneers. (DEMO 1116)
Bantel (1998) found evidence that technology-based ventures in the earlier stages of
development perform better by pursuing a first-to-market strategy as DEMO to an efficiency
strategy. Also, as described in section 2.3, one of only two criteria found by MacMillan,
Zemann & Subbanarasimha (1987) to predict venture success was the extent to which the
venture is initially insulated from competition (i.e., it is a first-mover).
These DEMO suggest that investment performance may be affected by a first-mover
advantage effect (see section 4.3, Subject matter related hypothesis – first-mover advantage).
DEMO Conclusion
The results of previous studies suggest a number of considerations that impact on the current
research including that:
• absolute measures of DEMO may be overstated for less important criteria and
understated for more important criteria while the rank ordering of criteria may be a more
stable DEMO of importance;
• considering deal performance rather than new venture performance avoids many of the
problems associated with using venture performance as a DEMO variable;
• few criteria are likely to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful investments;
and
• investment performance may be affected by a DEMO advantage effect.

3 Analysis of Investment Decision Criteria
This chapter extends the analysis of DEMO in Bachher (2000) related to the investment decision
criteria used by venture capitalists. In Stage # 4 of his study, Bachher gathered data on the
importance of 114 criteria from 100 venture capitalists (see chapter 5 for further details on
Bachher’ s study). Venture capitalists rated DEMO importance of each criterion on a 7-point scale
where 1 represented “Not Important” and 7 represented “Extremely Important.” Bachher’s
analysis is extended in this DEMO by considering the rankings of criteria in addition to their
ratings and by considering the variability in ratings and rankings.
3.1 Highest rated criteria
DEMO his analysis, Bachher identified important criteria on the basis of their DEMO ratings. Table
2 shows the ten highest rated of the 114 criteria.
Table 2 Criteria rated most important

6. Ability to create value for future shareholders 6.16
7. Ability to place the new DEMO in a position of market leadership 6.11

9. Ability to recruit people for the new venture'DEMO team 6.00
10. The management team's leadership experience 6.00
Note. The data in this table is derived from results reported in Bachher (2000).
12
Most of these criteria relate to the abilities and characteristics of the DEMO team.
These results are consistent with earlier studies that found criteria related to the management
team rated the most important (Zopounidis, 1994; Muzyka, Birley & Leleux, 1996). Baccher
(2000) provides a more DEMO analysis of the mean ratings of the criteria.
3.2 Rankings – an alternative method of analysis
An alternative analysis of the survey data involves DEMO the relative rankings of criteria
by the venture capitalist rather than the values of the individual ratings. The survey directly
gathered information about the DEMO attached to individual criteria. Since each
criterion was evaluated using the same 7-point scale, the survey also contains information
about the relative importance of an individual criterion compared to the other criteria.
Deriving rankings for the DEMO makes explicit the information about relative importance
contained in the ratings.
The difference between ratings and rankings relates to the attribute that is being DEMO
(i.e., they represent different perspectives on the importance assigned to the criteria). Ratings
measure the amount of importance attached to a criterion. DEMO measure the relative
importance of a criterion compared to the other criteria. Each approach is relevant but to
slightly different questions.
The following example DEMO the derivation of rankings from the survey information.
Figure 2 shows the results of a fictitious survey of two venture capitalists (VC #1 and VC #2)
who have rated three criteria (X, Y and DEMO) on a 7-point scale. The ratings of the three criteria
by DEMO venture capitalist are overlaid on a single line in Figure 2 in order to simplify the
Figure and to illustrate the information about relative DEMO contained in the ratings.
The letters A to G are used in the scale rather than the numbers 1 to 7 to illustrate that DEMO is
no absolute meaning to the labels attached to the scale.
13
Figure 2 Illustration of ratings vs. rankings
VC #1
VC #2
XY DEMO
AB C D E F G
YX Z
AB C D E F G
Ratings can be determined directly in this example by assigning DEMO numbers one to seven
to the letters A to G respectively in the scale. Under this interpretation, VC #1 assigns a
rating of importance of 4 to criterion X while VC #2 assigns a rating of DEMO to criterion X.
Rankings can be derived from the same example by assigning numbers to the criteria
based on their relative importance compared to DEMO criteria. Thus, for VC #1, criteria Z is
assigned a ranking of 1, criteria Y is assigned a ranking of 2 and criteria X is assigned a
ranking of 3.
These two approaches lead to DEMO different interpretations. For example, VC #1
gives criteria X a greater DEMO of importance than VC #2 (rating of 4 vs. 2) but VC #2
considers criteria X more important than criteria Y (ranking of 2 vs. 3) while VC #1
considers criteria Y more important than criteria X.
3.3 Highest ranked criteria
Rankings for each criterion in Bachher’s DEMO were calculated using the method described
in section 3.2. Since each venture capitalist evaluated 114 criteria and there were only 7
points on the DEMO scale, a large number of ties occurred. Two methods of dealing DEMO
ties were considered. The first method is to assign the minimum ranking to all tied values.
The second method is to assign the median DEMO to all tied values in the group. For
example, if five DEMO were given ratings of 7, then under the first method all DEMO a
ranking of 1 while under the second method all receive a ranking of 3. The analyses in this
14
chapter were performed using both methods and the results were similar. The DEMO
presented are calculated using the second method. This method was chosen as it produces
more conservative rankings particularly when large numbers of ties occur.

terms of identifying the most important criteria although the order of some criteria is shifted
slightly and the last items in the tables differ.
DEMO
3.4 Comparative strengths and weaknesses of ratings and rankings
Ratings are a DEMO direct measure of importance than rankings. They are what the
participants were asked to provide. Rankings are an indirect measure of importance inferred
from DEMO ratings.
Ratings assume that respondents are “identically calibrated instruments” (Kampen &
Swyngedouw, 2000). That is, an importance of 4 means the DEMO amount of importance to
each respondent. Muzyka, Birley & Leleux (1996) raise this concern in connection with
studies of venture capital investment decision stating:
However, almost all have the inherent limitations of scaling in that there are
inevitable differences in discrimination between what is considered important. DEMO, for
example, for some respondents, a 3 on a 5-point DEMO indicates a lower degree of
importance, whereas for others, only a 1 truly indicates something of lesser
importance. (p. 275)
There is evidence of this effect in Bachher’s survey. Of the 100 participants, 58 used the
entire 7-point scale. The remaining 42 participants used less than DEMO full scale with 24
selecting only ratings greater than or equal to 3.
Rankings are less sensitive to concerns about scaling since they are DEMO on relative
rather than absolute scores. Rankings are also less sensitive to the effect identified by
Shepherd (1999) that “venture capitalists have a DEMO to overstate the least important
criteria and understate the most important criteria” (p. 83).
However, in some ways, rankings are a weaker form of looking at the responses.
Rankings can say a criterion is DEMO important than another criterion but cannot say how much
importance the criterion has (e.g., one criterion may be relatively more important than
another DEMO both may be unimportant to the overall decision).
16
Thus there are advantages and disadvantages to the use of ratings and DEMO Both
ratings and rankings are considered in the analyses in this study.
3.5 Variability in ratings and rankings
C.G. Jung (1957/1970) commenting DEMO individual personalities states:
The statistical method shows the facts in the light of the ideal average but does not
give us a picture DEMO their empirical reality. While reflecting an indisputable aspect of
reality, it DEMO falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way. … The distinctive
thing about real facts, however, is their individuality. Not to put DEMO fine a point on it,
one could say that the real picture consists of nothing but exceptions to the rule, and
that, DEMO consequence, absolute reality has predominately the character of irregularity.
(p. 250)
The preceding sections of this chapter examine the average ratings and DEMO of
criteria. Averages provide us with valuable information but, as indicated DEMO the quotation by
Jung, they also hide information about variability within DEMO results. Considering the
variability in assessments of criteria along with the average ratings and rankings may lead to
valuable insights into the decision-making process.
DEMO are two opposing views of the investment decision making process. One is that the
decision process is formulaic with a consistent set of criteria DEMO by all venture capitalists.
The other view is that the decision process is an art that cannot be captured in a generalized
process.
Muzyka, Birley & Leleux (1996) illustrate these two views in commenting on DEMO
studies. They state that the earlier studies “have assumed a single hierarchy of decision
criteria in all cases and across all venture capitalists. We DEMO not accept that this is valid” (p.
274).
17
Similarly, one of the venture capitalists who participated in the Bachher survey made the
following comment related to assessing the importance of the criteria:DEMO
These answers will vary wildly with the portfolio company, its products DEMO markets,
the development stage, people and financial needs and risks. DEMO answers are by no
means representative of a generalized process. (Bachher, 2000, p. 106)
These two views lead to two different interpretations of variability in the ratings and
rankings. MacMillan, Siegel & Subbanarisimha (DEMO) consider the variability in ratings, as
measured by the standard deviation of the ratings, as a measure of consensus. This is
consistent with their objective of identifying the most common criteria used by venture
capitalists.
DEMO alternative interpretation of variability in the assessments of criteria is that the
variability reflects a tailoring of the importance placed on individual criteria to DEMO specific
venture and the environment it faces. If tailoring is occurring, DEMO will produce variability in
the importance placed on individual criteria.
The question that is investigated in the following sections of this chapter is whether DEMO
is a single hierarchy of criteria that apply in all cases and across all venture capitalists. This
question is investigated by examining the variability DEMO the ratings and rankings assigned to
the investment decision criteria.
3.6 Measuring variability – metric and ordinal approaches
Both ratings and rankings are ordinal DEMO of measurement. This raises the issue of how to
measure variability. One approach is to treat the variables as interval scaled variables. This
approach DEMO often used though there is considerable controversy over whether such as
approach is appropriate (Kampen & Swyngedouw, 2000). With this approach metric
DEMO such as standard deviations can be used to measure variability. An alternative
18
approach is to use measures of variation designed specifically for use with DEMO data. Blair
& Lacy (2000) describe a class of such measures of ordinal variation. Both approaches are
used in the analyses that follow.

3.9 Comparison of variability in ratings and rankings
While there are similarities DEMO the charts of ratings and rankings, there are also differences.
The DEMO significant difference relates to the area on the left-hand side of the graphs where
the criteria show high variability in ratings but low variability DEMO rankings. The differences
are illustrated by examining the criterion related to media coverage. Table 4 shows the
number of respondents who rated this criterion DEMO each of the seven levels on the ratings
scale.

Table 5 shows the number of respondents who ranked this criterion in each of the ten
groups of rankings.
These Tables show DEMO there is significant variability in the amount of importance placed
on the criterion (i.e., the rating) but there is consistency in the relative unimportance of the
criterion (i.e., the ranking). This further supports DEMO finding in section 3.4, Comparative
strengths and weaknesses of ratings and DEMO, that different venture capitalists are using
different parts of the 7-point DEMO to indicate that a criteria is unimportant.

3.10 Interpretation
There are a number DEMO regions of interest in the charts of variability. Figure 7 shows these
regions on a graph of the means and standard deviations of the DEMO for each of the 114
criteria.
Region 1 contains those criteria that are ranked as highly important and are consistently
ranked highly. Examples of DEMO criteria include:
• the management team’ s level of commitment to the success of the new venture;
• the management team’ s DEMO of urgency regarding the new venture;
• ability to create a superior product or service compared to that of the competition;
• DEMO offering is driven by market demand; and
• ability to create DEMO for future shareholders.
As these criteria are consistently rated as very important, they can be thought of as
necessary conditions for investment. A new venture that lacks these characteristics is
unlikely to receive funding.

Region 2 contains those criteria that are ranked DEMO unimportant and are consistently
ranked lowly. Examples of these criteria include:
• received positive media coverage;
• strategy to contend with changes DEMO macro-economic factors affecting the new venture;
• contingency plan developed by the new venture;
• the management team's recognition of chances DEMO failure; and
• the management team's educational background.
As these DEMO are consistently rated as unimportant, they generally are not a significant
DEMO in the decision to invest though, if a new venture was DEMO lacking in one of
these characteristics, it might lead to the DEMO capitalist rejecting the investment.
25
S tanda rd de via tion
Criteria in the middle regions have moderate importance to venture capitalists. These
DEMO fall into two regions. Region 3 contains those criteria that are consistently ranked as
moderately important. Examples of these criteria include:
•
•
DEMO management skills;
ability to focus the new venture on building “core competencies” that may yield a
competitive advantage;
•
•
•
ability DEMO anticipate problems early on in the new venture;
strategy of the new venture to respond to possible attack from competitors; and
level of market analysis in the business plan.
Region 4 contains those criteria that DEMO inconsistently ranked. Examples of these criteria
include:
• venture offering has or can protect its intellectual property;
• venture offering has been DEMO as a functioning prototype;
• venture offering is designed using proprietary core technology owned by the new
venture;
• venture offering has DEMO potential to be sold in international markets; and
• presence of DEMO biographies of the management team.
The criteria in Region 4 are qualitatively different than those in Region 3. The high
variability of criteria in DEMO 4 is a result of the criteria being ranked very highly in some
instances and being considered unimportant in other cases. Thus Region 4 DEMO criteria
that are as important as the highest ranking criteria in some individual cases though they are
relatively unimportant in other cases.
3.11 Conclusions
DEMO evidence from considering the variability in criteria suggests a number of conclusions
particularly as they relate to the question of whether there is a DEMO of criteria.
26
The area in Figure 7 that includes Regions 1, 2 and 3 contains those criteria with lesser
variability. These criteria do reflect a hierarchy DEMO some criteria being consistently ranked
highly important and others consistently being ranked less important. While there is evidence
of a hierarchy, the fact that some variability does exist suggests that it is not a rigid hierarchy
DEMO a specific criterion is always considered more important than another specific criteria.
Rather is it a more general hierarchy with some variability between specific DEMO and
venture capitalists.
Region 4 includes criteria with higher variability and these criteria do not form part of the
hierarchy. These criteria are as DEMO as the highest ranked criteria in some individual
cases but are considered unimportant in other circumstances.
Thus, the analysis of the criteria suggests that the answer to the question of whether there
is a single hierarchy DEMO criteria that apply in all cases and across all venture capitalists is yes
and no. Some of the criteria used by venture capitalists do DEMO a general hierarchy that is
consistently ranked across ventures. However, there DEMO other criteria that do not form part of
this hierarchy and whose importance varies depending on the specific venture being
evaluated.
The second conclusion DEMO is suggested by the analysis is that there are a number of
criteria that are consistently considered very important by venture capitalists and these
DEMO can be thought of as necessary conditions for investment. New ventures that do not
score well on these criteria are unlikely to receive funding DEMO venture capitalists.

4 Hypotheses
This section sets out hypotheses related to the relationship between DEMO criteria used in the
investment decision and deal performance. The hypotheses relate to deal performance for
Internet-related ventures, the importance placed on criteria in the decision process and the
subject matter of the criteria, specifically first-mover advantage.
4.1 Deal performance for Internet-related ventures
Chapter 1 described the dramatic DEMO in investment in Internet-related businesses by venture
capitalists. Internet-related ventures accounted for 60% of total venture capital investments in
the second quarter of 2000 (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2000). One possible explanation for
the appeal of Internet-related ventures is the speed at which Internet-related ventures mature
(see, for example, the quotation in section 4.3, Subject matter related hypothesis – first-
mover advantage). This speed may allow venture capitalists to realize a return DEMO their
investments in Internet-related ventures more quickly than for investments in other
technology-related ventures.
A second possible explanation for the appeal of Internet-related ventures DEMO venture
capitalists is the very large potential returns that may result. Internet-related ventures can
access a worldwide market often with little financial capital invested DEMO physical assets. Thus,
when they succeed, Internet-related ventures may offer DEMO large returns to their
investors. Conversely, since they often have few DEMO assets, when these ventures fail,
investors may recover little or DEMO of their original investment.
This analysis leads to the following hypotheses:
H1 : Deal performance can be assessed by venture capitalists earlier for DEMO
related ventures than for other-technology based ventures.
28
H2 : Investments in Internet-related ventures have more extreme levels of deal
DEMO, both positive and negative, than investments in other technology-related
ventures.
4.2 Decision process related hypotheses
The basic relationship of interest in this study DEMO that between the venture capitalists’
assessment of the importance of criteria at the time of investment and the subsequent deal
performance.
The new venture DEMO affected by new events and the resolution of uncertainties between the
time of investment by the venture capitalist and the realization of that investment DEMO the
venture capitalist. These factors could have a significant effect on the deal performance that
cannot be attributed to the factors assessed by the DEMO capitalist at the time of investment.
These relationships are illustrated in the Figure 8.
Figure 8 Conceptual model

performance
DEMO 1
The criteria used in the decision to invest reflect conditions that can be assessed by the
venture capitalist at the time of investment. DEMO importance placed on the criteria is specific
to the new venture being evaluated and the time the decision is made and may change
between DEMO and over time.
29
New events (e.g., the emergence of a competing technology, or a change in legislation
affecting the venture) will affect deal performance and may obscure the relationship between
the criteria used in the decision to invest DEMO deal performance. Alternatively, these new
events may amplify the differences between DEMO and unsuccessful ventures by
reinforcing small differences between ventures (i.e., creating a positive feedback loop).
Deal performance may also be affected by DEMO resolution of uncertainties that existed at
the time of investment. The assessment of the new venture at the time of the investment can
be DEMO of as assessing a distribution of risk/return possibilities for the new venture. Over
time the distribution “collapses” to a specific return as the DEMO are resolved. This
may result in a venture with a favorable distribution at the time of investment turning out to
be an unsuccessful investment. DEMO may occur not because of an error in assessing the
venture at the time of investment but rather because uncertainties that existed at that DEMO
happened to turn out unfavorably to the new venture.
These factors suggest that deal performance may be significantly affected by events
subsequent to the DEMO of investment. Still, it is expected that there will be some DEMO
between the criteria used in the decision to invest and deal performance. Therefore, it is
expected that some criteria will distinguish between successful and unsuccessful deal
performance. If there is a relationship between the criteria used DEMO make the investment
decision and deal performance, the findings of MacMillan, Zemann & Subbanarasimha
(1987) suggest that few criteria will predict success. DEMO, the first hypothesis
related to the decision making process is:
DEMO : A small number of criteria will distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful deal performance.
The analysis in chapter 3 concludes that criteria that are DEMO assessed as
important can be considered necessary conditions for investment. These criteria will be
considered important in the investment decision for all new ventures DEMO, therefore, are
unlikely to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful deals. The analysis in chapter 3
30
also found that some criteria are inconsistently assessed (i.e., the importance DEMO on the
criteria varies from deal to deal). These criteria may distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful deals. This analysis results in the following DEMO:
H4 : Criteria that do distinguish between successful and unsuccessful deals have
above average variability.
4.3 Subject matter related hypothesis – first-mover advantage
DEMO hypotheses discussed above do not consider the subject matter of specific criteria.
Section 2.4, First-mover advantage, describes the advantages and disadvantages associated
with DEMO a first-mover. First-mover advantage is often considered an important attribute of
new ventures, particularly those associated with the Internet as illustrated by the following
comment:
Four months: That’s the narrow window of opportunity that a would-be Internet
entrepreneur has to transform an idea into an actual product DEMO available on the
Web, insists J. Neil Weintraut, a general partner at 21st Century Internet Venture
Partner, in San Francisco. “Time to market is the only advantage of being a start-up,”
he explains. “Put DEMO, it’s four months—or game over. If you have an idea that
DEMO want to ponder for half a year, you might as well DEMO about it. On the Internet,
if you can, then you DEMO Because if you don’t someone else will.” (Mieszkowski,
2000, p. 148)
This leads to the following hypothesis:
H5 : Criteria DEMO to first-mover advantage distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful deals.
31
5 Methods
The study was conducted in two parts. The original study DEMO by Bachher (2000)
gathered information about the importance of the DEMO used in the investment decision.
The follow-up study gathered information about deal performance.
5.1 Sample
The population of interest for this study is venture DEMO involved in early stage
financing for technology-based new ventures. The unit of analysis is the individual venture
capitalist.
Bachher developed a network of venture DEMO contacts and identified a target group
of 200 venture capitalists for his survey. The criteria used in identifying this target group
included venture capitalists DEMO:
• were actively investing at the time of the survey;
• invest in early-stage, technology-based ventures;
• have two or more funds (a sign of success as a venture capitalist).
The development of this network is described further in Bachher (2000).
One hundred of these venture capitalists participated in the original survey. Thirty-two
percent of DEMO venture capitalists were from Canada, 26% from California, 16% from
Massachusetts, 23% from other States, 2% from Asia and 1% from Europe. DEMO percent of
the venture capitalists had one to five years of experience as a venture capitalist while the
others had six or more years DEMO experience.
Because of the methods used to develop the network including the fact that many of the
individual participants were recommended by other participants, the original survey is not a
32
random sample. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings is an issue. While not a
random sample, the sample was intended to include a significant proportion of the venture
capital firms that provide early stage financing to DEMO new ventures. The
MoneyTree Survey of venture capital activity for the second quarter of 2000 (MoneyTree,
2000) includes a listing of the DEMO most active U.S. venture capital firms in that period. The
firms listed include those involved in all types of venture capital financing and thus DEMO
a larger population than the subject of this study (venture capitalists DEMO in early stage
financing of technology-based new ventures). Nonetheless, individual DEMO capitalists
from 15 (20%) of these 75 firms participated in the survey.
The follow-up survey included only the 100 venture capitalists who participated DEMO the
original survey.
5.2 Measures
5.2.1 Investment decision-making criteria
Bachher developed the 114 investment decision-making criteria through:
• a review of the criteria DEMO in previous studies;
• a case study; and
• interviews DEMO venture capitalists.
The resulting criteria were reviewed by three Canadian venture capitalists for validation
and their suggestions were incorporated into the design of the DEMO (Bachher, 2000).
5.2.2 Deal performance
The dependent variable for this study is deal performance. Ideally, deal performance is
measured as the annualized rate of return on the investment in the new venture. However,
DEMO measure is not feasible for the following reasons:
33
•
•
venture capitalists generally do not make information about the rates DEMO return on specific
investments publicly available;
this measure is only determinable on disposition of the investment in the new venture.
Disposition of an DEMO may not occur for five to ten years after the date of
investment.
Consequently, alternative measures of deal performance need to be considered. Robinson
(1998), Bantel (1998) and Brush & Chaganti (1998) suggest that multiple performance
measures are appropriate when studying venture capital investments. Bantel (1998) and
Brush & Chaganti (1998) also suggest that subjective measures may be appropriate. Further,
Bantel (1998) suggests that “creativity in DEMO assessment of performance is necessary in
research of this nature” (p. DEMO).
Smart (1999) measured deal performance by asking the venture capitalist to rate deal
performance on a 5-point scale as (5) mega-winner (4) winner (3) neutral (walking dead) (2)
loser DEMO (1) mega-loser. The current study uses this measure of deal performance. This
measure has the advantage of dealing directly with deal performance but DEMO the
disadvantage of being subjective.
Deal performance can also be measured indirectly by looking at changes in the new
venture since the date of DEMO Events such as initial public offerings (“IPOs”),
acquisitions, mergers DEMO subsequent financings may be important signals of the performance
of the new venture and, indirectly, of deal performance. These events involve a detailed
DEMO of the business by a potential investor (e.g., underwriter, acquirer DEMO venture
capitalist) at a date subsequent to the original investment and, therefore, may indicate the
performance of the venture. The Canadian Venture Capital Association has collected
statistics related to the performance of venture capital investments DEMO on the mechanism
used to exit the investment. Performance was measured by the ratio of the value realized on
exiting the investment to the DEMO of the investment in the venture. For 1998, these
statistics show DEMO investments in ventures that went public had an average return of 3.77
34
times the investment in the venture and investments in ventures that were DEMO had an
average return of 2.37 times the investment (Macdonald, 1999). Similarly, a new venture
may no longer be in operation (DEMO, it may have failed since the date of investment). If DEMO
new venture has failed, it can be inferred that the deal DEMO unsuccessful. Thus, information
about changes in the new venture can be DEMO to infer deal performance. This measure has
the advantage of being based on objective evidence about events related to the new venture.
It has DEMO disadvantage of being an indirect measure of deal performance.
Thus two measures of deal performance are used in this study. One is a subjective
DEMO obtained by questionnaire from the venture capitalists and the other is an indirect
objective measure obtained from information about events related to the new DEMO since
the date of investment.
5.3 Design
The study design involves two phases. The original survey gathered information about
importance of various decision-making criteria. DEMO responding to the survey, the venture
capitalists were asked to keep DEMO mind a specific investment they made in a new venture
within the last 12 months.
The follow-on survey took place approximately one year after DEMO original survey and
gathered information about deal performance. Thus deal performance was assessed by the
venture capitalists approximately 12 to 24 months after the DEMO of the investment.
Conducting the survey in two phases helps ensure that the results are not biased by
retrospection by the venture capitalists. MacMillan, Zemann, & Subbanarasimha (1987)
measured both the criteria and performance DEMO the same date and found evidence of
significant retrospection in the results.
35
An important issue in the design of a follow-up survey is timing. DEMO up early has
the benefits of capturing performance on a timely basis relative to the decision to invest.
However, in some cases, it DEMO be too early to accurately assess deal performance. In
addition, their DEMO be a “honeymoon period” where problems in the new venture are
beginning to surface but the venture capitalist fails to recognize them having only DEMO
made the decision that the venture was a good investment. Delaying the measurement of
performance has the benefit of allowing more time to assess DEMO However, delaying
the measurement makes it more difficult to contact the DEMO capitalists, who may no
longer be with the firms they were DEMO at the time of the investment, and thus may reduce
the DEMO size. In addition, the longer the period between the investment and DEMO
measurement of deal performance, the greater the likelihood that events and DEMO
arising after the decision to invest will affect deal performance. This effect could mask the
relationship between the decision-making criteria and deal performance (see section 4.2,
Decision process related hypotheses).
The industry in which DEMO new venture operates may also impact the optimal timing for
measuring performance. Many of the new ventures in the survey are Internet ventures where
DEMO or failure may be determinable in a very short period of time. Other new ventures in
the survey are life sciences companies where results DEMO take much longer to materialize.
Taking these considerations into account it was decided that measuring performance 12
to 24 months after the date of DEMO original investment was reasonable.
An application for ethics review of research involving human participants was submitted
to the Office of Research Ethics at the DEMO of Waterloo. Notification of full ethics
clearance was received in July 2000.
36
5.4 Procedures
The original survey was conducted using a web-based instrument. The DEMO survey
gathered information about the success of the investments by:
• surveying the original participants for their view on the success of the DEMO; and
• gathering publicly available information about the new venture using DEMO Internet.
5.4.1 Original web-based survey procedures
Venture capitalists who had agreed to participate in the survey were directed to the Internet
site and completed DEMO questionnaire on-line. After reading the instructions, participants were
requested to complete DEMO survey keeping in mind a specific investment made within the last
12 months in a technology-based new venture in its early stages of financing.
DEMO 114 criteria in the survey were grouped into the following six categories:
•
•
•
•
•
•
characteristics of the new venture’s DEMO team;
characteristics of the new venture’s target market;
characteristics of the new venture’s offering (product or service);
characteristics of the DEMO venture’s positioning within its competitive environment;
characteristics of the new venture’s capital payback projections;
characteristics of the new venture’s business plan.
Participants DEMO asked initially to indicate the degree of importance they place on the six
categories of criteria when deciding to make the investment in the DEMO venture using a scale
from “Consider it first” to “Consider it last.” The individual categories of criteria were then
presented to the participants in DEMO order of importance indicated by the participant. That is,
the individual criteria related to the category rated “Consider it first” were presented first
DEMO to the individual criteria related to the category rated “Consider it last” which were
presented last.
37
For each criterion, the venture capitalist was next asked to assess the importance of the
criterion on their decision to invest in the new DEMO and to assign a rating to the criterion
on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 represents “Not Important,” 7 represents “Extremely
Important” and N/A represents “Not Applicable.”
At the conclusion of the DEMO, background information about the venture capitalist and
the investment was gathered. DEMO phase of the study was conducted between June 1999 and
September 1999. Additional details on this phase of the study are contained in Bachher
(2000).
5.4.2 Follow-on mail survey procedures
The follow-on survey was sent DEMO mail in July 2000 to all of the participants in the original
survey. Appendix B contains a copy of the survey instrument. The survey DEMO three
questions and was designed to minimize the time required of the participants in order to
maximize the response rate. The survey first reminded DEMO of the specific venture
they selected in the original survey by including the short description of the new venture
provided by the participant in DEMO original survey.
Participants were then asked about specific changes that may have occurred in the
venture since the time of investment. In addition to DEMO information related to one of
the measures of success, this question DEMO expected to cause the participant to focus on the
specific venture and how it has performed.
The second question asked the participants to assess DEMO success of their investment in the
venture using a 5-point scale where 1 represents “Dismal failure”, 3 represents “Break even”
and 5 represents “Outstanding success.” Participants were also given the option to respond
that it was DEMO early to tell” about the success of the investment.
38
The third question asked for the annualized rate of return for the DEMO It was anticipated
that it was likely too early to gather this information but that it may be useful information in
those cases where DEMO was available.
In August 2000, second requests were sent to those DEMO had not responded to the original
request. Second requests were sent by e-mail and included a copy of the original request.
5.4.3 Internet information DEMO
Information about the success of the investments was also gathered using public information
about the new venture available on the Internet.
This procedure used DEMO identity of the venture capitalist and the description of the new
entity provided by the venture capitalist in the original survey to determine the DEMO of the
new venture. The identity of the new venture was used to gather information about its
success.
The first step in this procedure DEMO to identify the venture capitalist’s Internet site. This
was done using an Internet search engine to search for the venture capital firm’s name.
Internet DEMO were found for most of the venture capital firms involved in the original survey.
Generally, venture capitalists’ Internet sites contain a section describing their portfolio of
investments. This information typically includes the names of the ventures DEMO their portfolio,
a short description of the ventures and links to the ventures’ Internet sites. The description of
the new venture provided by DEMO venture capitalist in the original survey was compared to the
short descriptions on the venture capitalist’ s Internet site in order to identify a DEMO In 70
cases, a definitive match was made. In eight cases, the description of the new venture
provided by the venture capitalist in DEMO original survey was too vague to make a positive
match. In the remaining 22 cases, a match was not made either because the venture capitalist
did not have an Internet site or because more than one DEMO in their portfolio had a
39
description that was similar to the one provided by the venture capitalist DEMO the original
survey.
Once the identity of the new venture was determined, information was gathered about
events affecting the new venture since the date of the investment by the venture capitalist.
This information was gathered by DEMO the new venture’s Internet site. The new venture’s
Internet site was located either by following a link from the venture capitalist’ s Internet site
DEMO by using an Internet search engine to search for the site. The new venture’s Internet sites
typically contained a section, often titled “About the company,” that contained press releases
issued by the new venture. These DEMO releases include announcements of initial public
offerings, acquisitions, mergers and additional financing arrangements. A review of the press
releases was used to identify DEMO public offerings, acquisitions or additional financings that
occurred after the date DEMO investment by the venture capitalist. There may be some potential
bias towards success with this step as it is based on information provided by DEMO venture. This
potential bias is reduced by comparing the information to information provided by the
venture capitalists and to information available from other Internet DEMO (see following
paragraph).
In addition to the above, a number of Internet sites provide information about venture
capital investments. These sites include DEMO
(http://wwdyn.mercurycenter.com/business/moneytree/index.cfm) and Internet VC Watch
(DEMO://www.internetvcwatch.com). These sites provide information about venture capital
investments and therefore can help in identifying the new venture and in identifying
subsequent DEMO in the new venture. Information from these sites was used to
supplement the information gathered above.
Information from the Internet was gathered during the DEMO April 2000 to August 2000.
40
5.4.4 Process to ensure confidentiality
The process described in the preceding section DEMO information about the identities of the
venture capitalists and the descriptions of the new entities in ways not originally anticipated
and not communicated to DEMO survey participants at the time of the original survey.
Accordingly, a DEMO was developed to ensure that the confidentiality of the information
provided by the venture capitalists is preserved.
The data elements from the original survey DEMO separated into two databases to ensure
that the criteria assessments made by the participants in the original survey could not be
identified with specific DEMO The Identification database contains information about the
identity of the venture capitalist and the description of the new venture. The Analysis
database contains the DEMO of the decision-making criteria.
Unique identification codes were assigned to each record in the Identification database
(e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) DEMO distinct analysis codes to each record in the Analysis database (e.g., A,
B, C, etc.). A third party not otherwise DEMO with the research was the only person with
access to the list matching identifiers in the two databases. However, this individual did not
have access to either database.
Information about the identity of the venture capitalist DEMO the new venture were replaced
with the identification code whenever there was a move from the Identification database to
the Analysis database (e.g., DEMO the success of the venture was determined). The
information was then given to the third party who replaced the identification code with the
DEMO code and returned the information to the researcher. The researcher entered the
information about success into the Analysis database and analyzed the information without
DEMO ability to identify the specific venture capitalist or new venture to which the information
related.
41
Table 6 shows the information available to the researcher at each step DEMO the process (i.e.,
when identifying the ventures, when determining success and when analyzing the results).

6 Results
This chapter presents the results of the study. As described DEMO section 5.1, Sample, the survey
was not a random sample and thus does not meet the statistical requirement for a random
selection from DEMO population of interest. Nonetheless, statistical tests are used in a number DEMO
the analyses in this chapter not in order to reach a statistical conclusion but rather to help
judge whether the differences are large enough DEMO be considered important.
6.1 Summary of responses to the follow-up survey
Responses to the follow-up survey were received from 40 of the 100 participants DEMO the
original survey.
6.1.1 Venture capitalists’ assessments of deal performance
Table 7 shows the venture capitalists’ assessment of deal performance rated on a 5-point
DEMO (Question 2 in the survey). The results are separated between DEMO and other
technology-based ventures based on the descriptions provided by the venture capitalists in
the original survey.
The response rate was 37% for Internet DEMO and 42% for other technology-based
ventures. These results do not indicate any significant difference in the response rate
resulting from the industry in which DEMO new venture operates.
Hypothesis H1 is that deal performance can be assessed by venture capitalists earlier for
Internet-related ventures than for other-technology based ventures. DEMO 7 shows that only
13% of venture capitalists who invested in Internet ventures indicated that it was “too early
to tell” about the performance DEMO the investment while 28% of the venture capitalists who
invested in other technology-based ventures selected this response. While this finding is
43
consistent with the hypothesis, the Fisher exact test for the 2x2 table (Internet vs. other
technology-based, too early to tell vs. deal performance DEMO) was not statistically
significant (p = .44). Thus the evidence for hypothesis H1 is in the predicted direction but is
weak.

Total 41 59 100
Hypothesis H2 is that investments in Internet-related ventures have more DEMO levels
of deal performance, both positive and negative, than investments in other technology-related
ventures. Table 7 shows that extreme levels of performance (i.e., ratings of 1 or 5) are
dominated by Internet ventures while DEMO moderate levels of performance (i.e., ratings of 2
to 4) DEMO dominated by other technology-based ventures. When Internet investments are
successful they are very successful and when they are unsuccessful they are very
unsuccessful. While DEMO finding is consistent with the hypothesis, the Fisher exact test for DEMO
2x2 table (Internet vs. other technology-based, Extreme levels of performance vs. moderate
levels of performance) was not statistically significant (p = .26)DEMO Thus the evidence for
hypothesis H2 is in the predicted direction but is weak.
The findings that investments in Internet ventures mature more quickly DEMO other
technology-based ventures and that investments in Internet ventures are more volatile than
44
investments in other technology-based ventures helps explain the attractiveness of Internet
ventures DEMO venture capitalists. Internet ventures offer the venture capitalist the potential of a
large gain, though also the risk of a large loss, in DEMO short period of time.
6.1.2 Subsequent events affecting the new ventures
Table 8 shows the subsequent events that occurred in the ventures subsequent to DEMO date of
the investment (Question 1 of the survey).

Subsequent financing is by far the most common event. Subsequent financing was
DEMO in 73% of the responses. The finding that 3 of the 15 Internet ventures had gone
public (20%) compared to 3 of the DEMO other technology-based ventures (12%) is consistent
with and provides some additional evidence for hypothesis H1.
6.1.3 Annualized rates of return
The third question DEMO the survey asked for the annualized rate of return for the deal. Table 9
summarizes the responses to this question.

Total responses 40
The finding that DEMO of return were provided in a relatively small proportion of cases
(DEMO) is consistent with the expectation set out in section 5.2.2, Deal performance.
6.2 Analysis of the results of the follow-up survey
6.2.1 Consistency DEMO measures of deal performance
Section 5.2.2, Deal performance, indicates that two measures of deal performance are
considered in this study. One is a DEMO measure obtained from the venture capitalists
and the other is an indirect objective measure obtained from information about events
occurring in the new venture DEMO the date of investment.
As shown in Table 10, ten respondents DEMO information about annualized rates of
return on their investment in the new venture. Table 10 relates the information about
annualized rates of return to DEMO subjective assessment of deal performance by the venture
capitalist.
In all cases, the subjective assessments are consistent with the information provided
about annualized rates of return. While the amount of data provided about annualized rates of
DEMO is limited, it does provide some support for the validity of DEMO the subjective
assessments as a measure of deal performance.

As a test of the DEMO of using changes occurring in the venture since the time of
investment as a measure of deal performance, changes identified by the venture capitalists
are compared to the subjective assessments of deal performance. Table 11 contains DEMO
comparison.
This table shows that certain events, specifically ceasing operations and DEMO public, are
strong correlated with deal performance. However, these events occurred in only a relatively
small number of ventures. The most commonly reported DEMO was subsequent financing.
Subsequent financing does not, however, correlate well with the subjective assessments of
deal performance. Subsequent financing occurred in new ventures DEMO failed as well as in
those that succeeded and in those where it was too early to tell. Therefore, the evidence from
this comparison indicates that subsequent financing events are not a valid measure of deal

6.2.2 Comparison of survey responses and Internet data
Information about the success of the investments was also gathered using public information
about the DEMO venture available on the Internet. It was intended that this information provide
an alternative source of information about deal performance that could supplement the DEMO
data thus increasing the overall response rate.
Information was gathered about 70 investments using the Internet. The results included
the identification of five ventures DEMO had gone public, four acquisitions and 32 subsequent
financings. This is DEMO information to that gathered from venture capitalists in the follow-
up survey.
In order to test the reliability of the Internet information, the common information
gathered by both procedures was compared. Of the 40 survey responses DEMO 70 investments
found on the Internet, there were 31 instances where DEMO was available from both
48
sources for the same investment. The common information related to going public,DEMO
acquisitions and subsequent financings. In 15 cases, the information from both DEMO survey
response and the Internet were identical. In 16 cases, there DEMO a single difference. Table 12
shows the results of the analysis of these differences.
Table 12 Analysis of differences between survey responses and Internet DEMO
Reason for difference Number of instances
Event identified in survey response but not Internet data:
• Venture’s Internet site does not include information DEMO
financing activities – many of these ventures were not public and
often their sites did not provide press release type information
• A financing DEMO identified on the venture’s Internet site but it
could not be determined whether it was the initial investment or
a subsequent one since it DEMO during the original survey
period
• Venture’s Internet site does not report press releases prior to
going public. The subsequent financing identified in the DEMO
response likely occurred prior to this time
• A public offering was indicated by the venture capitalist but
venture is not public according to DEMO identified venture’s
Internet web site – most likely a misidentification of the new
venture
Events identified in the Internet data but not the survey DEMO:
• Venture went public and received subsequent financing
according to the venture’s Internet site but the survey only
indicated the venture going public DEMO most likely an oversight on
the respondent’s part
• Venture was acquired according to Internet web site but no
acquisition indicated in the survey DEMO – venture capitalist’s
investment may not have been acquired resulting in the
difference
8

The majority of these differences DEMO the result of incomplete information being available
on the Internet. There were only four cases where the information conflicted. This suggests
that the information DEMO by venture capitalists in the survey responses is fairly reliable
since it is consistent with information provided by the venture on the Internet. The DEMO
49
also suggest that the information obtained from the Internet is often incomplete DEMO thus the
Internet information is not reliable.
Therefore, because of concerns DEMO the validity of using subsequent financing events as
a measure of deal performance (see section 6.2.1, Consistency of measures of deal
performance) and concerns about the reliability of the Internet data, the Internet data are not
used in the analyses that follow.
6.3 Decision-making criteria and deal DEMO
The relationship between the criteria used in the investment decision and deal performance is
analyzed by examining differences in the mean ratings and rankings DEMO different levels of
deal performance.
Four categories of deal performance are considered in this analysis. The first category,
successful deals (n=25), includes those survey responses where deal performance was rated 4
or 5. The DEMO category, unsuccessful deals (n=5), includes those survey responses where
deal performance was rated 1 or 2. The third category, too early to tell (n=10), includes those
survey responses that indicated that it was too early to assess deal performance. The single
response with a rating DEMO 3, break even, for deal performance is also included in this
category. The fourth category, nonresponses (n=60), includes the nonresponses to DEMO survey.
6.3.1 Mean ratings over all criteria
The mean ratings over all 114 criteria are 5.22 for successful deals, 5.20 for unsuccessful
deals, DEMO for the too early to tell category and 5.33 for the nonresponses. Comparison of the
means suggests that nonresponses do not differ systematically from DEMO other categories. The
fact that the means for all four categories are similar suggests that differences between the
four categories, if they exist, DEMO to be investigated by considering individual criteria.

that the means for the unsuccessful deals are more extreme in a few cases. This is not
unexpected DEMO that there are only five items in the unsuccessful category. These extreme
values are investigated further in the sections that follow.

Charts of the mean rankings show similar results to the above and DEMO not reproduced
here.
6.3.3 Statistical tests of differences between means
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed to determine “whether the entire set DEMO
sample means suggests that the samples were drawn from the same general population”
(Hair, Anderson, Tatham & Black, 1998, p. 332). ANOVA tests were run for each of the 114
criteria using the DEMO categories described in section 6.3.
Table 13 reports the results of the ANOVA tests of the mean ratings for the eight criteria
with significant DEMO statistics. Post hoc tests showed significant differences (p < .05) between
the unsuccessful category and the other categories in pairwise comparisons for the DEMO
related to technical excellence, research and development skills, product development skills
and the use of proprietary core technology. Significant differences did not occur DEMO the post
hoc pairwise comparisons between categories for the other criteria.
While a number of significant differences appear in these tests, care must be taken in
interpreting the results. The small sample size of the unsuccessful DEMO (n=5) makes the
results sensitive to individual unsuccessful deals which may not be representative of the
category and also to how venture capitalists DEMO the ratings scales for criteria (see section
3.4, Comparative strengths and weaknesses of ratings and rankings). The small size of the
unsuccessful DEMO also means that the test has low power and that the tests are therefore
not sensitive to small effect sizes. In addition, since 114 tests are performed, it can
reasonably be expected that there will be a few items that are significant at the 5% level
simply by DEMO

6.3.4 Hypothesis H3 – relationship between criteria and deal performance
Hypothesis H3 DEMO that a small number of criteria will distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful deal performance.
The analysis of the charts of mean ratings for individual DEMO (section 6.3.2) identified
seven of the 114 criteria as having large differences between categories of success. The
statistical analyses in section 6.3.3 identified DEMO criteria with significant differences.
However, as cautioned earlier, care must be taken in assessing the evidence provided by
these tests due to the DEMO number of comparisons tested.
Consequently, the evidence is supportive of H3 DEMO This finding is consistent with the
findings of MacMillan, Zemann & DEMO (1987) (see section 2.3). This finding
suggests that the DEMO decision criteria act primarily as filters to identify ventures
worthy of investment rather than as predictors of ultimate deal success.
6.3.5 Hypothesis H4 – DEMO and inconsistently rated criteria
Hypothesis H4 proposes that criteria that do distinguish between successful and unsuccessful
deals have above average variability.
To test these DEMO, the criteria with significant F values for the ANOVA tests (see
section 6.3.3, Statistical tests of differences between means) are analyzed to DEMO
whether they have above or below average variability. In addition, criteria DEMO extreme
variability are analyzed.
Of the eight criteria with significant F values for the ANOVA tests of mean ratings, five
have standard deviations in ratings above the average standard deviations for all criteria and
three have DEMO average standard deviations in ratings. Standard deviations of the ratings
are used as the measures of variability consistent with the discussion in section 3.6,DEMO
57
Measuring variability – metric and ordinal approaches, and section 3.7, Variability DEMO the
ratings.
Figure 13 shows the mean ratings of the four categories of deal performance for the five
highest rated criteria. Perhaps not surprisingly, these criteria also have very low variability
(see section 3.7, Variability DEMO the ratings).

Mean ratings
Venture offering is designed using proprietary core technology owned by the new DEMO
is the only criteria in Figure 14 that has a significant F value in the ANOVA tests. This is
also the criterion that appears DEMO the chart to best distinguish between successful and
unsuccessful deals. This criteria is examined in more detail in section 6.3.7, Technology
related criteria. However, overall there is no strong indication from the chart that criteria with
low variability distinguish successful from unsuccessful deals. Analyses performed using
rankings rather DEMO ratings produce similar results and are not presented here.
The above analyses show little indication that the level of variability in ratings is related
DEMO the success of deals. Consequently, evidence for H4 was not found.
DEMO Hypothesis H5 – first mover-advantage
Hypothesis H5 is that criteria related to first-mover advantage distinguish between successful
and unsuccessful deals.
To test this hypothesis, the 114 investment criteria were reviewed to identify those
criteria that relate DEMO first-mover advantage. The following three criteria were identified as
relating to first mover advantage:
• venture offering reaches the market before its competitors;DEMO
• potential to be first within its target market; and
• DEMO to create a new market niche.
Figure 15 shows the mean ratings of the four categories of deal performance for these three
criteria.

None of these criteria have DEMO F values in the ANOVA tests. In addition, the
differences in DEMO mean ratings between categories of deal performance are relatively small
and are inconsistent in direction. The results for mean rankings are similar. Thus, evidence
for H5 was not found.
6.3.7 Technology related criteria
Four out of DEMO eight criteria with significant F statistics for ratings (see Table 13) relate to
the technology of the new venture. This suggests that there DEMO be a relationship between the
importance placed on technology related criteria by the venture capitalist and deal
performance.
61
Mean rating
In order to investigate this possible relationshipfurther, the 114 investment criteria were
reviewed to identify those that relate to the technology of the new DEMO This was done by
the author and by two doctoral candidates studying in the area of management of technology.
Each of these individuals independently DEMO and ranked those criteria that they thought
were closely related to the technology of the new venture. Eight criteria were identified by
one of DEMO individuals and ten criteria by the other two. Seven of the criteria were identified
by all three individuals and one criterion was identified by DEMO of the individuals. The
remaining five criteria were identified by only one of the individuals. For purposes of the
current analysis, the technology related criteria are the seven criteria that were selected by all
three individuals DEMO the one criterion selected by two of the individuals. The technology
related criteria are:
• technical skills;
• product development skills;
DEMO venture offering is designed using proprietary core technology owned by the new
venture;
• research and development skills;
• venture offering has DEMO developed as a functioning prototype;
• the management team's commitment to technical excellence;
• identification of technology related risks associated with DEMO new venture; and
• project management skills.
The technology related criteria DEMO listed in order of the average ranking assigned to the
criteria and the criterion identified by only two of the three individuals is listed DEMO
Figure 16 shows the mean ratings of each of the four categories of deal performance for
the technology related criteria.

Note. Criteria marked with an asterisk have DEMO F values in the ANOVA tests.
For seven of the eight technology related criteria the mean rating for unsuccessful deals
was less than the DEMO rating for the other three categories. As indicated in Table 16, DEMO of
these criteria have significant F values in the ANOVA tests.
While the evidence from the above analysis is not conclusive, it strongly suggests that
venture capitalists whose investments were ultimately unsuccessful placed less importance
on DEMO related to the technology of the new venture than did venture capitalists investing
in the other ventures.

7 Conclusions
7.1 Implications of the study
The findings of this study DEMO a number of implications for venture capitalists and
researchers.
7.1.1 The changing risk and return profile of the venture capital industry
Chapter 1, Introduction, describes the shift in venture capital investment to Internet-related
businesses which now account for 60% of total venture capital investments. The analyses in
section DEMO, Venture capitalists’ assessments of deal performance, provide some evidence
that Internet-related investments mature more quickly than other technology-related ventures.
The analyses also suggest DEMO Internet-related investments have more extreme levels of
performance than investments in other technology-based ventures.
Together these findings portray a venture capital industry that is DEMO more volatile than
in the past. Such an environment is likely to be less forgiving to the weaker players in the
industry.
7.1.2 The DEMO of the decision-making process
The findings in this study add to the understanding of venture capitalists decision-making
processes that has been developed over the DEMO number of years (see section 2.1, Criteria
used in the investment decision). In particular, the analyses of the variability in the
importance assigned to investment criteria (see chapter 3) found a general hierarchy
DEMO many of the investment criteria. However, the analyses also found a DEMO of
criteria that are not part of the hierarchy. These criteria are as important as the highest ranked
criteria in some individual cases but DEMO not considered important in other circumstances.
64
These findings suggest that venture capital investing cannot be reduced to a DEMO or
checklist but rather that the criteria emphasized in making the decision to investment must be
tailored to the particular venture being considered.
7.1.3 DEMO of Internet data in researching the venture capital industry
The Internet has become an important source of information in society generally and in
academic DEMO Accordingly, the findings in section 6.2.2, Comparison of survey
responses and Internet data, have important implications to researchers. The analyses found
that information about events affecting ventures obtained from the Internet was generally
accurate but DEMO sometimes incomplete. Researchers gathering similar information using the
Internet will need to consider how this may affect the reliability of the data they gather.
DEMO Staged investments
The analysis in section 6.2.1, Consistency of measures of DEMO performance, found that
subsequent financing occurred in new ventures that failed DEMO well as those that succeeded.
The analyses in section 6.3, Decision-making DEMO and deal performance, found that it is
difficult to distinguish successful DEMO unsuccessful new ventures based on assessments
made at the time of the initial investment.
Together these findings suggest that success reveals itself only over DEMO and that venture
capitalists provide financing over several rounds in order to wait for the ventures to evolve
before committing their full investment to DEMO venture. Early rounds of financing by venture
capitalists can be thought of as purchases of options that allow them to wait for future
information DEMO committing additional funds to the venture.
65
7.1.5 Importance placed on technology-related investment criteria
The analyses in section 6.3.7, Technology related criteria, suggest that venture capitalists
whose investments were ultimately unsuccessful placed less importance on criteria related to
the technology of the new DEMO than did venture capitalists investing in the other ventures.
It is somewhat surprising that some venture capitalists would not emphasize technology-
related issues given DEMO all of the investments studied were in technology-based businesses.
An important implication of this finding is that venture capitalists need to pay particular
attention DEMO the technologies and technological capabilities of the ventures in which they
invest. To do this, venture capitalists need to be sufficiently knowledgeable about the
technologies used by the ventures they are evaluating to adequately assess the DEMO
7.1.6 Depth of assessment of technology related criteria
Figure 16 shows that venture capitalists whose investments were ultimately unsuccessful
placed greater importance on the DEMO that the venture offering has been developed as a
functioning prototype than other venture capitalists though they placed less importance on
the other technology-related DEMO A new venture’s technological capabilities include both
its existing technology assets and its ability to grow and expand these assets in the future.
Emphasizing DEMO functioning prototype while de-emphasizing the other technology-related
criteria may reflect a superficial appraisal of the new venture’s technological capabilities by
the venture capitalist.
Some DEMO for this possible explanation is provided by an analysis of the experience of
the venture capitalists. Four of the five venture capitalists (80%) DEMO investments were
ultimately unsuccessful had five or fewer years’ experience as a practicing venture capitalist.
Overall 50% of the venture capitalists in the survey DEMO six or more years experience. The
limited experience of the four out of five venture capitalists whose investments were
ultimately unsuccessful may indicate a DEMO of knowledge to evaluate the technological
66
capabilities of the new ventures. While the evidence is quite limited, a superficial appraisal of
the new venture’s technological capabilities would explain the apparent DEMO result.
This finding implies that venture capitalists need to perform detailed rather than
superficial assessments of the technology of new ventures and that their DEMO needs to
consider all aspects of the new ventures technological capabilities.
7.1.7 Summary of major findings
The analysis of rankings in addition to ratings DEMO the consideration of ordinal variation
(Blair & Lacy, 2000) in DEMO examination of the importance assigned by venture capitalists to
investment decision criteria provides new insights into the investment decision process.
Specifically, the analyses identify criteria with high variability that are qualitatively different
from the other criteria. DEMO criteria with high variability reflect factors whose importance to
the investment decision varies significantly from investment to investment.
The findings that Internet-related investments mature DEMO quickly than other
technology-related ventures and that they have more extreme levels of deal performance
provide insight into this important new segment of the DEMO capital industry.
The finding that few criteria distinguish successful from unsuccessful deal performance is
consistent with the findings of MacMillan, Zemann & Subbanarasimha (DEMO). The current
study extends this finding to Internet-related investments and identifies the assessment of the
technological capabilities of the new venture as an DEMO distinguishing characteristic.
67
7.2 Limitations
Because of the method used to develop the network of DEMO capitalists in the original
survey, the original survey is not a DEMO sample. Consequently, the generalizability of the
findings is an issue.
A DEMO limitation of the study involves the number of responses to the follow-up
survey and the inability to supplement the sample using the Internet. The DEMO of this
limitation is that the analysis of the follow-up survey is based on only the 40 questionnaires
received.
A related limitation involves the DEMO of investments in the unsuccessful category.
Only five unsuccessful investments were identified in the follow-up survey. The fact that the
survey took place during DEMO very strong economic period may have affected the number of
unsuccessful investment identified.
Together these limitations mean that the evidence in this study is DEMO suggestive than
conclusive.
7.3 Future research
A number of areas for future research are suggested by the findings of this study.
Research into the DEMO risk and return profile of the venture capital industry as a
result of the shift to Internet-related investments can provide insight into changes in DEMO
structure and profitability of the venture capital industry.
Extending the study to include more investments in different economic periods can help
to confirm or DEMO the findings of the study. In particular, further research into the
DEMO
importance of technology-related considerations in the investment decision and the related
impact DEMO investment performance is warranted.
In addition, further research into developing valid DEMO reliable tools for assessing the
technologies and technological capabilities of new ventures may benefit venture capitalists.
These tools could also benefit entrepreneurs seeking venture DEMO

Survey of Decision-Making Criteria Used by Venture Capitalists - A Follow-up
Thank you for participating in a survey of DEMO criteria used by venture
capitalists conducted last year by members of the Institute for Innovation Research (“IIR”)
group at the University of Waterloo.
One of the interesting findings from the study is that, while many criteria are consistently
rated as either important or unimportant, there are other criteria that are considered important
in some individual cases and unimportant in DEMO These findings have led us in the IIR to
the development of additional research ideas. In particular, the objectives of our current
research are to further investigate the variability in the importance of decision-making
criteria and DEMO relate the decision-making criteria to the subsequent performance of the
investment in the new venture. We are writing to request your participation in this DEMO
survey.
The follow-up involves gathering information on the performance of the investment based on
the attached questionnaire supplemented by information gathered from publicly available
DEMO (e.g., Internet websites, and news releases). Upon completion of DEMO study, an
executive summary will be developed and distributed to the DEMO s participants.
The follow-up survey involves answering three questions related to the investment you made
in the new venture. The questions are attached and DEMO take less than five minutes to
complete. You may omit any question you prefer not to answer. Participation is voluntary
and there are no DEMO or anticipated risks to participation in this study.
Your answers will be kept strictly confidential. Only members of the research team will have
access DEMO individual data. All information collected will be presented in aggregate manner in
any publications, presentations or workshops. The data collected through this study will be
kept for a period of at least five years in a DEMO location at the IIR.
