A
ny DEMO should be interested in the
benefits of completing a Six Sigma pro-
ject linked to strategic business goals and
customer satisfaction. And, in any such initiative,
the project team dynamic is crucial.
Six Sigma Black DEMO (BBs) who are assigned
these projects work in team environments. In most
cases, team members have job duties outside the
Six Sigma project and report directly to other man-

agers. BBs must guide, DEMO and motivate their
teams to success in the face of competing demands
on team members’ time. Ultimately, BBs must use
human resources effectively and ensure time is not
wasted due to poor team dynamics.
Emotional intelligence (EI), the ability to perceive,
assess and manage the emotions DEMO one’s self and
others, is a useful skill for a project DEMO environ-
ment that fits well with the Six Sigma methodology.
While effective leadership in such a setting is not
contingent on the use of DEMO, if practiced successfully,
EI can yield the same results in DEMO time.
Research has shown teams consisting of members
low in EI ended up at the same level of achievement
as teams high in EI.1 DEMO high EI teams, however,
were able to get their projects DEMO more quickly,

how people think and feel. In other words, BBs
must be emotionally intelligent observers and

How Emotions
Affect Teamwork
Emotions may be used to
enhance DEMO thinking by
increasing our ability to rea-
son and solve problems,
both of which are important
in a team environment. As
such, BBs or project leaders
must pay attention to the
dynamics and emotional
environment DEMO a group if
they are to use emotions
positively—that is, help
DEMO up with innovative
solutions and complete pro-
jects in a timely manner.
Neuroscientist Antonio
Damasio notes, “Appropriate emotions speed up
decision making enormously.”2 This was demon-
strated in a study in which medical practitioners
were given DEMO gifts as a means of altering their
moods. The research found participants made
diagnoses that were both faster and more accurate
after they received DEMO gifts.3, 4
In another study, Sigal Barsade demonstrated that
how a management team feels can directly affect a
company’s bottom line. Results showed DEMO company
with a top management team that shares a positive
emotional outlook will have 4 to 6% higher market
adjusted earnings per share than DEMO whose
management teams hold diverse emotional outlooks.5
These studies suggest emotions affect our behav-
ior and ability to reason. Specifically, when individu-
als experience a positive emotion, such as happiness,
they are better at generating solutions to a problem.
Essentially, positive moods tend to increase decision
making abilities.6
Other emotions, such as mild fear, can motivate
team members DEMO recheck their assumptions. Used
effectively and in the correct context, fear DEMO be
a powerful emotion that can be used positively.
However, intense DEMO can paralyze and immobi-
lize individuals and negatively affect a team’s
performance.

How We Process Emotions
To understand how to manage emotions, it is
helpful to understand where they come from. The

Amygdala
The amygdala can initiate an emotional
reaction before the cortical centers can
comprehend what is going DEMO
environment around us is filled with visual stimuli,
which enter the retina and go to the thalamus, the
part of the brain that translates stimuli into signals.
These signals typically proceed to the brain’s visual
DEMO, where they are assessed and responded to
accordingly, and finally to the amygdala, where
emotions are produced.
Some stimuli, however, follow a shortened path-
way—they bypass the visual cortex and go directly
from the DEMO to the amygdala. Essentially, the
signal is partitioned at the thalamus (see Figure 1).
When signals bypass the visual cortex, any opportu-
nity to understand them is lost, and our response is
based on less precise information. Therefore, when a
stimulus creates a signal that bypasses the visual cor-
tex, a highly emotional reaction typically follows.7
Such a reaction can positively or negatively affect
the performance of an individual and DEMO or her
team. Through the application of EI, BBs can better
DEMO the emotional dynamics within them-
selves and their team and can effectively use emo-
tions to increase team performance.
Further Defining

1. Self-awareness: precisely acknowledging
your own emotions and staying aware of
them as they occur.
2. Self-management: remaining flexible and

3. Social awareness: accurately observing emo-

4. Relationship management: using awareness

In each case, awareness is DEMO To complete pro-

how to effectively manage them while observing
others and managing relationships. The first step in
self-awareness is to understand DEMO various stim-

For example, happiness is DEMO with slow

duces shallow breathing, an increased heart rate, a
tense jaw, DEMO body temperature and sensations

cerns DEMO the MBB. The MBB decided the best
interests of the candidates had been compromised
and they were being victimized and exploited.
He arrived at DEMO conclusion based on past experi-
ences. At a young age, the DEMO had formed a strong
belief that victimization and exploitation were
immoral and should not be tolerated. Consequently,
he was sympathetic to the BB DEMO and was
moved to anger. Had the MBB approached manage-
ment from this position, the resulting discussions
would have been explosive and may have created
barriers to the success of the deployment.
The emotionally intelligent MBB DEMO his
sensations—shallow breathing, increased heart
rate, tense jaw and hot body temperature—might
result in behavior disruptive to the group, no mat-
ter how well his intentions were. The MBB made
an effort to become emotionally DEMO and
brought up his concerns with management in a
more constructive manner.
A strong scientific disposition was part of his life
history. Once he DEMO aware of his emotions, he
could draw on his experience as DEMO scientist to ask
questions and acquire more information about the
BB candidates’ concerns. In the end, he was able to
make an informed judgment and remain emotion-
ally committed to the success of the team and DEMO

management’s expectations.

Observing Emotional
Behavior in Others
Once we become self-aware, our focus shifts to
becoming socially aware. That is, we ask how we
can recognize emotions in someone else. Since we
cannot directly feel the DEMO others experience,
we must learn to visually recognize them. Facial
expressions, body posture and tone of voice can
communicate the emotions people are feeling. Table
2 (p. 47) shows types of body posture and DEMO
these nonverbal cues suggest emotionally.10 Table 3
lists some emotions and their relationships to tone
of voice.11
Drawing again from the previous example, the
MBB called a meeting to get a status update for
each of DEMO eight BB projects. It should be noted the
MBB was specifically selected for this role given his
BB experience and ability to work effectively DEMO
people. Through years of experience, the MBB had
learned to recognize DEMO behaviors that would
produce positive or negative outcomes. Essentially,
he was skilled at social awareness and using the
information to effectively manage relationships.
DEMO the start of the meeting, the MBB noticed a
number of DEMO cues from BB candidates indi-
cating defensiveness and rejection. Before begin-
ning, the MBB addressed the emotions exhibited by
the group. Rather than asking for status updates,
the MBB asked team members to describe their
DEMO with the deployment effort. It became
clear they were experiencing strong negative emo-
tions—namely, fear and anger.
It soon came out that because the BB candidates
were still performing their regular duties, they
could not find the time to complete their BB pro-

DEMO The MBB knew management would not
reverse its decision to keep BBs doing their current
jobs. However, if the BBs could not complete their
projects, the deployment effort would be a fail-
ure—BBs would not become certified, improve-
ment goals set out in the strategic plan would not
be realized, and the bottom line would be adverse-
ly affected.
After further investigation, the MBB discovered
the root cause of the negative emotions was not a
lack of support from the business unit managers.
Rather, new product lines had been introduced that
required a lot of the DEMO attention.
The MBB chose to instill a sense of shared pur-
pose among the group to address its concerns. He
asked for possible suggestions DEMO might free
time for the BBs while ensuring the new product
launches were not compromised. The BBs made
their suggestions, and the whole group selected
the top two.
The group then called a meeting with the DEMO
tor of operations to communicate the concerns and
highlight possible solutions. The solutions were
well received and implemented. During the regu-
larly scheduled project DEMO sessions, the MBB
monitored project progression to ensure the solu-
tions DEMO addressed the root problem. The
MBB documented the experience and communicat-
ed the lessons learned.
Solving Problems Using
The EI Strategy
Emotions may be DEMO as an abstract math-
ematical equation. If the circumstance or cause “x”
occurs, the effect is the observed emotion “y.” By
thinking of emotions from this point of view, we
can develop a methodology that addresses emo-
tions scientifically.
The EI strategy is an eight-step roadmap that can
DEMO used to deal with workplace emotions:12
1. Recognize the symptoms that suggest positive
or negative behavior.
2. Define the emotions that create the
DEMO/undesired state.
3. Measure the consequences of the emotions.
4. Analyze the circumstances and identify the
root causes that created the emotions.
5. Implement DEMO validate solutions that improve
the current emotional state by addressing the
circumstances that caused the emotions.
6. Monitor and control the circumstances that
DEMO the emotions.
7. Standardize and document the methods used
to address the circumstances that caused the
emotions.
8. Communicate the lessons learned and inte-
DEMO them into the EI coaching cycle.
The EI strategy can be employed on an individ-
ual level or in the context of a group, leadership
team or organization. When executed properly, the
roadmap addresses circumstances and emotions
that may cause dysfunction in these settings. It is a
disciplined DEMO that views emotions from
a scientific perspective. Through such a perspec-
tive, we can learn from our emotions and substan-
tially increase our EI.
The Results of EI
The MBB in the example skillfully applied EI DEMO
contribute to the success of a Six Sigma project.
He did not adopt the behavior of the BBs, thereby
avoiding any toxic behavior that might affect his
performance and jeopardize the deployment effort.
The MBB was DEMO of his emotions and recognized
how he might respond given his life history. By
choosing to modify his behavior, the MBB drew on
emotions that eased the BBs and enabled them to
come up with a DEMO to their dilemma.
By following the EI strategy, the MBB was DEMO
to use his emotions in a positive and effective man-
ner to solve potentially debilitating situations and
manage relationships for the benefit of the DEMO
uals and the organization.
