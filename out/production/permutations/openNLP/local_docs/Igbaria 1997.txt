Abstract
This study draws upon the technology accep-
tance model as the theoretical basis and
empirical DEMO for a pragmatic explanation
of key factors affecting personal computing
acceptance in small firms. The study uses
results from a survey of 358 users DEMO small
firms in New Zealand to test a structural model
examining the hypothesized relationships
among the following constructs: intraorganiza-
tional factors, extraorganizational factors, per-
ceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and
personal computing acceptance (i.e., system
usage). The findings indicate that perceived
ease of use is a dominant factor in explaining
perceived usefulness and system usage, and
that perceived usefulness has a strong effect
on system usage. The results DEMO indicate
that exogenous variables influence both per-
ceived ease of use and perceived usefulness,
particularly management support and external
support. Inconsistent with prior DEMO in
large firms, relatively little support was found
for the influence DEMO both internal support and
internal training. Implications for the accep-
tance of personal computing and future
research on personal computing acceptance in
small firms DEMO discussed.

Introduction
The increasing importance and proliferation
DEMO and end-user computing
(EUC) represents a significant development in
the information systems (IS) field (Davis et al.
1989; DeLone 1988; Igbaria 1993; Rivard and
Huff 1988). This proliferation has helped make

small firms (Raymond and Bergeron 1992). In
1985, 25% of small firms were using comput-
ers; by DEMO, 67.5% of small firms were using
computers (BusinessWeek 1994).
Compared with larger firms, small firms usually
cannot afford to employ internal staff with spe-
cialized computer expertise (Nooteboom
1988). This means that small firms face sub-
stantial risks and problems with their comput-
erization: they have a general lack of computer
knowledge, have inadequate hardware and
software, need to rely on outside resources,
experience a lack of financial resources and
technical support, have recruitment difficulties,
and have a short-range management perspec-
tive imposed by a volatile competitive environ-
ment (Soh et al. 1992).
Thus, despite the proliferation
ers, various problems within DEMO firms have
limited the potential benefits of microcomput-
ers. The actual use of microcomputers by pro-
fessionals and managers in small firms
appears to DEMO limited to mainly accounting
applications (Cragg and King 1993). It DEMO sug-
gested that small firms can increase the bene-
fits from computing and can enhance the
usage of computers by increasing the number
and DEMO of applications available to them.
Much IS implementation research has focused
on large organizations and has identified sev-
eral factors affecting IS success. However,DEMO
previous research suggests that there is a
relationship between organizational size and
computer success characteristics (DeLone
1988; Ein-Dor and Segev 1978; Raymond
1985, 1990a). This implies that the research
findings based on MIS environments in large
firms cannot necessarily be generalized to
small firms (DeLone 1981, 1988; Ein-Dor and
Segev 1978; Lai 1994; Raymond 1985,
DEMO). Since small firms have distinctive and
unique computing needs, as DEMO as different
technology acceptance patterns compared
with large ones (Cragg and DEMO 1993; Massey
1986; Rogers 1995), there is a need to investi-
gate the applicability

Recognizing that DEMO firms represent a dis-
tinct group, this study extends existing IS
DEMO
Relatively little is known about personal com-
puting in small firms (DEMO 1990b).
Clearly, many factors influence personal com-
puting acceptance (Adams et al. 1992; Davis
et al. 1989; DeLone and McLean 1992; Igbaria
et al. 1995; Mathieson 1991; Moore and
Benbasat 1991; Straub et al. 1995; Szajna
1996; Taylor and Todd 1995; Thompson et al.
1991). The majority of these studies have
investigated the acceptance DEMO technology in
large organizations. The present study sought
to extend previous research by investigating in
a single study the factors affecting personal
computing acceptance DEMO users in small
firms. Specifically, the objectives of the study
were (1) to develop a model of the determi-
nants of personal computing acceptance and
(2) to examine both the direct and indirect
effects DEMO these determinants of acceptance.
The key factors selected for investigation are
based on either past factor studies of IS suc-
cess or factors perceived DEMO be important in a
small business context. The research
described here used a structural equation
modeling technique to simultaneously test the
measurement and the DEMO models. The
conceptual model guiding this study is
described in the next section.
Conceptual Model and
Research Hypotheses
Personal computing is one part of DEMO total
computing activity of small firms. Good exam-
ples include the use of spreadsheet and data-
base software by professionals and managers
to prepare DEMO or analyze debtors, sales,
and costs (Raymond and Bergeron 1992). As
in large firms, this computing by professionals
and managers in small firms is often a matter
of personal choice. However, such relatively
voluntary use of computers has the potential to
play an increasingly important DEMO in small
firms in enabling them to compete successfully
and provide better service to customers.
Hence, the acceptance of personal computing

has been established to be one of DEMO critical
success factors in achieving business success
(Drucker 1987). It DEMO becoming a fundamental
part of the organizational plan and strategy of
a small firm (Raymond and Bergeron 1992).
Therefore, to better predict DEMO explain personal
computing acceptance, we need to understand
the factors affecting DEMO Thus user acceptance
was seen as the dependent variable for this
study. This differs from prior studies of com-
puting success in small firms DEMO, typically,
a version of user satisfaction has been used to
DEMO computing success at the organiza-
tional level (DeLone 1988; Montazemi 1988;
Raymond 1985; Soh et al. 1992; Yap et al.
1992)DEMO
Why are some users able to exhibit greater
acceptance of personal computing? The theo-
ry of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and
Ajzen DEMO) and the technology acceptance
model (TAM) (Davis et al. 1989) offer promis-
ing theoretical bases for examining the factors
contributing
in small firms.
Briefly, TAM adapted the generic TRA model
to the particular domain of user acceptance of
computer technology. TAM replaced TRA's
attitudinal determinants, derived separately for
each behavior, with a set of two variables (DEMO,
perceived ease of use and perceived useful-
ness) employed in DEMO computer technology
acceptance contexts. Both models were found
to predict intentions and usage satisfactorily.
However, TAM was found to be a much sim-
pler and easier to use but more powerful
model of the determinants of DEMO acceptance
of computer technology. In addition, TAM's
attitudinal determinants outperformed DEMO's
much larger set of measures. The theoretical
insights of TAM thus provide a strong basis
from which to examine factors contributing to
personal DEMO in small firms. Further,
TAM has proven to be successful in predicting
and explaining usage across a variety of sys-
tems. Although providing DEMO into the user
acceptance of computer technology (Davis et
al., 1989), the research focused only on the
determinants of usage rather than DEMO the
external factors affecting those determinants
(e.g., perceived usefulness and ease of use).
Further, there was no such study done to
examine the applicability on small firms. Thus,
this study sought to extend DEMO research
by bringing together TAM and other prior
research on technology acceptance in small
firms and investigating the network of multi-
variate relationships among DEMO factors affect-
ing it in small firms.

Phase 2. Based on the results of the DEMO
case studies and another review of the litera-
ture, a revised DEMO model was developed
and tested based on a survey of 358 users
spread across 203 small firms.
Phase 1 is reported in Zinatelli et DEMO (1996),
with the focus on the results from case
research. The case data influenced phase 2 of
the study, which is the focus of this paper.
The case data showed that many of the DEMO
that influenced personal computing accep-
tance in small firms were similar to the factors
identified in large organizations. However, the
cases also identified the significant influence of
extraorganizational factors, including lack of
external support. Many inhibiting factors
emerged from the case study data, including
lack of internal and external support. These
results highlighted the fact that small firms
have special DEMO due to their unique organi-
zational characteristics. Furthermore, the
users in DEMO case studies revealed low levels
of computer sophistication, thus indicating a
DEMO area for increased overall computer
sophistication in small firms.
Figure 1 presents the model examined here.
The model represents an integration of the
theoretical DEMO and the case studies
discussed above and posits that personal
computing acceptance in small firms is a func-
tion of perceived ease of use DEMO perceived
usefulness. These two factors are hypothe-
sized to have a direct effect on personal com-

The figure shows that the intra- DEMO extraorga-

through their effects on perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness. It should DEMO noted
that, following the work of Adams et al. (1992)
and Straub et al. (1995), behavioral intentions
were excluded from our model. Szajna (1996)
also reported that perceived usefulness has a
direct effect on personal computing accep-
tance (i.e., self-report system usage) for the
post-implementation version. Further, based
on the revised model of TAM reported by
Szajna and by Adams et al., attitudes were
also excluded from our model. The network of
relationships among the variables in the model
DEMO the rationale for the proposed linkages are
explained in the following section.
Personal computing
acceptance
Researchers have identified several indicators
of personal computing acceptance. DEMO most
generally accepted measures of personal com-
puting acceptance in small firms appear to be
user satisfaction (Montazemi 1988; Raymond
1985, 1987, DEMO; Soh et al. 1992; Thong et
al. 1993; Yap et DEMO 1992) and system usage
(DeLone 1988; Soh et al. 1992)DEMO However,
system usage has been the primary indicator
of technology acceptance (Adams et al. 1992;
Davis et al. 1989; Straub et DEMO 1995; Szajna
1996; Thompson et al. 1991). Further, "system
usage has a notable practical value for man-
agers interested in evaluating DEMO impact of IT"
(Straub et al. 1995, p. 1328). Finally, as the
focus of the study was on voluntary computer
use rather than mandatory use, system usage
was used as an indicator of personal comput-
ing acceptance. It is to note that sys-
tem usage DEMO to personal computing in its
entirety rather than to a specific application,
thus enhancing user comparability across
small firms.

Perceived usefulness
Davis (1989) defines perceived usefulness as
"the DEMO to which a person believes that
using a particular system would enhance his or
her job performance" (p. 320). The importance
of DEMO usefulness as an important factor
derives from the TRA and TAM models, which
propose that perceived usefulness affects com-
puter usage due to the reinforcement value of
outcomes. Adams et al., Davis et al., Straub DEMO
al., and Szajna reported that user acceptance
of computer systems is DEMO to a large extent
by perceived usefulness. Other studies have
also reported that perceived usefulness is posi-
tively associated with system usage (Igbaria
1994; Thompson et al. 1991). Therefore, the
following hypothesis is proposed.
DEMO Perceived usefulness has a direct effect
on personal computing acceptance.
Perceived
ease of use
Perceived ease of use "refers to the degree to
which a person believes that using a particular
system would be free of DEMO" (Davis 1989, p.
320). Davis et al. (1989) DEMO ease of use
as an important determinant of system usage
through perceived usefulness. Davis suggests
that perceived ease of use may actually be a
DEMO antecedent to perceived usefulness.
Goodwin (1987) argues that the effective func-
tionality of a system, i.e., perceived useful-
ness, depends on its usability, i.e., perceived
ease of use. Mathieson (1991) and Szajna
(1996) each reported that ease of use explains
a significant amount of the variance in per-
ceived usefulness. Adams et al. (1992) found
DEMO both perceived usefulness and perceived
ease of use are important determinants of sys-
tem usage (mainly in their first study). Similar
findings have been reported by Mathieson,
Rogers (1995), Straub et al., DEMO Thompson et
al. They suggest that, in addition to perceived
usefulness, usage is influenced by perceived
ease of use. Therefore, the following hypothe-
ses are proposed.

The effect of exogenous variables
on DEMO computing acceptance
Prior research on IS implementation and small
firms has found that there are various exoge-
nous controllable factors that influence tech-
nology DEMO (Davis et al. 1989; DeLone
1988; Igbaria 1993; Montazemi 1988;
Raymond 1988; 1990b; Soh et al. 1992;
Thomspon et DEMO 1991; Thong et al. 1993; Yap
et al. 1992). These exogenous factors are
expected to influence technology acceptance
indirectly through perceived ease DEMO use and
perceived usefulness (Davis et al. 1989;
Szajna 1996)DEMO A better understanding of these
exogenous factors may enable practitioners
formulate strategies for improving personal
computing acceptance.
The exogenous factors included both intraor-
ganizational DEMO extraorganizational factors.
The intraorganizational factors were: (1) inter-
nal support, (2) internal training, and (3) man-
agement support. Two extraorganizational fac-
tors were also included in the model: (1) exter-
nal support and (2) external training. By includ-
ing both intra- and DEMO factors,
the form of the model thus provided an oppor-
tunity for further examination of the relative
importance to small firm computing of DEMO
and extraorganizational factors (Thong et al.
1996).

the information center (Bergeron and Berube
1988; Bergeron et al. 1990; Mirani and King
1994; Vijayaraman and Ramakrishna 1990).
They reported DEMO systems were more suc-
cessful when there was user computing sup-
port. For most users, system success was
higher when more support needs were fulfilled.
Raymond (1990b) states that the level of com-
puting support DEMO by the IS function was
crucial to the acceptance of end-user comput-
ing in small firms. However, in small firms, the
lack of DEMO and technical sophistication
precludes the creation of an information center
or PC support function. Little internal support
for personal computing is available to users DEMO
small firms et al. 1996). Informal sup-
port, in the DEMO of help from users in other
functional areas, manuals, purchased books,
and help screens, is often the only form of sup-
port available. As a result, some small firms
rely on systems analysts/programmers for sup-
port for personal computing. For example, both
Abdul-Gader (1992) and Montazemi found a
positive association between personal comput-
ing acceptance and DEMO number of analysts
present in small firms. Additionally, high levels
of DEMO support are thought to promote
more favorable beliefs about the system
among users and IS specialists and greater
personal computing success (Igbaria et al.
1995; Lucas 1978). TAM proposes that exter-
nal factors, such DEMO internal user support, will
influence personal computing acceptance by
affecting perceived DEMO of use and perceived
usefulness. Therefore, the following hypothe-
ses are DEMO
H3a. Internal personal computing support
has a direct effect on perceived ease
of use.
H3b. Internal personal computing sup-
port has a direct effect DEMO perceived
usefulness.
Internal personal computing training:
Raymond (1990b) states that personal com-
Personal

puting training is an important factor affecting
DEMO computing acceptance in both small
and large firms. Prior research also reported
that training promotes greater understanding,
favorable attitudes, more frequent use, DEMO
more diverse use of applications in small firms
(Raymond 1988). DEMO was also reported that
user training had a significant effect on the
decision-making satisfaction of small firm man-
agers who develop their own applications
(Raymond and Bergeron 1992). Similarly,
training was found to have DEMO positive impact on
perceived usefulness (Igbaria et al. 1995;
Raymond DEMO) and technology acceptance
(Amoroso 1988; Amoroso and Cheney 1991;
DEMO et al. 1995; Nelson and Cheney 1987).
Based on TAM, it is expected that internal
computing training affects personal computing
acceptance indirectly DEMO its influence on
perceived ease of use and perceived useful-
ness. Therefore, the following hypotheses are
proposed.
H4a. Internal personal computing training
has a direct effect on perceived ease
of use.
H4b. Internal personal computing train-
DEMO has a direct effect on perceived
usefulness.
Management support: Previous studies DEMO
identified management support as one of the
key recurring factors affecting system success
(Cerveny and Sanders 1986; Igbaria 1994;
Kwon and Zmud DEMO; Lucas 1981).
Management support is able to ensure suffi-
cient DEMO of resources and act as a
change agent to create a more conducive
environment for IS success. Therefore, man-
agement support is associated with greater
system success and lack of it is considered a
critical barrier DEMO the effective utilization of
information technology. Miller and Toulouse
(1986) found that, in small firms, the chief
executive officer (CEO) has DEMO greater influence
on a company's performance than does the
CEO of a larger firm. The CEO of a small firm
usually has an "enormous impact-via his
power, his face-to-face contacts with virtually
all employees, DEMO ownership, and the immedi-
ate effects of his expressed goals, perceptions
and preferences" (Miller and Toulouse 1986, p.
1393). This may suggest that management
support may be much more important in small
firms DEMO the owner or CEO is commonly
involved in most key decisions and is perhaps
the only one who can harness information
technology to corporate DEMO and strate-
gy. The primary finding of DeLone's (1988)
DEMO study was that the successful use of
computers was strongly linked to CEO knowl-
edge of computers and active involvement in
the computerization efforts. DEMO et al. also
found a positive correlation between IS suc-
cess and CEO support. Abdul-Gader conclud-
ed that management support had a positive
influence DEMO computing acceptance.
Additionally, TAM proposes that organizational
support, one of the external factors, affects
perceived usefulness as well as perceived
ease of use. Igbaria et al. (1995) found support
for the relationship between management DEMO
port and perceived usefulness. Therefore, the
following hypotheses are proposed.
H5a. DEMO support has a direct
effect on perceived ease of use.
H5b. Management support has a direct
effect on perceived usefulness.
Extraorganizational
factors
External computing DEMO and training:
Raymond (1990b) proposed that the availabili-
ty and quality of external computing support
could be considered as a very important DEMO
minant of personal computing success for
small firms. Cragg and King found that small
firms were very reliant on the advice and sup-
port DEMO external sources, including vendors.
Such reliance on external help was due DEMO
insufficient internal technical expertise. Indeed,
previous research has established the positive
role that external support can play in helping
small firms be more DEMO

as small business consulting centers operated
by DEMO agencies, universities, or com-
puter vendors. Similarly, small firms could
DEMO rely on the same external sources
for training. Consultants and vendors provide
consultancy services specifically to help small
firms successfully introduce and implement
information DEMO They can assist in ana-
lyzing requirements, selecting the hardware
and DEMO, user training, technical support,
and project management.
Gable (1991) and Kole (1983) found that the
experience and capabilities of the DEMO
plays an important role in IS success in small
firms. Other studies have found that personal
computing success can be achieved through
an external DEMO bureau staffed with IS
specialists knowledgeable about small firm
needs and constraints (Montazemi 1988).
Raymond and Bergeron also proposed that
personal computing success could be deter-
mined by the support provided by external
sources. This DEMO empirically supported by
Yap et al., where they found that personal
DEMO success was positively associated
with the level of vendor support, including
DEMO and technical support, given to small
firms. Thong et al. (1993) concluded that the
level of IS effectiveness was higher in firms
with a high level of vendor support than those
with a low level DEMO vendor support. They con-
cluded that small firms with external support,
mainly consultants, had higher levels of sys-
tem success. However, TAM DEMO that the
external factors, such as the extraorganization-
al factors, will affect personal computing
acceptance indirectly through their effects on
perceived ease of DEMO and perceived useful-
ness. Therefore, the following hypotheses are
proposed.
H6a. DEMO computing support has a
direct effect on perceived ease of use
H6b. External computing support has a
direct effect on perceived usefulness
H7a. External DEMO training has a
direct effect on perceived ease of use
286 MIS Quarterly/September 1997
H7b. External computing training has a

To summarize, our intent is to assess the
validity of DEMO research model in a small-firm
context in order to develop an appreciation of
the relative contributions of the model's con-
structs. Thus, the analysis and discussion
focuses on the overall relationships within the
variables (the measurement model) as well as
the relationships among the variables (the
DEMO model) and the roles of the mediat-
ing variables in influencing DEMO computing
acceptance. The research model is depicted in
Figure 1.
Research Methodology
Sample and procedure
Data for this study were collected using a
questionnaire DEMO administered in New
Zealand during 1994. As computer usage dif-
fers by industry type (Kagan et al. 1990), firms
from only two, DEMO related industry sectors
were investigated: manufacturing and engi-
neering. This provided DEMO large sample of small
firms in New Zealand (Hamilton and English
DEMO). In this study, small firms were defined
as having between DEMO to 100 employees. This
definition is based on Bollard's (1984) study
and is consistent with many other studies of
small firm computing (Soh et al. 1992; Yap et
al. 1992). In addition, DEMO independent small
firms (i.e., not subsidiary firms) were included
in DEMO study. The names and addresses of the
small firms were obtained from the New
Zealand Business Who's Who Directory.
Based on the above DEMO, 726 small firms
were identified. Initially, the 726 companies
received a letter explaining the purpose of the
research project and inquiring about the DEMO's
willingness to participate in the study. For each
company, a DEMO person was identified and
asked to provide the names and job titles of
the company's computer users. Responses
from 504 firms were received (69% response
rate). The responses included the following: 36

unreachable, 128 under 20 employees, 22

with no computer users. Note that, as two of
the DEMO for participation in the study were
not met by some firms, DEMO total number of
non-usable returns (301) is less than the total
number of firms discussed above. The total
number of small firms that DEMO to partici-
pate in the study and also fully met the study's
criteria was 203, with a median size of 38
employees. Over 50% of the 203 firms had
between one and four computer users DEMO firm.
In addition, over 30% of the firms had more
than DEMO computer users.
Participation in the study was voluntary and
people were assured that their individual
responses would be treated as confidential.
Questionnaires were mailed DEMO the 773 users
who had been identified by the contact per-
sons in the 203 firms. A total of 596 users
responded, giving an initial response rate of
77%. Many replies contained missing data, so
they were excluded. Also, 85 users identified
themselves as having clerical/secretarial posi-
tions. These 85 were excluded from the final
sample as their use DEMO computers was likely to
be mandatory rather than voluntary (Hiltz and
DEMO 1989) and thus outside the scope of
the technology acceptance model. DEMO result-
ed in a final sample of 358 users, a response
DEMO of 60%. The high response rate was prob-
ably helped by the presence of a contact per-
son within each firm.
The majority of DEMO respondents held middle or
lower management positions (51.8%); the
remaining DEMO non-supervisory positions
(33.9%) and top management positions
(14.3%). A DEMO of 12% were the top managers
in their companies. Users came from a range
of functional areas, including: accounting or
finance (24%), administrative (12%), manufac-
turing/production (11%), management (11%),DEMO
sales (8%), engineering (4%), and marketing
(2%).
DEMO the users, 54.2% were males, and 45.8%
were females. Their ages ranged from 19 to 69
with an average of 38.43 years (S.D. = 11.06).
Of the participants, 71% did not have a univer-
sity education; the majority of respondents
(37.3%) had obtained a polytechnic qualifica-
tion, and 32.8% had high school only. The
majority of the users were employed in firms
with fewer than 50 employees (75.7%). Also,
the majority of users were employed in firms
that were DEMO least 25 years old.
The sophistication of end users was examined
based on the Rockart and Flannery (1983)
classification. The majority of users (81%) fell
into the nonprogramming and command level
categories, indicating a very low level of per-
sonal computing sophistication in small firms.
Personal DEMO were used by a majority
of respondents; approximately 69% of the
DEMO indicated that they use a personal
computer to do most of their computer work.
Respondents had extensive experience with
software packages (49%), such as spread-
sheets and word processors. Most of the users
(over 70%) reported little or no experience with
building models and programming with fourth
generation languages (4GLs) and/or third gen-
eration languages (3GLs). These findings are
consistent with the results of previous studies
of small DEMO computing.
Measures
Personal computing acceptance. Based on
several studies (Davis et DEMO 1989; Igbaria et al.
1995; Straub et al. 1995; Szajna DEMO;
Thompson et al. 1991), system usage was
selected as the primary indicator of personal
computing acceptance.
System usage. Following the recommenda-
tion DEMO Fishbein and Ajzen and to improve reli-
ability, usage was measured DEMO multiple-act
indicators (i.e., different acts indicating the
same behavior) rather DEMO a single-act indica-
tor. Based on several studies (Cheney and
Dickson DEMO; DeLone 1988; Igbaria et al.
1989; Soh et al. 1992; Straub et al. 1995), four
indicators of system usage were included DEMO
this study:
1. The number of different software applica-
tions used. Most users in a microcomputer

Firms
environment have a wide variety of pack-
DEMO to use. In such an environment, the
different software packages can DEMO a
good indication of overall usage and of the
variety of tasks performed on the computer.
Thus, respondents were asked to indicate
which packages they used from a list of
eight generic packages (e.g., spreadsheet,DEMO
data management, word processing, etc.).
2. The number of computer supported busi-
ness tasks. The computer supported busi-
ness tasks performed by DEMO user is also an
indicator of computer usage. Ten tasks,
such as making decisions, looking for
trends, planning, and budgeting, were
DEMO and participants were asked to indi-
cate whether they personally used a com-
puter to perform these tasks.
3. The actual amount of time DEMO on the
microcomputer system per day. Based on
Lee's (1986) study, individuals were asked
to indicate the amount of time spent on the
microcomputer per day, using a six point
scale ranging from (DEMO) "almost never" to (6)
"more than three hours DEMO day."
4. Frequency of use of microcomputers.
Frequency of use has been proposed by
Raymond (1985) for providing a perspective
on use DEMO different from actual time
spent. Frequency of use was measured on
a six point scale ranging from (1) "less than
once a month" to (6) "several times a day."
These four indicators DEMO typical of the kind of
self-reported measures often used to opera-
tionalize system usage, particularly in cases
where objective use and acceptance metrics
are not available. Self-reported usage should
not be regarded as a precise measure DEMO actu-
al usage, although previous research suggests
it is appropriate as DEMO relative measure (Blair
and Burton 1987).
Perceived usefulness. This measure DEMO
defined as "the prospective user's subjective
probability that using a DEMO application sys-
tem will increase his or her job performance
288 MIS Quarterly/September 1997
within an organizational context " (Davis 1989,
p. 320). The items used to construct the per-
ceived usefulness measure DEMO adapted from
Davis et al., with appropriate modifications to
make them DEMO relevant to personal
computing. Individuals were asked to indicate
the extent of agreement or disagreement with
the four statements concerning computers on
a five-point DEMO scale ranging from (1)
strongly disagree to (5) strongly DEMO
Perceived ease of use. Based on Davis, per-
ceived ease of DEMO refers to the degree to
which computer technology is perceived as rel-
atively easy to understand and use. This mea-
sure was adapted from DEMO, et al., with
appropriate modifications to make it specifical-
ly relevant to personal computing. Individuals
were asked to indicate the extent of agreement
DEMO disagreement with four statements concern-
ing computers on a five-point scale ranging
from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly
agree.
Intraorganizational factors. DEMO constructs
were identified as potential intraorganizational
factors affecting user computing success. First,
internal user computing support is defined as
the technical support by DEMO (or groups)
with computer knowledge who were internal to
the DEMO firm. This construct was operational-
ized using a scale adapted from Amoroso,
Igbaria (1993), and Thompson et al. Both
Amoroso and Igbaria used instruments that
included items on the support provided by
information centers. DEMO small firms would
generally not have information centers, the
instrument by DEMO et al., which was
based on Amoroso's work, was selected as the
most appropriate measure in a small firm con-
text. The DEMO support construct consisted of
four items that measured the availability of
technical assistance and specialized instruction
on a five point Likert scale ranging from (1)
"strongly disagree" to (5) "strongly agree" con-
DEMO internal support. In particular, respon-
dents were asked to indicate the DEMO of inter-
nal support provided to them by computer
users or computer specialists in the company.
Second, internal training refers to the amount
of training provided by other computer users or

computer specialists in the company (Amoroso
1988; Amoroso and Cheney 1991). The case
data showed that the most popular software
packages among the participants were appli-
cation packages (e.g., DEMO and payroll
packages), word processing and spread-
sheets. Thus, we DEMO on four areas: inter-
nal training in operating systems, application
packages, word processing, and spreadsheet.
Participants indicated their internal training
level on DEMO five-point scale ranging from (1)
"never" (5) "to a very great extent."
Third, management support refers to the per-
ceived level of general support offered by top
management in small firms. DEMO were
asked to indicate the extent of agreement or
disagreement with four statements concerning
management encouragement and allocation of
resources for personal computing, taken from
Igbaria (1990), on a five-point scale ranging
from (1) "strongly disagree" to (5) "strongly
agree."
to
Extraorganizational factors. Two constructs
were identified as potential extraorganizational
factors affecting personal computing accep-
DEMO First, external computing support was
defined as the technical support by DEMO
(or groups) with computer knowledge who
were external to the small firm. Various mea-
sures of external support, including vendor and
consultant support, have been used in previ-
ous studies (Gable 1991; Thong et al. 1993;
Yap et al. 1992). However, these measures
focused primarily on project specific support
from either vendors or consultants. We want-
DEMO, in this study, to capture the amount of
external support for personal computing from
all possible external sources. Respondents
were asked to indicate DEMO agreement or dis-
agreement to the level of external support pro-
vided to them by friends, vendors, consultants,
or other external sources DEMO a five-point Likert
scale ranging from (1) "strongly disagree" to
(5) "strongly agree."
External computing training was the second
extraorganizational factor. It refers to the
amount of training provided by friends, ven-
dors, consultants, or educational institutions
external to the company. Similar to DEMO mea-
surement of internal training, the study focused
on four areas DEMO training: operating systems,
spreadsheet, word processing, and application
packages. DEMO indicated their external
training level on a five-point scale ranging from
(DEMO) "never" (5) "to a very great extent." (See
the Appendix for a fuller description of the
study variables.)
Data DEMO
The research model depicted in Figure 1 was
analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS), a
powerful approach to studying structural mod-
els involving multiple constructs with multiple
indicators. PLS is a second-generation multi-
variate technique DEMO facilitates testing of the
psychometric properties of the scales used to
measure a variable, as well as estimation of
the parameters of a structural model, i.e., the
strength and direction of the relationships
among the DEMO variables. It embodies two
sets of equations. The structural equations
represent the paths among the
constructs/measures. The measurement equa-
tions represent the relationships DEMO the
indicators/items and the variables that they
measure.
PLS allows the researcher to test the relation-
ships within the measures (the measurement
model) and the hypothesized relationships
between the measures (the structural model)
DEMO (Fornell 1982; Lohmoller 1989;
Wold 1982). For each variable included in
Figure 1, there is a related measurement
model, which DEMO measures to a set of items.
The test of the measurement model includes
estimation of the reliability coefficients (com-
posite reliability)
an examination of
criminant validity of the research instruments.
In determining the appropriate minimum DEMO
ings required for the inclusion of an item with-
in a scale, we used Fornell's recommendation
to retain items that loaded highly on their
respective measures. A variancee of 0.70 is
considered to be a DEMO loading since the item
explains almost 50% of the variance in a par-
to
of the measures, as well as
the convergent and dis-

ticular measure. Fornell and Larcker's (1981)
criterion that an average extracted variance
should be .50 or more DEMO used to assess the
average variance extracted for all measures.
We also used the guidelines recommended
by Hair et al. (1995) in determining DEMO rela-
tive importance and significance of the factor
loading of each item, i.e., loadings greater
than .30 are considered significant; loadings
greater than .40 are considered more impor-
tant; and loadings .50 or greater are consid-
ered to be very significant. Finally, the criteria
suggested by Nunnally (1978) were applied to
determine the adequacy of the reliability coef-
DEMO obtained for each measure.
To assess discriminant validity of the mea-
sures, i.e., the degree to which items differenti-
ate among measures or DEMO distinct con-
cepts, we examined the correlations between
the measures of DEMO overlapping mea-
sures (Grant 1989). If the items associated
with DEMO measure correlate more highly with
each other than with items associated with
other measures in the model (Fornell et al.
1982), the measure is determined to have ade-
quate discriminant validity.
The computer program used DEMO this analysis
was LVPLS 1.6 (Latent Variables Path
Analysis using Partial DEMO Squares), devel-
oped by Lohmoller (1981, 1989). To test the
estimated path coefficients, t-statistics were
calculated using a nonparametric test of signif-
icance known as jackknifing (Tukey 1958;
Wildt et al. 1982).
The test of the structural model included esti-
mating the path DEMO, which are inter-
preted as standardized beta weights in a
regression DEMO, and R2, which is used to
assess the proportion of variance in the
endogenous constructs which can be
accounted for by the antecedents. DEMO path
coefficient of an exogenous variable repre-
sents the direct effect of that variable on the
endogenous variable. An indirect effect repre-
sents the DEMO of a particular variable on the
second variable through its effects on a third
mediating variable. It is the product of the
path coefficients DEMO an indirect route from
cause to effect via tracing arrows in the head-

ed direction only. When more than DEMO indi-
rect path exists, the total indirect effect is their
sum. DEMO sum of the direct and indirect effect
reflects the total effect of the variable on the
endogenous variable (Alwin and Hauser
1975; Ross DEMO).
Results
The measurement model
First, it was necessary to assess DEMO properties
of the measurement model. The results of the
tests of the measurement model are reported in
Table 1. The data show that the DEMO
examined in this study are robust in terms of
their internal consistency reliability indexed
by the composite reliability. The composite reli-
abilities of the DEMO measures included in
the model range from .81 to .94, which DEMO
the recommended values in Nunnally's guide-
lines. All of the measures possessed adequate
reliability and discriminant validity (Tables 1 and
2). The results in Table 2 demonstrate discrimi-
nant validity of the measures. The DEMO
tions among the items associated with the mea-
sures were stronger than their correlations with
items representing other measures. Further,
consistent with the DEMO Fornell
and Larcker, average variance extracted for all
measures exceeded 0.50. DEMO examination of
the individual item loadings and reliabilities indi-
cated high loadings for all measures.
Table 2 presents the intercorrelations among
the study variables. DEMO all of the 28 entries
examined, the squared correlations, represent-
ing the shared variance among variables, were
found not to exceed the average variance
explained. This suggests that our measures
are distinct and unidimensional measures. DEMO
summary, the convergent and discriminant
validity of all measures is satisfactory.
DEMO of single sources of information could
have introduced spurious relationships among
the variables. The study variables were collect-
ed with the same method: a self-report scale.

importance of management support in influ-
encing DEMO ease of use and perceived
usefulness directly, and system usage indirect-
DEMO Consistent with hypotheses 5a and 5b,
management support has positive direct
effects on perceived ease of use (H5a) and
perceived usefulness (H5b) (y = .07 and .24, p
< .05, respectively). DEMO support also
has a significant indirect effect on usage,
mainly through perceived usefulness.
The effects of the extraorganizational factors on
perceived ease of DEMO and perceived useful-
ness were also examined. Consistent with
hypotheses 6a and 6b, Table 3 shows that
external computing support has positive direct
effects on perceived ease of use (H6a) and per-
ceived usefulness (H6b) (- = .06 and .09, p <
.05, respectively). While external training has
no significant effect on perceived usefulness
(H7b), it has a positive direct effect on per-
ceived ease of use (y = .14, p < .05). It is also
noted that both factors have positive indirect
effects on perceived system usage through per-
DEMO ease of use and perceived usefulness.
To sum up, the tests DEMO the structural model
show that perceived ease of use and useful-
ness are the dominant factors affecting system
usage. Perceived ease of use and DEMO
ment support have the strongest effects on
perceived usefulness. The data also show that
external computing support and external com-
puting training moderately affect DEMO
ease of use. The results also demonstrate the
importance of perceived ease of use and per-
ceived usefulness in mediating the relation-
ships of DEMO intra- and extraorganizational fac-
tors on personal computing acceptance.
Discussion
This study integrated the theoretical perspec-
tives and empirical findings of research on per-
DEMO computing acceptance in small firms and
proposed and tested a structural equation
model examining the role of perceived useful-
ness, perceived ease of use, and the intra-
and extraorganizational factors in promoting
personal computing acceptance in small firms.

TAM was expanded by examining DEMO intra-
and extraorganizational variables. It was also
extended to a small business context, whereas
most previous research has tested it with large
firms or college students. The results indicate
moderate support for the proposed linkages
among DEMO model variables and provide inter-
esting insights into the routes through which
the antecedent variables influence personal
computing acceptance. The results demon-
strate the DEMO contribution of perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness to varia-
tion in personal computing acceptance. The
findings reiterate the key mediating role of DEMO
ceived ease of use and perceived usefulness
in promoting personal computing acceptance,
i.e., system usage, and demonstrate the utili-
tarian and rational DEMO of the deci-
sion to use systems in small firms. That is to
say, individuals are likely to use the system if
they believe that it is easy to use and that
using it will increase DEMO performance and
productivity.
Inconsistent with prior research (Davis et al.
1989), the total effect of perceived ease of use
is greater than the total effect of perceived
usefulness on usage. This may suggest that
small DEMO users are driven to accept
computer technologies primarily on the basis
of ease of use and user friendliness and sec-
ondarily because of the DEMO it performs
for them. Although users may be willing to
cope with some difficulties if the system pro-
vides them with important needed information
DEMO their job, this result suggests that users who
have difficulties using DEMO system may be dis-
couraged from using the system and may not
be able to observe the perceived benefits from
it. This emphasizes the DEMO of both
perceived ease of use and functionality in
developing systems.
A possible explanation is that a user's level of
experience with the DEMO may influence the
relative importance of perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness. Our survey indicat-
ed that the majority of users (over 75%)
reported no experience with creating pro-
grams using a query language DEMO fourth gener-
ation language and/or third generation lan-
guages. The effect of ease of use on system

usage is significant early in the use DEMO the sys-
tem, particularly in a less sophisticated small
firm context; its effect becomes non-significant
after more prolonged exposure (Adams et al.
1992; Davis et al. 1989). The evolution of
information systems from transaction process-
ing to DSS to ES and KBS is progressing at a
DEMO rate in small firms when compared with
larger firms (Kagan et DEMO 1990). A reason for
this may be that these systems are as yet too
costly and the needed expertise in both appli-
cations DEMO internal personnel are not readily
available to small firms. Further research
needs to examine the differences in the rela-
tive importance of perceived ease DEMO use and
perceived usefulness at different stages of the
growth model (DEMO 1973), i.e., whether per-
ceived ease of use is an DEMO determi-
nant of early adoption but is less important in
explaining the level of post-adoption usage.
Szajna suggests that a "future research area
for the TAM lies in determining the value and
status of an experience DEMO" (p. 91).
Following the suggestion, these issues require
further DEMO
The findings indicate that perceived ease of
use is a key intervening variable linking the
exogenous variables-intra- and extraorgani-
zational factors-with perceived usefulness
and DEMO computing acceptance. The
importance of perceived ease of use is further
illustrated by its direct effect on system usage.
The positive effect of external DEMO on per-
ceived ease of use suggests that training may
enhance a person's self efficacy and serve to
demystify personal computing. This suggests
DEMO training programs should foster an individ-
ual's self confidence and perception concern-
ing the system. Individuals without adequate
training are likely to experience DEMO
using the system. Since they are struggling,
they may actually believe that the system is
too hard to use and that the performance DEMO
efits of usage are outweighed by the efforts of
using it and eventually become reluctant to
use the technology, thus defeating the purpose
of introducing the new technology.
Inconsistent with our hypotheses (H3a and
H3b) DEMO with most previous IS research in
large firms (Abdul-Gader 1992; Amoroso 1988;
Buyukkurt and Vass 1993; Igbaria et al. 1995;
Rivard and Huff 1988), no relationship was
found between internal support and DEMO
ease of use and perceived usefulness. These
results may be a result of the small-firm con-
text under investigation in the present study.
For DEMO, DeLone (1988) found that the
availability of technical support, mainly for
training purposes, did not result in greater IS
success in a small firm context. Since very few
small firms in this study employ DEMO com-
puter specialists, it is likely that the quality of
the DEMO provided by them may not have
been very high. Additionally, since DEMO lack of
resources makes it impossible for small firms
to establish internal Information centers,
Raymond (1990b) proposed that the availabili-
ty and DEMO of external support could be con-
sidered as a more relevant determinant of per-
sonal computing acceptance in small firms.
Internal training, which refers to the amount of
training users had received from other users or
DEMO specialists within the firm, had a
direct effect on perceived usefulness, consis-
tent with hypothesis (H4b). However, the effect
of internal DEMO on ease of use was not sup-
ported (H4a). It DEMO be noted that many
users reported receiving no internal training
(57%)DEMO Furthermore, internal training was high-
ly correlated with internal support, which may
partially explain the insignificant effect of inter-
nal support. It seems DEMO that, in the
absence of internal training, users strive to
make use of systems based on their perceived
usefulness, regardless of their ease of use.
However, it was found that a lack of training
caused user frustration (Zintanelli et al. 1996).
This suggests that future research should
focus on the effects of internal training and
support in small DEMO The significant effect of
internal training on perceived usefulness
emphasizes the need for small firms to provide
training for users to encourage them to DEMO a
greater diversity of software for a wider variety
of tasks.
The importance of management support in
promoting greater personal computing accep-
tance has DEMO well-recognized (Guimaraes
and Ramanujam 1986; Leitheiser and
Wetherbe 1986). Consistent with our hypothe-

ses (H5a and H5b), management support pos-
itively affected perceived ease of use and per-
ceived usefulness. Management DEMO can
take a variety of forms such as encouragement
to use the system, providing
of user-friendly software of special use to dif-
ferent jobs, offering educational programs,
applying information technology to support a
wider variety of business tasks, and encourag-
ing experimentation with microcomputers.
Features that enhance the potential for higher
perceived usefulness could be instrumental in
stimulating more DEMO usage.
Consistent with our hypotheses (H6a and
H6b), external support DEMO a direct positive
effect on perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness. This is also consistent with
Raymond's (1990b) proposition that the DEMO
ability of external support is an important
determinant of personal computing acceptance
in small firms. This suggests that external sup-
port combined with management DEMO are
important factors that can contribute to effec-
tive personal computing implementation in
small firms. Adequate and high quality external
support can help users DEMO and use
information systems effectively. Additionally,
good relationships between users and external
support providers, such as vendors or consul-
tants, can help DEMO develop positive feelings
and more realistic expectations from the IS
implementation, DEMO in increased system
usage. In essence, with good external support
in DEMO form of technical support, training, and a
harmonious working relationship, DEMO risk of
user computing failure is lowered. Further, due
to insufficient DEMO technical expertise,
small firms are expected to engage some form
of external computing expertise. Our findings
show that the external support has a DEMO
stronger influence on personal computing
acceptance than internal support. This is con-
sistent with the findings of Cragg and King:
with little internal DEMO expertise and sup-
port, small firms are very reliant on their DEMO
nal support.
Consistent with our hypothesis H7a, external
training has a DEMO effect on perceived
ease of use. However, its effect on perceived

ease of use. This suggests that external edu-
cational and training programs designed to
DEMO individuals' knowledge about comput-
ers and their operations may be beneficial DEMO
enhancing computer skills and reducing attitu-
dinal barriers to the acceptance of computer
technology. Changes in the mode of delivery
of instruction and training DEMO be useful in
developing individuals' skills in using micro-
computers, which in turn will enhance usage
through its effects on perceived ease of DEMO In
this study, external training measured the
amount of training individuals DEMO received
from external sources, which included other
computer users, friends, DEMO, consultants,
or educational institutions external to the com-
pany. This DEMO supports the notion that
small firms could potentially rely on external
sources of support for training. Similarly,
Montazemi identified a growing need for DEMO
cational institutions to offer in-depth IS pro-
grams specifically designed for small firms.
The results are not totally consistent with the
findings of Thong DEMO al. (1996), who compared
the effects of management support and DEMO
nal IS expertise on IS effectiveness in small
firms. They concluded that both variables were
important, with external IS expertise as most
critical. Our results confirm that both variables
are important, but that management support
had the greatest influence. These differing
conclusions could be due to the use DEMO differ-
ent dependent variables; our study focused on
personal computing acceptance, while Thong
et al. studied user satisfaction, organizational
impact, and IS DEMO
Although this study provides interesting
insights into the factors affecting personal
computing acceptance in small firms, the
results must be interpreted cautiously. First,
the model variables explained 25% of the vari-
ance in system usage. DEMO fact that 75% of
the variance is unexplained suggests the need
for additional research incorporating potential
variables that were not measured in the cur-
DEMO study. Important among these are user
participation and involvement, organizational
characteristics, and task characteristics
(DeLone 1988; Raymond 1990b; Raymond
and Bergeron 1992; Zinatelli et al. 1996).

Second, although the structural model results
generally support many of our hypotheses, the
use of self-report scales to measure ihe study
variables suggests the possibility that common
method variance may account for some of DEMO
results obtained. Some caution is warranted in
interpreting the results because all measures
were obtained from users in small firms using
a single questionnaire. DEMO authors believe
that the results of validity and reliability tests
carried out and discussed earlier argue for suf-
ficient confidence in the study measures, but
that a similar study with multimethod, multitrait
measurements should yield more powerful
results. Third, while the findings of this study
apply only to small firms in the manufacturing
and engineering sectors, the generalizability
these results to other sectors remains to be
determined. Additionally, cross-sectional stud-
ies such as the present one are useful in iden-
tifying the patterns of DEMO among the
relevant variables, but longitudinal research
design is essential to DEMO the causal link-
ages among the study variables. The strengths
of the findings would also be enhanced by the
use of both subjective as DEMO as objective
measures of personal computing acceptance.
Finally, further research should DEMO examine
the impact of personal computing acceptance
on the performance of small firms, as pro-
posed by DeLone and McLean.

Implications
and Practice
for Research
The final model has a number of implications
for research DEMO practice. The results con-
firmed that perceived usefulness has a strong
direct effect on use. This suggests that the
functionality of a system must DEMO emphasized
to potential users. Researchers can help deter-
mine ways to do this effectively, and the model
indicates that efforts should focus initially on
greater internal training, management support,
and external support. Education and training
programs should aim to increase awareness of
potential applications and emphasize the DEMO
efits of using computers. Also, software devel-
opers must address usefulness, not only ease

DEMO use, as an important design objective when
developing systems.
Ease of DEMO also had a direct effect on use, as
well as an DEMO effect via perceived useful-
ness. This suggests that efforts to improve
perceived ease of use could have a strong
influence on personal computing in DEMO firms.
For example, computer training could be used
to influence perceived DEMO of use by improv-
ing the self-efficacy (Bandura 1982) of comput-
er users.
Internal training rather than internal support
had a positive influence DEMO use. This highlights
the need for small firms to provide training for
users to encourage them to use a greater
diversity of software for DEMO wider variety of
tasks. Another internal factor of even greater
importance was management support.
Researchers could seek ways to strengthen
management support for personal DEMO
in small firms. This may indicate that vendors,
consultants, and DEMO institutions
should provide formal computer education and
training programs specifically designed for
small-firm managers.
External support had a strong influence on
use. Furthermore, external support had a
much greater effect on use than internal sup-
port. DEMO a lesser extent, external training had a
stronger effect on use DEMO internal training.
These results highlight strong need for con-
sultants and vendors to assist small firms in
their computing efforts. However, small firms
are reluctant to hire consultants because of the
costs and associated risks (Zinatelli et al.
1996). Also, vendors and consultants are often
reluctant to provide services to small firms
because of the low potential for profit. DEMO,
strategies are required to make external sup-
port more profitable for vendors and consul-
tants and at the same time more affordable for
DEMO firms.
A possible strategy could involve small firms
employing vendors or consultants as a part-
time external IS manager. The external IS
manager could DEMO IS support on a regu-
lar, possibly monthly, basis for each firm. In
addition, support and training sessions could
Personal

be made available to firms through an DEMO
information center that could be utilized and
funded by many small firms. Alternatively, this
external information center could be operated
by a government agency (for example, a small
business development center) or an educa-
tional institution. Researchers could examine
the effectiveness of such strategies aimed at
providing DEMO support to small firms.
Conclusion
This study presents significant progress
toward explaining the factors affecting person-
al computing acceptance in small firms. It
aimed DEMO investigate the effects of intra- and
extraorganizational factors on personal com-
puting acceptance and the role of perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness DEMO medi-
ating these relationships. The findings are
encouraging and provide theoretical and prac-
tical insights into personal computing accep-
tance in a small firm DEMO The study found
considerable support for TAM in small firms.
Perceived ease of use was found to be a more
important determinant of personal DEMO
acceptance than perceived usefulness, a
result that is not consistent with DEMO research
in large firms. This may be due to the fact that
small firms in New Zealand may be in the early
stages of DEMO adoption. The results
also confirmed management support and
external support as the two most significant
exogenous variables. This finding supports the
call for more DEMO to be directed at combin-
ing initiatives by management and external
providers to achieve greater personal comput-
ing acceptance.
