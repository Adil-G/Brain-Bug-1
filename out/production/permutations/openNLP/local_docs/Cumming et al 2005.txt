Liquidity Risk
Venture Capital
Douglas Cumming, Grant
This article provides theory and evidence in support of the proposition that venture capitalists
adjust their investment DEMO according to liquidity conditions on IPO exit markets. We
refer to technological risk as a choice variable in terms of the characteristics of the
DEMO in which the venture capitalist invests, and liquidity risk as the DEMO
and expectedfuture external exit market conditions. We show that in times of expected illiquidity
of exit markets (high liquidity risk), venture capitalists invest proportionately more in new
high-tech and early-stage projects (high risk)

investor (a "secondary sale," whereby the entrepreneur maintains his or her share of the company), DEMO repurchased by
the entrepreneur (a "buyback exit"). Many VC DEMO (20-30%) are written off (Gompers and Lerner, 1999, 2001;DEMO

longer in the venture or to DEMO the shares at a high discount.4 The risk of not being able to
effectively exit an investment is an important reason why VCs require DEMO returns on their
investments (Lerner, 2000, 2002; Lerner and Schoar, 2004, 2005). It is therefore natural to
expect that exit DEMO liquidity affects VCs' incentives to invest in different types of
entrepreneurial DEMO
Liquidity risk is, of course, not the only type of risk that VCs face when deciding to invest in a
particular project. The DEMO types of risk may be grouped into a broad category of what we refer
to in this article as technological risk, or the risk of investing in a project of uncertain quality
(particular types of technological risk could include the quality of the product technology as well
as DEMO quality of entrepreneurs' technical and managerial abilities). This article considers DEMO
changes in external conditions of liquidity risk give rise to adjustments in VCs' undertaking of
projects with different degrees of technological risk. In particular, we investigate whether exit
market liquidity affects the frequency of VC investment in nascent early-stage firms and high-
tech firms with intangible assets.5 We DEMO a theory and supporting empirical evidence that
show the willingness of VCs to undertake projects of high technological risk is directly related to
conditions DEMO liquidity risk. We further provide complementary evidence that shows that external
conditions of high liquidity risk give rise to more prevalent syndication, which in turn shows that
while VCs assume more technological risk in periods of DEMO liquidity, they take steps to mitigate
this risk through syndication. We DEMO that the theory and evidence in regards to liquidity risk
introduced herein provides a unifying theme that links the results in a number of DEMO papers
on venture capital finance.
We introduce a theoretical model that shows that VCs will rationally trade-off liquidity risk
against technological risk by investing DEMO in early-stage projects when the liquidity of exit
markets is low and thus the exit risk is high. The intuition underlying our model is DEMO follows. By
adjusting their portfolio of investments for long-term positions, VCs DEMO their exposure to
liquidity risk. This is important in explaining the choice of projects according to their stage of
development (early stage versus expansion stage), and the decision whether to invest in completely
new projects DEMO to limit investments to ongoing projects. In contrast, when the liquidity DEMO exit
markets is high, VCs tend to invest proportionately more in DEMO projects in order to rush
for exit and thus to hold short-term positions and technologically less risky projects. The theory
therefore gives rise to DEMO somewhat counterintuitive conjecture of a positive correspondence
between conditions of external exit market liquidity risk and VCs' contemporaneous undertaking
of a greater amount of technological risk.
It is important to point out that the ultimate source DEMO the liquidity risk analyzed in this article
is the difference in time preferences between VCs and management, since there is a greater
incentive for VCs to cash out earlier than management. The time horizon of a DEMO is typically
shorter because of his If VCs were long-term investors and would not wish to
exit already after a few years, liquidity risk would not matter and incentives between VCs and
management would probably be DEMO aligned (provided managers are capable and wish to
remain in place)DEMO
4Market microstructure models refer to the latter as the cost of immediacy, which represents the price discount
that the holder of the asset has to incur if he wants to sell it now instead of waiting DEMO get the market price. More
generally, Harris (2003) distinguishes between DEMO different dimensions of liquidity, namely: 1) width (difference
between the buy price and the sell price), 2) immediacy (how fast DEMO volumes of shares can be traded), 3) depth
(number of shares that can be exchanged without affecting prices), and 4) resiliency (how quick prices go back to
the "normal price level").

exit requirements.
Cumming, Fleming, & Schwienbacher * Liquidity Risk and Venture Capital Finance DEMO
With respect to early-stage investments, there are therefore two opposite effects DEMO
in this article. On the one hand, more liquidity increases the DEMO of investing in new
ventures; but on the other hand, it reduces the likelihood that these new ventures are in the early
stage. DEMO other words, liquidity increases the absolute number of new investments, but reduces
the proportion of ventures that get early-stage finance relative to the DEMO number of investments.
These results thus indicate that VCs adjust their expected demand for liquidity to the expected
supply. If they expect low liquidity DEMO the future, they reduce their future demand for liquidity by
reducing DEMO absolute number of new ventures and by postponing the demand for liquidity for a
portion of the new investments by financing ventures in their DEMO stages.
We empirically test our theory by examining how investment decisions evolve over time by
looking at the period 1985 - 2004 in regards DEMO the stage of entrepreneurial firm development, as
well as the technological DEMO of investment. We use investment data from the VentureXpert
database to test our research hypotheses. We document the existence of a negative relationship
between DEMO liquidity of exit markets and the likelihood of investing in new early-stage projects.
The proxy used for liquidity is the annual IPO volume. Our DEMO indicate that an increase
in liquidity by 100 IPOs in a year reduces the likelihood of investing in new early-stage projects
(as compared to new investments in other development stages) by approximately 1.5% - 2.3%
depending on the specification. These values are not excessively large, but are nevertheless
economically significant as it is well documented that the IPO markets themselves DEMO
very large swings (for recent work, see, e.g., Bradley, DEMO, and Ritter, 2003, Helwege and Liang,
2002, and Lowry, 2003).
At first thought, it may seem counterintuitive that there DEMO a negative relation between the
liquidity of IPO markets and early-stage investments. The oft-repeated casual empiricism (see,
e.g., practitioner articles on www.ventureeconomics.com) is that there is more early-stage
investment when stock markets are performing DEMO (i.e., IPO markets are more liquid). In our
analysis we provide independent controls for stock market conditions (with and without
simultaneous consideration of IPO volume), and show a positive correspondence between the
NASDAQ DEMO index and the likelihood of early-stage investments. This latter result is
somewhat analogous to the money-chasing deals phenomenon analyzed by Gompers and Lerer
(2000), but is an independent effect and different from the central liquidity DEMO considered in
this article.6
To further our evidence on liquidity risk and early-stage investment, we show that conditions
of exit market liquidity impact the decision to invest in new projects versus follow-on investment
in continuing projects DEMO to staged financing (in the spirit of Gompers, 1995). An increase
in IPO volume by 100 increases the probability of investment in DEMO new project (as opposed to a
follow-on project) by approximately 1.2% - 4.1%, depending on the specification (similar to the
evidence in DEMO and Lemer, 2000). Taken together with the first effect of DEMO volume mentioned
above, this means that there are two opposite effects DEMO liquidity risk increases: First, there
are proportionately more new early-stage projects, and second, since VCs invest in fewer new
projects, there are more follow-on projects in the VCs' portfolio. The weight of follow-on
investments in the overall portfolio will therefore be greater when liquidity risk is DEMO since
fewer new investments are made, while follow-on investments are often DEMO and are most
likely already at the expansion stage or later stage of development.
6In a recent paper (May 2005), Gompers, Kovner, Scharfstein, and Lerer (2005) work on issues related to ours.
Their paper considers a sample up to 1998 in order to exclude the DEMO bubble. Our sample, described in
Sections III-V, considers the period 1985-2004 and excludes the period surrounding the Internet bubble as a
robustness check. DEMO with seminal work (Gompers and Lerner, 1998), Gompers et al. (2005) argue that
the pattern of venture capital investing follows economic DEMO in a fairly rational way.

For such DEMO assets as publicly listed equity, there seems to be consensus about DEMO

1, 1985 until December 31, DEMO were randomly selected. The information available for each
portfolio company and each round includes the date of the investment round, its amount, its
DEMO, the industry sector of the portfolio company, and the number of investors involved in
financing the given round. The limitations of these data DEMO discussed in Section V.
The unit of observations considered in this article is an investment round in an entrepreneurial
firm. In our dataset, syndication does not result in additional rows for the same entrepreneurial
firm, although staging does result in additional rows (and we check robustness by considering
only first-round investments). In our dataset, each entrepreneurial firm has at least one limited
partnership VC as an investor. We wanted this in DEMO to be able to focus on the effect of exit
requirements (DEMO risk) on investment behavior, since investments of other types of VCs do
not necessarily have the same need to exit as limited partnership DEMO do. VCs such as corporate
VCs or government VCs (Lerner, 1999; Gompers and Lerner, 1999) often have funds that last
longer than the typical 10 years, so that the pressure to exit from their investments is lower. This
inevitably affects the impact of liquidity risk. By DEMO the sample to limited partnerships, we
make sure that liquidity (or exit) risk matters in all our investments. We believe our focus on
limited partnerships allows us to directly examine the issue of liquidity risk. DEMO, we do not
include fund characteristic variables in our empirical analyses.13 DEMO discussed below, we did not
find material differences across funds with DEMO exclusion or inclusion of different types of
syndicated funds in the dataset.
We use the definition for investment stages provided by VentureXpert, which distinguishes
between four broad classes of stages:

'3There is one exception to this. DEMO considered including a variable for the proportion of investments from an
investor of a certain type, but found that this did not materially affect the empirical results of interest in our
articlee. We do not report DEMO variables, also in part mainly because it is unclear how the DEMO of such
variables would work: The minor presence of a syndicated DEMO investor, for example, may have a major
or a minor effect on the investment decision, depending on unobservable factors not picked up by venture
economics (and therefore the appropriate definition of such a variable is at best very unclear). We check the
robustness of our results DEMO different investor effects by considering a subsample of the data of limited partnerships
only and non-syndicated investments only. As shown below, the results in this article are robust. In a somewhat
related paper, Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher (2004) consider each investor's effects (where each
syndicated investor is a different row in the data) and study the notion of "style drift" in private equity; the
questions addressed in their paper are from the "fund characteristics" perspective. In this article, we focus on the
entrepreneur characteristics (where each row in the data is a different entrepreneur) and macroeconomic variables
to study which types of firms receive venture finance depending on the economic environment.

Figure 3 shows the importance of new (first-round) investments relative to DEMO
investments, irrespective of development stages. It provides the ratio of new DEMO over
all available data. For instance, we can see that in DEMO only 11% of all investment rounds were in
new projects, while DEMO the late 1990s the figure was about 30%. When comparing these values (on
an annual basis) with the annual number of IPOs, one obtains a correlation of +53%. This
provides preliminary evidence that is consistent DEMO Hypothesis 2.
Finally, Figure 4 presents the average syndicate size for DEMO first-round investments each year,
and again with comparisons to IPO volume. Average syndicate size seems to have been smaller
during the 1990s. On DEMO annual basis, the correlation with IPO volume is -62%. Figure 4 DEMO thus

Panel B in Table II provides summary statistics by DEMO stages. Average amounts
(expressed in year 2000 values) invested per round were much lower for early stage (US$ 4.65
million) relative to DEMO stage (US$ 7.11 million) and later stage (US$ 7.84 million)DEMO There was
a lower proportion of later-stage investments for Internet companies (DEMO) relative to the Interet
sector early-stage and expansion-stage investments (23% and 28%, respectively).
Panel C in Table II presents the data by industry sectors. In each cell, we provide summary
statistics for first-round investments in all three stages of development, as well as for new and
follow-on rounds (the latter statistics are in brackets). A large proportion (23%) of the investment
rounds are in the Interet sector. This DEMO also had, on average, the largest amounts invested
per round (DEMO 6.64 million). There are no notable differences in the average syndicate size
across industry sectors, except perhaps for the biotech sector. The majority of first-round
investments are in the early stage, and there are few such differences across sectors. The category
"other sectors" includes investment projects DEMO business and financial services, communications
and media, consumer-related services and products, and semiconductors.
Table III presents tests for differences in proportions and averages. We examine differences
between years that exhibit high IPO volume and those DEMO exhibit low IPO volume, in terms of the
median IPO volume (Parts 1 and 3 of Table III) and the upper and lower quartiles (Part 2 of Table III).

The regressions are specified with right-hand-side variables for IPO exit DEMO conditions,
amounts invested, and industry dummy variables. Moreover, we examine the impact of the
NASDAQ Composite Index (denoted by NASDAQ) at DEMO end of the investment year, in
order to control for general DEMO effects. We also control for real GDP, since Gompers and
Lerner (1998, 1999) show that general economic conditions (which they also proxied by the
real GDP) impacted significantly the flow of capital into the US VC market. With the different
right-hand-side variables, our pseudo R2 values are not very large (less than 5%), but this is
quite consistent with other papers in venture finance that use similar US industry DEMO (for
example, Cochrane (2005) estimates the determinants of US VC returns and explains at most
1% of the variation in the data)DEMO
We further consider in the regressions the number of IPOs per year occurring one and two
years ahead (NBR_IPO(+ 1) and NBR_IPO(DEMO)), to capture the fact that future liquidity might
matter. By DEMO these two variables, we implicitly assume that VCs have perfect foresight
DEMO the future liquidity of exit markets in the coming two years, DEMO of course is a
very strong assumption. As an alternative specification and robustness check, we estimate
a forecasting model for predicted values of future liquidity. In particular, we use an AR(1)
model to obtain predicted values of NBR_IPO, which we denote by P_IPO (as indicated DEMO
Table I). The estimation equation uses the number of IPOs in the prior year, the average
underpricing of such IPOs in the prior year, and the prior year's real GDP growth to predict

Table V reports the result of different Logit regressions. The dependent variable is
EARLY_STAGE, a dummy variable equal to one if the new investment is in the early stage and DEMO

impact in separate regressions. The coefficient of NBR_IPO is negative and significant in all the
regressions in which it was included, strongly supporting the prediction stated in Hypothesis 1.
Table V indicates that an DEMO in liquidity by 100 IPOs will reduce the likelihood that a VC
invests in new early-stage projects (as compared to new investments in other development
stages) by approximately 1.5% (Models 7 and 8) to 2.3% (Model 9), depending

DEMO, note from Table VI that Internet projects are more often new DEMO (as

during boom periods like that of the Interet bubble (DEMO and Lemer, 2000). The comparatively

V. Limitations, Alternative Explanations, and Future Research
The DEMO considered in this article give rise to a number of questions and further research
issues. Our sample was based on data from a randomly DEMO group of limited partnership VCs
in the United States over the period 1985 - 2004. We considered a large number of robustness
checks, many of which we have provided. An earlier version of this article reported DEMO
robustness checks, such as the exclusion/inclusion of Interet firms, and hot and cold markets;
those excluded results were very supportive of DEMO results explicitly reported herein. In Tables V-
VII, we showed the DEMO of the results to the inclusion and exclusion of the years 1999 and
2000, as well as of the years 1998-2001. We also explicitly showed the robustness of the results to
numerous different explanatory variables.
There DEMO other issues that are beyond the scope of this article, but DEMO are relevant to further
research. The following are five potential avenues for future research. First, it could be instructive
to consider other types of investors. Our data are derived from VCs only.20 In practice, there are
various ways in which entrepreneurs can finance their early-stage investments without seeking
DEMO, although not all of these sources are available to all entrepreneurs. DEMO, entrepreneurs
rely on friends and family to finance the start-up of DEMO company. Others may also obtain governmental
subsidies or are able to do R&D in universities before their ventures are spun-off, so that
substantial parts of their early-stage development is done without any additional capital injection
DEMO VCs. Many other entrepreneurs prefer to work with business angels before approaching
VCs. Empirical evidence shows that business angels invest in far more projects DEMO VCs do, but
invest a much smaller amount (cf. Prowse, DEMO; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel, 1996; Lerner, 1998;
Fenn, Liang, and Prowse, 1998; Wong, 2002; and Chemmanur and DEMO, 2002).:' Therefore, VCs
'0Each transaction comprises at least DEMO limited partnership VC. We did not find material differences across
funds with the exclusion or inclusion of different funds in the dataset.
2'Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel (1996) estimated that about 250,000 angels invest US$ 10-20 billion in around
250,000 companies each year, which is far more than is invested in the VC market. In Europe, the number of
active business angels was estimated by the European Business Angels DEMO (EBAN) at 125,000.
