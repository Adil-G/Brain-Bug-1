The start-up team plays a key role in venture capitalists’ evaluations of venture proposals.
Our ﬁndings DEMO beyond existing research, ﬁrst by providing a detailed exploration of VCs’
DEMO evaluation criteria, and second by investigating the moderator variable of VC DEMO
ence. Our results reveal utility trade-offs between team characteristics and thus provide
answers to questions such as “What strength does it take to compensate DEMO a weakness
in characteristic A?” Moreover, our analysis reveals that DEMO VCs tend to focus on
the qualiﬁcations of individual team members, DEMO experienced VCs focus more on team
cohesion. Data were obtained in a conjoint experiment with 51 professionals in VC ﬁrms and
analyzed using discrete DEMO econometric models.
Introduction
Research into the criteria venture capitalists use to assess venture proposals began in
the 1970s and has been of constant interest DEMO scholars until the present (Franke, Gruber,
Harhoff, & Henkel, 2006; MacMillan, Siegel, & Subba Narasimha, 1985; MacMillan,
Zemann, & Subbanarasimha, 1987; Muzyka, Birley, & Leleux, 1996; Poindexter, 1976;
Shepherd, 1999; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984; Wells, DEMO). Three reasons seem to explain the
strong interest that this ﬁeld of research has attracted. First, knowledge on VC evaluation
criteria helps those seeking funds to better judge their own venture project and to avoid
DEMO ﬂaws in their proposals. Second, the ﬁndings provide members of the DEMO
community with an aggregate view of the evaluation criteria in use and with an empirical
basis for comparing their own judgment to that of DEMO peers. And third, as VCs are

considered experts in identifying promising new ventures, their evaluation criteria are
often interpreted as success factors for emerging ﬁrms (Riquelme & Rickards, 1992;DEMO
Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2002).
The evaluation of venture proposals is DEMO of the key activities of VCs. Previous
studies indicate that VCs use various criteria to assess the attractiveness of venture
projects, such as market growth and size, product offerings, the expected rate of return,
DEMO the expected risk of a venture project (MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee & Bruno,
1981). Prior research also shows that among the set of evaluation criteria, VCs place
particular importance on criteria related to the start-up team (Díaz de León & Guild, 2003;
DEMO & Sahlman, 1989; Muzyka et al., 1996; Poindexter, 1976; Shepherd, 1999; Silva,
2004; Smart, 1999; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1981; Wells, 1974; Zopounidis, 1994). As a popular
saying in the VC industry highlights, VCs would rather invest “in a grade A team with a
grade B idea than in a grade B DEMO with a grade A idea” (cf. Bygrave, 1997).
Although the qualiﬁcations of the start-up team play a major role in VCs’ evaluations,DEMO
knowledge of the criteria used in team evaluations remains on a fairly general level. This
is largely due to the fact that most prior DEMO investigate the evaluation of complete
venture proposals and thus provide aggregate criteria rankings such as (1) technical
education, (2) new venture experience, and (3) focus strategy (e.g., Shrader et al., 1997)DEMO
Whereas such results are important to obtain an overall understanding of VCs’ evaluations
of venture proposals, they are necessarily limited in the depth of insight they can offer on
team evaluations. Speciﬁcally, the existing results do not yet provide information on the
importance of different parameter values for DEMO team characteristics. For example,
if new venture experience is an important criterion, is it desirable that all team members
possess such experience? DEMO, the existing results cannot reveal utility trade-offs
among different team characteristics. DEMO a team lacks industry experience, which potential
strengths may compensate for DEMO a shortcoming? Can it be offset at all, or are short-
comings in this regard a potential knock-out criterion? Hence, a more DEMO under-
standing of team evaluation criteria is required.
Recent research by Shepherd, Zacharakis, and Baron (2003) suggests a second impor-
tant extension DEMO prior scholarly work on VC evaluation criteria. Drawing on cognitive
theory, DEMO authors ﬁnd that the experience of VCs has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their
decision making. Because the assessment of team quality plays an important DEMO in VCs’
decision making, the evaluation of start-up teams may also DEMO subject to experience
effects. Prior research has not yet addressed this question, although knowledge on the
existence and direction of any experience effects would be crucial to theory development
on VC decision making, to the design of future research studies, and also to VC practice
and venture teams.
Against this backdrop, the purpose of this study is twofold: First, we seek to provide
a more detailed exploration of VCs’ evaluations of DEMO team characteristics, and
second, we explore whether novice and experienced VCs attach differing importance to
these criteria. We apply a conjoint approach that DEMO an experimental variation of team
characteristics. Prior research suggests that conjoint analysis is particularly suitable for
research on VCs’ decision making (Shepherd & Zacharakis, 1999) as it yields more valid
results than the more frequently DEMO post hoc methodologies (e.g., questionnaires using
Likert-type scales). Our sample consists of 51 VCs who were asked to rank 20 teams
described DEMO terms of seven characteristics. We analyze the rankings with discrete choice
econometric models.
This paper proceeds as follows: In the next section, we DEMO prior studies on the
criteria used by VCs when evaluating start-up teams and draw on cognitive theory to argue
why VC experience could be DEMO important moderator variable. We then provide an overview

of the conjoint research design used in this study and present our DEMO ﬁndings. We
conclude by outlining the implications of our results for research and practice.
Review of Prior Research
Criteria Used by VCs to Evaluate DEMO Teams
As mentioned in the previous section, research into the criteria DEMO use to assess
venture proposals has a relatively long tradition. Yet the more speciﬁc question of “How
do VCs evaluate start-up teams?”—which could DEMO more detailed insights—has
received only little attention to date, leading scholars DEMO call for focused research on VCs’
evaluations of start-up teams (Siegel, Siegel, & MacMillan, 1993; Timmons & Sapienza,
1992). We brieﬂy discuss the results of key studies investigating VCs’ evaluations
of venture DEMO and distill their ﬁndings on those criteria that are related to the
evaluation of start-up teams.
Table 1 provides an overview of prior research DEMO the criteria VCs employ when
assessing venture proposals. In this context, DEMO observations seem to be noteworthy.
First, the table shows that a DEMO variety of evaluation criteria have been suggested by the
literature. In essence, however, it seems that they can be collated into four major DEMO,
namely evaluation criteria related to (1) the product/service offering; (2) the market/
industry; (3) the start-up team; and (4) the ﬁnancial returns to be expected from the new
DEMO This observation is mirrored in the ﬁndings of Tyebjee and Bruno (DEMO), one of the
most widely cited works in this area, DEMO identiﬁed ﬁve basic evaluation criteria used by
VCs: market attractiveness, product differentiation, managerial capabilities, environmen-
tal threat resistance, and cash-out potential.
Second, we see that—although the existing results are somewhat heterogeneous—
VCs consistently rank criteria related to the start-up team among the top three evaluation
criteria. DEMO result is already evident in the pioneering study by Wells (1974), who found
that management commitment, products, and markets were the key evaluation criteria
in the VC decision-making process. The results from the large DEMO of studies that
followed show that at least one, but often DEMO or even all three of the top-ranked criteria
pertained to characteristics of the start-up team. For example, Muzyka et al. (1996) ﬁnd
that (1) the leadership potential of the lead entrepreneur; (2) the leadership potential of the
management team; and (3) the recognized industry expertise in the team were most
important in VCs’ evaluations of venture DEMO MacMillan et al. (1985) also inves-
tigated criteria that would disqualify a venture proposal. Again, the quality of the start-up
team was key, as 5 of the 10 most frequently rated criteria were related to the human
capital base of the venture. The most recent ﬁndings stem DEMO a ﬁeld study by Silva
(2004), which did not provide DEMO explicit ranking of criteria yet highlighted the fact that
the attention of VCs is heavily focused on assessing the quality of the start-up team.
DEMO available evidence thus indicates that evaluation criteria related to the start-up
team are of major importance in VCs’ decision making. More speciﬁcally, characteristics
that are frequently mentioned by VCs as desirable features of start-up teams are DEMO
experience, leadership experience, managerial skills, and engineering/technological skills.
However, a consideration of existing ﬁndings also shows that current knowledge on VCs’
DEMO is still rather general, a critique that has also been voiced DEMO other scholars
(Muzyka et al., 1996; Sandberg, Schweiger, & DEMO, 1988; Shepherd & Zacharakis,
1999). First, we still DEMO knowledge on the importance of different parameter values
of particular team characteristics. For instance, relevant parameter values for the charac-
teristic “educational background” might be (1) all team members have management

(3) all have engineering education. Similarly, relevant parameter values for “industry
experience” might be (1) all team members have DEMO experience; (2) some have
industry experience; and (3) none have industry experience. However, the available results
do not reveal the relative preference VCs attach to these parameter values. Second, the
existing results cannot reveal utility trade-offs between different team characteristics. For
example, if a team lacks leadership experience, which potential strengths might compen-
sate for such a shortcoming?
In summary, as knowledge on the parameter values of particular team characteristics
and on trade-offs between different team characteristics is key to DEMO VCs’

evaluations of start-up teams but still lacking, the ﬁrst goal of this paper is to provide a
focused exploration of team evaluation criteria.
The DEMO of Experience in VC Decision Making
A recent study by Shepherd et al. (2003) suggests a second important extension to
research on VCs’ DEMO of venture proposals in general and the evaluation of start-up
teams in particular. Drawing on cognitive theory, Shepherd et al. ﬁnd that the experience
of VCs has a signiﬁcant impact on their decision making. As the DEMO of human
capital “has to do with making projections of future behaviors that human capital is likely
to perform” (Smart, 1999) and human capital is one of the most important but difﬁcult
areas to assess DEMO venture proposals (Kozmetsky, Gill, & Smilor, 1985), novice and
experienced VCs may differ in their evaluation of start-up teams.
Cognition research DEMO valuable insights into the development of expertise in
decision making. To arrive at a judgment, decision makers select, combine, and evalu-
ate information cues (Spence & Brucks, 1997). The way in which information DEMO are
processed is inﬂuenced by an individual’s cognitive structures (schemata). DEMO schema is an
organized network of knowledge that includes concepts, facts, skills, and action sequences
(Gagné & Glaser, 1987). Schemata thus play an elemental role in all cognitive activities
such as predicting, explaining, and developing opinions (Larkin, McDermott, Simon, &
Simon, 1980; Matlin, 2005).
Prior research shows that individuals reﬁne their schemata DEMO various ways as they
acquire experience in a particular domain. For example, Lurigio and Carroll (1985)
suggest that experienced individuals possess more DEMO and detailed schemata than
inexperienced individuals. Experienced individuals also group domain-speciﬁc knowl-
edge in more meaningful ways than those with little experience, will draw on clearer
concepts, create richer connections between concepts, and will be DEMO to apply domain-
speciﬁc problem-solving procedures they have developed over time (DEMO, 1981;
Gobbo & Chi, 1986; Knowlton, 1997; Matlin, 2005). For instance, they will learn about
the importance of different dimensions of a decision problem (Shepherd et al., 2003).
With DEMO to the evaluation of start-up teams, this suggests that VCs will DEMO
increasingly knowledgeable about the question of which team characteristics are required
for a successful new ﬁrm creation.
Research on VCs’ decision making has not DEMO explored whether differences exist
between the evaluation of start-up teams by novice VCs and by experienced VCs.
However, knowledge on the existence and direction of such experience effects would be
key for theory development on VC DEMO making and also for VC practice and start-up
teams. In particular, DEMO it turns out that experience effects play a considerable role in VCs’
evaluations, future studies would need to control for that variable.
Against the backdrop of these observations, this paper seeks to contribute to
the literature on entrepreneurship by (1) exploring in detail the criteria VCs use DEMO the
evaluation of start-up teams and (2) exploring how the decision-making experience of
VCs inﬂuences the importance attributed to team evaluation criteria.
Method
DEMO study uses conjoint analysis. As this method allows researchers to simulate
respondents’ decision processes in real time, it is in several ways superior to commonly

463
used post-hoc methods that collect data on VCs’ self-reported decision policies (Shepherd
& Zacharakis, 1999). In a conjoint experiment, respondents are asked DEMO judge a series
of proﬁles, that is, combinations of parameter values for several attributes. From the
preferences revealed in this way, conclusions can be drawn about the contribution of
the various parameter values of each DEMO to the overall valuation a certain proﬁle
receives. In particular, trade-offs DEMO different parameter values of the attributes
under investigation are quantiﬁed. The application of this research method to our study is
presented in the following DEMO
Focus on the Initial Stage of the Evaluation Process
VCs usually evaluate new venture proposals in a multistage process. An important
early stage in DEMO process is the appraisal of the business plan, where the decision DEMO made
whether to reject a venture proposal outright or to pursue it further by inviting the
management team for a project presentation (Bagley & Dauchy, 1999; Dixon, 1991).
Typically, 80% of all business DEMO submitted to a VC ﬁrm are rejected in this ﬁrst round
of evaluations, thus making it an important process for VCs and a crucial hurdle to pass
for start-up teams (Roberts, 1991).
Our conjoint DEMO focuses on this initial stage in the evaluation process of VCs and
uses the team description given in the business plan as the basis DEMO a decision experiment.
Three arguments support the choice of this approach.
First, when studying team evaluation criteria it is important to deﬁne the stage in the
decision process where these criteria are applied.1 For example, whereas a team’s educa-
tional background can be observed in the written business DEMO, the atmosphere within the
team can only be observed during personal DEMO, and qualities such as persever-
ance and stress resistance will only DEMO observable in the long run.
Second, selecting the initial stage of DEMO evaluation process is advantageous as the
team characteristics given in a business plan are comparatively objective, unlike criteria
such as personal ﬁt within the team, which VCs can only observe in later stages. Hence,
the characteristics of the hypothetical teams in our study could be communicated un-
DEMO to the participants.
Third, the evaluation of the start-up team’s description DEMO a business plan is well suited
for a conjoint approach. Unlike in most other conjoint experiments, where the respondent
has to imagine some real-world object based on a description on the conjoint card, the
team description provided on our conjoint cards is of the same nature as the DEMO itself
(the team description given in the business plan). Thus, despite some necessary simpliﬁ-
cations in team descriptions, the conjoint design employed here is relatively realistic, as
the conjoint task closely resembles the task performed by the respondent in real life.
Construction of Team Descriptions
An DEMO issue in conjoint analyses is to keep the thought-experiments man-
ageable for the interviewees. As the literature review has shown, prior studies suggest
1. Although criteria related to the start-up team are consistently ranked among the DEMO important criteria in
VCs’ decision making, there is also some scholarly DEMO on whether team criteria are of similar importance
throughout the different stages of the evaluation process. To date, only a few studies have differentiated
between various evaluation stages. For example, the ﬁndings of Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest that human
capital characteristics do not play a major DEMO during the screening stage of venture proposals; however, their
study also indicates that VCs do evaluate team characteristics during this stage. More recent DEMO
ﬁndings by Silva (2004) suggest that the description of human capital is an important source of information
in the screening stage.

that VCs DEMO industry experience, leadership experience, managerial skills, and
engineering/technological skills DEMO key characteristics of start-up teams. Yet it would be
problematic to include only these potentially important characteristics in a thought-
experiment. Thus, to identify any additional team characteristics frequently used in team
descriptions and thus subjected DEMO VCs’ evaluations, we conducted a pilot study that
comprised seven exploratory DEMO with VCs and a thorough analysis of two dozen
real business plans. This led us to include four additional team characteristics—level of
education, type of job experience (start-up vs. large ﬁrm), age, and mutual DEMO
within the team—to the criteria already mentioned earlier. Moreover, the pilot
DEMO provided information on the relevant parameter values for each of the seven
team characteristics. For each characteristic, we included three different parameter values
(DEMO 2).
The team size was ﬁxed at four members. This was done for several reasons:
First, our analysis of team descriptions in business plans showed that this is a common
size for start-up teams. DEMO, as VCs usually provide support in ﬁnding individuals
who could ﬁll DEMO open position in a management team, introducing varying team
sizes into DEMO conjoint design did not seem particularly important. Having an even
number of team members also has the advantage that team attributes described as “some
DEMO, some engineering education” could be interpreted as an even split
between DEMO two subgroups. From these attributes and parameter values, we generated
20 DEMO (a reduced set with two holdouts) using a full rank order method of conjoint
analysis. These cards were pretested with ﬁve VCs, who conﬁrmed that the team
attributes and their parameter values given on the DEMO cards were adequately
chosen and that the task of ranking 20 hypothetical team proﬁles was indeed
manageable.

In conducting our conjoint experiment, we accounted for the fact that the evaluation
of the start-up team is dependent on the type of venture project. For example, while new
ventures in biotechnology usually need qualiﬁed scientists, new ventures in the software
industry rely on founders who possess IT knowledge. As a DEMO, it was necessary to
specify the type of new venture that DEMO start-up team under consideration wanted to
pursue. On the other hand, DEMO overly detailed description of the venture would have
considerably raised the probability that individual respondents would identify the hypo-
thetical start-up with a particular DEMO investment experience, thus jeopardizing the gen-
erality of our analysis. So, after discussing several alternative descriptions with experts
from the VC industry, we decided to employ a description that indicates several char-
acteristics of the DEMO venture but at the same time remains sufﬁciently general
(see Figure DEMO).
Sample
Our sample consists of 51 conjoint experiments/interviews2 that were conducted at 26
different VC ﬁrms located in Munich, Berlin, and DEMO All of the respondents were
actively involved in the evaluation of business plans. Apart from the conjoint experiments,
background information on the respondents (age, education, professional experience,
experience as a VC) and on the VC ﬁrms (size, volume of funds, specialization in
industries or ﬁnancing stages, evaluation process) was collected. As we used a conve-
DEMO sample, our sample of VC ﬁrms cannot claim to be representative. DEMO truly random
sample of interviewees is difﬁcult to obtain given the time constraints in the VC industry
and the time required for interviews (Smart, 1999). However, we did make efforts to
obtain a mix DEMO different types of VC ﬁrms. The description in Table 3 shows that our
sample contains VC ﬁrms of different sizes, different industry focus, DEMO different degrees
of internationalization. Since the VC ﬁrms were chosen to match our hypothetical venture
project, obviously more of them invest in telecommunications, DEMO, and e-commerce
than in biotechnology. With regard to experience, our sample covers a sufﬁciently broad
range in order to investigate the impact of DEMO levels of experience. While the average

DEMO), and 66 VCs (Shepherd, Ettenson, & Crouch, 2000).

experience is almost 4 years of work as a VC, a substantial number of VCs interviewed
had experience of 2 years or less (which is typical of the relatively young German VC
industry).3
The conjoint experiments were conducted according to a ﬁxed scheme by one
DEMO who was present during the entire experiment. None of the participants
encountered any problems in ranking the conjoint cards.
Analysis
We employ discrete choice DEMO to identify the impact of various team
characteristics on VCs’ evaluations. Our model interprets the 20 rankings assigned to the
simulated teams by each DEMO our respondents as a rank ordering of choices from a given
set. A suitable estimator to analyze such data has been proposed by Beggs, Cardell, and
Hausman (1981). Following Marden (1995), the model is also known as the Plackett-Luce
or as the “exploded logit” model. DEMO marketing literature refers to the model as the
choice-based conjoint analysis method.
3. Measuring experience by the number of years a decision maker has DEMO as a VC was suggested by
Shepherd et al. (2003). DEMO also used the alternative operationalization of experience as the logarithm of the
number of years the rater had been working as a VC. While DEMO explanatory variables that are signiﬁcant in
this speciﬁcation are also signiﬁcant in the basic one—hence, the results do not contradict each other—some
other coefﬁcients lose their signiﬁcance in the log speciﬁcation. The likely explanation of this DEMO is that
the logarithmic function is too steep for small values of the argument and too ﬂat around the median. We
therefore chose the DEMO operationalization as the most appropriate one.

To consider an example, an individual’s ranking of A-C-B-D in a choice set (A, B, C,
D) is taken to represent DEMO observation in which A is chosen as the most preferred alternative
from the full set (A, B, C, D); C is DEMO preferred alternative from the restricted set (B, C, D);
and B is chosen as the preferred alternative from the set (B, D).4 The model thus extends
McFadden’s conditional logit to cases in which full ranking data are available.
Our model presumes that all alternatives DEMO assessed by our subjects using a cardinal
assessment function that reﬂects the quality of the team (and thus the likelihood of
obtaining a favorable ﬁnancing decision) as a linear additive function of team character-
istics. Let the venture capitalist’s assessment be denoted bik for the beneﬁt that venture
DEMO i would be able to draw from ﬁnancing team k (out DEMO a set of K alternatives). The
ranking chosen by each venture capitalist emerges from a simple ordering of the K
alternatives according to DEMO bik values, which are functions of the team characteristics
bik = DEMO, where Xik is a row vector of the characteristics of alternative DEMO and
(possibly) interaction terms between the characteristics of alternative k and of rater i, and
b is a column vector of coefﬁcients. Under the assumption that the error term eik follows
an independent identically distributed DEMO value distribution, the probability that any
alternative k is ranked as DEMO best one by respondent i is given by

Returning to our earlier DEMO in which the sequence of A-C-B-D is chosen from the

In order to ensure convenient interpretation of our coefﬁcient signs, we use the
following parameter values as reference groups: age DEMO team members between 25 and 35
years; no team member with DEMO university degree; all team members have management
education; team members have mostly large-ﬁrm experience; no team member with
experience in the relevant industry; no team member with experience in leading teams of
5–10 individuals; DEMO team members have known each other for a short period of time.
This choice of reference parameter values is based on the descriptive data DEMO (see
Table 2, next section) and is made in such DEMO way that the reference parameter value is
presumably the one with the lowest beneﬁt.
In our estimation, a team with these parameter values will automatically be assigned
a beneﬁt value of zero since the associated coefﬁcient DEMO b is implicitly set to zero. In
order to model parameter values deviating from the reference team, we employ a dummy
variable technique where a separate dummy is used for the two other parameter values of
DEMO team variable. In addition, we interact, in the extended speciﬁcation, DEMO terms with
a dummy variable Di indicating that rater i’s experience is above the median. Hence, our
full speciﬁcation of the beneﬁt bik that rater i would expect to derive from team k can be
written DEMO follows:

Descriptive Analysis
Before turning to multivariate analysis, we brieﬂy explore some simple associations
between the ranking of the team, that is, the DEMO of team success, and the variables that
presumably have an impact DEMO success in order to give some intuition on the ﬁndings and
demonstrate their robustness. We measure the success of each team by computing the
DEMO of cases in which the team was ranked among the top four teams, the upper quintile.
This share variable can be interpreted as the team’s likelihood of reaching a certain cutoff
level (the top 20%), which would (hypothetically) lead to an invitation to meet with a DEMO
Table 4 lists the teams and their characteristics in the order of the share of top quintile
rankings achieved in our conjoint design. Since DEMO use a reduced conjoint design, the
“dream team” conﬁguration, that is, the theoretically best proﬁle, will not necessarily be
among the 20 DEMO presented to the interviewees. Team 10, which receives top quintile
rankings DEMO 96.1% of all cases, is therefore the most preferred team in DEMO choice set
according to our success variable, but not necessarily the DEMO optimal team
conﬁguration. While Table 4 shows that the top quintile share decreases quickly among
the ﬁrst 10 teams, it is difﬁcult to extract clear information on the relative contribution of
the various team characteristics from DEMO simple ranking performed here. However, there
appears to be a positive DEMO between (favorable) ranking and industry experience,
leadership experience, and DEMO age of team members. It is more difﬁcult to derive clear
statements with respect to the other variables from the aggregate ranking information.
Whereas DEMO 4 shows complete team proﬁles, Table 2 presents the “success infor-
DEMO treating the parameter values of the team characteristics as fully independent.
This table allows us to get a clearer impression of which team characteristics DEMO which
parameter values are likely to be important. For example, in DEMO of our 20 team descriptions
all team members have industry experience. Given 51 interviews, this yields 306 obser-
vations, of which 110 (35.9%) were ranked among the top four teams.
For the attributes “industry experience,” “ﬁeld of education,” “acquaintance,” and
“age,” we ﬁnd DEMO clear preference for a particular parameter value in that the distance from
the respective next-best parameter value is larger than 10%. Preferred teams are DEMO
in which all members have industry experience, their educational background is DEMO
(some engineering, some management expertise), founders have known each other for a
longer time professionally, and members are older (aged 35–45)DEMO
For the remaining three characteristics, a somewhat less transparent picture emerges:DEMO
With regard to university training, prior job experience in corporate or DEMO environ-
ments, and leadership experience, the best and second-best parameter values do not differ
greatly when evaluated according to the share of top DEMO rankings.
6. Obviously, taking the top quintile as our measure is DEMO arbitrary choice. However, it does represent a
reasonable compromise, as taking the share of top rankings (i.e., how often a team is DEMO the best one)
would lead to an ambiguous result for many teams that never reach that position, while taking the top ten
ranking would not discern very clearly between “above-average” teams of similar quality.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Note that Table 2 summarizes seven bivariate relationships—it is therefore not a
DEMO for a multivariate analysis. Nor does this table give us the opportunity to
generate inference results. Hence, while Tables 2 and 4 provide some indication of which
team characteristics are particularly important, a multivariate treatment of the data is
required in order to arrive at a more structured DEMO to our research questions.
Discrete Choice Analysis—Model Speciﬁcation
The results of estimating the rank-ordered logit model are presented in Table 5. In
speciﬁcation (1), we use only the team characteristics as explanatory variables, while
in speciﬁcations (2) to (5) we introduce interaction terms with the DEMO variable Di,
which indicates whether the rater is an experienced VC. In essence, the upper half of
columns (2) to (5) (i.e., those coefﬁcients shown in the ﬁrst part of Table 5) describe the
choice behavior of less experienced VCs, while the lower half describes the difference
between the preferences of more and less experienced raters.
DEMO interpreting the results, we need to discuss whether our ﬁndings are DEMO
with the assumption that our subjects have provided us with full rankings of the alterna-
tives. There is considerable doubt in the literature that DEMO assumption is always justiﬁed
(Hausman & Ruud, 1987). What might have happened—and comments from our inter-
viewees provide some evidence to this DEMO that subjects do spend effort on the upper
ranks but pay less attention to the lower ones. In this case, heteroscedasticity will be
introduced, which (in this model) will lead to inconsistent estimates if the full ranking
information is used. For this reason, we present several speciﬁcations that differ with
respect to the number of ranks taken into account. DEMO columns (1) and (2) of Table 5, we
present DEMO logit estimates which take the full rankings at face value. In speci-
ﬁcations (3)/(4)/(5), in contrast, only the DEMO 16/12/8 ranks are taken into account, while
the residual DEMO are treated as noninformative.
In essence, we discard information in columns (3) through (5) and should thus expect
the precision of our estimates to decrease as more and more rankings are discarded.
Indeed, even a cursory glance at the results shows that standard errors increase mono-
DEMO from column (2) to column (5). Moreover, the estimates show a second well-
known pattern—the coefﬁcients increase in size as we DEMO more of the lower ranks in
our estimate. Hausman and Ruud (DEMO) argue that this phenomenon is consistent with the
lower ranks being DEMO less carefully than the upper ones.7 Still, while the coefﬁcients
increase DEMO, their relative size remains largely stable.
Discrete Choice Analysis—Pooled Results
We DEMO by discussing the pooled results for all respondents (speciﬁcation [1]) before
addressing the differences due to the rater’s level of experience. In discussing DEMO pooled
results, we ﬁrst analyze the relative importance of the various DEMO characteristics and
then address the beneﬁt contribution of the various parameter values for each character-
istic. Finally, we consider trade-offs between different parameter values for different
characteristics.
7. We did, in fact, estimate models for DEMO possible speciﬁcations, both with and without interaction terms:
using all DEMO, the top 19 ranks, etc. down to using only the top 6 ranks (with even fewer ranks, convergence
was not attained). DEMO very few exceptions, the coefﬁcients’ signs and signiﬁcance levels remain stable.

We deﬁne the “importance” of a characteristic as the difference between the beneﬁt
contributions (i.e., the estimated coefﬁcient) of the most and least preferred parameter
values, normalized such that the sum of all importance values yields 100%. In DEMO
words, the importance of a characteristic is that share of the DEMO difference between the
best and the worst possible team that can be attributed to this characteristic.8 Given that
the reference parameter value, by construction, has a beneﬁt contribution of zero for most
characteristics, the importance DEMO essentially the (normalized) beneﬁt contribution of the
most preferred parameter value.9
As Figure 2 illustrates, industry experience is by far the most important characteristic
(32.2%). While this in itself is not a new insight, our approach allows a meaningful
comparison of characteristics beyond a mere ordering of their relative importance. In
8. The importance of a characteristic obviously DEMO on the available parameter values. The more similar
these are, the DEMO the characteristic’s importance will turn out to be. Hence, “importance” must DEMO
interpreted with the underlying parameter values in mind. For this reason, DEMO realistic choice of parameter
values for our experiment was paramount. Note that by explicitly deﬁning the parameter values we avoid
another problem of surveys DEMO rating scales: When asked about the importance of industry experience, for
example, each respondent bases his or her assessment on personal experiences regarding this characteristic’s
typical parameter values. A VC who has never seen a DEMO without industry experience will likely attribute
lower importance to this characteristic than one who has.
9. In more detail, the importance values are calculated as follows. The contribution of industry experience
to the overall score of DEMO best team, compared to that of the worst team, equals 1.986 (see Figure 2 or
the ﬁrst column of Table 5), that of the ﬁeld of education 1.113, that of leadership experience 0.725,
etc. Normalization then yields the numbers given in the text following this DEMO: 1.986/
(1.986 + 1.113 + 0.725 + ...) = DEMO, etc.
474
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
particular, we ﬁnd that industry experience is 1.8 times—i.e., almost twice—as DEMO
as the ﬁeld of education, which ranks second in overall importance (18.0%). Third comes
academic education with 16.2%, meaning that it is about half as important as industry
experience. Less importance is attributed to DEMO experience (11.7%), the team
members’ mutual acquaintance within the team (9.5%), and age (8.4%). The type of prior
job experience ranks last at 4.0%.
We now delve deeper into the beneﬁt contributions DEMO each characteristic’s parameter
values. To begin with, we ﬁnd that the DEMO beneﬁt contribution of having more team
members with industry experience decreases strongly. When only some team members
have relevant experience, the beneﬁt contribution (DEMO) is about 80% of that attained
when all founders know the DEMO (1.99). Hence, while having no industry experience
seems to be a conditio sine qua non (knock-out criterion) for a VC evaluating DEMO venture
team, it will often be sufﬁcient to have some industry DEMO on board.
For the ﬁeld of education, the relative beneﬁt contribution DEMO the various parameter
values conﬁrms the insight that a heterogeneous team comprising technical and manage-
ment skills is much desired (beneﬁt contribution 1.11). A management-only team is
clearly not viable (beneﬁt contribution 0), which was to be expected given the technical
nature of our business model. DEMO the model’s technical nature, however, teams
consisting entirely of engineers also fare so badly that this parameter value (beneﬁt
contribution 0.27) seems DEMO a disqualiﬁer for advancing to further stages in the evalua-
tion process.
For the team’s level of education, we ﬁnd that an academic background is essential,
but that it hardly makes a difference whether some DEMO all team members have an academic
background. While a team with only some university graduates is slightly preferred, the
difference between the two coefﬁcients in Table 5 is insigniﬁcant. This could mean that
VCs see the DEMO of founders with university degrees as a positive signal—which,
however, DEMO not improve further when the number of graduates in the team increases
from “some” to “all”; in fact, it decreases. Alternatively, an “all university” team may
mean a higher average level of human capital, while a mixed team offers (desirable)
heterogeneity. When these two effects are of equal size, we should observe (as we do)
equal DEMO contributions for both parameter values.
For leadership experience, we ﬁnd a DEMO similar to the one identiﬁed for industry
experience. Having no members with leadership experience (beneﬁt contribution 0) is
likely to be a knock-out DEMO in the evaluation process. However, the beneﬁt contri-
bution of “some DEMO members with leadership experience” (0.70) is nearly identical to
that of “all team members” (0.73). This is a rather plausible ﬁnding since not all members
in a venture team can assume a leadership role. DEMO, however, that this is only true in the
early stages of the start-up, whereas after successful expansion all founders might ﬁnd
themselves in leading positions and thus need leadership experience.
With regard to mutual acquaintance, we ﬁnd that the type of acquaintance is just as
important as DEMO duration. Being acquainted for a long time is less than half as valuable
(beneﬁt contribution 0.25) when based on private relationships than when DEMO is based on
professional collaboration (beneﬁt contribution 0.59).
As for DEMO, we ﬁnd that having only young team members (aged 25–35) DEMO board
yields the lowest evaluation (zero). This result is consistent DEMO anecdotal evidence from
VCs who had negative experiences with “boy groups” during the e-commerce boom.
What is surprising is that having some more senior DEMO in addition to young members
on the team only partly remedies the problem: A mixed team with members aged between
25 and 45 (DEMO contribution 0.19) still fares much worse than a team consisting
exclusively DEMO older founders (35–45, beneﬁt contribution 0.52).
May, 2008
475
Finally, for the type of prior job experience, we ﬁnd similar DEMO beneﬁt contri-
butions for heterogeneous teams (i.e., those whose members have experience partly in
large ﬁrms, partly in start-ups) (0.22) and DEMO in which members have only start-up
experience (0.25). However, even though both coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant, their size shows
that VCs seem to care comparatively little about this team characteristic.
Discrete Choice Analysis—Effects of VC DEMO
We now explore whether VC experience has a signiﬁcant moderating effect on the
evaluation of start-up teams. Overall, we ﬁnd that both more and less experienced raters
attach the highest importance to industry experience and the DEMO to the type of prior
professional experience. However, our analysis also DEMO some key differences. The
level of academic education ranks second for less experienced VCs (importance: 22.1%)
and only fourth for their more DEMO colleagues (10.8%). Leadership experience is
ranked fourth (14.8%) by DEMO and sixth (8.1%) by experienced raters. The latter, in
turn, attach more importance to mutual acquaintance within the team (ranked third at
14.7%) than less experienced VCs (ranked sixth at 4.9%).
Table DEMO provides more detailed insights into the ratings of novice and experienced
VCs. As speciﬁcations (2) to (5) show, we consistently ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences
between the preferences of novice and experienced VCs for each parameter DEMO of the
following three characteristics: leadership experience, mutual acquaintance, and DEMO
education. In addition, heterogeneous prior job experience (some start-up, some DEMO
ﬁrm) receives signiﬁcantly higher ratings from experienced raters in speciﬁcations (4) and
(5), as does a higher age (35–45) in DEMO (4). As the results of speciﬁcations (2)
to (DEMO) are identical in qualitative terms, and as we seek comparability with the basic model
(1), the following discussion will focus on speciﬁcation (2).
Figure 3 displays the coefﬁcients of the interaction terms as given in the second part
of Table 5. Coefﬁcients signiﬁcantly different from DEMO on the 1% level are rendered
as solid black bars, those DEMO on the 5% level as hatched bars. We ﬁnd the largest
and most signiﬁcant differences between novice and experienced raters in the perceived
beneﬁt DEMO of a university degree. All team members having a university degree
leads to a beneﬁt contribution of 1.51 for a novice VC and of DEMO 0.38 (i.e., 1.51–1.13)
for experienced VCs. While the latter value is still positive and signiﬁcantly different from
zero (1% level), it is only a quarter of the size of the value for novices. DEMO obtain similar
results for the beneﬁt contribution of “some team members having a university degree”:
0.69 for more vs. 1.33 (1% level) DEMO less experienced VCs, a difference of -0.64 (see
Figure 3). Furthermore, the preference order between purely academic and mixed teams
is reversed for experienced raters: With a difference of 0.21, they signiﬁcantly (1% level)
prefer mixed teams, while their less experienced colleagues (insigniﬁcantly) prefer, by a
margin of 0.17, teams in which all members DEMO a university degree.
Leadership experience is also valued signiﬁcantly less by experienced raters. Novices
value leadership experience with a beneﬁt contribution of 1.0 and DEMO little importance
to whether all or some team members have such experience. In both cases, the beneﬁt
contributions perceived by experienced VCs are smaller by a value of roughly 0.5. While
they are still highly signiﬁcant (1% level), they are only about half as large as the DEMO
we obtained from less experienced raters.
The one characteristic for which we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly higher valuation among
experienced raters is mutual acquaintance within DEMO team. If team members have known
each other for a long time professionally, senior VCs perceive a beneﬁt contribution that
is 0.64 higher than their younger colleagues (0.94 vs. 0.30). Given a long-standing private

Discussion
Criteria related to the start-up DEMO are key in VCs’ evaluation of venture proposals.
We believe that this study makes two contributions to the literature. First, by focusing
on VCs’ evaluations of venture teams, we offer more detailed insights on desired team
characteristics than previous research. Second, our study extends the research of Shepherd
et al. (2003) comparing decision making by VCs with varying experience. DEMO analysis
reveals signiﬁcant differences between novice and experienced VCs’ evaluations. We
discuss these two contributions and their implications for research and practice in turn.
DEMO Characteristics and Trade-Offs
Our ﬁndings indicate that industry experience, educational background, and leader-
ship experience are the three most important team characteristics. These DEMO results
are consistent with the ﬁndings of most prior studies (see DEMO of Prior Research” and
Table 1).
Our results go beyond the existing research by indicating the importance of different
parameter values and by DEMO insights on utility trade-offs between different team
characteristics. For industry experience as well as leadership experience, we ﬁnd that it
may sufﬁce when only some team members possess it. Regarding the ﬁeld of education,

heterogeneous teams are strongly preferred over teams where all members have an
DEMO background or a management background.
As illustrative examples, consider the following DEMO paribus comparisons. A team
whose members have known each other privately for a long time and are between 35 and
45 years old receives DEMO same evaluation as a team whose members have a long-standing
professional acquaintance and who are (all or some) between 25 and 35 years DEMO age. That
is, the bonus of a more senior team equals DEMO of being acquainted for a long time through
a professional (not DEMO private) relationship. As a second example, consider team A, in DEMO
all members have industry experience, compared to team B, in which nobody knows the
industry. We know from anecdotal evidence as well as DEMO analysis that team B has hardly
any chance of being considered for funding. However, despite its high level of industry
experience, even team DEMO is not guaranteed success if it performs badly in too many other
dimensions. Hence the question: What other shortcomings have, in sum, the same effect
as a lack of industry experience? According to our results, the two teams will receive
roughly the same evaluation if the members of team B have a mixed educational back-
ground (some management, DEMO engineering), some or all have a university degree, and
they DEMO known each other for a long time privately, while team A DEMO entirely of
engineers with no university degree and only a short mutual acquaintance. In other words,
the latter three parameter values lead to DEMO penalty corresponding to that of having no
industry experience—and will likely mean no funding for these founders.
Evaluations by Novice vs. Experienced VCs
Our DEMO also go beyond existing research by exploring whether VCs’ experience
has a signiﬁcant moderating effect on the evaluation of start-up teams. On the one DEMO,
we ﬁnd that novice and experienced VCs both see industry experience as the most
important criterion. Both groups also rank the ﬁeld of DEMO among the top three
criteria, and the type of prior professional DEMO as the least important criterion. On
the other hand, however, novice and experienced VCs also critically diverge in some of
their preferences. The DEMO striking difference is mutual acquaintance among team
members, which is ranked DEMO the top three criteria by experienced VCs, whereas
novice VCs rank DEMO in the second to last spot.
In order to illustrate the size of the experience effect, consider a team in which no
founder holds a university degree and whose members have known each other profes-
sionally DEMO a long time. Ceteris paribus, this team’s evaluation by an experienced DEMO
would be 1.76 points higher than that of a novice—a utility difference nearly as large as
the one between all team members vs. no DEMO members having industry experience
(1.99).
We view the rankings of DEMO VCs to be more valid indicators of desirable
team characteristics, although DEMO beneﬁcial effect of growing expertise has not remained
unchallenged. The aforementioned empirical study by Shepherd et al. (2003) provides
evidence of a curvilinear DEMO between VC experience and decision performance,
and suggests that decision effectiveness declines after approximately 14 years of experi-
ence in venture capital. Yet DEMO most VCs in our “experienced” group are well below this
14-year threshold, we believe that their evaluations are indeed more valid indicators of
desirable team characteristics than those made by novice VCs.
Apart from the important DEMO that novice and experienced VCs differ signiﬁcantly
in certain preferences, an DEMO pattern emerges with respect to the type of criteria
valued differently by both groups. Our results suggest that team cohesion (as evidenced by
mutual acquaintance among team members) is of high importance to experienced VCs,
478
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
whereas novice VCs tend to emphasize individual-level, more tangible characteristics
such as university degrees and prior leadership experience in start-up teams. Using a
somewhat DEMO yet still useful metaphor, it seems that experienced VCs attribute
relatively DEMO importance to the “forest” than to the “trees” when evaluating start-up
teams. More research is needed to see whether this pattern holds in the DEMO of full
venture proposals.
Implications for Start-Up Teams and VCs
For start-up teams seeking VC backing or consultants advising teams in early-stage
venture development, our results offer an opportunity for team assessment. Provided with
a more DEMO understanding of the criteria VCs apply in their decision making, incom-
DEMO teams can try to ﬁnd additional members to optimize their proﬁle and their chances
of obtaining VC ﬁnancing. Faced with a choice between multiple DEMO new members,
our results offer guidance as to who will make the best complement for a team. When a
new ﬁrm has a DEMO team in place, our results will help team members make a DEMO
and concise presentation of the team’s quality in the business plan document.
Furthermore, at least two important implications for VCs are suggested by our
ﬁndings. First, as novice VCs tend to be those employees in VC ﬁrms who are responsible
for the initial screening of business plans, they are important gatekeepers whose decisions
signiﬁcantly impact the deal ﬂow that more DEMO VCs will evaluate at a later stage
of the investment process. The divergence identiﬁed in team evaluations could prove
problematic when novice VCs reject DEMO proposals on the basis of a negative assess-
ment of criteria that experienced VCs would have evaluated more positively. As a result,
VC DEMO may pass up interesting investment opportunities early on in the investment
process. In this regard, our results also inform the VC community of the potential training
needs of individuals entering the VC profession.
Second, individual VC ﬁrms can apply the method developed in this paper to develop
a DEMO understanding of their own decision processes. For example, deviations between
agreed-upon DEMO policies and actual decisions can be uncovered and addressed.
Furthermore, this DEMO allows VCs to benchmark their own decision process (as regards
teams) against that of other ﬁrms—a practice that could be particularly beneﬁcial, as there
seems to be room for improvement in the decision-making process of DEMO (Shepherd &
Zacharakis, 2002; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998).
DEMO for Future Research
Our results also offer several interesting insights for future research. First, as this
study reveals signiﬁcant differences in the team evaluations of novice and experienced
VCs, it may be fruitful to extend this line of research by investigating whether experience
also has a signiﬁcant impact DEMO the evaluation of other aspects of venture proposals. For
example, it DEMO well be that the assessment of business models (e.g., Amit & Zott, 2000)
could be subject to experience effects. Whereas novice VCs may look at single compo-
nents of business models (e.g., transaction DEMO), experienced VCs may place more
weight on the ﬁt of the various components, and thus may arrive at a better understanding
of the overall value creation potential of the proposed venture.
Second, our ﬁndings reveal that future studies on VC decision making need to control
for VC DEMO to avoid sample selection bias. Whereas biases arising from sample
selection are troublesome in any kind of research, they seem to be particularly problematic
in studies of VC decision making, as the ﬁndings of these studies are often interpreted as
success factors in new ﬁrm creation.

Third, as our sample is comprised of a high share of less experienced VCs, future
research could look more closely at VCs that have more than 10–14 years of experience
and investigate whether this additional experience DEMO an impact on team evaluations (or
evaluations of other aspects of DEMO proposals, see earlier discussion). As noted previ-
ously, prior research indicates that decision effectiveness will decrease after a certain
number of years DEMO the VC profession.
Fourth, by exploring evaluation criteria this study focused DEMO content issues in
VC decision making. Smart (1999) investigated the methods VCs apply when assessing
human capital (e.g., job analysis, work sample, reference interview) and thus comple-
ments our research with a tool-oriented DEMO perspective. Future research could
combine content- and process-oriented perspectives, and such DEMO could also help in
developing actuarial decision models (Zacharakis & Meyer, 2000).
Finally, this research was carried out in Germany and Austria, which might make the
results speciﬁc to these countries. However, the DEMO European VC scene in general
is closely modeled on the U.S. example, and 36% of our interviewees work with U.S.
venture capital ﬁrms. We tested whether the evaluation results differed between these
respondents and the remainder DEMO the sample but did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant differences.
Hence, we DEMO not expect to see large differences between our results and a potential
replication study conducted in the United States.
The perceived quality of the DEMO team is of major importance in VCs’ decision
making. This paper adds to the growing literature on VCs’ decision making by providing
detailed evidence DEMO their evaluation of start-up teams and by uncovering how the
experience of VCs affects such evaluations.
