1. Introduction
Many theories of consumer behavior DEMO thresh-
olds and discontinuities. The amount consumers are
willing to pay for a lottery ticket is different than the
amount they will pay to DEMO against a commensu-
rate loss. A threshold occurs at the point where a gain
turns into a loss. Consumers in the market for a DEMO
minivan may not consider offerings above a certain
price because they exceed their budget constraints, or
because past experience has taught them that higher-
priced vehicles are not a good value. When going out
for dinner, the restaurants considered may be very
different than those considered at lunch. DEMO the-
ory, microeconomics, reference prices, and considera-
tion sets all DEMO abrupt behavior changes under
certain discrete circumstances.
Thresholds and discontinuities are problematic for
empirical researchers because they can lead to a
likelihood surface that DEMO not differentiable. In a
discrete-choice model, the presence of a consideration
DEMO leads to abrupt changes in the choice probability
as items move into and out of the set. Gradient-based
estimation procedures, such as Newton-Raphson and
the method of scoring, are not appropriate in these
situations because they require a continuous and dif-
ferentiable likelihood function. Researchers have used
various DEMO to “smooth out” the likelihood by
391
introducing additional parameters and error terms
into the model. We propose an alternative approach
that deals directly DEMO the irregularity of the likeli-
hood surface, preserving the thresholds and DEMO
nuities that are implied by theory.
In this paper we investigate consumers’ use of
screening rules as part of a discrete-choice model.
Alternatives that DEMO the screen are evaluated in
a manner consistent with random utility theory;
alternatives that do not pass the screen have a
zero probability DEMO being chosen. Behaviorally, con-
sumers adopt a “rule” to screen alternatives; this rule
may be the result of previous learning, information-
processing constraints, or solving some previous con-
strained optimization problem. The reduced-form
model we propose is consistent with various theories
presented in the consideration set and DEMO
processing literature.
The proposed model accommodates conjunctive,
disjunctive, and compensatory DEMO rules. It is
formulated for revealed choice data when process
measures or other data, such as acceptable alterna-
tives or attributes, are not DEMO A primary contri-
bution of this paper is the formulation and estimation
of a choice model that reﬂects a discontinuous deci-
sion process. Our DEMO employs the Bayesian
392
technique of data augmentation and uses Markov-
chain Monte Carlo methods DEMO integrate over the
parameter space. The approach has minimal informa-
tion requirements and can handle a large number of
choice alternatives.
The organization of DEMO paper is as follows. In §§2
and 3 we discuss two-stage decision processes and
how they relate to screening rules. In §4 we describe
DEMO modeling approach and how it overcomes difﬁ-
culties associated with a discontinuous likelihood sur-
face. Section 5 introduces an empirical example in the
context DEMO a choice-based conjoint study for a new
camera type. Results are presented in §6, where we
ﬁnd that 92% of the survey respondents use some
form of noncompensatory screening when choosing
among the choice options. Implications DEMO directions
for future research are discussed in §7.
2. Two-Stage Decision Processes
Consumers use various decision rules to simplify
complicated decision tasks. The choice DEMO pro-
posed in this paper is consistent with two-stage
decision processes wherein a subset of product
alternatives is selected from the universal set, and
the ﬁnal product choice is from the reduced set.
Theoretical motivation for DEMO two-stage process can
be found in the consideration set and information-
processing literatures.
The term “consideration set” has been used in var-
ious ways DEMO the marketing literature. Shocker et al.
(1991, p. 183) deﬁne DEMO sets as being “pur-
posefully constructed and can be viewed as con-
sisting of those goal-satisfying alternatives salient or
accessible on a particular occasion.” DEMO, consid-
eration sets are linked to usage occasion. Alterna-
tively, Hauser and Wernerfelt (1990) deﬁne consider-
ation sets as a subset of DEMO that receive serious
consideration during the purchase occasion. Regard-
less of its use, researchers in marketing have gen-
erally operationalized consideration sets as compris-
ing alternatives that survive a screening process (see
Häubl and Trifts 2000).
Consideration sets have been modeled as the solu-
tion to a DEMO optimization problem. Hauser and
Wernerfelt (1990) provide a model where the expected
utility of consumption must exceed the cognitive cost
of evaluation for DEMO alternative to be considered.
Roberts and Lattin (1991) operationalize this approach
using survey data, and Mehta et al. (2003) extend
this structural approach to scanner panel data where
explicit information on consideration sets is DEMO avail-
able. These approaches assume that the overall utility
of the offering determines inclusion in the considera-
tion set (see also Montgomery et al. 2003).
An information-processing view of the consumer
leads to consideration sets DEMO by product
Gilbride and Allenby: A Choice Model with Conjunctive, Disjunctive, and Compensatory Screening Rules
Marketing Science 23(3), pp. 391–406, DEMO INFORMS
attributes, not overall utility. These models typi-
cally have a DEMO effortful ﬁrst stage, followed by a
more comprehensive second stage. Payne (1976) and
Bettman and Park (1980) provide evidence that the
formation of the consideration set is linked to a sub-
set of attributes DEMO that the ﬁnal selection is more
holistic. Bettman et al. (1998) provide an overview
of consumer decision strategies, including the use of
various conjunctive (i.e., intersection) and disjunctive
(i.e., union) rules that DEMO be used for set formation.
Bettman (1979), Shugan (1980), and Bettman et al.
(1990) show that adopting a screening rule DEMO on
a subset of attributes is a rational outcome for a deci-
sion maker willing to tradeoff accuracy against cog-
nitive effort.
Our model DEMO entirely on revealed choices
and can accommodate holistic (i.e., overall utility)
and attribute-based screens. It does not incorporate
information that can be DEMO to determine the process
by which “seriously considered” alternatives are iden-
tiﬁed, nor does it require respondents to identify the
set of alternatives that pass the screen. Hence, it is
a reduced-form model that is consistent with the lit-
erature on consideration sets. To minimize confusion
with prior DEMO, we refer to the set of alternatives
that pass the screening DEMO in a given context as the
choice set.
3. Screening Rules
The screening rules restrict the set of alternatives
that are evaluated for ﬁnal DEMO The alternatives
included in the choice set are identiﬁed with an indi-
cator function, Ixj , that equals one if the decision
rule DEMO satisﬁed and equals zero otherwise. The choice
model can then be written in general form as
Pri = PrVi + i >Vj + j for all j such that (1)
where Vi denotes the deterministic portion of utilityIxj  =1
of choice alternative i	i is the stochastic DEMO and
it is assumed that the stochastic terms are distributed
independently, DEMO denotes a generic argument of an
indicator function (I) that reﬂects the decision rule
applied to the j th offering. Alternative screening rules
DEMO be investigated with the indicator function rela-
tionship, Ixj  = DEMO Flexibility exists in the speciﬁca-
tion of this relationship because its complexity does
not increase the complexity of estimating the choice
model, as discussed in §4.
For example, if price is used to screen the alter-
natives so that only offerings above a lower thresh-
old are considered, then Ixj  = Ipricej >.If
an upper threshold for price is present, then neg-
ative price can be used as an argument, DEMO  =

393
I−pricej >. Here,  is a parameter to be esti-
mated. DEMO formulation allows for dynamic choice
sets when an attribute (e.g., price) changes over the
choice history.
A compensatory screening rule is one where the
deterministic portion of the utility of the offering
must exceed a DEMO value to be acceptable.
Compensatory Rule: IVj >=1
(2)
DEMO screening rule is consistent with considera-
tion sets based on consumer optimization models (see
especially Roberts and Lattin 1991). Assuming that
the stochastic portion of utility has an expected value
of 0Vj is the expected DEMO from the offering and 
the cognitive cost of considering an offering.
Two noncompensatory screening rules consistent
with the information-processing literature are also
modeled: conjunctive and disjunctive. Choice sets
formed by a conjunctive decision rule require DEMO an
alternative be acceptable on all relevant attributes for
it to be included. A conjunctive rule is formed by mul-
tiplying indicator functions across DEMO attributes m
of an offering:
Conjunctive Rule: Ixjm >m =1
(3)
m
where xjm is the level of attribute m for choice alter-
native j . The cutoff value, m , is the smallest level
of the attribute that needs to be present for the DEMO
sion maker to consider the offering. If the cutoff value
is smaller than all levels of the attribute, then the
attribute is not used to screen. For nominally scaled
attributes (i.e., 0, 1 attributes), a cutoff value greater
than zero indicates that the attribute is required. DEMO
of the product m , results in a conjunctive combina-
tion of the factors where all components must be sat-isﬁed for the combination to DEMO satisﬁed.
The conjunctive screening rule is consistent with an
elimination-by-aspects screening process. One might
hypothesize that a consumer identiﬁes her most
important attribute and DEMO any alternatives
not exceeding a certain threshold. Then she may move
onto her second-most important attribute, eliminat-
ing any alternatives not exceeding a certain level on
that attribute, etc. Note that the order in which the
attributes are examined doesn’t matter: The end result
is that each attribute must be above a speciﬁc thresh-
old to be considered. This is DEMO to the conjunc-
tive screening rule used in the model.
A disjunctive decision rule is one where at least one
of the attribute levels DEMO acceptable:
Disjunctive Rule: Ixjm >m ≥1
(4)
We DEMO that the conjunctive and disjunctive screen-
ing rules directly relate the choice set to speciﬁc levels
m
of the attributes. Estimates of m will DEMO which
attributes, and what levels, are critical to consumers.
Screening rules consistent with consumer optimiza-
tion (compensatory) and information-processing (con-
junctive and disjunctive) theories have been proposed
to represent two-stage decision making. Our reduced-
form model, Equation (1), however, does not require
that consumers form a choice set ﬁrst, and then
choose from that set. The mathematical representa-
tion is silent on any speciﬁc procedure. However, it
does capture the sharp discontinuity in the underly-
ing behavioral model: Alternatives with unacceptable
attribute levels (or combinations of attributes) have a
zero probability DEMO selection. A method for estimating
the model is discussed next.
4. Estimating Choice Models with
Screening Rules
Consideration or choice-set models have been applied
DEMO a variety of domains, including the analysis of sur-
vey data (Gensch 1987), scanner panel data (Manrai
and Andrews 1998), and data collected in laboratory
settings (Johnson and Meyer 1984). Johnson et al.
(1989) and Andrews and Manrai (1998) demonstrate
that parameter DEMO and incorrect inferences result
when the decision process is not correctly modeled.
Choice sets induce a complicated structure in the
likelihood function. Consider, for example, a simple
discrete-choice model without choice sets. The choice
probability is
Pri = PrVi + i >Vj +
= Pr	j <Vi −Vj DEMO
j for all j
i for all j
Vi −Vm+ i
··· −
d	mf

f	j  ···
d	i 
=
+ Vi −Vj DEMO
−
−
i
f	md	j ···
(5)
where Vi denotes the DEMO portion of util-
ity of choice alternative i, i is the DEMO portion,
and it is assumed that the stochastic terms are dis-
tributed independently. The probit model is obtained
by assuming that the stochastic DEMO are distributed
normal, and the logit model is obtained when the
DEMO terms are distributed extreme value. The
discrete-choice probabilities are derived by partition-
ing the domain of the error space corresponding to
a choice outcome, and integrating the error densities
over the corresponding region. The regions for DEMO sim-
ple discrete-choice model are indicated in the upper
and lower limits of the integrals.
The likelihood for an observed sequence of choices
is DEMO product of the choice probabilities:
V  data ≡ data  V =Pri

The likelihood surface for simple discrete-choice
models is continuous and globally concave (Maddala
1983). Small changes in the deterministic portion of
utility V DEMO in small changes in the limits of
integration and small changes in the resulting choice
probabilities. Moreover, unique values of the deter-
ministic portion exist that maximize the probability of
the observed choices. The regularity of DEMO likelihood
surface allows use of gradient-based methods (e.g.,
Newton-Raphson) to solve for values of the determin-
istic portion V that maximize the DEMO
The presence of choice sets destroys the regular-
ity of the likelihood function. As choice alternatives
enter and leave the set, the choice probabilities are
obtained by integrating over an error space of chang-
ing support. DEMO an alternative (k ) to the choice
set results in an DEMO factor in Equation (5),
with an additional stochastic error ( k and appropri-
ate limits of integration. The likelihood surface for a
DEMO model is therefore discontinuous and not
necessarily globally concave.
Researchers have dealt with the nonregularity of
the likelihood surface by writing the probability as
DEMO product of a (conditional) second-stage probabil-
ity and a marginal choice-set probability:
PriC = Pri  C × PrC
(7)
where C denotes the choice set that reduces the
number of alternatives in DEMO (5). The likeli-
hood function is “smoothed out” by summing DEMO
choice sets:
Pri = Pri  C × PrC
(8)DEMO
C
This approach, coupled with the assumption that the
values of DEMO deterministic components Vi  are con-
stant across the choice sets, DEMO in a smooth and
globally concave likelihood surface.
The estimation of choice-set models using Equa-
tion (8) has historically been approached sequen-
tially, sometimes with independent data. Jedidi et al.
(1996) and Roberts and DEMO (1991) have respon-
dents indicate the acceptability of alternatives in a
survey. Ben-Akiva and Boccara (1995) also use sur-
vey data and DEMO a logit model for the choice-set
probability. When independent data are available to
identify the acceptability of an offering, the evaluation
of choice-set models can employ standard maximum-
likelihood techniques.
If independent data are not available DEMO identify the
choice set, it becomes a latent construct that must DEMO
simultaneously estimated with the observed choices.
Complications arise in the evaluation of the choice
probabilities because the partition of the error space
described in DEMO (5) must also be partitioned
with respect to the choice set (see Mehta et al. 2003).
Only one realization of the error vector, , is associ-
ated with each observation, and it is DEMO appropri-
ate to estimate the two components in Equation (7)
DEMO assuming that each are associated with a different
realization.
An alternative to partitioning the error space is to
parameterize and estimate the point mass DEMO each
choice set in Equation (8). Andrews and Srinivasan
(1995) use this approach on scanner panel data,
where the probability for each of the 2J − 1 pos-
sible choice sets is enumerated. DEMO and
Vanhonacker (1996) propose a different likelihood
function where only J (one for each brand) additional
probabilities must be computed. Each of DEMO mod-
els employs a compensatory function to determine
choice-set probability.
One method of dealing with the dimensionality of
the problem is to place a DEMO limits on the allow-
able choice sets. Fader and McAlister (1990) assume
the choice set is either the set of previously purchased
brands DEMO on promotion or all previously pur-
chased brands, and they estimate DEMO probability of
each being the actual choice set. Siddarth et al. (DEMO)
also restrict the number of choice sets to two: the
DEMO set or a subset of brands stochastically
determined based on past purchases.
Chiang et al. (1999) consider Equation (7) as a
hierarchical DEMO model, where the 2J − 1 sets are
assigned a prior DEMO and posterior estimates
of set composition are obtained. While this approach
avoids the complications involved with identifying
suitable partitions of the error space to DEMO prob-
abilities, the choice sets are not linked to the charac-
DEMO of the offerings other than through the fact
that the chosen brand is an element of the set. Choice
sets with high posterior probabilities DEMO offer-
ings that have been chosen and exclude offerings that
have not been chosen.
By contrast, our reduced-form model, Equation (1),
DEMO on screening rules and not on the enumera-
tion of choice sets. The size of the universal set is
not a concern, nor is it necessary to specify a pri-
ori which attributes are being used DEMO screen (e.g.,
price in Mehta et al. 2003 or promotion DEMO Fader and
McAlister 1990) or place limits on the number of DEMO
choice sets. Swait (2001) proposes a different reduced-
form model that is structurally a compensatory model
but mimics various decision rules depending on DEMO
actual parameter estimates. A strength of Swait’s
(2001) model is that it can be estimated using stan-
dard maximum-likelihood techniques. However, it
requires individuals to identify “unacceptable” levels
of attributes, and it cannot estimate the prevalence of
screening in the sample.
Our model structure allows for screening DEMO
natives based on the attribute levels and/or the

overall value of the offering. Attribute level screen-
ing can employ either conjunctive DEMO disjunctive
rules. We navigate the complicated partitioning of
the error space by employing data augmentation and
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC). We
next describe the use of data augmentation to evalu-
ate the standard DEMO model in Equation (5) above.
We then show how this method can be used to esti-
mate choice models with screening rules.
Data DEMO
Direct evaluation of the probability in Equation (5)
can be DEMO in a Bayesian approach to estimation
if the parameters V are augmented with a vector of
latent variables, z (see Tanner and Wong DEMO), where
zi =Vi + i 	i ∼ Normal0 1 (9)DEMO
and the model is written hierarchically:
y  z (10a)DEMO
z  V (10b)
where y denotes the observed choice DEMO Equa-
tion (10a) reﬂects the censoring of the continuous
variables z, where only the offering with the maxi-
mum value of z is revealed to the researcher by the
choice data. Equation (10b) reﬂects DEMO assumption
that the latent variables are normally distributed, with
the mean DEMO each element equal to Vi and variance
one. In marketing applications of the probit model,
the mean is typically parameterized Vi =xi . DEMO
chain Monte Carlo estimation of the probit model pro-
ceeds by drawing iteratively from the two conditional
distributions:
z  yV = Truncated DEMO (11a)
V  z = Normal ¯ /n (11b)
where “” is the identity matrix, and the trunca-
tion in Equation (11a) corresponds to the alternative
selected being the maximum draw. DEMO Vi is parame-
terized as xi , then the mean and DEMO in Equa-
tion (11b) would correspond to the OLS regression
estimate and covariance matrix. Detailed treatments
of estimating the probit model with data DEMO
tion can be found in Albert and Chib (1993), McCul-
DEMO and Rossi (1994), Allenby and Rossi (1999), and
Edwards and Allenby (2003).
The upper limits of the integral in Equation (5)
that complicate the evaluation of the choice proba-
bility are replaced with a much simpler procedure
that involves drawing from a truncated DEMO dis-
tribution. The truncation points correspond to the
limits of integration, DEMO the Markov chain is used
to navigate the domain of the error space consis-
tent with the observed data to arrive at the pos-
DEMO distribution of model parameters. Thus, data
augmentation provides a clever way DEMO avoiding the
estimation of the integral.

Application to Choice Models with
Screening Rules
If an alternative is in the choice set, then its choice
probability is determined relative to the other offer-
ings in DEMO set. If an alternative does not satisfy the
screening rule, then DEMO choice probability is zero. The
choice model can be written hierarchically as
y  z Ix (12a)
z  V (12b)
DEMO iteratively from the conditional distributions:zi =Vi + i , and estimation proceeds by draw-
(13a)
z  y V Ix
  y z x
V  z
(13b)
(13c)
The DEMO distribution in Equation (13a) is a
truncated normal distribution for those items in the
choice set. That is, the element of z for the chosen
alternative is greater than the elements of z that cor-
DEMO to the alternatives not chosen, given that
they are in the DEMO set. If an alternative is not in
the choice set, which DEMO determined by the indica-
tor function Ix, then z is drawn DEMO a nontrun-
cated distribution. Here we assume that Ix does
not involve the deterministic component of utility, V;
changes to the hierarchy to accommodate this screen-
ing rule are discussed below.
The conditional distribution for DEMO cutoff param-
eters,  , in Equation (13b) is dependent DEMO the
observed data, y , and the augmented parameter, z.
The conditional distribution takes the form of an
indicator function because Equation (12a) is a deter-
ministic function that censors the continuous latent
variables z, identifying the considered offering with
the highest value. Variation in the value of the cutoff
parameter changes the set of considered alternatives.
Permissible values DEMO the cutoff parameters are those
that lead to a choice set where the maximum of the
augmented variable, z, corresponds to the observed
DEMO If a value of the cutoff leads to a choice set
where the alternative with the maximum z is not the
alternative chosen, then the cutoff parameter is not
permissible. This can happen because some values
DEMO the augmented parameter in Equation (13a) are
drawn from a truncated distribution while others are
not. Variation in z results in different choice DEMO by
deﬁning the permissible values of the cutoffs.
Finally, the conditional DEMO in Equa-
tion (13c) is identical to Equation (11b). DEMO nor-
mal distribution theory can be used to generate the
draw of V .If V is parameterized as a regression func-
tion, V = X, then draws of  are generated from a

normal distribution with mean and covariance matrix
corresponding to the standard OLS DEMO Details
of the estimation routine for our empirical study,
reported below, are provided in the appendix.
The Markov chain deﬁned by Equations (DEMO)–
(13c) generates draws from the full conditional dis-
tribution of model parameters despite the irregularity
of the likelihood surface. Given the cutoffs,  , the
model (Equation (1)) becomes a standard discrete-
DEMO model. Given the set of augmented variables,
z, some values DEMO the cutoff are acceptable and oth-
ers are not. Across multiple draws of the augmented
variables, however, the acceptable range of  varies,DEMO
and the Markov chain converges in distribution to the
full conditional distribution of all model parameters.
The augmented variable z reﬂects a single error DEMO
that gives rise to the joint probability of the consider-
ation set and the resulting choice.
Recall that our model does not rely on DEMO data
or respondents indicating which alternatives or which
attribute levels are acceptable. Intuitively, the logic for
identifying acceptable levels of the attributes relies
on the revealed choices. If a respondent chooses an
alternative, then the screening rule must be satisﬁed.
The presence of attributes that are common to DEMO
than one choice alternative allows identiﬁcation of
the cutoff parameter,  DEMO Across all alternatives and
choice occasions, there is a set of DEMO, V s, and  s that
are consistent with the revealed choices. We use the
Markov chain to explore the posterior distribution of
DEMO allowable values of these parameters.
The compensatory decision rule requires a change
in the hierarchical model. Because the deterministic
portion of utility, V , is used to determine both the
choice set and the ﬁnal choice, the hierarchy is

The exact form of these conditional distributions
and the estimation algorithm DEMO contained in the
Appendix.
In addition to the form of the screening rule,
researchers can specify that the cutoff parameters ()
take on a limited range of values. If an attribute, x,is
continuous (e.g., price), then  can also be continuous.
However, if the attribute takes on a restricted number
of values, then the cutoff is not well identiﬁed over an
unrestricted range. In a conjoint analysis, for example,
there are rarely more than four or ﬁve levels DEMO an
attribute. In these cases one can assume that the cutoff
parameter takes on a small number of ﬁnite values by
a prior assumption DEMO  is distributed multinomial
over a grid of value and estimate the posterior dis-
tribution of the multinomial mass probabilities. Next,
we explain DEMO approach in the context of our empir-
ical application.
5. Data and Models
The screening rule model is illustrated in the context
of a DEMO conjoint study of consumer pref-
erences for the features of a new camera format, the
advanced photo system (APS). This photographic sys-
DEMO offers several potential advantages over standard
35-mm ﬁlm systems, including midroll DEMO change,
camera operation feedback, and a magnetic layer on
the DEMO that offers the ability to annotate the picture
with titles and dates. These data have previously been
described in Allenby et al. (2002).
Respondents were screened and recruited by tele-
phone and interviewed at ﬁeld DEMO in nine
metropolitan areas. A total of 302 respondents partic-
ipated. The screen was designed to exclude individu-
als who had little or no DEMO in photography, and
retained approximately 55% of the population con-
tacted. DEMO compares to approximately 67% of the
population that owns still cameras (DEMO 1997).
Individuals participating in the study were therefore
assumed to be good prospects for cameras in the price
range of the new APS DEMO and representative of
the APS camera market.
Respondents were asked to evaluate 14 buying
scenarios. The order of the buying scenarios was
randomized. Each DEMO contained full proﬁle
descriptions of three compact 35-mm cameras, three
new DEMO cameras, and a seventh no-buy option.
Table 1 lists the attributes DEMO describe each of the
cameras and identiﬁes the attributes that are new and
speciﬁc to APS cameras. The order of the attributes
was the DEMO in each scenario. Table 1 also displays
restrictions on the availability of certain attributes. For
example, the 4x zoom lens was available only on the
“high” body style. Prices ranged from $41 to $499,
the DEMO price for APS cameras was $247, and the
average price of DEMO compact 35-mm cameras was
$185.
Each buying scenario requires the respondent to
engage in a complex decision. With six offerings
described on eight attributes, plus the no-buy option,
we consider this to be a good DEMO with which
to investigate the use of screening rules. The no-buy
option was selected 14.7% of the time or an average
of 2.1 times DEMO the 14 choice tasks. One of the APS
camera offerings was chosen 39.9% of the time, and
one of the 35-mm cameras was selected 45.4% of the
time. In the analysis that follows, 12 choice tasks per
respondent were used to calibrate the model and the
ﬁnal two DEMO for predictive testing. This results
in 3,624 observations for model estimation and 604
for hold-out validation.

the DEMO conjoint study we use and in real mar-
kets. The ﬁrst model is a heterogeneous probit model
that assumes all choice options are considered DEMO the
respondent. For identiﬁcation, effects-level coding is
used for the nonprice DEMO, with the lowest level
of each attribute (except for body style) set to zero.
Price is parameterized as a natural logarithm. For the
no-buy option, all attributes are set to zero (including
the natural DEMO of price). The effects-level cod-
ing results in 18 parameters, DEMO corresponding to
binary indicator variables and the 18th corresponding
to ln(price). To ﬁx the scale in the probit model, the
error term is assumed to be independent and iden-
tically distributed across choice tasks DEMO unit vari-
ance. The latent continuous variable in our model
setup is therefore

zhi =Xhih + hi	hi ∼ Normal0 
h ∼ Normal ¯ 
(14)

where h indexes the respondent, i is the index for the
buying scenario, and j and k indicate the alternatives
within the buying scenario.
The second model assumes that the choice set DEMO
prises alternatives with the deterministic value of
utility (Vhi =Xhih ) DEMO than a threshold value, h.
That is, the selected alternative has greatest utility of
the options for which Vhik >h:
Prjhi = Przhij >zhik for all k (17)
We allow for heterogeneity DEMO the cutoff value,such that IVhik >h =1 

h  (DEMO)
A weakness in our modeling approach is that sep-
arate “weights” for the screening rule and ﬁnal selec-
tion component of the model DEMO not statistically
identiﬁed. By identifying a separate error term along
with appropriate identiﬁcation restrictions and using
Equation (8), other researchers have allowed for the
“consideration utility” to be different than the “selec-
tion utility” (cf. Andrews and Srinivasan 1995). While
our approach for the compensatory screen DEMO consis-
tent with consumer optimization models, it is less
ﬂexible than DEMO models.
The third model assumes that the choice set is
formed using a conjunctive screening rule over the m
attributes for each alternative:
DEMO = Przhij >zhik for all k
such that m Ixhikm >hm =1
(19)
398
where xhikm is the level of the attribute for respon-
dent DEMO in buying scenario i for alternative k and
attribute m. hm is a respondent-level parameter repre-
senting the threshold, or acceptable level, of DEMO
m for respondent h. We employ two alternative het-
erogeneity distributions for the threshold parameters.
When attribute m is continuously distributed (e.g.,
price), then we employ a normal distribution to allow
for heterogeneity:
DEMO
∼ Normal ¯mm
hm (20)
When an attribute takes on DEMO small number of discrete
levels, we assume that the threshold parameter DEMO dis-
tributed multinomial. For example, consider the zoom
lens attribute in DEMO 1 taking on values of none, 2×,
and 4×. We DEMO the attribute levels (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
and specify a grid of possible cutoffs (e.g.,1.5, 2.5), where the DEMO cutoff value indicates that−0 5, 0.5,
all attribute levels are DEMO, and the highest level
indicatesthatnoneofthelevelsisacceptable.Fornom-
inally scaled attribute levels where a DEMO ordering
is not obvious (e.g., color), the grid has three points
(−0 5, 0.5, 1.5). The full set of attributes, levels, and
cutoffs is contained in Table 5. The distribution of DEMO
erogeneityofthecutoffparameterswithdiscretelevels
is
(21)
hm ∼ Multinomial m
where m is DEMO vector of multinomial probabilities
associated with the grid for attribute m.
The fourth model assumes that the choice set is
formed using a disjunctive DEMO rule:
Prjhi = Przhij >zhik for all k such that

m
The upper and lower grid points specify the role of
the attribute in determining the choice set, depend-
ing on the decision rule. An attribute determines
membership in the choice DEMO only if it changes the
value of the alternative indicator function. For the
conjunctive model, if the threshold for attribute k is
equal to −0 5, then Ixhijk >hk always equals one
and the value DEMO different levels of the attribute do not affectm Ixhijm >hm does DEMO change.
choice sets, we conclude that attribute k is not being
DEMO to screen alternatives. For the disjunctive model,
if hk = 2 5, then Ixhijk >hk always equals zero,
and the value DEMO m Ixhijm >hm does not change
across different levels of attribute DEMO . For the disjunc-
tive model, the upper value of the DEMO implies
no screening based on that attribute. Figure 1 illus-
trates the procedure and the interpretation.
The ﬁfth model assumes that consumers are either

6. Results
The results indicate that the conjunctive model ﬁts
the data best. DEMO and predictive ﬁts of the ﬁve
models are presented in Table 2. The log marginal
density is computed using the GHK estimator (Keane
1994, Hajivassilious et al. 1996) and the importance
sampling method of Newton DEMO Raftery (1994). Hit
probability is deﬁned as the average probability DEMO
ciated with the observed choices. Hit frequency is
the number of times the predicted choice matches the
actual choice. The parameters reported below for DEMO
conjunctive model result in 30% of the alternatives
screened out of the ﬁnal choice set, which averaged
ﬁve (out of seven) alternatives, DEMO the no-buy
option.
Fit results for the other models are as follows. The
ﬁt for the disjunctive model is slightly worse than the
standard DEMO model, with parameters that lead to
only 2% of the alternatives DEMO from ﬁnal consid-
eration. The slight decrease in the log marginal den-
sity for the disjunctive model is from the increase in
the dimension DEMO the model due to the cutoff param-
eters. Although the compensatory model screened out
23% of the alternatives to form the choice set and
DEMO a slightly better in-sample ﬁt than the probit
model, its predictive DEMO is nearly identical. The
structural heterogeneity model assigned nearly all the
respondents (99%) to the conjunctive screening rule
model as opposed to the DEMO model, so the
ﬁt statistics closely match those of the conjunctive
DEMO
The results provide evidence that the conjunctive
model is superior to both the standard probit and

the respondents screen out offerings with the low
DEMO style, 3 =0 059 implies that 5.9% of the respon-
dents DEMO out offerings with low and medium body
style, and 4 =0 DEMO implies that 1.5% of the respon-
dents screen on all alternative levels. Estimates of
equal to approximately 2% reﬂect the inﬂuence of the
prior DEMO and can be disregarded for practical
purposes.
The use of screening rules to form choice sets is per-
vasive among the respondents in this DEMO Anal-
ysis of the individual-level cutoff values indicates
that 92% of respondents form choice sets using the
conjunctive screening rule; 58% are forming choice
sets based on a single attribute, 33% are using
two attributes, DEMO 2% are using three attributes.
A strength of the Bayesian approach outlined in
this paper is the ability to make individual-level
inferences and estimate DEMO only what attributes are
important in forming choice sets, but also DEMO is
using screening rules.
Consider, for example, an aggregate analysis of the
effect of the price threshold, estimated to be equal to
nonconjunctive models. The conjunctive model has
the largest value of the log marginal DEMO Despite
the addition of 11 cutoff parameters per respon-
dent, the DEMO model performs as well as or
better than more parsimonious models in the hold-out
sample. This establishes the predictive validity of the
choice model DEMO a conjunctive screening rule.
Tables 3 and 4 report part-worth estimates for the
probit and conjunctive models. Table 3 displays the
mean and covariance DEMO of the part-worths for
the probit model, and Table 4 reports DEMO same statis-
tics for the conjunctive model. Substantive differences
exist in the part-worth estimates for body style, zoom,
camera setting feedback, and DEMO The conjunctive
model estimates are much smaller for these attributes,
with the average price coefﬁcient moving to zero. The
reason for this difference DEMO discussed below.
The cutoff parameters are reported in Table 5. For
discrete attributes, the cutoffs are reported in terms of
multinomial point mass probabilities associated with
the grid described in Figure 1. The probabilities indi-
cate DEMO fraction of respondents with a cutoff param-
eter ( ) that DEMO out choice alternatives. For the
conjunctive model, 1 =0 598 indicates DEMO 59.8% of

Camera must have

−6 269. DEMO corresponds to an average price thresh-
old of $527. Because the maximum price of an APS
camera is $499, this implies that, on DEMO, respon-
dents are not screening on price. However, such anal-
ysis masks the tail behavior of the distribution of
cutoff values. As displayed DEMO Figure 2, 10% of the
respondents will only consider cameras under DEMO,
20% will only consider cameras under $356, etc. In
all, 41% of the respondents are screening alternatives
based on price.
Figure 3 DEMO the proportion of respondents
screening on each of the attributes. Body style,
zoom, camera settings feedback, and price are the
attributes most DEMO used to screen alternatives.
These attributes are available on both 35-mm and
APS cameras, and as a result respondents are more
fully aware of their beneﬁts. In contrast, none of the
new APS attributes (e.g., midroll ﬁlm change) is being
used to screen alternatives. In addition, DEMO attributes
used to form choice sets have substantively differ-
ent part-worths in Tables 3 and 4. Our results indi-
cate that once the choice DEMO is formed, the price and
body style do not play a DEMO in the ﬁnal decision.
The zoom and camera feedback features, however,DEMO
continue to play a role in the ﬁnal selection of a
camera beyond just screening. Previous authors have
hypothesized that an attribute plays either DEMO role in
the screening phase or the choice phase (Bronnenberg
and DEMO 1996) or that once an attribute is
deemed acceptable it will DEMO no role in the ﬁnal
selection process (see Bettman 1979); DEMO results pro-
vide evidence on this issue.
The participants in the survey were recruited and
qualiﬁed by industry standards so that they were a
DEMO for cameras in the price range of the APS
offering. Despite this prequaliﬁcation, some 41% of
respondents used price to screen alternatives and

old (DEMO = 0 0362). Those respondents that indi-
cated they “almost always” take their camera (44%
of respondents) have an average price threshold DEMO

threshold and may be used in conjunction with the
model to better DEMO prospects in the marketplace.
The empirical results support the conjunctive
screening rule model. Better in-sample and out-of-
sample ﬁt, despite the large increase in the num-
ber of parameters, argue for the use of the screening
rule model over the more parsimonious probit. Con-
sumers tend to screen DEMO using attributes
they are already familiar with, and an exploratory
analysis DEMO conducted to demonstrate how the price
threshold can be associated with other variables in a
posterior analysis. After controlling for their effect in
forming DEMO sets, the importance of the screening
attributes in the ﬁnal choice DEMO acceptable alter-
natives is smaller than that indicated by a standard
probit model.
7. Discussion
In this paper we have proposed a model to DEMO
with an inherently discontinuous model of con-
sumer behavior: two-stage decision DEMO Our
reduced-form model incorporates screening rules that
are consistent with various consideration set and
information-processing theories of consumer behav-
ior. We ﬁnd support for DEMO use of screening rules and
for the conjunctive model in particular. The use of
screening rules is pervasive, with 92% of respondents
using this heuristic to manage the complexity of the
choice problem. The empirical results DEMO show that
consumers screen alternatives using attributes that
are well known, DEMO opposed to the new and novel
attributes also included in this study. Some attributes

others are DEMO in both screening and ﬁnal product
choice. Although previous research has documented
the improved ﬁt of choice-set models and statistical
biases that result from DEMO them, our method can
apply a variety of screening rules and DEMO realis-
tically sized problems. Our ability to capture a non-
compensatory screening process and make attribute-
level inferences for individuals is due to the DEMO
model formulation and estimation technique.
A key element in our model is accurately navigat-
ing the likelihood of the data where only the ﬁnal
DEMO is observed. Past researchers have attempted

to isolate DEMO consideration-set probability PrC in
Equation (7) to create a smooth likelihood surface.
This approach requires a complex partition of the
error space corresponding DEMO the 2J − 1 consideration
sets and the choice probability within each set (see
Mehta et al. 2003). Alternatively, the consideration-set
probability DEMO be estimated by treating each of the
2J − 1 partitions as a model parameter (see Chiang
et al. 1999). By parameterizing the screening rules,
using data augmentation to accurately partition the
error space, and using the Markov chain to navigate
the posterior distribution of all DEMO, we can
estimate a model that has a discontinuous likelihood
function.
DEMO research highlights the beneﬁts and the
potential of research on extended models of choice
(Ben-Akiva et al. 1999). In this research we have
demonstrated that the data are consistent with a two-
stage decision process DEMO decision heuristics
to form choice sets. In an exploratory analysis we
show that the level of the price threshold was related
to a camera DEMO question thought to encompass
varying concerns and interests related to pursuing
photography. It may very well be that the use of any
decision heuristic, which decision heuristic (conjunc-
tive or disjunctive), and/or which attributes to screen
are also related to individual concerns and interests
that may DEMO within an individual across usage occa-
sions or choice contexts. For example, choosing a cam-

era as a gift for a loved one may result in more
effortful decision making DEMO less reliance on deci-
sion heuristics; choosing a single-use camera to DEMO
to the beach may be entirely characterized by a single-
stage lexographic decision process (e.g., the cheapest).
The method proposed in this DEMO can be used to
test various discontinuous decision-making processes
using revealed choice data.
The current study contains several limitations. As
noted earlier, the compensatory model requires the
deterministic component of utility to be the same in
DEMO screening rule and in the compensatory part of
the model. More ﬂexible representations that allow
for a “screening utility” and a “choice utility” may DEMO
the data better. Our empirical application may also be
more prone to identifying screening rules than actual
market situations. The large number of choice DEMO
ios (14), the consistency of the universal set (six alter-
natives plus “none”), and the size of the universal set
may DEMO contribute to the adoption of screening rules
by respondents. In these data, there was very little
evidence that consumers used a disjunctive screening
rule. It may be that more than 12 observations per
individual are necessary DEMO identify the parameters in
this very ﬂexible model.
The methodology presented in this paper can be
extended. Attribute-level thresholds or the propen-
sity to DEMO one decision process over another in the
structural heterogeneity model can be parameterized
as functions of explanatory variables. The Bayesian
hierarchical model would then DEMO expanded by
another level. The conjoint exercise used in this paper
involved six alternatives described on eight attributes,
plus a “none” option. Conjoint DEMO may be
interested to know if the number of alternatives or
attributes inﬂuences respondents’ use of a screen-
ing rule; this question can be studied using the
proposed model and an experimental design that
varies the DEMO of attributes and alternatives. The
model can also be applied to scanner panel datasets
or any other panel dataset that captures repeated
purchase behavior DEMO identiﬁes common attributes
with unique levels. Such a study would reveal the
importance of individual attributes and/or the use of
screening rules in DEMO actual market setting.
Managers frequently deﬁne markets based on par-
ticular attributes (e.g., body style) or price points,
recognizing that certain consumers will only con-
sider offerings with speciﬁc attribute levels, regardless
of other elements of the product offering. Past meth-
ods of identifying these attributes DEMO levels have
tended to rely on compensatory models that may not
be good representations of the decision process. While
compensatory models can often predict DEMO well as
nonlinear models, inferences for strategic decisions
are often biased. DEMO model overcomes the statistical

Appendix. Estimation Algorithm
Equations (13a)–(13c) list the conditional distributions for
estimating the choice model in (12a)–(12b). The estima-
tion for the conjunctive screening process, Equation (3), is
described ﬁrst. Extension to the disjunctive process, Equa-
tion (4), is straightforward. Changes necessary to estimate
the compensatory process, Equations (2) and (13a )–(13c ),
are then described. The standard hierarchical Bayes probit
model (Rossi et al. 1996) and structural heterogeneity mod-
els (Yang and Allenby 2000) have been described elsewhere.
The augmented data problem for the conjunctive model is

We DEMO describe the changes necessary to estimate the

of the model, the deterministic component of utility Vhij =

Steps 3 and 7 from the previous procedure are no longer
needed. Only Steps 2 and DEMO need to be altered:
2a.Again, conditioned on the current values DEMO h  zh, yhXhh for h =1H. zh and h
and DEMO observed data, the key is to draw h from the set
DEMO allowable values. The allowable values of h deﬁne con-
sideration sets such that the chosen alternative always has
the maximum value of z.
If DEMO =1 then xhij h >h/
let B∗ = minxhij h DEMO all i and j where yhij =1
If yhij = 0 and zhij >zhik where yhik =1 then xhij h <h/
let DEMO = maxxhij h for all i and j with yhij =0
and zhij >zhik where yhik =1
Then A∗ <h <B∗ deﬁnes the allowable range for h. A∗
requires that all chosen alternatives be part DEMO the consider-
ation set. B∗ requires that any alternative that is not chosen
but has a value of z greater than the chosen alternative, be
excluded from the consideration set.
Following Chib and Greenberg (1995), we perform a
Metropolis-Hastings step by drawing h directly from the
allowable DEMO of the prior; in our case the prior is the
heterogeneity DEMO and we draw from the truncated
normal distribution:
