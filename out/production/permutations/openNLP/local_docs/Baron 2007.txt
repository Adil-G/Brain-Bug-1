Entrepreneurs play a central role in new venture creation. Because they do, careful attention
to relevant aspects of their behavior and cognition can offer useful insights into DEMO aspects of
this complex process. Speciﬁ cally, investigation of carefully selected DEMO and cognitive
factors can add appreciably to our understanding of the basic processes that underlie new
venture creation (e.g., how opportunity recognition or DEMO actually occurs, how and what
entrepreneurs learn from increasing experience in DEMO and operating new ventures).
Evidence is reviewed concerning the role of behavioral and cognitive factors in several key
activities performed by entrepreneurs. In DEMO, the potential role of a variable that has
not yet been DEMO investigated in the context of new venture creation—affect—is
explored. Finally, suggestions DEMO offered for future research designed to further explicate
the role of behavioral and cognitive factors in new venture creation (e.g., research on the
DEMO in entrepreneurship of self-regulatory and metacognitive mechanisms; research on the
cognitive DEMO foundations of entrepreneurial alertness). Copyright © 2007 Strategic Manage-

‘We are born to action . .  .’ (Charles Horton
Cooley, 1902)
While these words may not apply to everyone,
they DEMO do ring true in the case of entrepre-
neurs. If they are nothing else, entrepreneurs are
persons who take action—they engage in vigorous,
persistent efforts to convert their ideas and visions
into proﬁtable, operating companies. This proclivity
for action is, in a sense, crucial to the DEMO
process; in the absence of action by individual entre-
preneurs, there would simply be no entrepreneurship
and no new ventures. As Shane, Locke, and Collins

(2003: 259) put it, ‘Entrepreneurship involves
human agency. The entrepreneurial DEMO occurs
because people act to pursue opportunities  .  .  .’ DEMO
short, entrepreneurship happens because entrepre-
neurs conceive of new products or DEMO and then
develop them through the launch and operation of
new ventures. In this sense, entrepreneurs truly are
the active element in new venture creation.
If entrepreneurs are indeed an essential part of the
process through DEMO new ventures are created, it
is reasonable to suggest that at DEMO some aspects of
their behavior and cognition play an important role in
this process. But which aspects of their behavior and
cognition are most DEMO and hence most deserving
of careful attention? The answer offered here DEMO
reﬂects a perspective taken in several other branches
of management (e.g., Human Resource Management,
Organizational Behavior). In essence, it suggests that
we should focus on those aspects of entrepreneurs’
behavior and thought that DEMO most closely linked to

the activities they perform (e.g., Landy and DEMO,
2006; Riggio, 2003). In other words, behavioral and
DEMO variables and/or processes are of interest
to entrepreneurship researchers only to the extent
that they are closely related to activities involved in
the DEMO, launch, development, and operation
of new ventures (e.g., Shane, 2003).
This basic point serves as a guiding principle
throughout this DEMO, which proceeds as follows.
First, an initial section brieﬂy describes key tasks
and activities performed by entrepreneurs, tasks
and activities to which behavioral and cognitive
variables are relevant. Second, current knowledge
concerning behavioral and cognitive variables that
have been found to play a role in these tasks DEMO
activities is reviewed. Third, the potential effects of
a variable that DEMO strongly inﬂuence many of these
tasks and activities but has not yet been systemati-
cally investigated in the context of new venture cre-
ation—affect—are DEMO A concluding section
proposes possible directions for future research.
KEY ACTIVITIES IN NEW VENTURE
CREATION
Robert Bresson (1975), a well-known French ﬁlm
director, once described the creative process in
these words: ‘Make visible what, without you, might
perhaps never have been seen.’ Those words seem
applicable to entrepreneurship and to new venture
creation which does, indeed, bring DEMO existence
something that might, without an entrepreneur,
never have existed. DEMO competing view is that spe-
ciﬁc entrepreneurs are relatively unimportant; good
DEMO will be recognized and put to use by someone,
so individuals themselves matter very little. While
this may be accurate up to a DEMO, it does not explain
situations in which extremely valuable ideas exist DEMO
a given culture, sometimes for many years, but are
not implemented. For instance, the Inca civilization,
although highly advanced in many respects, never
used the wheel for transportation. The idea of doing
so deﬁnitely existed in the culture because children
played with toys in the form DEMO wheeled carts. Yet
no one ever put this idea to use in the way in which
it was applied in many other cultures. Could DEMO
situation have changed if an appropriate entrepre-
neur were present? Since DEMO wheel was not cultur-
ally prohibited, it seems quite possible. Instances
DEMO as this suggest that individual entrepreneurs
do indeed matter, and do DEMO an important role in
Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society
‘making visible what might (without them) have
never been.’
But given that entrepreneurs DEMO an important
role in new venture creation, just what is it DEMO they
do? What is their speciﬁc role in the overall process?DEMO
Answering this question is complex because entre-
preneurs, unlike persons in DEMO other occupations
or jobs, do not have clearly deﬁned sets of DEMO,
activities, and responsibilities. Recent models of the
entrepreneurial process, however, provide frame-
works for identifying several of the tasks that are
truly central (e.g., Ardichvili, Cardozo, and Ray,
2003; Baron, DEMO; Shane, 2003). Together, these
frameworks suggest that although entrepreneurs
DEMO in many different tasks, the following are,
perhaps, among the most essential: (1) generating
ideas for new products or services, (2) recogniz-
ing business opportunities related to these ideas, (3)
obtaining the resources needed for developing these
ideas through the launch of DEMO new venture. These
are certainly not the only activities performed by
entrepreneurs (e.g., they also focus on making deci-
sions and formulating appropriate DEMO strate-
gies), but these activities are among the ones most
fundamental to early phases of new venture creation.
Behavioral and cognitive variables continue DEMO play
an important role in later phases of new venture
founding and operation (e.g., Greenberg and Baron,
2008), but the present DEMO concentrates pri-
marily on the role of these factors during the initial,
early phases of this process.
THE EFFECTS OF BEHAVIORAL
AND COGNITIVE DEMO ON KEY
ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES
What speciﬁc competencies (skills, abilities, etc.)DEMO
do entrepreneurs need to successfully create new
ventures? A basic answer DEMO this question is:
‘Many  .  .  .  and these change in relative importance
and scope across various phases of the new DEMO
creation process.’ Thus, the review that follows is
not in any DEMO exhaustive; rather it focuses primar-
ily on those cognitive and behavioral DEMO for
which strong and consistent evidence for signiﬁcant
impact on key entrepreneurial activities currently
exists. Paralleling the models of entrepreneurship
cited earlier (e.g., DEMO, 2003), discussion moves
from behavioral and cognitive factors that inﬂuence
DEMO generation of ideas and recognition of opportuni-
ties to behavioral and cognitive factors that inﬂuence

the acquisition of resources needed DEMO exploit these
opportunities.
Generating new ideas
Many deﬁnitions of creativity exist, DEMO most agree
that it involves the development of (1) something
new, that did not exist (at least in its present form)
DEMO, and (2) something that is not merely new but
also DEMO or useful. The U.S. Patent Ofﬁce
applies these criteria to patent applications: not only
must an idea be new (an advance on existing DEMO
in legal terms), it must be potentially useful too. In
addition, it must also be nonobvious—something
that is not immediately apparent to anyone who is
familiar with existing, related products (known, in
legal terminology, as prior art). Creativity, in its
strongest forms, is easy to recognize: Einstein, da
Vinci, Edison, Shakespeare—the ideas, theories, DEMO
products they offered to the world were certainly
new and, in DEMO ways, useful. But identifying
the cognitive foundations of creativity is a DEMO
more complex and difﬁcult task. Where do such
ideas originate? How DEMO they take form in the minds
of particular individuals? Revealing answers DEMO these
questions have been provided by basic research on
creativity in the ﬁelds of cognitive science and cog-
nitive psychology, and these ﬁndings serve as the
main foundation of the present discussion.
The key role of DEMO
As a result of continuing experience with the world,
all individuals enter a vast amount of information
in long term memory. Basic research DEMO that
such information is not stored randomly; rather,
it is DEMO into various cognitive structures or
frameworks. Among these, concepts are especially
DEMO to creativity and the emergence of new
ideas. Concepts are categories for objects or events
that are somewhat similar. For instance, the words
airplane, automobile, elevator, and motor scooter all
relate to equipment for moving people and objects
from one place to another: all are included in the
concept for vehicle. Similarly, while the ﬁelds of
physics, geology, biology, and chemistry differ in
many ways, they are all included DEMO the concept
science.
Concepts offer important beneﬁts with respect to
creativity: DEMO permit ready access to vast amounts
of previously stored information that can facilitate
processing such information in various ways. On the
other hand, they can act as a kind of ‘mental rut,’
Copyright © 2007 DEMO Management Society
preventing individuals from relating information
across different concepts. For instance, in the mid
1970s, engineers and scientists at Sony Corpora-
tion DEMO given the task of developing music CDs.
Initially, they produced CDs DEMO could store up to
18 hours of music—a capacity deemed too long for
the market at that time by top executives at Sony.
Why DEMO they do this? Being familiar with existing
technology, they made the early CDs 12 inches in
diameter—the same as existing LP records! In DEMO
sense, they were trapped by their own concept of a
‘music DEMO device,’ and did not realize that CDs
could be any size that was convenient.
Generating ideas through the expansion and
combination of concepts
DEMO the powerful constraining effects of existing
concepts, how can individuals ever DEMO through
them to create something truly new? Cognitive
research provides the DEMO answer (e.g., Ward,
2004): this can be accomplished by stretching or
expanding concepts in several ways. For instance,
concepts can DEMO combined, with the result that
something both new and useful is DEMO For
instance when the concepts of ‘telephone’ and
‘camera’ were combined, DEMO idea for cell phones
with built-in cameras emerged. Second, concepts
can DEMO expanded. For instance, the concept ‘service
station’ or ‘gas station’ used DEMO mean just that: a place
where fuel could be purchased and DEMO routine
service performed on automobiles and trucks. Now,
however, it DEMO been expanded into places in which a
wide array of other products, from food to clothing,
can be obtained. Concepts can also be expanded by
analogy—by perceiving similarities between objects
or events that are otherwise DEMO For instance,
when one scientist observed how plant seeds and
burrs clung to his clothing with tiny hooks, he rea-
soned that this system would also work in other
contexts—and Velcro was born.
In short, creativity appears to stem from the oper-
ation of basic cognitive processes. DEMO
these processes, in turn, offers important insights
into the question: DEMO do ideas for new products
and services originate?’ The answer, DEMO appears, is:
‘From basic cognitive processes that allow individu-
als DEMO operate on, and use, information in new ways.’
Certainly, concepts DEMO related cognitive processes
are not the only ones that are important in gen-
erating new ideas and encouraging creativity. But
a large body of DEMO suggests that these cog-
nitive frameworks, and processes related to them,DEMO

are indeed of key importance (e.g., Cianciola DEMO al.,
2006; Sternberg, 2004).
Recognizing opportunities
Ideas for new products or services are, in a sense,
the raw material for entrepreneurship, for it is often
from these ideas that concrete business opportuni-
ties emerge. Before proceeding to examine the role
of behavioral and cognitive DEMO in this process,
however, it is important to note that DEMO has been
continuing discussion in the ﬁeld of entrepreneur-
ship concerning the question of whether opportuni-
ties are recognized (they exist in the external world
and are somehow identiﬁed by speciﬁc persons), or
are instead DEMO (they emerge in the minds of spe-
ciﬁc individuals who generate DEMO from their own
cognitive resources and knowledge; e,g., Alvarez
and Barney, 2005). The present author believes that
both approaches are valid and are in no way incom-
patible, but given the focus of the present paper, the
discussion of opportunities will focus primarily on
factors inﬂuencing the identiﬁcation of such oppor-
tunities rather than on their creation.
DEMO the speciﬁc origins of opportunities,
they are often the starting point for overt entrepre-
neurial action—for efforts by entrepreneurs to create
new ventures DEMO will exploit these opportunities.
Indeed, the decision to proceed with such DEMO
often stems from entrepreneurs’ beliefs that they
have identiﬁed an opportunity no one else has yet
recognized, and can beneﬁt from being ﬁrst to bring
it to the marketplace (Durand and Coeruderoy, 2001).
Because DEMO recognition is indeed often the
start of the entrepreneurial process, it DEMO not at all
surprising that it has long been a central concept
in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. Until recently,
however, little effort was made to examine it as a
process. Rather, opportunities were deﬁned largely
in terms of economic outcomes: only ideas for a new
product, DEMO, raw material, market, or production
process that could be successfully DEMO so as to
generate economic beneﬁts for stakeholders were
viewed as constituting bona ﬁde opportunities. This
approach, though valuable in several respects, over-
DEMO several key questions.
First, it largely ignores the question of how DEMO
tunity recognition occurs; in other words, how do
speciﬁc persons actually identify opportunities that
have been generated by changes in economic, tech-
nological, and social conditions? Clearly, this is
an active process involving human cognition, and
Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society
understanding how it occurs might well suggest
ways of enhancing its occurrence—techniques for
helping current or DEMO entrepreneurs identify
opportunities that will beneﬁt not only them, but
large DEMO of persons who ultimately use the
new products or services they develop. Second, and
closely related, it does not directly address the ques-
DEMO of why some persons but not others recognize
speciﬁc opportunities. Often, DEMO are there
for anyone to notice; yet, thousands or even millions
of persons do not notice them. Why? And carrying
this a little further, how do individuals conclude that
an opportunity they have noticed is one they, rather
than others, can actually develop? This, too, appears
to be an important aspect of the process (McMullen
and Shepherd, 2006).
If we can understand why certain people
recognize opportunities that others don’t identify,
this can provide key insights into how this DEMO
takes place and how it can be enhanced. Research
on this issue suggests that an important part of
the answer involves the central role DEMO informa-
tion. Speciﬁcally, it appears that some people are
more likely DEMO others to recognize opportunities
for a variety of reasons including better access to
information and superior ability to utilize available
information effectively. Since the DEMO pointing
to these conclusions has been reviewed in detail
elsewhere, it DEMO not be described here (e.g., Shane,
2003). Rather, DEMO will be focused on a process
that may provide the basic cognitive foundations
for opportunity recognition—pattern recognition
(Matlin, 2004).
Before turning to DEMO topic, however, it should
also be noted that access to and effective utilization
of information are not the only behavioral and cog-
nitive DEMO that have been found to play a role in
opportunity recognition. In addition, four others have
received major attention: (1) engaging in DEMO active
search for opportunities, (2) alertness to opportu-
nities (the capacity to recognize them when they
emerge), (3) prior knowledge DEMO a market, industry,
or customers as a basis for recognizing DEMO oppor-
tunities in these areas, and (4) the extent, breadth,
and quality of entrepreneurs’ social networks—their
connections with others. Past research DEMO that
all of these factors are important. (e.g., Fiet, Clouse,DEMO
and Norton, 2004; Gilad, Kaish and Ronen, 1989;
Hills and Shrader, 1998; Ozgen and Baron, 2007).
Since work, DEMO, has been fully reviewed elsewhere
(e.g., Zacharakis and Spinelli, 2007), it will not be
considered in detail.

The role of pattern recognition
DEMO in the potential role of pattern recogni-
tion in opportunity identiﬁcation derives primarily
from interest in the following, key question: What
is the DEMO nature of opportunity recognition?
In other words, how does opportunity DEMO
actually occur in the minds of speciﬁc persons?
Theories and research ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of
cognitive science may be very useful in DEMO with
this basic issue. In particular, one cognitive process
long investigated DEMO cognitive scientists—pattern rec-
ognition—appears to be closely related to opportunity
recognition in the domain of entrepreneurship (Baron,
2006b). This process involves noticing meaningful pat-
terns in complex events, trends, or changes. In essence,DEMO
it includes (1) recognizing links between trends,
changes, and DEMO that appear, at ﬁrst glance, to be
unconnected, and (2) noticing that these connections
form an identiﬁable pattern. Both of these steps, in
turn, are strongly inﬂuenced by the cognitive frame-
works individuals DEMO they have
developed on the basis of past experience (e.g.,
DEMO prototypes). The clearer and more fully-
developed these frameworks, the DEMO likely are
individuals who possess them to recognize opportu-
nities in a speciﬁc domain, because these cognitive
frameworks serve as templates or guides, DEMO
these persons notice links between diverse events or
trends.
A concrete example of this process is provided by
Chester Carlson, the individual most often credited
with developing the modern copy machine. Efforts
to produce technology that DEMO produce clear
copies on regular paper had continued for decades,
so a key question is ‘Why was Carlson able to solve
this problem—one DEMO had bafﬂed many other sci-
entists and engineers?’ One possibility involves the
fact that Carlson held both a law degree and a techni-
DEMO degree. As a result, he possessed well-developed
cognitive frameworks for interpreting DEMO
relating both to the needs of potential customers
(e.g., the need for clear copies of legal documents)
and several of the technical DEMO that might be
used to meet this need. In short, Carlson, possessed
the cognitive frameworks necessary for perceiving
connections between seemingly independent events
DEMO trends (advances in several aspects of technol-
ogy, changes in the needs of many businesses, etc.)
and for detecting an emergent pattern in these con-
nections—a pattern suggestive of the opportunity he
then pursued.

Research ﬁndings provide additional evidence
for the role of pattern recognition in the identiﬁca-
tion of new business opportunities. DEMO instance,
Baron and Ensley (2006) found that the cognitive
frameworks for ‘business opportunity’ possessed
by highly experienced repeat entrepreneurs were
signiﬁcantly richer DEMO clearer (e.g., more focused)
than those of novice entrepreneurs. Further, the cog-
nitive frameworks (prototypes) of the two groups
were found to differ in several respects, and these
differences, too, are consistent with a pattern rec-
ognition perspective. Speciﬁcally, the prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs emphasized factors that
have been found to inﬂuence the success of new DEMO
tures (e.g., cash ﬂow, meeting customers’ needs).
In contrast, those of novice entrepreneurs tended
to emphasize newness or novelty. These ﬁndings
DEMO that opportunity recognition may indeed be
closely linked to pattern recognition, DEMO proto-
types, like other cognitive frameworks, are useful
in perceiving identiﬁable patterns in large arrays of
information.
A pattern recognition perspective also sheds
DEMO on another important question raised earlier:
Why do some persons but not others recognize
speciﬁc opportunities? A pattern recognition per-
spective suggests that the answer to this key ques-
tion involves, at least in part, the fact that indi-
viduals, because of contrasting life experiences,
DEMO greatly in terms of the cognitive frameworks
they possess. To the extent they possess frame-
works useful in ‘connecting the dots’ between
seemingly unrelated DEMO or trends, they are,
in a sense, cognitively equipped to recognize
emergent patterns—and hence, in some cases, new
business opportunities. Pattern DEMO may
also play a role in entrepreneurial alertness. Spe-
ciﬁc persons may be more or less ‘alert’ to various
opportunities because they possess cognitive DEMO
works (cognitive equipment) that permit them to
notice emerging opportunities even when they are
not actively searching for them. These frameworks
serve as DEMO that assist such persons in rec-
ognizing emergent patterns and the opportunities
related to them.
Almost certainly, pattern recognition is not the
only cognitive process involved in opportunity rec-
ognition. However, attention to this and other basic
cognitive processes may offer important insights
into key aspects of this DEMO process and
may, for this reason, be worthy of further careful
investigation.

Acquiring essential resources
Another important pre-launch activity for DEMO
neurs is acquiring essential resources—ﬁnancial,
human, and informational. These resources DEMO the
assets necessary to convert ideas and strategies into
actual operating businesses, so entrepreneurs devote
a considerable portion of their time and energy to
securing them. Clearly, not all entrepreneurs are
equally successful in obtaining such resources, and
differences in their proﬁciency with respect to these
tasks can have powerful implications for their new
ventures. Indeed, a lack of sufﬁcient resources is one
of the major reasons why so many new ventures DEMO
(Bygrave and Zacharakis, 2007).
This basic fact raises an important and complex
question: Why are some entrepreneurs so much more
successful than others in obtaining the resources
they need? While many variables have been found
to play a role (Shane, 2003), two that involve DEMO
ioral and cognitive factors are entrepreneurs’ social
skills—their ability to interact with others in an
effective manner (e.g., Baron and Markman, 2000),DEMO
and entrepreneurs’ social networks—the networks
of personal relationships they develop with others,
and which often help them to acquire the resources
they need (e.g., Aldrich, 1999).
The role of social skills in resource DEMO
A large body of research ﬁndings in several ﬁelds
(e.g., organizational behavior, human resource
management) indicates that social skills—a variety
of proﬁciencies DEMO help individuals to interact
effectively with others—exert strong effects on
outcomes individuals experience in many contexts
(e.g., Riggio and Throckmorton, 1988; Ferris, Witt
and Hochwarter, 2001). Speciﬁc social skills that
have been found to exert signiﬁcant effects in this
respect include social perception (the ability to
perceive others accurately), impression manage-
ment (skill in making favorable ﬁrst impressions
on others), expressiveness (the ability to express
emotions clearly and openly) and social adaptabil-
ity (proﬁciency in adapting one’s actions DEMO current
social contexts; e.g., Ferris et al., 2001; Wayne
et al., 1997).
In work settings, social skills have been found DEMO
inﬂuence a wide range of important organizational
processes. To mention just a few of these ﬁndings,
persons high in social skills, as compared to persons
low in such skills, are more successful as job can-
didates (e.g., Riggio and Throckmorton, 1988),
Copyright © 2007 DEMO Management Society
tend to receive higher performance reviews from
supervisors (e.g., Robbins and DeNisi, 1994), attain
faster promotions, and receive higher DEMO (e.g.,
Belliveau, O’Reilly, and Wade, 1995). Similarly,
individuals high in social skills generally achieve
greater success than persons low DEMO such skills in
many occupations (e.g., medicine, law, sales; DEMO,
Wayne et al., 1997), achieve better results in negotia-
DEMO (e.g., Lewicki et al., 2003), and often (although
not always) attain higher levels of task or job perfor-
mance (e.g., , Hochwarter et al., 2006, 2007).
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that indi-
viduals high in social skills are able to interact
DEMO others more effectively than persons low in
social skills across a wide range of settings and
contexts This ability, in turn, may often DEMO
ute to entrepreneurs’ success in securing essential
resources—both ﬁnancial and human. For instance,
strong social skills help entrepreneurs to build broad
and informative DEMO networks (e.g., Diener and
Seligman, 2002). Such networks, in turn, are often
an important source of many kinds of valuable
resources (e.g., Nahapiet and Ghosal, 1998). Simi-
larly, several social DEMO (e.g., social perception,
expressiveness, impression management) have been
found to play a role in persuasion, and effectiveness
in inﬂuencing others—venture capitalists, potential
customers, prospective employees—is a valuable
ability for entrepreneurs in many DEMO contexts
(e.g., Baron and Markman, 2000).
While the potential DEMO of social skills in entre-
preneurship has been recognized for several years
(e.g., Baron and Markman, 2000), relatively
little empirical data on this issue currently exist.
However, the few studies that have been performed
to investigate this question suggest (e.g., Baron
and Markman, 2003; DEMO and Tang, 2007) that
social skills are related to the success of new ven-
tures: the higher entrepreneurs are in such skills, DEMO
greater the ﬁnancial success attained by their busi-
nesses. In addition, DEMO more directly relevant to the
present discussion, the impact of social DEMO on new
venture performance is mediated by entrepreneurs’
effectiveness in acquiring useful information and
in securing required human and ﬁnancial resources
Speciﬁcally, the higher entrepreneurs are in terms of
several social skills (e.g., social perception, expres-
siveness, impression management), the more effec-
tive they are in obtaining essential resources (both
ﬁnancial and human; Baron and Tang, 2007). As
shown by previous research (e.g., Shane, 2003),
DEMO more adept entrepreneurs are in obtaining such

resources, the better the ﬁnancial performance of
their new ventures.
In sum, it appears that entrepreneurs who possess
well-developed social skills gain important advan-
tages over others who are DEMO on these skills–
advantages that contribute measurably to the success
of their new ventures. To the extent this is so, it seems
useful to take such skills carefully into account in
efforts to acquire full and DEMO understanding of
the process of new venture creation.
Social networks, social DEMO,
and acquiring resources
As noted previously, Another important behavioral
component DEMO the new venture process is entrepre-
neurs’ social networks—the number and quality of
their social ties to others. To some extent, these
networks are a reﬂection of entrepreneurs’ social
skills. Research ﬁndings indicate that persons high
DEMO social skills generally have broader and higher-
quality social networks than persons low in such
skills (e.g., Diener and Seligman, 2002). But social
skills are not the only factor that inﬂuences entre-
preneurs’ social DEMO Entrepreneurs’ social
networks are also strongly affected by their social
capital, DEMO is often deﬁned either as (1) the ability
of individuals to extract beneﬁts from their social
structures, networks, and memberships, or (DEMO) these
beneﬁts themselves—the advantages individuals
gain from their relationships with others (Nahapiet
and Ghoshal, 1998).
Social capital itself derives from being known to
others (either directly or indirectly through other
contacts), having a good reputation, and being in
established, continuing relationships with them.
These DEMO provide individuals with access to a wide
range of both tangible and intangible resources.
Included among the tangible beneﬁts provided by
social ties are DEMO resources and enhanced
access to potentially valuable information. Included
among less tangible beneﬁts are support, advice, and
encouragement from others, as well as increased
cooperation and trust from them. While the beneﬁts
provided by these DEMO resources are less readily
measured in economic terms, they are still DEMO
highly valuable to those who obtain them. Thus,
social capital is deﬁnitely worth possessing: it is
an asset that often yields beneﬁcial outcomes to the
persons who possess them.
Research ﬁndings (e.g., Ozgen and DEMO, 2007)
indicate that entrepreneurs often use their social net-
works DEMO a source of information that contributes to
Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society
recognizing opportunities and acquiring resources.
Moreover, in this regard, they DEMO information
provided not only by personal contacts (informal
social networks), DEMO also information gained in pro-
fessional forums (conventions, meetings), and from
mentors—more experienced individuals who share
their knowledge and wisdom with them. DEMO,
the use of such information by entrepreneurs is
closely related to the cognitive frameworks they
have acquired through experience (e.g., schemas),
such that the better developed these frameworks,
the more the entrepreneurs DEMO from network-
provided information. This suggests close and con-
tinuous interactions between cognitive variables and
ones relating to social networks.
A large body of DEMO evidence indicates that
both social networks and social capital play impor-
tant roles in the creation of new ventures and in the
success of DEMO businesses once they are launched.
Thus, understanding the behavioral and cogni-
DEMO foundations of these variables may be useful
in terms of enhancing the breadth and accuracy
of current models of the entrepreneurial process.
Overall, existing evidence suggests that entrepre-

be worthy of careful research attention.
THE ROLE OF AFFECT IN NEW
VENTURE CREATION
So far, this discussion has focused primarily on
behavioral and cognitive factors—overt actions by
entrepreneurs and various aspects of their cognitive
processes. DEMO, an extensive body of literature
in many ﬁelds—several branches of management
DEMO well as in cognitive science and social psychol-
ogy—suggests that another factor, too, should be
carefully considered. This factor is affect, and refers
to relatively temporary and mild moods or feelings
individuals experience throughout their DEMO lives
(event-induced or state affect) as well as to more
stable tendencies to experience positive or nega-
tive feelings (dispositional affect; Baron, in press;
Forgas, 2000). Although event-induced and disposi-
tional affect stem from different sources, they have
been found to exert similar and parallel effects in
many situations; thus, in this discussion, the terms

positive affect and negative affect will be used DEMO
refer to such feelings regardless of whether they are
generated by speciﬁc events or by stable, underly-
ing propensities toward such reactions. Both event-
induced and dispositional affect are distinguished,
however, from emotions, which DEMO complex
patterns of subjective cognitive states, physiologi-
cal reactions, and expressive behaviors (e.g., Zajonc
and McIntosh, 1992)—reactions commonly labeled
with such terms of joy, sorrow, and anger. Emotions
tend to be more DEMO, longer lasting, and more
general in scope than affective reactions (DEMO, they
involve strong physiological responses as well as
subjective cognitive states; Plutchik, 2002). Despite
their relatively mild intensity and short-lived exis-
tence, however, even relatively small shifts in
affect—small and temporary ﬂuctuations in DEMO
moods and feelings—have been found to exert pow-
erful effects on both behavior and cognition (e.g.,
Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener, 2005)DEMO In view of
this evidence, it seems reasonable to suggest that
DEMO may also play an important role in new venture
creation. Several lines of reasoning offer support for
this proposal.
First, as noted earlier, DEMO environments in which
entrepreneurs typically operate are often somewhat
chaotic—unpredictable and ﬁlled with rapid change.
Events that are unexpected often induce stronger
affective reactions DEMO ones that are merely routine
(e.g., Forgas, 2000). Thus, entrepreneurs—by virtue
of the environments they confront—may be espe-
cially likely to DEMO frequent and relatively
intense changes in current affect (i.e., mood or feel-
ings). Research ﬁndings offer indirect support for
these informal observations. DEMO example, several
studies indicate that passion—entrepreneurs’ pow-
erful commitment to their DEMO ventures, a factor
that might predispose them to experience rapid and
DEMO changes in affect—plays an important role in
the success of these companies (e.g., Baum, Locke,
and Smith, 2001; Baum and Locke, 2004).
Despite these ﬁndings and logical grounds for
anticipating that entrepreneurs tend to experience
frequent and relatively intense shifts in affect, there
have been relatively few attempts to systematically
examine the potential role of affect DEMO the entre-
preneurial process. This is somewhat surprising for
several reasons. First, the importance of affect has
been increasingly recognized in other branches of
management. Research in organizational behavior
and human resource management, for example, DEMO
cates that affect plays an important role in key organi-

zational processes (e.g., Forgas, 1998, 2000; Weiss,
2002) such as employment interviews (e.g., Burger
and Caldwell, 2000) and performance appraisals
(Cropanzano and Wright, 1999). Speciﬁcally, inter-
viewers and managers typically assign higher ratings
to the persons they DEMO when they (i.e., the
raters) are experiencing positive affect than DEMO
they are experiencing negative affect. Further, affect
has also been found DEMO inﬂuence the performance of
many work-related tasks, with persons experiencing
positive DEMO often showing higher performance
than those experiencing negative affect (e.g., Staw
and Barsade, 1993).
Other ﬁndings suggest that individuals’ current
moods or feelings also inﬂuence a wide range of
behaviors, both in work settings and other contexts
(e.g., Baron, Branscombe, and Byrne, in press).
For instance, affect has been found to strongly
inﬂuence willingness to help others (prosocial
behavior and organizational citizenship behavior;
e.g., Podsakoff DEMO MacKenzie, 1997), aggression
(including aggression occurring in work settings;
e.g., Grifﬁn and O’Leary-Kelly, 2004), and coopera-
tion among work DEMO members (e.g., Beersma et
al., 2003). Since high levels DEMO cooperation and trust
among co-founders of new ventures are often impor-
tant for the success of these ventures (e.g., Chandler,
2007), DEMO direct effects of affect on behavior are
relevant to new venture creation.
It is important to note, however, that while a large
body DEMO existing literature indicates that affect can
inﬂuence important processes occurring in organi-
zational contexts, most of this research has been
conducted in large, DEMO companies rather than
new ventures. This fact raises the following ques-
tion: Is affect also relevant to events and processes
occurring in new ventures? One reason for sug-
gesting that it is involves, once again, the fact that
the environments in which entrepreneurs function
are often ones DEMO change rapidly and are replete
with unpredictable events and outcomes (e.g.,DEMO
Lichtenstein, Dooley, and Lumpkin, 2006).
Research on the inﬂuence DEMO affect suggests that it
is most likely to exert powerful effects on cogni-
tion and overt behavior in situations of precisely
this type—ones in DEMO individuals cannot follow
well-rehearsed ‘scripts’ or clearly established rules
concerning behavioral options. In such situations,
affect can readily tip the balance toward speciﬁc
DEMO or decisions—effects it might not produce
in environments that are more certain and predict-
able (e.g., Forgas, 2000). In sum, because DEMO the

environments in which they operate, entrepreneurs
may be especially likely to experience rapid and
intense shifts in DEMO Moreover, the unpredictable,
‘unscripted’ environments they confront are ones in
DEMO shifts in affect are likely to produce especially
strong effects. The potential nature of such effects,
and their relevance to the process of DEMO venture
creation, are now considered.
Speciﬁc inﬂuences of affect on the
DEMO process
Given the very broad and pervasive inﬂuence of
affect across a wide range of contexts, it seems rea-
sonable to suggest that it may also play an important
role in new venture creation. Consistent with DEMO
ous ﬁndings concerning the inﬂuence of affect, such
effects may vary DEMO in nature, being positive in
some respects but negative in others (e.g., Baron,
2008).
Potentially beneﬁ cial effects of affect
Examination of pertinent literature (e.g.,
Lyubomirsky et al., 2005) suggests that affect may
exert several beneﬁcial effects on new venture cre-
ation. First, consider idea generation and opportunity
recognition. Research ﬁndings indicate that in many
DEMO, high levels of positive affect (either event-
induced or disposition) DEMO cognitive ﬂex-
ibility and creativity (e.g., Staw, Sutton, and Pelled,
1994). More speciﬁcally, positive affect enhances
individuals’ ability to think in original and creative
ways. Such thinking can, of course, facilitate DEMO
generation. Moreover, there is growing evidence
that such thinking plays an DEMO role in oppor-
tunity recognition. For instance Ward (2004) sug-
gests that new products or services often derive from
the expansion or combination DEMO existing concepts.
Similarly, as noted earlier, the process of pattern rec-
ognition may play an important role in the process of
recognizing new DEMO opportunities (e.g., Baron,
2006a, b). Recognizing such patterns, in turn, often
involves thinking ﬂexibly and the kind of expansion
or combination of concepts described earlier (Ward,
2004). Thus, to DEMO extent positive affect enhances
such modes of thought, it may facilitate DEMO idea
generation and opportunity recognition.
Another potentially beneﬁcial inﬂuence of affect
on new venture creation involves the task of acquir-
ing essential ﬁnancial and DEMO resources. Affect
(and especially positive affect) can have impor-
tant beneﬁcial effects with respect to this task.

DEMO, marketing experts generally agree,
‘Sells.’ To the extent entrepreneurs are DEMO
tic—which implies experiencing and expressing
positive affect—they are also likely to be persuasive.
Moreover, growing evidence suggests that affective
reactions are contagious—they tend to spread from
one individual to another (e.g., Hatﬁeld, Cacioppo,
and Rapson, 1994). Thus, entrepreneurs who are
enthusiastic and positive about DEMO ideas and new
ventures tend to be highly persuasive when making
presentations to potential investors, customers, or
employees. In this respect, strong positive affective
reactions can be beneﬁcial.
A third way in which affect can DEMO a beneﬁ -
cial role in entrepreneurship involves the process of
decision making–a process not examined in detail
in this discussion, but one that certainly plays a
key role throughout the new venture creation. Often,
DEMO must perform this task under condi-
tions of uncertainty and high time pressure. Affect
may be directly relevant to decision making because
it strongly DEMO the decision-making strategies
individuals adopt. High levels of positive affect seem
to tip the balance towards satisﬁcing, a strategy in
which the ﬁrst acceptable alternative is chosen. This
permits persons using this strategy to make decisions
DEMO quickly and efﬁciently. In contrast, negative
affect seems to tip the DEMO toward maximiz-
ing—a strategy involving exhaustive examination of
all available alternatives in order to choose the best.
While maximizing often yields superior choices
(e.g., Iyengar, Wells, and Schwartzl, 2006), it is an
approach DEMO decisions that may not be practical for
entrepreneurs, who must often DEMO decisions under
stringent time constraints. Thus, overall, satisﬁcing
may be a more useful strategy for entrepreneurs to
follow (although, as noted below, this is certainly
not always true). Positive affect may also encour-
DEMO entrepreneurs to adopt other efﬁcient strategies
for decision-making in which, for DEMO, they do
not review information they have already considered
and largely DEMO information that is unimportant or
irrelevant (Isen and Means, 1983). Finally, individu-
als experiencing positive affect often show greater
ﬂexibility in their approach to solving various prob-
lems and in their thinking generally (Frederickson,
2001).
In addition to these positive effects, all produced
through the impact of affective states on cognition,
affect can also inﬂuence DEMO aspects of entre-
preneurs’ behavior. For instance, positive affect
has been DEMO to encourage helpful, cooperative
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 1: 167–182 (2007)
DOI: 10.1002/sej
176
R. A. Baron
actions—behaviors useful to entrepreneurs in estab-
lishing good DEMO with co-founders, employees,
venture capitalists, potential customers, and others.
DEMO contrast, negative affect reduces such reactions
and may, in fact, DEMO anger, intransigence,
and overt aggression—reactions that can interfere
with entrepreneurs’ DEMO to establish broad and
helpful social networks. Thus, affect can inﬂuence
DEMO aspects of new venture creation through its rela-
tively direct effects on entrepreneurs’ behavior as
well as through its effects on cognitive processes.
Potentially DEMO effects of affect
Offsetting these potentially beneﬁcial effects are
others in which affect may exert a negative impact
on new venture creation. First, it has often been sug-
gested that entrepreneurs—especially novice entre-
preneurs—tend to ‘fall DEMO love’ with their own ideas
for new products or services (e.g., Baron and Ensley,
2006). In other words, they have such strong positive
feelings concerning these ideas, that they lose the
capacity to evaluate them carefully. These informal
observations suggest that affective reactions—espe-
cially when DEMO are intense—can have detrimental
effects both on opportunity recognition and on the
preliminary feasibility analysis that often follows
such recognition (e.g., Ardichvili, Cardozo, and
Ray, 2003). Speciﬁcally, strong affective reactions
can lead entrepreneurs to prematurely accept, or
prematurely reject, potential business opportunities.
Positive affect DEMO lead to premature acceptance
because entrepreneurs, using their own affective
states DEMO a source of information, conclude that if
they react positively to DEMO identiﬁed opportunity,
‘it must be very good.’ This may result in a prema-
ture closure of the search for suitable opportunities
(‘Why look further when something so outstanding
has already been identiﬁed?’). Since DEMO search
has been found to be an important component of
successful opportunity recognition (e.g., Fiet et al.,
2004), this can have DEMO implications for entre-
preneurs and their new ventures.
Conversely, strong negative DEMO in response to
potential business opportunities may lead entrepre-
neurs to reject these opportunities prematurely, in
the absence of careful feasibility analysis. In short,
strong affective reactions to ideas for new prod-
ucts or services DEMO impede more careful and ratio-
nal processes for choosing among these potential
opportunities.
Another way in which affect can have negative
implications for entrepreneurs DEMO the entrepreneur-
Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society
ial process involves acceptance of high levels of risk.
While existing evidence concerning the question of
DEMO entrepreneurs are more or less accepting of
risk than other persons remains mixed (e.g., Miner
and Raju, 2004; Stewart and Roth, 2001), it seems
clear that acceptance of very high levels of risk
DEMO often prove detrimental to the success of new
ventures. Affect enters the picture because research
ﬁndings indicate that positive affect often increases
individuals’ willingness DEMO accept high levels of
risk (e.g., Forgas, 2000). Feeling DEMO leads indi-
viduals to also feel ‘lucky’ or relatively immune to
dangers and potential problems, and this encourages
relatively high-risk behaviors and actions. In short,
to the extent positive affect infuses entrepreneurs’
judgments and decisions, it may lead them to select
high-risk strategies or actions, with potentially dev-
astating consequences for their new ventures.
Conversely, high levels of negative affect might
have the opposite effect, directing entrepreneurs
away from even moderate levels of risk and into
‘totally safe’ paths and strategies. Negative affect
DEMO often a signal to the persons experiencing it that
something is seriously wrong or that the current situ-
ation poses considerable danger (e.g., DEMO
et al., 2005). To the extent such reactions occur,
DEMO may lead entrepreneurs to reject opportunities
that are actually quite promising—to perceive such
opportunities, in the language of signal detection
theory (e.g., McMullen and Shepherd, 2006), as
‘false alarms’ when in fact, they DEMO actually ‘hits’—
bona ﬁde opportunities worth pursuing.
A third way in which affect can have negative
implications for entrepreneurs involves its impact on
various DEMO biases. A substantial body of evi-
dence suggests that such biases are often strength-
ened, in their impact, by strong affective states. For
DEMO, high levels of positive affect have been
found to enhance the DEMO bias—a tendency to
expect positive outcomes and events (e.g., Busenitz
and Barney, 1997; Simon, Houghton, and Aquino,
2000). Further, positive affect also increases the
tendency to fall prey to the planning DEMO, an
offshoot of the optimistic bias. The planning fallacy
involves tendencies DEMO individuals to assume that
they can accomplish more than they actually can
during a speciﬁc period of time, or that they can
complete tasks sooner than is actually feasible (e.g.,
Buehler, Grifﬁn, and McDonald, 1997). When
experiencing positive affect, individuals are espe-
cially likely DEMO show such tendencies, and this can
be potentially damaging both for DEMO and
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 1: 167–182 (2007)

177
their new ventures. Overly optimistic DEMO
about how rapidly and efﬁciently various tasks can
be accomplished may lead to situations in which, for
instance, new product development or the DEMO
tion of marketing or ﬁnancial plans takes far longer
than anticipated, DEMO generating disappointment and
annoyance among investors, customers, and other
stakeholders.
Conversely, negative affect may induce other
forms of cognitive bias with different detrimental
implications. For instance, strong negative affect
may strengthen the negativity bias—a tendency to
overestimate the importance of negative informa-
tion regarding some action or DEMO (e.g., Kunda,
1999). To the extent such tendencies occur, entre-
preneurs may, again, fail to exploit viable opportuni-
ties because the powerful impact of cognitive biases
distorts their evaluations of these opportunities.
DEMO, research ﬁndings indicate that affect can
strongly inﬂuence memory. In general, individu-
als tend to remember information consistent with
their present moods or DEMO This tendency, too,
can pose a potential danger to entrepreneurs. DEMO
experiencing positive affect, entrepreneurs tend
to recall positive information offering support DEMO
speciﬁc courses of action, even if these actions are
not actually DEMO Similarly, when experiencing
negative affect, they tend to recall negative informa-
tion that may deter them from pursuing potentially
valuable courses of action. DEMO other words, affect
may bias entrepreneurs’ recall of information in
ways DEMO add error or ‘noise’ to their judgments or
decisions. These effects can play an important role
in opportunity recognition, since effective pattern
recognition (DEMO may be one important foundation
of opportunity identiﬁcation), involves processing
information previously stored in memory so as to
notice links or connections between DEMO information
(e.g., Matlin, 2004).
It should also be noted DEMO affect can negatively
impact the new venture creation process not merely
through its inﬂuence on cognitive processes, but also
through its more direct effects on a wide range of
overt behaviors, actions ranging from helpfulness
and cooperation on the one hand, through anger,
inﬂexibility, and overt DEMO on the other. Such
effects, too, are worthy of careful consideration.
Links between affect and cognition:
evidence from neuroeconomics
While a wealth DEMO research ﬁndings offer support for
the strong inﬂuence of affect on cognition, some of
Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society
the most dramatic ﬁndings in this respect have been
reported by the new ﬁeld of neuroeconomics, This
ﬁeld draws upon the research methods and theoreti-
cal frameworks of DEMO, cognitive science,
and economics, in an effort to understand the poten-
tial role of affect in decision making and other cog-
nitive DEMO closely related to economic activity
(e.g., Cohen, 2005; Willingham and Dunn, 2003). A
key ﬁnding of research in this ﬁeld is that two dis-
tinct systems for processing information exist within
the human DEMO (e.g., Cohen, 2005). One system
is concerned with what DEMO be termed ‘reason’
(or logical thought) while the other deals primarily
with affect or emotion. Growing evidence suggests
that these two systems interact DEMO complex ways
during problem solving, decision-making, and other
important cognitive processes. This interaction is
compellingly illustrated by research employing what
is known as DEMO ‘ultimatum’ paradigm (e.g., Sanfey
et al., 2003).
In this DEMO, two persons are told that they can
divide a given sum (e.g., $10) between them. One
can suggest an initial division and DEMO second can
accept or reject it. Since any division provides the
second person with positive payoffs, total rationality
suggests that this individual should accept any divi-
sion offered; doing so will result in tangible gains. In
fact, however, most people reject divisions that offer
them less than DEMO, and many reject divisions that
offer them less than $5 (half the sum to be divided
between the two players). MRI scans DEMO that
when individuals receive offers they view as unfair,
brain regions related both to reasoning (e.g., the
dorsolateral prefontal cortex) and to emotion (e.g.,
the limbic system) are activated. However—and this
is DEMO crucial ﬁnding—the greater the amount of
activity in emotion-processing regions of the brain,
the greater the likelihood that individuals will reject
the offers—act DEMO ways that are, in a sense, contrary
to their own economic interests (e.g., Sanfey et al.,
2003). These ﬁndings, and those of related research,
suggest that affect and cognition interact at DEMO
basic levels within the brain. Further, it appears
that affect can DEMO outweigh rational con-
siderations in decision making and other cognitive
processes (DEMO, Cohen, 2005). In the light of such
ﬁndings, it DEMO essential that affect be included as
a variable of interest in ongoing research concern-
ing the nature of complex processes through which
new ventures DEMO conceived, launched, and become
proﬁtable operating companies (e.g., Mitchell et al.,
2007).

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS,
AND DIRECTIONS FOR
FUTURE RESEARCH
A basic theme of this paper has been that because
entrepreneurs constitute DEMO active element in new
venture creation, knowledge concerning relevant
aspects of DEMO behavior and cognition can add
appreciably to our understanding of this complex
process. This suggestion, in itself, is far from new.
Researchers in DEMO ﬁeld of entrepreneurship have
devoted growing attention to investigating aspects
of entrepreneurs’ behavior and thought, as well as
other characteristics they possess or demonstrate
(e.g., Busenitz and Arthurs, 2006; Ling, Zhao, and
Baron, 2008; Mitchell, et al., 2007; Zhao, Seibert,
and Hills, 2005).
To date, however, many of the issues and topics
discussed in earlier sections of this paper have
received relatively little empirical DEMO For
instance, no research known to the present author
has been DEMO to examine the role of concepts
and other cognitive frameworks in the generation of
ideas for new products or services, although such
research is a logical extension of basic investigations
of creativity in cognitive science. Similarly, research
on the role of pattern recognition in the identiﬁcation
of business DEMO has only just begun (e.g.,
Baron and Ensley, 2006), and much remains to be
done in order to determine the role DEMO this basic
cognitive-perceptual process in opportunity recogni-
tion and new venture creation. Perhaps more surpris-
ingly, we do not yet have a clear understanding of
the concept of entrepreneurial alertness, despite the
fact that it is included in many theoretical frame-
works of entrepreneurship and in much ongoing
DEMO (e.g., Kirzner, 1985).
What, speciﬁcally, does such ‘alertness’ DEMO?
As noted earlier, one possibility is that it can be
DEMO in terms of the cognitive frameworks
developed by individual entrepreneurs—frameworks
for storing and processing information relating to
industries, technologies, and many other factors;DEMO
the broader these frameworks, the more useful they
may be to DEMO from the point of view of
helping them ‘connect the dots’ between seemingly
unrelated events or trends, and hence identifying
newly emerging opportunities. On the other hand,
alertness could also involve other aspects of percep-
DEMO: how broadly and efﬁciently individuals scan
the external world, where they set their criteria for
identifying ‘signal’ versus ‘noise’ (e.g., McMullen
Copyright DEMO 2007 Strategic Management Society
and Shepherd, 2006), and the speciﬁc DEMO
they use for processing various kinds of information.
Understanding the cognitive and behavioral founda-
tions of entrepreneurial alertness appears to be a
crucial task, since this concept features prominently
in many extant theories and is included DEMO much
ongoing research.
Additional avenues for future research are sug-
gested by the fact research in cognitive science has
focused increasingly on the processing DEMO information
that occurs below the level of conscious awareness
(e.g., Dijksterhuis and Nordgren, 2006)—processing
that occurs, but can’t be readily described DEMO reported
by the individuals involved. This is often termed
automatic processing, DEMO label reﬂecting the fact that
such processing, in contrast to careful, conscious
controlled processing, tends to be fast and relatively
effortless, in DEMO The term ‘intuition’ is relevant
here, for it is often used DEMO descriptions of decision
making by entrepreneurs and VCs. Researchers in
the ﬁeld of cognitive science generally deﬁne intu-
ition as a special kind of DEMO processing’—
information processing that occurs, and produces
measurable results, but that is often not open to
inspection by the persons who engage in DEMO Many
ingenious methods have been devised to investigate
such processing (e.g., Myers, 2002), but perhaps the
most revealing are those based on the methods of
neuroscience, including scans of activity in various
regions of the brain as individuals perform a wide
range of activities. Research using DEMO methods
indicates that we possess two distinct neural systems
for processing social information—one that operates
in an automatic manner and another that operates
in DEMO systematic and controlled manner. Moreover,
these two systems appear to be centered in different
regions of the brain (e.g., Cunningham et al., 2003;
Duncan and Owen, 2000).
Overall, the results of DEMO studies employing
neuroscience methodology indicate that the distinc-
tion between automatic and controlled processing is
both real and basic. Because automatic processing
(e.g., DEMO judgments and decisions by entre-
preneurs, VCs, and others) is DEMO assumed to
play a role in key aspects of new venture creation,
it may prove useful to include this distinction in
future research DEMO the cognitive foundations of new
venture creation.
Finally, as noted earlier, future research should
carefully examine the potential role of affect in key
DEMO of new venture creation. Affect has been found
to exert powerful and pervasive effects on many cog-
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 1: 167–182 (2007)

179
nitive processes and many aspects DEMO behavior across
a wide range of situations (e.g., Forgas, 2000; Weiss,
2002). Thus, examining its effects with respect to idea
generation, opportunity recognition (or creation), and
resource attainment may yield DEMO new insights
into the basic foundations of these activities. In this
respect, it seems useful to brieﬂy consider one addi-
tional point relating to the overall role of affect in
human behavior and cognition—the suggestion that
DEMO (and especially positive affect), may constitute
an important strength or DEMO for entrepreneurs.
This perspective, which has emerged very recently in
several DEMO ﬁelds (e.g., organizational behavior,
industrial/organizational psychology), fully recog-
nizes that affect can be a source of error or bias in
DEMO contexts—a factor that interferes with accuracy
and rationality in organizational processes such as
job interviews, performance appraisal, and in many
cognitive processes, such as decision-making (e.g.,
George and Brief, 1992; Weiss, 2002)DEMO However, it
also calls attention to potential beneﬁts that derive
from DEMO propensity to experience positive affect
often and in many different contexts. An extensive
body of research ﬁndings (reviewed in detail by
Lyubomirsky et al., 2005), indicate there may be
a direct causal link between experiencing positive
affect frequently and attaining successful outcomes
in many life domains—work and DEMO, personal
relationships, and even individual health. In other
words, a DEMO to experience positive affect may
contribute to, rather than be a DEMO of, favorable
life outcomes. One explanation for this relationship
(Lyubormirsky et al., 2005) is as follows: Positive
affect is interpreted by the persons who experience it
as a sign that ‘all is going well,DEMO and that current situa-
tions pose no threat or danger. As a result, people who
experience positive affect frequently are, as Lyu-
bomirsky DEMO al. (2005: 804) put it: ‘.  .  .  DEMO situ-
ated to broaden and build—to expand their resources
and friendships;  .  .  .  to build their repertoires of skills
for future use  .  .  .  or to rest and relax and DEMO rebuild
their energy  .  .  .’ In other words, the positive affect
experienced by these persons helps them to acquire
essential ingredients DEMO which success is often con-
structed—speciﬁc task-related skills, social support,
DEMO social networks, positive perceptions of
themselves and others (e.g., high DEMO and
high self-efﬁcacy), high likableness, effective means
of dealing with DEMO, and successful strategies for
resolving conﬂict with others. With these and DEMO
tools at their disposal, they go on to attain success in
DEMO domains of life.

When this framework is extended to the ﬁeld of
entrepreneurship, an intriguing possibility emerges:
perhaps the propensity to experience positive affect
often and across a wide DEMO of situations contrib-
utes to entrepreneurs’ human and social capital—the
broad range of skills, knowledge, and capacities they
bring to their new ventures, and the number and
quality of relationships they have with others both
DEMO the outside the new venture (e.g., Baron,
2005; Davidsson DEMO Honig, 2003). This possibil-
ity, in turn, appears to DEMO important implications
for the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. In particular, they
suggest DEMO the optimism, enthusiasm, passion, and
energy that are the hallmarks DEMO many entrepreneurs
(e.g., Simon et al., 2000) may provide them with
an important asset—one that assists them in per-
forming many of DEMO activities required for
launching and operating new ventures. Positive
affect can indeed yield detrimental outcomes in
some instances (e.g., it can induce entrepreneurs
DEMO prematurely terminate their active search for
opportunities and can direct them toward excessive
levels of optimism and risk; e.g., Stewart and Roth,
DEMO). At the same time, however, it also confers
many important beneﬁts, helping entrepreneurs to
expand their skills, knowledge, and social contacts
(e.g., Wright and Staw, 1999). In addition, it may
DEMO to their personal health, (e.g., Sanfey
et al., 2003); and robust good health appears
to be one essential requirement for successfully
DEMO new ventures.
This reasoning, in turn, suggests further theoreti-
cal possibilities that can readily be investigated in
future research. Speciﬁcally, it suggests that one
difference between highly successful and less suc-
cessful entrepreneurs may involve DEMO abili-
ties to regulate one’s own positive affect—to reap
the beneﬁts of such feelings while reigning them in
sufﬁciently to avoid the potential dangers DEMO pose.
In other words, highly successful entrepreneurs
may possess or develop DEMO self-regulatory
and metacognitive mechanism (e.g., Ericsson et al.,
2006)—mechanisms that help them to monitor, reg-

provide them with increased awareness of their own
cognitive DEMO and limitations (Kanfer, 1990;
Zimmerman, 2006). Together, such self-regulatory
and metacognitive skills may assist those entrepre-
neurs who acquire them DEMO effectively regulate their
own affective reactions, and hence to maximize
the DEMO of positive affect while minimizing its
potential costs. Although no direct evidence currently

exists for these suggestions, they are consistent with
an extensive body of basic research suggesting that
self-regulatory and metacognitive skills DEMO helpful
to individuals in many contexts—and especially in
adjusting to the kind of complex and rapidly chang-
ing environments entrepreneurs frequently face (e.g.,
Zimmerman, 2006).
In sum, it is suggested that entrepreneurship
researchers DEMO beneﬁt greatly from broadening
their working deﬁnition of ‘behavioral and cognitive’
factors. By doing so, they can tap into a large store of
information about such factors already acquired by
other ﬁelds and—more importantly—use this infor-
DEMO and the concepts and theories it provides
to help answer questions about key aspects of the
new venture process. Crossing boundaries between
disciplines is DEMO difﬁcult, so the effort involved
will, necessarily, be high. But DEMO rewards, too, may
be great and may contribute signiﬁcantly to overall
understanding of the complex process through
which, to paraphrase a quotation cited earlier, entre-
preneurs create or ‘make visible’ something that,
without them—the active principle in entrepreneur-
ship—might truly ‘never have been.’
