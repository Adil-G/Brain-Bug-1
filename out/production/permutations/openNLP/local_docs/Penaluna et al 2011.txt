Abstract
DEMO – This research investigates the contextual differences that exist in the development
and delivery of enterprise education in higher education globally. It sought to DEMO distinct
differences in the provision of enterprise education, and also the DEMO of opinion that
are present in enterprise educators.
Design /methodology/approach- DEMO paper approaches the issue of contextual differences
at the level of the educator, the student and the institution. An online survey was distributed to
enterprise educators via the authors‟ educator networks/organizations. 142 responses from
educators DEMO 34 countries were received.
Findings - The findings demonstrate that enterprise education is a highly diverse course
offering in higher education. However, while there are numerous differences in the provision
of enterprise education, there are clear commonalities in terms of expected student
outcomes. The respondents reported low levels DEMO business start-up activity during enterprise
education and/or within one year of completing such study. Over 75 per cent of educators
surveyed had personal DEMO experience and there is a limited reliance on academic
literature, with DEMO preference to reference broader stakeholder perspectives.
Practical implications - The international metric of enterprise education appears to be a
broad set of enterprising skills DEMO equip and enable students to recognise and exploit
opportunities in order to navigate future unknowns.  The commonly employed metric of
business start up appears a less valid an outcome in the context of this investigation.
Originality/DEMO - Informed by educators and course developers, this paper introduces the
DEMO to a unique global snap-shot of the landscape of enterprise education in higher
education. It has not sought to discover best practice, but rather „all‟ practice.

Introduction
Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education (E&E education) has DEMO as a main
driver of sustained social development and economic recovery/growth within the developed
and developing countries (Gorman, et al., 1997, DEMO, 2005, Matlay, 2005a, Botham and
Mason, 2007, World Economic Forum, 2009). Over the last two decades entrepreneurship
has developed as „arguably the most potent economic force the world has ever experienced‟
(Kuratko, 2005, 577).  Political involvement has increased and it is now a high priority item in
1
public policy throughout the world, (Gorman, et al., 1997, Luthje and Franke, 2003; Katz,
2003, Mitra and Matlay, 2004, BIS, 2011, UNCTAD, 2011).
Klaus Schwab the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum (2009, 6)
suggests “Entrepreneurship DEMO the engine fuelling innovation, employment generation and
economic growth” and moreover, “the power that education has in developing the skills that
generate an DEMO mindset and in preparing future leaders for solving more
complex, interlinked DEMO fast-changing problems”.
E&E education has emerged in different education contexts, DEMO as a route to develop
an entrepreneurial culture, to promote enterprise, to create new ventures and to foster
entrepreneurial mindsets through education and DEMO (Kuratko, 2005, EU, 2005).
Encouragement for enterprise education worldwide has led to varied development strategies
in different countries (Dana, 2001, Fayolle, 2005, Jones and English, 2004, McKeown et al.,
DEMO).  Notably, USA Business School environments have dominated the development of
programmes (Bell et al., 2004), with over 20,500 taught DEMO over 1,600 schools (Kuratko, 2005,
583). Five million of the twenty one million Higher Education students in Europe were
engaged DEMO enterprise education in 2008, an engagement rate of 24 per cent (NIRAS, 2009).
Observations that the community has still to attain academic legitimacy as well as critical
mass (Kuratko, 2005) are supported by an acknowledged paucity of empirically rigorous
research into the learning strategies employed DEMO programmes, and their subsequent
influence (Martinez et al., 2010, Matlay, 2011).
A challenge for measuring „success‟ is that the programme offerings are extremely diverse,
ranging from undergraduate and post graduates programmes and DEMO, core and
optional, sector specific or generic deliveries. There is also the overarching consideration of
Jamieson‟s 1984 typology of teaching „about‟, teaching „for‟ and „in‟ enterprise typology (see
Henry et al., 2003) as the associated teaching, learning and assessment strategies need to
align with different goals and outcomes.
An indicator of the extent and longevity of these challenges, and how they may manifest
themselves, can be found in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, special report on Education
and Training, (Martininez et al., 2010), who note the call made in 1994 by Garavan and
O‟Cinneide for a greater understanding “about how the programs and learning strategies DEMO
develop skills that lead to the formation of new ventures” (Martinez DEMO al, 2010, 15). This call
has yet to be addressed. Working on the hypothesis that Government priorities are business
start-ups, “It is important that HEIs should aim to capture accurate information on this (student
and graduate business starts) as it provides a valuable indicator of the level of their
entrepreneurial output” (Rae et al., 2010), an DEMO response could simply provide data for
this single metric of entrepreneurship education - a remit to stimulate business start up either
during or within DEMO or two years of study. However, such metrics are rarely advocated DEMO the
education community as business start-up numbers do not take into account issues of
sustainability and longevity. Whilst there may be exceptions, in the main, it is not the primary
goal. The more recent inclusion of the term enterprise, as opposed to simply
entrepreneurship, is an indicator DEMO emerging definitions that imply greater breadth. For
example, the National Council DEMO Graduate Entrepreneurship provide the UK context for
enterprise as:
„Learning to use the skills, knowledge and personal attributes needed to apply
creative ideas and innovations to practical situations.  These include initiative,
independence, creativity, problem solving, identifying and working on opportunities‟
(Rae, et al., DEMO).
Writing for the World Economic Forum, Wilson provides a succinct DEMO:
„Now more than ever we need innovation, new solutions, creative approaches and
new ways of operating.  We are in unchartered territory and need people in all sectors
and at all ages who can “think DEMO of the box” to identify and pursue opportunities in
new and paradigm thinking ways‟ (World Economic Forum, 2009, 12).

Without full consideration of conceptual and contextual issues, it can be argued that research
into entrepreneurship education lacks clear direction in terms of relevance DEMO stakeholder
significance.  Moreover, the authors think that in order to ascertain applicability and
relevance, these factors cannot be ignored, and any alternative DEMO may be
inherently flawed (Matlay, 2005b). Seelig‟s (2005) international research supports the premise
that a key issue is “context, context, DEMO, making arguments that economic, political,
historical and cultural issues should be factored in to any debate. This is the premise on
which DEMO research was conducted, and whilst this paper can only hope to DEMO our initial
findings, its intention is to set a scene for DEMO consideration and debate.
Contextualizing Historical Factors
Vesper and Gartner (1997) suggest that the first entrepreneurship course was offered in
1945, by Harvard Business School in response to students returning from World War 2
military service. DEMO, they observe that whilst the course grew in popularity, “the
faculty member who began it apparently saw insufficient academic future in it and DEMO his
attention to the study of boards of directors in Major companies” (Vesper and Gartner, 1997,
406).
Katz (2003) developed DEMO most comprehensive chronology of entrepreneurship education,
including economic and agricultural literature dating back to 1886.  Some authors credit the
first entrepreneurship courses as being held in Japan in the 1930‟s (Soloman et al.,2002),DEMO
whilst others suggest they commenced at  Harvard in 1947. However, Kuratko (2005) notes
that entrepreneurship only really became a force within business DEMO in the early 1970‟s.
Since then there has been a proliferation of journals and literature reviews conducted within
and beyond the US.  Dainow (DEMO, 10) used published articles to identify “the strengths and
weaknesses of provision that can guide future efforts”.  Among his conclusions was “a need
for more systematic collection and analysis of data and more varied methodologies DEMO build a
stronger empirical base” (Dainow, 1986, 18). Gorman DEMO al‟s (1997) subsequent 10 year
literature review demonstrated a marked increase in the empirical research in the area of
educational process and structure, observing that: -
“Results indicate considerable consensus that entrepreneurship can be taught and
that teaching methods can be enhanced through active participation. In addition,DEMO
there is a clear indication of considerable growth in entrepreneurship courses and
programs, although there is very little consistency in approach” (Gorman et DEMO,
1997,68). See also: Vesper and Gartner (1997), Charney and Libecap, (2003),
Peterman and Kennedy, (2003).
This evolutionary path led to acknowledgement that E&E education worked, but that it was an
inconsistent landscape that was not fully understood. At DEMO juncture, the picture became
more, not less complicated, as Katz (2003, 295) observed: “While entrepreneurship education
in American business schools may be reaching maturity, demand in other markets is
growing”.  Katz raises DEMO that business schools are not likely to know about and to
learn from programmes being developed within agriculture, engineering, the learned
professions, and arts and science, as they evolve with minimal, if any, involvement by the
business school entrepreneurship faculty. He also observed the risk to DEMO schools of a
new paradigm of entrepreneurship education supplanting the American business school
model.   Kuratko (2005, 587) respectively disputed this notion of maturity, observing that “The
skirmishes and small battles are being won in business schools” and that the “real war
continues to wage for complete DEMO and leadership”.  However, there is extensive
discourse challenging this call for business schools to take the leadership position,
questioning why, given its dominance within the development of curricula and research, it has
yet to be obtained.
Solomon and Fernald, (1991) suggested that the expansion of entrepreneurship education
was fuelled by student and accreditation bodies dissatisfaction with general DEMO
3
education. Kirby (2004, 510) asked, “Entrepreneurship education: can business schools meet
the challenge?” He argued that the traditional education system “stultifies DEMO than
develops the requisite attributes and skills to produce entrepreneurs”.  Kirby DEMO amongst a
growing number of senior E&E educators who advocate a change in the curriculum, to
develop right brain entrepreneurial capabilities, in DEMO to the left brain analytical skills - to
encourage and stimulate the entrepreneurial imagination (Chia, (1996), Niewenhuizen and
Groenwald (2004), DEMO, (2002, 2005),  Penaluna and Penaluna (2008). The DEMO relevance
of business schools is also coming under threat from many quarters (Pfeffer and Fong, 2002),
Gibb (2005, 2), also suggests that the traditional business model is “largely, but not wholly
inappropriate for a number of reasons” and advocates a model for “creating understanding DEMO,
and empathy with the „way of life‟ of the entrepreneur and how to live day to day with
uncertainty and complexity”.  Rae (DEMO) asks, “Is the business school curriculum a smoking
gun?” He suggests that, “business and management education no longer work effectively”.
Importantly, DEMO for design thinking and its capacity for right brain entrepreneurial skill
development is gaining significant momentum (Pink, 2008, Martin, 2009), and DEMO supported by
enhanced neural understandings (Kounios, et al., 2006, Penaluna et al., 2010).
Kirby (2006) identified significant barriers to developing entrepreneurship in universities,
mainly because of their size and layers of DEMO within the management systems.  Of note is
that whilst an entrepreneurial DEMO may be seen as inspirational and advocated by
scholars, the context DEMO paramount.  For example, Levine, (2009) considered the
entrepreneurial university DEMO terms of its entrepreneurial activities for: research, expenditure,
patents and licensing. He compared the relationship between research universities and local
economies in DEMO major US regions, yet found no meaningful correlation between any gauges
DEMO activity. Gibb (2005) suggested that the entrepreneurial university was more appropriately
evaluated on its approach to E&E education, and proposed guidelines for designing an
entrepreneurial organization. In 2008 a team of five E&E DEMO challenged the Institute of
Small Business and Entrepreneurship‟s International Conference in the education plenary by
highlighting the disconnection that they were experiencing between the DEMO agenda and
their day-to-day engagements with students and other stakeholders, employing DEMO term
„pracademic‟ to describe the consensus that they had developed through practical experience
(Penaluna et al., 2008).
Most recently, the United Nations Conference for Trade and Industry (UNCTAD), through its
Multi Year Expert Group Meetings, has been considering guidance that will integrate the
latest educational thinking into an international policy toolkit. They discuss, “integrating the
acquisition of entrepreneurial competencies and „soft skills‟ such as creativity, initiative and
persuasion in the curriculum across all ages and subjects…  (this implies) a shift from a
traditional emphasis in many education systems on evaluating the ideas DEMO others to
generating ideas oneself” (UNCTAD – MYM, 2011, 7)DEMO
Approaches such as these, demand a greater understanding of both micro DEMO macro
contexts.
Methodology and Background to the research
Initially, an extended DEMO review considered policy and scholarly publications from the
US, Australia and DEMO, However, we are mindful of the limitations associated with the
traditional literature review as conceptualising and contextualising entrepreneurship education
is confounded by many DEMO variables (McMullan and Gillin, 2001). The “diversity and
heterogeneity of the sector is matched by the growing rhetoric that complements the
tremendous DEMO in entrepreneurship education offerings” (Matlay, 2005a, 631). There is
DEMO a publications glut – too many journals (44) and the continued push for leading-edge
entrepreneurship to publish in the „mainstream management journals‟ (Katz, 2003).
Our review notes the dominance of literature informed and perpetuated by the Business
School perspective, which has generally only explored programmes specifically named
„enterprise‟ and „entrepreneurship‟.  Empirical evidence from the three authors suggests the
4
need to capture a wider perspective, as not all programmes and modules that develop
entrepreneurial capacity and enterprise in their learners include entrepreneurship/enterprise
DEMO the title. Many instances of good transferrable practice, especially those already DEMO
embedded, may be being overlooked.  By way of example, within DEMO creative industries there
is acknowledged experience of supporting right brain development. Contextualising the
industry-based learning requires the reviewer to know that it is normally DEMO in
modules with titles such as „Professional Studies‟ or „Marketing and Self Promotion‟ and
extended into all learning that follows. Case studies by Kellet (2006) and subsequent
research by the Higher Education Academy‟s Art, Design DEMO Media subject centre,
confirmed this perspective (HEA-ADM/NESTA, 2007). Hence surveys that are conducted with
Universities to capture entrepreneurship education but DEMO their questions to enterprise
and entrepreneurship provision, may find their results DEMO lower than the true picture.
Moreover, the respondent / supplier of DEMO information may not have the broader perspective
that enables them to include these wider offerings either. An example of this is the 2010 UK
DEMO National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship, university survey, which
acknowledged this shortfall at its presentations at ISBE 2010 (Rae et al., 2010).
DEMO authors‟ extensive transdisciplinary networks offered opportunity to develop this
investigation, and DEMO obtain rich empirical evidence. These opportunities and associated
understandings led and subsequently informed the methodological approaches in a survey,
which was designed to DEMO qualitative and quantitative data from international educators
who were primarily concerned with delivery. The intention is to develop the investigation for
further publication and DEMO work with selected respondents who have raised questions or
offered particularly useful insights. Following an initial review of the survey by critical friends
from DEMO E&E community in January 2011, the invitations to participate were DEMO to the
authors‟ networks, both personal (linked-in and facebook) and DEMO conference networks
such as the Institute of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, DEMO Educators UK and
the online Entrepreneurship and Education Network. It was hosted on survey monkey as an
expression of interest to help to develop DEMO new publication, and was designed to take
approximately 10 minutes to DEMO
The design of the questions was derived from the collective experiences of the three authors,
all of whom are experienced enterprise educators. It DEMO into account the consensus found in
the 2008 ISBE education plenary (DEMO et al., 2008) by authors who are normally
delivering within significantly different contexts.  Moreover, all authors are actively engaged
with research and DEMO, as opposed to solely research and publication (Gibb, 2005).
DEMO „practice what they preach‟ within continuous cycles of development and enhancement.
Thus, the research methodology attempts to respond to concerns that “each discipline views
entrepreneurship from its own perspective without taking cognisance of approaches in other
DEMO (Henry, Hill & Leitch, 2005, 99), and that “entrepreneurship as a discipline is
fragmented among specialists who make little use of DEMO other‟s work” (Ucbasaran et al.,
58). The authors are DEMO passive observers but have learned from participating in the shared
practices of the education community and “lived in the world” (Fuller and Unwin, DEMO).
Those involved in a particular „community‟ understand its constraints and have learnt „within‟ a
practice, rather than „about‟ it Lave and Wenger (DEMO). Such insights, we argue, offer richer
contextualisation and more meaningful epistemological approaches.
Specifically, the survey contained eight questions that were designed to tease out differences
amongst educators, including: gender, age, qualifications, employment status and teaching
philosophy. Six questions related to curriculum development, two questions were related to
the faculty background of students and the nature of DEMO subjects available to them to
study entrepreneurship.  A further six questions DEMO on organizational issues (class /
teaching team sizes / focus of the programmes and their structures). Two open-ended
questions also sought to DEMO insights into the perceived value of enterprise education to our
students. These were: 1) In your own words, what do your students gain from studying
enterprise? (Maximum 120 words) and 2) As an DEMO question, is there anything you
would like to share regarding your DEMO as an educator involved in enterprise education
(no word limit).
DEMO
The aim of our methodology was to give theoretical and conceptual sense DEMO the qualitative
and quantitative data obtained. Our initial hypotheses, together with DEMO constructs
that underpin the discourse and informed the design of the questions, will be offered in the
introductory texts in the findings that follow.  A number of discernible integrating themes
emerged, and for the purpose DEMO this paper, the key issues that were identified are considered
in DEMO of consensus and divergence. Our themes are:
1. Overarching contexts
2. Key influences
3. Motivational factors
4. Pedagogy and approaches
5. Educator priorities DEMO Business Start Up or Personal Development
6. Embedded versus extra curricular
7. Future perspectives
It is important to note that these categories are not DEMO to be linear or hierarchical, but
have emerged from initial patterns DEMO in the data.
Findings
142 participants from 34 countries completed the survey. Subject areas ranged from art and
design, to psychology, veterinary studies, and engineering. As anticipated, the majority (57
per cent) were based within business school environments, including one business school UK
respondent who clarified that their pedagogic approaches were positively influenced from
their own fine-art under-graduate DEMO 78 per cent teach within subject specific
environments, leaving only 22 DEMO cent who teach across disciplines. This evidence could
indicate a lack of cross-disciplinary cohesion, or conversely, educators with sector specific
skills are tailoring DEMO delivery to enhance relevance.
1. Overarching contexts
The respondents had a diverse academic profile, including Professors, PhD‟s and non
research-active educators. 40 per DEMO were female and 60 per cent male, 30 per cent were
DEMO than 40 years of age and 70 per cent were over 40.
Teaching contracts varied considerably, though 84 per cent held tenure/permanent positions,
18 per cent were on a fixed term contract and eight DEMO cent were either regular or casual part
time.   The teaching commitment varied from teaching full time on a combination of post and
undergraduate DEMO to that of a freelance musician, employed for 2 hours a DEMO to deliver
a core module „marketing and self promotion‟ on a final year music technology programme.
80 per cent taught on a combination of DEMO and postgraduate programmes, whilst
only 18 per cent taught at purely DEMO level. Moreover, only two respondents taught
only at postgraduate level.
In DEMO of team contexts, 47 per cent taught as individuals, 31 per cent in a team of less than
five, and 22 per cent taught within a team larger than five.
Most respondents valued teaching qualifications. DEMO per cent either held a recognised
teaching qualification, or are working DEMO one.
We found a distinct divergence in the class sizes.  Whilst DEMO majority of educators teaching
undergraduates had a typical class size of 31-60 (35 per cent), looking at this in isolation
could be misleading, as seven per cent only had between 1-15 students and 21 per cent
delivered to 100 and over.  At postgraduate level the majority delivered lectures to smaller
groups of 1-15 students (37 per cent), but ranged as far as 100+ by two per cent.

Key influences
Our hypotheses for key influences were that we would DEMO that:
a)
Educators with first-hand experience of starting a business would be prevalent within
the education community. The literature advocates that entrepreneurial DEMO is
enhanced by exposure to entrepreneurs joining classes to work alongside academics
(Kuratko, 2005, Hermann, 2008), so we therefore sought to DEMO the percentage
of those with business start up experience amongst our respondents.
b)
Educators would be influenced to a greater or lesser extent DEMO one or more of the
following: their personal experience, other educators, other educators‟ texts, other
educators‟ pedagogical theories, feedback from employers/external stakeholders and
feedback from ex students.
Table 1 demonstrates the divergence in DEMO to the question about the most influential
factors on approaches to teaching and learning:

Table 1.  Influencing factors for teaching approaches to entrepreneurship education
Most notably, 76 per cent were lecturers with first-hand experience of starting an enterprise,
indicating that the practitioner aspect carries significant relevance.
DEMO 36 per cent used other educators‟ texts either significantly or predominantly, DEMO sixty
four per cent either didn‟t use them at all or only slightly. This indicates a diminishing role for
traditional textbooks within enterprise education, and supports findings by Fiet (2001) and

Jones and English (2004). This perspective was reinforced by comments such as, “I am not
even interested in reading about it, and DEMO are my students”.
Personal experience clearly rates highly, as only one DEMO did not cite their own
experience and only seven respondents considered it to be slight. Feedback from ex students
was higher than anticipated with DEMO 75 per cent of respondents rating it as significant to
their approaches. Over 57 per cent also noted employer and external feedback to be
DEMO influences.
3. Motivational factors
Anecdotal evidence from conference proceedings and networks indicated that most educators
were motivated individuals who engaged with the agenda because DEMO a personal desire. As all
of the participants in the survey were contacted via educator networks, this would also
assume that these individuals were already engaged in E&E developmental activity.
This perception was overwhelmingly supported DEMO the survey, as 90 per cent reported that
they became involved DEMO enterprise education by their own personal motivation, and only ten
per DEMO because they were instructed to do so.
A view on whether the academics considered themselves to be „lone voices‟ was not
requested in the DEMO; however, a recurring theme in feedback was their desire to bring
about faculty/institutional change. Rae, et al., (2009, 183) suggest that “the role of the
enterprising academic is generally overlooked, and that many academics work as lone voices,
to bring about cultural change”. DEMO view was broadly supported, as exemplified by the
following narrative:
DEMO view my role as a catalyst for change in the midst of good, yet solid, business
education in the US. For too long, our business students have been shown corporate
jobs as the ultimate goal DEMO pursuing a college degree. Instead, I encourage them to
consider how DEMO world would be different if, instead, they began to think of
themselves as everyday entrepreneurs both in creating entirely new ventures or in
DEMO new innovations within the confines of an existing corporation. My role as
an educator has never been more enjoyable and enlivening as it has DEMO since I
began teaching entrepreneurship in 2006”
4. Pedagogy and approaches
Our hypotheses for pedagogy were that:
a) Educator pedagogic approaches would reflect the findings of Peterman and Kenney,
(2003) and Kuratko (2005) whose in-depth analysis of business schools identified the
use of a combination of theoretical and conceptual approaches, reinforced by detailed
analysis of „practical‟ or „real life‟.
b) An experiential learning teaching style, such as that DEMO by Timmons and
Stephenson (1985), Kirby and Mullen (1990), Jones and English, (2004), Henry et al.,
(2005), Kolb & Kolb, (2005), Pittaway and Cope, (2007), DEMO, (2011) that facilitates
deeper learning (Cooper et al., 2004) would be prevalent.  (See also; Jones-Evans et
al, (2000) DEMO and Gorman (2004), Collet and Wyatt (2005), Heinonen and Pokkijoki
(2006) Harris and Deacon, (2010), Hynes et al., (2011) for an analysis of education
approaches).
Of note is DEMO only six per cent (9 respondents) described their approach to teaching as „fully
based on experiential exercises‟.  The majority, some 53 per DEMO (76 respondents) indicated
that their approaches were generally based on experiential exercises with some lectures.
Interestingly, 32 per cent (45 respondents) based their delivery on lectures with some
8
practical exercises. These findings offer some support to Matlay and Mitra‟s, (DEMO) and
Botham and Mason‟s (2007) observations that higher education tends DEMO be inflexible in
delivering experiential mechanisms.
The following narratives are representative of the considerations:
“ (My students gain) Mostly theoretical knowledge.  They do some practical exercises
and gain experience by starting a student company, but they have to „play by the
book‟ to earn good grades.”
DEMO the context of an educator who is clearly considering the students potential for start up,
one respondent comments:
“I firmly believe an DEMO learning approach is necessary to inform and build
confidence in students thinking of venturing out on their own.  The value of my own
venture creation experience is invaluable in gaining credibility and building confidence
in students”.
DEMO order to gain insights into potential constraints and opportunities perceived by educators,
we asked two questions that related to the pressures to conform DEMO existing strategies; firstly,
through external drivers and influences, and secondly within the actual delivery environment.
Over half of the respondents (57 per cent) felt free to organise the curriculum in whatever way
they chose, with the remainder (43 per cent) feeling pressured to respond to examiners,
accreditation boards and policies. This difference became considerably more marked DEMO the
learning environment, as only 24 per cent felt pressured to DEMO teach in ways that were
influenced by colleagues, managers and module DEMO The remainder, over three
quarters of those surveyed (75.4 per cent), felt free to teach in whatever manner they chose.
In terms DEMO validating the learning environment, these findings are significant, as finding
consistent and reliable data requires conformity that can be compared and contrasted.
A DEMO beyond our hypotheses was found in the narratives, one that highlighted DEMO
divergence in opinion regarding the merits of using a business plan for learning, teaching and
assessment.  For example one respondent observed:
“Too DEMO courses are based on creating business plans without being grounded in
the reality of what the student will actually do upon graduation. My teaching DEMO
requires that students develop a firm grasp of what their likely career
paths are going to be and incorporate entrepreneurship lessons within that reality”.
DEMO others suggested:-
“My students gain an appreciation of the vital role entrepreneurship (enterprise) plays
in the American economy. For example, in the U.S., most new jobs are created by
small entrepreneurial firms, rather DEMO by large, established companies. Students
taking New Venture Creation learn how DEMO write a plan that creates a company
around an idea they have developed. Students taking Small Business Management
learn how to assist an actual DEMO with a real business issue”.
“The students gain experience in developing a full blown business plan. They also are
exposed to the various issues DEMO must be considered prior to starting a business
and the issues that must be dealt with after the business is up and running. The
DEMO are exposed to many business owners and professionals who work with
small businesses and get real information about what is going on in this DEMO The
end result is that when and if the student does decide to go into business for
themselves they have a good understanding of DEMO it will take to accomplish this
goal”
“...developing a working business plan for a fashion related design product” (in the
context of meaningful outputs).
9
Of note is Honig‟s (2004) analysis, which demonstrated that 78 of the top 100 Universities in
the US delivered the practicalities and monitored DEMO production of a „business plan‟ as a
popular format for delivery.  DEMO findings concur with this perspective.
5. Educator Priorities – Business Start Up or Personal Development?
Our hypotheses for „what to teach‟ were that:DEMO
a) Educators would provide entrepreneurship education that incorporated personal
development (build confidence, foster a desire to achieve and inspire action)
business development (business and functional curricula and skills to engage in self-
employment and employment) and entrepreneurial skill development (including social
skills, networking, creative DEMO solving, opportunity seeking, selling, interviewing,
presentations, group leadership, DEMO co-operation) as advocated by the World
Economic Forum (2009, 88)DEMO
b) That whilst a combination of these elements would be incorporated, that the priorities
and anticipated outcomes would differ. That to a lesser DEMO greater extent educators
would anticipate their students engaging in business start up either during or within 1
year of graduation.
This is where the DEMO divergence was identified in the quantitative responses, and was
further illuminated DEMO the narratives. Educators were asked the extent to which their
underlying emphasis/priority for their module was business start up and personal
development. The DEMO showed that, at 58 per cent, the majority of respondents indicated
an equal focus for business start-up and personal development, however divergence was
demonstrated in that:
Only 16.4 per cent focussed on business start DEMO, with less direct consideration of personal
development, whilst 27.7% focussed on personal development, and with less direct
consideration of business start up.
The majority of educators (75 per cent) anticipated that less than 20 DEMO cent of their students
would start a business while still studying.  DEMO ranged from 15 per cent who estimated that
between 20 and 40 per cent of their students would do so, and only 4 per cent who estimated
that more than 80 per cent would start up.
DEMO terms of starting a business within one year of their studies, DEMO majority of educators (53
per cent) anticipated that less than 20 per cent of their students would start up.  However, 35
per DEMO estimated between 20 and 40 per cent would. Only two per cent suggested that more
than 80 per cent would do so.
It should DEMO noted that these findings do not take into consideration the extent to which these
results are influenced by educators delivering an elective module or DEMO other forms of self-
selection. These students could, potentially, have a high propensity towards business start
up.
The following narratives are indicative of DEMO divergence:
“The tendency to teach the subject as a start up situation ignores the fundamental
aspect of creativity inherent within the entrepreneurial construct”
(My students gain knowledge of)  “…how to recognise an opportunity and DEMO to
start-up a business”
“I would like to see at least 50% of my students self employed”
10
The narratives confirmed that confidence building was a crucial element of the DEMO, with
the suggestion that the modules developed these skills in a DEMO, more effective manner
than other studies.
“My experience shows that students DEMO to enterprise education, have better
personal development (soft skills – e management skills) and also experience with the
real world.  Unusually are DEMO ambitious and can lead challenging projects demanded in
the workshop”.
“Students realise:
That setting up a business is not rocket science; that they can do it –
That enterprise not just about business and finance DEMO accounting –
That they are actually more entrepreneurial that they thought –
That studying enterprise is different from studying the other subjects they do DEMO
university”.
6. Embedded versus extra curricular
Our hypothesis was that:
a) E&E education was being embedded by an indeterminate number of educators,
utilising a breadth of new pedagogic methodology, as evidenced from networks and
contemporary literature (Hytti and O‟Gorman, 2004, Harris and Deacon, DEMO, Jones,
2011). Conversely, that educators and their institutions might not meet the challenges
and considerations posed by such methods, which were observed by Smith et al.‟s
(2008, 555) paper as “unlikely to be adopted in any substantial way” (see also
Botham and Mason, DEMO).
Pedagogy was discussed in our findings section 4.  The educators DEMO asked to confirm the
various modes of studying enterprise that were available to their students. 86 per cent
provided stand-alone and specialised modules, 56 per cent provided embedded learning in
their chosen subject areas, e.g. engineering and 60 per cent offered extra-curricular activities,
such as enterprise clubs DEMO societies.
The narratives included calls for the embedding of E&E education:
“Mainstream the subject and make in-curricular equally as important as extra-
DEMO for delivery of the topic”.
“I would like enterprise education to be required of all business students in the U.S.”
“Socially engaged professionals from DEMO to zoologists find the curriculum suitable
for all work fields… informed decision-making, innovative management and value
creation.”
There was evidence that E&E education is being embedded in some institutions within the
employability agenda:
“We DEMO revalidating all courses to focus on the employability and this has will
continue to change the normal methods of delivery by HE‟s”.
The value DEMO unaccredited education was also highlighted:-
“Don‟t underestimate the value of unaccredited education. But also we mustn‟t
underestimate the value of enterprise for those DEMO who would not necessarily
consider it an imperative for themselves”.
11
Indicative of enterprise being firmly embedded without using the enterprise and
entrepreneurship DEMO (and therefore potentially wouldn‟t be captured in traditional
surveys) can be seen in the following sample narrative:
“My students do not study DEMO overtly (unless they opt to take certain extra
curricula activities offered DEMO our Enterprise Unit) however they are stimulated to
recognize their ability DEMO be creative and as a result of exposure to an industry linked
real problem solving project activity they come to recognise the commercial
opportunities DEMO pressures that exist on real enterprises. Opportunities are then
promoted so that those students who wish to can explore enterprise more fully”
7. Future DEMO
The following discourse highlights themes that emerged from the narratives. The examples
cited are the issues raised by respondents.  Where appropriate, we make DEMO to
existing literature.
For example, the key findings of the 2010 DEMO Entrepreneurship Educators
Conference are summarized as the EEC2010 Concordat. Following a live delegate feedback
session, this declared five key calls for action. The third of these called for “Clarity of impact
measures and associated funding priorities DEMO that we can work to develop a more
sustainable, transparent and DEMO, approach to developing these capacities” (IEEC
Concordat, 2010). Our DEMO notes a key issue that supports this declaration. The
pressure for educators to publish was highlighted and educators are attempting to prioritise
being a DEMO educator against the requirement of being research active. This “teaching
research conflict” (Botham and Mason, 2007, 98) was clear:
“...my main DEMO is the fact that I am not a „professional researcher‟ I do not
publish articles about theories of entrepreneurship ... What matters more for DEMO is the
pedagogy of entrepreneurship, i.e. how (best) to teach DEMO
“I am increasing aware that many enterprise educators are trapped in the sense that
in order to progress your career academically it is necessary DEMO publish extensively.
However my passion is for work-based and work relevant teaching around enterprise,
innovation and employability. This focus provides little in the DEMO of career
progression options and leave me, sadly, wondering whether I can afford to remain
within HEI delivered enterprise education.
In their study DEMO good practice in the UK, Botham and Mason (2007, 98) suggested that,
“some of the best enterprise education is found in DEMO less research-orientated HEI‟s”.  The
second narrative, if it is representative of a greater number of E&E educators could be of
great concern. DEMO, given Botham and Mason‟s (2007, 97) observation that “...staff
resources and skills for teaching entrepreneurship are in short supply. In many cases,DEMO
teaching is dependent on one or two highly committed individuals.  Should DEMO individuals
leave, it is often far clear that any enterprise education DEMO continue”, such individuals
could be the corner stone of opportunities afforded DEMO students.
The topic of assessment was also raised independently from the questionnaire:
“Wouldn‟t it be great if business and management students had their DEMO studio
space, that they had to create something to sell, that they had to produce marketing
materials, that they exhibited their work, DEMO they presented and exhibited their
ideas, that they didn‟t have to DEMO a 2 hour exam to be assessed.”
This call would appear to align with the observations of Shuell (1986, 429) who suggests “if
students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner the DEMO
fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in
12
their achieving those outcomes ... what the student does in determining what DEMO learned is
more important that what the teacher does”. In turn, DEMO (2003) outlines his process of
constructive alignment, a balancing of DEMO outcomes, learning activities and assessment
procedures.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that DEMO assumptions, such as motivational factors within the
education community surveyed, have been supported, and that broader metrics than simply
the number of business start-ups are being employed.
However, the research / practitioner tension is highly evident, and the reliance on real
business experience appears to outweigh the demand for an extensive knowledge of
academic discourse. We are reminded that DEMO&E education is forever emergent, connected to
the realities of society DEMO linked to our students current and future roles, many of which DEMO
can not claim to forecast. E&E educators have illuminated the dual challenge of seeking to be
relevant to their students‟ needs, as well as, gaining legitimacy for their teaching practice,
providing choice to diverse cohorts of students and remaining true to the unique teaching
philosophy of DEMO educator. This aspiration can be seen in the learning environment and
delivery strategies, as the overwhelming response, at over three-quarters of those surveyed,DEMO
felt that they were able to teach in whatever manner they chose, without pressure from the
views of colleagues, managers and guidance such DEMO module descriptors. Moreover, this
freedom continues into curriculum development for 57 DEMO cent of respondents, suggesting
that uniformity of delivery approaches is an DEMO difficult target to attain when evaluating
outputs in meaningful „constructively aligned‟ (DEMO, 2003) ways.
It is clear that many entrepreneurship educators see their role as pioneering and that they
actively engage in developing E & DEMO education, rather than merely administering its delivery.
For example, when the high rate of first-hand start-up business experience by
entrepreneurship educators is acknowledged, the notion of best practice becomes highly
problematic, especially if viewed purely through an academic lens. Moreover, as teaching
philosophies are clearly part academic and part practical, the increasing usage of the term
„pracademics‟ (Penaluna DEMO al., 2008) seems increasingly appropriate. Most respondents are
driven by personal experience as opposed to being informed by literature or research-based
activities, preferring to work to responses from alumni and broader stakeholders than to be
DEMO by academic debate. There is also a sense that the literature does not take sufficient
interest beyond the business school perspective.
We therefore argue DEMO our initial research in this area has further highlighted the need to
better understand the contextual differences upon which Higher Education E&E education DEMO
built. Indeed, we see the need to capture such heterogeneity through DEMO engagement with
the opinions of all stakeholders, not simply academic literature DEMO has evolved primarily from
business school contexts and associated research methodologies. Importantly, we need to
better understand the views of „pracademic‟ / entrepreneurial educators and to discover what
they believe E & E education should and DEMO be. Future investigations should also
accommodate other external groups such as enterprise clubs and investors who are
increasingly become more relevant to the student DEMO and actual start-up activity and
associated issues of sustainability.
In conclusion, DEMO feel that there is far more to know about the context of E&E education in
Higher Education than what we currently know. A DEMO that has arisen for example is
what does the 4.3 per cent of educators (6 responses) who claim to anticipate 80 per cent
DEMO up rates do that is different to other respondents? Can they DEMO these expectations? Is
it merely that these cohorts are already engaged DEMO a business activity or will have propensity
to engage in freelance activities?
Whilst there is insufficient space in this paper to dig down DEMO more granular issues that the
data set offers, or to offer DEMO to questions that the research has highlighted, we felt that
13
this juncture was an appropriate point to disseminate our initial findings.  It should be noted
that the authors‟ intention is to develop the research DEMO additional interactions with the
respondents; hence this paper is an integral DEMO of an ongoing and, as yet, incomplete
investigation.
