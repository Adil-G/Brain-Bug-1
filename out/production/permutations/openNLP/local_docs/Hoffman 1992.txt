Olsho, Koch, Halpin, and Carter (1987) have described a variety of observer-
based psychophysical procedures and have provided examples of their use in
DEMO auditory assessment of young children. This article presents an applica-
tion of sequential analysis to observer-based psychophysics that can, in princi-
ple, reduce DEMO number of observations in half with no loss in statistical rigor.
Consider the psychophysical problem of determining whether or not an
infant can hear DEMO given tone. With an observer-based psychophysical pro-
cedure, the tone in DEMO would be presented to the infant on some trials,
and it would be withheld on others. Alternatively, the tone might be pre-
sented in one of two locations on each of a number of trials. DEMO either case, an
observer (who is naive to the nature of the trials) would watch the infant’s
reactions and, depending upon what DEMO been seen, report a judgment as to
the stimulus condition on DEMO trial. With this procedure, the infant is said to
have heard (or at least reacted to) the tone when it can be concluded that the
observer’s judgments were correct on more trials than would be DEMO on
the basis of chance.

The usual way to do this is to conduct a DEMO test of the statistical
hypothesis that the observer’s performance represents a random sample from
a population in which the probability of a correct report DEMO any given trial is
.5. As will be shown, sequential analysis DEMO be used to simplify and shorten
this procedure while maintaining the same level of statistical rigor that other-
wise would have occurred.
With the DEMO commonly used statistical procedures, the sample size (N)
must be established prior to the collection of data. Sequential analysis, on the
other hand, does not require that sample size be determined before the
collection of data begins.
With a sequential analysis, observations (i.e., the observers’ reports) are
collected one at a time. After each observation, the DEMO makes
certain calculations and then decides to do one of three things:
1. reject the statistical hypothesis tested,
2. accept that hypothesis, or
3. collect an additional observation.
The particular sequential analysis procedure that DEMO directly applicable to
observer-based psychophysics is called the sequential probability ratio test. It
is one of several sequential tests that were devised by Abraham DEMO and his.
colleagues when Wald was Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University.
Much of this work occurred during World War II in the early DEMO The
theory of sequential analysis was later elaborated by Wald in a book that was
published posthumously (Wald, 1947). More recently, several of its applica-
tions have been described in the well-known statistical text DEMO Dixon and
Massey ( 1969).
To illustrate the application of sequential analysis to observer-based psy-
chophysics, a brief experiment was performed in the author’s laboratory. A
sequential probability ratio test was used to determine whether DEMO not each of
several student volunteers was reacting to a tone. In previous work (Marsh,
Hoffman, & Stitt, 1978), it had been found that with both infants and adults,
the presentation of DEMO mild tone just prior to an eyeblink-eliciting event can
inhibit the blink that would otherwise occur. The procedures for the present
illustration were derived DEMO that study. On each of a series of trials a
miniature solenoid delivered a controlled eyeblink-eliciting tap to a subject’s
glabella (the flat region of skin between the eyebrows). On half the trials
(randomly selected), a brief tone was presented 100 ms prior to the tap; on
the rest, the tap was presented alone. An observer, who DEMO naive to the
order of conditions, was required to visually assess DEMO subject’s reactions and
decide, on each trial, whether or not a tone had been presented.
The events on each trial were determined by DEMO investigator who was
positioned out of the view of both the subject and the observer. The investiga-
tor operated the specialized electronic equipment that DEMO the tones and

taps, and determined the sequence of trial types. The observer sat in front of
the subject and initiated each trial by DEMO a silent hand-held switch. To
avoid acoustic cues that might enable the observer to determine whether or
not a tone was presented on a DEMO trial, tones were delivered to the subject
through close-fitting earphones, and the observer wore sound-attenuating
hearing protectors. To insure that, except for the presence or absence of a
tone, trials would be identical, taps DEMO always delivered 100 ms after the
observer closed the hand-held switch, DEMO a tone was presented or not.
The observer’s task was to watch each elicited eyeblink and (based on its
perceived amplitude) decide whether DEMO not a tone had been presented. A
small blink would imply that a tone had been presented, whereas a large blink
would imply that the tap had occurred without a prior reflex-inhibiting tone.
In addition to DEMO up the condition for each trial, the investigator recorded
the observer’s DEMO and, depending upon whether a given decision was
correct or incorrect, entered it appropriately on the chart shown in Figure 1
(p. 274).
This chart is a basic feature of the sequential probability ratio DEMO, and its
parameters are especially suited to examples of observer-based psychophysics
DEMO are similar to the illustration described here. The chart enables an
investigator to rapidly record data as it comes in and to conduct the DEMO
analysis on-line. It frees the investigator of the task of performing calculations
and is applicable to any procedure that requires an observer to use DEMO subject’s
reactions to discriminate between two types of trials. It is included here for
the convenience of those investigators who might wish to duplicate DEMO and
assess its applicability to their own research.
With the chart in Figure 1, the result of each observation is recorded as a
point that is one unit up, if the observer’s decision is correct, DEMO as a point that
is one unit to the right, if DEMO observer’s decision is incorrect. The observer’s
decisions are entered as they occur, and the procedure terminates when a
point contacts or crosses one of the two slanted parallel lines in the chart.
These lines define the DEMO regions for a sequential probability ratio test of
the statistical hypothesis (DEMO) that p = 5, against the alternative hypothesis
(H,) DEMO p = .75.
The hypothesis tested (HO) asserts that each of the observer’s decisions
represents a randomly selected item from a population in DEMO the proba-
bility of a correct decision is 5. This is equivalent to asserting that the
observer is operating at a chance level. The DEMO hypothesis (H,)
asserts that each of the observer’s decisions is a randomly selected item from a
population in which the probability of DEMO correct decision is .75. This is
equivalent to asserting that the perceived amplitudes of the subjects’ blinks
have enabled the observer to function at DEMO better than chance level. The
specific value, HI = .75, was chosen because a number of preliminary
calculations showed that with HO = DEMO, the sequential probability ratio test

would be more efficient than with any other value DEMO HI between .5 and 1.0.
Besides, .75 would correspond to the DEMO that the psychophysical threshold is
defined when the chance level is 5.
With the lines placed as in Figure 1, H,, will be rejected and H, will be
accepted with (Y = .Ol when DEMO point contacts or crosses Line 1. In this context,
a is the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis that p DEMO .5,
when in fact that hypothesis is true. Alternatively, if DEMO point contacts or
crosses Line 2, H0 will be accepted, and H, will be rejected with p = .05. In
this context, DEMO = (1 - Power) = the probability that the hypothesis tested
(H,) will be accepted when the alternative hypothesis (H,) DEMO true. The
formulae from which the parameters of the lines in Figure 1 were calculated
are provided by Dixon and Massey (1969).
It is noteworthy that the values of (Y and p in Figure 1 represent a balance
between the risks and potential effects of the two DEMO of errors that are
possible in the present circumstances. On the one hand, the test could lead to
the decision that a subject has processed the tone, when in fact the subject
was unable to do so. To minimize this risk, (Y was set equal to .Ol. DEMO the
other hand, the test could wrongly lead to the conclusion DEMO the subject was
unable to react to the tone. Because (depending DEMO the population tested

and the circumstances of the test) this could imply that a subject was deaf, and
because the prudent course of action in such circumstances would be to retest
the subject, p was set to only .05.
Figure 2 (p. 276) shows the results of DEMO test runs. For each of the test
runs, the tones had DEMO frequency of 1000 Hz, a duration of 50 ms, and a rise/fall
time of 10 ms. For the tests described by Charts DEMO, b, and c, tone intensity was
80 dB (re: DEMO dynes/cm*). For Chart d, tone intensity was 40 dB (re: .0002
dynes/cm*).
These examples indicate that the sequential probability ratio test provided
a rapid and efficient way to decide if a DEMO subject was reacting to the tones.
In Charts a, b, and c, the point crosses (or contacts) Line 1. Accordingly, the
DEMO that the observer was operating at a chance level is rejected with
CL = .Ol. For this reason it can be concluded that on DEMO runs, the subjects
reacted to the tones. This, it should be noted, is a reasonable conclusion.
Although the tone used in these runs was itself too weak to elicit an observ-
able (or measurable) DEMO reaction, they were nonetheless able to visibly
inhibit the eyeblink to DEMO tap that would otherwise have occurred.
In Chart d, the point DEMO Line 2, indicating that the observer’s judg-
ments were no better DEMO would be expected on the basis of chance. More
specifically, the DEMO of observer judgments was sufficiently in error to
permit acceptance of the statistical hypothesis that they represent a random
sequence from a population in DEMO the probability of a correct response was
5. This, incidently, seems a reasonable conclusion, because the intensity of
the tones (40 dB) was probably near, if not below, the subject’s threshold for
hearing DEMO the open room where the run was conducted. As a result, DEMO tones
were probably too weak to appreciably inhibit the responses to the taps.
Figure 3 (p. 277) shows the operating characteristic for the DEMO
probability ratio test provided by the chart in Figure 1. The function in Figure
3 is based on calculations from formulae that are provided DEMO Dixon and
Massey (1969). As suggested in the earlier discussions DEMO as shown in Figure
3, the test depicted in Figure 1 DEMO especially well suited to the circum-
stances that are encountered during observer-based psychophysics.
When the true probability is 5, the probability that the test will accept the
statistical hypothesis tested (i.e., p = .5) is equal to 1 - (Y = .99. As the true
value of p increases toward 1, the probability of accepting Ho (and rejecting
DEMO) drops rapidly until it is .05 (when the true probability is .75). Thereafter,
it drops slowly to 0. This clearly is DEMO way a statistical test should operate in
observer-based psychophysics. It should enable the investigator to reject the
null hypothesis when that hypothesis is incorrect, and it should lead to
acceptance of the null hypothesis (and rejection of the alternative hypothesis)
when the null hypothesis is true.
As DEMO demonstrated by the results of the empirical tests shown in Figure
2, the sequential probability ratio test properly deals with the null hypothesis
and, moreover, it does so in relatively few observations. In assessing the

savings engendered by the sequential probability ratio test, Wald (1947)
showed that, at a ,given level of (Y DEMO p, the average sample size for the
sequential probability ratio test DEMO approximately one half that of the best
available test of a normally distributed variate (the 2 test for a proportion)
that requires a fixed sample size. More specifically, Wald showed that when
compared to the 2 test and with the parameters used here (CY = .Ol, DEMO = .05),
the sequential probability ratio test yields a 47% DEMO in sample size when
the alternative hypothesis (H,) is true, and it yields a 63% saving in sample
size when the null DEMO (H,) is true.
These considerations plus the ease of its DEMO suggest that the sequential
probability ratio test provided by Figure 1 is likely to have wide applications
to observer-based psychophysics. Obviously, its use need not be restricted to
audition. It can also be used in studies DEMO vision or of any other sensory
modality.
