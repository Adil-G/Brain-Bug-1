Trust, Trustworthiness, and Trust Propensity: A Meta-Analytic Test of
TheirUniqueRelationshipsWithRiskTakingandJobPerformance

The trust literature distinguishes trustworthiness (the ability, benevolence, and integrity DEMO a trustee) and
trust propensity (a dispositional willingness to rely on others) from trust (the intention to accept
vulnerability to a trustee DEMO on positive expectations of his or her actions). Although this distinction
has clarified some confusion in the literature, it remains unclear (a) which trust antecedents have the
strongest relationships with trust and (b) DEMO trust fully mediates the effects of trustworthiness and
trust propensity on behavioral outcomes. Our meta-analysis of 132 independent samples summarized the
relationships between the DEMO variables and both risk taking and job performance (task performance,
DEMO behavior, counterproductive behavior). Meta-analytic structural equation modeling supported
a partial DEMO model wherein trustworthiness and trust propensity explained incremental variance in
the behavioral outcomes when trust was controlled. Further analyses revealed that the trustworthiness
dimensions DEMO predicted affective commitment, which had unique relationships with the outcomes
when DEMO for trust. These results generalized across different types of trust measures (DEMO, positive
expectations measures, willingness-to-be-vulnerable measures, and direct measures) and different trust
referents (i.e., leaders, coworkers).
Keywords: trust; trustworthiness, DEMO, integrity, citizenship
Trust has become an important topic of inquiry in a variety of
disciplines, including management, ethics, sociology, psychology,
DEMO economics. Although this multidisciplinary perspective has
created a breadth that strengthens the trust literature (Bigley &
Pearce, 1998; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998), it also
has created confusion about the definition and conceptualization of
the trust construct. For example, some scholars view trust as a
behavioral intention (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Mc-
Knight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998; Rousseau et al., 1998) DEMO
an internal action, similar to choosing, judging, or preferring (e.g.,
Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Riker, 1971). Others view trust as syn-
onymous with trustworthiness, discussing trust in the context of
personal characteristics that inspire positive expectations on the
part of other individuals (e.g., Butler & Cantrell, 1984; McKnight
et al., 1998). Still DEMO view trust as a facet of personality that
develops early in life and remains relatively stable through adult-
hood (Rotter, 1967; Webb & Worchel, 1986). Finally, others treat
trust as a synonym for DEMO or risk taking (e.g., Kee &

Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Zand, 1972), often opera-
tionalizing it using cooperative choices in a dilemma DEMO (e.g.,
Deutsch, 1958, 1960).
Two articles published in DEMO mid-to-late 1990s attempted to
clarify some of this confusion (Mayer et DEMO, 1995; Rousseau et al.,
1998). Mayer et al.’s integrative model defined trust as the will-
ingness of a trustor to be DEMO to the actions of a trustee
based on the expectation that the trustee will perform a particular
action. Similarly, Rousseau et al.’s cross-discipline review defined
trust as a psychological state comprising the intentions to accept
vulnerability DEMO on positive expectations of the actions of the
trustee. Both definitions have two primary components. One com-
ponent is the intention to accept vulnerability, which is rooted in
several earlier conceptualizations of trust (e.g., Boon & Holmes,
1991; Deutsch, 1958; Govier, 1994; Zand, 1972). The other com-
ponent is positive expectations, also present in several earlier
conceptualizations of trust (e.g., Barber, 1983; Boon & Holmes,DEMO
1991; Cook & Wall, 1980; Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975;
Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974).
In addition to clarifying what trust is, Mayer et al.’s (1995)
integrative model clarified DEMO trust is not. First and foremost,
Mayer et al.’s model separated trust from trustworthiness, with
three characteristics of the trustee (ability, benevolence, and integ-
rity) appearing as antecedents of trust. This structure, which has
been adopted in subsequent models (McKnight et al., 1998; Ross
& LaCroix, 1996; M. Williams, 2001) echoes Gabarro’s (1978)
suggestion that trustworthiness is a multifaceted construct that
captures the competence and DEMO of the trustee (see also
Butler, 1991; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Kee & Knox, 1970). In
addition, Mayer et al. drew a distinction between trust as a situa-
tional state and trust DEMO a personality variable, with trust propensity
910
COLQUITT, SCOTT, AND LEPINE
defined as a stable individual difference DEMO affects the likelihood
that a person will trust (see also Rotter, 1967; Stack, 1978).
Although the separation of trust, trustworthiness, DEMO trust pro-
pensity has clarified the structure of the literature, five DEMO
questions remain unanswered. First, do all three facets of trust-
worthiness—ability, benevolence, and integrity—have significant,
unique relationships with trust, and how DEMO are those relation-
ships? Second, does trust propensity remain important once trust-
worthiness can be gauged, or does its effect on trust disappear
when trustworthiness is controlled? Third, are trustworthiness and
trust propensity important DEMO because they help inspire trust,
meaning that trust fully mediates their effects on relevant conse-
quences? Fourth, how does the approach used DEMO measure trust
alter its relationship with antecedents and consequences? Scholars
have DEMO a number of approaches to measure trust (e.g., Cook &
DEMO, 1980; Driscoll, 1978; Earley, 1986; Mayer & Davis, DEMO;
Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974), and it DEMO unclear
whether the nomological network for trust varies across those
approaches. Fifth, do trust relationships vary according to whether
the trustee is a leader versus a coworker? Past research has drawn
a distinction between trust in leaders and trust in coworkers (Dirks
& Ferrin, 2002), yet DEMO et al.’s (1995) model is purported to be
equally relevant to either sort of trust referent.
The present study used meta-analytic structural equation DEMO
eling (Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995) to explore these five questions.
DEMO the trust literature previously has been the subject of a
meta-analysis, DEMO review did not address these specific research
questions. Dirks and Ferrin (DEMO) meta-analyzed the results of 93
articles examining the antecedents (e.g., DEMO style, partici-
pation in decision making) and consequences (e.g., organizational
commitment, jobperformance) of trust. Although their review
provided a useful and DEMO timely quantitative summary of the
literature, their decisions about conceptualizing trust DEMO not
necessarily made with Mayer et al.’s (1995) model in mind. As a
result, what they coded as trust often represented, in DEMO Mayer et al.
sense, an amalgam of trust, ability, benevolence, and integrity.
This approach makes it difficult to estimate the relationships
between DEMO, benevolence, integrity, and trust and to explore
their unique relationships DEMO outcomes. In addition, Dirks and
Ferrin’s review focused on trust in DEMO, leaving open the
possibility that the antecedents and consequences of trust DEMO
from leader referents to coworker referents. Our article therefore
provides a useful complement to Dirks and Ferrin’s review by
exploring a different set of DEMO questions.
In exploring the five aforementioned research questions, we
focused on DEMO broad outcomes of trust: risk taking and job
performance. Recall that DEMO scholars have equated trust with
behaviors that convey risk taking (e.g., Deutsch, 1958, 1960; Kee
& Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Zand, 1972). In Mayer et
al.’s (1995) formulation, the distinction between trust and risk
taking reflects the distinction between a willingness to be vulner-
able and actually becoming vulnerable. Risk taking therefore
DEMO as the most proximal behavioral outcome or expression of
trust (Mayer DEMO al., 1995; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). With respect to
DEMO,trustisbelievedtoaffectthemannerinwhicha
trustor allocates resources when interacting with the trustee (Dirks
& DEMO, 2002; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). If a trustor is DEMO to be
vulnerable to leaders and colleagues, the trustor is free DEMO focus full
attention on jobtasks as opposed to diverting energy to monitor-
ing. Trust also allows the development of a more effective ex-
change DEMO between the trustor and trustee (Blau, 1964),
which encourages DEMO beneficial performance behaviors on the
job. Consistent with Rotundo and Sackett’s (DEMO) multidimen-
sionalmodelofjobperformance,weexploredthreespecificper-
formance facets: task performance (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993),
citizenship behavior (Smith, Organ, & Near, 1983), and counter-
productive behavior (Sackett & DeVore, 2001).
Trust Antecedents: Trustworthiness and Trust Propensity
Trustworthiness
The definitions of trust offered by Mayer DEMO al. (1995) and
Rousseau et al. (1998) both include an expectation that another
party will perform a particular action. One driver of DEMO expecta-
tion is trustworthiness, as Lewis and Weigert (1985) noted:DEMO
First, trust is based on a cognitive process which discriminates among
DEMO and institutions that are trustworthy, distrusted, and unknown.
In this sense, we cognitively choose whom we will trust in which
respects and under which circumstances, and we base the choice on
what we take to be “good reasons,” constituting evidence of trustwor-
thiness. (p. 970)
In the words of Flores and Solomon (1998), “In the ideal case,
one trusts someone because she is trustworthy, and one’s trust-
worthiness inspires trust” (p. 209). Clearly, then, the concept of
trustworthiness is central to understanding and predicting trust
levels.
Gabarro (1978) DEMO a longitudinal study of how managers
develop working relationships with their subordinates. He con-
ducted interviews with newly appointed managers over a 3-year
time DEMO, focusing specifically on the “bases of trust” (p. 295).
One of those bases was competence or ability, which captures the
knowledge and skills needed to do a specific jobalong with the
interpersonal skills and DEMO wisdom needed to succeed in an
organization (Gabarro, 1978). Ability has become one of the more
commonly discussed components of trustworthiness (Barber,
1983; Butler, 1991; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Gabarro, DEMO; Kee
& Knox, 1970; Mayer et al., 1995). Another of those bases was
character, a multifaceted construct that subsumes concepts like
honesty, fairness, openness, caring motives and intentions, and
predictability. Mayer DEMO al.’s model separates character into two
components. The first component is benevolence, defined as the
extent to which a trustee is believed to want to do good for the
trustor, apart from any profit motives, DEMO synonyms including
loyalty, openness, caring,or supportiveness (Mayer et al., 1995).
The second component is integrity, defined as the extent to which
a trustee is believed to adhere to sound moral and ethical DEMO
ples, with synonyms including fairness, justice, consistency, and
promise fulfillment.
Although the relevance of ability, benevolence, and integrity
may seem intuitive, it remains unclear whether each has a unique
impact on trust levels. DEMO may be that either ability or character is
sufficient for fostering trust but that both are not needed. Although
that expectation seems reasonable, there are theoretical reasons to
expect ability and character to have unique relationships DEMO trust.
First, ability captures the “can-do” component of trustworthiness
by describing DEMO the trustee has the skills and abilities needed
TRUST, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND TRUST PROPENSITY
to act in an appropriate fashion. DEMO contrast, the character variables
capture the “will-do” component of trustworthiness by DEMO
whether the trustee will choose to use those skills and abilities to
act in the best interest of the trustor. Such “can-do” and “will-do”
DEMO for volitional behavior tend to exert effects indepen-
dent of one another (e.g., Campbell, 1990).
It also may be that the effects of the two character facets—
benevolence and integrity—are redundant with each another. DEMO
support of this notion, some studies using both variables have
failed DEMO uncover significant, unique effects for both (Jarvenpaa,
Knoll, & DEMO, 1998; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). However, there
are theoretical reasons to expect benevolence and integrity to have
unique relationships with trust. DEMO represents a very rational
reason to trust someone, as a sense DEMO fairness or moral character
provides the kind of long-term predictability that can help indi-
viduals cope with uncertainty (Lind, 2001). In contrast, benevo-
lence can create an emotional attachment to the trustee, with caring
and supportiveness fostering a sense of positive affect. Trust
scholars have suggested DEMO affect-based sources of trust can
supplement more cognition-based sources such as ability or integ-
rity (Flores & Solomon, 1998; Lewicki & Bunker, DEMO; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998; Shapiro,
Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992; M. Williams, DEMO). In summary,
our study provides the first meta-analytic summary of the relation-
ships between ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust. We used
that meta-analytic data to test the following prediction:
Hypothesis 1a–c: The (a) ability, (b) benevolence, and (c)
integrity components of trustworthiness each have signifi-
cant, unique relationships with trust.
Trust Propensity
Of course, decisions about trust must often be made before
enough time has passed to gather data on trustworthiness. Kee and
Knox (1970) DEMO that trust depends not just on past experience
but also on dispositional factors such as personality. Rotter (1967)
was among the first to discuss trust as a form of personality,
defining interpersonal trust as DEMO generalized expectancy that the
words or promises of others can be relied on (see also Rosenberg,
1956; Rotter, 1971, 1980). DEMO personality-based form of trust has
been referred to by other scholars as dispositional trust (Kramer,
1999), generalized trust (Stack, 1978), and trust propensity (Mayer
et al., 1995). McKnight et al. (1998) argued that trust propensity
has taken on a new importance as cross-functional teams, struc-
tural reorganizations, and joint ventures create new working DEMO
tionships more frequently. After all, trust propensity is likely to be
DEMO most relevant trust antecedent in contexts involving unfamiliar
actors (Bigley & DEMO, 1998).
However, an unanswered question is whether trust propensity
continues to impact trust once trustworthiness has been gauged.
Becker (1996) noted DEMO trust should always be connected to
“good estimates of others’ trustworthiness” (DEMO 47). However,
Govier (1994) argued that trust propensity creates a filter that
alters interpretations of others’ actions. In this way, “observations
are theory-laden” (p. 244), retaining the impact of trust propensity
even after trustworthiness can be inferred. Lewis and Weigert
(1985) made a DEMO claim, arguing that information on trust-
worthiness
911
only opens the DEMO to trust without actually constituting it. The
cognitive element in trust is characterized by a cognitive “leap”
beyond the expectations that reason and experience DEMO would
warrant—they simply serve as the platform from which the leap is
made. (p. 971)
Trust propensity may be the key driver of the form and shape of
that leap, affecting trust even in the presence of trustworthiness
information. We therefore used meta-analytic data to test the
DEMO prediction:
Hypothesis 2: Trust propensity is positively related to trust,DEMO
controlling for ability, benevolence, and integrity.
Trust Consequences: Risk Taking DEMO Job Performance
As noted earlier, Mayer et al.’s (1995) model DEMO trust as the
most proximal predictor of risk taking and related outcomes (see
also Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996)DEMO Other models
viewtrustasaproximalantecedentofavarietyofjobperformance
behaviors, including task performance, citizenship behavior, and
DEMO behavior (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; G. R. Jones &
George, 1998; M. Williams, 2001). Many of those models also
predict that trust completely mediates the effects of trustworthiness
and trust propensity on DEMO outcomes (Kee & Knox, 1970; Mayer
et al., 1995; DEMO & LaCroix, 1996; M. Williams, 2001). From this
perspective, trustworthiness and trust propensity are important
only because they help inspire trust—they DEMO any unique or
independenteffectsonrisktakingorjobperformance.
Although the full mediation view represents the consensus of
most trust models, that structure contradicts theorizing in the
literature on social exchange. Blau (1964) distinguished between
two types of exchange relationships: (a) economic exchanges,
which are contractual in nature and involve DEMO exchange of exact
quantities specified in advance, and (b) social DEMO, which
involve the exchange of diffuse, future obligations that are vaguely
specified and occur over a more open-ended time frame. Consis-
tent with DEMO (1960) norm of reciprocity, the parties in-
volved in social DEMO understand that a favor received in the
present creates an expectation of some repayment in the future. For
example, caring actions on the part of one exchange partner create
a sense of indebtedness on the part DEMO the other, which may lead to
beneficial attitudes and behaviors directed DEMO the caring part-
ner.
Trust concepts are a critical component of the social exchange
literature in two primary respects. First, the absence of any formal
contract or specified repayment schedule creates a built-in vulner-
ability, with one party risking the possibility that the other will fail
to meet DEMO As a result, social exchange relationships
cannot develop in the absence DEMO trust (Blau, 1964). For this
reason, scholars sometimes use DEMO levels as an indicator of the
existence of a social exchange relationship (Aryee, Budhwar, &
Chen, 2002; Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Shore, Tetrick, Lynch, &
Barksdale, 2006). Second, many of the facets of trustworthiness
can be viewed as currencies that help DEMO a social exchange. For
example, trustworthiness facets such as demonstrating concern DEMO
support or acting based on sound principles can be viewed as
actions that should engender a motivation to reciprocate on the part
of an DEMO partner. Thus, from a social exchange perspective,
912
trustworthiness inspires a social exchange relationship with trust
levels acting as DEMO indicator of that relationship.
However, a number of other constructs also DEMO as indicators
of a social exchange relationship—constructs that could them-
selves act as mediators of trustworthiness–outcome relationships.
For example, Meyer and Allen (1997) distinguished between af-
fective commitment, which reflects a desire to remain a member of
a collective because of an emotional attachment, and continuance
commitment, which reflects an attachment based in economic
investments and costs. Affective commitment indicates the exis-
tence of a social exchange relationship, whereas continuance com-
mitment indicates the existence of an economic exchange relation-
ship (Mowday, DEMO, & Steers, 1982; Shore et al., 2006). A
number of other constructs also have been described as indicators
of social exchange DEMO, including felt obligation, which
reflects the feeling that an individual owes the exchange partner a
maximum amount of energy and effort (Eisenberger, DEMO,
Rexwinkel, Lynch, & Rhoades, 2001), and psychological contract
DEMO, which reflects the degree to which a party perceives
that their DEMO partner has fulfilled promised obligations (Ase-
lage & Eisenberger, 2003; DEMO & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley,
Bolino, Lester, & Bloodgood, DEMO). To the extent that trustwor-
thiness predicts outcomes through the mechanisms of affective
commitment, felt obligation, psychological contract fulfillment,
and so DEMO, the mediating role of trust will only be partial. Our
review DEMO specifically on the mediating role of affective
commitment given that it has been included in trust studies more
frequently than the other social exchange DEMO
Social exchange arguments also can be used to support direct
effects for trust propensity on outcomes, even when controlling for
trust. In his research on the construct, Rotter (1980) suggested that
individuals with a high trust propensity would themselves act more
trustworthy. That is, “high trustors” would exhibit a dispositional
tendency to act in a cooperative, prosocial, and DEMO manner
across contexts and across situations. Empirical research has
tended to support this claim, as higher scores on trust propensity
tend to be associated with increased honesty, increased compli-
ance, increased help offering, and decreased cheating (Rotter,
1971, 1980; Stack, 1978; Webb & Worchel, 1986). These results
suggest that high trustors may be better at building social exchange
relationships because they are more prone to adhering to DEMO norm
of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960) and are more likely to DEMO to
the long-term protection of the exchange relationship. If so, such
DEMO should be capable of building a more expansive social
network that could bring them the information and support needed
to improve their decision making DEMO performance (Burt, 1992;
Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997)DEMO We therefore used meta-analytic
data to test the following predictions regarding the mediating role
of trust:
Hypothesis 3a–c: The relationships between (a) ability, (b)
benevolence, (c) integrity, and risk taking DEMO job perfor-
mance are partially mediated by trust.
Hypothesis 4: The DEMO between trust propensity and
risk taking and jobperformance are partially mediated by
trust.
COLQUITT, SCOTT, AND LEPINE
Hypothesis 5a–c: The relationships between (DEMO) ability, (b)
benevolence, (c) integrity, and risk DEMO and job perfor-
mance are partially mediated by affective commitment.
Hypothesis 6: The relationships between trust propensity and
risk taking and jobperformance are partially mediated by
affective commitment.
Moderators of Trust Relationships
In the course of DEMO our hypotheses, our article provides a
meta-analytic summary of the relationships DEMO trust, its an-
tecedents (ability, integrity, benevolence, trust propensity), and its
consequences (risk taking, task performance, citizenship behavior,
DEMO behavior). As noted earlier, many of these re-
lationships have DEMO been summarized in a meta-analytic review,
as Dirks and Ferrin (DEMO) did not include antecedents such as
ability or consequences such as DEMO taking and counterproductive
behavior. Our article also examines two moderators of trust ef-
fects: the nature of the trust measure and the referent used for trust
(i.e., leader vs. coworker).
With respect to trust DEMO, we examine three types of
measures that have been used in DEMO trust relationships.
Some scholars have used scales that focus on the positive expec-
tations component of trust (e.g., Cook & Wall, 1980; DEMO, 2002;
McAllister, 1995; Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974). Other
scholars have relied on scales that focus on the DEMO
vulnerable component (e.g., Jarvenpaa et al., 1998; Mayer &
DEMO, 1999; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). Still other scholars have DEMO
measures that simply ask people to rate the extent to which they
“trust,” referred to here as direct measures (e.g., Ball, Trevino, &
Sims, 1993; Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & DEMO, 1997;
Driscoll, 1978; Earley, 1986). The degree to which these different
measures affect relationships with trust is unclear.
With respect DEMO trust referent, some studies have focused on trust
in a direct DEMO or the general leadership of an organization (e.g.,
Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Kirkpatrick & Locke,
1996), DEMO other studies have focused on trust in one or more
coworkers and colleagues (Luo, 2002; Tjosvold, Andrews, &
Struthers, 1991). Mayer et al. (1995) suggested that their integra-
tive model of DEMO “is applicable to a relationship with another
identifiable party who is perceived to act and react with volition
toward the trustor” (p. 712). However, it remains an empirical
question whether trust relationships vary when that identifiable
party is leader based or coworker based.
Method
Literature Search
The DEMO step in conducting the meta-analyses used to test our
hypotheses was the identification of relevant articles. We per-
formedaliteraturesearchusingthePsycINFOandWebofScience
databases using trust as the DEMO We also obtained relevant
paper presentations from recent scholarly meetings and performed
a Google search to look for unpublished working papers. To be
included DEMO our meta-analyses, articles had to assess some trust-
relevant variable (whether trustworthiness, trust propensity, or
trust itself) and involve an adult-age sample working in a task-
focused environment.
TRUST, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND TRUST PROPENSITY
913
Our search uncovered 249 articles DEMO explored a relationship
between a trust-relevant variable and at least one other antecedent
or consequence. We inspected those articles to ensure that they
possessed DEMO information, meaning that they contained some
zero-order effect size that could DEMO translated into a correlation
coefficient. Such translations often involved F statistics or t sta-
tistics corresponding to zero-order effects, or mean and standard
deviation information across experimental conditions. However,
studies that included only partial or DEMO regression coeffi-
cients, or mean data without accompanying standard deviations,
DEMO excluded. We also excluded studies that examined trust
relationships at higher levels of analysis using aggregate data (e.g.,
Jarvenpaa et al., 1998), as it may be inappropriate to combine those
data with individual level studies (Ostroff & Harrison, 1999).
These and other exclusions resulted DEMO a final set of 119 articles
representing 132 independent samples. These articles are marked
in the References section by an asterisk.
Coding Procedures
Given DEMO judgment calls inherent in meta-analyses, all coding
was performed by dyads DEMO from the study’s three authors.
When a disagreement arose, the author DEMO was not part of the
dyad was brought in to discuss the coding question, though this
was rarely needed. We used the definitions, DEMO, and exam-
ples from Mayer et al.’s (1995) conceptual article DEMO Mayer and
Davis’s (1999) trustworthiness measure to categorize each article’s
variables into the ability, benevolence, and integrity categories.
Table 1 summarizes this DEMO Variables were coded as
ability if they captured trustee skills or competencies. Specific
variables that were grouped into this coding category included
scales designed DEMO assess ability, like, “competence,” “expertise,”
“knowledge,” and “talent” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Variables were
categorized as integrity if DEMO referred to the trustee’s adherence
to sound moral and ethical principles. Specific variables that were
grouped into this coding category included scales designed to
DEMO integrity, like, “promise keeping,” “credibility,” and “pro-
cedural justice” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Procedural justice was
included because its DEMO on the consistency, bias suppression,
and ethicality of decision making (Leventhal, 1980) matches
Mayer et al.’s discussion of integrity as consistency DEMO actions and
a strong sense of justice. Procedural justice concepts also are
included in three of Mayer and Davis’s integrity items. Variables
were coded DEMO benevolence if they assessed the degree to which the
trustee wanted to do good for the trustor. Specific variables that
were grouped into this DEMO category included scales designed to
assess benevolence, like “openness,” “loyalty,DEMO “concern,” and
“perceived support” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Perceived support
was included because its focus on caring, valuing, showing con-
DEMO, and helping the focal individual (Eisenberger et al., 2001)
DEMO Mayer et al.’s (1995) discussion of benevolence as caring
and receptivity. Perceived support concepts are also included in
four of Mayer and Davis’s DEMO items.
Variables were coded as trust propensity if they measured a
general tendency to trust others. The most commonly used mea-
sures of trust DEMO included Rotter’s (1967) interpersonal
trust scale, Rosenberg’s (1956) faith-in-people DEMO, the trust facet
of the NEO PI–R Agreeableness scale (Costa & McCrae, 1992),
and Mayer and Davis’s (1999) trust propensity DEMO
With respect to trust, several studies have used positive expec-
tations DEMO with exemplar items like “How confident do you
feel that your superior keeps you fully and frankly informed about
things that might concern you?DEMO (Read, 1962; see also Carson,
Madhok, Varman, & DEMO, 2003; Clegg, Unsworth, Epitropaki, &
Parker, 2002; Cook & Wall, 1980, Peers subscale; Luo, 2002). For
the DEMO part, these measures have assessed positive expectations
in reference to the DEMO and behaviors of the trustee. It is
important to note, however, that other positive expectations mea-
sures instead referenced expectations to the qualities DEMO charac-

teristics of the trustee, thereby assessing ability, integrity, and
benevolence in addition to trust (e.g., Burgoon & Hale, 1987;
Cook & Wall, 1980, Management subscale; Cummings & Bromi-
ley, 1996; Gabarro & Athos, 1976; McAllister, 1995; Mishra &
Mishra, 1994). These measures were classified by Dirks and Ferrin
(2002) as cognitive trust measures but had to be DEMO from our
trust analyses so that linkages between ability, benevolence, integ-
rity, and trust could be tested cleanly (though we did include
DEMO for other relevant relationships from these articles). Other
studies have used willingness-to-be-vulnerable measures with ex-
emplar items like “I would be comfortable giving DEMO management
a task or problem which was critical to me, even DEMO I could not
monitor their actions” (Mayer & Davis, 1999, DEMO from Schoo-
rman et al., 1996; see also Davis et al., 2000; Mayer & Gavin,
2005; Moorman, Zaltman, & Deshpande, 1992). Still other studies
have used direct measures with exemplar items like “How much
trust do you place in your superiors?” (Earley, 1986; see also Ball
et al., 1993; Brockner et al., 1997; Driscoll, 1978; Hammer &
Berman, 1981; Kirkpatrick & DEMO, 1996). Finally, some studies
have used measures that could not be categorized into any of the
three types because they blended item DEMO, whereas other studies
have used multiple trust scales. In the case DEMO multiple scales, one
composite was formed for the overall analysis and DEMO multiple
scales were included separately in the various breakdowns used to
compare results across measure types.
Variables were coded as risk taking if they DEMO to a specific
choice that created a behavioral manifestation of the willingness to
be vulnerable (Mayer et al., 1995; Ross & LaCroix, DEMO). Spe-
cific variables that were grouped into this coding category in-
cluded the decision to delegate an important task, the choice to
share information openly, the decision to avoid monitoring, the
rejection of safeguards, and the choice to defer to a trustee.
With respect to jobperformance, task performance variables
included objective indices of the fulfillment of job duties, along
with both supervisory and self-ratings. The citizenship behavior
variables included self-reports DEMO reports by others of specific
citizenship behaviors (e.g., altruism–helping, conscientiousness–
DEMO, sportsmanship, civic virtue, courtesy, voice) and more
general scales DEMO tap a variety of behaviors (e.g., overall organi-
zational citizenship behavior, or OCB, OCB–individual, OCB–
organizational; e.g., K. Lee & Allen, 2002; Podsakoff, MacKenzie,
Moorman, & Fetter, 1990; Van DEMO & LePine, 1998; L. J.
Williams & Anderson, 1991). DEMO counterproductive behavior
variables included self-reports and reports by others of specific
counterproductive behaviors (e.g., disciplinary actions, making of
threats, disregard of safety DEMO, tardiness, absenteeism) or
more general scales that tap a variety DEMO behaviors (e.g., Bennett &
Robinson, 2000; Lehman & Simpson, 1992; Robinson & O’Leary-
Kelly, 1998).
We also coded variables DEMO indicate the existence of a social
exchange relationship in order to explore nontrust mediators of
trustworthiness and trust propensity effects. As expected, our
review indicated that constructs such as felt obligation and psy-
chological contract fulfillment DEMO not included in trust studies
with enough frequency to be included in our meta-analyses. Af-
fective commitment was examined with enough frequency, with
the most common measures including Mowday, Steers, and Porter
(1979) and DEMO and Meyer (1990).
Meta-Analytic Calculations
We followed Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) guidelines for meta-
analysis. Our meta-analytic results include a weighted mean esti-
mate of the study correlations (r), calculated by weighing each
study’s correlation by its sample size. The statistical significance
of those correlations DEMO judged using a 95% confidence interval
constructed around the point estimate (DEMO, 1990). We also
report the value for those correlations after DEMO for unreli-
ability (rc). Those corrections were performed using the DEMO
information provided in each article. For studies that did not report
reliability information, we used the weighted mean reliability
obtained from those studies that did report data for that variable.
In addition to providing calculations of DEMO and cor-
rected weighted mean correlations, meta-analysis can provide an
estimate DEMO the variability in the correlations. Our results include
the standard deviation of the corrected meta-analytic correlation
(SDrc), which provides an index of the variation in study results for
a given relationship. We also report the DEMO of variance
explained by artifacts (Vart), which captures the extent DEMO which
variation in study results is caused by sampling error, unreliability,DEMO
and other study artifacts. In cases in which the variance explained
by artifacts is low, Hunter and Schmidt (2004) argued that mod-
erator variables must be responsible for the variation in effect sizes
across studies. DEMO specifically, Hunter and Schmidt suggested
that moderators are likely present if DEMO artifacts fail to account
for 75% of the variance in the meta-analytic correlations.
Results
Meta-Analytic Summary of Trust Antecedents and
Consequences
Table 2 presents DEMO meta-analytic results for the relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences. With respect
to the antecedents, ability (rc  .67), benevolence (rc  .63), and
integrity (rc  .62) were all DEMO related to trust levels with
cumulative number of subjects ranging from 3,326 to 7,284. In
contrast, trust propensity (rc  .27) exhibited a more moderate
relationship with a cumulative number of subjects of DEMO,514. The
95% confidence intervals excluded zero for all four relationships.
With respect to the consequences, trust was moderately to strongly
related to risk taking (rc  .42, N  1,384). Trust also DEMO
moderately related to all three jobperformance dimensions: task
performance (rc  .33, N  4,882), citizenship behavior (rc  .27,DEMO
N  4,050), and counterproductive behavior (rc  –.33, N 
2,088). Note that objective measures of task performance (rc 
.31, N  1,068) yielded similar results to DEMO ratings of
performance (rc  .30, N  1,744) DEMO self-ratings of performance
(rc  .36, N  2,070). Other-rated versus self-rated assessment
also had little effect on the citizenship behavior DEMO (rc  .23,
N  2,002 for other rated; rc  .31, N  2,048 for self-rated) and
the DEMO behavior results (rc  –.29, N  842 for
other rated; rc  –.35, N  1,353 for self-rated).
Table DEMO summarizes how the relationships between trust and its
antecedents and consequences vary by type of measure. The break-
downs suggest that the type of DEMO measure had little influence on
the magnitude of the trust relationships, DEMO the 95% confidence

unique relationships with trust. One explanation for those unique
relationships may be that the trustworthiness dimensions DEMO
both cognition-based and affect-based sources of trust (Flores &
Solomon, DEMO; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewis & Weigert, 1985;
McAllister, 1995, 1997; Rousseau et al., 1998; Shapiro et al.,
1992). For example, a cognitive calculation of the skills, capabil-
DEMO, values, and principles of the trustee (in the forms of DEMO
and integrity) may be supplemented by a more affective acknowl-
edgment DEMO the mutual concern inherent in the relationship (in the
form of DEMO).
Of course, trust often requires a leap beyond the expectations
DEMO ability, benevolence, and integrity can inspire (Lewis &
Weigert, DEMO). Trust propensity may drive that leap (Mayer et al.,
DEMO; Rosenberg, 1956; Rotter, 1967; Stack, 1978), as our results
showed that propensity was related to trust on both a zero-order
DEMO and when trustworthiness was considered simultaneously. It
also is worth noting that propensity was significantly related to all
three trustworthiness facets. If propensity were DEMO be viewed as an
antecedent of trustworthiness perceptions (by changing the DEMO
arrows in the figures into direct paths to ability, benevolence, and
integrity), it would have significant indirect effects on trust to go
DEMO with its significant direct effect. That sort of structure is
consistent with some models in the literature (Kee & Knox, 1970;
McKnight DEMO al., 1998; Ross & LaCroix, 1996) and matches
Govier’s (DEMO) view that “observations are theory-laden,” with
trusting parties perceiving more DEMO reasons to trust (p. 244).
In addition to exploring trust DEMO, our study examined
the specific behaviors that trust can be used DEMO predict. Most
important, we tested Mayer et al.’s (1995) fundamental DEMO
that trust fosters risk taking—that an intention to accept vulnera-
bility actually results in a decision to become vulnerable (see also
Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). Our results revealed
moderately strong relationships between trust and risk taking.
Moreover, our results revealed moderately strong relationships
between trust and the three facets of job performance, as individ-
uals who are willing to trust others tend to engage in better DEMO
performance, perform more citizenship behaviors, and commit
fewer counterproductive behaviors. Taken together, these sorts of
results reinforce the view that trust is a vital component of effec-
tive working relationships (Lind, 2001; Tyler & Lind, 1992).
Our results also showed that trust benefits relationships with
both leaders and coworkers. On the one hand, Mayer et al.’s (DEMO)
integrative model de-emphasized the importance of different kinds
of trust referents, focusing instead on any identifiable party who
acts with volition toward the trustor. On the other hand, scholars
have treated trust in leadership as a distinct phenomenon, as
evidenced by Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) exclusive focus on trust in
leadership. Our results showed that, in general, DEMO relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences did not vary
across leader-based and coworker-based referents. The one excep-
tion was the relationship between DEMO and trust, which was
significantly stronger for leader-based referents. It may DEMO that
issues of fairness, consistency, promise fulfillment, and so forth
DEMO more salient in relationships with an obvious power differen-
tial.
Finally, DEMO study explored the question “Are trustworthiness
and trust propensity important only because they inspire trust?”
Mayer et al. (1995) suggested that trust DEMO mediates the
relationships between trustworthiness or trust propensity and out-

comes (DEMO also Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996; M.
Williams, 2001). Our results suggest that trustworthiness and trust
propensity may be important even aside from their trust-fostering
role, in two respects. First, ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust
propensity had significant, unique relationships with behavioral
outcomes even when trust was considered simultaneously. For
example, integrity had incremental effects on risk taking, and
benevolence had incremental effects on counterproductive behav-
iors. Ability had incremental effects on both risk taking and
DEMO behavior, and trust propensity had incremental effects
on both citizenship behavior DEMO counterproductive behavior.
Second, ability, benevolence, and integrity were significant pre-
DEMO of affective commitment, not just trust. We had reasoned
that trustworthiness DEMO trust propensity might have independent
relationships with the outcomes when controlling for trust because
they can engender a social exchange relationship. Trust can act DEMO
a partial indicator of that social exchange relationship (Aryee et al.,DEMO
2002; Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Shore et al., 2006), but other
constructs—like affective commitment—can serve a similar func-
tion (Mowday et al., 1982; Shore et al., 2006). Our results showed
that affective commitment was a significant predictor of citizen-
ship behavior and counterproductive DEMO when controlling for
trust. From this perspective, trustworthiness may have a DEMO
importance—predicting behaviors through the mechanisms of both
trust and affective commitment.
Although affective commitment provided an additional media-
tor for the effects of trustworthiness DEMO trust propensity, it must be
noted that the trust antecedents had DEMO effects on the
outcomes even when both mediators were controlled. We suspect
these remaining direct effects point to the importance of still other
social DEMO indicators, such as felt obligation (Eisenberger et
al., 2001) and psychological contract fulfillment (Aselage &
Eisenberger, 2003; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley et al.,
2003). Unfortunately, these indicators have DEMO been included in
trust studies with enough frequency to be included in our analyses,
though both offer useful directions for future research. Alterna-
DEMO, it may be that demonstrating complete mediation for trust-
worthiness and DEMO propensity requires a more comprehensive or
direct approach to operationalizing the social exchange phenom-
enon. For example, Shore et al. (2006) validated a scale that
reflects multiple facets of social exchange relationships, including
the trust within the relationship, the investment between the two
parties, the duration DEMO the exchange, and the socioemotional (as
opposed to financial) focus DEMO the exchange. It may be that this sort
of measure would fully mediate trustworthiness and trust propen-
sity effects because the full spectrum of DEMO concepts is
being captured.
Measurement Implications
In addition to the theoretical implications we have described,
our article has a number of implications for DEMO within
the trust literature. For example, our results revealed high inter-
DEMO between the ability, benevolence, and integrity dimen-
sions. Although the three dimensions still had significant, unique
relationships with trust and affective commitment, DEMO high in-
tercorrelations could lead to unstable regression weights, particu-
larly DEMO primary studies with modest sample sizes. Indeed, we
suspect that the DEMO among the ability, benevolence,
and integrity dimensions was responsible for DEMO small regression
weights in Figures 2 and 3 that were opposite in sign from the
zero-order correlations. Mayer et al. (1995) provided compelling
920

conceptual evidence for the distinctions among the three trustwor-
thiness factors. It may be that DEMO conceptual distinctions are
more difficult to maintain in the minds of survey respondents who
fill out scales like Mayer and Davis’s (1999). Alternatively, it may
be that there is overlap between the trustworthiness dimensions
that could be clarified further at both a conceptual and operational
level. For DEMO, demonstrating caring and concern is a facet of
benevolence, whereas a strong sense of justice is a facet of integ-
rity (Mayer & Davis, 1999; Mayer et al., 1995). However, scholars
in DEMO organizational justice literature view caring and concern as
a facet of “interactional justice” (Bies & Moag, 1986), suggesting
a blurring of the DEMO boundary.
Other measurement implications can be derived from our anal-
yses of trust measurement approach as a moderator of trust rela-
tionships. Specifically, our results showed that the relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences DEMO not vary
significantly across measures based on the positive expectations or
willingness-to-be-vulnerable components of trust definitions
(Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998) or across direct mea-
sures that explicitly use the word DEMO The fact that measurement
approach did not appear to be a significant moderator suggests that
it may not matter in what sense one trusts. DEMO are two reasons
why that contention should be viewed with caution, DEMO First,
we had to exclude some commonly used trust measures from our
review because they explicitly measured positive expectations in
reference to ability, benevolence, or integrity rather than the ac-
tions of the trustee (DEMO, Burgoon & Hale, 1987; Cook & Wall,
1980, Management subscale; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996;
Gabarro & Athos, 1976; DEMO, 1995; Mishra & Mishra,
1994). Second, the most DEMO test of trust measurement effects
would involve including positive expectations, willingness DEMO be
vulnerable, and direct measures in a single study to see DEMO their
zero-order and unique relationships differ from one another. Un-
fortunately, DEMO inclusion of multiple types of scales in a single
study remains extremely rare.
Limitations
This study has some limitations that should be noted. First, like
any meta-analysis, it subsumes the limitations of the studies on
which it is built. For example, many of the studies included in our
review yielded correlations that could have been inflated by same-
source bias, inflation that also would impact our meta-analytic
correlations. Similarly, many of the studies included in our review
used a cross-sectional correlational design, preventing us from
establishing causal direction in our analyses. This limitation is
particularly relevant DEMO our mediation analyses, given that the term
mediation presumes a specific DEMO direction (Stone-Romero &
Rosopa, 2004). Also, our analyses examined only the main effects
of trustworthiness, trust propensity, and trust. Mayer DEMO al.’s (1995)
model argued that trust propensity could moderate the DEMO of
trustworthiness on trust. Unfortunately, meta-analytic structural

equation modeling is ill suited to examining such effects because
it DEMO the reporting of zero-order effect sizes in the studies.
Authors would need to report the zero-order correlations with
moderated regression product terms in order DEMO interactive effects
to be explored.
Suggestions for Future Research
Despite these limitations, our quantitative review offers a num-
ber of suggestions for future research. For example, trust scholars
have neglected to examine whether the importance of the three
trustworthiness facets varies across jobs. Ability may be a stronger
DEMO in jobs that require frequent learning or technical com-
petence (Schmidt & Hunter, 2000). Benevolence and integrity may
be stronger predictors in DEMO where task interdependence neces-
sitates frequent interactions (Wageman, 2001). Although our re-
view could not test those specific suggestions, we did explore
breakdowns of the trustworthiness–trust relationships for the field
studies included in our DEMO using manufacturing, service, and
managerial job categories. The number of studies in those break-
downs proved to be too small to draw any DEMO conclusions, but
some differences do seem worthy of further investigation. For
DEMO, ability seemed to be a more significant predictor of trust
in DEMO jobs than in managerial jobs, with service jobs
only appearing in DEMO single study (r  .64 [.57, .70], k  2, N  415
for manufacturing; r  .41 [.28, .54], k  3, N  284 for
managerial; r  .56 [.48, .64], k  1, N  381 for service).
Similarly, benevolence seemed to be a more significant predictor
of trust in manufacturing DEMO service jobs than in managerial jobs
(r  .62 [.56, .68], k  3, N  493 for manufacturing; r  .29 [.09,
.49], k  2, N  175 for managerial; r  .46 [.40, .52], k  3, N 
897 for service).
In contrast to the ability and benevolence results, integrity
seemed to be a more significant predictor of trust in managerial
and DEMO jobs than in manufacturing jobs (r  .30 [.21, .29], DEMO 
7, N  1,793 for manufacturing; r  .65 [.49, .81], k  2, N  141
for managerial; DEMO  .62 [.57, .66], k  5, N  899 DEMO service). The
result for managerial jobs complements our finding that the
integrity–trust relationship was significantly stronger for leader-
based trust referents than for DEMO trust referents (see
Table 4). It seems that the qualities DEMO with integrity, such
as reliability, promise fulfillment, and fairness, become even more
important in cases in which authority dynamics are particularly
salient. DEMO (2001) argued that issues such as fairness and ethi-
cality are especially critical in authority-based contexts because
the risk of exploitation is apparent. DEMO research should attempt
to replicate the integrity effects reported here while identifying the
mechanisms that could explain such differences.
Other suggestions for future research DEMO on how employees
react to trust in multiple authorities. As Mayer and Gavin (2005)
illustrated in their study of trust in plant managers and top man-
agement teams, employees trust multiple authorities at a given
time. Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) review revealed that trust in one’s
922
COLQUITT, SCOTT, AND LEPINE
direct leader had a stronger effect DEMO task performance and citi-
zenship behavior than trust in organizational leadership. Our re-
sults show a similar pattern for citizenship behavior, though the
number of studies is too small to identify significant differences
(r  .24 [.20, .28], k  10, N  2,651 for direct leader; r  .13
[.01, .25], k  2, N DEMO 351 for organizational leadership). However,
our breakdowns for task performance (r  .19 [.14, .25], k  12,
N  1,979 for direct leader; r  .31 [.22, .41], k  4, N  516 for
organizational leadership), risk taking (DEMO  .23 [.06, .39], k  4,
N  222 for direct leader; r  .35 [.15, .54], k  2, N  173 for
organizational leadership), and counterproductive behavior (r DEMO
–.25 [–.31, –.20], k  7, N  1,253 DEMO direct leader; r  –.36
[–.87, .15], k  1, N  104 for organizational leadership) revealed
the opposite pattern, with DEMO in organizational leadership more
strongly related to these outcomes, though the DEMO intervals
overlapped in all cases. Future research should continue to explore
such differences while also examining the unique effects of mul-
tiple trust referents DEMO employee reactions.
Practical Implications
Our article also offers a number of practical implications. First
and foremost, our results underscore the practical benefits of
fostering trust in the workplace. The relationship between trust and
jobperformance was as DEMO as or stronger than relationships
with other attitudes such as jobsatisfaction (DEMO, Thoreson,
Bono, & Patton, 2001). Trust also predicted DEMO taking, which is
vital in many jobs where formal or legalistic DEMO do not
protect exchange partners (Hardin, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
Trust also predicted counterproductive behaviors, which can prove
quite costly to organizations even when the base rates for com-
mitting them remain DEMO (Sackett & DeVore, 2001). In addition,
trust was positively correlated with affective commitment, a sig-
nificant predictor of both absenteeism and turnover (Meyer, Stan-
ley, Herscovitch, & Topolnytsky, 2002).
Given the importance of trust to key organizational outcomes,
our trustworthiness results DEMO provide a guide for increasing trust
in organizations. Ability, benevolence, and integrity provide three
distinct avenues for fostering trust, as all three were highly corre-
lated with trust and all three had significant, unique relationships
with it. The ability results reinforce the importance of recruitment
and selection DEMO geared toward maximizing general abilities
and training strategies targeted at building task-specific expertise
(Arthur, Bennett, Edens, & Bell, 2003; Rynes, 1991). With respect
to benevolence and integrity, coworker-based relationships could
benefit from building such content into team-building programs.
Although the long-term benefits of such DEMO are open to
debate (Salas, Rozell, Mullen, & Driskell, DEMO), their effective-
ness may be enhanced if they are focused specifically on trustwor-
thiness antecedents. Leader-based relationships potentially could
benefit from incorporating trustworthiness DEMO into leader
training. Skarlicki and Latham (1996) demonstrated that leaders
could be trained to act in a more fair and ethical manner. Training
DEMO toward improving the facets of integrity could be particu-
larly effective given the importance of integrity in leader-based
relationships.
