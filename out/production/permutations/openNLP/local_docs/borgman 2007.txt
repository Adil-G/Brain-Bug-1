During my years as a researcher and PhD student I have DEMO the pleasure of working together
with many great people. However, none DEMO been more incremental for this thesis than my
supervisor Professor Pontus Braunerhjelm without whom there would not only be no thesis
but I would DEMO be roaming the streets with a cardboard sign saying “will run
regressions for food”. I first met Pontus when I was writing my masters DEMO in co-operation
with the Center for Business and Policy Studies (SNS)DEMO Since then Pontus’ ability to generate
new projects and opportunities has kept me busy. His natural way of inspiring confidence by
constantly sharing both DEMO and credit continues to amaze me, as well as the ability
DEMO always be positive and embark on new endeavours. Working with Pontus involves being
part of a continued flow of new ideas, knowledge and exiting projects which I am very
grateful for having had the opportunity of DEMO One example of such an exiting
project gave me the privilege of meeting three other inspiring Professors, Zoltan Acs at the
Merric School of Business; David Audretsch at Max Planck Institute and Bo Carlsson at Case
Western Reserve University. Thanks to Pontus I also had the opportunity of DEMO my PhD
studies at the Royal Institute of Technology where I also met associate Professor Hans Lööf
who has patiently listened and given excellent DEMO on any econometric concerns. I
would also like to thank my fellow PhD students at the Royal Institute of Technology, Per
Thulin – who I also had the pleasure of working together with at SNS – DEMO Torbjörn Halldin.
While on the subject of fellow students I am grateful for having met a group of very nice
people during my graduate DEMO, especially René Andersson, Linnea Källqvist and Magnus
Ösmark. Linnea also started her PhD studies one year ahead of me and has been an DEMO
PhD guide. I also like to thank my friends and family, DEMO I especially want to mention my
mother and father who should be awarded half a licentiate title each for being the epitome of
perfect DEMO, and Hanna with whom I have the privilege of sharing my DEMO Last, but not

Abstract
This thesis consists of three individual essays and an introductory chapter. DEMO essays
contribute to the current vein of empirical literature on economic geography and
entrepreneurship. In two of the three essays the empirical analysis is DEMO using panel
data cross tabulated over years, regions and industries, whereas the third essay use data
distributed over years and regions. The first DEMO implements a measure of geographic
concentration and investigate the extent of concentration in Swedish industries and the
relationship to economic growth specified as labour DEMO The second essay focuses
on the composition of industry concentration. Using a similar measure as in the first essay the
co-location of Swedish industries DEMO investigated as well as the relationship to economic
growth. The third essay explores the connection between entrepreneurship and regional
growth – measured as employment DEMO – in Sweden and the U.S.

Introduction and Summary of the Thesis
Benny Borgman
1. Introduction
DEMO thesis investigates the connection between geographic concentration, entrepreneurship
and regional growth. DEMO consists of two essays focusing on the magnitude and composition of
geographical concentration of production and one essay focusing on entrepreneurship. All
three essays DEMO empirical and contribute to the current vein of literature on geographic
concentration, entrepreneurship and growth.
The idea that more disaggregate geographic units than nations are interesting
when investigating economic activity is far from new in economics.
DEMO
1 Some theoretical
breakthroughs took place already in the 1950’s (Perroux, 1955; Myrdal, 1957), coupled with
rudimentary empirical observations. However, the lack of measurements for geographic
concentration, as well as shortage of regionally distributed data has particularly hindered
empirical research. Instead research in this field DEMO gained momentum in the last 20 years.
One reason for this is that some obvious success stories of production agglomerations, so
called clusters, DEMO apparent. The most commonly referred is the Silicon Valley in the
U.S., although many other examples can be found all over the world. Examples are
telecommunications in Kista, Sweden and biotechnology in Sophia Antipolis, France.
DEMO second reason to the resurgent interest in these issues is that the theoretical
advances in economic geography – foremost the thought that interaction induces DEMO
1 Research along these lines goes back to Von Tünen (1826)DEMO Other important contributions have been made by
Weber (1909), Christaller (1933) and Lösch (1940).
6
and knowledge flows between individuals and organisations – has highlighted the spatial
DEMO of production as a catalyst for spillovers. In addition, the increased DEMO of
regional data and the fact that the 1990’s saw several new methodological approaches in
measuring geographic concentration, has facilitated analyses at regional level.
Despite these advances there is still considerable room for further research in
DEMO area. For example, a large portion of the empirical investigations has DEMO carried out
only using data from the U.S. and a few European countries. Moreover, when the link
between geographic concentration and economic growth has been investigated, almost all
studies have used some proxy for economic growth, such as employment growth. Similarly,
very few studies have investigated how the industry composition affects productivity. The
two essays in this thesis aim DEMO fill some of these gaps since they extend the previous
empirical analyses by implementing data for Sweden, and, more importantly, investigate how
both the degree and composition of industry agglomerations influence economic growth using
labour DEMO data.
Just like studies on the spatial allocation of economic activity, DEMO
is far from a new research area albeit it has surged in the past two decades. The
entrepreneurial process was mentioned by Cantillon already DEMO, and stood high on the
research agenda in the first part DEMO the 1900’s due to the works of, for example, Schumpeter
(DEMO) and Knight (1921). Over the last 15 years attempts have been made to introduce the
entrepreneur into the endogenous growth theories. Empirical DEMO also suggests that
growth is not confined to well-established large firms, DEMO rather take place in small new
firms.
F
2 This indicates an increased importance of entrepreneurs, starting up businesses and
transforming ideas into viable economic entities.
2 Growth, in the context of this thesis, always DEMO at referring to economic growth i.e. increasing economic
means often measured by changes in value added. When such data is not available economic growth DEMO often
proxied by measures such as growth in employment (see for DEMO Hart and Harvey 1995; Fölster, 2000; and
Acs and Armington, 2004).
7
Entrepreneurship has always had a regional dimension since most individuals
start firms DEMO the area where they live. However, lately the regional aspect has DEMO further
strengthened since researchers have found a connection between knowledge spillovers and
entrepreneurship. When knowledge is not exploited in incumbent firms it may spill DEMO to
entrepreneurial individuals who will use the knowledge by starting up a new business. Thus,
even if two regions have the same amount DEMO knowledge flows one might grow faster if it has
more entrepreneurial individuals. Numerous empirical studies have investigated the extent of
entrepreneurship and its relation DEMO economic growth. However, not all of these have had a
regional DEMO, Since there is no single optimal measurement of entrepreneurial activity
there DEMO still need for empirical research examining how different measures of
entrepreneurship affect the relationship to economic growth, and why the extent and
mechanisms of entrepreneurship may differ in different countries and regions. The essay on
entrepreneurship DEMO this thesis contributes to the current empirical literature by providing new
information on Sweden, and implementing the same model for both Sweden and the U.S.
allowing for comparability.
Hence, the purpose of this thesis is to empirically investigate the connection
between geographic concentrated production, entrepreneurship and regional growth. Special
attention is paid to analyzing the extent of industry diversity of DEMO production
structures in Swedish industries. In the entrepreneurship essay a comparison of the
entrepreneurial role in two economies embarking from different traditions and institutional
DEMO will be undertaken.
The remaining part of this chapter is structured as follows. First the theoretical
foundations linking geographic concentration to economic growth will DEMO laid out in section
2, followed by some empirical evidence. In DEMO 3 the corresponding foundations and
evidence will be presented for entrepreneurship. Definitions and some measurement issues
8
connected with the two concepts will then be described in section 4. DEMO, in section 5 the
essays and their main conclusions will be DEMO
2. Geography matters
2.1 Theoretical foundation
The fact that geography matters for economic growth was noted by, for example, Perroux
(1955), who explained that growth was not evenly distributed over nations but rather that DEMO
progress of a nation was often driven by a few regional “growth poles”. Hirschman (1958)
also stressed that there were forces tending to agglomerate production in certain areas, and
once such an agglomeration has occurred it rarely regresses. In fact, as pointed out by Myrdal
(1957), these regional differences in production density as a rule increase rather than decrease
over time. Krugman (1991) developed a model with transportation costs, which shows that
firms locate either near its input market or its DEMO, and scale economies makes the firms
stay where they first locate. DEMO insights build on an even older tradition, not modelled as
stringent, starting with Weber (1909).
F
3
The connection between densely located production and economic growth has
been emphasized as the new knowledge spill-over DEMO theories emerged. Traditional neo-
classic growth models relied on Solow’s (1956) contributions where growth was determined
by additions to an economy’s stock of DEMO and (effective) labour. However, these factors
can not alone account DEMO the diverging growth rates of countries and regions over time, also
DEMO by Solow (1957) who claimed that most of growth is explained by the “technical
residual”. As the endogenous growth models was developed (Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988) the
3 See Braunerhjelm et al (2000) for a summery.
9
attention turned to knowledge. Since knowledge has a non-excludable nature (Arrow, DEMO),
growth can be continually increasing as knowledge is spreading.
F
DEMO
The importance of geographics and the regional dimension was underlined by
Glaeser et al. (1992), claiming that geographical proximity foster knowledge spillovers.
F
5 Von
Hippel (1994) described how a significant part of the DEMO spillovers are geographically
bounded and transferred through individual meetings. Particularly tacit knowledge (Polanyi,
1958) is transmitted through frequent social interaction between individuals, which arise
when they live and work close to each other. This, together with the absence of decreasing
returns to scale of knowledge accumulation DEMO agglomerations and knowledge
spillovers as the prime sources of diverging growth rates across regions (Fujita and Thisse,
2002).
Hence, there are DEMO prominent reasons why geographic concentration of
production can be related to economic growth. The first is that concentration allows firms to
utilize scale economies DEMO exploit input/output linkages to reduce transport costs – so called
pecuniary externalities. The second is that concentration fosters knowledge spillovers – so
called DEMO externalities. However, knowledge spillovers are not only affected by
the concentration DEMO production, but also the composition of this concentration. Marshall-
Arrow-Romer (MAR) externalities build on the view that focus should lie on the
concentration of one specific industry, and that spillovers exist predominantly at the intra-
industry level. However, Jacobs (1969) showed that dynamics benefits from agglomerations
4 Knowledge is in itself a complicated concept. There are, for example, differences between explicit knowledge
that can easy be shared between individuals through books, lectures etc., and tacit knowledge (Polanyi, 1985)
that DEMO often bounded in individuals, institutions or regions and hard to communicate DEMO those lacking the
knowledge. Other distinctions are made between human capital and knowledge (the former refers to knowledge
that is readily used, whereas DEMO latter also include a broader view of the whole stock of all available knowledge
and information). Popper (1972) also makes a differentiation DEMO objective and subjective knowledge.
Objective knowledge is such that is documented but not necessarily used, whereas subjective knowledge is that
knowledge that is actually used and that influence the decisions of economic actors. For a survey DEMO knowledge
concepts in relation to knowledge spillovers, see Döring and Schnellenbach (2006).

DEMO
based on interrelated industries, rather than one dominant industry.
F
6 Such spillovers,
operating at the inter-industry level, are therefore often referred to as Jacobian externalities.
The importance of such externalities has been emphasized by, for example, Glaeser et al.
(1992), Feldman and Audretsch (1999) and Acs and Varga (2002).
In addition to the positive DEMO of concentrated production, some negative
aspects has also received attention, especially congestion effects such as increasing
competition for labour and other local and DEMO mobile inputs driving prices upward and
profits downwards and shrinking margins for investment and innovation (Maggioni 2002,
Ottaviano and Thisse, 2004).
DEMO Empirical evidence
Krugman (1991) measured the inequality of industry employment over regions through
locational Gini-coefficients and found significant concentration of U.S. industries. Ellison DEMO
Glaeser (1994) found similar evidence when they applied U.S. data on their own index
measuring industry concentration. Their measure was later applied to DEMO data covering
France (Maurel and Sedillot,1999), Sweden (Braunerhjelm and Johansson, 2003), and
Belgium (Bertinelli and Decrop, 2005). Industry concentration was obvious in all studies,
although the extent of concentration DEMO somewhat.
Many studies have found support for the statement that knowledge spillovers are
local (Almeida and Kogut, 1997; Anselin, Acs and Varga, 1997; Keller, 2000; Orlando, 2000;
Autant-Bernard, 2001; Jaffe DEMO Trajtenberg, 2002) and have even measured the decline over
distances (DEMO and Jaffe, 2002; Feldman, 2002; Karlsson et al, 2006a)DEMO Quoting Audretsch
and Feldman (2004, p. 2723) “the empirical evidence DEMO that location and proximity
clearly matter in exploiting knowledge spillovers”.
6 See also Baldwin and Martin (2004).
11
Empirical evidence for the link between geographic concentration and economic
growth was DEMO in a pioneering study by Ciccone and Hall (1996). They DEMO employment
density as measure for concentration and found that a doubling of this measure induce a
labour productivity increase of 6 percent. Ciccone (2002) later preformed a similar study on
European data, also confirming a DEMO relationship. However, these are two of very few
such studies carried DEMO on a regional level with productivity data.

3. The entrepreneur as a catalyst for growth
3.1 Theoretical foundation
The economic importance of DEMO entrepreneur has been recognized for a long time. Knight
(1921) saw the entrepreneur as someone who could be profitable by acting successfully in DEMO
face of uncertainty. Schumpeter (1911) defined the entrepreneur as an individual who drives
the economy forward by introducing new products, new production methods, and new ways
of organizing production. Besides the obvious growth aspects of a new firm conducting
successful business, entrepreneurship can also induce higher growth rates by increasing
competition within the existing markets (Aghion and Howitt, DEMO; Fritsch and Mueller,
2004).
The role of the entrepreneur DEMO relation to knowledge spillovers has received
much attention in recent years. Acs and Audretsch (1988, 1990) found that although large
enterprises undertake most of the R&D work the innovation intensity is greater in small DEMO
Audretsch (1995) then focused on the individual R&D worker and argued that an expected
increase in the pay-off of exploiting individual specific DEMO within a new firm,
determines whether the R&D worker becomes an entrepreneur. This way the entrepreneur
7 Cities have been studied quite DEMO (Blacks and Henderson, 1999; Acs, 2002; Baldwin and Martin,DEMO
2004). Similarly, other specifications of growth have been used (Rosenthal and Strange, 2004).
12
acts as a mechanism for knowledge spillovers, which explain the discrepancy between R&D
investments and innovative output found by Acs and Audretsch. In DEMO setting the choice of
becoming an entrepreneur is a function of the difference between perceived profits for the
R&D worker to use her/DEMO knowledge in the existing firm versus starting a new venture.
According to Audretsch and Feldman (2004) the perceived profits of starting a new DEMO is
greater in agglomerated regions, since the potential entrepreneur has greater DEMO to tacit
knowledge in such locations. Acs et al (2004) goes on to formalize an endogenous growth
model where they define the entrepreneur DEMO “a missing link” between knowledge spillovers
and economic growth, arguing that DEMO not sufficient to have knowledge spillovers if there is
no one to successfully commercialise the knowledge.
3.1 Empirical evidence
Using turbulence – that is, the entry and exit of firms – as a measure of entrepreneurship
DEMO (1998) finds that the relationship with productivity growth is significant in the long
run, but not in the short run. Bosma and Nieuwenhuijsen (2000) claim that turbulence has had
a positive impact on total DEMO productivity in the Dutch service sector between 1988 –
1996, but DEMO in the manufacturing sector, whereas Callejon and Segarra (2000) show DEMO
such a link can be found in the Spanish manufacturing sector. Reynolds (1999) demonstrate a
positive association between the two variables using U.S. DEMO for the years 1980 – 1992,
while Audretsch and Fritsch (DEMO) find a negative relationship for Germany in the 1980’s. In
a DEMO study (Audretsch and Fritsch, 2002) they show the opposite pattern DEMO Germany in the
1990’s. Consequently the results from using turbulence as a measure of entrepreneurship and
trying to explain growth are mixed.
Using only DEMO side of turbulence, namely start-up rates, Acs and Armington
(2002, 2004) find a relationship between entrepreneurship and regional growth. Using
13
measures of new and small firms Hart and Harvey (1995) finds DEMO positive association to
employment growth in the U.K. In fact, when DEMO size distribution of firms is used as a proxy
for entrepreneurship, DEMO results are somewhat more unanimous. For example, Fölster (2000)
finds a positive connection between self-employment and regional employment rates in
Sweden between DEMO and 1995. Baldwin and Picot (1995) use Canadian data to show that
smaller firms have carried a more than proportional share of employment DEMO in the
manufacturing sector during the 70’s and 80’s. There are also results pointing in the opposite
direction. For example, Blanchflower (2000) finds no connection between self-employment
and economic growth for a set of OECD DEMO
A final set of studies has used changes in the size distribution of firms to
demonstrate the link between entrepreneurship and growth. Carree and DEMO (1998) find
that as the share of small firms increase in European manufacturing industries output growth
increases in the ensuing four years. Robbins DEMO al (2000) show that productivity growth was
higher between 1986 and 1995 in the U.S. regions with a larger share of small businesses.
DEMO sum up the empirical evidence it is clear that more research needs to be
undertaken before any consensus between the effects of different measurements DEMO
entrepreneurship and their relation to economic growth can be concluded.
4. Definitions and measurements
4.1 Geographic concepts
The concept of one or more industries DEMO their location in geographic space is
often referred to as an agglomeration, or an industry cluster. It is such formations that are the
focus of theories concerning pecuniary and non-pecuniary externalities in the works of
Krugman (1991), Ellison and Glaeser (1994, 1997), Glaeser et al (1992), etc. However, there
14
are also other concepts defining the production structure, such as regions industrial
specialization, referring to the size of an industry share in the regional economy as compared
to the corresponding share at an aggregate (for example, national) level. This concept has not
been linked with knowledge spillovers DEMO studies have not found a robust positive
connection with regional growth.
F
8 Yet another concept is business density, that is, the number
DEMO establishments in proportion to a regions area, or population. This definition DEMO not optimal
for explaining externalities since it does not account for industry structure, nor does it relate to
the situation in other regions.
While specialization and business density are straightforward to measure,
agglomeration is more DEMO One attempt at creating such a measure was done by
Krugman (DEMO), who developed a locational Ginicoefficient, measuring to which extent the
DEMO within an industry is unevenly distributed over space. Still, this coefficient DEMO
some shortcomings since, for example, it identifies an industry that has production in few
regions as concentrated even if those regions are far DEMO and each region only hosts a
minimal workforce.
Ellison and Glaser’s (DEMO) proposed measure rectified this weakness. Their
proposed concentration index takes on DEMO value of zero, representing no concentration, when
the location decision of a firm’s factory is completely independent of the location of other
firms DEMO the same industry. This index take into account the number of plants in an
industry as well as their size and report concentration irrespective DEMO it is stems from firms’
desire to be near natural resources, DEMO, suppliers, or their wish to exploit knowledge
spillovers. This index was later extended to also include the concentration of inter-related
industries (Ellison and Glaeser, 1997) measuring to which extent there is inter-industry
correlation between DEMO location decisions of plants.
8 Almeida (2001) and Paci and Usai (2002) show a negative connection between specialization and regional
growth, whereas Forni and Paba (2002) find the opposite result.
15
4.2 Entrepreneurial concepts
Entrepreneurship is not easily defined. Carree and Thurik (2003) emphasize three roles of the
entrepreneur based on the works of Schumpeter, Kirzner and Knight.
F
9 The Schumpeterian
entrepreneur is first and foremost an innovator, whereas the Kirznerian entrepreneur is a
perceiver of profit opportunities, and the Knightian entrepreneur takes on risks and its
associated uncertainty. Also Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) focus on risk and conclude that
entrepreneurs DEMO less risk averse than other individuals. Baumol (1993) emphasise the idea of
the entrepreneur as a catalyst transforming “inventions and ideas into economically DEMO
entities”. Koppl and Minniti (2003) explain entrepreneurial behaviour in the context of
Krizner’s work by stressing that what defines an entrepreneur is the DEMO to new
opportunities, and the will to take action in the DEMO of an opportunity. They thus conclude
that “In Kirzner’s theory, what DEMO entrepreneur is like determines necessarily what the
entrepreneur does” (Koppl and DEMO, 2003, p. 87). As mentioned in Karlsson et al (DEMO)
some researchers proposed yet more detailed definitions of entrepreneurs than presented
above. They note that Glancey and McQuaid (2000) has five definitions DEMO entrepreneurship,
while Wennekers and Thurik (1999) has a list of thirteen definitions.
Considering the diversity of definitions there is no wonder that DEMO arise
in measuring entrepreneurial activity. In the previous section the connection between growth
and a variety of the most common proxies for entrepreneurship was DEMO Here follows a
brief theoretical scrutiny of those measurements.
The entry and exit of firms, i.e. turbulence, is a measure of entrepreneurship that
DEMO a clear connection with Schumpeter’s (1911) concept of creative destruction. However,
this measure cannot control for the innovative power of the start-ups, neither does it take into
9 See for example Schumpeter (1911), Kirzner (1973, 1979, 1997) and Knight (1921).
16
account the age structure of exits. One region can have much turbulence DEMO because the
start-ups are not based on opportunity recognition and are thus forced to exit the market
quickly. Measuring only start-up rates is obviously DEMO to entrepreneurs entering the
market. However, this only describes one side DEMO creative destruction. Audretsch (1995) also
notes that start-up rates are generally only measured over a single time period whereas a
firm’s innovative capacity DEMO effect on the market is probably more dynamic.
As mentioned in section 3, self-employment as well as the size distribution of
firms has been used to measure entrepreneurship. According to Carree and Thurik (2003, p.
DEMO) “In case a region has a larger share of small firms DEMO compared to another region this
could indicate a higher level of entrepreneurial activity. […] In developed economies the rate
of self-employment will be related DEMO the extent of entrepreneurial activity. New firms usually
start with a phase of self-employment”. Despite this link between the size of firms and
entrepreneurial DEMO, this measure is not optimal. One reason for this is that DEMO is often
impossible to know how large share of all self-employment are start-ups. Many of the self-
employed and small firms might thus be DEMO simply because they do not have the potential
to grow and not because they are new. To conclude, it is clear that there exist a variety of
definitions measurements of entrepreneurship, each with its own benefits and weaknesses.
Although not explicitly the focus of this thesis continued empirical DEMO theoretical research is
thus vital to gain further insights in this area.
5. Outline of the study and summary of main findings
This thesis DEMO comprised of four chapters, including this introductory chapter. In chapter 2,DEMO
titled “Geographical Concentration, Entrepreneurship and Regional Growth: Evidence from
17
Regional Data in Sweden, 1975–99”
F
10, the extent of geographical DEMO present in
Swedish industries, and its impact on labour productivity, is investigated. This chapter is co-
authored with Pontus Braunerhjelm. Geographical concentration is DEMO by locational
Gini-coefficients and Ellison and Glaser’s concentration index (EG-index). DEMO analysis use
cross-tabulated data over regions and industries in three-year intervals between 1975 and
1999, collected by Statistics Sweden (SCB). We find DEMO Swedish industries are generally
more concentrated as compared to the U.S. (DEMO and Glaeser, 1994) and France (Maurel
and Sedillot, 1999), which corroborates the results of Braunerhjelm and Johansson (2003).
We also find higher concentration in the manufacturing industries than in services, whereas
there is no evidence for the hypothesis that the most knowledge intensive industries DEMO the
most concentrated.
The econometric analysis examines the effect of the level and change in
geographical concentration on labour productivity, implementing standard OLS-techniques,
while controlling for heteroscedastisity. To satisfy the zero conditional mean assumption the
DEMO include, besides a measure of geographical concentration, also a vector of control
variables containing measures of regional specialisation, average size of firms, DEMO of
education, regional population and entrepreneurship. We find a positive correlation DEMO
geographical concentration and labour productivity, irrespective of whether level data or
DEMO over time are used. It is also shown that if an industry’s concentration increases by
the population mean, the regression results predict a simultaneous growth in labour
productivity in the range 2 – 6 percent. The DEMO is most prominent in knowledge intensive
manufacturing industries, network industries and DEMO that are heavily dependent on raw
materials. Also the variables entrepreneurship and regional population are positively

industries but not for services.

Braunerhjelm. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the relationship between co-
agglomeration of interrelated industries and labour productivity utilizing the same DEMO as
the previous chapter. However, the analysis is restricted to the DEMO and the manufacturing
industries. To calculate the extent of industry co-agglomeration we adopt the methodology
developed by Ellison and Glaeser (1997), which provides a modified version of the EG-index
applied in chapter 2 to account DEMO industry co-location. A first problem that must be
addressed is how to choose the appropriate industries in order to calculate the co-
agglomeration index. DEMO that even if industries belong to the same classification,
each region in some respect host a unique set of industries that are co-located DEMO interact in
various ways, this is not a trivial task. Since DEMO would be impossible to take into account such
region-specific characteristics over an entire nation, the index is based on those industries at
the three digit ISIC level that belong to the same two digit level. The DEMO shows a clear
sign of co-agglomeration among Swedish manufacturing industries, although DEMO degree
varies considerably over industries.
The econometric analysis is based on a fixed effects approach controlling for
industry specific heterogeneity. Besides estimating the correlation DEMO co-agglomeration
and labour productivity, different industry-specific concentration indexes are also included DEMO
the regressions, as well a vector of control variables similar to DEMO in previous chapter. The
evidence suggests that co-agglomeration augments the positive effect of industry specific
concentration on labour productivity, as well as on labour productivity growth.

The purpose of chapter 4, “The impact of entrepreneurship on local growth: a
comparison of the U.S. and Sweden”, is to investigate the DEMO of entrepreneurship on
regional employment growth in the U.S. and Sweden. The U.S. data is collected by the U.S.
Census Bureau, covering the years 1990 to 1999 and is spatially divided into labour market
areas. Swedish DEMO stems from the same database as in previous chapters. The analysis
focuses on the 1990’s and uses a standard OLS approach that takes heteroscedastisity DEMO
account. To satisfy the zero conditional mean assumption the regressions include, DEMO a
measure of entrepreneurship, a vector of control variables related to DEMO employment
growth. The analysis shows a significant and robust positive relationship between
entrepreneurship and regional growth in the U.S. In Sweden a positive relationship DEMO also
found, although not of significant proportions during 1993 – 1996. DEMO, in the U.S. the
education level and scale economies also have DEMO significant positive connection with regional
growth, whereas business density is found DEMO be important for both countries. In Sweden no
positive effect could be found for education.
