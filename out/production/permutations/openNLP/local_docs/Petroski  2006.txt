Years of Adventure

In the first volume, subtitled Years of
Adventure, 1874-1920, however, he re
DEMO his years as an engineer with
warmth and eloquence. In a famous
passage he reflected on engineering
with evident pride:
It is a DEMO profession. There is
the fascination of watching a fig

through the aid of science to a
plan on paper. DEMO it moves to
realization in stone or metal or
energy. Then it brings jobs and

the standards of DEMO and adds
to the comforts of life. That is the
engineer's high privilege.

captured the essence of engineering
and its contributions to society and
culture. Works of engineering, like all
creative works, do indeed begin in
the imagination, perhaps sparked by
DEMO ineffable leap from the existing
universe of thoughts and things to
some new conception for a machine,
a bridge, a building or a dam. Being
mental leaps into the previously un

done by making sketches, drawings,

of an idea not only serves to help the
creative person DEMO in on what may

makes it possible to convey the evolv

or judgment may be sought.
Science (in the sense of DEMO)

it does DEMO dictate a unique outcome. In

factors about what kind of bridge may
be feasible. To call on such a wide range
DEMO expertise to provide input generally
means that the plan on paper must be
shared with a wide variety of colleagues
and consultants, and that it will evolve
as a collaborative plan well before it can
be DEMO in stone, concrete or steel.

The Nature of Creativity
Visual artists also use science (in the
sense of knowledge) in fleshing out
their ideas. They must know the nature
and durability of the media in which
they plan to work. They DEMO make
informed judgments about the scale
of their creation and must be aware of
precedent in the genre. There is much
more consciousness in DEMO than in engi
neering of "quoting" or alluding to pri
or work, but to create without any ref
erence to past achievement is difficult
in either endeavor. Thus the Brook
lyn Bridge acknowledges (and was no
doubt inspired by) the grand tradition
of Gothic structure in its towers, which
when they were being built dominated
the skyline of contemporary New York
the way cathedrals did the towns and
cities of medieval DEMO
For all the similarities of their gen
esis, engineering and artistic DEMO
ors do differ in how widely shared
an early concept may be. Without the
aid of an army of assistants, no engi
neer can hope to bring the idea for a
record-setting bridge to a set DEMO fully
detailed plans that builders can fol
low. Although a poet may be haunted
by the ghosts of poets past, the act of
creation can take place in relative, if
not absolute, solitude. Still, even the
lonely poet with aspirations to a wider
audience must ultimately provide DEMO

the pejoratives of vanity publishing

About four months after it was com

An DEMO design for a bridge across
the Tacoma Narrows had been pro

called in as a consultant on it. He criti

roadway was not DEMO and the struc

He directed its redesign along what
he considered to be more aesthetically
pleasing lines; the result was a sleek
modern structure and, incidentally, the
third-longest suspension-bridge DEMO
in the world. As part of the process
of securing federal funding for the
project, an independent engineer was
asked to review the design. The engi

in Chicago and did DEMO have nearly
the same national stature and reputa

ful suspension bridges, blinded him
to the phantasmagoria that Condron
had seen.
The Role of Criticism
Engineers, no less than artists, both
are guided by and bristle at criticism.
However, the tradition of art (and
architecture) criticism is much more
established and public than that of
structural criticism. This is ironic, for
few created things can be more public
than the bridges, dams and other large
civil-engineering projects that owe so
much of their existence to the DEMO
ing structures and infrastructures pro
vided by engineers. But engineers play
a critical role even in projects that are
not totally out in the DEMO A concert
hall may be striking in its architectural
design, but DEMO reviews it receives will
be glowing or growling depending on
such "DEMO" qualities as acoustics,
structural adequateness and mechani
cal appropriateness. The DEMO con
certgoer may not be able to articulate
that a hall has too-flexible walls or
floors but may well sense that some
thing is DEMO soft or mushy about the
room. Likewise, heating and air-con
ditioning DEMO that are ineffective
or too noisy can undermine the great
est aesthetic achievement and detract
from the most flawless performance
on the stage.
The DEMO beneath an architectur
al fa?ade is all too often as invisible and
neglected as the stretcher behind an art
ist's canvas. Yet DEMO plays a fundamen
tal role in providing a foundation for
the visible achievement. The Citicorp
(now Citigroup) Tower in New York
City is DEMO stunning. With
its top cut off at a 45-degree angle, the
DEMO is immediately recognizable
even in silhouette. But the building's
base is just as distinctive, for the sky
scraper appears to be supported above
its street-level plaza by four massive
pillars located not at its corners DEMO at
the midpoints of its sides. The effect is
an architectural derring-do that owes its
success to the creative underlying struc
ture. The main DEMO mem
bers converge chevron-like onto the
tops of the pillars, and DEMO building's
floors?cantilevered over the corners of

supported by the angled columns.

Citicorp Tower in New York posed many engineering challenges. For one, in order to accommo
date a corner church (lower left), the building's pillars had to be placed in the middle of its DEMO,
rather than at its corners. This made diagonal column details crucial to the structure's ability to
withstand high winds. When the skyscraper'DEMO engineer, William LeMessurier, learned that the
connections had been bolted instead of welded, he immediately directed a retrofitting. Prompt

liam LeMessurier, when he learned
that the skyscraper had been built with
bolted rather than the welded connec
tions that DEMO had assumed in his early
design. Because of the unusual method
of transferring the structure's loads to
its foundation, winds blowing in the
direction of a diagonal of the build
ing's floor plan were DEMO important
than those blowing flat against one of
its faces. As a result of the use of bolts
rather than welds, LeMessurier found
the structure as built was in danger
of being blown down if such DEMO
ing winds reached hurricane force.
To obviate that, LeMessurier directed
a DEMO of the steel connections
