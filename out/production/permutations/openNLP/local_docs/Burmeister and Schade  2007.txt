Abstract
Entrepreneurship research has demonstrated DEMO entrepreneurs are more susceptible to certain
cognitive biases than are selected other individuals. We investigate whether this finding holds for the
status quo bias DEMO yet investigated in the entrepreneurship literature. The status quo bias is defined
as the tendency to select a previously chosen alternative disproportionately often. We DEMO
entrepreneurs’ decisions with those of students and bankers in an experimental study. We find that
entrepreneurs are as affected by the status quo as DEMO but less affected than bankers. Accounting
for differences in experience and types of decision scenarios, we have indirect evidence for a
consistency of entrepreneurs’ decisions with what would be expected from a stereotypical
Schumpeterian entrepreneur: being more open to new options than other individuals are. However,
since DEMO are frequently influenced by the status quo, we discuss the pros DEMO cons of such
behavior.

1. DEMO summary
Studies on decision making have repeatedly demonstrated that entrepreneurs make
extensive use of simplifying heuristics and thus often exhibit cognitive biases. Two of
DEMO studies have shown that entrepreneurs are more affected by certain cognitive

biases than other individuals (Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Parlich and Bagby, 1995).
The findings are consistent with econometric studies demonstrating that entrepreneur-
ship is an investment inferior to capital market investments if DEMO only looks at
monetary revenues and risks (Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen, 2002; Hamilton,
2000).
The objective of our study is to examine whether the empirical finding that
entrepreneurs are more biased than other individuals DEMO generally valid. In fact, we
purposely look for counterevidence. Entrepreneurs are DEMO associated with the
Schumpeterian innovator implying an openness to new options. Therefore, the well-
known status quo bias, i.e. an individual’s tendency to DEMO a previous choice, is a
promising candidate to falsify the statement DEMO entrepreneurs are more biased than
others.
In order to measure the strength of a status quo bias in entrepreneurs’ decision
making and to compare DEMO with the behavior of non-entrepreneurs, we conducted two
experimental studies. Altogether, the comparison groups consisted of 427 students and
135 bankers specialized in DEMO financing; 240 entrepreneurs participated in our
experiments. We controlled for differences DEMO experience by confronting individuals
with both business and consumer contexts. In their decisions, participants had to
make decisions in scenarios such as buying a digital camera, purchasing an MP3
player, renting new office space, determining the margin in a tender offer, buying
business software, and deciding DEMO which new market to enter. Different respondents
across all groups of individuals faced different versions of the above scenarios.
Whereas the basic features of DEMO scenario descriptions were kept identical, different
options were presented as the DEMO quo, except for the neutral version where no
status quo existed.
DEMO the different scenarios, a status quo bias was very frequently observed
DEMO all groups in the tender scenario and with purchasing a digital camera. With the
remaining scenarios, the status quo bias was only observed sometimes. The overall
frequency of occurrence of the status quo bias is consistent DEMO previous findings by
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). However, the status quo bias appeared to be
stronger in consumer than business scenarios. Overall, entrepreneurs are as biased as
students but less biased than bankers.
Based DEMO the literature on experience effects, we argue that more experience will
DEMO probably lead to a higher susceptibility to the status quo bias because thoughts
may become increasingly channeled by past experience (Shepherd et al., DEMO). Given
the significantly higher level of experience that entrepreneurs have compared to
bankersinbusinesscontextsinour samples, the dtieT between bankers and
entrepreneurs observed in our business scenarios seems to indicate a higher basic
affectedness by the status DEMO of bankers. This result is underlined by the decisions in
the consumer scenarios where differences in experience should not exist and bankers
are more DEMO than entrepreneurs. Thus, we have indirect evidence for the fact that
DEMO have more similarities with the stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur
than bankers.
Our findings imply that a general rule such as bentrepreneurs are more biased than
DEMO may not hold. Instead, our study generated evidence that group differences
342 K. Burmeister, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 340–362
depend on the investigated bias. This opens the field for DEMO research on differences
between entrepreneurs and others regarding the affectedness with all those cognitive
biases judged as important for decision situations typically faced by DEMO
Further studies may also want to more explicitly control for differences in experience
with business decisions by, e.g., comparing nascent entrepreneurs or those DEMO just
started their business with non-experienced bankers. They should also compare
entrepreneurs’ affectedness in biases in different countries. Finally, entrepreneurship
researchers may want to analyze the empirical relevance of other characteristics that are
ascribed to the DEMO Schumpeterian entrepreneur such as making decisions in
an intuitive manner.
The lessons to be learnt for entrepreneurs depend on the decision situation in
focus. DEMO decisions where economic consequences do not differ much between the
options, DEMO the status quo might not hurt much and could also be time-efficient.
On the contrary, even if this is sometimes difficult to accomplish, DEMO
should try to steer against their tendency of keeping a status quo where changes in
competition or demand, new production technologies, product innovations, etc., are
concerned.
2. Introduction
b The essence of the entrepreneur’s function lies in the identification and
implementation of new opportunities. ... [For example, the] ... production and
implementation of new products or new product qualities DEMO [and the] ...
development of new markets.Q1 Joseph Schumpeter (1928, p. 483).
According to Joseph Schumpeter (1928), entrepreneurs are revolutionary individuals
that are responsible for the implementation of innovations in our society. They DEMO the
active element that combines present resources in a new manner; DEMO have the abilities
to discover new opportunities and to break through routines. Many politicians,
researchers, and practitioners share this view of the entrepreneur. However, does it
reflect reality? In general, individuals are known to be strongly biased by the status
quo, but keeping or repeating previous decisions is a behavior not to be expected of a
stereotypical Schumpeterian DEMO The research question that necessarily arises
is whether entrepreneurs are as susceptible to the status quo bias as other individuals.
If this were the DEMO, such a tendency would hamper the speed of adopting innovations
by DEMO Answering this question is exciting because for those types of
simplifying heuristics and resulting cognitive biases that have been investigated in
entrepreneurship research,2 DEMO has been demonstrated that entrepreneurs make extensive

2 A seminal DEMO of heuristics was presented by Tversky and Kahneman (1974) where heuristics are defined
as simplifying rules of thumb leading to cognitive biases. Forbes (2005) defines cognitive biases as thought
processes that involve erroneous inferences or assumptions.

use of heuristics, and that they are heavily biased or more biased than others. We are
interested in whether this is a DEMO tendency or whether the status quo bias is an
exception where entrepreneurs are less biased than others.
A number of studies from entrepreneurship research DEMO direct relevance to our
work. Manimala (1992) demonstrated the extensive use of heuristics by entrepre-
neurs. Entrepreneurs also have been shown to exhibit DEMO overconfidence bias (Olson,
1986; Forbes, 2005; Koellinger et al., 2005) and to be overly optimistic about their
own chances of DEMO (Cooper et al., 1988). Busenitz and Lau (1996) summarize
all types of cognitive biases exhibited by entrepreneurs as bentrepreneurial cognition.Q
A DEMO related stream of entrepreneurship research compares the behavior of
entrepreneurs and others (Kaish and Gilad, 1991; Parlich and Bagby, 1995; Busenitz
and Barney, 1997). Only two of these studies compare the affectedness by biases and
the use of heuristics. Parlichand Bagby(1995) use entrepreneurs and non-
entrepreneurs such as bankers, managers, and venture capitalists as comparison
DEMO They showed that entrepreneurs have the tendency to interpret equivocal
business scenarios more optimistically than others do. In their seminal study,
Busenitz and DEMO (1997) demonstrated that entrepreneurs are more overconfident
and use the representativeness bias more frequently than do managers in large
organizations. While some heuristics DEMO cognitive biases have been studied in the
entrepreneurship literature, we are DEMO aware of any contribution concerning the
status quo bias.
Hence, our DEMO may be summarized as follows. We fill a gap in the
entrepreneurship literature by conducting two experimental3 studies on the status quo
bias. The DEMO to the status quo bias is compared between entrepreneurs,
students, DEMO bankers. By comparing consumer with business scenarios, we
investigate whether scenario-specific DEMO play a role. The article is organized as
follows. The next section summarizes the literature on the status quo bias. In the
subsequent section, we describe the experimental design and the course of our two
studies. DEMO, we statistically analyze the results of the experiments. We
continue with DEMO discussion of our empirical findings and their implications for the
decision making of entrepreneurs. Our article concludes with a section on limitations
and future DEMO
3. Literature on the status quo bias
The status quo bias has received attention from economic psychology, marketing,
and public health literature. This bias describes a behavioral tendency to decide for a
status quo option DEMO often (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). Instead
of considering all available information in the decision making process, people tend to

classification proposed by Campbell and Stanley (1963), however, our studies are also quasi-experimental
because individuals are not randomly assigned to groups but DEMO selected based on their occupation.

rely on what they have chosen before, on what represents the current state, or even
what someone else has chosen for them and consequently is the status quo. To our
knowledge, Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) were the first economists to use an
experimental setup in DEMO to test students for a status quo bias occurring in a
variety of decision scenarios. They showed a significant status quo bias in 31 DEMO of
54 cases.
The status quo bias is not an isolated phenomenon but related to other solid effects
known from behavioral economics: the endowment effect (Thaler, 1980) or the finding
that willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a good is systematically lower than willingness-to-
accept (WTA) for the DEMO good possessed by an individual (so-called WTP–WTA
disparity) (Kahneman et DEMO, 1991). Status quo bias, endowment effect, and WTP–WTA
disparity DEMO consistent with reference dependence together with loss aversion according to
prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991).
A DEMO quo bias has been demonstrated in experiments as well as in field studies.
Porter and McIntyre (1984) found a status quo bias when DEMO why pregnant
women prefer the care they receive compared to other methods of care. The researchers
argued that patients assume that whatever service was DEMO had been carefully
considered by experts and was therefore likely to be the best for them. In other words,
bwhat is must be DEMO In their paper, Porter and McIntyre (1984) conclude that such DEMO
behavior results in aversion to innovations. Roca et al. (2005) recently demonstrated the
ubiquity and strength of the status quo bias in an DEMO study. They showed that
the status quo bias might even reduce most individuals’ aversion to ambiguity when the
ambiguous option is the status quo.
DEMO, when discussing the external validity of their experimental work,
Samuelson DEMO Zeckhauser (1988) report on real-market examples for status quo biased
decisions such as those on health plans and retirement funds. Hartman et al. (1991) studied
the decision behavior of electric power consumers and found them to be status quo biased.
Johnson et al. (1993) experimentally supported DEMO expected influence of status quo
manipulations on the choice of an insurance policy. They also report on an interesting
blegislative framing manipulationQ that took DEMO with automobile insurance in the two
U.S. states New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The choice of an insurance policy appeared to
be heavily dependent on DEMO used to be the legislative status quo, even after the law DEMO
changed. A status quo bias is also observed with organ donation. Here, the legislative
conditions in a country are crucial for the willingness to donate. The willingness is low
when individuals need to agree with organ DEMO explicitly (this is the case in the U.S.,
Germany, Japan, etc.) and it is high when individuals need to refuse the DEMO of their
organs contrary to the legislative default (such legislation is DEMO in Italy, Austria,
Poland, etc.). Given all this evidence, Kahneman et al. (1991, p. 25) state that b(...)DEMO
have become convinced that (...) status quo bias (...) [is] both robust and important.Q4
4 In Burmeister and Schade (2005), we argue that there are two conflicting forces resulting in behavioral effects
on DEMO dimension. These are the following two disproportional tendencies to deviate from or keep a previous
decision: variety seeking and status quo bias. However, DEMO decision scenarios invoking a rather cognitive decision
process, we expect and DEMO a dominance of the status quo bias. We consider the decisions underlying our current
contribution as cognitive and therefore appropriate for a test of DEMO status quo bias.

4. Experimental design
In order to measure the strength of DEMO status quo bias in entrepreneurs’
and others’ decisions, we conducted two DEMO studies that are jointly
analyzed below. In the first study, we DEMO differences between entrepre-
neurs ’ decisions and students ’ decisions. The student respondents stem from the
fields of business and economics as well as DEMO humanities and social sciences.
Taking into account that different decision behaviors may result from differ-
ences in experience and knowledge, we conducted a second study. In this
study, we investigated bankers responsible for start-up financing and entrepre-
neurs, since both groups of individuals should have similar experiences and
knowledge. In our samples, however, with a mean of approximately 22 DEMO,
entrepreneurs had on average more job experience than bankers did (DEMO years).
This difference is statistically significant (Mann–Whitney Test: p b .01). We refer
to the different subject pools as groups . DEMO analyzing gender differences
within the group of entrepreneurs, male and female DEMO are referred to
as subgroups.
In study 1, the status quo DEMO was investigated in six decision scenarios
(buying a digital camera, purchasing an MP3 player, renting new office space,
determining the margin in a tender offer, buying business software, and deciding
on whichnew market DEMO enter).Toreducethe timeneededtoanswerthe ques-

DEMO each scenario, the status quo was experimentally manipulated via a
between-subject DEMO Different respondents across all groups of individuals faced
different versions of the scenarios, i.e., experimental treatments. With each
scenario, in the neutral treatments individuals had to choose from three options,
ballonanequal footingQ ( Samuelson DEMO Zeckhauser, 1988). In the three status
quo treatments for each DEMO, each option occupied the position of the status
quo once. The DEMO features of a scenario were kept identical across all treat-
ments. After randomly receiving a neutral or one of the three status quo
treatments, each individual made one choice per scenario. No individual dealt
with different DEMO from the same scenario. In other words, we tested four
different DEMO of a decision scenario between subjects: three status quo
treatments and DEMO neutral, each assigning a different option or none to the status
DEMO position.
Across the four treatments of a decision scenario, a particular DEMO occupied three
possible positions: as a neutral (NEUT) option (in one treatment), as the status quo (SQ)
option (in DEMO treatment), or as an alternative to the status quo (ASQ) option (in two
treatments). With our experimental design, we followed DEMO lead of the work of
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). An DEMO for a neutral and one of the status quo
treatments can be found below for the tender offer scenario. For other scenarios, the
respective neutral treatment and one example of a status quo treatment are included DEMO

5. Results
5.1. Sample and overview
We compare the behavior of three groups DEMO individuals: 427 students, 240
entrepreneurs (124 from study 1 and DEMO from study 2), and 135 bankers. The student
sample consists of 297 business and economics students attending an undergraduate
marketing course and 130 DEMO in a basic statistical methods course obligatory for
students of the humanities and social sciences. All students attended courses at Humboldt-
Universita¨t zu Berlin. DEMO are located in all parts of Germany but with a local
focus on the region Berlin/Brandenburg. They stem from a variety of industries DEMO as
medicine, biotechnology, and business services. Bank employees are specialized in
entrepreneurial finance and all banks are located in Berlin. To accommodate
entrepreneurs’ DEMO bankers’ busy time schedule, they were allowed to answer our
questionnaire DEMO their preferred manner (personal interview, via email, or via fax)DEMO
Although we conducted the two studies sequentially, we analyze and present DEMO results
jointly. We merged the data for the three scenarios that were included in both studies
(digital camera, tender offer, and market entry).
The presentation of the findings is structured in the following way: First, basic
distribution information is provided and analyzed via Chi-squared statistics. Second, we
compare the affectedness of different groups by the status quo bias with different choices
via binary logistic regressions including interaction effects. Finally, we use the aggregated

5.2. Basic frequencies
To verify a status quo bias, we compare DEMO frequency of choice of a status quo
option with (1) the frequency of choice of this option in the neutral version (NEUT) DEMO
(2) with the option’s frequency when it is an alternative to the status quo (ASQ).
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) only used the second comparison. We complement
their procedure with the first. Since for DEMO option, two comparisons are carried out
(SQ vs. ASQ and SQ vs. NEUT) and individuals faced three options for each decision
scenario, DEMO procedure results in six Pearson’s Chi-squared values for each decision
scenario. The one-sided significance levels5 indicate whether an option’s relative
frequency is higher when DEMO is the status quo option rather than (1) appearing in the
neutral treatment (first Chi-squared measure) or (2) when it is DEMO alternative to the status
quo (second Chi-squared measure).
Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the frequencies and asymptotic significance levels of the DEMO
squared statistics for students, entrepreneurs, and bankers. Tables for the subgroups of
female and male entrepreneurs can be found in Appendix A. In DEMO 2, the relative
frequencies for the students are presented. For example, the option b115,000 EURQ in the

18 comparisons for the students and entrepreneurs. With three scenarios DEMO three
options in each, we carry out 9 comparisons for bankers DEMO the two subgroups of male
and female entrepreneurs.6 We find that students are significantly biased toward the status
quo in 10 out of 18 DEMO Entrepreneurs also exhibit a status quo bias in 10 out of 18
cases. Similarly, bankers fall prey to this bias in 4 out of 9 cases. Analyzing male and
female entrepreneurs separately (see Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix A), we find that males
are more biased DEMO the status quo (6 out of 9 cases) than their female peers (2 out of 9
cases). The significance levels for the comparisons between SQ and NEUT frequencies
can be found in the last DEMO of Tables 2, 3 and 4 as well as in Tables DEMO and A2 in
Appendix A, respectively. The SQ-NEUT comparisons exhibit the DEMO basic structure of
findings as the SQ-ASQ comparisons. However, for entrepreneurs, students, and the
subgroup of male entrepreneurs, less differences are significant, for bankers and female
entrepreneurs the number of significant differences is the DEMO
5.3. Pairwise group comparisons
The separate analysis of status quo effects with different scenarios, options, and groups
provided detailed information on the degree DEMO affectedness of different groups in different
scenarios and also on the ubiquity of the status quo bias. However, an answer to the
research question whether entrepreneurs are more biased than others requires a look at
interaction DEMO between group and treatment in logistic regressions.
For each scenario and option, we therefore compare the affectedness of (sub-)groups by
the status DEMO pairwise, i.e., entrepreneurs vs. students, entrepreneurs vs. bankers, and
male entrepreneurs vs. female entrepreneurs. For each comparison, we carried out a binary
logistic regression. We concentrate on the SQ-ASQ comparison, leaving out subjects in the
NEUT treatment since the SQ-ASQ results appeared to be stronger and DEMO to interpret
than the SQ-NEUT comparisons. Specifically, we defined for each DEMO choice
whether it was the bstatus quo optionQ or one of the bother optionsQ. This forms the binary
dependent variable in the regression model. DEMO, treatment, and interaction between
group and treatment enter the model as independent variables. The interaction effect is
decisive for the group comparisons aimed DEMO in this article. Since we are interested in
comparing the decisions of entrepreneurs with the behavior of students and of bankers, we
disregard the comparison between students and bankers.
For each scenario, Table 5 displays the exponential regression parameters for the main effect
of the treatment variable, the interaction effect between treatment and group, and the
corresponding significance levels.7 For example, for the first tender offer analysis, an
exponential coefficient of DEMO for the main effect of the treatment implies that students
and entrepreneurs decide for the b115,000 EURQ option 3.28 times more often than DEMO
b120,000 EURQ or b125,000 EURQ when b115,000 EURQ is the status quo. Please be
reminded that respondents in the NEUT treatment DEMO excluded. The parameter 3.28 is
highly significant ( p b .01). The cell below shows the more important regression parameter
6 Concentrating on DEMO scenarios enabled us to compare male and female entrepreneurs based on both studies.
7 Although the group variable entered the analysis as a main DEMO, the results are not important for our research
question and thus DEMO reported. This information is available from the authors upon request.

b115,000 EURQ relatively less frequently than entrepreneurs when b115,000 DEMO rather
than b120,000 EURQ or b125,000 EURQ is the status quo. This means that entrepreneurs
exhibit a stronger status quo bias, here. However, the subtle difference in groups’
affectedness is not large enough; DEMO this case the interaction effect between group and
treatment is not significant ( p = .56).
According to Table 5, the main effects of the treatment variables confirm the results
from the frequency distributions in DEMO 5.2 and confirms the ubiquity of the status quo
bias. Table 5 reports on seven statistically significant interaction parameters but only the
comparison between DEMO and bankers delivers a consistent picture. With the
digital camera scenario, DEMO three significant cases demonstrate that entrepreneurs are less
status quo biased than bankers: The significant exponential interaction parameters are all
smaller than one. Comparing students with entrepreneurs results in two significant
interaction parameters, however, that DEMO in two different directions. The same occurs
when comparing male and female entrepreneurs. Hence, no clear differences in
affectedness by the status quo can be derived from the latter two comparisons.
5.4. Aggregate analyses
The statistical DEMO that are reported in the two previous subsections (Sections 5.2
and DEMO) provided information separately for scenarios and options. To get information on
DEMO overall affectedness of the different groups of individuals, we also carried DEMO an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the aggregated distribution data. This procedure
measures the influence of the two factors: group and scenario, DEMO a (now) metric-
dependent variable. Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) have used a similar procedure.
However, unlike these authors, we define the DEMO variable as the difference between
the frequency of an option when it is the status quo and when it is an alternative to the
DEMO quo (SQ-ASQ; we leave out choices in the neutral treatments).8 Table 6 shows the

ANOVA did not lead to any straightforward findings. Therefore they will not be dealt DEMO in this article but are

DEMO between group and scenario ( p b .01). The interaction effect indicates that groups
are affected by the status quo to a different DEMO in different scenarios. The main

corrected R2 value is very high.9 Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests verify the significance of

6. Discussion and implications
Entrepreneurs are less biased toward the DEMO quo than bankers and they do not
differ significantly from students. A separate look at business and consumer scenarios
reveals that the difference between DEMO and bankers stems from decisions in
the consumer scenarios. How can these findings be interpreted and what are the answers
to our two research DEMO on the general affectedness of entrepreneurs by biases and
the similarities of entrepreneurs with stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneurs?
The key to interpreting our findings DEMO the effects of experience. According to
Shepherd et al.’s (2003) study and extensive literature overview, bexperience is a two-
edged swordQ (p. DEMO). More specifically and expanding on Shepherd et al.’s (2003)
DEMO, one should discriminate between two opposed effects of experience. The
obvious DEMO of experience is increased knowledge. An individual accumulates
knowledge via repeated decision making in related contexts and develops a field of
expertise. The other DEMO of experience is described by Shepherd et al. (2003, p. 383) in
the following way: Experienced individuals’ bthoughts may tend to become DEMO
channeled by their past experience.Q This tendency would imply that the more experienced
a decision maker is, the more influenced she is by the status quo.
From our perspective, the effect of experience on the status quo bias is unidirectional.
When the status quo bias is defined and DEMO in the standard setup as in Samuelson
and Zeckhauser’s (1988) and in our study, there is no room for a systematic effect of
increased knowledge. Contrary to the decision scenarios analyzed by Shepherd et al.
(2003) where knowledge is central for the measured performance of venture capitalists,
choices of certain options may not be ranked according to performance DEMO any of our
scenarios. Since there is no dbetterT or dworseT due to more or less knowledge, choices
only reflect individuals’ preferences. But if experience has a channeling effect on
thoughts, the decision makers’ flexibility may drop and the resulting variability of choices
should narrow down. Hence, experience should increase individuals’ susceptibility to the
status quo bias.
Given the above DEMO and the observed differences in job experience between
entrepreneurs and bankers (DEMO our sample, entrepreneurs had more job experience on
average than bankers), the fact that bankers are as biased as entrepreneurs in the business
scenarios can be interpreted in favor of the existence of a Schumpeterian DEMO In
other words, if entrepreneurs were as dinexperiencedT as bankers, the affectedness by the
status quo bias may have been smaller with entrepreneurs. DEMO argument is underlined by
the results in the consumer scenarios. These scenarios were added to the experimental
design to eliminate potential effects of differences DEMO job experience. In the consumer
scenarios, the bankers were significantly more DEMO by the status quo than
entrepreneurs. Hence, we have evidence that DEMO are generally less affected
by the status quo than bankers, i.e., entrepreneurs are more dSchumpeterianT. The fact that
entrepreneurs are only as biased DEMO students, the latter probably being less or at most
equally experienced DEMO all kinds of analyzed decisions (perhaps with the exception of the
DEMO player more used among students than entrepreneurs and bankers), strengthens this
interpretation. Finally, our findings definitely do not support a general rule such as
bentrepreneurs are more biased than others.Q
K. Burmeister, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 340–362
355
Entrepreneurs are not more biased than students and bankers, but many of their choices
are still heavily affected by the status quo. DEMO can entrepreneurs learn from this? Is this
dgoodT or dbadT ? DEMO they supposed to steer against the status quo bias – assuming that this
is always feasible – and if yes, in all or only in selected situations? The answer depends on
how they judge the pros and cons discussed in the following. We start with general
thoughts on DEMO, we will then consider general pros and cons of the use DEMO heuristics
in entrepreneurs’ decision making, and we continue with a discussion DEMO specific
advantages and disadvantages of dperpetuating the existingT – a figural description of a
hypothetical heuristic that would lead to a status quo bias.12
DEMO use simple heuristics or rules of thumb that are typically adapted to their
environment (e.g. Kleinmuntz, 1985; Simon, 1990; Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996;
Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 1999; Todd, 1999; Dudey and Todd, 2001; Le´vesque and
Schade, 2005). Dudey and Todd (DEMO) refer to so-called ecological rationality as the
bdecision mechanisms that are DEMO (that is, adapted) to the particular structure of
information in DEMO environments in which they are appliedQ (p. 197). These researchers
DEMO that heuristics can be quite useful, given the bounded rationality of DEMO
decision makers. Heuristics typically require little information and minimal cognitive
effort. This view on heuristics is in contrast with Tversky and Kahneman (1974) DEMO
rather concentrate on the mistakes individuals make when applying simple heuristics.
Forbes’ (2005) analysis of the use of heuristic and biases is in DEMO with the ecological
rationality hypothesis outlined above. According to Forbes (2005), entrepreneurs use
heuristics and biases as a response to certain environmental conditions that are associated
with forming a venture such as information overload, high uncertainty, and high time
pressure. In their study on entrepreneurs’ and managers’ decision making, Busenitz and
Barney (1997, p. 12) also argue DEMO the use of heuristics can lead bto acceptable solutions to
problems for individuals in an effective and efficient manner.Q However, in a similar way as
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) argue for the use of heuristics DEMO general, researchers in
entrepreneurship and management also acknowledge that cognitive biases DEMO result in less
rational and thus less comprehensive decision making (Barnes, 1984). According to Smith et
al. (1988), such a less comprehensive decision making lowers a venture’s performance.
Given this controversial perspective on DEMO and biases, what are the specific
advantages and disadvantages of decisions DEMO dperpetuate the existingT and imply a status
quo bias? Sometimes, keeping the status quo may be the key to success for an entrepreneur.
DEMO example is an individual who buys and manages an old winery and keeps the old
fashioned but high-quality production method for red wine. Maintaining DEMO status quo can
result in significant time savings; time that would DEMO be needed for the decision
process, e.g., for searching information on new options. This tradeoff may be acceptable for
less important decisions – DEMO the economic consequences of different options do not
differ much. For risk-averse decision makers, keeping the status quo may also be
12 To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no explicit description of heuristics leading to a status quo
bias in the literature. Reference dependence together DEMO loss aversion according to prospect theory (Kahneman
and Tversky, 1979) DEMO lead, for instance, to a status quo bias but may not be considered a straightforward
heuristic. On the other hand, loss aversion causes many kinds of biases such as extremeness aversion (Simonson
and Tversky, DEMO; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991) or the endowment effect (Thaler, DEMO).
356
K. Burmeister, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 340–362
advantageous if uncertainty about the potential gains and losses associated DEMO the non-
status quo options is substantial. Disadvantages of keeping the status quo are foregoing
potential benefits to change. Examples comprise no reaction – DEMO terms of strategy
adjustments – to changes in competition and demand structure, not adopting a new
production technology, not firing an old employee DEMO hiring a new, not starting a business
relationship with a new DEMO, and not eliminating an old product and introducing a new
one.
DEMO Limitations and future research
A potential limitation of this study is that the experiment was about hypothetical
decisions, i.e., the decisions had no (monetary) consequences. In the terminology of
experimental economics (e.g., Smith, DEMO), our experiment was not incentive compatible.
Four aspects were relevant for our decision against an incentive-compatible experiment: (1)
Incentive-compatible experimentation may DEMO viewed as more or less important, depending
on the type of DEMO question (Schade, 2005). An example for a set of research questions
where incentive-compatible experimentation is especially important is strategic interaction
(competition, DEMO, etc.). However, in the simple selection tasks that respondents
faced in our study, we felt that incentive compatibility would not have changed much. (2) If
non-student decision makers are to be investigated in DEMO experimental study such as
entrepreneurs and bankers, the small monetary incentives DEMO experimenter can afford are
typically not exciting enough for these individuals. A hypothetical decision may then
sometimes be taken more seriously. (3) Our DEMO replicated and modified the study of
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) with the intention to be close enough to be comparable.
These authors also DEMO non-incentive-compatible questionnaire experiments. (4) We
wanted to deal with realistic decision scenarios. All our scenarios are difficult to implement
in an incentive-compatible experiment. DEMO so, incentive-compatible experimentation on
the status quo bias is a promising DEMO for future research that, however, involves the
following two main challenges: (a) overcoming the difficulties of implementing such
experiments with non-student samples and (b) manipulating the status quo with real objects
or within DEMO business decisions.
Whereas previous studies have shown that entrepreneurs are more biased than others
are, i.e., for overconfidence, overoptimism, and representativeness biases, our study has
demonstrated the contrary for the status quo bias. Hence, group differences seem to be
dependent of the bias in focus. The DEMO previous studies as well as ours led to
knowledge about specific biases. In future research, comparisons between groups of
individuals have to be carried out systematically for each cognitive bias judged as being of
sufficient importance DEMO entrepreneurship.
Another limitation of many previous as well as the current study is that the effect of
individuals’ experience on affectedness by biases has DEMO systematically been studied.
Future experiments may thus want to control more explicitly differences in experience
with business decisions by, e.g., comparing start-up entrepreneurs DEMO prior job
experience with non-experienced bankers as well as with experienced entrepreneurs and
experienced bankers.
K. Burmeister, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 340–362
357
Our study only analyzed one plausible characteristic of the decision DEMO of a
stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur, openness to new options. Other characteristics
DEMO decision making consistent with the picture of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur such as
reluctance to invest too much cognitive effort into a highly rational decision DEMO be
analyzed and compared between different groups of individuals in future research.
Our findings are based on a sample of German entrepreneurs, bankers, DEMO students.
Although we feel that the basic comparisons would also hold with, e.g., the respective U.S.
groups, the relevance of country differences may not be underestimated. The Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data reveal striking DEMO differences not only in the
general level of entrepreneurial activity but also regarding the level of the drivers of
entrepreneurial motivation such as overconfidence (Koellinger et al., 2005). A natural step
to extend studies of the latter type and to, at the same time, build up DEMO the approach
suggested in our current contribution is to design and carry out cross-country experimental
comparisons of entrepreneurs’ and others’ decision making.
