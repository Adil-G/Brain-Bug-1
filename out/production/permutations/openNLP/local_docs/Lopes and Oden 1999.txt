The Role of Aspiration Level in DEMO Choice:
A Comparison of Cumulative Prospect Theory
and SPA Theory
Lola L. Lopes and Gregg C. Oden
University of Iowa
In recent years, descriptive models of risky choice have incorporated
features that reflect the importance DEMO particular outcome values in choice.
Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) does this by inserting a reference point in
the utility function. SPA (security-potentialaspiration) DEMO uses aspira-
tion level as a second criterion in the choice process. Experiment 1 compares
the ability of the CPT and SPA models to DEMO for the same within-sub-
jects data set and finds in favor of SPA. Experiment 2 replicates the main
finding of Experiment 1 in a DEMO design. The final discussion
brackets the SPA result by showing the impact on fit of both decreasing and
increasing the number of free parameters. DEMO also suggest how the SPA
approach might be useful in modeling investment decision making in a
descriptively more valid way and conclude with comments DEMO the relation
between descriptive and normative theories of risky choice.  1999 Academic Press
Formal models of decision making under risk can be found DEMO three disciplinary
guises. Until quite recently, almost all economists believed that DEMO makers
both should and do select risks that maximize expected utility. In contrast, invest-
ment professionals have seen investors as selecting portfolios that achieve an
optimal balance between risk and return. Psychologists, too, have explored DEMO
utility theory and portfolio theory as possible descriptive models, and they DEMO
also developed original information processing models focused on how people
choose rather than what people choose.
For the most part, these three disciplines have been isolated from one another,
although psychologists have been more eclectic DEMO their outlooks than others.
Recently, however, both psychologists and economists have been exploring a non-
linear modification of the expected utility model that DEMO term the ``decumulatively

weighted utility'' model. At present, this model has not affected practice in finance,
but we believe DEMO model can also be applied at the level of the individual investor.
In what follows, we first describe decumulatively weighted utility generically and
then present two specific psychological instantiations of the model, cumulative
prospect theory (DEMO 6 Kahneman, 1992), and SPA theory (Lopes, 1987,
DEMO, 1995). Second, we test the ability of these two theories to account for the
same set of data. Third, we suggest how these results might apply in the investment
context. Finally, we comment on fitting and testing complex, nonlinear models.
Decumulatively Weighted Utility
In a nutshell, the expected utility model asserts that when people choose between
alternative probability distributions over outcomes (i.e., lotteries or gambles), they
should (the economic model) and do (the psychological model) make their choices
so as to maximize a probability weighted (i.e., linear) average of the outcome
utilities. Although much evidence supports the idea that averaging rules can DEMO
people's choices and judgments reasonably well in a variety of tasks (Anderson,
1981), the linearity assumption of expected utility theory has not fared so well. Less
than a decade after the publication of DEMO Neumann and Morgenstern's (1947)
axiomatization of expected utility theory, Allais (19521979) demonstrated that
linearity failed in qualitative tests comparing choices DEMO which ``certainty'' was an
option to choices in which it was not.
For almost three decades afterward economists ignored these failures of linearity,DEMO
whereas psychologists assumed that they represented subject failures rather than
model failures. In the 1980s, however, some economists began to take the failures
DEMO and to seek out variants of expected utility that could better account for
behavior. An obvious candidate at the time was prospect theory (Kahneman 6
Tversky, 1979), but this model violated stochastic dominance, ``an DEMO that
many theorists [were] reluctant to give up'' (Tversky 6 DEMO, 1992, p. 299).
Instead, these economists began to explore DEMO normatively more acceptable idea of
decumulatively weighted utility. The first economic applications were proposed
independently by Quiggin (1982), Allais (1986), and DEMO (1987), followed quickly
by many others (Chew, Karni, 6 Safra, 1987; Luce, 1988; Schmeidler, 1989; Segal,
1989)DEMO
The best way to understand decumulative weighted utility is to start with the
structure of the expected value model:
n
EV= : pi DEMO ,(1)
i=1
in which the vi are the n possible outcomes listed in no particular order and the pi
are the outcomes' associated probabilities. Expected utility theory simply substitutes
utility, u(v), for monetary outcomes:
n
EU= : pi u(v i). (2)
i=1
288 LOPES AND ODEN
Weighted utility models (e.g., prospect theory) substitute decision weights, w( p), for
probabilities,
n
WU= : DEMO( pi) u(v i), (3)
i=1
but this DEMO the move that allows violations of stochastic dominance.
Decumulative weighted utility models recast the issue of transforming raw
probabilities to one of transforming decumulative DEMO:
n n
h \ : pj + (u(v i)&u(v i&1))
DWU= :
i=1 j=i
n
= : h(D i)(u(v i)&u(v i&1))DEMO (4)
i=1
In such models, the v i are ordered from lowest (worst outcome) to highest (best
outcome).
that is, Di
n
Di = j= i pj is the decumulative probability associated with outcome
vi ;
is the probability of obtaining an outcome at least as high as outcome vi .
Thus, D1 (the decumulative DEMO of the worst outcome, v 1 ) is 1 (you get at
least that for sure) and Dn+1 (the decumulative probability of DEMO the best
outcome, vn) is zero.
The function, h, maps decumulative probabilities onto the range (0, 1) and so
preserves dominance. It can also provide an alternative to using curvature in the
utility DEMO to model risk attitudes. For example, in expected utility theory, if
u(v) is a concave function of v, decision makers will DEMO sure things to actuarially
equivalent lotteries, a pattern termed ``risk aversion.'' Decumulative weighting can
predict the same pattern even while assuming that u(v)=v (a variant of decumulatively
weighted utility that we call decumulatively weighted value) by letting h(D)be a
convex function of D. Although the predicted behavior is the same, we call it
``security-mindedness'' in order to distinguish between utility-based and probability-
based mechanisms.
The other DEMO risk attitudes also have analogues in the decumulative weighted
value (or DEMO) model. These are given in Table 1. Both models can accommodate

risk neutrality (expected value maximizing behavior) and both can accommodate
the rejection of sure things in favor of actuarially equivalent lotteries (termed ``risk
seeking'' in expected utility theory and ``potential-mindedness'' by us). Both models
can also predict the ``cautiously DEMO'' (our term) pattern first described by
Markowitz (1959), DEMO which subjects buy both insurance and lottery tickets, thereby
paying premiums DEMO to gamble and other times to avoid gambling.
Cumulative Prospect Theory
In cumulative prospect theory (CPT), Tversky 6 Kahneman (1992) reformulated
the original prospect theory in terms of (de)cumulative weighted utility. The utility
function, u(v), was unchanged from the original, being concave (risk averse) for
gains and convex (risk seeking) for losses, DEMO the loss function assumed to be
steeper than the gain function (DEMO>1):
v:
u(v)= { &*(&v) ;
if
if
v0
v<0.
(5)
The decumulative weighting DEMO was also taken to differ for gains and losses.
For gains, DEMO hypothesized function has an inverse S shape that reinforces risk
aversion for most lottery types but tends toward risk seeking for long shots (lotteries
that have small probabilities of large prizes):
w+(D)=
D#
(D #+(1&D) # )1#
.(6)
For losses, the weighting function is cumulative rather than decumulative and
S-shaped rather than inverse S-shaped. It reinforces risk seeking for most lotteries
but tends toward DEMO aversion for long shots (lotteries that have small probabilities
of very DEMO losses):
P $
w&(P)= (P $ +(DEMO&P) $) 1$
.(7)
Thus, the utility functions DEMO (de)cumulative weighting functions of CPT are
largely (but not perfectly) mirror imaged from gains to losses, producing what
Tversky 6 Kahneman (1992) term ``a four-fold pattern'' in the predicted pattern of
lottery preferences.
There are two general features of CPT that should also be DEMO here. The first
is that CPT is based on a physical principle of diminishing sensitivity from a
reference point. In the case of utility, the reference point is usually assumed to be
zero (the status quo). In the case of (de)cumulative weights, there are reference
DEMO at 0 and at 1. In both cases, the rate of DEMO in the perceived magnitude
(of value or of likelihood) is assumed to be greatest near the reference point and
to diminish as one DEMO away.
290 LOPES AND ODEN
The second feature of CPT is that it, like all its predecessors in the weighted
value family, is a one-criterion model. Although there is much room in the model
for psychological variables DEMO operate, in the end, all these factors are melded into
a single assessment of lottery attractiveness.
SPA Theory
SPA theory (Lopes, 1987, 1990, 1995) is a dual criterion model in which the
process DEMO choosing between lotteries entails integrating two logically and psycho-
logically separate criteria
SPA= f [SP, A], (8)
where SP stands for a security-potential criterion and A for an aspiration criterion.
The SP (security-potential) DEMO is modeled by a decumulatively weighted
value rule (i.e., the model is identical to Eq. (4) except that the utility function is
DEMO to be linear1):
n
SP= : h(Di)(v i &v i&1). (9)
i=1
The decumulative weighting function, h(D), has the form
h(D)=wDqs +1 +(1&DEMO)[1&(1&D) qp +1] (10)
for both gains DEMO losses. The equation is derived from the idea that subjects assess
lotteries from the bottom up (a security-minded analysis), or the top down
(a potential-minded analysis), or both (a cautiously hopeful analysis).2 DEMO param-
eters qs and qp represent the rates at which attention to outcomes diminishes as the
evaluation process proceeds up or down. The parameter, w, determines the relative
weight of the S and P analyses. If w=1, the decision maker is strictly security-
minded. If w=0, the DEMO maker is strictly potential-minded. If 0<w<1, the
decision maker DEMO cautiously hopeful, with the degrees of caution and of hope
depending DEMO the relative magnitudes of w and 1&w. Although Eq. (10) omits
subscripts on parameters for notational simplicity, SPA theory follows CPT in
allowing qs , qp ,and w to assume different values for gains and for losses, moderat-
ing the relative importance of security and potential in the overall SP assessment.
1 Most theorists assume that u(v) is nonlinear without asking whether the monetary range under
consideration is wide DEMO for nonlinearity to be manifest in the data. We believe that u(v) probably
does have mild concavity that might be manifest in some cases (as, for example, when someone is
considering the huge payouts in state lotteries). But for narrower ranges, we prefer to ignore concavity
and let the decumulative weighting function carry the theoretical load.
2 DEMO do not provide the derivation of the SPA decumulative weighting function at this time because
it is not relevant to the present focus. Interested DEMO may contact us for details.
ASPIRATION LEVEL AND RISKY CHOICE
291
Unlike CPT, however, the decumulative DEMO function of SPA theory does
not switch between inverse S-shaped for gains and S-shaped for losses.
The A (aspiration) criterion operates on a DEMO of stochastic control (Dubins
6 Savage, 1976) in which subjects DEMO assumed to assess the attractiveness of
lotteries by the probability that a given lottery will yield an outcome at or above
the aspiration level, ::
A= p(v:). (11)
For present purposes, we treat the aspiration level as crisp, which is to say,
a discrete value that either is or is not satisfied. In principle, however, the aspiration
level may be fuzzy: some outcomes may satisfy DEMO aspiration level completely,
others to a partial degree, and still DEMO not at all. To model this, Eq. (11) would
need DEMO incorporate a particular probability, pi , according to the degree that DEMO
associated outcome, vi , satisfies the aspiration level (Oden 6 Lopes, 1997).
SPA theory and CPT share some significant psychological features: DEMO both
model the process by which subjects integrate probabilities and values by a
(de)cumulative weighting rule, and they both include a point DEMO the value dimen-
sion that has special significance to subjects (the DEMO point for CPT and the
aspiration level for SPA). Indeed, DEMO aspiration level may be considered to be a
kind of reference point. However, the theories differ three ways in how these
features function.
The first difference is in how the reference point (or aspiration level) DEMO its
impact. In CPT, the reference point is incorporated into the DEMO function and
influences subjects by marking an inflection point about which outcomes are first
organized into gains and losses, and then scaled nonlinearly in accord with a principle
of diminishing sensitivity. In SPA theory, the aspiration level participates in a
direct assessment of lottery attractiveness reflecting a principle DEMO stochastic control
and separate from the decumulatively weighted SP assessment. Because SP and A
embody different criteria, each may favor a different lottery. When this happens,
SPA theory predicts conflict, a prediction that does not follow from single-criterion
models such as CPT.
The second difference is that DEMO predicts a four-fold pattern across gain preferences
and loss preferences. Although some small imperfections in the symmetry of the pattern
might obtain due to DEMO differences in the value and weighting functions for gains
and losses, DEMO overall pattern should be one of reflection between gains and losses.
SPA theory, in contrast, allows considerable asymmetry between gains and losses.
In DEMO most commonly observed case, subjects appear to avoid risks strongly for
DEMO but to be more-or-less risk neutral for losses (Cohen, Jaffray, DEMO Said, 1987;
Hershey 6 Schoemaker, 1980; Schneider 6 Lopes, 1986; Weber 6 Bottom, 1989).
Protocols suggest that this is DEMO security-minded or cautiously hopeful sub-
jects set modest aspiration levels for gains, allowing the SP and A criteria to
reinforce one another. For losses, however, the same subjects set high aspiration
levels, hoping to lose little or nothing, and thereby setting up a conflict between the
A and the SP criteria (Lopes, 1995).
292 LOPES AND ODEN
The third difference is that SPA theory predicts DEMO in preference
patterns that depend on whether or not the aspiration level is guaranteed to be met
(by boosting all outcomes above the aspiration level) or guaranteed not to be met
(by pushing all outcomes DEMO the aspiration level) no matter which lottery of a
pair is DEMO For example, consider a cautiously hopeful decision maker choosing
between 850 DEMO sure versus a 5050 chance of 8100, else nothing. Suppose also DEMO
the decision maker wants to win ``at least something.'' Although the SP assessment
could favor the long shot mildly, the A assessment would favor the sure thing
strongly, leading to a choice of the sure thing. If 850 were added to all outcomes,
however, (e.g., 8100 for sure versus a 5050 chance at 8150, else 850) DEMO A assess-
ment would ``drop out'' (since both options satisfy DEMO aspiration level with certainty)
leaving the SP assessment to carry the day. CPT, in contrast, is qualitatively unaffected
by cases in which DEMO are all pushed upward or downward so long as no out-
comes cross the reference point. The experiments that follow use his third difference
DEMO distinguish between the two theories and test their abilities to account for subjects'
choices among a set of multioutcome lotteries.
EXPERIMENT 1
Method
DEMO and task. Subjects chose between actuarially equivalent pairs of five-out-
come lotteries comprising three positive (gain) sets and three negative (loss) sets.
DEMO standard positive lotteries are shown in Fig. 1. The tally marks represent lottery
tickets yielding the outcomes shown at the left. Each of these DEMO has 100
tickets and each has an expected value of approximately 8100. The names indicated
for the lotteries are for exposition only and were DEMO used with subjects.
Scaled positive and shifted positive lotteries were created by transforming the
outcomes in the standard positive lotteries linearly. (Examples are shown in Fig. 2.)
To create the shifted lotteries, standard positive outcomes were increased by 850
(bringing the expected value of the shifted positive lotteries to 8150). To create the
scaled positive lotteries, standard positive outcomes were multiplied by 1.145
(bringing the expected value of the scaled lotteries to 8114.50). The multiplicative
constant was chosen to equate the DEMO outcomes (8398) in the scaled and
shifted sets.
Standard negative, DEMO negative, and shifted negative lotteries were created by
appending a minus DEMO to the outcomes in the respective positive sets.
Design and subjects. Lotteries within stimulus set were paired in all possible
combinations ( 6 C2 DEMO pairs per set) and pairs were arrayed vertically on sheets of
DEMO letter paper. Two replications were created for each set differing in the order
of the lotteries on the page.
Pairs from the positive sets DEMO randomized together (within replication) with
the constraint that no particular lottery appeared on adjacent pages. Pairs from the
negative sets were randomized similarly. DEMO replication consisted of 45 pairs
(3 sets_15 pairs per set).

The subjects for this experiment were 80 undergraduate students at the University
of Wisconsin who served for extra credit in introductory psychology courses.
Procedure. DEMO were run in groups of two to four. Each subject was given
a notebook containing practice materials and the randomized stimulus pairs. At the
DEMO of the experiment, subjects were shown how to interpret the positive
DEMO and were told that the amount of prize money for each of the lotteries in
a pair was the same. Then they were told DEMO we were interested in their preferences
for distributions (i.e., how the prizes are distributed over tickets) and were given
three positive pairs for practice. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they would
prefer the top DEMO or the bottom lottery if they were allowed to draw a ticket
from either for free and keep the prize.
Next, subjects were shown exemplars of negative lotteries and were told that
these represented losses. They DEMO then asked to indicate for a set of three more
practice pairs which of each pair they would prefer if they were forced to DEMO a
ticket from one or the other and pay the loss out of their own pockets.
Stimulus notebooks were divided into five sections, the first containing the
practice pairs and the remaining four containing the four DEMO of stimulus pairs (two
positive replications and two negative replications). DEMO and negative replica-
tions were alternated with half of the subjects beginning with a positive replication
and the other half beginning with a negative DEMO Each set was preceded by
a colored sheet announcing that ``The next set of lotteries are all win [or loss]

preferences for the top or bottom lottery by circling ``T'' or ``B'' on a DEMO
answer sheet. The task took about an hour for most subjects. All choices were
hypothetical.
Results and Discussion
The data from Experiment 1 are DEMO in Fig. 3 for gains (left panel) and for
losses (DEMO panel). Lotteries are listed along the abscissas in the order of subject
preferences for the standard lotteries. The data have been pooled over DEMO,
replications, and stimulus pair. Each data point represents the proportion DEMO times
the average subject chose the lottery out of the total number of times that the
lottery was available for choice. Each lottery was DEMO 10 times (5 pairs_
2 replications) so that the maximum number of choices per subject for a given
lottery was 10 and the DEMO was zero.
The data reveal four patterns that are of special significance: (1) For both gains
and losses, there are obvious main DEMO for lotteries [F(5, 395)=93.08 and 25.00,
respectively, p<0.0001 for both] as well as interactions between lottery and condi-
tion DEMO(10, 790)=48.99 and 8.09, respectively, p<0.0001 for both]; (2) For both
gains and losses, the data for standard and scaled stimuli are virtually identical

slopes of the preference functions for the standard DEMO scaled stimuli are steeper for
gains than for losses; and (4) the preference functions for the shifted stimuli are
nonmonotonically related to the preference functions for standard and scaled
stimuli, especially for gains, and DEMO pattern of nonmonotonicity reverses between
gains and losses. Preference for lower risk lotteries decreases for gains and increases
for losses whereas preference for higher DEMO lotteries increases for gains and
decreases for losses. As will be seen, these differences between preference functions
for shifted lotteries and preference functions for standard and scaled lotteries are
critical to disentangling the roles of decumulative (or cumulative) weighting and
aspiration level in risky choice.
In what follows, we use the Solver function of Microsoft Excel to fit both CPT
(Tversky 6 Kahneman, 1992) and SPA theory (Lopes, 1990; DEMO 6 Lopes, 1997)
to the data. Solver is an iterative DEMO fitting procedure that adjusts free
parameters to optimize the fit of a model to a data set according to whatever
criterion the user specifies. DEMO used root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) between
predicted and obtained. In order to lessen the possibility of finding only a local
minimum, good practice requires starting with one's best guesses of parameter
values and then, once a minimum is found, checking the fit by systematically alter-
ing parameter values and rerunning the program to make sure that a better fit
cannot DEMO found. The values we report are the best that we could find.
For both CPT and SPA, we fit the models to the aggregate choice proportions
(given in Table 2) for the two-alternative choice task DEMO subjects performed and
then pooled the prediction across choice pair to obtain means (as are shown for the
obtained data in Fig. 3). Although we had too few replications to fit single subject
data, visual inspection of single subject means revealed that the patterns of primary
interest DEMO evident at the single subject level, being especially clear for strongly
DEMO subjects and somewhat attenuated for subjects whose preferences
tended toward cautious hopefulness or potential-mindedness.

Fitting CPT. As noted previously, CPT is a one-criterion model in which both
values and probabilities are transformed psychologically during the DEMO evalua-
tion process. The utility function (Eq. (5)) has three parameters: : defines the
curvature of the function for gains (or DEMO above the reference point); ; defines
the curvature of the function for losses (or values below the reference point); and
* defines the relative slope of the two functions, with the loss function specified to
be steeper than the gain function (*>1).
Weights in CPT also are defined separately for gains and for losses, as shown in
Eqs. (6) and (7). For gains, the function DEMO decumulative with a parameter, #,
regulating both the curvature and DEMO point of the inverse S-shaped weighting
function. For losses, the function DEMO cumulative with an analogous parameter, $,

CPT was fit simultaneously to the data for the three scaling conditions (standard,
scaled, and shifted) and for both outcome types (gains and losses), estimating a
single set of six parameter values. The fitting process can best be understood by
reference DEMO Table 3. Matrix A shows the pair choice data for the scaled positive
pairs. Each entry is the proportion of times that subjects preferred DEMO column
lottery to the row lottery. Lotteries are ordered across the columns in descending
order of preference and down the rows in ascending order DEMO preference. Com-
plementary pairs of entries sum to 1.00, e.g., entries (1, 1) and (6, 6) in which
riskless (RL) and long shot (LS) lotteries are opposed. The value 0.500 is entered
in the minor diagonal where opposing lotteries are identical. These pairs DEMO not
included in the stimulus set for obvious reasons.
Matrix B gives the best fitting predictions of CPT for scaled positive pairs
obtained iteratively DEMO minimizing the root mean square deviation between obtained
and predicted choice proportions. The utility and weighting functions of CPT were
fit using the five DEMO and weight parameters described above to estimate CPT
attractiveness3 values for the six various lotteries. These values are shown as the
column and row DEMO in Matrix B.
3 We use the term ``attractiveness'' to refer to individual lottery values. Others have used ``strength-of-
preference'' to mean DEMO same thing, but we prefer to distinguish between individual lottery assessments
(attractiveness) and choices (or preferences) between lotteries.

FIG. 4. Predictions of CPT pooled over stimulus DEMO using the six parameter values shown in
Table 4. h, standard; m, scaled; M, shifted.
The second and final step was to use the CPT attractiveness values as input to
a pair-choice process that DEMO modeled using the logistic function of CPT difference
scores shown below4:
p(CPT1>2)= 1 . (12)
1+e &k(CPT1 &CPT2 )
The function predicts the proportion of times that lottery 1 is preferred to lottery
2 based on the two individual attractiveness values. DEMO function has a single
parameter, k, that is inversely related to the variance of the distribution of dif-
ference scores, CPT1 &CPT DEMO . Although it might seem reasonable to allow CPT to
fit separate k parameters for gains and for losses, the second k would be redundant
with * and would, in the present case, allow * DEMO fall below 1 (see Footnote 5).
Figure 4 shows the DEMO predictions of CPT to the data for gains (left
panel) and for losses (right panel). Parameter value are in Table 2. Although the
RMSD of 0.0810 is respectable for fitting 90 data points with DEMO parameters,
a comparison of predictions and data (Fig. 3) reveals a qualitative discrepancy for
the shifted gain lotteries. Although CPT is able DEMO capture the general flattening of
this preference function relative to the standard and scaled functions, all but the
prediction for the long shot are monotonically decreasing. In contrast, subjects'
preferences for the shifted rectangular, DEMO, and long shot lotteries were all
greater than for the shifted DEMO shot. Moreover, the nonmonotonicity that is
induced for the shifted long DEMO comes at the expense of incorrectly predicting non-
monotonicity for the standard and scaled long shots as well.
A second issue concerns the CPT DEMO values (see Table 4). Beginning with
the parameters for the DEMO functions, note that although the function for gains is

individual lottery assessments onto choice has not been specified. The logistic function that we apply
here and below is commonly DEMO as the cumulative probability distribution function in statistical
decision theory models of the two-alternative choice process (Luce 6 Galanter, 1963) and is presumed
to be neutral with respect to its impact on CPT's and DEMO's ability to fit the qualitative features of the
data.

sharply curved (:=0.426), the function for losses is DEMO to linear ( ;=0.942).
Second, looking at the probability weights, note that the function for gains shows
considerable nonlinearity (#=0.685), DEMO the function for losses is again essen-
tially linear ($=0.980). DEMO, looking at *, the parameter that determines the
relative slopes of the utility functions for gains and losses, note that it has reached
its floor value of 1.00.5 Although the values of these parameters are DEMO with
the observed fact that the loss data are essentially linear and relatively shallow in
slope, there is nothing in CPT that would lead one to expect this large asymmetry
between gains and losses. Indeed, CPT is well-known for its prediction of reflection
in preferences between gains and DEMO (i.e., the four-fold pattern).
In all, then, CPT does reasonably well in fitting the data if one considers only
RMSD. When DEMO looks at qualitative effects, however, CPT fails with the shifted
gains. Moreover, in order to get a reasonable fit, CPT must make DEMO of parameter
values that are inconsistent with the underlying psychophysical principle (DEMO
sensitivity from a reference point) on which both utility and weighting DEMO are
theorized to depend.
Fitting SPA theory. As explained previously, SPA DEMO proposes that risky
choice involves two criteria, one based on a DEMO of decumulatively weighted
averages of probabilities and outcomes (the SP criterion) and the other based
on a comparison of probabilities of achieving an DEMO level (the A criterion).
The SP assessment process (Eq. (DEMO)) has three parameters: q defines the degree of
attention to DEMO outcomes in assessments of security (qs) and potential (q p),
whereas w defines the relative importance of security and potential assessments
DEMO In principle, all three parameters might differ between gains and losses. DEMO
A assessment process (Eq. (5)) has a single parameter, :, the aspiration level, which
can also differ for gains (:+ ) and losses (:& ). Although : might need to be fit as
a free parameter in some cases (e.g., with continuous DEMO distributions or with
5 A somewhat improved RMSD (0.0770) resulted when * was allowed to drop to 0.400 (i.e., for the
gain DEMO to be considerably steeper than the loss function). Although this value is consistent with
the observed fact that the standard and scaled gain DEMO are steeper than the standard and scaled loss
data, the value DEMO not consistent with CPT's oft-repeated claim that ``losses loom larger than gains.''

manipulated aspiration levels), our stimuli and choice DEMO justified fixing :+
at 1 and :& at zero.6
In fitting SPA theory to the data, we modeled the SP criterion and the A
criterion separately (but not sequentially) and integrated the results into DEMO final
choice. The procedure is schematized in Table 5. Matrix A gives the scaled positive
data and Matrix B gives the best-fitting predictions based DEMO just the SP criterion.
The column and row headings are estimated SP attractiveness values. We let w
differ between gains (w+ ) and losses (w& ) but, in order to hold our parameters to
six, set qs =q p =q and used the same single value for both gains and losses. The
entries in the cells are choice proportions, p(SP 1>2), obtained by applying the
logistic function to DEMO scores just as we did in fitting CPT:
1 ) . (13)
p(SP 1>2)=1+e &k(SP1 &SP2
The parameter, k, is inversely related to the variance of the distribution DEMO difference
scores, SP 1 &SP 2 .
Matrix C shows best-fitting predictions based on just the A criterion. The row
and column headings DEMO the probability that the row (or column) lottery will
yield a value that meets the aspiration level (e.g., the riskless gain lottery, column
1, guarantees a nonzero payoff whereas the peaked gain lottery, DEMO 2, has only
a 0.96 probability of a nonzero payoff). DEMO table entries are choice proportions,
p(A 1>2), obtained by submitting the A values to a relative ratio process having a
DEMO, t,0t that controls contrast. Equation (14) shows the process DEMO

The difference between gains and losses reflects the fact that gains engender an

6 Our assumption concerning the values of the aspiration level is analogous to Kahneman and
Tversky's assumption (1979; Tversky 6 Kahneman, 1992) that the reference point of the utility function
is at zero. Although we, as they, might sometimes want DEMO modify this simplifying assumption, in the
present case the lottery outcomes DEMO spaced widely enough that minimum (or maximum) outcomes are
good approximations for what might be ``at least a small gain'' or ``no DEMO than a small loss'' in choices
between more continuous lotteries.

The parameter values for the SPA DEMO are in Table 6. Although the values are
generally reasonable, the DEMO for the SP component are not far from an expected
value fit (w=0.50, qs=q p =1). We believe this reflects the simplifying DEMO
that we imposed on the parameters of the SP criterion. We shall have more to say
about the matter in the final discussion.
EXPERIMENT DEMO
It is sometimes thought that the opportunities for comparison offered by repeated
measures designs create choice patterns that might not occur if subjects made DEMO
a single choice. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to replicate the main finding of
Experiment 1 (i.e., that shifted lotteries are evaluated DEMO than standard or
scaled lotteries) using a between-subjects design. We also DEMO to collect subjects'
reasons for their choices. Because between-subject experiments are costly in terms
of the required number of subjects, we used only positive lotteries.
Method
The stimuli were the 45 pairs comprising the standard, scaled, and shifted
positive sets. Each pair was printed separately on a single sheet of U.S. letter paper.
Sheets were randomized and distributed at DEMO beginning of experimental sessions
to subjects who were participating in other related experiments. In a given session,
different subjects had different pairs. Consequently, it was necessary to describe how
to interpret the lotteries in very DEMO terms, never mentioning particular out-
comes or numbers of tickets.
As DEMO Experiment 1, subjects were asked to mark which of the two DEMO they
would prefer if they were allowed to draw a ticket from either for free and keep the
prize for themselves. They were also DEMO to write a sentence or two explaining the
basis for their preference.

choice pairs.
Results and Discussion
The data from Experiment 2 are shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, the means are noisier
than the means from Experiment 1, a result one might anticipate not only from the
different subjects contributing to each data point, but also from the reduced
amount of data going into each data point (400 choices per data point in the

case). Despite the noise, however, a chi-square analysis shows that the key differen-
ces between the three scaling conditions were replicated. Specifically, (1) the
patterns of preferences for standard stimuli and scaled stimuli do not differ signifi-
cantly from one DEMO, /2(1)=1.65, p>0.05; whereas (2) the pattern of preference
for shifted stimuli differs significantly from the overall pattern of DEMO for standard
and scaled stimuli, /2(1)=25.13, p<0.001.
DEMO 7 illustrates the reasons that subjects gave for their choices, taking DEMO
long shot (LS) and short shot (SS) lotteries as examples. (These are the lotteries
that are shown in Fig. 2.) Protocols DEMO the scaled condition are on the left and for
the shifted condition are on the right. In each set, the first four subjects (DEMO text)
chose with the majority whereas the last two subjects (DEMO) chose with the
minority.
In the scaled condition, the majority of subjects (5 of 8) preferred the short shot
to the long DEMO Protocols 1 through 4 show clearly that such subjects are concerned
with achieving a nonzero outcome. In terms of SPA theory, the A criterion seems
to be outweighing the SP criterion. Neither of the remaining two DEMO seems
particularly concerned with avoiding zero (the A criterion). Consequently, the extra
high outcomes in the long shot have more impact (the SP criterion).
In the shifted condition, the majority of subjects (DEMO of 10) preferred the long shot
to the short shot. In DEMO, protocols 7, 8, and 10 convey the sense that the DEMO
guaranteed outcome is good enough (the A criterion is fully satisfied DEMO both lotteries)
allowing the subjects to choose the slightly riskier long shot (the SP criterion). In
contrast, protocol 11 suggests that DEMO subject has adjusted his or her aspiration
level upward, so that DEMO is now equivalent to ``not winning'' (the A criterion)
DEMO protocol 12 reveals a subject who focused on the relative magnitudes of
high and low outcomes, but placed more weight on the low outcomes (the SP
criterion).
In sum, then, Experiment 2 confirms that preference patterns differ for shifted
lotteries and for standard or scaled lotteries DEMO when the data are gathered in a
between-subjects design. Moreover, the DEMO show, as SPA theory predicts,
that this result reflects differences DEMO the relative impacts of SP and A criteria under
the shifted and scaled or standard conditions. In the shifted condition, all lotteries
satisfy the A criterion for gains and none satisfy it for losses, allowing the SP
criterion to manifest itself more strongly in either case. In the DEMO and standard
conditions, however, there are large differences in the degree to which the A
criterion is satisfied, reducing the importance of the SP criterion overall.
DISCUSSION
The model comparison in Experiment 1 showed that, on six parameters, SPA
does a better job than CPT of fitting the present set of choice data. Not only is the
RMSD for DEMO 0 smaller, the model also captures (as CPT does not) DEMO
nonmonotonic relation between preferences for shifted lotteries and preferences for
standard and scaled lotteries. Experiment 2 reinforced this finding by replicating the
critical nonmonotonicity DEMO gain lotteries in a between-subjects design. It also
306
LOPES AND ODEN
provided protocols confirming that the nonmonotonicity may arise DEMO adding
850 to standard positive lotteries eliminates aspiration level as a consideration for
most subjects, thus enhancing the impact of the decumulatively weighted SP
criterion. In what follows, we discuss the implications of this result for modeling
investment risk. We also provide comments on fitting complex models along DEMO
two instructive comparisons to the six-parameter SPA model. We end with a
discussion of the relation between descriptive and normative theories.
Risk Taking and DEMO Level
It has often been pointed out that when people are in economic difficulty, they
tend to take risks that they would avoid under better circumstances. This tendency
appears among sophisticated managers in troubled firms (Bowman,1980, 1982) as
well as among unsophisticated subsistence farmers (Kunreuther 6 Wright, 1979).
Experimental studies using managers as subjects have also confirmed the tendency
toward risk-taking for losses, at least when ruin is not at issue (Laughhunn, Payne,
6 Crum, 1980; Payne, Laughhunn, 6 Crum, 1981). Standard thinking in invest-
ment theory would DEMO lead one to expect risk taking in threatening situations.
Instead, hard-pressed DEMO makers should value low risk over high expected
return and choose accordingly.
The S-shaped utility function of prospect theory seems to provide an explanation
DEMO this paradoxical risk-taking: people take risks when they face losses because
DEMO utility function for losses is ``risk seeking'' (i.e., convex). Though one can
criticize the circularity of the ``explanation,'' it at least predicts preferences better
than the more standard assumption of uniform ``risk DEMO'' (i.e., diminishing
marginal utility). But predicting preferences is only half the story, especially when
predictions fail, as they often do DEMO experimental studies of preferences for losses
with students (Cohen, Jaffray, DEMO Said, 1987; Hershey 6 Schoemaker, 1980;
Schneider 6 Lopes, 1986; Weber 6 Bottom, 1989) as well as with managers
(DEMO 6 Wehrung, 1986). The other half of the story can DEMO found in
protocol data. Studies by Mao (1970) and by Petty and Scott (cited in Payne,
Laughhunn, 6 Crum, 1980) DEMO that managers tend to define investment risk
as the probability of not achieving a target rate of return (that is to say, an DEMO
tion level).
No one can doubt that expected return (i.e., expected or mean value) is a central
and well-understood concept for managers, but the concept of risk is less well
understood. In portfolio theory, for example, risk is usually equated with outcome
variance (Markowitz, DEMO) but this is not entirely satisfactory descriptively since
it treats wins DEMO losses alike. Other approaches to defining risk try to bypass this
objection by restricting the variance computation to losses (i.e., the semivariance)
DEMO by computing risk as a probability weighted average of deviations below a target
level (Fishburn, 1977). Few, however, have explored the DEMO of modeling risk
as the raw probability of not achieving an aspiration level. One who has is Manski
(1988) who developed the idea DEMO what he called a utility mass model. Another
approach that incorporates raw probabilities comes from Weber (1988) who
augmented an expectation model with DEMO probabilities of winning, losing,
and breaking even.
ASPIRATION LEVEL AND RISKY CHOICE
307
SPA theory incorporates both notions, each in a separate criterion. On the SP
side, a security-minded weighting function (or a cautiously hopeful function dis-
playing more caution than hope) DEMO more attention to the worst outcomes than
to better outcomes. On the A side, the model operates on the probability of achiev-
ing the aspiration level. Although normative models usually focus on a single
criterion, descriptive models must go where subjects lead. In the case at hand, the
subjects seem to be saying that they understand and use the term DEMO'' in both
distributional and aspirational senses. For example, in Table DEMO, two subjects refer
explicitly to risk. In Protocol 8, one subject uses the concept in the A criterion
sense: risk is the chance of winning less. In Protocol 10, however, another subject
does not DEMO chances, but rather focuses on differences in prize amounts, an
SP-focused analysis.
Practitioners work at the boundary between normative and descriptive. Clients
expect DEMO (the normative function) in how to achieve their personal goals
(DEMO descriptive function). For the client who is concerned about not meeting a
target return, there seems little point in discussing variance. It would seem better
for the professional to recognize in a client's spoken DEMO the relevance of those
mathematical rules that seem most applicable and, DEMO, to explain in simple
fashion, properties of the rules that may not be self-evident.
Although much has been claimed since von Neumann and DEMO (1947)
about the dire consequences of violating linearity, recent examination of alternative
rules based on decumulative weighted utility and aspiration criteria (e.g., Manski,
1988; March, 1996; Yaari, 1987) suggests that DEMO alternatives are neither better
nor worse than maximizing expected utility. They are, however, different and seem
to come closer to doing what people DEMO done.
Pushing the Model Tests
In Experiment 1, we fit the DEMO and SPA models on the same number of free
parameters even though SPA theory could reasonably use several more. In order
to better illuminate DEMO roles of the various psychological components of the theory,
we now bracket the 6-parameter SPA fit by comparing it to a 0-parameter fit DEMO
a 10-parameter fit.
The top panel of Fig. 7 shows what happens when the SP criterion of SPA
theory is neutralized by setting its DEMO to yield the expected value for all
lotteries (w=0.50, q s =q p =1.00), thus allowing the A criterion to dominate. We DEMO
the aspiration level here as we did previously: : gains>0; : losses=0. The choice
rule is also zero-parameter, assuming that subjects choose whichever lottery has the
higher value on the A criterion and are DEMO if lotteries tie on aspiration level.
The A criterion alone produces a reasonable quantitative fit, with an RMSD of
0.1206. Although it may seem surprising that such a simple mechanism does so well
in fitting complex DEMO given the very complicated models that have been favored
for risky choice recently (including both CPT and SPA), the result maps well onto
the classic finding of information processing studies using duplex bets (Payne 6
Braunstein, 1971; Slovic 6 Lichtenstein, 1968) that probability of winning DEMO
the choice process. Still, the best that aspiration can do by DEMO with the shifted
data is to fit a flat line. Aspiration alone also predicts a mirror symmetry (reflection

in preferences) between gains and losses whereas the actual loss preference functions
are much flatter than the DEMO preference functions for all three lottery types.
The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows what happens with a full, 10-parameter fit of
SPA theory. The fit (RMSD=0.0484) is obviously much better than the 6-parameter
fit. DEMO interests us more, however, is that removing constraints on the SP param-
eters reveals theoretically meaningful values (see Table 8). Whereas previously the SP
criterion came very close to an expected value criterion, the new parameter values
suggest important process differences between gains and losses. For DEMO, it appears
that the bottom-up (security) evaluation is more important DEMO the top-down
(potential) evaluation whereas, for losses, the top-down (DEMO) evaluation appears
more important than the bottom-up (security) evaluation. Similarly, differences in the
w parameter also suggest that the importance of security DEMO greater for gains than for
losses (w+ >w&). Thus, SPA parameters confirm the CPT-based intuition that
subjects do, indeed, evaluate DEMO options more favorably for losses than for gains.
There is, however, an important difference between the mechanisms used by
CPT and SPA to DEMO for these differences between gains and losses. CPT's

zero reference point provides the rationale for qualitative inversions of its utility
function (from concave for gains to convex for losses) and DEMO decumulative
weighting function (from inverse S-shaped for gains to S-shaped for DEMO). Thus,
CPT specifies that the value processing mechanisms and probability weighting
mechanisms used by subjects differ qualitatively for gains and losses. SPA, on the
other hand, allows the relative attention paid to worst outcomes and best outcomes
to shift as a function of domain (gains versus losses) and also allows the relative
importance of the SP and A components to differ between gains and losses. But
domain-mediated reference effects in DEMO theory are potentially applicable to a
broader range of domain differences.
For example, Edwards 6 von Winterfeldt (1986) propose that a person's risk
attitude may be different in different ``transaction streams.'' Choices involving
DEMO in what they call the ``quick cash'' and ``play money'' streams (the former
being what people have available in their wallets and the latter being money reserved
for enjoyment) should be less risk averse (i.e., less security-minded) than choices
involving ``capital assets'' and ``income and fixed expenditures'' streams. Similarly,
MacCrimon 6 Wehrung (1986) DEMO that executives are more risk averse in
making decisions about their own personal investments than they are about
business investments. Shifts of these sorts DEMO one's willingness to accept risk need
not involve gainloss shifts. Instead, they may involve only differences in outcome
scale (large versus small DEMO stream) or differences in real-world expecta-
tions or consequences (personal decisions versus business decisions). The param-
eters of SPA theory, while restricting the decumulative weighting function to an
inverse S shape for both gains DEMO losses, nevertheless allow for modeling this
broader class of reference effects DEMO differences in the relative attention paid to
bad versus good outcomes in the SP assessment and through the relative impor-
tance accorded to SP DEMO A assessments in the final choice.
The Importance of Normative Theory for Description and vice versa
In most of economics, expected utility theory remains the workhorse of academic
researchwhich is to say, of normative researchdespite its poor fit to data from
310
LOPES AND ODEN
psychological experiments. Recently, however, a number of DEMO have turned
their attention to testing expected utility theory in laboratory settings involving
stylized economic games. Up to now, this new enterprise has been doggedly empirical
and intently focused on theoretically appropriate task instantiation and on DEMO
tal rigor and control. Despite this attention to detail, however, the predictions of
the theory have frequently not been borne out, leaving the experimentalists with the
not inconsiderable task of persuading their colleagues that the DEMO's failures are
meaningful and should not be overlooked (for reviews, see the essays by Smith,
1982, 1989, 1991; and the various chapters in Kagel 6 Roth, 1995). There has not,
however, been a commensurate effort from these researchers to develop better
theory, although Roth (1995, p. 18) has pointed out that at DEMO some of those who
ran the earliest economic experiments expected that experimental data would con-
tribute to the development of both better descriptive theories DEMO better normative
theories.
Most economists view their discipline as one that deals with ideally rational
behavior and, thus, attach little significance to discrepancies DEMO what the
theory predicts and what people actually do. Psychologists, on DEMO other hand, view
their task as one of predicting behavior and DEMO its cognitive sources in
psychologically meaningful terms, whether or not that DEMO is rational. The
utility and probability weighting functions of CPT rest on perceptual concepts. The
SP and A components of SPA theory rest on DEMO and motivational concepts.
Thus, both theories provide a psychological grounding that DEMO each to appeal
directly to intuitions via easily understood and compellingly named components.
Intuitiveness is not enough, however. Mathematical analysis of the sort pursued
here is necessary to specify the quantitative mechanisms from which theoretical
predictions DEMO and to confirm that it is these specific mechanisms that provide the
best account of behavior. History shows that it is easy to conflate DEMO with
explanations, especially when the explanations appeal to intuition. Thus, the
phenomenon of risk aversion became conflated with the idea of diminishing
marginal DEMO (concavity) because the intuition was powerful and, indeed, is
accurate, that constant marginal gains or losses in assets are more noticeable to
poor people than to rich people. Conflation of phenomena with explanation is
DEMO hazardous to theoretical advancement in that it suppresses interest in
psychologically important alternative explanations, such as the aspiration and
decumulatively weighted utility mechanisms on which this paper has focused.
The model comparisons we presented pitted competing DEMO mechanisms
against one another while constraining them to the same number of free parameters.
For the data set at hand, SPA theory provided the better fit, both quantitatively
and qualitatively. However, a more important comparison DEMO reside in the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the three different parameterizations of SPA
theory. On the one hand, the zero-parameter model, relying DEMO on the aspiration
level mechanism, did surprisingly well in providing a DEMO fit to the data. That a
mechanism as simple as this was overlooked as an alternative to more complicated
accounts is testimony to the DEMO power that the ``best existing theory'' has
to stifle research into alternatives. On the other hand, the 6- and 10-parameter
versions of SPA theory show the necessity of the SP component for modeling

preferences among the shifted lotteries and DEMO capturing the relative flattening of
preferences for loss lotteries. Although the possible contributions of aspiration level
should not have been overlooked, theorists and experimentalists since Bernoulli
have not been foolish in pursuing weighted utility models. Aspiration DEMO is
simply too simple.
SPA theory is a descriptive theory, through DEMO through. Its dual choice criteria
the security-potential criterion and the aspiration criterionare both included
because each seems necessary to adequately capture human choices under DEMO It
is worth noting, however, that even though these two criteria are inconsistent with
expected utility maximization except in special cases, the rationality of each has
been defended recently on normative grounds, (e.g., see Manski's (1988) utility
mass model and Yaari's (1987) DEMO weighted value model). Although
there is still a great divide between normative and descriptive theories of risky
choice, perhaps we are seeing the first evidence that descriptive research is finally,
as Roth (1995, DEMO 22) put it, ``speaking to theorists.''
