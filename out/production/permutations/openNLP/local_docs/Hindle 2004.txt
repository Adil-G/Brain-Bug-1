DEMO
Cognition Research: A
Canonical Development
Approach
Kevin Hindle
This article presents DEMO structured, manageable approach to the complex problem of how to
choose, from the vast arsenal loosely labeled “qualitative methods,” sets of techniques
DEMO to advancement of the emerging ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition. Summary
consideration is given to four key issues of philosophical context as a necessary predicate
DEMO presentation of a “canonical development” approach, stylized in diagrammatic form. The
DEMO is able to accommodate due regard for both methodological controversy and oper-
ational complexity without being overwhelmed by either. Three illustrative examples indi-
cate DEMO use of the approach can stimulate a researcher to create productive matches
between questions evolved from the entrepreneurial cognition canon and techniques
selected from DEMO complex array of qualitative methods.
Thus, it is fruitful for us DEMO focus on how entrepreneurs acquire knowledge about the
environment, and how DEMO is processed in the minds of the entrepreneurs.

Introduction: A Problem of Combination
The Research Problem
The research problem is to combine a view about the near future of the DEMO dis-
cipline of entrepreneurial cognition, with a view about the selection DEMO qualitative
methods most likely to be useful to that process of emergence. Separately, each task is
difﬁcult: in combination they are formidable. My DEMO “solution” to the problem of
combination is to concentrate on developing an approach to the selection of methods
rather than providing either advocacy of DEMO general philosophy of research or detailed
redescription of the technical complexities of a vast array of particular operational

techniques. The article presents a potentially fruitful canonical development approach to
the DEMO of methods in the new ﬁeld. I deﬁne the “canon” of a discipline as the list of
books or works accepted by a distinct DEMO community as constituting authoritative
statements of knowledge in their well-bounded ﬁeld. In dynamic ﬁelds—and entrepre-
neurship and entrepreneurial cognition both qualify—new discoveries and new DEMO of
discovering often challenge the “state of the art.” It then becomes a key issue to combine
respect for the current state of knowledge (and the art and science that produced it), with
the open-mindedness DEMO accommodate new perspectives on the knowledge discovery
process. In my conception, DEMO canonical development approach to the accommodation and
implementation of new methodologies, DEMO a way to combine the best aspects and
minimize the worst of two more common but less productive alternatives: paradigm con-
ﬂict and philosophical avoidance.
At one extreme is what might be called the paradigm-conﬂict perspective; an attempt
to tackle the methods choice problem based on arguing the DEMO merits of different a
priori generic philosophies of research. At the other extreme, is what might be called the
philosophical-avoidance perspective, which regards DEMO and all matters of metaphysical
context as simply too hard to deal with and too productive of conﬂict. Accordingly, dis-
cussion of philosophical context is sacriﬁced to the expedient need to articulate the
complex mechanical aspects DEMO data collection and analysis. Miles and Huberman (1994,
p. 2) summarize these latter sentiments:
At times it seems as if the DEMO, often polemical arguments of different schools
of thought about how qualitative DEMO should be done properly use more energy
than the actual research does. We confess to liking George Homans’ (Homans, 1949)
remark: “People who write about methodology often forget that it is a matter of DEMO
egy, not of morals.” (Miles & Huberman, 1994)
Michael DEMO that any process of method selection that lacks an appropriate
and well-articulated contextual framework is rootless and insubstantial (Michael, 1985,
p. 94)DEMO This places Michael ﬁrmly in the camp of all who recognize that knowledge
construction processes affect knowledge outputs in ways that render it highly DEMO
to make bold claims about objectivity. In the natural sciences the famous Heisenberg
uncertainty principle recognizes the distorting effects of the measuring instrument upon
DEMO object it measures and the measurement thus produced. In the social sciences, Haber-
mas has attempted to articulate the politics of knowledge production (DEMO, 1972,
1974) and to build a theory of knowledge-constitutive interests (Habermas, 1984, 1987).
Habermas is recognized as one of the foremost exponents of the now uncontroversial
proposition that differences among research perspectives DEMO not alone due to research
methods and techniques (akin to the DEMO of knowledge production) but the way
researchers are located in the DEMO act (akin to the machinery operator in a factory
setting).
DEMO what am I to do in this essay? Within the conﬁnes DEMO a journal article, there is
no space for either elaborate philosophical DEMO or exposition of even a fraction of
the mechanical details of the now vast arsenal of qualitative methods. In this essay,
therefore, I will try to make a case for a methods choice regime that DEMO indicative rather
than prescriptive and illustrative rather than comprehensive. I will try to steer a middle
course between the extremities of the paradigm-conﬂict and DEMO per-
spectives by confronting rather than avoiding what I regard as the minimum amount of
philosophical discussion mandated by the task, because it is a task of such compelling
urgency.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
The Urgent Need for Greater Use of Qualitative Methods
In entrepreneurship research, we simply have to try to motivate scholars who are
more comfortable DEMO to the positivist pole of the paradigm spectrum to contemplate
and involve themselves in qualitative research or at least to learn to respect the DEMO
edge perspectives and knowledge production techniques of those for whom the general
linear model is not the only engine of wisdom. In my view, unless entrepreneurship gen-
erally and entrepreneurial cognition particularly begin to embrace higher DEMO of
higher caliber qualitative research, the relevance and potency of the DEMO canon
will be severely compromised by a lack of the methodological variety that is so strongly
displayed in other social sciences.
There has been DEMO explosion in the use of qualitative methods in almost every domain
of the social sciences except entrepreneurship. More than a decade ago, Miles and Huber-
man, in the introduction to the second edition of their renowned sourcebook on qualita-
tive data analysis techniques wrote:
The expansion of DEMO inquiry since the ﬁrst edition of this book (Miles &
Huberman, 1984) has been phenomenal. The base of books and articles we
DEMO for this second edition has more than tripled over that for the ﬁrst. (Miles
& Huberman, 1994)
Between 1994 and 2004 the DEMO of the “qualitative base” would, conser-
vatively, be of the order of twenty-fold. However, qualitative methods are demonstrably
underrepresented in both entrepreneurship research, generally, and entrepreneurial cog-
nition research, speciﬁcally. Despite occasional special efforts (Gartner & Birley, 2002)
and sporadic individual contributions, it is fair to say that quantitative methodology
within a positivist or postpositivist paradigm DEMO the entrepreneurship research
literature in both the mindset of the majority of its practitioners and the volume of output
in journals addressing the ﬁeld. DEMO their review of the decade-plus of entrepreneurship
research since Low and MacMillan’s (1988) purview of the discipline, Chandler and
Lyon (2001) reviewed four hundred and sixteen double-blind, refereed journal articles
in nine top-tier journals. They found that only 18% of the empirical studies in their
sample DEMO any qualitative techniques whatsoever. They cited only two qualitative
research methods as prominent in this group of studies. There was content analysis of
documents—which DEMO qualitative methodologists would claim as a “mixed” or “quasi-
positivist” method. And there were 54 case studies of which 39 used retrospective inter-
viewing DEMO only 8 embraced real-time approaches of frequent interviews or participant
observation.
The scarcity and lack of variety of qualitative methods is replicated when one
DEMO, speciﬁcally, at the entrepreneurial cognition canon itself. A literature review by
Forbes (1999) comports strongly with my deﬁnition of the “canon” of DEMO discipline as the
list of books or works accepted by a distinct scholarly community as constituting author-
itative statements of knowledge in their well-bounded DEMO Forbes reviewed thirty-four
substantial studies in the emerging ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition (Forbes, 1999).
Twenty-ﬁve of these were empirical studies. Of these, seventeen were questionnaire
surveys, analyzed using parametric statistics. This represents a stunning lack of variety.
There were two other quantitative research designs and only DEMO qualitative studies: one
on causal mapping; one ﬁeld observation study; DEMO semi-structured depth interview
design and three case research designs. This paucity of qualitative work needs urgent
redress.

The Case for a Middle Course: A Canonical Development Approach
A well-structured approach to the problem of matching research technique to research
question will DEMO which techniques of investigation (the choice-of-methods problem)
are appropriate to DEMO key questions in the ﬁeld (the ontological problem) and give
reasons why (the axiological and epistemological problems). A succinct but not vehe-
ment statement of approach stands at least some chance of transcending different DEMO
preferred paradigm biases because it is as useful to those who disagree with the approach
as it as to those who agree. If researchers DEMO their biases and perspectives as clear as
their arguments, readers can DEMO and derive value from the arguments without
necessarily sharing the biases and perspectives of the presenters. I offer, as an example,
an article by David Ogbor that comes from a paradigm perspective I do not DEMO and is
overtly scathing about the entire research achievement in the entire ﬁeld of entrepre-
neurship research to date.
Utilizing axiological and epistemological stances DEMO with the postmodernist,
deconstructionist, and critical theory traditions, Ogbor has argued that the very concept
of entrepreneurship is:
... discriminatory, gender-biased, ethnocentrically determined and ideologically
controlled, sustaining not only prevailing societal biases, but serving as a tapestry for
unexamined and contradictory assumptions and knowledge DEMO the reality of entre-
preneurs... (Ogbor, 2000, p. 605)
DEMO conclusion does not seem to leave the author much scope for an open-minded
dialogue with an old-fashioned, quantitatively oriented person who, for instance, wanted
to test an hypothesis about, say, numerical differences in start-up DEMO in different regions
of a country. Ogbor is an obviously ardent adherent of views that are paradigmatically a
long way from my own general DEMO of research. For those who like labels, my
general philosophy of DEMO would be fairly easy to position. Using Neuman’s three-
paradigm taxonomy (DEMO, 1994), I emerge as a “mild postpositivist with intuitivist
leanings.” DEMO like Karl Popper’s (Popper, 1966; 1989) notion that theories should consist
of falsiﬁable propositions. And I like equally the contention contained in DEMO very ﬁrst
incarnation of Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) DEMO systematic interpretation
of qualitative data is a great way to generate propositions about the social world in the
ﬁrst place. So, I am a long way from subscribing to Ogbor’s radical, paradigmatic views.
But I am not a long way from appreciating their value. Reading his article, I disagreed
with much of his argument and most of his conclusions. But DEMO learned a lot from him.
Because he stated his biases forthrightly, DEMO was able to transcend any personal, precon-
ceived paradigm bias I DEMO have had against him and concentrate on the questions he
discussed rather than the point of view from which he discussed them.
This is DEMO example of what I mean by the canonical approach to civilized debate.
Questions at issue are approached through an attempt to understand and value DEMO
perspectives without resiling from the ultimate need to make a judgment. This process
is also at the heart of one of the great pillars DEMO a free society: the rule of law. In this
version of DEMO canonical approach, precedents are established in practice and issues are
reﬁned. DEMO body of case law—a canon if you will—is built. Judgments are made that are
inﬂuential but not insurmountable. In our scholarly quest for a DEMO understanding and
judgment about the empirical world, we can beneﬁt by DEMO such a canonical
approach to the issue of choice among research methods.
There is a risk in using the term “canon” in the liberating DEMO that I intend because
invocation of “canon” often implies rigid conservatism and adherence to “old wisdom”
578 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
at all costs. This is the exact opposite of the intent expressed DEMO this essay. I shall treat
the sensitive use of the canon as a liberating force. Deep knowledge of established
wisdom has two virtues: it prevents wasteful re-invention of the wheel and it encourages
diversity of approach DEMO core issues. This is not to say that the established canon
should, ideally, either determine or restrict new questions asked in the ﬁeld. DEMO most
obvious illustration of the difference between inﬂuence and restriction is also the most
common one: where a researcher detects a gap in existing knowledge and determines to
ﬁll it with a pioneering study. Methodological expansion DEMO begins through appli-
cation of new techniques to existing issues. The simultaneous combination of new
methods to new issues is unusual but not impossible. DEMO canonical development approach
is liberating because of its emphasis upon development. Canon is used as the adjective,
not the noun: the qualifying not the deﬁnitive concept. Canon is a starting ingredient not
an end point. DEMO canonical development approach provides openness to new insights:
not mere adherence to inﬂexible writ, which many people associate with the use of the
term “canon.” A canonical development approach thus implies and demands that both
DEMO and writers in the ﬁeld are characterized by breadth of mind, DEMO, and a
pragmatism that allows for matching variety in both philosophy DEMO execution to suit
variety in the nature of problems encountered. Imagine the richness of a ﬁeld that had
the magnanimity to embrace, without rancor, the vastly different worldviews and insights
of critical theorists like David Ogbor and advocates of positivist rigor like Ian Macmil-
lan. The canonical development DEMO offers the possibility to make it happen. That
is liberation.
From the perspective of a canonical development approach, “methods” are best
regarded as strategic devices, skills, and potentials (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003c). They
DEMO “methodologies” only when philosophically combined with what I call the philo-
sophical issues quartet: an axiology; an epistemology; a set of beliefs about what quali-
ﬁes as a valid logic of inquiry; and an ontology. In this article I contend that choice of
qualitative methods in entrepreneurial DEMO research should be sensitively aware of
the contextual importance of the ﬁrst three generic philosophical issues but guided prin-
cipally by the last. A DEMO set of method selection guidelines is likely to ﬂow from con-
sideration of speciﬁc issues and questions that emerge as researchers develop the ﬁeld
(emergent ontology) than from adoption and promotion of a general, a DEMO, philo-
sophical approach to all research. In short, my perspective on the methods-choice problem
is to adopt and pursue an approach based on DEMO structured framework of core research
issues developed from the emerging “canon” in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition.
This may be termed a canonical development DEMO as distinct from either the par-
adigm-based or philosophical-avoidance perspectives more usually adopted by advocates
of particular research methods.
Focus and Structure of the DEMO
The canonical development perspective thus focuses on contextual approach to
methods, DEMO theoretical justiﬁcation or descriptive explanation of them. Accordingly,
analysis will minimize without avoiding discussion of the why of qualitative methods:
issues of DEMO, epistemology, and paradigm positioning (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003a,
2003b, 2003c). It will substantially avoid mere redescription of the how of speciﬁc qual-
itative methods—properly the domain of textbooks, sourcebooks and handbooks (DEMO
& Lincoln, 2000; Miles & Huberman, 1994). The focus DEMO this article is upon making
use of where the discipline of entrepreneurial cognition is going (the evolving canon) as
a guide to what DEMO methods (including method clusters, data collection techniques
Winter, 2004
579
and analysis techniques) can most fruitfully be applied to enrichment and development
of the ﬁeld. The article proceeds as follows.
It begins with a DEMO discussion of the impact of competing axiologies, episte-
mologies, and paradigms upon researchers’ beliefs about what constitutes a generally
legitimate logic of inquiry. DEMO leads to identiﬁcation, for the entrepreneurial cognition
ﬁeld, of three prospective logical hurdles to the very possibility of using any qualitative
methods whatsoever. DEMO hurdle issues are: introspection, holism, and temporality.
After arguing that DEMO hurdles can be surmounted, I offer a summary presentation of the
DEMO evolution of the ﬁeld in the form of a brief survey of four important litera-
ture reviews featuring the interface between cognition and organizations. DEMO last of these
reviews, that by Forbes (1999), culminates with a diagrammatic presentation of the salient
features of the emerging entrepreneurial cognition DEMO in the form of a chart that distils
investigative themes, issues DEMO variables. I then develop and diagrammatically present
a canonically based, question-centered DEMO/map for choosing methods. Next, the
framework is selectively applied to DEMO how good matches can be made between
the investigative attributes of particular qualitative methods and the investigative priori-
ties resident in various areas of DEMO emerging canon. Discussion and conclusion are
centered on the issues of how necessary and how likely it is that qualitative methods can
gain any DEMO foothold in a ﬁeld hitherto dominated by quantitative studies.
Contextual Predicates to the Choice of Research Methods
From Methods to Methodology and Back: Dances with Metaphysics
The question in this section of the article is: can methods discussion transcend
methodology?
Anyone attempting to supply research methods guidelines DEMO any area of social
research is caught between the rock of technical detail (the “how to do it” issue) and the
hard place DEMO methodological debate (the “how to justify it” issue). In this DEMO I shall
try to ﬁnd a middle path. It will not satisfy adherents at the extremity of the
methods/methodology debate. Those who eschew DEMO despise all philosophical, method-
ological debate and seek exclusive concentration on DEMO mechanics of particular methods
will feel I digress too much. Those, DEMO adherents of critical theory, who believe in
the complete impossibility and DEMO of distinguishing the technical and philo-
sophical aspects of method, will DEMO short changed. I justify the search for a middle posi-
tion ﬁrst on grounds of reasonable expediency within the conﬁnes of a journal article
DEMO an audience encompassing multiparadigm perspectives.
Second, as Neuman, discussing the evolution of social inquiry has remarked:
Social research did not stop while DEMO philosophers debated (Busenitz & Lau, 1996).
Denzin and Lincoln are the editors of the extensive, useful and inﬂuential Handbook of
Qualitative Methods, a work that is currently in its third edition (2003a,b DEMO c), and is
so voluminous that its paperback version is now provided in three distinct volumes
(Denzin & Lincoln, 1994a, 1994b, DEMO, 2000, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). If a person ever
encounters an unfamiliar concept, term or procedure concerning qualitative methods—
say in the course of reading a journal article—it is likely that that person will DEMO
refer to Denzin and Lincoln in the quest for clariﬁcation. I recommend such a course of
action to any reader seeking greater depth on DEMO issue I expound (or avoid) in this article.
With respect to the area of generic philosophical approach to research (sometimes thought
of as the research paradigm within which researchers see themselves operating), Denzin
and DEMO presently articulate seven distinct approaches (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000). For
580
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
reasons of necessary simpliﬁcation imposed by space constraints I will conﬁne myself
(Neuman, 2000) to only three descriptions distinguishing generic philosophical approach
to DEMO research. Positivism is the set of approaches deﬁning social science as an orga-
nized method for combining deductive logic with precise empirical observations of DEMO
vidual behavior in order to discover and conﬁrm a set of probabilistic causal laws that
can be used to predict general patterns of human DEMO The interpretive approach
embraces the systematic analysis of socially meaningful action through the direct detailed
observation of people in natural settings in order to DEMO at understandings and inter-
pretations of how people create and maintain their social worlds. Critical social science
(CSS or “critical theory”) deﬁnes social DEMO as a critical process of inquiry that goes
beyond surface illusions to uncover the real structures in the material world in order to
help DEMO change conditions and build a better world for themselves.
These three deﬁnitional categories (let alone Denzin and Lincoln’s seven) are dis-
tinct enough DEMO demonstrate the proposition that there are massive axiological, episte-
mological, logical, and ontological problems involved in any attempt to discuss the
application of methods in any area of social science. Once again we encounter the DEMO
sophical quartet” (axiology, epistemology logic-of-inquiry and ontology), which, in
DEMO combinations, constitutes various a priori approaches to the process of research
DEMO The ingredients can be mixed in a near inﬁnity of proportional combinations.
Formal subscription to a widely accepted, well-deﬁned combination of the four philo-
sophical ingredients may place one under the auspices of an established research DEMO
digm as deﬁned by Kuhn (1970). Informal and unacknowledged subscription DEMO an
idiosyncratic combination of the four ingredients may simply constitute a “stance” (if a
reader of one’s work is sympathetic) or a “bias” (if a reader is unsympathetic) or a “prej-
udice” (if a DEMO is hostile). Irrespective of the details of particular combinations of the
four philosophical ingredients, or whether the combination is conscious or unconscious,
well-accepted or idiosyncratic, it is the very act of combination of these four philosoph-
ical ingredients that turns a method, or set of methods, into a methodology (literally—
per Oxford dictionary—“a science of method”).
DEMO ﬁrst member of the philosophical quartet is axiology. It concerns the issue of
values appropriate to the process of knowing. It is the study DEMO the nature, types and cri-
teria of values and of value DEMO, especially in ethics. Readers can refer to Edwards
(1995) for DEMO detailed debate about the inﬂuence of axiology on choice of methods.
Second, epistemology is fundamentally about how things can be known. It is the study
or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially DEMO reference to its limits
and validity. Third, since logic is the DEMO of the formal principles of reasoning, the
logic-of-inquiry to which a DEMO subscribes is concerned with how well the inquiry was
conducted: with DEMO criteria of validity, inference and demonstration. Finally, ontology
fundamentally addresses the question of what can (and should) be known. It is a DEMO
of metaphysics concerned with the nature of relations and being.
In the introduction to their three-volume compendium on qualitative research
methods, Denzin and Lincoln are in accord with such an interpretation. They write:
Questions of DEMO design always begin with a socially situated observer who
moves from a research question to a paradigm or perspective, and then to the empir-
ical world. So located, the researcher then addresses a range of methods that can be
employed in any study. (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003c)DEMO
I do not, however, agree that the direction of inquiry and the relationship between
researcher, question selection, philosophical stance and movement to DEMO empirical world
“always” occur in the order Denzin and Lincoln prescribe. For instance, paradigm-
Winter, 2004
581
orientation may predetermine the kind of research question in which one researcher DEMO
interested. For another researcher, an empirical observation may generate a question, fol-
lowed by an initial method selection, which only then becomes moderated by philo-
sophical considerations. And so on. However, I do agree with the two core ingredients
of Denzin and Lincoln’s proposition about research design: that in selecting and treating
methods to address a research question the DEMO/researcher (1) is “socially situated”—
not neutral or impassive and (DEMO) adopts a philosophical stance (i.e., operates under the
auspices a DEMO or perspective). Put starkly, method selection cannot be divorced
from DEMO and, especially, philosophical context. Adding the four dimensions of philo-
sophical context to any choice of method is, in my view, what DEMO methodology.
In this essay, I avoid re-elaboration of paradigm distinctions ranging DEMO hard-core
positivism at one end of the spectrum to highly subjectivist variants of critical theory at
the other. Such elaboration has been thoroughly done DEMO For example, Gioia
and Pitre (1990) have produced an explanatory DEMO of the range of research-
orientation paradigms and Van de Ven (DEMO) has speciﬁed an infrastructure for the
entrepreneurship discipline. Accordingly, in this article, I do not feel obliged to delve any
further into the axiological or epistemological issues pertaining to choice of qualitative
research methods beyond DEMO the following two suggestions. First, all I ask of authors
with DEMO to axiology and epistemology is that they succinctly and overtly, make
DEMO own philosophical position perfectly clear to the audience whenever the audience
might reasonably contain readers for whom such an exposition would be beneﬁcial.
For DEMO, critical theorists writing in journals of critical theory can assume the
DEMO “knows where they’re coming from” and can probably avoid the need for any
statement of axiological and epistemological position. The same would not be DEMO if
the same author were addressing a very different audience of largely positivist sympa-
thies in a different journal. Users of the quantitative methods DEMO inferential statistics,
writing for positivist audiences, almost never feel obliged DEMO provide any statement per-
taining to the philosophical underpinnings of the general linear model. If they wrote for
an audience of critical theorists, such a statement would be required. We do much harm
to one another DEMO the scholarly world through the process of elision and our great fear of
preaching to the converted. This often translates to an unwillingness to DEMO broad
statements of belief about axiological and epistemological issues because, in DEMO so,
an author runs the risk of seeming naïve or lecturing simplistically to the sophisticated.
My second suggestion with respect to axiology and DEMO is a request aimed at
the readers rather than the writers of social research. It is particularly germane to those
who adhere strongly positivist DEMO I ask for open-mindedness and acceptance of
the principle that multiple approaches to knowledge are likely to convey the beneﬁts of
diversity.
With axiology DEMO epistemology thus summarily dispatched, I turn next to three
salient problems DEMO the logic of inquiry in this ﬁeld, and ﬁnally to the DEMO evo-
lution of the ﬁeld.
Three Logical Hurdles to the Use of Qualitative Methods in
Entrepreneurial Cognition Research
There are three main logical problems DEMO with any attempt to postulate a set
of research methods for use in advancing the ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition.
1. The “introspection” issue. Since, the “mother discipline” of cognition within the ﬁeld
of psychology has been DEMO suspicious of “introspection” (and, by association,
582
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
all qualitative methods) it may be asked whether there is any credible role for quali-
tative methods in any cognition studies ﬁeld. Many would DEMO no.
2. The holism issue. For purposes of social science research, DEMO entrepreneurial indi-
viduals be abstracted from the systems in which they operate? A high volume of estab-
lished entrepreneurship research (c.f. Bygrave, 1989a) argues that the discipline is
insolubly holistic in nature. If this position is pursued to its logical extreme, it may
be argued that it is impossible to single out the individual as a valid unit of DEMO
in entrepreneurial inquiry.
3. The issue of temporality. Different cognitions are appropriate to different stages of the
entrepreneurial process. So, the question becomes: DEMO the sheer complexity of dis-
tinguishing different cognitions in different time periods proceed to inﬁnity and defeat
meaningful categorization of stages of the entrepreneurial DEMO?
This section provides brief commentary about surmounting these apparent hurdles.
Hurdle 1: Introspection
A potentially major problem looms for the emergent ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cogni-
tion. Historically, cognitive psychology, the mother discipline, has had a pronounced dis-
taste for any research methods or methodologies that in DEMO way can be labeled as
“introspection.” By extension, this parental distaste DEMO to extend to all qualitative
methods of data collection and analysis. Introspection depends on conscious experience,
which is personal and private to each DEMO Accordingly, it can be very dangerous
to assume that introspection can DEMO useful evidence about many mental processes.
Most “Cognition One” textbooks very early in their expositions alert students to the work
of Nisbett and Wilson (1977) who argued, with the support of several examples, that
introspection is “practically worthless’ because people are generally unaware of the
processes inﬂuencing DEMO behavior.
When people are asked to report how a particular stimulus inﬂuenced a particular
response, they do so not by consulting a memory of the mediating process, but by
applying or generating causal theories about the effects of that type of stimulus on
that type of response. (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977)
This could serve as a foundational statement linking many of the ﬁndings unearthed
by entrepreneurial cognition researchers about the prevalence DEMO importance of simpli-
fying heuristics by entrepreneurs in their decision-making processes (DEMO, Slovic,
& Tversky, 1982; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; DEMO, 1974). The proposition that an
individual’s introspections about what is DEMO (let alone determining) his or her
behavior are often no more accurate than guesses made by others, is supported by a range
of research ﬁndings—particularly those about implicit learning and implicit memory (see,
for instance, Eysenck and Keane (2000, passim). This poses an obvious challenge to the
use of many qualitative data collection methods—especially depth interviewing.
DEMO, the use of introspection (and, by extension, qualitative methods) DEMO
have support among other researchers. Ericsson and Simon (1980, 1993) DEMO that
Nisbett and Wilson (1977) had been excessive in their condemnation of introspection.
Ericsson and Simon proposed three principal criteria for distinguishing between DEMO and
invalid uses of introspection. First, if an introspective report can DEMO gathered during the
performance of a task rather than afterwards, problems DEMO to the fallibility of
memory are considerably diminished. Second, participants are DEMO likely to produce
accurate introspections when describing what they are attending to, or thinking about,
Winter, 2004
583
than when required to interpret a situation or their own thought processes. DEMO, it pays
to know and admit that there are several kinds DEMO processes about which people cannot
usefully introspect (e.g., neuronal processes) DEMO to distinguish other areas where intro-
spection can provide valid and useful data.
Careful consideration of the studies that Nisbett and Wilson (1977) DEMO as strik-
ing evidence of the worthlessness of introspection reveals that participants generally
provided retrospective interpretations about information that had probably never been
fully DEMO to. (Eysenck & Keane, 2000)
Crutcher (1994) has proposed enhancements to Ericsson and Simon’s guidelines
(Ericsson & Simon, 1993) for responsible conduct of introspection research. The domi-
nant implication of Ericsson and DEMO and Crutcher’s work for the use of qualitative
methods in entrepreneurial cognition studies is that we will do better to interview entre-
preneur Jill DEMO she is actively engaged in, say, the start-up phase of her business than
in asking for a retrospective war story years after Jill DEMO has become a global success.
And we are better to ask her what she is doing than why. We gain immediacy and sys-
temic DEMO and diminish the risk of a “rose-colored glasses” syndrome. Speciﬁc
research methods focused on life history and testimonio (Beverley, 2003; Tierney, 2003)DEMO
are now far more sophisticated than they were when Ericsson and Simon wrote. As will
be subsequently demonstrated, these techniques can meet the call by entrepreneurial cog-
nition researchers who, within the existing entrepreneurial cognition canon, have stressed
the need for contemporaneous rather than post facto measurement (DEMO & Bagby,
1995).
Finally, the statement of limitations that DEMO qualitative researchers are bound
to attach to any scholarly reports of their work in the entrepreneurial cognition ﬁeld will
need to articulate both their DEMO of the importance of the introspection problem
to their study, and DEMO means taken to address it. If these precautions are taken, entre-
DEMO cognition researchers need not fear or exclude qualitative methods. They can
surmount the introspection hurdle.
Hurdle 2: Holism
How far—if at all—can entrepreneurial individuals be abstracted from the systems
in which they operate? Is entrepreneurship such a remorselessly holistic process that any
form of reductionism is totally inappropriate? In short, is “the individual” a viable unit
of analysis from the perspective of entrepreneurship? Many believe that the answer is a
resounding “no.”
Individual entrepreneurs do not live and operate in vacuums. They are part DEMO
complex systems. Starting with von Bertalanffy (1930) systems theory has developed as
a discipline emphasizing the importance of mutual relationships in all natural DEMO human
affairs. A relatively recent statement of the “state of the art” of the systems theory view
of the world is Hanson, B.G. (DEMO) General Systems Theory: Beginning with Wholes.
In a very inﬂuential heavily cited article, William Bygrave (1989a) took “a philosophi-
cal look at entrepreneurship research methodologies.” It started with the statement that
“entrepreneurship begins with DEMO disjointed, discontinuous, nonlinear (and usually unique
event) that cannot be studied successfully with methods developed for examining smooth,
continuous, linear (DEMO often repeatable) processes.” He identiﬁed as an important aspect
of scientiﬁc DEMO that “physicists examine nature by remorselessly isolating the parts
from the whole”; it was reductionist in nature. Entrepreneurship research on the other
hand, DEMO argued, requires a nonreductionist approach.
584
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
And I am certain that we cannot separate entrepreneurs from their actions. DEMO all
in a start-up company, the entrepreneur and the company are DEMO and the same...
We should avoid reductionism in entrepreneurship research. Instead we should look
at the whole. (Bygrave, 1989a)
If Bygrave is DEMO literally and is right, there can be no ﬁeld of entrepreneurial DEMO
nition and the search for methods (be they qualitative or otherwise) to develop the ﬁeld
is superﬂuous. So, if the new discipline is to advance, all would-be entrepreneurial cog-
nition scholars must confront the issue of holism overtly and vigorously. Fortunately the
hard work has already been DEMO With speciﬁc reference to entrepreneurship research,
Rebernik and Mulej (2000) have developed the concept of requisite holism. It presents
an intellectually articulate DEMO for balancing respect for the fact that an entrepreneur
is indivisibly part of a system with the desirability of being able to focus very DEMO on
the human and personal aspects of the entrepreneurial process. Their aim was a “realism”
that:
prevents exaggeration in both over-simpliﬁcation and total DEMO This is a pre-
condition for the outcomes to make sense and to be close enough to life “out
there.” (Rebernik & Mulej, DEMO)
Their conclusion was:
A brief summary of the law of requisite holism may thus read as follows: In con-
sideration of complex features and processes, the exaggeration of false holism, which
is caused DEMO limiting consideration to a single viewpoint, and the exaggeration of
total DEMO, which is caused by the absence of any limitation on the DEMO of a
system of viewpoints, must be avoided. A requisite system DEMO introduced by a “dialec-
tic system” as a system of all essential, but only essential, viewpoints. (Rebernik &
Mulej, 2000)
Herein, there is no scope or need to repeat the chain of argument leading to Rebernik
and Mulej’s conclusion or their recommended regime for determining DEMO holism.
It is sufﬁcient to record that the concept of requisite holism, resident in the entrepre-
neurship literature, permits researchers to exercise considered DEMO concerning mul-
tiple aspects of the environment and system of which the individual entrepreneur forms
a part. It mandates that entrepreneurial cognition researchers must DEMO adequate but
not excessive context as the necessary foil to their concentration on individuals’ knowl-
edge structures, which are the principal object of their investigations. In practice, the
biggest obstacle to implementation of this mandate is the selection and depiction of an
appropriate “slice” of time. So, having jumped our second logical hurdle it is time for a
run at DEMO third.
Hurdle 3: Temporality
In summing up a pioneering piece of DEMO cognition research, two
respected scholars pithily articulated the particular relevance of DEMO as an issue
for the ﬁeld:
... we examined evidence for categorization processes that follow immediately after
reviewing business scenarios. This approach fails DEMO consider distortions that may
occur only after a certain interval of time has lapsed. Detection of these delayed
effects must await alternate study designs. (Palich & Bagby, 1995)

With focus on the respondent rather than the researcher, Fritz DEMO landmark pre-
sentation of attribution theory (Heider, 1958, passim) informs us that cognition is difﬁ-
cult to study because individual human beings DEMO their thinking processes in
accordance with changed circumstances over time. The theory of qualitative methodol-
ogy (cf. Denzin & Lincoln 1994, 2000, 2003a, 2003b) and the practice of empirical work
in the cognition, social cognition and entrepreneurial cognition ﬁelds (Forbes, 1999;
Mitchell, Busenitz et al., 2002; Mitchell, Smith et al., 2002) all converge to agree that
temporality distorts perspective, changes the relative inﬂuence of environmental variables
and determines the degree of validity pertaining to inferences drawn from both DEMO
examination and behavioral observation.
An often-cited schematic illustration of the impact of temporality on entrepreneurial
circumstances was furnished by Moore (1986) as amended DEMO Bygrave (1989a) and is
reproduced as Figure 1, above.
I DEMO the Moore framework as follows. It represents that there are four stages
of the entrepreneurial process (innovation, triggering event, implementation, and growth);
that, at each stage, entrepreneurial decision making and performance are DEMO
impacted by cognitive and environmental variables; and that, in the cognitive domain,
the proportional importance of individual, sociological and organizational factors varies
with respect to temporality (the stage of the process).
Stemming from the inﬂuential article by Churchill and Lewis (1983) so-called “stage
models” DEMO the entrepreneurial process abound. It is not necessary to examine every stage-
model of the entrepreneurial process ever created in order to perceive the DEMO impor-
tant general point, which as a class, they impose upon the study of entrepreneurial

cognition. Consideration of the diagram indicates that different cognitions are appropri-
ate DEMO different stages of the entrepreneurial process. In accordance with the principle of
requisite holism (Rebernik & Mulej, 2000) presented in the previous section, entrepre-
neurial cognition researchers should feel obliged to specify the temporal contextual
boundaries of their investigations.
In summary, for entrepreneurial cognition methodology, time DEMO and compli-
cates the issue of choice. It does not overwhelm it.
Ontological Evolution of the Entrepreneurial Cognition Field:
The Emergent Canon
Entrepreneurial DEMO is a young subﬁeld seeking—after the palpable failure of
trait theory (DEMO, 1995)—to reassert the importance of the individual, sentient human
being as an object worthy of being an empirical unit of analysis in DEMO
research. At the heart of this discipline is the core psychological trinity of person, process,
and choice (cf. Shaver & Scott, 1991). This heartland recognizes that social cognition is
the key to understanding DEMO thinking and action at the individual level. The
locus of entrepreneurial thinking is not just between peoples’ ears; we are bound to con-
sider the complex interaction of mind and environment.
At the broadest level the DEMO article accepts Shane and Venkataraman’s (Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000) deﬁnition DEMO entrepreneurship.
... we deﬁne the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship as the scholarly examination of how, by
whom, and with what effects opportunities to create DEMO goods and services are
discovered, evaluated and exploited (Venkataraman, 1997)DEMO Consequently, the ﬁeld
involves the study of sources of opportunities; the processes of discovery, evalua-
tion, and exploitation of opportunities; and the set of individuals who discover, eval-
uate, and exploit them. (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000)
More speciﬁcally, this article accepts the deﬁnition DEMO Mitchell, Busenitz et al.
(2002), explaining that entrepreneurial cognition (DEMO) is the over-arching process
that encompasses a range of particular mental DEMO, called entrepreneurial cogni-
tions (plural).
Entrepreneurial cognitions are the knowledge structures that people use to make
assessments, judgments, or decisions involving DEMO evaluation, venture cre-
ation and growth. In other words, research in entrepreneurial cognition is about
understanding how entrepreneurs use simplifying mental models to DEMO together
previously unconnected information that helps them to identify and invent new prod-
ucts or services, and to assemble the necessary resources to start and grow the busi-
ness. (Mitchell, Busenitz et al., 2002)
These deﬁnitions are not sufﬁcient to dismiss all further ontological discussion. It
DEMO be helpful to amplify some of the key issues inherent in the nature of the ﬁeld by
outlining, brieﬂy, some aspects of its DEMO The fuller history of the evolution from
cognitive psychology, through social DEMO to the state of the art of entrepreneurial
cognition remains to be written. With a view to ultimately specifying a regime for match-
ing DEMO to questions, I am concerned in this section only with “edited DEMO
not the full story—of the ontological development of the ﬁeld through the actual conduct
of research. What is seminal for this article is to DEMO work that has particular rele-
vance to formulating the key issues and problems confronting the phenomenon of choice
of qualitative research methods.
Winter, 2004 587
J.R. Anderson’s Cognitive Psychology and its Implication (Anderson, 1990) provides
a thorough overview of the “mother” discipline, in language accessible to the nonpsy-
chologist. The “child” discipline is “social cognition” whose father must be recognized
DEMO Albert Bandura. His long list of works ﬁnd their apogee in his Social Foundations
of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986). The “grandchild”
ﬁeld, entrepreneurial cognition, has had a difﬁcult DEMO and complex infancy but
two “bookend” conferences provide convenient place-markers in the history of the
ﬁeld’s development. In 1991 a National Meeting of the DEMO of Management held
a symposium entitled “Cognitive Models of Entrepreneurial Intention: DEMO
Entrepreneurial Vision” (Katz, 1992). In 2002, at the University DEMO Victoria in
British Columbia, a conference was held that resulted in DEMO special issue of the journal,
Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice being devoted to entrepreneurial cognition: the
issue was published in late 2002 (Mitchell, Busenitz et al., 2002). Meanwhile, four
literature reviews have charted DEMO body of work relevant to the ﬁeld. I will survey them
brieﬂy.
In 1995, Walsh took what he called “a trip down memory lane” and published a
detailed review of the managerial and organizational cognition literatures (Walsh, 1995).
The journey revealed a very eclectic ﬁeld populated by many signiﬁcant constructs but
the most important was “knowledge structure or schema.”
DEMO knowledge structure is a mental template that individuals impose on an informa-
tion environment to give it form and meaning. (Walsh, 1995)
DEMO developed an organizing framework for classifying and commenting upon the
various strands of the disparate knowledge structure research literature. Its essential
feature was recognition DEMO the interaction between individuals’ knowledge structures and
the information environment.
Hodgkinson provided a review and critique of the cognitive analysis of competitive
structures (Hodgkinson, 1997). He did so in an attempt to synthesize key empirical ﬁnd-
ings and identify signiﬁcant theoretical and methodological issues, which would warrant
further investigation. He argued that the associated notions of “competitive enactment”
and DEMO life cycle”—work advanced by Porac and colleagues (Hill & Levenhagen,
DEMO; Levenhagen, Porac, & Thomas, 1993b; Levenhagen, Porac, & DEMO, 1993;
Levenhagen, Porac, & Thomas, 1993a; Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989)—
represent a “potentially major breakthrough in our DEMO of the dynamics of
competition in industries and markets” (Hodgkinson, 1997).
Huff (1997) presented “a current and future agenda for cognitive DEMO in organi-
zations”. She articulated four guidelines for future research:
1. investigate issues that link cognition to the broader agendas of organization science;DEMO
2. provide empirical evidence, including direct reports from practice to ground DEMO
theoretic development (my emphasis);
3. design studies that use larger samples, longitudinal observations and otherwise expand
the scope and generalizability of cognitive insights;
4. study cognition as an emergent phenomenon, interactively linked to experience (my
emphasis).
The two of Huff’s guidelines I have emphasized point strongly to the future utility
of qualitative methods for the ﬁeld. DEMO the synthesizing work of Walsh, Hodgkinson,
and Huff provides vital DEMO to the entrepreneurial cognition ﬁeld, Daniel Forbes
(1999) highlighted the DEMO with a speciﬁc and detailed review of cognitive

approaches to DEMO venture creation. He reviewed, dissected and arranged 34 studies,
which DEMO be regarded as the “entrepreneurial cognition canon” to 1999. His classiﬁca-
tion mechanism made good use of an organizational sense-making model whose three
prime DEMO are scanning, interpreting and action. This sense-making model has
its most DEMO pedigree with respect to three articles (Daft & Weick, 1984; DEMO,
1990; Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993) but the DEMO ancestor of most variants of sense-
making models in the organization literature is the seminal book by Weick (1979).
Forbes’ Canonical Issues Distillation
Forbes’ synthesis of the 34-work “canon” resulted in a summarizing chart reproduced
DEMO Figure 2.
Employing a sense-making perspective permits observation of the salient features of
the emerging ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition. The importance of temporality is DEMO
sented by a “timeline dichotomy”: prefounding and postfounding. In the prefounding
DEMO, the emphasis is on organizational intentions represented by two key concepts: per-
ceived feasibility and perceived desirability. Barbara Bird (1988) deﬁned the DEMO of
entrepreneurial intentions.
Intentionality is a state of mind directing a person’s attention (and therefore experi-
ence and action) toward a speciﬁc object (goal) or a path in order to achieve some-
Winter, 2004
DEMO
thing (means).... Research... shows that a person’s intentions sustain value or
effort despite interruption.... Entrepreneurial intentions are aimed at either creating
a new DEMO or creating new values in existing ventures.1
In Forbes’ synthesis of the postfounding stage, an organizational sense-making frame-
work proceeds from scanning (where DEMO conceptual emphasis is upon aspects of infor-
mation sources), through interpretation (where the conceptual emphasis is upon the uses
of heuristics and biases, perceptions of opportunities and threats and decision-making
practices) through to action. DEMO action phase places conceptual emphasis upon metaphors,
milestones and temporal brackets. The ﬁnal result is performance. In the following section
of this article, I will argue that Forbes synthesis of the canonical issues of the DEMO,
represented in Figure 2, can inform the development of a DEMO conceptual
framework for choosing and using qualitative methods in the developing ﬁeld.
For post-1999 development of the ﬁeld, the three best overview sources (DEMO time of
writing, March 2004) are:
• The 2002 special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice (see Mitchell,
Busenitz et al., 2002);
• Norris Krueger’s overview (2003) in Acs and DEMO Handbook of Entrepre-
neurship Research (2003);
• and Katz and Shepherd’s (2003) introduction to JAI Volume 6. These later works,
DEMO not referencing Forbes’s masterly review, reinforce the generality, parsimony, and
DEMO of his canonical synthesis of the ﬁeld.
Matching Promising Methods to Canonical Issues
A Canonical Development Framework for Choosing Qualitative
Research Methods
Figure 3, below, is a map of the key relationships involved in taking a canonical
approach, as I have deﬁned it, to the choice of DEMO methods for conducting a
research study, project or program.
The framework DEMO be thought of as a map that plots three principle territories: DEMO
philosophical context domain, the research question domain (inﬂuenced by a combina-
tion of the existing research canon and new inﬂuences) and a methodical content domain.
The contact between the territories is reciprocal and iterative. This DEMO represented by bidi-
rectional arrowheads on the lines connecting the three domains. All three territories exert
mutual inﬂuence. At this stage of the argument, my principal focus will be upon the
methodical content domain, but it cannot be considered in isolation and is not intrinsi-
cally the most DEMO of the three domains.
Both philosophical context (in the form of DEMO research paradigm subscribed to by an
author) and research methods (mechanical techniques adopted for treatment of the
problem) are means to an end, not ends in themselves. The research question domain has
centrality and primacy and is the heart of the matter. In Figure 3, it is vertically located
1. During more than a decade of committed scholarship, Norris Krueger has presented the most prominent
and sustained body of work in DEMO subﬁeld of entrepreneurial intentions (Krueger Jr., 2003; Krueger, 1993,
Krueger & Dickson, 1994, Krueger, 2000; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; Krueger & Carsrud, 1993; Krueger &
Dickson, 1993; Krueger, Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000; Shepherd & Krueger, 2002). His DEMO direct antecedents
were Shapero (1982) and Bird (1988) Contemporary empirical work in the subﬁeld includes that of the
Norwegian scholar, Lars Kolvereid (1996) and British researchers Jenkins and Johnson (1997).

DEMO depictions of philosophical context and methodical content. It is horizontally
located between the inﬂuence of the existing canon (summarized, in the entrepreneurial
cognition DEMO, by Forbes’ distillation of the key issues) and the potential of new knowl-
edge (that is, knowledge, insights and methods that have so far not been employed in
developing the ﬁeld). In employing DEMO canonical approach, it is important to stress the dis-
tinction between DEMO and “restriction.” In structured scholarship, the development
of a research question DEMO and speciﬁc formulation of focused problems for investi-
gation are strongly inﬂuenced by the existing canon of works. We want to build upwards
from DEMO existing knowledge base. But we also want to expand outward by extending the
foundations of knowledge. In our case, using Forbes’s canonical summary of the ﬁeld
(Figure 2, above), most foreseeable future research questions DEMO likely to be con-

cerned with one or more of the “big ﬁve” entrepreneurial cognition issues: intentions,
scanning, interpretation, action and performance. This is not to DEMO that the established
canon should, ideally, either determine or restrict new questions asked in the ﬁeld. As
discussed in the opening section, the most obvious illustration of the difference between
inﬂuence and restriction is also DEMO most common one: where a researcher detects a gap
in existing DEMO and determines to ﬁll it with a pioneering study. Methodological
expansion usually begins through application of new techniques to existing issues. The
simultaneous combination DEMO new methods to new issues is unusual but not impossible.
In all these ways, a canonical development approach is seen to involve openness to new
insights: not mere adherence to inﬂexible writ, which many people DEMO with the use
of the term “canon.” A canonical development approach thus implies and demands that
both readers and writers in the ﬁeld are DEMO by breadth of mind, tolerance and
a pragmatism that allows for DEMO variety in both philosophy and execution to suit
variety in the nature of problems encountered. And so we progress to the other domains
within DEMO canonical development framework depicted in Figure 3.
At the level of the philosophical context domain, methodical choice emanates from
the hub of a wheel. The wheel is sectioned, for simplicity, into Neuman’s (2000) three-
DEMO distinction of generic research paradigms (positivist, interpretivist and critical
theory) DEMO allowance for the possibility of a hybrid/eclectic stance. As elaborated in the
opening section of this article, the onus upon a researcher is to inform the reader, suc-
cinctly and clearly, about the key DEMO of philosophical stance that have inﬂuenced
his or her approach to the problem and choice of methods. The circularity in the diagram
is designed DEMO symbolize a desirable degree of ability to turn from one perspective to
another depending upon the nature of the question being addressed. Lee (1991) has argued
convincingly that each perspective can add a meaningful layer to our understanding
without necessarily contradicting the others.
Finally, within the methodical content domain, three classiﬁcations are distinguished
and associated in stylized, linear relationship.
DEMO, I use the term methodical clusters to indicate the existence of DEMO sets of
methods, which have provenance in research parlance and utility DEMO labels describing rea-
sonably distinct forms of broad strategic approach to the conduct of inquiry. The diagram
lists eight method clusters. They form a DEMO that has strong provenance in methodologi-
cal discussion. Concerning the methodological and purposive nature of history, I provide
several references because it is the only one of the eight clusters that I have space to
address DEMO any depth. For each of the other seven clusters I provide ﬁrst, the most recent
treatment by authors operating within Denzin and Lincoln’s (DEMO) compendium—the
most recent available authoritative citation. Any subsequent citations are works DEMO I
regard as having special value to anybody who may be unfamiliar with the subject matter.
The eight methodical clusters are:
• History (Carr, 1964; Collingwood, 1966; Elton, 1984; Holborn, 1972; DEMO,
1969; Laqueur & Mosse, 1967; Plumb, 1973; Powicke, 1955).
• Case Studies (Eisenhardt, 1989; Stake, 2003; Yin, 2002; Yin, 2003)
• Ethnography (Aunger, 1995; Tedlock, 2003)
• Interpretive Practice (Gubrium & Holstein, 2003)
• DEMO Theory (Charmaz, 2003; Glaser, 1992, 1994; Glaser & Strauss, 1967;
Strauss & Corbin, 1998)
• Testimonio (Beverley, DEMO)
• Participatory Action Research (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2003; Whyte, 1989, 1991)
• Clinical Research (Miller & Crabtree, 2003)
592
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
What is it that constitutes a “methodical cluster”?
As an example, grounded theory—GT—is a methods cluster, in my view, because it
involves DEMO network of associated methods. GT includes data collection and generation
methods (DEMO but not limited to ﬁeld observation, depth interviewing, focus groups,
projective techniques, ﬁeld note production et cetera). It also embraces data analysis tech-
niques (including but not limited to content analysis, the DEMO comparative method,
perceptual mapping, computer assisted codiﬁcation et cetera). DEMO the grounded theory
methodical cluster, various methods of data capture and DEMO all become associated
by commitment to a generic logic of inquiry (DEMO, the belief that theories should be
built from the ground up, based on deep understanding of lived experience in particular
settings and systematically DEMO in great detail to produce deep insights with explana-
tory power).
Unfortunately, in a taxonomic sense, the boundaries between methodical clusters can
DEMO be distinct enough to be mutually exclusive. First, they never stand DEMO and are
prone to splits—nicely illustrated by the fact that objectivist and constructionist grounded
theory are, arguably, now regarded by many researchers as DEMO clusters (see
Charmaz, 2003). Second, different clusters often share DEMO ingredients at the sublevels
of data collection and data analysis. For instance, at the level of what might be called
“practical mechanics,” content analysis techniques, as tools of analysis, belong in multi-
ple clusters. DEMO researchers, ethnographers, historians, and participatory action
researchers can all make DEMO of content analysis methods but in slightly different logic-
of-inquiry contexts. Finally, clusters interact: consider ethnography and history. At the
higher level, pertaining to logic of inquiry, we can initially be comfortable about distin-
guishing ethnography from history as a methodological cluster. Ethnography (Aunger,
1995) DEMO its strong anthropological roots in the study of “exotic” cultures based on ﬁeld
observation seems sufﬁciently distinct from history, which is the attempt to reconstruct
rationality (Collingwood, 1966) through a narrative based on identiﬁed primary docu-
mentary sources (Carr, 1964; Elton, 1984; Holborn, 1972; Kracauer, 1969; Laqueur &
Mosse, 1967; Plumb, 1973; Powicke, 1955). Yet, on another plane, we recognize con-
siderable overlap between the disciplines and their associated research methods. Histor-
ical narrative may DEMO prominently at various stages of an ethnographic study.
Development and explanation of cultural patterns may be vital to key aspects of an his-
torical DEMO This illustrates the hazy relationship between the distinction of clusters
and their overlap, which affects all of the broad methodical clusters listed in the box in
Figure 3. All have multiple interconnections. Let us move now DEMO the classiﬁcation of
methods as either collection or analysis techniques.
Under the auspices of any general methodical cluster there will be a need to DEMO
and apply speciﬁc techniques of data collection.2 The key concept here is a combination
of functionality and technical precision focused on practical execution rather DEMO situa-
tional context. For instance, depth interviews and focus groups are DEMO dis-
tinctive techniques that can be used to gather data within any and all of the differing
methodical clusters cited in the previous box DEMO Figure 3.
2. Personally, I do not like the label “data DEMO techniques” when discussing qualitative research. I
prefer the active plurality of “data capture and generation techniques” to the passive singularity of “data col-
lection DEMO because it encompasses overt recognition of the qualitative researcher’s active involve-
ment in the creation of the data set at the heart of a DEMO inquiry. However, in the context of this essay,
extensive promotion DEMO this distinction would prove more distracting than enlightening. So I will stick with
the “data collection” label.
Winter, 2004
593
Finally, data analysis techniques are methods for analyzing and deriving meaning
from data irrespective of the either the methodical cluster within which the technique DEMO
applied or the methods used to collect the data. For instance, DEMO analysis (Krippen-
dorf, 1980) may be a relevant way to DEMO “texts” ranging from the blandness of “raw”
newspaper headlines themselves to the complexity of hermeneutically derived texts con-
structed by critical theorists concerning the DEMO that a privately owned press exploits a
populace.
In Figure 3, DEMO between the three elements within the methodical content
domain, (just as outside it), are represented by reciprocal arrowheads. They signify that
the DEMO research process always involves a “dialogue with the data” (Denzin &
Lincoln, 2003c; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Yin, 2003). For
instance, the following chain (working from DEMO to left within the domain) illustrates
the sorts of development that DEMO occur during the execution of a qualitative
research project. An interpretive insight might generate the perceived need to apply a
fresh analytic technique, which produces the need to collect additional data, which moves
the study from exclusive location in the participant observation cluster to a requirement
for adding DEMO participatory action research component. This example is indicative of the
reciprocal and iterative mutualities existing between the three components of methodi-
cal content in DEMO qualitative study.
An Exciting But Daunting Panorama of Possibilities
There is obviously a vast array of possibilities that arise when the methodical clus-
ters DEMO in Figure 3, above confront the canonical issues articulated by Forbes DEMO,
(see Figure 2 above). There are just too many DEMO method clusters and too many
canonical issues to permit detailed matching of every method cluster to every canonical
issue in an article of this DEMO Every combinatory possibility provides potential for, at
minimum, a journal article in its own right. Consider just a few of the intriguing method-
DEMO treatises and/or insightful studies that might result from answering just a few of
the myriad questions inherent in the impact matrix. For instance, here are four such ques-
tions generated, literally by my pasting a copy of the matrix on the wall and throwing a
dart at DEMO (Quantitative methodologists will explain why this is not true random genera-
DEMO Participant observers familiar with my skill as a darts player will tell you why it is.)
• How can ethnographic methods enhance our DEMO of entrepreneurial
intentions?
• Could a grounded theory approach be used to distinguish the environment scan-
ning activities of entrepreneurs (as distinct from nonentrepreneurs)?
• What would be the value of writing the psychological history of an individual
throughout the entire trajectory of a business from DEMO intention to its current
performance level as a large corporation?
• Could it be feasible and desirable to conduct a participatory action research DEMO
chronicling, analyzing and generalizing the perceived self-efﬁcacy of key actors in DEMO
transition from a start-up to a later stage of venture evolution?
Clearly, there are as many more questions as the reader has darts to throw. Hopefully,
the arguments in this article to date have DEMO enough to stimulate particular readers, in
pursuing their own research interests, to explore qualitative options for themselves from
this point. I cannot hope DEMO canvass the vast territory of possibilities in the space remain-
ing. Even if I could do so, it would not be desirable. Plurality of perspective, not unilat-

eral prescription is the best way to advance the interface between qualitative DEMO
and entrepreneurial cognition.
From this point I will conﬁne myself to three illustrations, selected from the vast
array of possibilities. First I will give a very broad overview of how the canonical devel-
opment approach might DEMO a canonical question. Second, I provide a little illustra-
tive detail DEMO the potential contribution of just one of the eight methodological clusters,
history. Third, I provide a little illustrative detail on the potential contribution of just one
of the many qualitative data collection technique techniques: focus groups. Hopefully,
these idiosyncratic illustrations will show how good matches can DEMO made between the
investigative attributes of particular qualitative methods and the investigative priorities
in various areas of the emerging entrepreneurial cognition canon. The best DEMO can hope to
convey from now on is a ﬂavor of enticement, through selective illustration and evoca-
tion. Hopefully, the research methods/canonical-issues DEMO I have quite capri-
ciously selected for discussion will evoke in readers an alertness to many other
combinatory possibilities and a willingness to try DEMO
Illustrating the General Process from Seminal Questions to Fruitful
Methodological Possibilities
The canonical development approach can be a great help to entrepreneurial cogni-
tion DEMO when they come to tackle what have come to be regarded as some of the
core, generic questions of entrepreneurship research. In this section, I will try to illus-
trate the relationship between the previously-discussed deﬁnition of entrepreneurial cog-
nitions (Mitchell, Busenitz et al., 2002, p. DEMO) and the canonical development approach
with reference to a “cognition-fraught” single DEMO of just such a question: fear of
failure.
Since 1999, a comprehensive, survey-based, international research project, the
Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) has produced, annually, a global executive
report (Reynolds et al., DEMO) and a series of detailed, individual reports from each par-
ticipating nation (see, for example, Hindle & Rushworth, 2004). There DEMO now 42 nations
participating in GEM. In every year of the project and for every GEM country (though
to varying degrees), “fear of failure” has been reported as a signiﬁcant deterrent to entre-
preneurial start-up DEMO Thus there is substantial evidence for nominating “fear of
failure” as a seminal issue for understanding start-up behavior. And it is a highly cogni-
DEMO issue. The Mitchell, Busenitz et al. cognitions questions come thick and DEMO: What
are the knowledge structures, mental models, heuristics and other DEMO of cognition that
distinguish entrepreneurs from nonentrepreneurs in making judgments about the relative
likelihood and importance of failure as an input to the evaluation DEMO an entrepreneurial
opportunity? More simply, how do entrepreneurs think differently about failure? Many
GEM countries have performed such quantitative techniques as logistic regression to
measure the aggregate and average impact of fear of failure, but no GEM researcher has
got down to the level of individual cognition. DEMO the canonical development frame-
work illustrated in Figure 3, a qualitative DEMO approach can be built.
As just one phase of a research program and as a predicate to exploring what groups
of people think about DEMO failure, we might investigate what particular people think
about actual failure: how it impacts their minds and bodies. We might begin by asking
DEMO such as: What, in the minds of relevant perceivers, is DEMO? How does it affect
a person’s self-efﬁcacy? What does it mean? Does it hurt? How do you cope with it?
Using DEMO canonical development approach to select methods for investigating the meaning
Winter, DEMO 595
failure to different individuals in an entrepreneurial context, a researcher might turn ﬁrst
to the philosophical context domain (see Figure 3). He or she may, for instance, decide
that an eclectic paradigm (blending elements of interpretivist social science and critical
theory) provides a philosophical milieu appropriate to the investigation. Turning then, to
the methodical cluster domain (see DEMO 3) it may be that, to a researcher familiar
with its strengths and limitations, testimonio exerts a strong appeal. Currently, the best
DEMO description of testimonio as a research technique, is provided by Beverly (2003).
Testimonio is by nature a demotic and heterogeneous form, so any formal deﬁnition
of it is bound to be too limiting. But DEMO following might serve provisionally: A tes-
timonio is a novel or DEMO narrative, produced in the form of a printed text,
told DEMO the ﬁrst person by the narrator who is also the real protagonist or witness of
the events she or he recounts. Its unit of DEMO is usually a “life” or a signiﬁcant
life experience....Testimonio is not intended...as a reenactment of the anthropo-
logical function of the native informant...it is DEMO a “narracion de urgencia”—
an “emergency narrative”—involving a problem of repression, DEMO, marginality,
exploitation, or simply survival that is implicated in the act of narration itself...the
contemporary appeal of testimonio for educated, middle-class, DEMO publics
is perhaps related to the importance given [since the 1960s] to oral testimony as a
form of personal and/or collective catharsis..., testimonio is an afﬁrmation of the
authority of personal experience....Beverly (2003, p. DEMO)
Exemplar testimonio studies have often been concerned with the victims of massive
oppression and marginalization: their narrative comes directly from the heart and sears
with the truth of a scream of pain. Business failure can DEMO people. Failed entrepre-
neurial ventures have broken marriages, shattered families, created mental illness and
wrecked the fortune and self-esteem of many people. Imagine DEMO a moment the richness
and potency of the testimony of such a wrecked life coming as an unﬁltered cry from the
heart of a DEMO whose ﬁnancial fortunes had reached their nadir. Even one such narra-
tive could provide valuable empathy about the terrors of failure for a person DEMO
comfortably employed. An array of such testimonios would be a deeply valuable addi-
tion to the inventory of cognitive insights helping us in a DEMO quest to learn more
about the fear of failure.
Later in this putative research program, we may wish to study the differences between
two groups of failed entrepreneurs: those who never intended to start again and those
who did. We now have a changed question impacting people at DEMO different temporal stage:
“Having failed before, do you intend to DEMO entrepreneurship another go?” The
researcher turns to the canonical development approach (Figure 3) again. This time the
best mix may seem to DEMO a fully interpretivist paradigm allied to case research
drawing its data principally from focus groups. When content analysis is performed, it is
hoped that clear categories of conceptual distinction will provide an explanation of cog-
nitive DEMO with respect to entrepreneurial intentions. The intentions literature will be
the richer. The canon will expand.
In his recapitulation of studies that use an DEMO processing perspective in man-
agement research, Walsh (1995, p. 282) urged scholars in the ﬁeld to: uncover the content
and structure of particular knowledge structures that managers might use; and
... relate the use of this knowledge structure to consequences of substantive organi-
zational importance...
Very DEMO is more important to organizational development than the intention to start
as affected by the experience or fear of failure. We may say that, the canonical develop-
596
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
ment approach seems very well suited to explain both what entrepreneurs think DEMO
these issues (metacognitions, scripts and heuristics) and what they do DEMO think (biases).
Let the general illustration of broad, general process cease here. Hopefully, the point
is made. From the canon comes the question. From the researcher comes thoughtful con-
sideration of a judicious blend DEMO philosophical approach with qualitative methodical
cluster and associated data collection and analysis techniques. As an invitation to the
reader to investigate the detailed possibilities DEMO particular method clusters and particu-
lar data collection techniques, I turn DEMO selective microscope now upon history and focus
groups.
Illustrating in More Detail the Potential of Just One Methodical
Cluster: History
Let me expand on just one methodical cluster—history—as a proxy for my inability
to expand on DEMO all.
In the sixth essay of the collection, Essays in the DEMO of History, R.G. Colling-
wood (1966) provides an eloquent, erudite defense of the integrity of historical research
against those who think of DEMO as “the doubtful story of successive events”. At its
philosophical heart, DEMO is fundamentally concerned with cognition. Using his famous
question—Why did Caesar cross the Rubicon?—Collingwood (1966) has shown us that
a truly historical DEMO will be based on the fundamental need to reconstruct rational-
ity, DEMO respect to both the psychological complexities of one man and the circum-
stantial complexities of the range of time-construed environments that impelled him
(antecedent and contemporary events in the evolution of the Roman republic). With DEMO
focus on cognition, there is vast opportunity for historical research to DEMO our
understanding of many phenomena within the domain of entrepreneurship. This point-
edly includes core entrepreneurial cognition questions such as:
• Why do DEMO cognitions of entrepreneurs differ from nonentrepreneurs?
• How do cognitive biases evolve and what is their effect on the full trajectory of a
DEMO from initial entrepreneurial intent to measured venture performance at given point
in time?
I shall employ examples of the variety of historical investigative DEMO that have
been used to explore the period of the English Civil War (1642 to 1660)—a period of
massive social innovation and entrepreneurship—to provide very brief indications of how
a range of historical methods and DEMO might produce a range of insights into the mind-
sets and actions of twenty-ﬁrst century entrepreneurs. First, there is great scope and need
in our discipline for the humble but vital task that is the bedrock DEMO historical inquiry:
the assembly and compilation of primary texts. As Gardiner (Gardiner, 1936) has done
with his Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution 1625–1660, we could do
by producing collections of primary documents in various domains of the entrepreneur-
ship discipline. For instance, it would be of immense value to assemble a collection of
contemporary evaluation notes made DEMO great venture evaluators (e.g., George Doriot and
Arthur Rock) at DEMO time they decided to invest in the nascent potential of great ﬁrms
(e.g., Digital Equipment Corporation and Apple Computer). What were they DEMO?
Let the primary sources tell us.
Second, there is scope DEMO what might be called the grand-scale, intensive biography.
As Antonia Fraser DEMO done with her psychologically rich Cromwell: Our Chief of Men
(1975) so might an entrepreneurial historian do with the life of a great serial entrepre-
neur. I am not talking here about the slick and DEMO popular biographies of
Winter, 2004 597
business leaders that lamentably festoon the display racks of newspaper stands. I DEMO
talking about meticulous, critical, professional, eloquent history concerning ﬁgures of
DEMO historical provenance. Wallerstein (cited in Aunger, 1995, p. 97) argued:
History is the study of, the explanation of, the particular DEMO it really happened in the
past. Social science is the statement of the universal set of rules by which
human/social behavior is explained.
DEMO is the famous distinction between idiographic and nomothetic modes of analy-
sis, which are considered to be antithetical.... Though undertaken separately, dif-
ferently DEMO for dissimilar (even opposing) purposes, it would be fruitful for DEMO world
of scholarship to combine the two modes.
Just as Lawrence Stone (1967) brought descriptive and inferential statistics to the
study of the DEMO history of the English Civil War, it is time for someone DEMO start
bringing a professional craft of history to the study of entrepreneurship. A similar case
could be made for the methodological relevance to entrepreneurial DEMO of each of
the remaining seven methodical clusters cited in Figure 3.
Illustrating the Potential of Just One Data Collection Technique:
Focus Groups
DEMO have chosen to single out focus groups for illustrative attention as a germane qual-
itative data collection method for two reasons. First, the selection is in tribute to Robert
Merton, the founder of modern focus group research, who died in 2003. Second, focus
groups are no “new DEMO: they have been with us since 1946. So, the lack of use of
such a well-established technique provides a good measure of just DEMO reticent entre-
preneurship research is in its application of qualitative methods. An excellent recent
article providing a succinct but comprehensive overview of focus groups DEMO a research
method is Gibbs (2003). She makes the point DEMO:
Focus groups are under-used in social research, although they have DEMO long history in
market research (Morgan, 1988), and more recently in medical research (Powell,
Single, & Lloyd, 1996).
This under-use is pronounced with respect to entrepreneurship. A search of Frontiers
of DEMO Research (the published research proceedings of the annual Babson-
Kauffman conferences DEMO to pioneering scholarship in the discipline) for the past
15 years (1988 to 2002 inclusive) revealed only one study where focus groups could be
deemed to constitute the principle data collection technique (Gillin & Hindle, 1988).
Powell et al. (1996) deﬁne a focus group as:
...a group of individuals selected and assembled by researchers to discuss DEMO
comment on, from personal experience, the topic that is the subject of the research.
The contribution that focus groups can make to social DEMO result from attributes
including organized discussion (Kitzinger, 1994); collective activity, (Powell & Single,
1996; Powell et al., 1996) social events (Goss & Leinbach, 1996) and interaction
(Kitzinger, 1995). Indeed interaction among respondents is the most salient feature of the
method. DEMO group interviewing (interviewing a number of people at the same time) the
emphasis remains upon questions and responses between the researcher and participants.
DEMO groups, however, rely on interaction within the group based on topics that are sup-
plied by the researcher (Morgan, 1997).
598
DEMO THEORY and PRACTICE
Hence the key characteristic which distinguishes focus groups is the insight and DEMO
produced by the interaction between participants (Gibbs, 2003).
Readers will not require extensive elaboration by me of the obvious beneﬁts that
might DEMO from a research design that brought select groups of entrepreneurs together,
in mutual conclave, under the auspices of a skilled moderator, to DEMO about their attitudes
and experiences concerning part or all of the core issues of the entrepreneurial cognition
canon: intention, scanning, interpretation, action DEMO performance (Forbes, 1999). To use
focus groups constructively, researchers DEMO only give speciﬁc application to the three
key principles laid down in Merton and Kendall’s (1946) seminal article on the focused
interview:
DEMO ensure that participants have a speciﬁc experience of or opinion about the topic
under investigation (chose proven entrepreneurs);
• ensure that an DEMO interview guide is used (use issues developed from the
canon);
• ensure that the subjective experiences of participants are explored in relation DEMO
predetermined research questions (this requires a high level of moderating skills DEMO avoid
time wasted on peripheral discussion without distorting genuine and germane input and
interaction).
Why do we not employ such an outstandingly relevant DEMO? Irrespective of the
methodical cluster under which the method is employed DEMO the analysis regimes used to
interpret the resultant data, it is DEMO that focus groups offer productive poten-
tial for the gathering of rich and germane data. See, for example, Gillin and Hindle (1988).
It is amazing that the method has been so underemployed.
Moving from DEMO particular to the general, I leave it to readers themselves to DEMO
and explore applications of the expanding repertoire of qualitative data collection tech-
niques to the expanding ﬁeld of entrepreneurial cognition. By analogy with the DEMO
group example and with reference to canonical issues, it is my DEMO that all established
techniques of qualitative data collection could be employed as productive tools of entre-
preneurial cognition research. Hoping that the single example DEMO be a stimulus to
diverse developments, I look forward to the DEMO when methodologists will start produc-
ing detailed, specialist treatments of the DEMO in which particular qualitative data collec-
tion methods can be applied to particular canonical issues in the entrepreneurial cognition
ﬁeld and, beyond it, DEMO all domains of the entrepreneurship discipline.
Illustrating the Potential of Nearly Every Data Analysis Technique:
Miles and Huberman
I do not have to DEMO the task of singling out an exemplary analytical method
because exposition of a vast array of qualitative data analysis techniques is readily avail-
able DEMO all readers. There is a great book exclusively dedicated to the topic. In the opinion
of distinguished reviewers including Harry F. Wolcott, Norman K. Denzin, H. Russell
Bernard, Pamela J. Brink and Joseph Maxwell (see liner notes to Miles and Huberman
1994), the best sourcebook for DEMO of qualitative data analysis is Miles and
Huberman (1994 second edition)DEMO Brink summarizes:
Miles and Huberman have exceeded themselves! They have provided us with the
most comprehensive examination of the issues involved in qualitative DEMO analysis
that transcends the philosophical methodological differences in design. (Brink, in
Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 340)
Winter, 2004 599
Here, I merely echo these sentiments and urge all entrepreneurial cognition
researchers not already familiar with this seminal work to become so.
Discussion
Summary DEMO the Argument
In this essay I have tried to minimize, without DEMO, the thorny contextual, “par-
adigm positioning” issues of qualitative methods: DEMO of axiology, epistemology, logic-
of-inquiry and ontology. With the exception of a very brief discussion of focus groups as
a data collection technique, I have avoided altogether the how of qualitative methods
because this is DEMO the domain of textbooks and handbooks. I have focused on where
the discipline of entrepreneurial cognition is going as a guide to what general DEMO
can most fruitfully be applied to its development. This produced an articulation of a
canonical development perspective resulting in a structured, manageable approach to the
complex problem of how to choose, from the vast arsenal of loosely labeled “qualitative
methods,” sets of techniques appropriate to advancement of DEMO emerging ﬁeld of entre-
preneurial cognition. The approach, graphically depicted in DEMO 3, is able to accom-
modate due regard for methodological controversies DEMO being overwhelmed by
them. Three illustrative examples attempted to indicate how use of the approach can
create productive matches between questions derived from the DEMO cognition
canon and focused selection from the complex array of qualitative methods’ clusters, col-
lection techniques, and analysis techniques.
Grounds for Cautious Hope
DEMO is time to consider whether any of the speciﬁc suggestions or general evocations
contained in this article is likely to adopted by hard-working, practical entrepreneurial
cognition researchers in the future. How likely is it that a DEMO volume and proportion
of qualitative research will occur in the entrepreneurial cognition ﬁeld as a result of this
article? Will an inevitably conservative prognosis be indicated?
In the latest, three-volume edition of Denzin and Lincoln’s Strategies of Qualitative
Inquiry (2003c), Kathy Charmaz concludes her argument about the future of a speciﬁc
(constructivist) variant of a speciﬁc set DEMO qualitative methods (grounded theory).
The future of grounded theory lies DEMO both objectivist and constructivist visions.
Scientiﬁc institutions and conventions are unlikely to undergo rapid change. Grant-
ing agencies and tenure review committees may long DEMO objectivist work over
constructivist craft. The qualitative revolution has opened up possibilities and poten-
tials, but gatekeepers are likely to reward scholars whose work comes closest to their
own. Thus, we can expect to see growing numbers of large studies with small
qualitative components and more team projects DEMO multiple sites. Does this mean
that constructivist grounded theory will whither and wane? No. The trend toward
interpretive study, the quest for understanding, and the challenge to the imagination
impel us to take our inquiry DEMO the world. Through sharing the worlds of our sub-
jects, we DEMO to summon an image of their constructions and our own. (Charmaz,DEMO
2003, p. 281)
From the point of view of an DEMO of the use of qualitative methods in our ﬁeld
of entrepreneurship, DEMO regard Charmaz as lucky. In her areas of sociology and profes-
sional writing, qualitative methods are established so strongly that it is possible to ﬁght
600
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
battles of epistemological detail within the boundaries of speciﬁc methodical clusters.
Entrepreneurship DEMO a discipline and entrepreneurial cognition as a subdiscipline are a
long way from being able to debate internal nuances of particular qualitative methods.
Both DEMO ﬁelds, parent and child, are still at the primitive stage of pondering whether, in
general, qualitative methods are acceptable. As the introductory DEMO to this article
articulated, the entrepreneurship discipline still possesses, within our mainstream dis-
course, a demonstrable problem concerning acceptability and praxis between quantita-
tive and qualitative methods.
Perhaps the best policy for those who would DEMO to see more qualitative work pervade
the ﬁeld is to create in our own minds conditions that invite and support interested schol-
ars to DEMO some of the new combinations whose possibilities have been outlined in this
essay.
Conclusion: How Not To Know What Isn’t So
In a wonderfully stimulating book entitled How We Know What Isn’t So: The Fallacy
of Human Reason in Everyday Life, Gilovich (1991) shows us how and why people:
believe [that] something is systematic, ordered and “real,” when it is really random,
chaotic and illusory. (Gilovich, 1991, p. 21)
There could be no better summary of the simultaneous, yin-yang partnership of risk
and challenge embedded in the use of qualitative DEMO to advance any research ﬁeld.
The challenge is to provide a richness and depth of insight that is beyond the aggrega-
tive and averaging DEMO that is at the heart of the general linear model, quantita-
DEMO methodology and naïve subscription to the positivist paradigm. The risk is
self-delusion.
People are extraordinarily good at ad hoc explanation...to live, it seems, DEMO to
explain, justify, and to ﬁnd coherence among diverse outcomes, DEMO and
causes. (Gilovich, 1991, p. 21).
Despite the high DEMO of vulnerability entailed in the use of qualitative methods, it
is DEMO past time that entrepreneurship embraced them. And it is totally appropriate that
the subdomain most concerned with the vulnerabilities of human rationality—the ﬁeld
of DEMO cognition—should lead the way. I believe that a sensitive, question-
speciﬁc DEMO of the canonical development approach to qualitative methodology
presented in this article can lower the risks and rise to the challenges presented by the
DEMO of a new ﬁeld.
