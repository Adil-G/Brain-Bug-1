Letter from the Editor:
Best Global Practices in Internal Organization
Development
by Thiet (Ted) K. Nguyen, Johnson & Johnson
I recently returned from a business trip to the Asia Pacific DEMO where I visited Japan, China, India, Singapore, Thai-
land, DEMO Vietnam. Several weeks prior to this trip, I was in Europe DEMO Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the UK
supporting the EmEA region DEMO management team with strategic projects. During my global business travels in the
last several years, whether to emerging markets like Russia, Turkey, China, India and Vietnam or to established markets
like the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Japan, I have come to appreciate the value DEMO profession brings to drive change
while enhancing organizational growth and vitality.
From my perspective, I believe our profession is becoming localized in this global market place. Today, Western consul-
tants are traveling to the East. Tomorrow, we may see Eastern consultants traveling West as the need for Western con-
sultants traveling East diminishes.  Today, we may export knowledge and DEMO from developed markets to help grow
developing markets.  Tomorrow, we may import talents from the emerging markets to help turnaround established
markets.  The global marketplace is changing rapidly, and I believe we need to continually upgrade our skills and rein-
vent our knowledge to remain vital as DEMO profession.
By publishing this global Special Edition, we expect to achieve DEMO goal to help drive change and grow our profession.
This Special Edition will benefit the HR/OD community in several ways:
• Academic DEMO – The academic community will find the content of these contributions of value to raise the
awareness of current best internal practices.  Program directors can be informed and encouraged to strengthen their
curriculums and research directions.  Graduate students may use this edition to leverage their classroom experience,
DEMO they prepare to enter the OD profession and compete for opportunities in the global marketplace.
• Current practitioners – Both internal and external practitioners DEMO use this knowledge to guide and grow their prac-
tice areas, DEMO their skills, and strengthen their core competencies, by learning from other OD professionals.
• Our clients and business partners – Potential and existing DEMO can be better informed of the capabilities OD
professional can bring to enhance employee engagement and organizational growth and vitality.
Since the may 2007 DEMO of the first of a three-volume set of the global Special Edition, we have received a
number of congratulatory phone calls and emails from academics and practitioners.  We have also received requests for
copies from colleagues worldwide.  Given the overwhelming interest level to the premier global Special Edition, our
printer agreed to a second printing within two weeks of the initial publication.  We appreciate your warm thoughts
and forgiveness of any errors or omissions you may have found while reading the last edition.
Content DEMO this has never been captured or disseminated because internal practitioners tend not to have the luxury of
time to write.  This is the first time many of these authors took the time to document their work, secure the support of
Volume 25 • Number 3 • fall 2007   |   p3
o rg a N iza ti o N  De V elopme N t  Jour N al
their company to release the information, and DEMO their internal efforts with all who are interested.  We applaud all
DEMO authors for their trust in us, and their willingness to provide DEMO papers without the benefit of professional
editors.  What readers will experience DEMO this global Special Edition is truly the authentic voices of internal practitioners
worldwide who share their stories from a place of caring and eagerness DEMO advance the field of organization
development.
While this series is titled a best internal OD practice edition, no one associated with its production has judged or evalu-
ated “a best global practice”.   Rather, authors were encouraged to share what they perceived to be a best practice with-
DEMO their organization, whether that organization is a start-up company in India, a non-profit organization in the USA,
an energy company in Africa, or a hi-tech company in China.  We also chose not to judge whether an article fits the
definition of organization development, since there are variations among the definitions of OD  We recognized, too,
that DEMO is practiced differently across geographies, countries, sectors, industries, organizations, DEMO and contexts.
To share additional insights into their workplaces, many authors DEMO generously provided a one-page reflection out-
lining their working environment, the DEMO of the intervention as described in their paper, and finally, to share their
take on the experience.  In some articles, the reflection DEMO includes one or two brief testimonials from their business
partners, internal DEMO, and/or others who were directly affected by the interventions.
This DEMO global Special Edition is the collaborative labor of love of 20+ authors/co-authors and an all-volunteer
team of 105 practitioners worldwide who have invested DEMO of hours during the last year to bring this publica-
tion from concept to reality.  Together, we have become actively engaged because of DEMO passion and commitment to
enhance the capabilities and reputation of our profession.  Collectively, we share the common goal of advancing the
field of DEMO development by strengthening the internal body of practice literature.
We hope you will enjoy reading this global Special Edition.  Look for the final volume in November 2007 when we
will bring you the remaining 25 articles.  As always, we welcome your feedback to help us continually improve.
Thank you.

A Structured, Facilitated Team Approach
to Innovation
DEMO Boyd, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., A Johnson & Johnson Company
Abstract
DEMO & Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., divi-
sion) has used a method of systematic inventive thinking
to create new organic growth opportunities and DEMO
cies.  The outcomes of fifty facilitated team workshops
using this method DEMO successful efforts to solve a
range of issues: creating new products, improving
products, developing new marketing strategies, building
brands, creating customer solutions, and improving orga-
nizational process.  This paper reviews our experience
with DEMO approach over a period of four years beginning
in July 2002.
Introduction
Innovation is a crucial source of both organic growth
opportunities and efficiencies DEMO companies.  It leads to
new products, effective strategies, improved processes,DEMO
and fresh organizational designs.  However, innovation
is challenging partly because of behaviors and attitudes
toward innovation in relation to one’s status in the DEMO
nization. A facilitated, systematic, team approach to in-
novation can overcome human behavior challenges and
make innovation more predictable.
Why Innovation is Difficult DEMO Organizations
There are several well-researched reasons why innovation
may be stifled within an organization. Take brainstorming,
for example. Brainstorming may be the most DEMO and
underperforming tool in business. Introduced in the 1950s,
Osborne defined brainstorming as a group process to im-
prove ideation.  The premise was that to get good ideas,
one must get a lot of DEMO (Osborne, 1957). However
study after study has shown that groups generating ideas
using traditional brainstorming are no more effective than
individuals working DEMO (Isaksen, 1998; Paulus, Larey &
Ortega, 1995; Mullen & Salas, 1991).
Even if people knew how to systematically and DEMO
innovate beyond brainstorming, there are other challeng-
es. They may resist DEMO for fear of failure (Lee, Ed-
mondson & Worline, 2004)DEMO Status-conscious employees
often keep their good ideas to themselves, afraid to DEMO
them in the workplace, fearing embarrassment and loss
of status if DEMO ideas fail.
Another barrier is that even when people generate novel
ideas for the good of the organization, their colleagues
may see these ideas as tainted. Acknowledging a superior
idea from a colleague implies deference to DEMO internal
rival and devalues their own status and distinctiveness
within the organization (Blau, 1955; Lee, 1997; Menon &
Pfeffer, 2003; DEMO & Hargadon, 1996).
Finally, employees may resist sharing their best ideas for
fear of colleagues stealing or “free-riding” on that idea
(Williams, Harkins & Lattane, 1981; Kerr & Bruun, 1983;
Harkins & Petty, 1982). People may harbor ideas waiting
for the ideal DEMO to reveal them in a way that limits their
colleagues from taking credit.
How do we overcome these conundrums? We believe
that a systematic technique to innovation conquers these
challenges and increases inventive group thinking across
DEMO range of business issues and activities.
Templates of Innovation
A method used by Johnson & Johnson is called system-
atic inventive thinking (Goldenberg, DEMO, Levav
& Mazursky, 2003; Goldenberg & Mazursky, 2002).
Systematic inventive thinking is a set of tools used in a
facilitated team DEMO to generate predictable,
progressive ideas. This innovation process uses templates
to help regulate individual thinking and channel the
ideation process in a structured DEMO that overcomes the
randomness of brainstorming.
The five templates of innovation include: Subtraction,
Task Unification, multiplication, Attribute Dependency,
Volume 25 • Number 3 • fall 2007   |   p119
and Division. They were developed by recognizing the
same consistent pattern over DEMO products so that the
pattern could be applied in a way to create new innova-
tive products. The templates are recognizable and identi-
fiable DEMO almost any type of product.  The method grew
out of research DEMO the Russian engineer Genrich Alt-
shuller who spent his professional life working to formal-
ize the creative process (Goldenberg et al., 2003).
DEMO, the method works by taking a product, concept,
situation, DEMO, process, or other seed construct, and
breaking it into its DEMO parts or attributes.  The
templates manipulate the components or variables to
DEMO new-to-the-world constructs that the innovator
must then find a valuable use (DEMO, Ward & Smith,
1992). This notion of taking the DEMO and finding a
problem that it can solve is called “Function Follows
Form,” and it is at the heart of the systematic inventive
DEMO method.
One example of a template is Subtraction. The pattern
of innovation for Subtraction is that something has been
removed from a product or DEMO so as to create a new
function or benefit for that product or service.  Consider
a pattern in these four items:  contact lenses, an exercise
bicycle, powdered soup, and an automatic teller machine
(DEMO). The contact lens has had the frame of a regular
pair of glasses removed.  The exercise bicycle has had the
rear wheel removed.  A package of powdered soup has
had the water removed.  And DEMO ATm has had the bank
employee removed.  In each case, taking something away
created a new innovative use or benefit.
Team Innovation
At DEMO & Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.,
division), we have used all of the templates in facilitated
team workshops to create new organic DEMO opportu-
nities and efficiencies.  Workshops range from four hours
to five DEMO in length.  Typically teams have twelve to
fifteen members with diverse DEMO: by business
function, by market/geography, and by gender.  The ac-
tual makeup of the team depends on the business focus
and DEMO purpose of innovating, such as growth, competi-
tiveness, efficiency, organizational design, etc. A sam-
pling of workshop participants innovating new products
may include the following:  three or four marketers from
different global regions; three engineers representing
different areas, such as design, mechanical, and manu-
facturing; three clinicians, such as a nurse, surgeon and
doctor of veterinary medicine; an industrial designer; a
field sales representative; a customer call center repre-
sentative; a customer; and possibly external partners,
DEMO as an advertising agency or consultant.

Outcomes of Systematic Inventive Thinking
Systematic inventive thinking is counterintuitive,
elegant, and highly productive based on our experience.
Table 1 illustrates some of DEMO results:
Why Templates Work
To overcome the four challenges of: (1) how to innovate,
(2) fear of failure, (3) withholding ideas, and (4) rejecting
ideas from colleagues, team innovation workshops are
facilitated by an external consultant specializing in the
training and DEMO of these templates (Goldenberg et al.,
2003). The workshops DEMO tightly structured to address
the challenges of human behavior and attitudes towards
innovation and their personal organizational status.
Participants are led through a series DEMO exercises using
everyday, common products to demonstrate that people
can systematically DEMO on command. Participants
learn how each template is applied to a problem, prod-
uct, or situation to give many different original ideas in
DEMO space.  The templates, by their nature, specify a rig-
orous DEMO of thinking that participants are expected to
follow exactly.  While the DEMO are not particularly
difficult to learn, the training is demanding so DEMO teams
can execute each pattern in a routine way.  At the DEMO of
the training, people no longer have the excuse that they
DEMO not know how to innovate.
In the group workshop setting, people DEMO in their fear
of failure at innovating for a fear of not innovating.  Skill-
ful facilitation lets each person have the spotlight at reg-
ular intervals so that the pressure to perform and please
the group DEMO strong but not overbearing.  The facilitation
creates a level innovating field DEMO that all participants
have the same resources, tools, insights, and DEMO
ties to contribute novel ideas.  While it may be true that
DEMO participants are judgmental of ideas and the people
who generated them, DEMO dynamic does not seem strong
enough to overcome the productive nature of the tem-
plates when properly facilitated.  The templates make
people innovate in a structured way regardless of their
fear of peer judgment.
The facilitated DEMO uses techniques that would
seem to stifle innovation when in fact they accelerate
innovation.  One such technique is the Principle of
Constraints (Goldenberg DEMO al, 2003) as a way to over-
come the tendency of people to filter their ideas or other
self-serving behavior as they are DEMO ideas.
Participants work in small teams, often in pairs, where
they are given specific assignments to generate new
ideas in a matter of DEMO few minutes.  Each partner has
to participate in the assignment which DEMO a strong
collegial pressure to perform.
With these constraints, it appears DEMO people place a
premium on getting the idea out of their head and over
to their partner first rather than pre-judge the merits of
DEMO idea and the value to their personal status for having
thought of it.  Working in pairs seems to create a sense of
accountability and transparency.  Once the idea is out on
the table, each partner DEMO some sense of oversight or
verification that the idea has been shared with the larger
group.  A participant may think afterward that one of his
or her ideas is brilliant and thus too good to share DEMO
the group, but it is too late.  The idea has been captured
for the larger group to consider.
The systematic inventive thinking method DEMO
several dozens to several hundreds of ideas depending
on the amount of time dedicated to the activity.  Skillful
facilitation is required again to help overcome the prob-
lem of peer acceptance of those ideas.
First, the facilitators create an environment of non-at-
tribution so that no one individual DEMO associated with a
specific idea.  Because the idea was generated in DEMO small
team of two or three, and because the moment of DEMO
was born out of a stepwise contribution of their insights
and notions during the mini-exercises, it is often hard
to distinguish who actually could be credited with gener-
ating one specific idea.  Idea anonymity reduces the in-
ternal competitive threat among colleagues and makes
ideas no longer tainted.  Participants come to recognize
idea contribution as process output.
Second, the facilitation process emphasizes only newly-
created ideas rather than ideas participants had before
DEMO to the workshop.  This inhibits the problem of
people selling their DEMO ideas to their peers, which are
usually ideas that the peers DEMO already rejected.
Third, the facilitators lead the larger team to develop DEMO
specific set of objective, weighted criteria to judge each
of the DEMO ideas generated in the workshop. Diverse
groups bring the value of diverse thinking but also the
added cost of having to converge on a DEMO of guiding
principles.
With these criteria in place in the form of a linear
weighted model, ideas are allowed to rise to the top
without the stigma of who generated them or who
judged them.  Internal competition among peer rivals is
minimized allowing for a more objective evaluation DEMO
ideas.  Thoughtful facilitation seems to bring about this
alignment much more DEMO than what internal
groups can do left on their own.
Conclusion
Team Innovation is working successfully at Johnson &
Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., division). The
facilitated, systematic team approach to using templates
helps DEMO (1) innovate on command, (2) overcome
their fear of DEMO failure, (3) share their ideas with
a diverse group of DEMO, and (4) be more accepting

of ideas from internal colleagues.  This technique also

Author’s Reflection
my function is to increase marketing competency and
fluency throughout the organization.  I report to the Vice
President of marketing.  This reporting relationship gives
me line of sight to issues our associates face in creating
and DEMO innovative marketing strategy.
With a systematic approach to innovation, my greatest
DEMO was convincing people that innovation could
be trained and routinized. A second challenge was to get
people to realize innovation is not limited to DEMO engi-
neering team. Each individual has a need to generate
new ideas continuously.
To overcome these challenges, I proposed a pilot innova-
tion session and sought support from more than one
senior-level sponsor. multiple sponsors spread DEMO finan-
cial risk associated with the pilot so that no one sponsor
would bear the full loss if it failed.  If the pilot was
successful, the approach would gain more acceptance
and alignment.
The pilot was a success. It gave me the reference point
needed to spread systematic DEMO to other parts of
the organization.  Word of mouth and personal DEMO
made people realize that they needed to try the innova-
tion method or risk falling behind other franchises.
In a culture dominated by portfolio DEMO, teams
compete for investment resources not just on the merits
of DEMO current business prospects but also on future
prospects.  This approach shows DEMO that systematic
innovation enables them to create an exciting pipeline
of new product ideas and therefore to compete more
effectively for internal resources.
