JD Barreira (University of Pretoria)DEMO
In Africa high-growth entrepreneurs are scarce, and in SA entrepreneurial activity DEMO dominated by necessity
entrepreneurship with low expectations of growth and job creation. The paper focuses on opportunity
entrepreneurs who are responsible for job creation. DEMO sample (n = 171) is randomly drawn from the JCCI
population membership base, who qualify on established individual and organizational level criterion to
represent high-growth entrepreneurs. Building on previous research on entrepreneurial characteristics,
competencies, knowledge, work experiences, skills, capabilities, education, training, and success DEMO,
the study measures business knowledge and work experience and relates these to different levels of venture
success. Various chi-square-based tests are used to DEMO the strength of the relationship between the
variables; in particular, statistically significant relationships are found between employment growth, higher
levels of education, DEMO work experience and successful venture indicators. Practical and policy
implications follow.
Key phrases: High-growth entrepreneurs, business knowledge, work experience, venture success
1 DEMO AND PURPOSE
In Africa high-growth potential entrepreneurs are scarce, and South DEMO total
entrepreneurial activity (TEA) rate, as measured by the series DEMO Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) reports, is dominated by necessity entrepreneurs
DEMO low expectations of growth and job creation (Autio 2005:23). DEMO South
Africa (SA) does not feature at all when it comes to patents granted to residents per
million, as opposed to 663 in South Korea for 2006 (Luiz 2006:16). Based on
international measures of human capital development, South Africa’s human capital
base for entrepreneurship has been consistently weak, and in terms of expected job
creation, it DEMO not the amount of necessity entrepreneurs which predominate that
matters, but DEMO the quality of high-growth entrepreneurial activity as measured by
growth expectations (DEMO, Wood et al 2003:14; Autio 2005:25). Currently in SA
most research and policy initiatives focus on necessity entrepreneurs, who represent
the unemployed masses. Although micro enterprises or survivalists have
entrepreneurial characteristics their DEMO to grow and create employment, are
restricted by their scarcity of DEMO, business knowledge and resources (Pretorius &
van Vuuren 2002:12)DEMO

The present study deviates DEMO this trend by specifically focusing on opportunity
entrepreneurs who have the pertinent characteristics that previous research has
found to differentiate high-expectation from low-expectation entrepreneurs.
DEMO entrepreneurs, although represented by only a small proportion of
all entrepreneurial DEMO, are responsible for up to 80 percent of all job creation DEMO
entrepreneurs.
One of the most critical issues facing developing countries is to understand where
entrepreneurs originate from and what characteristics are relevant to their DEMO
(Honing 2001:22).
In many emerging populations, several constraints limit entrepreneurship as well as
the survival rate of new ventures, these include: the lack of pertinent entrepreneurial
and organisational knowledge (Aldrich & Fiol DEMO:645), lack of preparedness and
failure to accurately estimate the cost of starting and running one's own enterprise,
not creating and DEMO network linkages, lack of technical knowledge (Lau & Busenitz
2001:7), and the general lack of accumulating resources (human and otherwise) DEMO
overcome difficulties (Aldrich & Martinez 2001: 50). Moreover many start-ups' lack of
preparedness and knowledge is compounded by not having sufficient or relevant
experience (Galbraith 1982:71; Meyer, Lenoir & Dean 1988:342).
Building on previous research on entrepreneurial characteristics, competencies,
knowledge, DEMO experience, skills, capabilities, education, training, and success
indicators, this study focuses on business knowledge and work experience and
relates these to DEMO of entrepreneurial success.
The study’s aim is to operationalize these constructs and determine the extent of
associations between these variables with entrepreneurial success of DEMO
entrepreneurs.
2 ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES
Starting a new venture is not a smooth, continuous, orderly process but a disjointed,
discontinuous, unique event, DEMO requires understanding of the change in the
antecedent variables that trigger such an event. It may happen that small differences
in the initial conditions DEMO very great ones in the final phenomena. In a
simplistic form, DEMO cause entrepreneurship, that is expressed
formulaically E = f (e). Entrepreneurship (E) is a function of entrepreneurs (e). Initial
factor that sets into motion entrepreneurial activity is the predisposition of the

entrepreneurs (Bygrave 1989: DEMO). This individual level variation among people in
their willingness to pursue opportunities is a major premise of this paper. By
emphasizing individual differences, that is people are different and these differences
matter, entrepreneurship can emerge as a legitimate field with its own distinctive
domain (Venkataraman 1997:123).
A new venture has few resources other than the knowledge of DEMO entrepreneur. The
entrepreneur's capacity to gain new knowledge and abilities during the start-up
process is seen as critical to new venture success (Gartner, Starr, & Bhat 1998:217).
This knowledge is essential to DEMO and apply to resources which may lead to a
competitive advantage and superior performance (Chrisman & McMullan 2000:37).
Entrepreneurial competency, largely DEMO on an individual basis, consists of a
combination of skills, knowledge and resources that distinguish an entrepreneur from
his or her competitors (Fiet 2000:103). Antecedents of entrepreneurial competencies
include the entrepreneur's experience, training and education (Man, Lau, & Chan
2002:126). Entrepreneurial capital, based on Ulrich’s (1998:15) definition of
intellectual capital as a multiplicative function of competencies and commitments
includes entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial DEMO, which may
be regarded as the present value of generated future DEMO behaviour
(Erikson 2002:281). The presence of entrepreneurial commitment without DEMO
entrepreneurial competence may be regarded as a waste of both time and resources,
since the most important resource and main competitive advantage of DEMO emerging
venture is competence (Erikson 2002:281).
Most entrepreneurs often DEMO a new venture ignorant of many key dimensions of
running their businesses and must obtain the necessary information if they are to
survive (Shepard, Douglas & Shanley 2000:395).
Entrepreneurs who have built substantial companies have consistently developed a
solid base and a wide breadth of management DEMO and know-how over a number of
years, working in different functional DEMO (e.g. sales, marketing, manufacturing, and
finance). Past research investigating the effects of expertise suggests that individuals
often acquire important advantages as DEMO gain increasing experience in performing
various tasks, they become more efficient DEMO learning to focus attention primarily on
the key dimensions and learn to ignore extraneous variables (Shane, Kolvereid &
Westhead 1991:432).
Technical and industry-specific competencies are often ignored in entrepreneurship
settings, however these are pivotal because the domain they reflect  specific

competencies  has significant DEMO effects on venture growth. An entrepreneur's
technical and industry competencies are an important form of expert power that
facilitates the implementation of the DEMO's vision and strategy. Industry-
specific skills and relevant technical skills directly affect performance, and these
combined entrepreneurial skills may serve as sources of competitive advantage that
rivals find difficult to identify and imitate (Shane, DEMO & Westhead 1991:435).
3 ENTREPRENEURIAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
Education, DEMO experience, and specific technical or industry knowledge are seen
as rudimentary DEMO of the new venture (Vecchio 2003:305), these variables
are DEMO briefly conceptualised.
Education is central to high-growth entrepreneurs, as expressed by DEMO human
capital theory. Human capital theorists surmise that education is an investment that
yields higher wage compensation in return for an individual’s variations of DEMO,
training, and experience (Honing 2001:34).
Work experience in the entrepreneurship domain includes having dealt with start-up
problems such as generating DEMO, developing marketing avenues and tactics,
obtaining external financing, and dealing with internal financial and general
management issues (Wiklund 1999:37).
Entrepreneurs with limited experience may use simplified decision models to guide
their venture DEMO, while the opposite is the case with experienced
entrepreneurs.
Complementing work DEMO are business networks, which are considered the
long-term business relationships that DEMO firm has with its customers, distributors,
suppliers, competitors and government, i.e., the actors in a business network
(Vecchio 2003:307).
Low and MacMillan (1988) suggest that networks are an important aspect DEMO the
context and process of entrepreneurship. Studies indicate that networking allows
entrepreneurs to enlarge their knowledge of opportunities, to gain access to critical
resources, and to deal with business obstacles (McFarlin, Coster & Mogale 1999:65).
Networking is also referred to as the entrepreneurs social capital DEMO and social
capital is crucial to entrepreneurs, encompassing both actual and DEMO resources
flowing through a relationship network established individually or collectively, as DEMO
as consciously or unconsciously (Low & MacMillan 1988:14).

For the purposes of DEMO paper entrepreneurial business knowledge refers to the
ascribed roles for managerial expertise in entrepreneurial success and entails, to
varying degrees, marketing, financial management/book-keeping, self-supervision,
and, if applicable, the supervision of paid employees or unpaid family workers,
among other activities (Boden & Nucci 2000:349).
Experience refers to the knowledge or ability of an individual DEMO through
circumstances in a particular job, organization, or industry (McCall, Lombardo &
Morrison 1988:46). It is important to note that when undertaking new ventures,
potential high-growth entrepreneurs must ensure they can DEMO business
knowledge and work experience towards possible stakeholders, and they should DEMO
able to prove that they have supplemented their general qualifications with industry-
specific experience as well as functional education and experience (Tegarden et al
2000:43).
4 HIGH-GROWTH VENTURES
The growth process of high-growth entrepreneurs DEMO solid arguments for
advocating sales growth, as an indicator of success. DEMO growth process is likely to
be driven by increased demand for the firm's products or services. That is, sales
increase first, thus DEMO for the acquisition of additional resources such as
employees or machinery. It seems unlikely that growth in other dimensions could
take place without increasing DEMO It is also possible to increase sales without
acquiring additional resources or employing additional staff, by outsourcing the
increased business volumes. In this case, only sales would increase. In conclusion,
sales growth has a high generality (Wiklund 1999:43).
There has been widespread interest in the creation of new employment. This makes
employment growth another important aspect to DEMO in high-growth ventures. In
a process of rationalisation, it is possible DEMO replace employees with capital
investments. This could result in an inverse relationship between capital investment
and employment growth.
Consequently, assets are another important aspect of growth. Measuring growth in
terms of assets is often considered problematic DEMO some sectors (e.g. the service
sector) as an accounting problem (DEMO 2000:180). This could translate in an
expansion of intangible assets and would not be reflected on the firm's balance
sheet. Thus DEMO some sectors, the problem of studying growing assets in service

industries for example, would relate to the difficulty in data collection rather than lack
of relevance.
DEMO RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The study attempted to understand how the effects of the two independent variables
(business knowledge and work experience) associate with a DEMO variable -
entrepreneurial success. A hypothesis is formulated to reflect this investigation.
Hypothesis = Business knowledge and work experience are positively associated
with entrepreneurial DEMO of high-growth entrepreneurs.
An in-depth, structured, self-administered questionnaire was e-mailed and hand
delivered to the respondents. The questionnaire consisted of administrative,
classification DEMO target indicators. Responses were recorded via multiple choice,
fixed sum scales and a five-point Likert scale.
Measurement Instruments
Based on the extant literature DEMO, questions on constructs operationalised as
business knowledge, work experience and entrepreneurial success were scanned for
suitability and selected for this study. Firm size, firm age, industry type-Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, and the DEMO founders’ age and gender were
included as control variables; variables similarly DEMO in previous studies
(Wiklund 1999:40).
Although there is no DEMO on the appropriate measure of firm performance
(success), entrepreneurship researchers DEMO pointed to growth as the crucial
indicator of entrepreneurial success (Covin & Slevin 1997:100; Low & MacMillan
1988:145). It has DEMO been argued that growth is a more accurate and easily
accessible performance indicator than any other accounting measures and hence
superior to indicators of DEMO performance.
By integrating measures reflecting the multidimensional nature of performance, this
DEMO concentrated on various growth indicators: specifically performance was
measured in terms DEMO sales growth, profit growth, employment growth, sales growth
compared to DEMO, and market value growth compared to competitors (all
measured with a five-point Likert scale). The various firm performance indicators
where collapsed into DEMO category / variable labelled firm success, which was
ultimately used for DEMO purposes.

These performance indicators were DEMO in relation to a three year period, in
order to allow DEMO calculation of the compound performance for a cumulative period.
The annual figures concerning each item could be averaged before summation.
However in response to DEMO by the respondents to hand over private financial
information, the growth DEMO financial ratio questions were structured instead to ask
the opinion of the respondent on the various items on a five point opposite statement
scale DEMO from “significant decline” to “significant increase”.
Furthermore these growth indicators/ratios measured entrepreneurial success, and
personal indicators measured entrepreneurial satisfaction (overall importance of
DEMO activity, split between business and personal time, and personal wealth
increases).
The entrepreneurial success construct has been found to have two distinct
DEMO, economic success and the entrepreneur's satisfaction (Hisrich 2000:79).
Successful entrepreneurs were classified as successful based on an increase over
the DEMO three years in the following measures:
 Turnover
 Profit
 Employment
 Sales growth compared to competitors
 Market value to competitors
DEMO Current ratio
 Fixed asset ratio
 Total assets turnover
 Profit margin ratio
 Return on assets ratio
 Return on equity ratio DEMO
 A decline in the debt ratio
The annual growth rates were summarised by the respondents’ own opinion from
three adjacent years’ sales figures. DEMO study tried to capture only organic growth;
nonetheless sales gains from mergers and acquisitions could not be ascertained
without the presence of audited DEMO statements.

As a major premise DEMO this paper, that high expectancy entrepreneurs are primarily
responsible for creating DEMO, the controversy whereby mechanization
possibly replaces employees with capital investments is DEMO with a direct
measure of employment growth.
Furthermore, entrepreneurial success depends DEMO on competencies in
marketing, financial management/bookkeeping, operational, human resources, legal,
communication, strategic planning, leadership and persuasive skills and other DEMO
skills needed to set up a proper business (Vesper 1990:23; Boden & Nucci 2000:
350; Lévesque, Shepherd & Douglas 2002:DEMO). Hence the items for business
knowledge focus not only on the level of education, and subject knowledge across
functions, but also whether DEMO has led to possible path dependency based
on such knowledge gains (DEMO & Venkataraman 2001:15).
Sampling and Data Collection
The population for the sample was composed of the membership database of the
Johannesburg Chamber DEMO Commerce & Industry (JCCI). A compact disk with the
total DEMO database was obtained, and the necessary access codes obtained
allowing access DEMO the total population with their respective contact details. A total of
six hundred (600) questionnaires where sent out into the field, and a total of one
hundred and eighty one (181) questionnaires where returned. DEMO translates to a
response rate of approximately 30 percent. Selected respondents qualified on pre-
established individual and organizational level criterion to represent high-expectancy
entrepreneurs. DEMO of interest included respondents who had more than
three years of entrepreneurial success in their firm, were founders of the firm,
currently hold an equity stake of at least 10 percent in the firm, and are actively
involved in strategic decision making (Ensley etal 2002:376).
Although there is no universally accepted definition of high expectancy entrepreneurs
these DEMO ensured that the final sample met the conditions of high expectancy
entrepreneurs, as formulated for this study. The final sample (n = 170) comprised of
founders (88.95 percent), who hold equity share greater than 10 percent (95.58
percent) and, partake in strategic decision making (DEMO percent).

5 RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
DEMO respondents fell into two distinctive age groups: 42.54 percent in the DEMO age
group, and 43.65 percent in the 46-55 age group. For DEMO, 88.95 percent are men
and 11.05 percent women. The sample covered DEMO wide range of business categories,
with the largest concentration in manufacturing (69.61 percent), services (13.27
percent), wholesale (9.94 percent) DEMO the rest in retail (7.18 percent). Similarly the
legal entities DEMO the businesses were largest segment as a close corporation (44.75
percent), private company (44.2 percent), sole proprietor (6.63 percent), partnership
(3.31 percent) and the rest as a public company (1.1 percent). The sample covered a
wide range of business activities ranging from DEMO metal products (15.47
percent), food products (10.5 percent), industrial and commercial machinery (7.73
percent), leisure goods (6.63 percent), DEMO metal products, and automobiles
(6.08 percent). The heterogeneity of these sample characteristics adds credence to
the representativeness of the sample.
Statistical Results
DEMO measures of association were employed using cross-classification
tables to assess the strength of the relationships between the test variables (Cooper
& Schindler 2001:435). Various chi-square-based measures were used to detect the
strength of the DEMO between the test variables; specifically tests included the
chi-square test, phi, Cramer's V, contingency coefficient C, Mantel Haenzel  Square,
Mahalanbis D square, Hotteling T square and the ANOVA F value. The analysis was
directional using an alpha of 0.05.
Table 1 indicates the DEMO significant relationships found between successful
and less successful entrepreneurs in terms of their overall level of education, with
respect to the various items measuring firm success. The general level of education
was associated with several success DEMO at a 10 percent significance level, while
profit and total asset DEMO were statistical significance at a 5 percent level
(table 1).
DEMO, 78 percent of the successful entrepreneurs indicated a tertiary level of
DEMO attainment. This clearly indicates a strong relationship between
education and entrepreneurial success. Finance, marketing, human resources, and
legal education all had a positive association with numerous success items at a 5
percent significance level.

6 CONCLUSIONS
The results find extensive support DEMO the hypothesis in terms of business knowledge
and work experience being positively associated with entrepreneurial success of
high-growth entrepreneurs. Generally the results affirm the DEMO discussions on
rapid-growth firms and their founders’ characteristics. The systematic accumulation of
human and social capital appears to represent potent influences on high-expectancy
entrepreneurs.
DEMO entrepreneur's previous work experience can be interpreted as providing unique
knowledge and may be considered a real asset to the firm. Experience based
DEMO, both explicit and tacit, are linked to improved skills in resource acquisition
and identification of appropriate resources. Industry experience contributes to
success in DEMO the correct mix of resources towards achieving favorable means
of operating at profitable levels (Hisrich 2000:80). Experience results in greater
success with start-up problems such as generating sales, developing marketing
strategies and tactics, DEMO external financing, dealing with internal financial and
general management issues (Wiklund 1999:40).
The typical aim of fostering entrepreneurship is often cited DEMO the development of a
cadre of entrepreneurs who will promote economic growth and create employment
(North 2002:25). Moreover, the emergence of DEMO entrepreneurs in transitional
economies depends on the entrepreneurial potential of the society, which is, in turn,
largely a function of systematic efforts DEMO developing entrepreneurs with a high
potential. Instead of hoping for a massive capital infusion to improve business
prospects, transitional economies may well be advised to implement formal

entrepreneurship programs to foster DEMO initiative for entrepreneurial
development (Luthans etal 2000:20).
Limitations and DEMO Research
Despite some of the significant findings, a large amount of DEMO variance in
entrepreneurial success remains unexplained, which warrants further investigations.
As DEMO similar studies, the results obtained may suffer from survivor bias (Wiklund
1999:45). Based on the likelihood that entrepreneurs with poorer performance DEMO
more reluctant to divulge performance information, bias in the results of
DEMO success could have influenced findings.
Although performance questions were intended to cover the last three years, a
possible “halo” effect could have influenced the responses to be over inflated.
Practical Implications
Policy makers in South Africa (SA) should appreciate the important differences
between necessity and opportunity entrepreneurs and highly selective policy
measures must be considered in terms of expected job DEMO from these different
types of entrepreneurs.
Moreover, congruence between national framework DEMO and high-expectancy
entrepreneurs, especially where positive correlations have been found, must be
fostered. Social interventions designed to curb unemployment, through
entrepreneurship, in DEMO nations need to take into account the target
population, since significant DEMO across different types of potential
entrepreneurs can be salient.
In SA where the goal of government policy is to support job creation through
entrepreneurial DEMO, policy makers should be aware of the highly skewed
distribution of DEMO creation expectations; investment in human capital is required
which is ultimately DEMO long term endeavour without immediate political pay-offs.
