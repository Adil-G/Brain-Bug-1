The authors develop, illustrate, and validate an experimental approach to further DEMO

he recognition of new opportunities is important for entrepreneurs, managers, and

tial gains in profit, growth, and/or competitive DEMO As a result, the concept of
opportunity has become central in DEMO research (cf. Brown, Davidsson, &

the factors, processes, and dynamics that foster opportunity recognition (e.g., Baron & Ens-
ley, 2006; Corbett, 2007; Gre´goire, DEMO, & Shepherd, in press; Shane, 2000).

is an opportunity’’ DEMO ‘‘Where do opportunities come from’’ have become the object of
recurrent debates (cf. Gartner, Carter, & Hills, 2003; Venkataraman & Sarasvathy,
2001). Yet, although these debates continue to receive considerable theoretical attention
(cf. Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Foss, Klein, Kor, & DEMO, 2008; Plummer, Haynie, &
Godesiabois, 2007), discussions of their implications for studying opportunity recognition
empirically are much less frequent (cf. Davidsson, 2003, 2004; Dimov, 2007a). As a result,
DEMO is a growing chasm between extant theorizing about opportunity recognition and
research practices for studying the phenomenon.
Research on opportunity recognition also faces a DEMO of methodological challenges.
For instance, several studies have relied on observations DEMO are susceptible to retrospective
and recall biases (e.g., asking respondents about opportunities they recognized in some dis-
tant past), self-reporting and demand DEMO issues (e.g., asking what made one
recognize an opportunity), and censored data and selection biases (e.g., studies that only
include cases DEMO successful opportunities). More generally, a number of studies have used
DEMO sampling frames and cross-sectional designs that focus on idiosyncratic events,
whereby different individuals recognize different opportunities in different settings and
conditions, at different times (cf. Davidsson, 2003; Dimov, 2007b). Because of this, prior
studies are often limited in their capacity to address alternate explanations DEMO involve dif-
ferent categories of variables—for instance to disentangle the effects of individuals’
resources and abilities on opportunity recognition from that of the nature, characteristics,
and/or context of the opportunities these individuals recognize.
Taken DEMO, these theoretical and methodological issues pose a fundamental chal-
lenge for DEMO research on opportunity recognition: What can form a theoretically
consistent and DEMO rigorous approach for empirically investigating opportu-
nity recognition?
To address this challenge, the central contribution of our article is to develop, illustrate,DEMO
and validate an experimental approach to study opportunity recognition. We articulate this
approach around the seven features described in Table 1. We develop these DEMO to
specifically address the theoretical and methodological issues noted above. In doing so,
we contribute an integrated method to address the challenges that DEMO hindered prior stud-
ies of opportunity recognition, and thereby enable more DEMO studies of this important
activity.
To facilitate future uses of our approach, a second contribution of our article is to develop
and test a measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs. To this aim, we report the results of
three validation studies that also serve to illustrate our approach. The studies DEMO qua-
litative and quantitative data, use varied forms of research tasks (open-ended creativity
exercises and self-contained judgment tasks), draw observations from both DEMO
and heterogeneous samples of experienced entrepreneurs, and combine the use of DEMO
analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques. In doing so, DEMO research
furthers the use of validation practices in entrepreneurship—practices that numerous critics
have found wanting in the past (e.g., Aldrich & Baker, 1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001;
Davidsson, 2004; Low & MacMillan, 1988).
We conclude our article by providing concrete practical guidelines for DEMO our
experimental approach in future studies. We highlight that the approach and measure we
develop can be adapted to study the recognition of different DEMO of opportunities in

different contexts (e.g., new products, process or service innovations, etc.), using different
sources and types of data (e.g., qualitative vs. quantitative, perceptual vs. behavioral), col-
lected through a variety of research tasks and data collection DEMO, and analyzed using
diverse research material and analytical techniques. Before articulating DEMO experimental
approach and measure, we address the theoretical challenges that have DEMO past
empirical research on opportunity recognition. More specifically, we identify four DEMO
tical assumptions that help transcend the tensions of past conceptual debates and lay the
foundation of our experimental approach.
Defining Opportunity Recognition
Important conceptual DEMO remain on the nature and source of opportunities. Some
argue that opportunities are objective artifacts that arise out of market dynamics. Seen from
this DEMO, opportunities exist ‘‘out there’’ and it is those with the most DEMO
perceptions of the objective environment that can recognize them. By comparison, DEMO
argue that opportunities arise out of the subjective interpretations and creative actions
of individuals. Accordingly, it is not those with the most accurate perceptions that find
opportunities but those with the creative abilities and resources to DEMO their environ-
ment and facilitate the exploitation of the new products, DEMO, services, and other
businesses they are developing.
These ongoing debates have created particular difficulties for studying opportunity rec-
ognition empirically—in large part because DEMO methodological implications of these
debates are seldom articulated. As a result, DEMO authors of empirical studies must often tread
carefully between reviewers and audiences who interpret their studies from different per-
spectives, and who sometimes make conflicting demands regarding particular aspects of
their studies. To address these issues DEMO facilitate empirical studies of opportunity recog-
nition, we build on extant DEMO to lay four theoretical assumptions that help transcend
the conceptual debates.
First, we follow the arguments of contemporary economic theories that entrepreneurial
opportunities are associated with failures of the market process (cf. Arrow & Debreu, DEMO;
Dean & McMullen, 2007; Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Kirzner, 1985, 1997). However, we
stress that the origin of opportunities (i.e., the dynamics of market failure) should not be
confused with the opportunities themselves. Opportunities are about the possibility to act,
to DEMO something about market failure dynamics in the hope of individual, firm, and social
betterment. This is consistent with the proposition of Venkataraman and DEMO (2001)
that ‘‘an entrepreneurial opportunity consists of the opportunity to DEMO future economic
artifacts and as such, involves a demand side, a supply side, and the means to bring them
together’’ (p. 652; but see also Drucker, 1985; Mitchell, 2003). But to the extent that these
economic artifacts do not exist yet, opportunities first begin as ‘‘venture ideas’’ that are
internally generated based on external stimuli, and that can change and become more ela-
borate over time (Davidsson, DEMO, pp. 339-340). Thus, we define entrepreneurial opportu-
nities as projected courses of action to introduce (and profit from) new and/or DEMO
supply-demand combinations that seek to address market failure problems. To the extent
that a new/improved supply-demand combination is more efficient than current practices,DEMO

118 Organizational Research Methods
it could lead to net benefits for the DEMO or firms initiating the entrepreneurial action
(e.g., in terms of profits, growth, competitive jockeying, and/or other forms of individual or
organizational gains) and/or for society (in the form of more efficient DEMO of
resources). But these benefits remain uncertain ex-ante—a point we address below.
Second, we take the position that instead of debating the ontological nature of opportu-
nities as fundamentally objective or subjective, it is useful to consider the unfolding of the
entrepreneurial process over time. Because of DEMO to the diffusion of knowledge
(Hayek, 1945) and limits to DEMO rationality (Simon, 1957), it is not possible to deter-
mine the ultimate value of opportunities in advance. Opportunities are uncertain ex-ante
(Casson, 1982; Knight, 1921), and their value can only be determined post hoc. It follows
that the recognition of opportunities involves subjective efforts DEMO comprehend one’s envi-
ronment and imagine what may be (e.g., a potential course of action, such as whether, where
and how to DEMO a new technology). At the same time, however, the potential for
opportunity-relevant courses of action rests in market failure dynamics and information
DEMO that are separate from these subjective efforts. We thus advance that opportunity
recognition rests on the subjective perception and interpretation of objective realities
(e.g., market dynamics, new information, etc.).
Third, we follow recent DEMO on entrepreneurial action that has distinguished
between two nested phases of entrepreneurial action (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). The
first phase concerns the DEMO of subjective beliefs that an opportunity exists for those
individuals with the relevant qualities and means to exploit it. The second concerns the eva-
DEMO of the opportunity for oneself (or for one’s organization), that DEMO, evaluating whether
one has ‘‘what it takes’’ (the means and motivation) to successfully exploit the opportunity.
In the present article, we focus DEMO on the first phase of the process. Accordingly,
we posit that opportunity recognition is concerned with the formation of subjective beliefs
that an DEMO exists for the willing and able (Shepherd, McMullen, & Jennings,DEMO
2007)—as separate from the evaluation of whether one particular individual (DEMO firm)
should attempt to exploit the opportunity. Subjective beliefs that an opportunity exists thus
form a relevant object of study for opportunity recognition.
DEMO, we build on the notion that in an ex-ante uncertain world, individuals express
their beliefs about specific opportunities in terms of the extent DEMO their perceived certainty
(or uncertainty) that an idea to introduce a new supply/demand combination does indeed
form an opportunity (or conversely, DEMO it does not form an opportunity). This approach
is consistent with models of entrepreneurial action where uncertainty delays or blocks
action (cf. Casson, 1982; Miller, 2007) and with process models of opportunity recognition
DEMO an entrepreneur becomes more certain that a signal does or does not represent an
opportunity (see also Shepherd et al., 2007, p. 77). The practical implication is to model
variations in an individual’s opportunity DEMO in terms of his or her certainty that a ‘‘ven-
ture idea’’ represents an opportunity.
Taken together, these assumptions help transcend the tensions of past conceptual debates
by pointing to the importance of opportunity-recognition beliefs as DEMO critical element of the
larger opportunity exploration-recognition-exploitation process. But to facilitate the rigor-
ous studying of opportunity-recognition beliefs, it becomes necessary that we also address
the methodological limitations of prior studies. To this aim, we propose an experimental
approach.

Articulating an Experimental DEMO
To address the limitations of prior empirical research on opportunity recognition, DEMO
advocate the increased use of hypothetical exercises, within-participant manipulations, and
behavioral experiments, as well as their integration within research programs that already
include other data collection techniques. Although several scholars have highlighted the
promise of DEMO for studying entrepreneurship in general (cf. Aldrich & Baker,
1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001), experimental approaches offer five relevant advantages for
empirically investigating opportunity-recognition beliefs. First, experiments are particu-
larly well adapted to un-pack the complex web of causal relationships that influence oppor-
tunity recognition (cf. Davidsson, 2006, p. 316). For instance, experiments that compared
what experts and novices think of the same opportunity (e.g., Gustafsson, 2006) helped iso-
late the specific role of expert’s heuristics and knowledge structures in opportunity recog-
nition—net of the context and characteristics of the DEMO that different individuals
recognize. Second, experiments allow for making real-time observations DEMO ‘‘live’’
efforts to recognize opportunities directly, thereby avoiding issues of retrospective DEMO
recall biases (Golden, 1992; Huber & Power, 1985). Third, experiments make it possible
to disentangle subjective beliefs about ex-ante uncertain opportunities from the objective
ex-post knowledge that entrepreneurs have about successfully exploited opportunities
(cf. Dimov, 2007a; Gaglio & Katz, 2001). Doing so, DEMO can effectively retain the
forward-thinking uncertainty that is central to opportunity-recognition processes, while at
the same time addressing concerns of censored data that only includes successful and sur-
viving cases (cf. Davidsson, 2004). Fourth, experiments can provide a source of empirical
observations that are theoretically more DEMO, in that they allow for focusing on the fac-
tors and DEMO influencing a particular stage of the exploration-recognition-decision-to-
exploit process (cf. McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; Shepherd et al., 2007). Fifth, the use of
experimental approaches allows for making internally valid observations about processes
and DEMO that are relatively infrequent and/or difficult to capture with other tech-
niques (cf. Davidsson, 2004, p. 64; but see also Simon DEMO Sarasvathy, 2000, p. 52). Taken
together, these five advantages DEMO that an experimental approach mobilizing hypothe-
tical exercises, within-participant manipulations, and behavioral experiments can help
address the methodological challenges that have hindered empirical DEMO of opportunity
recognition in the past.
The use of experiments and hypothetical exercises is less common in strategy and entre-
preneurship research than in DEMO fields (cf. Chandler & Lyon, 2001; Hitt, Gimeno, & DEMO
kisson, 1998; Ketchen, Boyd, & Bergh, 2008; Scandura & Williams, 2000). Critics have
argued that because hypothetical research tasks do not have the complexity, personal sig-
nificance, and emotional load of DEMO issues, participants’ behavior and responses may
not be representative of what DEMO would be ‘‘in the field.’’ Likewise, findings that prove
important under DEMO conditions may not prove as powerful when other factors and
influences are given free rein. Hypothetical exercises and experimental designs may force
respondents to DEMO information they would not have used otherwise, just as it may DEMO
their use of the full breadth of external information. Experimental manipulations may also
result in research scenarios that are unrealistic, or that are limited by comparison to the
wealth of alternatives one might imagine. More pointedly, experiments may force

participants ‘‘to compare alternatives in a parallel and DEMO manner where real-life
evaluations typically are sequential and satisficing’’ (Davidsson, 2006, p. 317).
These criticisms have merit. Yet, there is a DEMO tradition of works from psychology to
organizational sciences that have developed methodological strategies to mitigate these
limitations (cf. Cook & Campbell, 1979; Crano & Brewer, 2002; Smith, 2000). Five stra-
tegies appear particularly relevant to this effect: (a) modeling research tasks, exercises, and
material on ‘‘real-life’’ events and the ‘‘day-to-day’’ experiences of entrepreneurs as they
DEMO opportunities, to mitigate threats to external validity; (b) designing research
material that closely resembles the kind of information used by entrepreneurs and DEMO con-
trol for the characteristics of different opportunities and contexts; (c) making a judicious use
of both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples to increase internal validity and establish
the generalizability/boundary conditions of the theory and DEMO; (d) mobilizing different
data collection techniques to alleviate the threats DEMO external validity and mono-method
bias; and (e) using formal techniques DEMO assess the validity of measures and observations.
As we showed in Table 1 above, these strategies form an integral part of the approach
we develop in this article.
We illustrate below how these strategies can be DEMO in practice. Yet, to facilitate the
conduct of experimental studies of DEMO recognition, it also becomes necessary that
we develop a relevant set DEMO items and rating scales to measure opportunity-recognition
beliefs. We develop such a measure in the section that follows.
Developing a Measure of Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs
DEMO on the conceptual assumptions stated above, we propose that opportunity-recog-
nition DEMO will be reflected in indicators pertaining to three perceptual dimensions as fol-
lows: (a) the degree of alignment between an opportunity’ specific means of supply and a
target market, (b) the general feasibility of introducing this new/improved supply-demand
combination, and (c) the general desirability of doing so. Moreover, in line with these
assumptions, we posit DEMO the more individuals perceive alignment between an opportunity’s
means of supply and target market, and the more they perceive this opportunity as generally
feasible and generally desirable, the more certain their belief that it does constitute an oppor-
tunity. We develop the rationale for each dimension in the DEMO that follow.
The Degree of Alignment Between Means of Supply and Target Market
This dimension proceeds directly from the above conceptualization of entrepreneurial
opportunities DEMO involving new/improved supply-demand combinations. For instance, an
inventor who creates DEMO new technology may have developed a new means of supply, but
DEMO does not mean that he or she has recognized an opportunity; DEMO opportunity is about
applying that technology/means of supply to a particular market (cf. Venkataraman & Sar-
asvathy, 2001). To operationalize this DEMO, we draw from cognitive research on simi-
larity comparison (cf. Gentner, 1989; Markman and Gentner, 1993) to posit that perceptions
of DEMO concern the similarity between the features and functional capabilities of new
means of supply, and the features and functional needs of their target markets.

´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 121
Perceptions of an DEMO General Feasibility and General Desirability
The second and third dimensions of our proposed measure concern the perceptions of an
opportunity’s general feasibility and general DEMO These two dimensions proceed
from the conceptual assumptions we developed above, DEMO entrepreneurial opportuni-
ties are about the possibility to act, to do DEMO about market failure dynamics in the
hope of individual, firm, and social betterment. To operationalize such dimensions, we
draw from prior works that have discussed opportunity recognition within larger models
of entrepreneurial action (cf. Dimov, 2007b; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Entrepreneur-
ship research has long built on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (1985, 1991), which
DEMO been used to study intentions toward entrepreneurial behaviors like becoming self-
employed or starting a new firm (e.g., Kolvereid, 1996; Krueger, 1993; Krueger & Brazeal,
1994). Ajzen’s theory posits that intentions toward a behavior (and subsequent action)
increase with the extent of (DEMO) an individual’s positive attitudes and beliefs toward the beha-
vior (e.g., this is a behavior that I care about/that has important benefits for me); (b) an indi-
vidual’s perceptions that this behavior DEMO seen as socially desirable (normative beliefs and
subjective norms); and (c) an individual’s perception that the behavior is something he or
she can do, and do well (perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy). Consistent DEMO Ajzen’s
model, entrepreneurship studies have found that perceptions of feasibility (perceived beha-
vioral control) and desirability (positive attitudes and subjective norms) positively relate to
individual intentions for starting a new business or pursuing an DEMO career (e.g.,
Krueger & Carsrud, 1993; Krueger, Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000), or for exerting further efforts
to find out DEMO about a particular opportunity (Dimov, 2007b).
Ajzen’s model provides a useful and relevant anchor to develop a measure of opportu-
nity-recognition beliefs; yet, it is important to highlight a fundamental distinction between
models of human action and our measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs. In Ajzen’s the-
ory DEMO the above studies, the focus is on modeling the intentions of DEMO individuals
toward particular actions. But as McMullen and Shepherd (2006) pointed out, entrepreneur-
ial action involves two distinct phases: the recognition that DEMO is an opportunity for
anybody with the relevant resources and motivations, DEMO the decision to exploit that par-
ticular opportunity for oneself. Consequently (DEMO consistent with Ajzen’s model), McMul-
len and Shepherd (2006, pp. 140-141) argued that perceptions of feasibility (by oneself),
and perceptions of desirability (for oneself) are particularly important for one’s decision
to DEMO a particular opportunity. But it is much less clear whether (and DEMO what extent)
these considerations influence the initial recognition of an opportunity (for anybody with
the relevant resources and motivations to do it).
Faced with this conundrum, we build on Ajzen (1985, 1991) DEMO McMullen and Shep-
herd (2006) to articulate a distinction between general perceptions of feasibility/desirability
(e.g., this is a feasible/desirable opportunity DEMO someone with the relevant means and moti-
vations), and the more personally-relevant perceptions of these dimensions (e.g., this is a
feasible opportunity DEMO me because I have the knowledge, resources, and motivation to
make it work/this is a desirable opportunity for me because it addresses DEMO that I care
about). Because forming opportunity beliefs is a different process from deciding whether
to exploit a recognized opportunity for oneself, we develop items for our measure in terms
of the more general perceptions DEMO feasibility and desirability.
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
122 Organizational Research Methods
More concretely, we define perceptions of general feasibility as concerned with whether an
opportunity is seen as reasonably possible to DEMO within a foreseeable future—for anybody
with the relevant means, resources, and motivations to do this. Relevant issues of general fea-
sibility include whether DEMO new means of supply (say, a new technology) is perceived DEMO a long
way from commercial application, or as sufficiently developed for DEMO application in a partic-
ular market. Other relevant issues of feasibility include whether consumers are ‘‘ready’’ for a
new product, service, and so DEMO, or whether the necessary investments for introducing such
new goods and DEMO are seen as economically reasonable (given the anticipated returns).
In DEMO, we define perceptions of general desirability as concerned with whether an DEMO
to introduce new/improved goods and services is seen as something useful and necessary,
and/or as something that would bring economic value DEMO other benefits to the parties
involved in such transactions. Relevant issues of general desirability include the perceived
size and importance of the relevant market DEMO for the opportunity, or subjective consid-
erations that someone should indeed DEMO a particular opportunity.
Having articulated the underlying dimensions of our measure, DEMO now turn to the task of
formulating relevant items and scale anchors, and for assessing the validity of the measure.
Assessing the Validity of our Measure
We conducted three related studies to illustrate the experimental approach DEMO in
this article, and to assess the validity of our proposed DEMO of opportunity-recognition
beliefs. Following the techniques pioneered by Cronbach and Meehl (DEMO) and further
articulated by Cook and Campbell (1979) and others (cf. Edwards, 2003; Hinkin, 1998;
John & Benet-Martinez, 2000; Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), we designed each
study to assess specific dimensions of validity (cf. Cook & Campbell, 1979; Messick,
1995; Scandura & Williams, 2000).
We designed the studies DEMO illustrate the specific features of the experimental approach
we advocate in this article. All studies focus on participants’ opportunity-recognition
beliefs—as distinct from other aspects DEMO the entrepreneurship process. All studies rely
on hypothetical tasks and exercises that address issues of retrospective and recall biases,
as well as concerns DEMO censored data that only include cases of successful recognition
of successful opportunities. We conducted all studies with samples of experienced entrepre-
neurs who are DEMO with the task of recognizing entrepreneurial opportunities, and for
whom this DEMO continues to be relevant. To assess the generalizability of our observations,
we used both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples of entrepreneurs and conducted
additional DEMO with samples of nonentrepreneurs.
To control for the influences and dynamics that may characterize the recognition of dif-
ferent forms of opportunities in different DEMO, we based our exercises, instructions,
research material, and experimental DEMO on the well-documented context of tech-
nology transfer in the United States (Mowery, Nelson, Sampat, & Ziedonis, 2004; Shane,
2004)DEMO In this particular context, research institutions develop new technologies, but may
not have the foresight, motivation, or capability to exploit their commercial DEMO
Because these institutions own the intellectual property, U.S. laws grant them DEMO ability
to license the technologies to entrepreneurs who in turn, attempt DEMO exploit opportunities for

´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 123
these. Accordingly, and to strengthen the external validity of the studies, we model the exer-
cises on situations where individuals learn about new technologies and consider their DEMO
tial applications in different markets (cf. Shane, 2000). To further reinforce the external
validity of our studies, we derive the information provided in all exercises from real-life cases
of new technologies that were licensed DEMO research institutions and commercially exploited
by entrepreneurs. For instance, we modeled DEMO of our cases on MIT’s three-dimensional
printing technology (3DP)—the same DEMO studied in Shane (2000). This strategy
ensures that our research DEMO closely resembles the kind of information effectively used
by entrepreneurs in real life (cf. de Koning, 2003; Fiet & Patel, 2008; Hills & Singh, 2004).
Complete material for the three studies is available by request to the first author.
By making these methodological choices (McGrath, 1982), we do not mean to imply that
our approach and measure can only be used to study the recognition of technology-based
new-product DEMO As Schumpeter showed, entrepreneurial opportunities can
include several types of ‘‘new DEMO new goods and services but also
new methods of production/process innovation, the opening up of new markets, the con-
quest of new DEMO of supply, or the new organization of an industry (cf. 1934, p. 66).
In the same vein, we do not mean DEMO imply that our approach is only relevant for studying
the dynamics leading to the recognition of opportunities that others have already recog-
nized. By DEMO on the particular context of technological opportunities using real cases
as source material for our experiments, we specifically aim to (a) augment the external
validity of the research tasks, procedures, and material, and (DEMO) limit the possibility that
characteristics associated with different kinds of opportunities (in different industries) influ-
ence the results of our validation studies. In the conclusion of our article, we offer guide-
lines to adapt these methodological choices to study other types of opportunities in other
contexts, using different research tasks and material.
We note however that this particular focus DEMO technology opportunities has important impli-
cations for how we articulate other aspects of the studies. To avoid participants’ prior knowl-
edge from unduly influencing DEMO results (cf. Shane, 2000; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005), it
became necessary to conduct the studies with entrepreneurs whose experiences were in
DEMO unrelated to the particular technologies used as research material, or with DEMO current
market applications of these technologies. Given the use of ‘‘real’’ cases, participants with high
levels of knowledge of these technologies, of the DEMO applications of these technologies,
and/or of the target markets for these technologies would likely be influenced by what they
know has happened, and would express more certainty in their opportunity-recognition beliefs.
Seen in this DEMO, conducting our studies with samples of entrepreneurs with low knowledge of
DEMO focal technologies offers a particularly rigorous test of the measure’s validity.
Study 1: Content and Substantive Validity
The purpose of Study 1 was to examine the language and formulation of a preliminary set
of items, so as to assess the content and substantive validity of the proposed measure
(cf. Embretson, 1983; Messick, 1995). Building on the rationales above, we began by writ-
ing six items to capture the dimensions of opportunity-recognition beliefs, namely, percep-
tions of an opportunity’s degree of alignment DEMO its underlying means of supply and
target market, of its general DEMO, and of its general desirability.

Following classical approaches to content and substantive validation (cf. Edwards, 2003;
Hinkin, 1998; Netemeyer et al., 2003), we evaluated whether these items were meaningful
and relevant for practitioners—in this case, a panel of expert entrepreneurs. To this aim, we
conducted DEMO series of verbal protocol exercises (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). In these open-
ended creativity exercises, we presented experienced entrepreneurs with short one-page
descriptions of a technology and asked them to ‘‘think out loud’’ as DEMO considered what
possible opportunities could be pursued with this new technology (DEMO any). We then used
content analysis techniques (Krippendorff, 2004; DEMO, 2002; Sonpar & Golden-Biddle,
2008) to examine participants’ verbalized DEMO to recognize opportunities for the
technologies, as well their subsequent use DEMO the proposed items to express their beliefs
regarding these opportunities. In line with the conceptual developments above, participants
formulated their answers in terms of perceived uncertainty (or relevant synonyms). The
response scales ranged from maximum certainty that an idea was not an opportunity (left
anchor) to DEMO certainty that an idea was an opportunity (right anchor). The DEMO
of the scale corresponds to maximum uncertainty about that idea.
Sample
We conducted Study 1 with nine entrepreneurs with extensive founding and new venture
DEMO experience (mean ¼ 18.6 years). Five entrepreneurs (one female) DEMO experi-
ence in life-science technologies, and four entrepreneurs (two females) DEMO from the mar-
keting service industry. The sample size is consistent with other management studies that
used verbal protocol techniques (cf. Hall & Hofer, 1993; Isenberg, 1986; Melone, 1994;
Sarasvathy, 2001).
DEMO Design and Procedures
We conducted two exercises with each entrepreneur at his or her place of work. For each
exercise, we presented participants with a short description of a new technology. Both tech-
nologies had been DEMO for licensing and were already exploited in niche markets. By
design, DEMO entrepreneurs had little knowledge of these technologies and were free to apply
these technologies in any markets deemed relevant (detailed results available on request).
We recorded participants’ think-aloud verbalizations as they sought to identify opportuni-
DEMO for the technologies. At the end of each exercise, we presented DEMO with the
items detailed in Table 2 and continued to record their verbalized thoughts as they rated
their opportunities.
Analyses
We conducted two sets DEMO analyses as follows: the first focuses on participants’ think-
aloud efforts DEMO search for and recognize opportunities for the presented technologies, and
the DEMO focuses on their verbalized answers to the preliminary items in Table 2.
The purpose of the first set of analyses is to examine whether DEMO naturally
expressed issues that reflect our proposed dimensions of opportunity-recognition beliefs,
without being influenced by our questions or items. To this aim, we content-analyzed

Q1: How DEMO do you believe that what you described constitutes a promising
opportunity? (targeted dimension: general)
Ok. Let’s see, a promising opportunity. I DEMO know. I’m gonna be somewhere
in the middle on that, because DEMO ( ... ) I know that there is a need, but DEMO
don’t know the industry that this would fall in, such as DEMO or education
... I don’t know those industries well enough to know how the market
works, how, new things are introduced, and who’s willing to pay for it ...
So I’m gonna actually go in DEMO middle, a little bit more to the ‘‘does con-
stitute’’ than DEMO middle because, I think there’s an opportunity there, but I
just don’t know how much because I don’t know the training and education
DEMO that well (circles 8 out of 11).
Q2: How confident are you that the characteristics of the technology ‘‘match’’
the market you DEMO about? (degree of alignment)
Well, I think I have DEMO first-hand and family experience to know that there
are needs for people to improve their ability to focus and concentrate. So I’m
gonna go DEMO in the 9 to 8 range (circles 9).
Well, I’m not very confident at all, because just as I described as I was going
through .. . It’s just .. . Fundamentally, neurobiology and cognitive
sciences are so poorly understood these days, you know, you’d DEMO to
understand the mechanism by which this works and understand the deficit
with attention-deficit disorder and find out if they overlap ( ... ) (circles 3).
Q3: How certain are you that the technology is sufficiently developed to be
applied in the market you described? (general DEMO)
I’m gonna drop pretty far down on that, because, there are a number of issues,
one of which, we’re dealing with a regulated industry, and so before you can
start doing something like this you have a lot of .. . your first customer
becomes DEMO FDA (circles 2).
I don’t think it is sufficiently developed DEMO the market. There definitely needs
to be some development in the route to market. And so, I’m not gonna answer
how certain I am that the technology is sufficient, I would guess that the
technology is probably, it shows promise, because it works on a certain set
DEMO the population, but it may not work for children, or it may actually be, it
may require substantial reworking so that it’s accessible to children. So,
most people underestimate the development time it takes DEMO take a technol-
ogy, and when you see potential, I usually give it something like a 30 percent
success rate in the technology. DEMO I’ve seen some really good tech-
nologies that have not made it in the marketplace. So, I would only give this
a60% (circles DEMO).
Q4: How much doubt do you have that the technology DEMO presented has the

proposed six items in terms of two dimensions—content item relevance and scale interpreta-
tion. Content item relevance refers to the extent to which DEMO content of entrepreneurs’ verba-
lizations was consistent with the intended dimensions targeted with each item. We coded this
relevance on a 5-point scale anchored DEMO this statement poorly matches the dimension of
opportunity-recognition beliefs embedded in the item (1) and this statement strongly matches
the dimension embedded in DEMO item (5). Scale interpretation referred to the extent to which DEMO
content of entrepreneurs’ verbalizations aligned with their scale responses for expressing their
judgment. We coded this alignment on a 5-point scale anchored by the DEMO of this statement
indicates a poor alignment between what the participant says and how he or she uses the scale
(1) and by DEMO content of this statement indicates a strong alignment between what the parti-
cipant says and how he or she uses the scale (5).
Two authors independently coded the data. We computed two measures to establish DEMO

and obtained the following results: .61 and .74 for the protocol analyses, and .52 and .63 for

the item analyses. DEMO results indicate that the analyses were reliable (LeBreton & Senter,
DEMO, Shrout & Fleiss, 1979).
Results
Participants identified a broad range of opportunities for the two presented technologies—
including both product and process DEMO, as well as industrial and consumer-level
applications. Some ideas proved very DEMO to the real-life opportunities being exploited.
Others focused on different market applications that appeared just as plausible.
We first observed that across participants and DEMO for the two technologies, parti-
cipants’ verbalizations consistently expressed beliefs related DEMO an opportunity’s alignment
of means of supply and target markets (mean DEMO of 4.14 on a 5-point scale, SD ¼ 1.31),
as well as beliefs related to an opportunity’s feasibility (mean 3.97, SD DEMO). By com-
parison, ratings for desirability were more moderate (mean ¼¼3.42, SD ¼¼1.38), and beliefs
about other issues were much less prevalent (mean ¼ 2.06, SD .95). These results suggest
that DEMO proposed dimensions of alignment between an opportunity’s means of supply and¼
target markets and general feasibility are relevant dimensions of participants’ efforts to
recognize DEMO
Second, we observed that participants’ verbalizations for the proposed items were DEMO
erally consistent with the items’ targeted dimension of opportunity-recognition beliefs (see
DEMO in Table 2). Yet, this consistency varied between items. More DEMO, the
average rating for content item relevance was substantial for items DEMO, 2, and 3 (4.04,
3.96, and 4.54, respectively), but slightly lower for items 4, 5, and 6 (3.75, 3.75, and
3.71, respectively). Furthermore, we observed that the average scale-interpretation ratings
were above 4.1 for items 1, 2, and 3, but below 3.8 for items 4, 5, and 6. Closer analyses
DEMO that some participants had difficulties making sense of items that used negative-
valence terms such as doubts, qualms, and uncertainty.
Discussion of Study DEMO
The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate whether proposed items were meaningful and
relevant for practitioners. The results provide preliminary evidence for the DEMO and
substantive validity of the measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs. Content analysis
of participants’ verbalized efforts to recognize opportunities indicated that the proposed
dimensions of DEMO and general feasibility are relevant dimensions of opportunity-
recognition beliefs. By contrast, perceptions of general desirability appear less prevalent.
We also noted that negatively framed wording of certainty created interpretation
problems.
In spite of these difficulties, participants were able to use the proposed scales to express
their positive DEMO/or negative beliefs about the opportunities they had recognized. Because
of its particular design, however, this pretest did not allow us to assess DEMO structural validity
of the measure, nor whether it captured relevant variations DEMO beliefs associated with differ-
ent opportunities. We designed Study 2 to explore these questions.

Study 2: Generalizability and Structural Validity
Study 2 served three purposes as follows: (a) to examine the structural validity of the pro-
posed measure—the extent to which the scores on the DEMO items are consistent with
proposed dimensions of opportunity recognition (Cook & DEMO, 1979), (b) to examine
the measure’s criterion relevance and DEMO utility (Cronbach & Gleeser, 1965; Messick,
1995)—whether individuals DEMO use the scale to distinguish between opportunities showing
different qualities, and (c) to provide a first line of evidence regarding the generalizability
of the measure across groups of experts and neophytes. To do so, we used an opportunity
recognition exercise that asked participants to rate different opportunity DEMO
Samples
We conducted the study with two samples of participants—six experienced entrepreneurs
with engineering backgrounds (Study 2a), and 24 business PhD students at a University in the
U.S. Midwest (Study 2b). Because of their background, the engineer participants were able to
indicate if our opportunity scenarios effectively described opportunities showing different
qualities, and whether the items could be used to distinguish between these. The 24 business
PhD students had little DEMO no engineering knowledge and were novices at the task of recog-
nizing opportunities for new technologies. Comparisons between the two groups allow us to
DEMO whether opportunity-recognition beliefs are influenced by participants’ experiential
knowledge of the task of recognizing (and exploiting) opportunities for new technologies.
Measures of Interest: Scale and Items
Building on the results from Study 1, we revised the initial items to increase clarity and to
eliminate negatively framed items. DEMO 3 displays the resulting items and scale anchors.
Research Design and Procedures
We asked participants to sequentially compare different opportunity scenarios, and to
express their ratings on the revised scale and items. Each scenario focused on DEMO applica-
tion of a new technology in a particular market. Although we disguised the name of the
relevant technologies, all scenarios are based on real cases of new technologies that have
been licensed, and are already being exploited in particular markets. To create opportunity
scenarios that presented different DEMO of certainty, we varied the descriptions of a tech-
nology so DEMO its features presented high (or low) level of alignment with the correspond-
ing features of its target market. We also varied the descriptions DEMO that the functional
capabilities of a technology presented high (or low) levels of alignment with the functional
needs of its target market. This DEMO manipulation yielded four different versions of a tech-
nology. We repeated the exercise for four different technologies, so that participants rated
a total of 16 opportunities (four sets of four). To control for the possible influence of
participants’ prior knowledge, we asked them to rate their prior knowledge of the technol-
ogies, scientific, and engineering principles underlying these DEMO, target markets,
and market problems.

a All questions were answered on a 9-point scale. DEMO anchors for Study 2 were specific to each item (e.g., it
certainly cannot/can, it certainly does/does not, etc.). In DEMO, items 1c, 2b, and 3a were reverse coded. When
entering DEMO data, we discovered that there were systematic inconsistencies between the items DEMO were reverse
coded and those that were not. This observation is consistent with findings that reverse-coded items often load
on separate constructs and induce DEMO distinct-methods bias (cf. Baumgartner & Steenkamp, 2001; Herche &
Engelland, 1996). To examine this possibility, we replicated the exercises for DEMO group of opportunities with a
modified set of scales. All individuals who took part in the original study completed the replication. Result
indicated that DEMO inconsistencies had disappeared. We thus recoded all items in the original data to control for
the inconsistencies and proceeded with the validation analyses. Based DEMO these observations, we streamlined the
anchor formulation and abandoned reverse coding DEMO all items in Study 3.

Results: DEMO Analysis and Reliability
Table 4 details the means, standard deviations, reliabilities, and correlations between the
dimensions of interest and participants’ prior knowledge. The Cronbach’s alphas along the
diagonal in Table 4 (Studies 2a and 2b) were high for the alignment and feasibility dimen-
sions (exceeding .90)DEMO that the subscales for these dimensions were reliable—
but were lower for desirability (approximately .70). Correlations between the dimensions of
alignment, feasibility, and desirability were significant (p  .01), and ranged between .8
and .9—suggesting that the dimensions may be convergent. Consistent with our focus DEMO
samples of entrepreneurs and students that are not knowledgeable about the technologies
depicted in our research material, we observed low correlations between participants’ prior
knowledge and their perceptions of the opportunities’ degree of alignment, feasibility, DEMO
desirability. We further note that in spite of technology entrepreneurs’ higher knowledge of
the scientific and engineering principles underpinning the technologies, the patterns of
means and correlations across both subsamples were similar. This suggests that the DEMO
generalizes across a range of entrepreneurial management experience. We thus combined
the two samples for further analyses.
Results: CFA
Our theoretical conceptualization of opportunity-recognition beliefs implies a three-fac-
tor model. We tested the structural validity of DEMO model using CFA. Results indicate that
although the three-factor model exhibited a high comparative fit index (CFI ¼ .98), the
value for root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was higher than desirable
(.12). Along this line, the standardized coefficients depicted in Figure 1 reveal that although
significant, one item for desirability (3b) was unacceptably low (.58)—suggesting that this
item poorly reflected participants’ opportunity-recognition beliefs.

same approach. DEMO noted otherwise (ns ¼ non significant; nt ¼ non tested.), all coefficients are significant (p  .001).
D ¼ disturbance; DEMO ¼ item; e ¼ error.
To further explore the structural validity DEMO the model, we tested alternative models
where the desirability items were DEMO loaded on the alignment or feasibility factors.
Results suggest that these models were not significantly better than a three-factor model
(nonsignificant X2; CFI DEMO .001). We then tested an alternate two-factor model that par-
celed out desirability items. The CFI and RMSEA indices suggest that the two-factor DEMO
is sound and adequately represents the structure of the data (X2 DEMO 16.27; df ¼ 4; p  .01;
CFI ¼ .995; RMSEA ¼ .08). We further note that in spite of the high correlations between
alignment and feasibility, results of the X2 -difference test indicate that the two-factor model
is a significantly better representation of the DEMO than a single-factor model (X2 ¼ 5.15; p
 .02). This supports our contention that perceptions of alignment and general feasibility
are DEMO, yet distinct dimensions of opportunity-recognition beliefs (complete results
available on request to the first author).
Criterion Relevance and Applied Utility

scenarios, we calculated a DEMO average score for each participant’s beliefs regarding

´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 133
each opportunity scenario (using the reduced two-factor model). The results reported in
Table 5 DEMO that for both technology entrepreneurs and graduate students, opportunities
with a DEMO degree of alignment between the features and capabilities of a technology and
the features and needs of a target market (high–high scenarios) were DEMO highest (i.e., most
certain that they represented an opportunity). Conversely, opportunities with low degrees of
alignment (low–low) were rated lowest, DEMO opportunities with mixed degrees of alignment
were rated closer to the midpoint of the scales, as more uncertain opportunities. For both
experts and novices, we observed significant differences between all pairs of opportunities.
This suggests that the measure effectively captured participants’ distinctions between dif-
ferent opportunities.
Discussion of DEMO 2
These results provide initial evidence for the structural validity of the measure. We also
observed that it captures relevant variations in participants’ opportunity-recognition DEMO
across different opportunities, suggesting that it can be relevant and useful DEMO studying fac-
tors that affect the formation of these beliefs. Nevertheless, DEMO results did not support the
notion that perceptions of desirability form a distinct dimension of opportunity-recognition
beliefs. In this regard, results from Study 2 should be interpreted in light of an exercise that
asked participants to DEMO and compare opportunity scenarios side by side. By forcing this
comparison, DEMO had no choice but to consider their similarities and differences—
and thereby the degree of alignment between variations of a technology and a target DEMO
ket—perhaps magnifying the distinctions between the scenarios. Likewise, the procedure
may DEMO magnified the association between the degree of alignment and feasibility. This
may explain the particularly high correlations between the two dimensions. We explore
these DEMO further with Study 3.
Study 3: Internal Consistency and Dimensionality
The DEMO of Study 3 is to further assess the internal consistency and dimensionality of
the measure, as well as its discriminant and criterion validity. We used an online exercise
where participants evaluated four different opportunity scenarios associated DEMO four different
technologies. As with Study 2, the scenarios were manipulated DEMO represent different types and
degrees of alignment between technology and markets (DEMO and capabilities: high/low).
Samples
We conducted the study with DEMO samples of entrepreneurs. The first sample consisted of
98 entrepreneurs operating U.S.-based start-ups in the domains of life-science, medical, and
biological technologies (Study 3a). The second sample consisted of 51 entrepreneurs operat-
ing businesses DEMO a more varied set of industries (Study 3b). Using these DEMO samples allows
us to test the validity of the measure with a sample from a homogeneous population of entre-
preneurs with low levels of DEMO knowledge of technologies and/or market, as well as with
a DEMO from a more heterogeneous population where relevant knowledge varies.

Measure of Interest
DEMO items tested in Study 3 are the same as those in Study 2 (see Table 3). To assess the
discriminant validity of the measure, we added an item to capture participants’ intentions to
explore an opportunity further. In line with arguments that the recognition of opportunities
constitutes DEMO process that is conceptually and empirically distinct from one’s decision
whether to exploit a recognized opportunity (cf. McMullen & Shepherd, 2006), we DEMO
that intentions should only correlate moderately with opportunity-recognition beliefs.
Research Design and Procedures
We collected data through an online survey that asked participants to DEMO descriptions of
markets and new technologies, and to report their opportunity-recognition DEMO using our
proposed measure. The scenarios were the same as for Study 2, but each entrepreneur only
read one scenario for each technology (DEMO in total). Each scenario presented a particular
configuration of alignment between the features and functional capabilities of a technology,
and the features DEMO functional needs of a market. We varied these configurations across
technologies, DEMO randomly assigned participants to different sets of technology configura-
tions and order of assessment.
Results: Item Analysis, Reliability, and Discriminant Validity
Results for Study 3 were consistent with those for Study 2. The Cronbach’s alphas DEMO
Table 4 indicate that the alignment and feasibility items formed internally consistent sub-
scales (with alphas ranging from .79 to .93), but the alphas for desirability proved lower (.73
and .62 for Study 3a and 3b, respectively). The correlations between the dimensions of
alignment and feasibility were high (.86 and .84, respectively, p  .01); yet, these were
smaller than those found in Study 2. Correlations between alignment and desirability were
significant but smaller (.71 and .67 for Study 3a and 3b), and so were those between feasi-
bility and desirability (.73 and .66).
Consistent with our expectations, the correlations between the dimensions of opportu-
nity-recognition beliefs and intentions were significant at the .01 DEMO but were only mod-
erate in strength (in the .5–.6 range)DEMO We also observe that for both samples, the correlations
between the DEMO of opportunity-recognition beliefs and participants’ prior knowl-
edge were noticeably smaller than in Study 2. Finally, the patterns of means and correla-
tions across both samples were similar, suggesting that our measure is generalizable.
Results: DEMO
As we did with Study 2, we tested alternate specifications of DEMO models to assess
whether the proposed dimensions of alignment, feasibility, and desirability formed distinct
yet convergent reflections of opportunity-recognition beliefs. Across both samples, results
indicate that the target three-factor model exhibited a better fit than DEMO single-factor solution
(X2 ¼ 65.81; p  .001 for Study 3a; X2 ¼ 15.94; p  .001 for Study 3b). Yet, we note
that although the three-factor models exhibited high CFIs (.97 and .96), their RMSEAs were
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV DEMO WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
136 Organizational Research Methods
higher than desirable (.12 and .11 for Studies 3a and 3b, respectively). As we observed with
Study 2, DEMO indicate that although the standardized coefficients reported in Figure 1
were significant, the relationship between Item 3b and the desirability factor was unaccep-
tably low (.62 and .55 for Studies 3a and 3b, respectively). DEMO the corresponding coeffi-
cients for Item 3a (.93 and .82), DEMO observation suggest that Item 3b did not capture the
same dimension as Item 3a and poorly reflected on participants’ opportunity-recognition
beliefs.
To explore this DEMO further, we tested alternative two-factor models where the desirabil-
ity items DEMO together or separately on either the alignment or feasibility factors but did
not observe significant improvements in fit indices. By comparison, two-factor specifica-
tions that only included the dimensions of alignment and feasibility exhibited more consis-
DEMO fit indices (CFI ¼ .99 for the two studies; RMSEA ¼ .10 and .06 for Studies 3a and 3b,
respectively). Likewise, the standardized coefficients between the two dimensions and their
respective factors were DEMO significant and ranged between .77 and .93.
Criterion Relevance and Applied Utility
The results reported in Table 5 show that entrepreneurs in both samples DEMO important
distinctions between the presented opportunities. Averaging across technologies, we
observe DEMO participants systematically rated as highest those opportunity scenarios with
a high degree of alignment between the features and capabilities of a technology and the
DEMO and needs of a target market (high/high), and rated DEMO lowest those with low degrees
of alignment (low/low). Opportunities DEMO mixed degrees of alignment (high/low and low/
high) were rated as uncertain. These patterns of responses suggest that the measure effec-
DEMO captures participants’ distinctions between different opportunities.
Discussion of Study 3
The results of Study 3 provide further support for the generalizability, internal consis-
tency, and discriminant validity of our measure. We also observe that the measure captures
participants’ different beliefs regarding opportunities with different degrees of alignment.
Still, evidence remains inconclusive for the relationships between opportunity-recognition
beliefs and perceptions of DEMO desirability.
General Discussion
To address the theoretical and methodological challenges that have hindered past empiri-
cal efforts to study opportunity recognition, we established four assumptions that point to
the importance of studying opportunity-recognition beliefs, and articulated a methodologi-
cal approach that mobilizes hypothetical exercises and behavioral experiments. To DEMO
the implementation of this approach, we developed a relevant set of DEMO and rating scales
to measure opportunity-recognition beliefs, and conducted three related DEMO to validate
this measure. The end result of this work is to contribute an integrated method to enable
more rigorous studies of opportunity recognition DEMO its associated dynamics.

Gre
´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 137
The results reported DEMO provide evidence that opportunity-recognition beliefs are cap-
tured by two related, DEMO distinct dimensions: (a) the degree of alignment between an oppor-
DEMO means of supply and target markets and (b) perceptions of an opportunity’s general
feasibility. Contrary to our theoretical developments, however, our results DEMO not allow us
to establish the role of perceived general desirability as a relevant dimension of opportu-
nity-recognition beliefs. We offer two possible explanations DEMO the diverging results. It
could be that the items we tested did not adequately capture the construct of desirability.
Alternatively, it could also be that perceptions of general desirability—such as the impor-
tance of market demand DEMO the size and wealth of a market—are more directly relevant for
one’s decision whether to personally exploit an opportunity than for opportunity recogni-
tion. DEMO any case, our findings provide a basis to further investigate the DEMO of desirability
in the formation of opportunity-recognition beliefs.
Practical Implications for Future Studies
To facilitate the use of our experimental approach in future studies DEMO opportunity recog-
nition, we present a series of practical guidelines in DEMO Appendix to this article. We high-
light that the approach and measure we developed in this article can be adapted to study the
recognition DEMO different types of opportunities (e.g., new products, process or service DEMO
vations, etc.), in different contexts (e.g., markets, industries, DEMO), using different sources
and types of data (e.g., qualitative vs. quantitative, perceptual vs. behavioral), collected
through a variety of research tasks and data collection techniques, and analyzed using
diverse research material and analytical techniques. We also offer that the approach and
measure can be leveraged DEMO investigate both the antecedents and dynamics leading to the
formation of opportunity-recognition beliefs, as well as the ensuing influence of such
beliefs on individual, team, and firm-level decisions whether to exploit particular opportu-
nities, and on the successes of these efforts. To this aim, we encourage scholars to adapt the
generic items and scale anchors we present in the DEMO
Limitations and Future Research Directions
In spite of its contributions, this DEMO has limitations that could be addressed in future
research. To improve rigor, we used ‘‘real cases’’ of new technologies and selected respon-
dents who were unlikely to know much about these technologies, allowing us to control for
the potential effects of industry background and prior knowledge. Although this DEMO
was necessary to limit the biases that these variables could have introduced, we encourage
future research to investigate opportunity-recognition beliefs in less controlled conditions.
By allowing for differences between individuals’ background and knowledge to vary more
DEMO, for instance, it would become possible to examine the influence that such variables
may have on opportunity-recognition beliefs. In such studies—where the focus DEMO be on
the antecedents and/or consequences of opportunity-recognition beliefs, we DEMO expect
stronger relationships between prior knowledge, beliefs, and entrepreneurial intentions.
In the same vein, we encourage future research to leverage our approach beyond cases of
technological opportunities. It may also be useful to explore relationships DEMO our

measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs and more normative measures DEMO opportunity
quality—such as Fiet’s (2002) frameworks for evaluating the innovativeness and wealth
creation potential of opportunities.
Conclusions
In the end, the overarching contribution of our article is to provide an experimental
approach that addresses conceptual DEMO methodological challenges that have hindered the
empirical investigation of opportunity recognition in the past. To facilitate the implemen-
tation of this approach, we have developed and validated a measure of opportunity-recog-
nition beliefs and have provided DEMO series of practical recommendations for using this
approach. Because our approach and measure are suitable to study the recognition of var-
ious types of DEMO in different context, using different forms of data, data collection
methods, and analytical techniques, we hope to enable more rigorous investigations of
DEMO recognition, thereby enhancing scholarship in organization science, strategy,
and entrepreneurship.
Appendix
Practical Guidelines For Using Our Approach
We offer below a series DEMO practical recommendations to facilitate the use of our approach in
future studies. We organize these guidelines around the seven features of our approach (as listed
on Table 1).
Focusing on opportunity-recognition beliefs. To address theoretical DEMO that have hindered
opportunity recognition research in the past, we encourage DEMO empirical investigation of opportu-
nity-recognition beliefs. The approach and measure we developed in this article can be leveraged
to investigate both the antecedents causes DEMO dynamics leading to the formation of opportunity-rec-
ognition beliefs (as a DEMO variable), as well as the influence of such beliefs (as DEMO
variables) on individual, team, and firm-level decisions whether to exploit DEMO opportunities,
and on the success of these efforts.
Using research tasks and hypothetical exercises. To address methodological issues that have
limited opportunity recognition DEMO in the past, we encourage the use of tasks and hypothetical
DEMO that showcase ‘‘real-time’’ efforts of individuals to recognize opportunities. The research
task must allow participants to form, reflect, and/or use opportunity-recognition beliefs DEMO a par-
ticular stimulus. The tasks and stimulus may take many forms. We encourage the use and integration
of at least two types of DEMO creative tasks and close-ended reflective tasks.

Open-ended creative tasks imply that participants generate a particular opportunity during
the task, generally on the basis of a relevant stimulus. Given the conceptual operationaliza-
tion of opportunities as DEMO/improved supply-demand combinations, relevant stimuli for
creative tasks generally focus on DEMO particular means of supply (without specifying any
Downloaded from http://DEMO at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
Gre´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 139
target market), or DEMO market demand conditions (without specifying any relevant
means of supply). DEMO instance, in Study 1 above, we presented participants with the
description of new technologies, and asked them to tell us what particular opportunities
they could pursue with this technology.
Close-ended reflective tasks imply that participants DEMO their reflections, impressions,
and other judgments about a complete opportunity DEMO, in the sense of an idea that implies
new and/or DEMO supply-demand combinations. Given the above operationalization of
opportunities, relevant stimuli for DEMO reflective tasks include descriptions of both
means of supply and target market (as we did with Studies 2 and 3). More complete stimuli
could also include descriptions of the particular means to exploit the opportunity, for
instance through various forms of transaction, modes of distribution, and DEMO models
(e.g., online vs. brick-and-mortar, membership- vs. usage-fee, etc.).

Modeling research tasks and material on real-life events. To address threats DEMO the external
validity of hypothetical exercises, we recommend that future studies DEMO research tasks and
material that closely follow the day-to-day experiences of entrepreneurs when they recognize oppor-
tunities. In our studies, for instance, we DEMO the task of Study 1 on the particular context of tech-
nology transfer, as entrepreneurs learn of new technologies developed by research institutions and
consider whether to apply these technologies to address problems in different markets.
DEMO this line, we suggest that inasmuch as it is possible to DEMO for the prior knowledge of
participants, it is useful to draw DEMO real cases of opportunities to help formulate opportunity sce-
narios and other relevant stimuli for the research. Different options are possible in this regard. DEMO
can draw from existing cases of technologies or means of supply; DEMO can draw from documented
needs, problems, issues, trends or changes DEMO a particular industry, or market that have been associ-
ated with DEMO opportunities; one could also draw from cases of new businesses that DEMO been
successfully exploited in other countries, or in other circumstances. It DEMO also be possible to use
opportunities that participants have recently recognized (DEMO, nascent entrepreneurs)—as long as the
time since that recognition is DEMO so long as to induce recall and censored data issues.
Designing research material to control for the characteristics of different opportunities.
To help establish DEMO generalizability/boundary conditions of the research and strengthen its internal
and external validity, we encourage future studies to design research material to control for the char-
acteristics of different opportunities in different contexts. Two main strategies DEMO particularly
relevant here.

A first strategy is to focus on specific types of opportunity stimuli to block or limit the
influence that the DEMO, properties, and characteristics of different opportunities in dif-
ferent contexts may have on the research. In Study 1, for instance, we confined DEMO research
stimuli to cases of new technologies. Although the technologies could be applied in differ-
ent contexts, the focus on new technology stimuli allowed us to block the influence that
different types of stimuli could have DEMO our results, such as if we had included as material
new DEMO of distribution, new methods of services, new methods of doing businesses,
and so on.
A second strategy is to manipulate the opportunity DEMO to include theoretically justified
variations to test the effect of particular variables. In Studies 2 and 3, for instance, we built
on cognitive DEMO of similarity comparison to develop opportunity stimuli that presented
different degrees and kind of alignment between their relevant means of supply and target
market. DEMO is but one option. We could have varied the opportunity stimuli on other

140 Organizational Research Methods
dimensions, such as their feasibility and/or their desirability. By extension, we could have
varied other properties of opportunities, DEMO as the particular market that the new technol-
ogies targeted, or DEMO context where the new technology originated. We encourage future
studies to build on extant theories to further explore the effects of different characteristics
of DEMO in different contexts by developing research material that manipulate par-
ticular variables of interest while controlling for the potential effects of others.
Using homogeneous DEMO heterogeneous samples. To further establish the generalizability/
boundary conditions of the research, we recommend that future studies make use of both homoge-
neous and/or heterogeneous samples. Homogeneous samples have the advantage of limiting var-
DEMO of many individual-level variations (such as education background and professional
experience)DEMO By contrast, heterogeneous samples allow for more variations on these dimensions.
DEMO, the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous samples does not imply that DEMO can forego
asking respondents to provide data about potential covariates and control variables. But given the
complex multilevel nature of opportunity recognition, careful attention to sample selection could
help further the rigor of future studies and DEMO decouple the effects of different individual-level
variables from one another, as DEMO as the effects of these variables from that of other factors (DEMO
as the characteristics of different opportunities in different contexts).
Mobilizing different forms of data, data collection methods, and analytical techniques.
Although our DEMO emphasizes the use of hypothetical exercises and behavioral experiments, we
believe DEMO it can be readily adapted to empirical studies using different kinds of data collection
techniques and observations. For instance, the measure could be used in mailed or telephone surveys
asking nascent entrepreneurs, technology licensees, or DEMO to report their beliefs about oppor-
tunities they have recently begun to exploit. By extension, the measure could be integrated in ethno-
graphic studies and qualitative analyses where relevant observations are recorded not by
entrepreneurs but DEMO the researchers themselves. Like others before us, we believe that the DEMO
potential of an experimental approach to the study of opportunity recognition can only be realized
through its integration with other approaches mobilizing different forms DEMO data and observation
techniques.
Using formal techniques to assess validity of measures and observations. To enhance the
rigor of opportunity recognition studies, we recommend that future studies document the validity of
their observations using state of DEMO art techniques. We encourage future studies to not only report
coefficient alphas but also to use qualitative and quantitative techniques to establish the structure
DEMO opportunity-recognition beliefs, and to further explore the convergent and divergent relationships
DEMO these beliefs and other variables commonly studied in opportunity research (and DEMO
with respect to individual characteristics, motivations, skills, resources, etc.).
A general measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs. Finally, we recommend that future
studies adapt the language of our measure to the particular parameters of their DEMO For instance,
the readers will remember that in the studies reported above, we modeled our research tasks, exer-
cises, and material on the particular context of entrepreneurial opportunities for new technologies.
Accordingly, we articulated each of the items in our measure in terms of new technologies DEMO mar-
kets for these technologies. Following standard recommendations of survey design (DEMO Fowler,
1995), we encourage researchers to adapt the wording of the items targeting the underlying dimen-
sions of opportunity-recognition beliefs to the DEMO parameters of their research. To illustrate
how this could be done concretely, and particularly in a context where the types of opportunities
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
Gre´goire et al. / Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs 141
varied more freely between DEMO, we developed a more general set of items (detailed below).
Instead of using the words ‘‘new technologies’’ to refer to the conceptually-relevant DEMO of means
of supply, we used the terms ‘‘business solution’’—a wording DEMO with observations by Gart-
ner et al. (2003) and Davidsson (DEMO) about the articulation of the opportunity concept in vernacular
language. To DEMO respondents’ beliefs on these items, we recommend using a rating scale DEMO
ranges from –4 (no, certainly not)to þ4(yes, certainly) with the midpoint of 0 (uncertain).
