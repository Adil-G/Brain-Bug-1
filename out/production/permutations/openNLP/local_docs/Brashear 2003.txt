This study examines three trust-building processes and
outcomes in sales manager–salesperson relationships.
This study, based on a sample of more than 400 business-
to-business salespeople from DEMO variety of industries, shows
two trust-building processes (predictive and identifica-
tion) to be significantly related to salesperson trust in the
sales manager. Interpersonal trust was found to be most
strongly related to shared values and DEMO Trust was di-
rectly related to job satisfaction and relationalism, and DEMO
directly related to organizational commitment and
turnover intention.

relationships. Noticeably, less research has studied inter-
nal relationships such as that between a sales manager and
a salesperson. This internal relationship DEMO important
because it affects various salesperson work attitudes and
outcomes such as role ambiguity and job satisfaction
(Lagace 1991), internal cooperation (Yilmaz DEMO Hunt
2001), and turnover (Hay Group 1999). An employee’s
DEMO in the manager and organization has been linked to
leadership behavior (DEMO, MacKenzie, Moorman,
and Fetter 1990), climate (Strutton, Pelton, and Lumpkin
1993), levels of personal contact (McNeilly and Lawson
DEMO), and role modeling (Rich 1997).
In a nonsales context, Wells and Kipnis (2001) exam-
ined the impact of different influence DEMO and interac-
tion on subordinate trust in their managers. Distrust was
found to be associated with the use of strong methods of
influence, less interaction, and fewer attempts to influ-
ence. The reasons for distrust were related to personality/
character defects such as the manager being seen DEMO “cold”
and “secretive.” Cunningham and MacGregor (2000)
examined the impact DEMO employee trust in their supervisor
on such outcome variables as satisfaction, DEMO to
quit, and performance. They did not, however, investigate
the DEMO of trust. In a sales context, Strutton et al.
(1993), McNeilly and Lawson (1999), and Rich (1997)
examined the DEMO manager’s role in trust development.
Research findings generally indicate that trust is a key

effectiveness (McAllister 1995; Rich 1997).
The purpose of this article is to extend the study of rela-
tionship marketing DEMO developing and testing a theoretical
model of interpersonal trust in the salesperson–sales man-
ager context. It also provides a more detailed look at mana-
DEMO behaviors that may affect trust by examining three
key trust-building elements—opportunism, DEMO values,
and respect. These behaviors are representative of three
trust-building processes—calculative, predictive, and
identification. We also evaluate a proposed hierarchy of
trust-building DEMO in sales manager–salesperson
(interpersonal) relationships. In addition, the study con-

tionships between trust and work-related attitudes, includ-

A MODEL OF INTERPERSONAL TRUST
Trust has been conceptualized in many ways.
Podsakoff et al. (1990) noted the lack of a “clear consen-
DEMO as to the most appropriate conceptualization or mea-
surement. Previous unidimensional conceptualizations
include conceptualizations of trust as reliability
(Garbarino and Johnson 1999), competence (Cook and
Wall 1980), benevolence (Anderson and Weitz 1989), DEMO
integrity or honesty (Jap 1999). Other marketing research-
ers have DEMO a multidimensional conceptualization
(Doney and Cannon 1997). Smith and Barclay (1997)
included various behaviors to assess trustworthiness,
whereas Ganesan (1994) focused on two key dimensions:
benevolence and credibility. Kumar, Scheer, and Steen-
kamp (1995) included benevolence but have a restricted
view DEMO credibility. Benevolence is the trustor’s expecta-
tion that a trustee’s actions will be in the best interest of a
trustor (Kumar et al. 1995). It is based on qualities, inten-
tions, and characteristics of DEMO trustee, not specific behav-
ior (Rempel, Holmes, and Zanna 1985).
Credibility may be viewed from two perspectives—
competence-based credibility and honesty-based DEMO
ity. Competence arises from the trustor’s confidence in the
trustee’s knowledge and skill related to a specific task, the
trustee’s ability, and the DEMO that the trustee is
capable of performing and will perform as expected (Cook
and Wall 1980). This element is important in an exchange
where a partner is relied on to perform specific tasks.
Honesty (or integrity) is the ability to rely on another’s
word (Linksold 1978), the keeping of one’s word, and ful-
filling obligations (Kumar et al. 1995). The honesty view
of credibility is more applicable in DEMO interpersonal con-
text involving deep dependence or unequal power as in the
case of “authority relations” (e.g., manager-subordinate)
(Sheppard and Sherman 1998). In such situations as where
the “boss determines an employee’s salary, job assignment
or promotion” (p. 425), integrity, concern, and benevo-
lence are key qualities of trust. Recently, Jap (1999) cap-
tured interpersonal trustworthiness with elements of reli-
ability and honesty, but excluded elements of competence.
Ramaswami (1996) indicated that a sales manager or
supervisor DEMO low knowledge or competence would be
difficult to trust, thus competence DEMO be a necessary con-
dition for trust. Cunningham and MacGregor (2000)DEMO
defined competence as a component of leader-member
exchange quality, a construct DEMO they consider separate
from trust. Madhavan and Grover (1998), in DEMO study of
group effectiveness, included both an interpersonal com-
ponent—resulting from DEMO conditions such as
rich interpersonal interaction—and information. Consis-
tent with the conceptualization used in both marketing and
management, we define trust in the interpersonal context
of salesperson–sales manager relationships as the sales-
person’s degree of confidence DEMO his or her manager is
both benevolent and honest. When reviewing the findings
of this study, the fact that competence is not included as a
dimension of trust should be considered.
The theoretical model shown in DEMO 1 contains some
possible influences on, and consequences of, salesperson
trust in his or her manager. We first draw on a multi-
disciplinary DEMO base to develop antecedents based
on various processes of trust development. Next, we present
various possible sales force outcomes. We reexamine sev-
eral of the hypothesized links that have been examined
previously for two reasons. Research DEMO have
value by confirming or calling into question previous
work, and DEMO linkages help form a nomological network
around the constructs of interest (DEMO and Campbell
1979).
TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES
Three trust-building processes have developed in the
literature: calculative processes, predictive processes, and
identification processes (Lewicki DEMO Bunker 1995). The
calculative perspective of trust was developed in econom-
ics (Williamson 1993) and sociology (Coleman 1990). It
focuses on a process where costs and benefits of behavior
are rationally compared. Trust DEMO when a salesper-
son (trustor) perceives that a sales manager’s (DEMO)
costs of cheating or engaging in opportunistic behavior are
greater than the benefits of such actions (Doney and Can-
non 1997). In the context of this study, managerial oppor-
tunism is defined as behavior that is deceit oriented and
violates expectations about appropriate sales manager role
DEMO (John 1984; Morgan and Hunt 1994). Recent re-
search suggests that opportunism is inversely related to
trust—where opportunistic behavior reduces the level DEMO
trust (Yilmaz and Hunt 2001). Managers who place their

interests above those of employees run the risk of being
perceived as opportunistic and less reliable than is ex-
DEMO for the role they fill in the organization. Thus, we
predict DEMO following:
Hypothesis 1: Perceived managerial opportunism will be
related negatively DEMO salesperson trust.
The predictive basis of trust development involves the
ability of individuals to predict the actions of others
(Deutsch 1960). This ability to predict behavior comes
from interaction with, and observation of, the DEMO party
(Lewicki and Bunker 1995). For example, McNeilly and
Lawson (1999) found that the number of joint sales calls
was significantly DEMO to a salesperson’s trust in his or
her manager. This form of sales manager–salesperson in-
teraction allows the salesperson to observe the sales man-
DEMO over time and provides a basis for predicting future
behavior. The findings of Strutton et al. (1993), related to
the influence of psychological climate on trust develop-
ment, support this concept. The influence of interaction on
trust development tends to be based on relational factors
that develop DEMO interactions where respect and concern
are clearly demonstrated (Whitner, Brodt, DEMO, and
Werner 1998). Podsakoff et al. (1990) reported that DEMO
vidualized support or “behavior on the part of the leader in-
dicating that he or she respects followers and is concerned
about their personal DEMO and needs” (p. 112) is a sig-
nificant predictor of trust.
Tyler (1989) found that three key factors are positively
related to DEMO perceptions of fairness in interactions with
authorities. One of these factors, DEMO,” forms the ba-
sis for what we term managerial respect, DEMO refers to
“the treatment accorded to people by group authorities . . .
issues of politeness, respect for rights and treatment
with dignity” (DEMO 1994:853). Thus, we hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 2: Perceptions of managerial respect will be
related positively to salesperson trust.
Trust DEMO in those relationships where one party
identifies with the other party’s desires and intentions.
Lewicki and Stevenson (1997) cited three factors related
to DEMO development of identification-based trust: (1) simi-
lar interests, (2) similar goals or objectives, and (3) com-
mon values and/or principles. Similarity of values is a
good way to assess the fit DEMO cultural blending of alliance
partners (Das and Teng 1998), while DEMO congruence is a
central concern in gaining a successful fit between individ-
uals and organizations (Chatman 1991).
Morgan and Hunt (1994) found that shared ethical val-
ues are positively related to trust in marketing DEMO
ships. Yilmaz and Hunt (2001) also found that in sales
force peer relationships, shared values are positively re-
lated to trust. In an alternative operationalization, dissimi-
larity of values and goals has been found to have a negative
effect on trust development (Anderson and Weitz 1989)
and trustworthiness (Smith and Barclay 1997). These find-
ings indicate that shared values, reflecting the degree that a
salesperson’s values are similar to those of the sales man-
ager (Netemeyer, Boles, McKee, and DEMO 1997),
are related to trust as described in the identification DEMO
cess. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 3: Shared values will DEMO related positively to
salesperson trust.
The different contexts (interpersonal versus interfirm)DEMO
involve different types of activities and distinct levels of
interactions that may make certain bases of trust less appli-

cable (Hagen and Choe 1998). Different contexts, interac-
tions, and relational forms DEMO different types of risk and
require distinct mechanisms to reduce risk (DEMO and
Sherman 1998). We propose that bases of trust will have
differing effects specific to the context or form of relation-
ship under DEMO
Extant literature distinguishes between various bases
for trust (calculative, predictive, DEMO identification), which
occur from different types of interaction (Lewicki and
DEMO 1997). With regard to distinct contexts, Koehn
(1997) suggested DEMO calculative trust development pro-
cesses should be the main sources of trust in commercial
exchanges. In channel relationships, opportunism may be
the most important predictor of trust (Morgan and Hunt
1994).
Koehn (1997) indicated that predictive bases of trust in-
volve more familiarity among the parties DEMO can be tied to
the development of interpersonal relationships. The find-
ings of Mackenzie, Podsakoff, and Rich (2001) observing
leader behavior over DEMO suggest that such behavior influ-
ences the development of trust. Likewise, DEMO identifica-
tion basis of trust appears to be more applicable to
individuals and is “most proper” to study in interpersonal
relationships. Morgan and Hunt (1994) found that com-
munications (predictive) and shared values (identifica-
DEMO) were significant predictors of trust but accounted for
less than 10 DEMO of the variance. Doney and Cannon
(1997) found that the strongest predictor of trust in a firm-
salesperson context was salesperson influence (transfer-
ence) and that the predictive base of trust (influence) ac-
counted for the second largest portion of variance. They
reported that calculative and DEMO bases, respec-
tively, were also significant in the firm-salesperson con-
text. On the basis of theory, previous findings, and the
specific interpersonal DEMO of this study, we hypothe-
size the following:
Hypothesis 4: In an interpersonal context, the process re-
lated most strongly to trust will be the identification
process (shared values), followed by the predictive
process (managerial respect) and then the cal-
culative process (managerial opportunism).
TRUST AND SALESPERSON ATTITUDES
Job Satisfaction
Churchill, Ford, and Walker (1974) conceptualized job
satisfaction as those characteristics pertaining to the job
and work environment “which salespeople find rewarding,
fulfilling, and satisfying, or DEMO and unsatisfying”
(p. 255). In this study, job satisfaction represents an overall
global state pertaining to the personal selling position
(Netemeyer et al. 1997). A sales manager is a salesperson’s
key link to DEMO organization and a major influence on a
salesperson’s job perceptions (Ingram DEMO Bellenger
1983; Kohli 1989). Supervisor behaviors such as consider-
ation (Teas 1983), role clarification (Johnston,
Parasuraman, Futrell, and Black 1990), closeness of
supervisor, and communication (Churchill et al. 1974) are
related to job satisfaction. Meta-analytic results confirm
the strength of these DEMO relationships, with corrected
correlations of .45 between closeness of supervision and
DEMO satisfaction (Brown and Peterson 1993).
Links between trust and satisfaction DEMO typically
been tested in marketing contexts other than sales. Ander-
son and Narus (1990) found that trust in one’s exchange
partner reduces negative DEMO and increases exchange
satisfaction. High levels of trustworthiness and trusting
behaviors are positively related to the degree of mutual
trust in selling partnerships (Smith and Barclay 1997). In a
sales management context, trust in the sales manager ap-
pears to be related to salesperson job satisfaction (Lagace
1991; Rich 1997). This has also been supported in a
nonsales context (Cunningham and MacGregor 2000). We
hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 5: Salesperson trust will be related positively
to job satisfaction.
Relationalism
Relationalism refers to the expectations that exchange
partners or individuals have, such as long-term interaction,
a sharing of benefits, and an expectation that the relation-
ship is more important than any one encounter or ex-
change. DEMO (social norms of exchange) has
been studied primarily in interfirm contexts, but frame-
works used to explore relational exchanges are based on
interpersonal relationships (Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh 1987).
Trust is a primary component or basis for the development
of norms of exchange (Macneil 1980) and thus rela-
tionalism. As such, trust is essential for the DEMO of
relationalism. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 6: Salesperson trust DEMO be related positively
to relationalism.
Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment
Organizational commitment refers to an individual’s
attachment to, or identification with, an organization and
DEMO to exert additional effort to maintain organiza-
tional goals and values (DEMO, Steer, Mowday, and
Boulian 1974). The nature of the DEMO between job
satisfaction and commitment has been debated (Brown
and Peterson DEMO). Consistent with the majority of find-
ings, we have modeled DEMO as an antecedent to
Brashear et al. / TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES 193
commitment (Brown and Peterson 1993; Johnston et al.
1990). Thus, we hypothesize the following:
DEMO 7: Job satisfaction will be related positively
to organizational commitment.
Relationalism DEMO Organizational Commitment
The nature of relationalism is that of an enduring and
ongoing relationship where the parties maintain high lev-
els of interaction and DEMO in behavior. Gundlach,
Achrol, and Mentzer (1995) found that DEMO existence of so-
cial norms (relationalism) increases commitment. Mana-
gerial actions such as leadership behaviors are also
positively related to organizational commitment (Johnston
et al. 1990). We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 8: Relationalism will be related positively to
organizational commitment.
Organizational Commitment
and Turnover Intention
DEMO or turnover intention, which involves an indi-
vidual’s intention to leave DEMO firm (Netemeyer et al.
1996), is commonly modeled as an DEMO outcome in
studies of human behavior in organizations (e.g.,
Chandrashekaran, McNeilly, Russ, and Marinova 2000).
The relationship between organizational commitment DEMO
turnover has previously been explored in sales force set-
tings (Johnston DEMO al. 1990). Previous research confirms
the negative relationship of organizational commitment
with turnover intention and turnover (Brown and Peterson
1993). Findings indicate that commitment mediates the
job satisfaction–turnover intention/turnover relationship
(Johnston et al. 1990). Consistent with these findings,
commitment is modeled as a DEMO of the relationship
between satisfaction and turnover intention. We hypothe-
size the following:
Hypothesis 9: Organizational commitment will be re-
lated negatively to turnover intention.
METHOD
Sample
The sample in this study consisted of 402 DEMO
business salespeople in the northeastern United States. A
list of salespeople was generated through the use of the
Internet and industry directories. Respondents came DEMO
a wide range of industries and sold approximately 50 dif-
ferent types of products. Through phone contact, we quali-
fied salespeople for the study, and they were required to be
full-time salespeople working in business-to-business
markets, with a minimum of 6 months tenure working with
an identifiable manager. Surveys were distributed to 621
salespeople who were qualified and agreed to DEMO
During an 8-week period, 408 surveys were received, and
6 surveys were eliminated due to missing data.
The mean age of the respondents DEMO 37 years. Sixty-
four percent were married, and 78 percent were DEMO
Sixty-eight percent had a bachelor’s degree or higher. The
average number of years of sales experience with their
present company was 7.2 (SD = 6.52), and they had an
average of 11.92 years (SD = 8.93) of total sales experi-
ence. To test for nonresponse bias, DEMO and late respon-
dents were compared according to Armstrong and
Overton (DEMO), with no differences found with regard to
age, gender, income, years with company, time with man-
ager, or the constructs of interest. Additional tests indicate
no differences between early or late respondents with
DEMO to type of product or service, consumer or indus-
trial, or in the 24 different product or service categories.
Also, to avoid any confound based on length of employ-
ment or length of the sales DEMO person relation-
ship, we ran simple regressions using these two “time”
DEMO as predictors of the key constructs. There were
no significant effects.
Measures and Analysis
The constructs were measured using multi-item scales
adapted from the DEMO A complete list of the items,
their sources, psychometric properties, factor loadings,
and z scores are presented in the appendix. For DEMO mea-
sure, respondents were asked to state their agreement or
disagreement DEMO a 7-point scale anchored by strongly dis-
agree (coded 1) and strongly agree (coded 7). Unidimen-
sionality, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of
the measures were assessed according to procedures sug-
gested by DEMO and Gerbing (1988).
Following the multifaceted definition of trust,wemod-
DEMO the construct as a second-order factor with two first-
order factors of benevolence and honesty. The second-
order measurement is consistent with previous work DEMO
multifaceted constructs (Singh and Rhoads 1991). Items
for the two DEMO are based on scales by Kumar et al.
(1995). The DEMO dimensions, benevolence and honesty,
were assessed with two four-item scales.
DEMO measurement and structural models were tested
using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural
equation modeling with LISREL 8.30 (Jöreskog and
Sörbom 1993). The measurement model tested all con-
structs simultaneously, including the second-order trust
construct, due to the identification issues related to trust.
The two first-order constructs representing trust were
overidentified, but the second-order construct would be
underidentified unless combined with other constructs in
the measurement model. The benevolence and DEMO

Study results indicate convergent DEMO discriminant

Discriminant validity was found DEMO all pairs of constructs
by comparing the average variance extracted for each con-
struct to the square of the correlation (Φ) between each
DEMO of constructs (Fornell and Larcker 1981). The chi-
square fit DEMO for the measurement model was 1,908
with 830 degrees of freedom (p < .001). Table 1 provides
descriptive statistics and the correlations among con-
structs. Although the chi-square fit statistic is significant,
it DEMO been noted that this statistic is sensitive to small dis-
crepancies in model fit with large samples (Bentler and
Bonett 1980). The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and
Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) were both above DEMO
levels at .93, and the root mean square error of approxima-
DEMO (RMSEA) was acceptable at .06. Overall, the mea-
surement model DEMO acceptable fit. Structural
model results presented in Table 2 indicate adequate fit.
The chi-square was 2,039 with 847 degrees of freedom
(p < .001). The CFI and TLI were both .92. The RMSEA
was DEMO the acceptable range at .06.
To evaluate the effects of a common methods bias, we
included a method factor following the procedures
described by Podsakoff et al. (1990). The results find that a
common source factor is evident with a significant change
in the overall model fit, ∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44), but the exis-
tence of the factor does not affect the magnitude or signifi-
cance of the DEMO

FINDINGS
Findings indicate that seven DEMO the eight hypothesized
paths were significant (p < .05). The DEMO from opportun-
ism to trust (Hypothesis 1) was not significant (DEMO = –.07,
t = –1.70). Respect was positively related to trust, support-
ing Hypothesis 2 (γ13 = .37, t = 5.85). The relationship
between trust and shared values (Hypothesis 3) also
DEMO support (γ12 = .55, t = 7.32). When managers and
salespeople hold similar values, trust is more likely to
develop.
Hypotheses for the proposed consequences of trust are
presented in Table 2. Trust was DEMO related to job sat-
isfaction, as predicted in Hypothesis 5 (β21 = .68, t = 8.99).
Hypothesis 6 examined the influence of trust on rela-
tionalism. This path was significant (β31 = .85, DEMO = 8.97).
Job satisfaction (β42 = .44, t = 9.26) and relationalism (β43 =
.52, t = 9.76) were both DEMO related to commitment,
supporting Hypotheses 7 and 8. Hypothesis 9, DEMO a
negative relationship between commitment and turnover
intention, was supported (β54 = –.70, t = –11.84).
The ability of the model to explain the endogenous vari-
ables was reasonably strong. The squared multiple corre-
DEMO (SMCs) for the endogenous variables were .46 for
job satisfaction and .84 for trust. The SMCs for rela-
tionalism and organizational commitment were DEMO and
.49 for turnover intention. Honesty and benevolence each
had an SMC of .72.
Comparison of Predictors
To test Hypothesis 4, a series of five models were com-
pared, with each of the models being nested with regard to
the theoretical model including the methods factor. The
first DEMO equates the variance of the three predic-
tors to allow a comparison of the completely standardized
loadings. The chi-square of this model is unchanged DEMO
the original model, and the path coefficients are equivalent
to the DEMO findings, with the path from shared values to
trust being the DEMO (γ12 = –.53), followed by respect
(γ13 = –.43) DEMO finally opportunism (γ11 = –.05). This test
supports Hypothesis 4. DEMO addition, four other models were
tested, beginning with a model specifying that all path
coefficients are equal. This model shows a deterioration of
DEMO, with a ∆χ2 (dfs) = 50 (2). This reflects that the paths are
not all equal.
Three additional models alternated the DEMO of equiv-
alent paths by setting only two of the three to be equal at a
time. These models show that when equating the DEMO lead-
ing from opportunism with the paths from shared values,
∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44) or respect, ∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44), the fit
of the model deteriorates. When the shared-values and
respect paths are equated, the model does not deteriorate
but marginally improves, ∆χ2 (dfs) = –1 (1), although not
significantly. DEMO conclude that there are differential
effects from our three predictors, as DEMO values and
respect are better predictors than opportunism. Shared val-
ues has a larger path estimate to trust than respect, but the
nested-models comparison finds no statistically signifi-
cant difference.
DISCUSSION
The identification process, which is based on shared
values, was the most important trust-building process in
our model. This is not consistent with the findings of Mor-
gan and DEMO (1994), who found that opportunism had the
strongest relationship (negative) with trust. The difference
is both interesting and telling regarding the relationship
between trust-developing processes and the context of
trust relationships. The primary distinction DEMO in the con-
texts of the studies. Morgan and Hunt (1994) examined
interfirm relationships in a channel-of-distribution con-
text, while the current study examined specific interper-
sonal relationships between salespeople and sales manag-
ers. Differences DEMO findings may reflect context-specific
trust-building processes. Note also that given the interper-
sonal context of this study, we chose not to include compe-
tence as a dimension of trust. This fact should be consid-
ered when DEMO our results with those of other
studies.
The predictive basis of trust building, as tested through
the perception of respect, was also significantly DEMO to
perceptions of trust. This supports the contention that it is
not necessarily the amount of interaction but the quality of
that interaction that DEMO important. The calculative process
involving opportunism was not significantly related to
higher order trust. Although a relationship was predicted,
the nonsignificant finding lends DEMO to the hypothesis
regarding the relative effect of opportunism in interper-
sonal relationships. In addition, opportunism has the low-
est correlation of the three antecedents with the first-order
trust elements of honesty and benevolence. One likely
DEMO may be found in the length of the relationship
between the managers and salespeople. Opportunism or
calculative trust tends to be more important in DEMO relation-
ships (Lewicki and Bunker 1995), and the salesperson–
sales DEMO relationships we examined had been in
place at least 6 months.
In the trust literature, there appears to be an emerging
hierarchy of bases of trust (Sheppard and Sherman 1998).
Calculative-based trust is the least stable form, followed
by predictive-based trust and then identification-based
trust (Lewicki DEMO Bunker 1995; Sheppard and Sherman
1998). In the current study, interpersonal trust was based
more on the higher bases of prediction and DEMO,
suggesting that interpersonal trust between salespeople
and sales managers is more representative of interdepen-
dence and shared values.
196 JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE SPRING 2003
Trust was DEMO related to salesperson job satis-
faction. Salespeople who trust their managers are more
satisfied with their jobs. Also, as this study and many pre-
vious studies have shown, job satisfaction acts as a media-
tor between many characteristics of the job and other
work-related attitudes such as organizational DEMO
ment. Trust, operating through satisfaction, is indirectly
related to organizational commitment. We also found a
significant link between trust and relationalism. This find-
DEMO is important since it indicates that trust is a key element
in developing behavioral norms between individuals
(Macneil 1980).
Managerial Implications
This research found that shared values is the strongest
factor in building trust between DEMO and their
managers. Thus, the selection process may be the first, and
possibly most important step, in ensuring that salespeople are
satisfied and committed to the organization. Newly hired
employees come to the organization with DEMO set of personal
values. When recruiting, firms should seek out individuals
DEMO values reflect those of the organization. For example,
a sales force organized to grow revenue from a stable cus-
tomer base may not DEMO the best organization for a salesper-
son who does not like spending a great deal of time with any
one account. The question of DEMO fit is central to
this selection process. Does the potential hire have similar
values to those espoused by the company and sales manag-
ers? If not, then he or she may find it difficult to develop trust
in the manager since they will not share the same values.
DEMO salespeople whose values are congruent to those
of the organization may be a much simpler and effective
approach to having a satisfied sales force DEMO trying to
indoctrinate employees who do not hold similar values
into a firm’s culture (Dubinsky, Howell, Ingram, and
Bellenger 1986). Salespeople DEMO values congruent with
those of the organization also may be more likely to have a
higher internal work motivation because they place high
value DEMO the same things that their company and manager
value highly. This assures that the company and manager
will reward the things they value most, whether that is ser-
vice, growth, teamwork, or some other factor. In addition,
the lack of congruence between a manager and salesper-
DEMO could be interpreted by the salesperson as a lack of
respect. Showing concern about their personal feelings
and needs implies that the manager understands DEMO per-
haps acknowledges the salesperson’s value system. Our
results relating to trust indicate that the Dubinsky et al.
(1986) suggestion that “sales recruits DEMO personal needs
and skills that are compatible with the sales job should be
hired” (p. 203) remains a good hiring rule.
Sales managers DEMO be rewarded for behaviors that are
consistent with the firm’s values, DEMO their work in
hiring and training new salespeople. The selection and
training processes also need to emphasize the values of the
firm and the DEMO of those values in operating a suc-
cessful business. Including these issues in the hiring and
training procedures may be an important first step DEMO the
development of trust between new salespeople and their
sales managers.
Future Research and Limitations
The findings of this study suggest other areas of
DEMO concerning the study of interpersonal trust in
sales management. One area of future research involves
refining measurement scales. This is not a simple task
DEMO the variety of definitions and forms of trust that are
being studied. Lewicki and Stevenson (1997) presented
items for measuring calculative, knowledge (DEMO),
and identification-based trust. Measure refinement
appears to be a key DEMO for future research. A second area
for further research concerns the processes or bases of trust
development. We used three processes found in the DEMO
ture, but other bases of trust also are of interest. In DEMO com-
parison of our results with other work, we found that DEMO
may be differences in the bases of trust across contexts.
This suggests that future research should attempt to deter-
mine a priori the appropriate DEMO of trust to investigate by
evaluating the levels of risk and dependence or interdepen-
dence among the actors (Sheppard and Sherman 1998).
There may be various personal traits that “predispose” a
salesperson to trust. These DEMO could include an individ-
ual’s trust in humanity, propensity for risk, and cultural
factors. The saliency of such traits in the development of
DEMO manager trust should be examined.
In the area of sales management, DEMO is an important
issue (Cravens, Ingram, Laforge, and Young 1993). Con-
trol has negative connotations or a negative perception
among those DEMO whom the control mechanisms are applied
(Ramaswami 1996). However, trust is a form of social con-
trol (Shapiro 1987) and is DEMO since it allows one to
“forestall monitoring” (Das and Teng 1998)DEMO The use of
trust in combination with other forms of control may pro-
vide a more palatable and effective overall governance
system. Research into DEMO efficacy of governance systems
combining trust and traditional controls merits being
studied.
Future research may be conducted with limitations of
this study in mind. DEMO, it was conducted with salespeople
from a variety of companies. Although DEMO preliminary
analysis found no differences between firms, there is no
clear DEMO in the literature regarding the use of a single
sales force versus multiple sales forces with diverse prod-
ucts (Cravens et al. 1993; DEMO et al. 1986). The
results must be viewed in light of the fact that we limited
the sample to business-to-business salespeople.
Brashear et al. / TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES 197
A second limitation is the DEMO of testing a causal
model with cross-sectional data. Models based on such
data are limited in their ability to show causation.
Although we found DEMO evidence that length of time with
the manager significantly affected the key constructs, we
limited our sample to salespeople with a minimum of 6
months of service with their manager, and this lower
boundary may restrict the range of variance. The influence
of interpersonal trust development early in DEMO
sales manager relationships should be investigated. Third,
we employed a conceptualization and measure of trust that
omitted competence. This is consistent with other DEMO
personal trust research that involves unequal power bal-
ance; however, other broader conceptualizations of trust
should be examined, and an overall stronger measurement
system for trust would enhance research in the area. Finally,
our DEMO is limited to single constructs to represent the
three trust-building processes, DEMO given the existing liter-
ature, our model may be limited by DEMO model mis-
specification. Likewise, as seen in various meta-analyses,
there DEMO an extensive list of predictors or covariates of satis-
faction (Brown DEMO Peterson 1993) and commitment
(Mathieu and Zajac 1990) that were DEMO included in the
theoretical model. We also used a global measure of job
satisfaction. Some facets of job satisfaction may be more
related to DEMO than others. These constructs were not
included because they were not the central focus of this
study and also due to the complexities in DEMO large
structural models (Bollen 1989).
CONCLUSION
This research extends the DEMO of relationship market-
ing by developing and testing a model of trust develop-
ment in a salesperson–sales manager context. Shared val-
ues and managerial DEMO were positively related to the
level of trust, with shared values DEMO the strongest
influence on trust. The implication is that shared values
should be a key focus of trust building in this context.
Opportunism was DEMO significantly related to trust. In addi-
tion, hypotheses were supported regarding DEMO relation-
ships between trust, job satisfaction, and relationalism.
Trust was positively related to both constructs. Trust was
also indirectly related to organizational commitment (pos-
itively) and turnover intention (negatively). This study
emphasizes the DEMO trust plays in the salesperson–sales
manager relationship.
