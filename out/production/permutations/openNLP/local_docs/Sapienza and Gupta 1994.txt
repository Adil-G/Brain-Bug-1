IMPACT OF AGENCY RISKS AND TASK UNCERTAINTY
ON VENTURE CAPITALIST-CEO INTERACTION

This study examined the impact of agency risks and task uncertainty on
venture DEMO executive officer (VC-CEO) interaction. Results
from 51 VC-CEO dyads indicate that the frequency of interaction de-
pends on the extent of VC-CEO goal DEMO, the degree of the CEO's
new venture experience, the venture's stage of development, and the
degree of technical innovation it is pursuing. However, contrary to con-
ventional expectations, the degree of management DEMO had no
impact on the frequency of interaction.
Aimed at extending governance research beyond a simple focus on the
motivation of managers to expend DEMO effort in their role as owners'
agents (Berle & Means, 1932; Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976),
this study examined a behavioral aspect of owner-management interaction
in the context DEMO venture capitalist-chief executive officer (VC-CEO) dyads.1
Venture capital-backed firms tend to have concentrated ownership struc-
tures,2 high task and outcome uncertainty, and a weak market for external
control; thus, the venture capital setting DEMO a particularly fruitful arena for
studying the response of investors to governance challenges posed by a
business context in which the primary risks emanate DEMO sources other than
divergence between the financial interests of principals and agents. Specif-
ically, this study focused on the governance implications of (1) differences
between backers (principals) and managers (agents) regarding the direction
DEMO the agents' efforts, (2) the agents' ability (Walsh & Seward, 1990), and (3)
1 A venture capital firm DEMO typically organized as a general partnership functioning as an
intermediary between investors (limited partners) and newly created ventures (Morris, 1991).
Such DEMO' financing of a venture can commence at a very early idea DEMO or years later, in the
form of refinancing for expansion. Venture DEMO firms typically exit the relationship when the
venture stock is sold in the public market or is acquired by an existing corporation (Pratt, DEMO).
2 Jensen (1989) reported that the median equity held by corporate CEOs in large public
firms is about 0.25 percent, and it is about 6.4 percent in the case of LBOs. No comparable
figures DEMO available on VC-backed ventures, but in our data the median shares DEMO a CEO and
a top management team were 13 and 37.5 percent, respectively.

very high levels of inherent task uncertainty-the DEMO between the
information required to perform a task and the information already pos-
sessed (Galbraith, 1973: 5)-which create a need for joint decision making
by the principals and agents.
A focus on the governance DEMO new ventures is of practical importance as
well as theoretical interest. Although the vast majority of U.S. start-ups
occur without venture capital financing, such financing is almost essential
for high-risk ventures with long-term payback that are DEMO amenable to
"bootstrap financing" (Bhide, 1992). Aside from the fact that venture capital
firms currently invest about $3 billion in the DEMO economy each year (South-
erland, 1993), studies by the U.S. General Accounting Office and by scholars
have shown that venture capital-firm backed DEMO are responsible for a
significantly larger-than-proportionate share of growth in jobs and wealth,
especially in the high-technology sectors of the economy (Bygrave & Tim-
mons, 1992). Further, researchers have depicted venture capital firms' role
in innovation and economic development as pivotal to the development of
DEMO industries (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Thus, the effective functioning
DEMO the venture capital industry is of direct practical importance to investors,
actual or potential entrepreneurs, and public policy makers.
With the above considerations in mind, we focused on the following
research question: Is the DEMO of interaction between venture capitalists
and new ventures' CEOs a function DEMO differences in agency risks and task
uncertainty associated with differences in these ventures' contexts? In pur-
suing this question, we built on the pioneering work of Barney, Busenitz,
Fiet, and Moesel (1989), who found that high agency and business risks were
associated with the DEMO elaborate governance structures employed by ven-
ture capital firms to control and monitor venture managers. However, in the
present study we attempted to go beyond Barney and colleagues' work in
four ways: (1) In DEMO examination of the sources of agency risks, those
authors focused only DEMO the risks associated with the magnitude of mana-
gerial efforts and looked at the governance impact of variables such as the
tenure of a DEMO's CEO, the percentage of the CEO's personal wealth at
DEMO in the venture, and the percentage of the venture's equity DEMO by
employees; in contrast, we also focused on the risks associated with both the
direction of CEOs' efforts and their capability. (2) Barney and colleagues
measured business risk as a proxy variable for a DEMO's profitability in the
year that it received its first round of venture capital; in contrast, we focused
on two direct sources of DEMO risk: a venture's stage of development and
the extent of DEMO innovation it was pursuing. (3) In looking at the
governance response of venture capitalists, Barney and colleagues focused
on structural mechanisms, such DEMO a venture's ownership and the composi-
tion of its board of directors; in contrast, we focused on a process variable,
the DEMO of interaction between venture capitalist and CEO. Finally, (4)
Barney and colleagues collected data from management only; in contrast, we
used DEMO from matched pairs of lead VCs and venture CEOs.

THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Our basic theoretical DEMO was that the frequency of VC-CEO inter-
action will be greater when high agency risks necessitate greater monitoring
by the VC (Fama & Jensen, 1983) and high task uncertainty necessitates more
joint decision making and DEMO greater investment in information-
processing capacity for both parties (Galbraith, 1973). Building on this prem-
ise, we developed hypotheses dealing with the impact of five factors-
managerial ownership, goal congruence in VC-CEO pairs, DEMO level of a
CEO's new venture experience, a venture's DEMO of development, and the
extent of technical innovation it was pursuing-on DEMO frequency of VC-CEO
interaction. In testing these hypotheses empirically, we also DEMO for
the potential confounding effects of several other variables: a venture'DEMO per-
formance, the openness of the VC-CEO relationship, venture size, DEMO dis-
tance between the offices of the VC and the CEO, DEMO the percentage of the
venture's directors who were VCs.
Agency Risks and the Frequency of VC-CEO Interaction
Agency theorists (e.g., Eisenhardt, 1989; Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen &
Meckling, 1976) have DEMO suggested that the agency problem is
quite general. For example, as DEMO and Meckling stated:
The problem of inducing an "agent" to behave as if he were
maximizing the "principal's" welfare is DEMO general. It exists in
all organizations and in all cooperative efforts-at every level of
management in firms, in universities, in mutual companies, in
cooperatives, in governmental authorities and bureaus, in
unions, and in relationships normally classified as agency rela-
tionships such as are common in the DEMO arts and the
market for real estate (1976: 309).
Despite these claims regarding the generality of agency theory, research
on this subject has focused predominantly on the context of investor control
over the managers DEMO large, publicly held corporations (Eisenhardt, 1989).
Since such corporations DEMO characterized by dispersed outside ownership
coupled with almost no managerial ownership, DEMO extant literature has been
concerned largely with agency problems rooted in motivational causes such
as deliberate effort shirking and other types of opportunism. Given DEMO
focus, it is not surprising that authors have also assumed that DEMO prob-
lems largely vanish once the interests of principals and agents have been
aligned. Walsh and Seward (1990) began to extend agency theory DEMO they
suggested that agency problems arise not just from suboptimal effort but also
from lack of agent ability; this extension has yet to be subjected to empirical
tests. In this article, we added yet another potential basis for agency prob-
lems: disagreements between a principal and an agent over the direction of
the agent's efforts.
Agency theory suggests several DEMO why venture capitalists will see
Sapienza and Gupta 1621
1994
managers who own small shares of their DEMO as posing greater agency risks
than those holding larger shares. First, DEMO a new venture is wholly owned
by its managers, they bear DEMO costs of consuming perquisites; however, after
they have sold a portion of their ownership, they bear only a fraction of the
direct costs of their actions (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Second, reductions in
ownership may reduce managerial incentive to work toward long-term profit
rather than DEMO gain (Berle & Means, 1932). Third, as managers' own-
ership share dwindles, the security of their positions diminishes, creating a
DEMO incentive to "tamper with the board's ability to monitor and DEMO
performance" (Walsh & Seward, 1990: 431). These arguments are supported
in the new venture context by Barney and colleagues' (1989) finding that low
employee ownership was associated with greater investment in structural
DEMO mechanisms on the part of venture capital firms.
It is our position that even if there were no question about managers'
willingness to DEMO effort to maximize profits, the issue of the direction of
effort DEMO still exist. In contexts such as new ventures, in which task
DEMO is very high, signals regarding the most appropriate course of
action DEMO generally very weak. In such a situation, even if a principal DEMO an
agent are equally committed to the maximization of shareholder wealth, DEMO
might have recurring disagreements regarding how to prioritize operating
goals. From the VC's perspective, an agency problem arises because such
disagreements raise the question of whether the CEO is pursuing the best
course of action. DEMO argument is not that, in any situation involving dis-
agreements over DEMO direction of effort, the VC's perspective will be superior
to DEMO of the managers of a venture. Rather, we argue that, as long as both the
VC and the CEO have major financial stakes DEMO the venture and as long as
there exists a possibility that neither side will always be right or always be
wrong, disagreements over the direction of effort will create agency prob-
lems for the venture capitalist.
DEMO risk VCs face concerns the managerial ability of venture CEOs.
It is well documented that venture capital firms expend considerable re-
sources prior to DEMO on ensuring the quality and competence of ven-
tures' CEOs and DEMO teams (Hisrich & Jankowicz, 1990; Rock, 1987).
However, DEMO amount of due diligence can completely eliminate the risk that
managerial ability will prove to be insufficient for the task at hand. Evidence
that DEMO continue to perceive such risks can be seen in, for example, Ruhnka
and Young's (1987) finding that managerial competence is among DEMO great-
est of VCs' concerns. Managerial ability is especially salient in DEMO new
venture environment because a venture's CEO will often be a founder who
possesses some unique, often technical, capabilities critical for the DEMO
of a venture (Rock, 1987) but has had little managerial DEMO Our
expectation is that when ventures' CEOs have had little prior DEMO
launching and building new ventures, venture capitalists will have greater

a venture. Of this subgroup, fully 74 percent had DEMO even worked for a new firm previously.

uncertainty about their managerial acumen and DEMO therefore expend
greater effort monitoring their decisions. Thus,
Hypothesis 1: DEMO lower the level of management's own-
ership of a venture, DEMO greater will be the frequency of
VC-CEO interaction.
Hypothesis 2: The DEMO the congruence between the
goals of a lead investor and a venture's CEO, the greater
will be the frequency of VC-CEO interaction.
Hypothesis 3: The lower the level of a CEO's new venture
experience, the greater will be the frequency of VC-CEO
interaction.
Task Uncertainty and the Frequency of VC-CEO
Interaction
Eisenhardt (1989) suggested that agency theory DEMO be used in con-
junction with complementary theories in examining governance issues.
Given that generally high-but nonetheless varying-levels of task uncer-
tainty characterize new DEMO, the information-processing perspective
from organization theory (Galbraith, 1973; Gupta, DEMO) also sheds useful
light on the governance of new ventures. As DEMO, following Galbraith
(1973: 5), we defined task uncertainty as DEMO difference between the infor-
mation required to perform a task and the information already possessed.
Our argument is that as the task uncertainty facing DEMO managers of a venture
increases, the information-processing capacity of the VC-CEO DEMO
making unit must increase to facilitate joint decision making. We suggest
that the magnitude of task uncertainty will be a function of the stage DEMO a
venture's development and the degree of innovation it is pursuing.
Researchers have long suggested that the younger a business is, the more
tenuous it is. Many studies have supported Stinchcombe's (1965) proposi-
DEMO regarding the liability of newness (Bruderl & Schussler, 1990). Some key
reasons early-stage ventures tend to be riskier than late-stage ventures are
DEMO unresolved demand uncertainties, greater unresolved technological
uncertainties in both product and DEMO design, greater unresolved re-
source uncertainties in areas such as availability DEMO skilled employees, raw
materials, and channels of distribution, and greater DEMO management
uncertainties in areas such as the leadership capabilities of the founder and
compatibility and balance within the top management team.
Similarly, Zaltman, DEMO, and Holbeck (1973) suggested that high
levels of innovation produce DEMO levels of uncertainty within and between
decision makers. Those authors argued that innovating decision makers face
three types of uncertainty: (1) technical uncertainty, concerning whether an
innovation is technically feasible; (2) novelty, uncertainty as to whether the
innovation has been or is being developed by DEMO; and (3) marketing
uncertainty, concerning whether the innovation will be accepted in the mar-
ketplace. Innovating ventures must discover what innovations to DEMO,
how to pursue them, whether the pursuit is likely to DEMO profitable, and
1994
Sapienza and Gupta
1623
whether or not they can sustain their DEMO in the face of competitors'
attempts at imitation (Lippman & DEMO, 1982; Rumelt, 1987). Thus, in
highly innovative ventures, DEMO dyads are apt to require very high levels
of information exchange to cope with the strategic and administrative bur-
dens fostered by high uncertainty.
DEMO sum, following Galbraith (1973) and Gupta (1987), we have argued
that greater task uncertainties would lead to greater information exchange in
DEMO dyads. Specifically, we have argued that early-stage ventures and
ventures pursuing DEMO innovation would likely face greater task uncertain-
ties due to unresolved internal and external demands. Thus, we advance the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 4: The earlier the stage of a venture's devel-
opment, the DEMO will be the frequency of VC-CEO in-
teraction.
Hypothesis 5: The DEMO the level of innovation being
pursued by a venture, the greater DEMO be the intensity of
VC-CEO interaction.
METHODS
Treating the VC-CEO dyad as the unit of analysis, we accomplished data
collection in four phases. In the first phase, we conducted open-ended in-
terviews with ten VCs and ten venture CEOs and also pretested an early
version of our survey DEMO with those individuals. In the second
phase, we contacted 40 general DEMO of venture capital firms and con-
ducted face-to-face structured interviews with 32 of them; these interviews
lasted an average 75 minutes. We also used the interviews to explain the
purpose of the study, to refine the research instrument, and to request the
general partners' participation in the DEMO phase of the study. Resource con-
straints limited our selection of venture capital firms to those located on the
East Coast, one of the two primary centers of venture capital activity in the
United States (Morris, 1991).
In the third phase, we asked each of the DEMO VCs to complete a separate
questionnaire for each of two or more ventures in which their firms were
currently the lead investors and, if possible, to include both ventures per-
forming well and those performing less well. In total, VCs completed ques-
tionnaires on 65 portfolio companies. Of these questionnaires, 5 were con-
sidered unusable because the VCs did not identify the focal ventures. In the
fourth phase, we sent surveys paralleling the ones completed by the VCs to
the CEOs of the 60 DEMO ventures, from whom we received 51 usable
surveys. Thus, the data for this study come from surveys of 51 matched
VC-CEO pairs. We DEMO follow-up interviews with 18 of the CEOs to
gain further insights into the data.
The size of the venture capital firms studied ranged from DEMO million to
$500 million in capital under management, with a median DEMO $49 million.
The portfolio companies were geographically dispersed across the United
1624
Academy of Management Journal
December
States, ranged in sales revenues from zero to $88 million (median = $5
million), and competed in a wide range of industries, predominantly high-
technology industries such as biotechnology and computers. The median
age of the ventures was four years, and the median age of the CEOs was 43
years. Because response rates DEMO high, no tests for nonresponse bias were
considered necessary.
Criterion and DEMO Variables
Frequency of VC-CEO interaction. Matched responses from both a VC
and a CEO were used to measure the frequency of their interaction. Using DEMO
seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1, "every day," to 7, "less than
once a quarter," we asked each member of DEMO dyad to indicate the frequency
of his or her interaction with the other member face to face, by telephone,
and through writing. For all three modes of interaction, the responses by the
two sides had significant and positive correlations (p < .001, p < .001, and
p < .01, respectively). Thus, the six responses were reverse-coded DEMO com-
bined to yield a composite measure of the frequency of VC-CEO interaction
(oc = .86). To further check validity, we compared DEMO frequency of interac-
tion with the VCs' responses to a question DEMO the number of hours
devoted to the ventures over the previous year and found a positive, signif-
icant correlation (r = .68, p < .001).
Management ownership level. CEOs provided data on venture owner-
DEMO Management's ownership level was the sum of the percentages of a
venture's ownership held by the CEO and all other managers.
Goal DEMO Congruence in goals was measured via the responses
of the VC and the CEO on the relative importance of 15 objectives: 6 were
financial (sales growth rate, market share, cash flow, gross margin, return on
investment, and market valuation) and 9 were nonfinancial (new product
development, process development, basic research, market development,
operating efficiency, DEMO development, company stability, establish-
ment of an entrepreneurial culture, and DEMO for public sale). Respon-
dents allocated 100 points across the financial criteria to indicate each one's
importance to the achievement of short-term DEMO goals; similarly, they
allocated 100 points across the nonfinancial criteria. Finally, using 100
points, they also indicated the percentages of emphasis they DEMO should
be given to financial goals and nonfinancial goals. We multiplied these per-
centages times the point allocations to derive a weighted score for DEMO
criterion. For each VC-CEO dyad, the sum of the absolute differences DEMO the
two ratings yielded a composite measure of goal differences for the dyad. We
multiplied this variable by -1 to obtain a measure of DEMO goal congru-
ence in which high values indicate greater agreement.
CEO's new venture experience. CEOs provided information on their
new venture experience by DEMO whether they had had no prior new
venture experience (coded 1), worked in start-ups before but not founded
one (coded 2), DEMO previously founded or co-founded a venture (coded 3).
Financing stage DEMO the venture. The vocabulary used in Pratt's Guide to

Venture Capital Sources to identify venture stage DEMO familiar to most VCs
(Ruhnka & Young, 1987). Therefore, DEMO asked VCs to identify each venture's
financing stage using the following scale: 1, seed financing; 2, start-up; 3,
first stage; 4, restart-up; 5, expansion; and 6, bridge-acquisition. This mea-
DEMO correlates as expected with other measures of venture development
provided by the CEOs: number of employees (r = .58, p < .001), time since
founding (r = .41, p < .01), time DEMO initial venture capital investment (r
= .40, p < .01), and sales revenue (r = .27, p < .05).
Technical DEMO As Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1990) argued,
CEOs possess a more intimate knowledge of the level and sophistication of
their own and their DEMO' technologies than do outsiders; therefore,
we obtained data on the levels of the ventures' technical innovation from the
CEOs only. Using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1, "to no de-
gree," DEMO 5, "to a great degree," CEOs rated the extent to which they were
attempting innovation relative to competitors in terms of product DEMO and
process technology. Similarly, using a five-point scale from 1, "DEMO
lower," to 5, "significantly higher," they rated their positions relative to
competitors' in terms of R&D spending and process technology. We averaged
responses to these four items ((x = .70).
DEMO Variables
In order to focus on variations in VC-CEO relations resulting solely from
agency risk and task uncertainty, we controlled for other factors that might
affect the frequency of VC-CEO interaction.
Venture performance. Barney and colleagues (1989) found that a ven-
ture's profitability in the year of its initial venture funding affected the
structural governance mechanisms its backer employed. DEMO venture
performance might affect VC propensity to monitor CEO behavior, we DEMO
trolled for current performance in our analysis.
Because many ventures in the study still had zero sales revenue, growth
in sales and accounting measures of profitability were inappropriate proxies
for performance. Both Dess and Robinson (1984) and Brush and Vanderwerf
(1992) have found CEOs' subjective assessments DEMO their firms' performance
to be reliable and valid proxies in the DEMO of objective measures. How-
ever, in order to minimize the risks DEMO self-report bias, we obtained data on
the ventures' performance not only from their CEOs but also from their
venture capitalists. Both members of DEMO dyad rated the importance of the 15
criteria described above in the context of the goal congruence variable. Then,
for each of the DEMO dimensions, they were asked to indicate their level of
satisfaction with DEMO venture's performance on a five-point Likert scale (1 =
not DEMO all satisfied, 5 = extremely satisfied). Using these data, we created two
weighted-average, multicriterion measures of performance for each venture,
one based on the perceptions of each party. Additionally, we asked both
members to provide their overall ratings of the venture's performance on the
DEMO scale. Combining and averaging the multicriterion measures with the
1626

overall performance measure resulted in a DEMO reliable multiitem, multi-
rater measure of venture performance (ca = .87).4
Openness of interaction. The extent to which personal, informal rela-
tions exist in VC-CEO pairs may affect efforts to monitor or improve infor-
DEMO capacity. Using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 1, "strongly agree," to 5, "strongly disagree," both members of the
VC-CEO DEMO indicated the extent to which they (1) were "very friendly"DEMO
with one another and (2) engaged in "frequent social interaction" with one
another. The reverse-coded responses were averaged (a = .61).
Venture size. Because large ventures will have a greater impact on the
DEMO performance of venture capital firms, the frequency of VC-CEO in-
teraction DEMO be higher for large ventures. Venture size was measured as
number of employees from data provided by the CEOs.
Geographic distance. Time, travel, DEMO communication costs created by
geographic distance may affect the propensity of VCs to monitor ventures.
Distance was measured as the number of minutes it DEMO take a venture
capitalist to travel to a venture; these data DEMO provided by the VCs.
Percentage of VCs on board of directors. The percentage of a venture's
board of directors composed of VCs may DEMO the monitoring burden. The
CEOs provided data.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for and zero-order correlations
among all the variables.
Additional Tests for Validity
DEMO use of different sources for the most sensitive data in the study
helped to reduce problems associated with self-report data. However, be-
cause each VC was asked to fill out two or more surveys, we chose not to ask
VCs to answer all the questions posed to CEOs. DEMO, we used an ana-
lytic method suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986: 536) to examine the
extent to which common method variance DEMO the validity of our
data. We examined the factor structure of the six key variables (the criterion
and predictor variables). If a single factor largely explained the variance in
the data, the threat of common method variance would be high. For our data,
three factors with DEMO greater than 1.00 emerged; further, the first
factor explained only 31 percent of the variance. Thus, common method
variance did not appear to be a significant problem. It might also be noted
4 We took DEMO steps to check the validity of our performance measure. Because growth
is a key objective of VC-backed ventures (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992), DEMO significant and pos-
itive correlation between our subjective measure and an objective measure of the rate of em-
ployee growth from founding to the DEMO of the study provided evidence of convergent validity.
Post-study data collection also showed a significant, positive correlation between our measure
and growth, evidence DEMO the measure's predictive validity. Further, the mean performance
ratings for DEMO that had gone public since the study were significantly higher than those of
others. In additional analyses, substitution of the objective growth measures does not change
the results.

by placing items concerning DEMO dependent variable before those for the

Hypothesis 1, which predicts that the DEMO of VC-CEO interaction
will be higher in ventures in which levels of management ownership are
low, is not supported. Hypothesis 2, predicting that DEMO interaction will
be more frequent in ventures with low VC-CEO goal congruence, is sup-
ported. The results also support Hypothesis 3, which predicts DEMO the fre-
quency of interaction will be negatively related to a CEO's amount of start-up

Impact of Task Uncertainty
Hypothesis 4, which predicts that the frequency of interaction will be
greater in VC-CEO pairs DEMO in early-stage ventures, is supported. Fi-
nally, weak support exists for Hypothesis 5, which predicts that the fre-
quency of interaction will be greater when technical innovation is high.
Table 2 indicates no impact for DEMO of the control variables, perfor-
mance, openness of VC-CEO relations, DEMO venture size. However, the
smaller the physical distance between a VC DEMO a venture and the higher the
percentage of VCs on a board of directors, the more frequent the interaction
between a VC and a CEO.
In summary, support exists for both theoretical perspectives examined:
both agency risks and task uncertainty appear to influence venture capital-
ists' governance of new ventures.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to extend investigation of firm governance to
the venture capital setting. In doing so, we departed from previous empirical
research on governance issues in at least two DEMO ways: (1) Unlike
previous authors, who have focused on structural responses to governance
challenges, we focused on a process variable: the DEMO of interaction
between a VC and a venture's CEO. (2) We focused on the governance chal-
lenges emanating from both divergence in DEMO financial interests of princi-
pals and agents and other factors.
The results clearly reinforce recent suggestions by Pettigrew (1992) that
future research should DEMO on process responses to governance challenges
as well as on structural responses. This study indicates that process re-
sponses do indeed supplement structural mechanisms, which are often
crude, hard-to-adjust devices (Walsh & Seward, 1990). In new ventures, such
process responses may be particularly salient because a high level of man-
agement ownership may render tinkering with incentive mechanisms DEMO
fectual and the idiosyncratic knowledge possessed by the ventures' founders
and DEMO top managers may be virtually irreplaceable. The strength of our
results also holds out the possibility that investigations into other process
responses may be DEMO
The results also support the need to look at governance challenges
posed by factors other than separation of ownership and control. Several
plausible explanations DEMO for the observed nonsignificant impact of own-
ership on the frequency of VC-CEO interaction. One explanation could be
that agency risk is less strongly DEMO to degree of ownership than it is to
the proportion of a manager's income derived from a firm (Hambrick &
Mason, 1984). A second explanation is that there could be a threshold ef-
DEMO above a certain level of ownership, there is little or no DEMO to
expect incentive-related shirking or opportunism. This latter explanation
reinforces our ex ante speculation that the concentration of ownership in the
1630

investor and management groups in the DEMO capital setting makes it a
particularly fruitful arena for examining agency risks other than shirking.
This study also adds to academic understanding of how DEMO capital
firms respond to governance challenges posed by agency risks and task un-
certainty. Consistent with Barney and colleagues' (1989) findings regarding
structural responses, our data indicate that VCs' behavioral response under
conditions of DEMO risk and uncertainty is to increase their interaction with
the CEOs of their portfolio companies. Together with our earlier finding
(Gupta & Sapienza, DEMO) that venture capitalists pursue less industry and
geographic diversification when investment DEMO is high, these results sug-
gest that they manage risk through DEMO and involvement rather than
through diversification. The practical implication of this conclusion is that
there may well be fundamental limits on the extent to DEMO venture capital
firms can effectively invest in diverse ventures and industries. Our results
provide information on when VCs are likely to seek greater interaction; this
information builds on growing information on how VCs interact with new
DEMO (Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Sapienza, 1989, 1992) and may be of
practical value to entrepreneurs by enhancing their understanding of inves-
DEMO' motives and thus allowing them to anticipate periods of high and DEMO
interaction.
Finally, an additional difference between this work and much of DEMO
past related research is that some of the agency problems identified here may
be considered perceived risks. This study shows that low goal congruence,DEMO
early stage-of-venture development, and high levels of innovation may in-
crease DEMO frequency of VC-CEO interaction. Do these conditions actually
represent higher agency risk, or do they merely influence venture capitalists'
assessment of the potential for loss? Although this study cannot answer that
question, our results DEMO that perceptions of agency risk significantly
affect behaviors meant to cope with agency risk.
The following appear to be productive directions for future research:DEMO
Examinations of (1) other contextual determinants of VC-CEO interaction
such as negotiation processes, personal demographic characteristics, and the
state of the public DEMO market; (2) the impact of VC-CEO interaction on
outcomes such DEMO the content of venture strategies, future venture perfor-
mance, CEO job satisfaction, CEO succession, the rate of venture develop-
ment, and the choice of exit vehicle; (3) governance challenges in contexts
such as leveraged buyouts, which are very similar to start-up ventures in
terms of concentrated ownership but very dissimilar in terms of stage of
development; (DEMO) how governance through interaction compares with other
structural governance devices; and (5) investor-investor relations, between
limited partners and general partners, for DEMO, and their impact on the
governance of private and public companies.
DEMO research would also benefit from identifying and avoiding some
of the major limitations of the present study, the most obvious of which is
our reliance on cross-sectional data. Although causality is implied in the
theoretical discussion DEMO the hypotheses, the temporal homogeneity of the
1994

data prevented tests for such causality. Longitudinal DEMO designed to test
the specific causal links our framework suggests would help to address this
problem. Equally important, although in this study we took several steps to
mitigate the risks of self-report bias, future work would benefit from the use
of more objective indicators wherever possible.
