Choice: Towards a Standard

Paul W.   Glimcher
INTRODUCTION
The goal of neuroeconomics is an algorithmic
description of the human mechanism for choice. How
far have we DEMO towards this goal? This volume
reveals just how much information has DEMO gathered.
The studies presented here have leveraged existing
scholarship to describe the mechanisms by which the
values of actions are learned, how and where these
values are encoded, how these valuations govern our
actions, and DEMO neural measurements can be used to
constrain social scientific models of human behavior.
With this information in hand, can we define the gross

will be of use to economists, psychologists, and neu-

My suspicion is that many of the DEMO contribut-

question is yes, and that the back-pocket models that
most of these scholars use to guide their research are
remarkably similar.

decision-making that incorporates the bulk of what
we know today. Of course such a DEMO, if taken seri-
ously by policy-makers, could be dangerous. Many
of the details of such a framework, even if all of those
details were supported by contemporary data, would
be both controversial and wrong. But a framework
that organizes the information we have, and serves
as a target for future challenges, may well maximize
the forward movement of our discipline. Such a scaf-
fold might make clearer what we do know DEMO what
we do not know; where we have made progress, and
where critical avenues remain unexplored. In that
spirit, and with the certain knowledge that the details
of the following framework are wrong, what follows
is a fairly formal presentation of a “ standard back-
pocket model DEMO for choice.
My goal in presenting this model is to explicitly
link neurobiological, psychological, and economic
studies of choice so that we can DEMO the implica-
tions of this structure for all three of our parent dis-
ciplines. Simply relating a chooser’s options to her
choices or simply DEMO patterns of brain con-
nectivity and activation would run counter to the
goals and spirit of neuroeconomics: What is called
for is a hybrid approach that rigorously mixes the
strategies and traditions of our fields so DEMO to explic-
itly maximize the number of constraints these par-
ent disciplines can impose on our understanding of
choice. In interpreting this approach, scholars trained
in only one of the parent disciplines may be initially
troubled. DEMO classical neurobiologists, this approach
may seem to include an overly formal DEMO of
conceptual objects to no particular end. For econo-
mists, the DEMO may seem overly algorithmic and
unnecessarily focused on cardinality. My own feeling,
however, is that the interaction of these constraints is
what makes neuroeconomics powerful. As I hope will
become clear in this chapter, the explicit ties to eco-
nomics will allow neurobiologists to rule out whole
DEMO of theories that have heretofore seemed rea-
sonable. The explicit ties to neurobiological data will
reveal that only a tiny space in the vast DEMO of
economic theory can be viewed as compatible with
the human neuroarchitecture. In any case, I ask the
reader’s forbearance in this regard. I mean the presen-
tation to be  neuroeconomic . I hope the presentation will
reveal two things: (1) that only a very specific set of
economic theories is supported by the available data,
and (2) that several very specific pieces of neurobio-
logical and psychological data are required to com-
plete the theoretical constraints on the architecture of
human DEMO
What follows, then, is a presentation in five parts.
The first section provides a quick overview of the
basic mechanism for which I DEMO to argue. This sec-
tion is not meant to be a defensible piece of evidence-
based reasoning, but rather an opportunity to sketch
out the shape of the coming argument. The second
section provides a formal DEMO of the mathemati-
cal and empirical objects used in the rest of the pres-
entation. For some this may seem superfluous, and
for others it may seem  ad hoc or overly restrictive. I
hope it will become clear as the exposition develops
that we require these particular objects DEMO link exist-
ing economic theory to empirical psychological and
neuroscientific data. The third section will provide a
detailed description of the evidence for a DEMO
neural mechanism of valuation – a detailed descrip-
tion of what we do and do not know about this proc-
ess, and a description of its surprisingly unitary and
linear nature. The fourth section provides an DEMO
view of the choice mechanism itself; those circuits that
take as DEMO inputs the outputs of the valuation
system and give as their output a plan of action – a
choice. The chapter concludes by highlighting DEMO
the strengths and weaknesses of this standard back-
pocket model.
INTRODUCING THE BASIC
TWO-STAGE MODEL
Growing evidence suggests that the basic mecha-
nism for DEMO choices in primates of all kinds
(a group which necessarily includes DEMO) involves
a two-stage mechanism. The first of these stages is
concerned DEMO the valuation of all goods and actions;
the second is concerned with choosing amongst the
goods or actions presented in a given choice DEMO At a
very basic level, one can think of the valuation DEMO
nism as being associated with learning and represent-
ing the values of objects and actions, and the choice
mechanism as being associated with a transformation
that takes as an input the values of the options under
DEMO consideration – the choice set – and stochas-
tically returns a high-valued option used to guide
physical action. Of course, the details of these mech-
anisms are subtle. Some features of the valuations
we infer from DEMO (what an economist would
call the  preference function ) seem to be attributable to
mechanical processes embedded in the choice mecha-
nism itself. DEMO example, the standard model suggests
that hyperbolic temporal discounting may arise DEMO
a mixture of exponential temporal discounting within
the valuation system and a set of divisive computa-
tions embedded in the choice mechanism (see, DEMO
example, Glimcher  et al ., 2007 ). The mapping between

the physical valuation mechanisms of the DEMO and
psychological notions of valuation will occasionally be
complicated. In a similar way, the anatomical bounda-
ries between the choice and valuation mechanisms
may not be entirely discrete. Our mixture of theoreti-
cal and empirical approaches DEMO make it clear that
neural activity in the  choice structures both DEMO and
does influence activity in the valuation structures. For
example, some DEMO in key valuation areas like the
striatum carry signals that encode choice. However, at
a global level, it now seems extremely likely that DEMO
architecture is organized around this basic two-stage
structure.
T he neurobiological evidence for a two-stage proc-
ess, which will be reviewed in greater detail below,
arises from several key observations which are sum-
marized only DEMO briefly here. Perhaps the first
explicit evidence for this segregation came from the
work of Platt and Gimcher (1999). In the first half of
that study, the authors recorded from neurons in the
posterior parietal cortex while thirsty monkeys viewed
two visual targets. In a typical trial, or round, the two
targets might be associated with different magni-
tudes of reward, and after an initial delay the animal
was informed which one of the two targets would
yield that reward on this trial. DEMO a choice-related
point of view, each round was a decision between DEMO
response that yielded no reward and a response that
yielded a small positively-valued reward. What Platt
and Glimcher found, however, was that during DEMO
early part of the trial (before the zero-valued target
was identified DEMO that trial) these neurons produced
firing rates almost linearly proportional to DEMO aver-
age value of the rewards that had previously been
earned for selecting that target. These firing rates car-
dinally encoded, in action potentials (or spikes) per
second, the average value of the targets, DEMO in a way
that  did not influence choice on that trial. DEMO was  “ as
if ” the mean expected utility of the DEMO  look at the
right target was linearly encoded by neuronal firing
DEMO independent of choice. This is a point that will
be developed in greater detail below, but the point I
want to make here is that at the time this was seen as
a major limitation of DEMO study, but in retrospect it pro-
vides some of the first DEMO evidence that valu-
ation and choice are dissociable.
At the same time, a huge number of studies from
many different sub-areas of neuroscience began to
suggest that broad swaths of the striatum and the
frontal cortex DEMO learn and represent the values of
goods and actions even when learning is passive
( Figure 32.1   ).  Delgado  et al . (2000)  and  Knutson  et al .
(2000) , for example, found that when humans pas-
sively viewed events that resulted in unpredictable
gains or losses, the level of neural activation in several
striatal and fronto-cortical areas was linearly corre-
lated with the magnitudes of these DEMO and losses.
This constituted preliminary evidence that these
value-encoding structures operate in the absence of
choice. (Of course, this analysis presumes that expe-
DEMO rewards and anticipating them for the pur-
poses of decision share a common neural substrate.
That this is true is now largely beyond dispute DEMO the
neurobiological level – a point that is developed later
in the chapter.) Subsequent studies confirm this ini-
tial observation. During both choice and non-choice
tasks, when humans face risky or certain gains, when
they DEMO delayed or immediate gains, the activation
of discrete frontal and striatal DEMO is almost always
near-linearly related to (subjective) measures of value.
The linearity of this relationship may be surprising
to economists, but this is not theory, it is simply an
empirical (and surprisingly common neuroscientific)DEMO
observation. These existing studies have made it clear
that the neural systems for valuation are both neuro-
chemically and anatomically localized.
The critical first DEMO towards this realization was p0080
the identification of reinforcement learning mecha-
nisms in the forebrain, and it is an understanding of
these learning mechanisms that has paved the way
towards a broader understanding of valuation. In DEMO
early 1990s, Wolfram Schultz and his colleagues (see,
for example, Romo and Schulz, 1990; Schultz and
Romo, 1990 ; Schultz,  et al ., 1993 ; also Chapter 21 in
this volume) demonstrated that midbrain dopaminer-
gic neurons encode a  reward-prediction error . These are
highly specialized and anatomically localized neurons
that broadcast a signal throughout DEMO striatum and
the frontal cortex. Montague and colleagues (1997; see
also Chapter 22 in this volume) provided the next step
when they recognized that this class of signal could
be used to construct a mechanism DEMO learns, through
trial-and-error, the values of actions or objects. What
followed was 10 years of work which established the
existence of at least DEMO inter-related subsystems in
these brain areas that employ distinct mechanisms for
learning and representing value, and which interact to
produce the valuations that guide choice (as summa-
rized in Chapters 12 and 24). This provided a set of
landmark findings summarized by the many chapters
in Part DEMO of this volume.
I n a similar way, studies of the DEMO control
systems of the brain revealed both the need for and
existence of a discrete choice mechanism. Although it
may not be obvious to DEMO, the proc-
ess of producing a movement at the biomechanical
level DEMO extremely complicated. Checking one of two
boxes on a retirement fund contract, or signaling

a choice with a rightward eye movement, requires
quite precise coordination of what may be literally
dozens of independent muscles. Each of these move-
ments, though, is a unitary DEMO that must be selected
and planned before it is executed. The hypothesis that
option values influence muscles directly is easily fal-
sified. When a DEMO moves her pencil towards a
checkbox on a page, the tip DEMO the pencil is moved by
over 30 muscles and joints with more than 7 degrees
of freedom. Still, the tip of that pencil traces a straight
line from start to checkbox with a Gaussian velocity
profile DEMO peaks about halfway through the move-
ment. Reaching for that checkbox reflects a move-
ment richly planned before it is executed. The most
introductory DEMO textbook reveals this fact.
Of course, we know where much of DEMO neural hard-
ware that plans and regulates movements is located.
Areas like the motor cortex, the premotor cortex, the
supplementary motor area, and Broadmann’s area 5
all coordinate the generation of goal directed move-
ments DEMO the arms. A similar (and better understood)
system coordinates movements DEMO the eyes. What this
means is that value signals must be turned into action
control signals somewhere within the nervous system,
presumably at DEMO above the level of motor cortex. It
is this process that neurobiologists refer to as a  choice
mechanism . What I point out here is that it is critical to
keep in mind that choice must DEMO accomplished before
movements are designed. The movement control sys-
tems reflect a  final common path before which choice
must, under normal circumstances, be complete.
Our current evidence suggests that the choice sys-
tem involves large DEMO of the parietal cortex,
amongst other areas (as summarized in DEMO 5 of this
volume). These parietal areas receive both direct and
indirect projections from the valuation areas, and
project directly to the movement control areas. One
issue that remains unclear, however, is how much
DEMO cortex and basal ganglia participates directly in
the choice process with these parietal areas. We now
know that specific neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex
(as reviewed here in Chapter 29) and the dorsal stria-
tum ( Samejima,  et al. , 2005 ; Lau and Glimcher, 2006 )DEMO
of the monkey also represent goods and actions that
have been chosen before these choices are executed,
but whether these neurons participate directly DEMO
choice is not known at this time.
This then, is a DEMO working outline of the pri-
mate choice system: a valuation system DEMO learns
through repeated sampling of the environment and
stores the values of actions and/or goods; a choice
system that uses these values to select (from amongst
a current choice set) a single option; and a motor con-
trol system that executes the physical responses dic-
tated DEMO the choice. Of course future experiments will
enrich this description – for example, it may well be
the case that perceptual systems influence the valu-
ation systems in ways that we are just beginning to
understand DEMO but these seem to be the fundamental
components of the primate architecture for choice as
we understand it today.
Before beginning to examine the DEMO and
choice systems in detail, however, it is critical that we
link these components to economic theory. This will
provide both important constraints DEMO how these sys-
tems operate and a common language for thinking
about these problems. In what follows, definitions for
conceptual objects explicitly linked to economic theory
are presented. While these definitions may initially
seem opaque to DEMO, neurobiological read-
ers are urged to take them seriously. The role DEMO these
objects is to serve, in essence, as mapping rules that
connect existing theoretical tools and empirical meas-
urements. At an earlier point DEMO the history of neuroeco-
nomics, it may have been valuable to DEMO in broadly
metaphorical terms when saying things like  “ this neu-
DEMO firing rate is like a utility signal ” (and in fairness,DEMO

DEFINING OBJECTS
I have probably been more guilty of this kind of DEMO
phor than anyone else – a looseness in language that I
now regret.). But as this field transitions to formal tests
of explicit DEMO powerful theories, this kind of meta-
phorical relationship between theory and DEMO becomes
more and more untenable. If we are to leverage the
precise and highly testable (if rarely tested) theories
of economics and psychology, then we must be able to
specify clearly  how we would test those theories with
neurobiological data – not just in a general way, but
in a specific computational sense. The kinds of objects
described below, I argue here, are what is required.
To many economists, a DEMO that will stand out
about these objects is that they will seem unnecessar-
ily restrictive. Linear relationships will be postulated
which do not seem DEMO From a logical point of
view, I agree. These, however, DEMO the objects for which
our empirical data calls. To many neurobiologists, DEMO
objects I have selected for definition may seem arbi-
trary. In the sections below, I hope to convince you
that the empirical data argue that these are called for
by our current data.
DEFINING OBJECTS
Expected DEMO Theory
As several chapters in this volume make clear, the
axiomatic DEMO in general and expected utility
theory in particular have both good and bad features
(for an overview of its advantages, see Chapter 3;DEMO
for an overview of its weaknesses see Chapter 11).
Formally, DEMO theory of expected utility ( von Neumann
and Morgenstern, 1944 ) DEMO on four axioms (or three,
in Savage’s 1954 formulation). DEMO our purposes, I
want to stress why these axioms are not DEMO set of
strange and arbitrary assumptions about how people
must behave, DEMO is an interpretation often given to
them by critics. The axioms are a statement not about
people (or the brain) in any sense; the axioms are a
precise definition of a theory. It is reasonable DEMO dislike
any theory, but it is important to stress that, counter to
what many lay people believe, this is a very minimal-
istic theory – much, much less restrictive and much
more intuitive than, DEMO example, temporal difference
theories of learning. If what neurobiologists studying
decision-making DEMO is a simple theory of how peo-
ple value things, then DEMO is important for them to real-
ize that economists already have several such theories,
and that the implications of these theories have been
DEMO well explored. When a class of behavior obeys the
axioms of a given economic theory, then we already
know quite a bit about the valuation systems that can,
505
in principle, underlie that behavior. It is for this reason
that neurobiologists need to link their measurements
to DEMO frameworks. This is the only way that
neurobiologists can rigorously exploit what econo-
mists have already learned about valuation.
To make this clear, consider expected utility theory, p0150
which will serve as my initial focus in the presenta-
tion that follows. Expected utility theory proposes
that choosers should (1) show complete and transitive
preferences, and (2) obey a DEMO separability con-
straint in a way that seems quite reasonable (amongst
DEMO things). Saying that a chooser obeys the axiom
of complete and transitive preferences is simply say-
ing formally that she could not be DEMO to:
1.     pay  1 cent and an apple DEMO an orange, then
2.     pay  1 cent and that orange for a pear,  and
3.     pay  1 cent and that pear for the original apple.
By the same token, saying that a chooser obeys the
separability axiom is simply the assertion that DEMO
cannot:
1.     prefer an apple to an orange,  and
2. prefer 1 cent and an orange to 1 cent and DEMO apple.
This is the reason that these axioms were included
in expected utility theory. What is interesting and
powerful about the theory, though, DEMO that any chooser
who obeys these rules (and the other axioms DEMO the
theory) behaves exactly as if she had a stable monot-
DEMO increasing utility function and as if her choice
behavior was aimed at maximizing her net utility
according to that function. Saying someone behaves
according DEMO these sensible rules is mathematically
equivalent to saying that it looks as if she is trying
to maximize some specific utility function. That is DEMO
important insight into valuation that neurobiologists
cannot afford to ignore. (Let DEMO stress here a point
that may not be entirely obvious: “ DEMO ” really  is
“ choice ” when these axioms are obeyed. DEMO is not
“ a feeling, ”  or  “ happiness, ”  or  “ a hedonic impulse. ”
Utility is a common scale DEMO valuation which gives
rise to choice when choice obeys these axioms. If
choice obeys these axioms, it is just  as if a utility DEMO
tion gave rise to these choices. Or, put the other way, if
you had a measured function having these properties,
and it DEMO perfectly predict choice then it  would be
a utility function and DEMO choices would of necessity
obey the axioms. Period.)
So what are these inferred utility functions like? A
subject who behaves according to the axioms behaves
“ as if ” she is maximizing some utility function, but
how heavily does even an infinitely large dataset of
choices constrain DEMO understanding of this func-
tion? To understand the answer to this DEMO, it is

necessary to understand three important features of
utility that DEMO not always been well enough appre-
ciated by neurobiologists.
1. Utility is ordinal
The answer is that observations of choice constrain
the shape, but not the scaling, of the function. We
might be able to show that her observed choices and
an assumption that she obeys the axioms DEMO the theory
are consistent with the idea (to take a simple DEMO)
that the utility of money to her could be described as:
Utility Dollars
06.
With this equation, we can predict whether she pre-
fers a sure gain of $10 over a 50% chance of DEMO, and if
the assumptions are correct for this chooser then our
DEMO is also correct. What is interesting to note,
though, is DEMO all of our predictions would also be
correct if we had written her utility function as:
or
Utility Dollars50
06.
Utility Dollars1000
06.
DEMO means that there are multiple equivalent rep-
resentations of this subject’s utility function. We can
predict choices by using any of these equivalent util-
DEMO representations, but the one we employ in a given
set of DEMO is arbitrary. It is for this reason that
economists refer to utility as an  ordinal scale  rather
than as a discrete cardinal scale. DEMO make the impor-
tance of this insight clear, consider a chooser DEMO pre-
fers apples over oranges and oranges over pears. If we
assume the axioms of expected utility theory for this
person, we can say that this behavior ranks the util-
ity of the three objects. We DEMO even arbitrarily assign
apples a utility of 1 and pears a utility of 0 (for this
chooser). Next, we could use lotteries (which of the
following do you prefer:  a 50% chance of DEMO apple and a
50% change of a pear or an orange ?) to place oranges on
this same scale, for example at a DEMO of 0.3. But con-
sider what happens when we suddenly introduce kiwi
fruits to the chooser and it turns out that she prefers
kiwis DEMO apples. Then the entire scale must be regener-
ated. This  is DEMO is meant when an economist writes
the word utility and it is no problem mathematically,
but it points up an important feature. Utility DEMO
are not cardinal sets of numbers that have definite
values that can be added and subtracted. They are
ordinally arranged relations between choice objects,DEMO
and this places important mathematical limits on
what you can (and DEMO) do with utility functions
as objects. The theory of value imposed DEMO expected
utility does not include predictions about the cardinal
relations of utilities by design. For a neurobiologist,
this imposes a particularly burdensome constraint. DEMO
implies that is meaningless to say that a neuron’s fir-
ing rate  is the representation of utility because such a
statement lies outside the domain of expected utility
theory. Neurons yield to us a fully cardinal DEMO
ment when we observe their firing rates. Firing rates
are numbers that can be added and subtracted in a
way that utilities cannot. If DEMO neuron had a firing rate
that revealed the desirability of an apple irrespec-
tive of the other objects placed before that chooser
(as in the study of Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008),
that neuron could  not be said to encode the utility of
apples, because one feature of this powerful theory is
that the utility of apples is not DEMO unique number. (It is
important to point out that this is DEMO simply a limita-
tion of expected utility theory; it is a DEMO of almost
all economic theories of value.) Of course that firing
DEMO could be linearly proportional to utility. If we
increase the number of apples presented to the subject
until the firing rate doubles we might DEMO able to con-
clude that utility has doubled, but utility and DEMO
rate would remain distinct in this important way.
2. The Axioms of Utility Theory are not Always
Consistent with Choice
Humans do, on occasion, both prefer an apple to an
orange and also prefer 1 cent and an orange to 1 cent
and an apple. This is (speaking a bit imprecisely) what
the Allais (1954) paradox shows (see DEMO 1 and
11 for more on this paradox). Of course, DEMO has impli-
cations for economics, but it also has a huge DEMO
tion for neuroscientists. If a neuron had a firing rate
that was always linearly proportional to utility, then
the firing rate of that neuron  could not be used to always
predict real human choice . A neuron with a firing rate
proportional to utility would – by definition DEMO obey all
of the axioms of expected utility. It could not generate
the Allais (1953) paradox, because that is the nature of
what is meant by  utility .
3. Utility Implies Agent Welfare/agent Well-
being
One of the most important functions of economics
is to tell DEMO whether a change in policy or government
will make people better off. Economists have often
argued that expected utility theory helps them make
this DEMO If, for example, all citizens were
to obey the axioms of expected utility theory, then

DEMO would have an easy time keeping them
happy or, more formally, maximizing their welfare.
Since a chooser who obeys expected utility always acts
DEMO maximize her own utility, then we can maximize
her welfare by DEMO her the freedom to choose
whatever she desires. This is a common (though not
necessarily ubiquitous) approach to figuring out how
to design DEMO that maximize the well-being (or
technically the welfare) of individuals.
It is important that neuroeconomists be aware of
this issue, because if a neurobiologist was to argue
that the firing rate of a neuron was DEMO propor-
tional to utility we might be heard as saying that
maximizing the firing rates of those neurons in your
citizens would be maximizing DEMO welfare, even if
the firing rate of that neuron  could not be used to pre-
dict real human choice . I think that DEMO need
very carefully to avoid making such a claim for the
foreseeable future. In almost all of the neuroeconom-
ics studied to date, we have tried to link activity in
the nervous system to choice behavior. DEMO volume
shows how much we know about the neural circuits
that give rise to choice. By contrast, we know very lit-
tle today about the neural circuits that give rise to an
individual’s sense of well-being. DEMO we did understand
those neural circuits, then we might be able DEMO make
some claims related to welfare issues in economics.
In Chapter 9, Bernheim argues that neuroeconomics
should adopt just such a focus in the future. In any
case, we do not have such expertise at this time, and
I want to take care to emphasize that it is the neural
mechanism of choice and not the neural mechanism
for experiencing DEMO that this standard back-
pocket model attempts to describe.
Defining Subjective Value (SV)
So the task before us is to ask, how DEMO we relate
neuronal firing rates, or measurements of the BOLD
signal, to the valuations of actions and objects that we
believe guide behavior? One way to proceed is to try
to relate these activation patterns DEMO expected utility.
Under many conditions expected utility theory does
predict choice, DEMO that seems to be an observation
that we do not want to overlook. On the other hand,
one of the reasons that we DEMO to develop an algo-
rithmic model of decision-making is that we have
every reason to believe that such an algorithmic model
would predict choice DEMO even when expected
utility theory cannot. So how do we gain access to
the theoretical power of expected utility theory with-
out becoming burdened DEMO its failures, and in a
way that respects the two-stage model DEMO valuation
507
and choice that is developing today? One has to DEMO
here that for many economists this is a critical point –
and one about which there has been much confu-
sion. To resolve this DEMO, I suggest the following
definition:
Subjective value : Subjective values, at least for the pur-
poses of this initial argument, are real numbers ranging from
0 to 1000. They take as their natural units DEMO potentials
per second. Subjective values have the following properties:
1.     Subjective values are equal to (or better yet defined as)
the mean firing rates of specific populations of neurons,
the identification DEMO which follows. For this reason, sub-
jective values are linearly proportional DEMO the BOLD sig-
nal as measured in these same populations.
2.     Subjective values predict choice stochastically. More for-
mally, I define them as the sum of true subjective value
and a noise term (see below). This means that subjective
value theory will be most closely DEMO with random util-
ity-type models from economics.
3.     When expected utilities predict choice behavior, subjec-
tive values are linearly proportional to those expected
utilities.
4.     Subjective values are  always consistent with choice,
though stochastically, even when choice is not consistent
with expected utility theory.
5.     Subjective values have a unique  reference-dependent
anchoring point called the baseline firing rate. All subjec-
tive values are encoded cardinally DEMO firing rates relative
to this baseline. This means that subjective value theory
will be most closely allied with reference dependent
forms of utility-type models DEMO economics.
Of course I recognize that some of these properties
will have to be relaxed, but probably not in impor-
tant ways. The BOLD signal and mean firing rates,
for example, are not exactly linear in their relation,
but these five statements capture the central features
DEMO subjective value around which our definition of the
choice architecture will be organized.
First and foremost, the definition I suggest here
allows us to be clear about why expected utility the-
ory will be enormously valuable DEMO the neuroeconomic
enterprise. Expected utility theory provides a compact
definition that, DEMO at least some circumstances,
describes patterns of choices.  Where that DEMO true , meas-
urements of utilities tell us unambiguously what SV
must look like to within a linear transformation. (This,
of course, DEMO that we can find a mean neuronal
firing rate that looks like a candidate for encoding SV,
but we turn to that in DEMO next section; for now, we
simply seek clear definitions of our goals.) Second,
this definition says that if we could actually measure
SV, we would be able to use those measurements to
predict behavioral violations of expected utility the-
ory, like the Allais paradox, as DEMO as human choice
behavior well captured by other approaches like pros-
pect theory. Third, SV must be subject-specific. This

follows, of course, from its relation to DEMO utilities of
expected utility theory.
SV is defined in units of average spikes per second
as an object that predicts the choices of individuals.
DEMO, I want to be clear that measurements of SV  do
not have clear welfare implications. Because SV does
not (at the very least) obey the independence axiom
globally (since human choice does not obey DEMO
axiom), maximizing SV will not yield a maximization
of something like a complete and transitive preference
function. Further, and probably more importantly, DEMO
predicts choice. Because we are modeling at an algo-
rithmic level, DEMO does not mean,  ex ante , that SV is
related to a chooser’s sense of well-being. That may
be mediated by other neural DEMO SV welfare
maximization and SV maximization should not be
equated.
To summarize, I define here the concept of subjec-
tive value which is meant to be a fully cardinal object
with several important restrictions. At least DEMO,
it cannot take negative values (an important point to
which DEMO will return). It has both a finite range and
finite (DEMO large) variance. The importance of this
point will be immediately clear DEMO neurobiologists.
For economists, it means that errors and stochastic-
ity in DEMO are unavoidable features of the archi-
tecture. This suggests properties related to random
utility models. The importance of this point will be
immediately clear DEMO economists. For neurobiologists,
it means that whenever choice behavior obeys the axi-
oms of random utility models we know a tremendous
amount about DEMO a final common valuation system
ought to be behaving. Following this line of reason-
ing, then, my hypothesis is that SV is encoded DEMO
in the valuation mechanisms of the human brain and
that existing economic theory tells us much about
how this representation must behave. As we DEMO
measurements to prove this, we will be able to place
additional DEMO restrictions on SV.
Finally, I need to make it clear that DEMO I am sug-
gesting is that one central goal of neuroeconomics
should be to develop a complete theory of SV. As
that theory is DEMO, it will continue to refine our
understanding of which economic theories DEMO better
than others at predicting SV. Random utility models,
for example, will be shown below to be better predic-
tors of SV than traditional utility models. Reference-
dependent utility models will also be shown to DEMO
better predictors of SV than traditional consumption
utility models. Whether traditional economists will
care that empirical constraints on SV can be used to
identify DEMO utility-based models as closer fits to the
human choice architecture will, DEMO course, be a matter
of taste.
Relative Subjective Value (RSV)
We define the relative subjective value of a single
option  j  DEMO:
RSVj 
SVj
∑ SV c
i
where  i is DEMO set of all options in a choice set (includ-
ing  j)  and c is an empirically measurable normaliza-
tion constant of the DEMO first described in the cerebral
cortex by Heeger (1992) . Our current evidence sug-
gests that choices are actually made between options
by DEMO RSVs after corruption by noise. The
evidence for this arises from work in parietal cortex,
which is summarized in Chapters 4, 28, DEMO, and 31.
Obtained Subjective Value (ExperSV)
ObtainedSV is a pattern of neuronal firing, much
like SV, which encodes the subjective value DEMO cur-
rent states of the world (let me stress again that
DEMO is not necessarily a welfare measure-
ment). The neural location of ExperSV is not known,
though the activity of dopamine neurons provides
DEMO evidence that it is present as one of the
midbrain inputs to those neurons. For reasons that
will be described below, ObtainedSV actually serves
as one source of the utility-like properties of SV.
Reward Prediction Error (RPE)
RPE is defined here as in learning studies and as
DEMO in Chapter 22. It is:

DEMO Terms
The existing neural data suggest two sources of
noise that influence choice: one at the level of the
valuation system and one at the level of the choice
system. In economic terms, the first can be viewed as
roughly corresponding to random utility distributions
( McFadden, 1974 ; Gul and Pesendorfer, 2008 ) and
the second as corresponding to the trembling hand
( Selten, 1975 ) notion of stochastic behavior. (DEMO

models in which it is assumed that the subjective val-
uations of options vary stochastically, but that choos-
ers always select the current best option from that

stochastically varying set. In these DEMO, it is the
perception of value itself that is hypothesized to DEMO
Perhaps surprisingly, these models place some very
interesting constraints on the DEMO between
value representations and choice. In contrast, trem-
bling hand models DEMO that stochasticity in choice
arises from errors during the choice process which
lead to the selection of suboptimal elements from
the choice set. These DEMO place other interest con-
straints on choice. One interesting signature of mod-
els of this type is a dependency of errors on choice set
DEMO) There is compelling evidence for both
such sources.
Subjective value noise DEMO a random term drawn from
distribution assumed to be Gaussian and added to  true
subjective value to yield SV. It is always present. The
variance of this term may or may not be adjustable.
Cortical noise DEMO choice is a final noise source
added (as a stochastic time DEMO) to RSV before choice
occurs. The source of this term is DEMO intrinsic to cor-
tical neurons, which requires that it be Poisson DEMO dis-
tribution at the mechanistic point of addition (see, for
example, Tolhurst  et al ., 1983 ). Neuronal pooling that
occurs DEMO the choice process, and adjustability of
the inter-neuronal correlation term, may be used to
reduce this variance ( Krug  et al ., DEMO ). For more on the
theoretical implications of this, see  DEMO (2005) .
Valuation Mechanisms and Subjective Value
Formally (and of DEMO too simplistically), sub-
jective value (and terms that inherit properties DEMO
subjective value) can be seen as a neuronal sum of
the DEMO:
SVj 
∑ i ω x
∑ i ωi
iij
where the term  i indexes each of the neurons in the
brain,  i is the firing rate of the  i th neuron, and  ωi  is
a weight ranging from 0 to 1 describing the additive
contribution of that neuron to the SV of object or action
j DEMO This object places into the language of economics
the standard neurobiological insight that a weighted
sum of neurons in topographic maps encodes behav-
iorally DEMO variables (for more details on this
neurobiological issue, see Lee  DEMO al. , 1988.) The sub-
jective value of a particular object DEMO the external
world,  j , is thus simply represented as the average
weighted firing rate of a subpopulation of neurons
that encodes the DEMO value of that object.
(This of necessity excludes non-linear interactions
x
DEMO
like those encountered in a game theoretic specifi-
cation of SV. While it is not necessarily my intent to
exclude these other kinds of DEMO, the available
data suggest that SV actually is linear with these DEMO
ing rates. In any case, this definition could be relaxed.)
DEMO a topographically mapped action-encoding region
like the superior colliculus, this is DEMO to saying
that activity in a restricted region of the map encodes
value for a particular action. I should note, however,
that this definition specifically excludes distributed
non-linear encoding schemes – a constraint that could,DEMO
at a later date, also be relaxed.
For an empirical neurophysiologist DEMO functional p0480
magnetic resonance imager looking for SV  in the
brain, two questions then become paramount:
1. Is there a firing rate DEMO (or a BOLD activation
in the case of fMRI) we can identify in the brain
that is linearly correlated with the utility of DEMO
or objects (when utility predicts choice)?
2.     What is the most compact population of neurons
(both in number of neurons and in anatomical
extent of the population) that can maintain this
linear correlation with SV  (i.e. the smallest
population of neurons for which DEMO is not equal
to zero).
The data we have available today suggest that two
brain areas seem likely to contain all the neurons DEMO
require to extract SV for any object: the ventral stria-
tum DEMO the medial prefrontal cortex.
THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE
VALUATION SYSTEM
If one accepts that (1) mammals evolved to learn
the values of DEMO states of the world both when
their actions influenced those states and when they
did not, and (2) that choices (the selection DEMO
available options) must be complete in the nervous
system before actions DEMO be planned and executed,
then one can hypothesize that valuation must be at
least partially autonomous of choice and that the proc-
ess DEMO choice must be complete before action is pro-
duced. These hypotheses seem to have been validated
by a wealth of empirical research in neuroscience
DEMO over the past couple of decades. Indeed,
amongst neurobiologists there is essentially universal
agreement that a group of neural systems for valua-
tion DEMO been identified.
Almost certainly, the critical historical event that
pointed towards DEMO common neural system for valu-
ation was the study of learning and dopamine, a

topic reviewed in detail in Part 3 of this volume.
Understanding why the study of dopamine DEMO to pos-
tulates about valuation, however, requires an exami-
nation of the history of dopamine. In the 1920s, the
German physiologist Otto Loewi established that neu-
rons communicated with each other through a chemi-
cal DEMO we now call neurotransmission. His
groundbreaking work established the existence, how-
DEMO, of only one neurotransmitter through which it
was believed all neurons DEMO The existence
of multiple neurotransmissive systems was revealed
in 1964, when DEMO and Fuxe (1964) visualized
adrenaline-, noradrenaline-, and dopamine-containing
neurons. These measurements revealed a set of ana-
tomically and neurochemically discrete brain systems,DEMO
a structural feature of the nervous system that had not
been previously identified. Of particular interest, for
our purposes, was the discovery of DEMO to three groups
of dopamine containing cell bodies that projected from
the midbrain (from two areas called the  substantia nigra
pars compacta ,  SNc , and the  ventral tegmental area ,  VTA )
to the basal ganglia and the frontal cortex ( Figure 32.2 ).
By the 1970s and 1980s it had become clear that many
drugs of DEMO acted through this system, suggesting a
role for dopamine in hedonic DEMO
Learning Subjective Values

The critical breakthrough that allowed modern
studies of valuation to crystallize around the mid-
brain dopaminergic pathways, however, was DEMO
work of Schultz and colleagues (1993). These authors
measured the DEMO activity of single dopamine
neurons while monkeys passively received rewards
during a classical conditioning task (see Chapter 22
for more details). They found that  unconditioned
rewards produced a strong response in these neu-
rons, DEMO conditioned rewards did not. This was an
important finding, because it DEMO that the activity
of dopamine neurons  could not simply code hedonic
DEMO This led Montague and colleagues (1997)
to propose that dopamine DEMO encoded the dif-
ference between expected and obtained rewards;
the  DEMO error of learning theory. What
followed was a host of papers that established that
dopamine firing rates could be described as:
DA spks DEMO ExpectedR ExperiencedR(/) ( )α
where DA is the instantaneous firing rate of VTA and
SNc dopamine neurons,  ExpectedR is the magnitude
DEMO the reward expected by the subject at this time,
ExperiencedR is the magnitude of the reward being
experienced by the subject at this DEMO, and  α is a

ing rate as described below and in Chapter 22. If

where  j indexes actions or goods and  t indexes time,DEMO
then  Q represents a current estimate of the expected
value of DEMO or good  j . For economists, I note this is
a recursive form of the Bellman equation computing a
reversed discount function in DEMO  α describes a  for-
getting rate .
A very interesting feature of this system, which
is, however, often overlooked, is the DEMO in which
ExperiencedR encodes the magnitudes of rewards
being received. Consider a primary reward like water.
If  ExperiencedR encodes water in milliliters, then
DEMO  converges towards a representation of expected
value in milliliters. If, however,  ExperiencedR  encodes
something like the utility of water, or more DEMO
it encodes  ObtainedSV , then the system converges
not towards a DEMO of expected value but
towards a representation of SV. This point is critical
because neural systems of valuation must estimate
real-world values through processing DEMO sensory and
neural devices, and any previous upstream trans-
formation of DEMO is propagated through the
system – thus, if volume encoding afferents DEMO the
tongue, like all sensory afferents that have ever been
studied, encode a Stevens Power Law ( Stevens, 1970 )

compressed representation of volume, then the set
of Q  s computed from dopaminergic activity would
encode (or inherit) a power function representation of
magnitude. It seems almost DEMO that this has to be
the case, given that every sensory DEMO ever stud-
ied employs a power law for compression (see, for
example, Stevens, 1970 ). This leads to speculation that
the encoding mechanism for primary rewards serves
as at least one (if not the) source for the curvature of
the utility function amongst primary rewards. It is
also a possibility that this may offer some insight into
the DEMO of reference dependence in human choice
behavior.
For these reasons, it DEMO tempting to speculate
that dopamine neurons should receive as an input
ObtainedSV from which their target neurons learn SV
directly, thus accounting for the source of curvature
in the utility functions for primary rewards with the
DEMO hardware for sensory encoding. Of course this
places some interesting constraints on how the DA
neurons should work. They cannot, for example, code
DEMO (relative subjective value) with regard to a finite
choice set, DEMO if they did then SV could not be
computed from them. The pre-existing body of eco-
nomic theory makes this clear. If they did DEMO RSV,
the stored SV of a good or action would be depend-
ent on the choice set within which it was learned. As
DEMO result, the choice mechanism would be unable to
obey the axioms DEMO complete and transitive preference
which both humans and animals often obey.
This is an observation, however, that may seem at
first blush to DEMO data in the literature ( Tobler
et al ., 2005 ), and this apparent contradiction is impor-
tant because it highlights the power DEMO economic the-
ory in neuroscience. These data suggest that the RPE
signal measured in the dopamine neurons is vari-
ance dependent. As the variance DEMO the reward stream
increases the magnitude of the dopamine firing rate
for a given  ExpectedR  ExperiencedR goes down.
Theory tells us, however, of the importance of com-
plete and transitive preferences and what they DEMO
for valuation mechanisms, and seems to suggest that
ExpectedR  ExperiencedR DEMO scale with the vari-
ance of the choice set and still preserve transitivity in
the stored representation of value. The resolution of
this apparent DEMO is that it must be the learning
rate, and not  ExpectedR  ExperiencedR itself, which
scales with variance. In other words, we DEMO say that
if subjects are transitive behaviorally, we can reject
the DEMO that  ExpectedR  ExperiencedR  scales
with variance. (In fact, this scaling of the learning rate
with variance is a feature of efficient DEMO systems
– a fact well described in any mathematical treatment
of the Kalman filter.) And our ability to make this
statement comes from the explicit linkage of theory
and measurement. Of course, this also raises the pos-
sibility that violations of complete and transitive pref-
erence – when DEMO violations do occur – may reflect
features of this measurable set of computations.
In any case, the dopamine neurons broadcast this p0580
signal throughout the frontal cortex and basal ganglia –
also suggesting a role for DEMO of these areas in learn-
ing. The observation that the firing rates of dopamine
neurons encode the difference between expected and
obtained reward is DEMO, because it reveals that the
inputs to the dopamine neurons include DEMO signal both
of both the value of the reward that was received and
the value of the reward that was expected – clear evi-
DEMO that a valuation signal of some kind, an object
we have DEMO as  ObtainedSV,  must exist. To be
more precise, there is now some compelling evidence
that dopamine firing rates encode only positively
valued, or near positively valued, reward-prediction
errors ( Bayer and Glimcher, 2005 ). There have been
hints of this in the literature for some DEMO ( Hollerman
and Schultz, 1998 ). The suggestion here is that posi-
tive and negative RPEs may be encoded separately
in the nervous DEMO ( Daw  et al ., 2002 ). The idea of
DEMO the RPE term into negative and positive
elements should be naturally attractive to behavio-
ral economists. We have known since the work of
Kahneman DEMO Tversky (see, for example, Kahneman
and Tversky, 1979 ; also Chapter 11 of this volume)
that human choosers are more sensitive DEMO losses than
to gains – a feature known as loss aversion. If posi-
tive and negative RPEs are coded by different systems
and those DEMO map positive and negative values
of  ExpectedR  ExperiencedR to firing DEMO with differ-
ent gain terms, then the ratio of these two DEMO
ent gain terms could well account for some features of
loss aversion.
Though most of the work described above was con-
ducted in animals, there is clear evidence that these
dopaminergic neurons behave in the same DEMO in
humans as they do in all other living mammals. Like
other mammals, humans find dopaminergic drugs
reinforcing. Like other mammals, humans have DEMO
same dopaminergic pathways. Like other mam-
mals, dopaminergic drugs can be DEMO to bind to
receptors in the terminal fields of these neurons. But
the best evidence for the notion that a circumscribed
learning-based valuation system DEMO with
dopamine occurs in humans comes from fMRI stud-
ies of humans engaged in learning about rewards.
In 2002, two groups ( O’Doherty  DEMO al ., 2002 ;  Pagnoni
et al ., 2002 ) DEMO simultaneously that activity
in the dopaminergic terminal fields of the striatum and
the frontal cortex during both gustatory and monetary

reward tasks behaved exactly as predicted. This indi-
cated, basically beyond a reasonable doubt, that DEMO
existed a valuation-learning system in the striatum
and frontal cortex of humans. So to summarize, this
leads me to suggest that dopamine neurons lead to the
direct computation of SV under some conditions:
jt
jt DEMO jt() ()11
SV SV SV ObtainedSV α()
p0630
DEMO
where SV is the subjective value of object or good
j , which is learned from repeated experience, as esti-
mated at time  DEMO . Note that, as mentioned above,
ObtainedSV for primary rewards DEMO a compressive
function of  ExperiencedR , as is really required by DEMO
we know of sensory encoding systems. This means
that risk aversion, DEMO least over primary rewards, is
the product of Weber-type encoding mechanisms DEMO
our sensory apparatus.
What remains, then, is to understand where and
how SV is mechanistically computed and stored. Two
lines of evidence contribute DEMO our understanding of
these issues: neuronal recording studies in animals
and DEMO studies in humans. The recording studies in
animals have now established that the basal ganglia
contain essentially all of the computational elements
required for DEMO execution of reinforcement learning
(or, more precisely,  temporal difference learning) algo-
rithms. There are, for example, neurons within the
basal ganglia that encode the magnitude of reward
that an animal expects to receive DEMO producing a
particular behavioral action, neurons that encode the
actions that DEMO just been executed, and neurons
with firing rates dependent on the DEMO state of the
environment, amongst other things. These neurons
are located DEMO the striatum and project out of the basal
ganglia largely through the ventrolateral nucleus of
the thalamus, which in turn projects back to the fron-
tal cortex. Single unit recording studies in the frontal
cortex have DEMO demonstrated the existence of neu-
rons that encode values, but this DEMO the values of
goods, not of actions (see Chapter 29). fMRI studies
in humans tell a similar story (see Chapters 23 and
24 for more details), suggesting that frontal and basal
ganglia circuits DEMO the core of the human mecha-
nism for RPE-based value learning.
There is, however, evidence for other learning
mechanisms in these same structures DEMO interact
with this well studied RPE-style learning mechanism.
The details of these other learning systems are still
being worked out, but what is known to date is
described in Chapters 12 and 24 of this volume. DEMO
essence, these studies suggest that a set of mechanisms,
most DEMO not all interacting with dopamine, provide
tools for learning and representing DEMO in the frontal
cortex and the basal ganglia.
F or a neuroeconomist, then, these studies constitute
overwhelming evidence that a value system exists
DEMO can be functionally localized. Where, then, is the
final point of convergence at which SVs are passed to
the choice system? Put more formally, in a preceding
section I argued that subjective value can be seen as a
neuronal sum of the form
SVj 
∑ i DEMO xij
∑ i ωi
where the term  i indexes each of DEMO neurons in the
brain, x i is the firing rate of DEMO  i th neuron, and  ωi
is a weight ranging from DEMO to 1 describing the addi-
tive contribution of that neuron to the SV of object or
action  j.  The question we need to DEMO is whether
there is an anatomically discrete neuronal population
that can supply all the non-zero values for  ω  required
by the choice system.
DEMO way to begin to answer this question is to look
at the existing fMRI data and ask: is there a small
number of areas that are actively correlated with SV
under essentially all reward and choice DEMO
that have ever been studied? Perhaps surprisingly, the
answer to this question seems to be yes: the ventral
striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex show up in
dozens of studies under essentially all choice condi-
DEMO as coding something like SV.
Activity in the ventral striatum has been shown
to be correlated with both rewards and punishments
( Delgado  et al ., 2000 ), the magnitude of cumulative
rewards (Elliot  DEMO al ., 2000), the anticipation of reward
(Knutson, 2000; Knutson  et al ., 2003 ), the expectation
of monetary reward ( Breiter  et al ., 2001 ), the expecta-
tion of primary rewards ( O’Doherty  et al ., 2002 ), the
receipt of monetary rewards ( Elliott  et al. , 2003 ), mon-
DEMO expected values ( Knutson  et al ., 2005 ), behavio-
DEMO preference rankings amongst rewards ( O’Doherty
et al ., 2006 ), potential gain magnitude and loss mag-
nitude as scaled by subject-specific levels DEMO loss aver-
sion ( Tom  et al ., 2007 ), DEMO discounted reward value at
delays ranging from minutes to 6 months ( Kable and
Glimcher, 2007 ). Single unit recording studies of the
DEMO striata of monkeys, both in the caudate ( Lau
and Glimcher, 2006 ) and in the putamen ( Samejima,
et al ., 2005 ), tell a similar story. Neurons in these areas
have been identified which clearly code action val-
ues. All of these data suggest DEMO whenever rewards
are received or preferences are expressed, activity in
the DEMO striatum encodes the magnitudes of those
rewards or preferences. (However, one possibility that

THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE VALUATION SYSTEM
513
needs to be ruled DEMO is that activity in the ventral
striatum encodes only reward-prediction errors and
not SV  per se . Available single unit data rule this out in
all other areas of the striatum, but the definitive study
has not yet been conducted in the ventral striatum.)
A similar story DEMO to hold in the medial prefron-
tal cortex. Activity in this area has been shown to be
correlated with monetary reward magnitude (       Knutson
et al ., 2000, 2003 ), preference ordering DEMO
primary rewards ( McClure  et al ., 2004a ), the DEMO
value of a lottery ( Knutson,  et al ., 2005 ), the subject-
specific valuation of gains and losses ( Tom  et al ., 2007 ),
the subject-specific discounted reward value ( Kable
and Glimcher, 2007 ), and willingness to pay (Plassman
et al ., 2007). Activity in this area appears to be corre-
lated with valuation under all of these conditions.
This leads me to propose DEMO mean activity in
the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral stria-
tum encodes SV. Different neuronal subpopulations
in these areas must encode different options, and
so these areas must employ a complex topographic
encoding scheme which DEMO the populations
that encode the SVs of different actions or goods. The
details of this encoding scheme, which probably lies
beneath the resolution of fMRI, are only just begin-
ning to be understood, and the DEMO schemes
employed by the two areas are almost certainly differ-
ent. The medial prefrontal cortex, because of its closer
relationship to goods-related encoding areas like the
orbitofrontal cortex, may well encode SV in terms
of goods, while the VS may employ an action-based
encoding scheme. But in any case, I propose that these
two areas serve as the final common representation of
SV for use by the choice mechanism.
To be quite DEMO, I propose that the mean activ-
ity in subpopulations of the DEMO prefrontal cortex
and the ventral striatum encodes SV when options are
under consideration for choice or the objects of cur-
rent learning. It is DEMO activity which, I argue, both
guides choice and encodes the reward prediction (SV)
that is used in learning (probably as resident DEMO the
ventral striatum). This information, I suggest, is stored
throughout a much larger network of areas span-
ning the frontal cortex and DEMO basal ganglia in the
synaptic strengths connecting neurons in these areas,
the strengths of these synapses being set by the well
understood biophysical DEMO of dopamine-
dependent long-term potentiation and long-term
depression (and perhaps based DEMO the actions of other
plasticity generating neurotransmitters like serotonin).
When instantaneous subjective value is represented, it
reflects, I propose, the sum of activity passing through
these synapses located in areas including the inferior
frontal DEMO, the insula, the amygdala, the posterior
cingulate, the superior temporal sulcus, the caudate,
the putamen, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,DEMO
and impinging on the ventral striatum and the medial
prefrontal cortex.
What we know about the biophysics that would be p0680
required to instantiate DEMO process have two impor-
tant implications that need to be mentioned. First,
recall that all neurons have a limited dynamic range
and a DEMO finite level of stochasticity in firing
rate. This means that instantaneous SV is necessarily
drawn at each instant from an underlying distribu-
tion. This DEMO requires that the notion of SV be
closely related to random utility models (and not tra-
ditional von Neumann-Morgenstern utility) from eco-
nomics. DEMO, it needs to be noted that all neurons
have a “ DEMO  firing rate, and neurons in these
areas are no exception. Recently, Tom and colleagues
(2007) have shown that activation in these areas con-
tinuously represents gains and losses on a common
scale with an DEMO point at a zero-gain point in
these experiments. This suggests that baseline spike
rate in these populations is the unique representation
of the reference DEMO for SV’s reference-dependent
encoding of value. Of course this conclusion, even DEMO
correct, does not constitute a theory of the reference
point; it simply identifies an empirical technique for
direct measurement of the reference point.
DEMO
Unlike valuation, which has been extensively stud-
ied in both humans DEMO other animals, choice has been
the subject of study principally in DEMO
monkeys in neuroscience. This may reflect the fact
that the temporal dynamics of choice make it difficult
to study with fMRI. In any case, an understanding of
choice requires an understanding of existing work in
non-human DEMO
Initial studies of choice in monkeys evolved almost
simultaneously from studies of sensory-perceptual
systems (see, for example, Newsome  et al ., 1989 ) and
movement control studies (e.g.  Glimcher and Sparks,
1992 ). The most important of these studies examined
how monkeys used noisy DEMO signals to
identify one of two orienting eye movements, or sac-
DEMO, as reinforced. They did this by leveraging an
extensive pre-existing literature DEMO the structure of
the visual and eye-movement systems to search for
the decision-making circuits which connected them in
these tasks (details of this line of study can be found in
Chapters 4, 28, 29, and 31 of this volume). Subsequent
work has generalized many, but not all, of these

findings to arm-movement control systems and to
studies of humans.
We have to DEMO, therefore, with a review of the
basic structure of the saccadic control system ( Figure
32.3 ). The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in the pos-
terior parietal cortex is one of the critical elements DEMO
this system, and it consists of a roughly topographic
map both DEMO objects in the visual world and the eye
movements that would required to align gaze with
those objects (for a review, see Glimcher, 2003 ). Thus,
a particular location on the map (or DEMO precisely the
neurons on the map at that location) activates when
DEMO visual stimulus appears 10° to the right of fixation,
and that region might become particularly active mil-
liseconds before an eye movement which DEMO gaze
10°. This area, in turn, projects both to the frontal eye-
fields and the midbrain superior colliculus, two addi-
tional topographic maps that are broadly similar in
function. The frontal eye-fields project, as well, to the
superior colliculus directly. A final note is that many
of these areas are reciprocally connected (for a review
of this anatomy see Platt  et al. , 2003) , a fact which is
probably DEMO for understanding choice. Finally,
the colliculus is connected to brainstem circuits that
actually govern eye movements in real time. The
connection between these DEMO systems and the
colliculus are mediated by a class of collicular neurons
called “ burst ” neurons. Burst neurons have the inter-
esting biophysical DEMO that they can fire action
potentials in either of two states: DEMO continuous low-
frequency state in which many different firing rates
are observed, and a burst state characterized by a
fixed and extremely high firing rate.
It is widely assumed that actual generation of a
movement involves DEMO the collicular burst neu-
rons above a specific firing-rate threshold, after DEMO
a burst occurs that is self-perpetuating and persists
until the movement is complete. Inhibitory inter-
connections in the collicular map seem to preclude
burst-like DEMO occurring at more than one loca-
tion at a time, suggesting DEMO the collicular architec-
ture allows only a single movement to be executed
at a time. Studies in area LIP, the frontal eye-fields,
and the superior colliculus all indicate that low-
frequency firing in all three DEMO related to the probabil-
ity that a movement will be executed by the animal.
To be more specific, if a particular movement is likely
to yield a reward, then activity in all three maps at the
locations associated with that movement is elevated.
Of these three maps, the one that has been most stud-
ied with regard to decision is DEMO In LIP, it has been
shown that if the magnitude of DEMO reward or the likeli-
hood of a reward is systematically manipulated, DEMO
firing rates in these areas are a roughly linear function

of those variables under many conditions. To be yet
more precise, current data suggest that activity in this
map encodes relative subjective value (RSV) DEMO the
type defined above.
Together, these data suggest the following model
DEMO eye-movement generation. At any moment in time,
neurons in LIP represent the instantaneous RSV of
each movement in the saccadic repertoire. Movements
that DEMO non-zero values are thus each represented
by local activity on the map that is linearly proportion
to RSV (see, for example, Dorris and Glimcher, 2004 ).
I hypothesize that the representation of SV localized
DEMO the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral stria-
tum serve as the initial source of this signal. Previous
studies have noted that other (and perhaps all) corti-
cal areas perform a divisive normalization on their
input data ( Heeger, 1992 ; Schwartz and Simoncelli,
2001 ). DEMO has now been observed that (at least to a first
approximation) this also occurs in area LIP ( Dorris
and Glimcher, 2004 ; Sugrue  et al ., 2004 ;  Louie  et al .,DEMO
2007) , and the result is likely a shift from SV DEMO RSV in
the posterior parietal cortex.
RSV, it should be noted, would serve to map SV
into the limited dynamic range of the DEMO neurons.
LIP neurons are limited in number, fire over a roughly
DEMO dynamic range, and have (errors that are
drawn from a) DEMO distribution. This means
that the representation of RSV, rather than SV, in this
structure may solve an important problem. The shift
to RSV DEMO a distribution of the SVs of the cur-
rent choice-set over the limited dynamic range of these
neurons. Unfortunately, the finite dynamic range and

noise associated with these neurons may also impose
a constraint. DEMO the choice set becomes larger, noise
may swamp the signal, leading to profound inefficien-
cies when selecting amongst large numbers of possible
movements. DEMO is tempted to speculate that this
may, in fact, be a neural account for the choice-set size
effects which have recently been examined DEMO human
choosers (see, for example, Iyengar and Lepper, 2000 )DEMO
It may also be that processes like choice set editing are
tools used by frontal areas to winnow the size of the
choice set DEMO on in parietal areas.
It should also be noted that the Poisson variance of
these neurons may serve a useful function by allow-
ing DEMO stochasticity in behavior under conditions in
which behaviors like mixed strategy equilibria arise.
It was Nash who noted that mixed strategy equilibria
arise when DEMO expected utilities of the strategies
being mixed are equivalent. In a similar way, when
the RSVs of two options are equivalent it might be
expected that the stochastic nature of these neurons
yields mixed-strategy behavior. If DEMO neurons are
always stochastic in their behavior – a hypothesis that
has been largely documented in monkeys – patterns
of activity in LIP may DEMO related to economic notions
of the trembling hand ( Selten, 1975 ).
In summary, then, the available data suggest that
at all DEMO of these areas – LIP, FEF, and SC – carry
signals encoding RSV, and that movements occur
when activity associated with one of the positively-
valued options drives its associated collicular neurons
into their burst DEMO A tremendous amount of work
(again summarized in Chapters 4, 28, 29, and 31)
has examined this process of movement-triggering
under DEMO in which animals are instructed
to make movements as quickly as possible. Less is
known about how movement selection is triggered in
non-reaction time DEMO One important possibility
is that an input to one or more of these areas alters the
inhibitory interactions within the map, forcing conver-
gence to a single action.
The basic model proposed for selecting eye move-
DEMO is thus that signals encoding SV project
to these areas, probably DEMO LIP, which nor-
malizes those signals to represent RSV which
is DEMO contaminated by local noise, the degree of
which across the entire DEMO may be regulated
by adjustable inter-neuronal correlations ( Glimcher,
2005 )DEMO These signals propagate recursively through
these networks while reflecting SV inputs that may
be entering the maps at many locations. An exter-
nal signal DEMO permits, or forces, convergence of the
network to a single choice which occurs when the
collicular neurons are driven above their burst
threshold.
DEMO evidence for this hypothesis has been p0780
gathered by Louie and Glimcher (2006),  who have
shown that early in a trial the DEMO of LIP repre-
sent the RSV of discounted gains associated with spe-
cific saccades, and that it is only later in the trial that
these same neurons come to encode information about
the actual choice made DEMO the animal. This seems to
suggest that the basic model is sound, at least for tasks
of this type.
Two questions, however, immediately arise: how
does this system achieve choice amongst more abstract
objects that do not have specific movements associated
with them, and does this model generalize to humans
and non-eye movement conditions? A limited amount
of data exists which suggests that this general class
of system does operate under DEMO in which
choices are made between more abstract objects. Gold
and Shadlen, for example, demonstrated that when
animals must choose between red and DEMO targets
that constantly interchange locations, activity in the
superior colliculus reflects DEMO instantaneous mapping
between color and value even if this changes from
trial to trial ( Gold and Shadlen, 2000 ; see also Horwitz
and Newsome, 2001; Sugrue  et al ., 2004 ). This clearly
indicates that the saccadic choice circuit has access to
instantaneous mapping information DEMO abstract
properties to actions. It cannot tell us however, how
choice DEMO accomplished (or if it can be accomplished)
in the absence DEMO any mapping to motor circuitry of
any kind.
We do, however, have some interesting hints
that these choice circuits are interconnected with
important DEMO areas in the frontal cortex and
basal ganglia. Padoa-Schioppa and Assad (DEMO) , for
example, have demonstrated the existence of neurons
in the orbitofrontal cortex that encode an animal’s
choice before the movement expressing that DEMO is
executed. In a similar way, Lau and Glimcher (2006)
have observed choice neurons in the dorsal striatum.
At the very least, this suggests that the choice cir-
cuit can send information about decisions DEMO,
but it may also indicate that these areas participate
directly in the convergence process by which choice is
accomplished.
T he question of DEMO these circuits that have
been so well studied in monkeys can be generalized
to other classes of movements and other species is one
about DEMO we have much less information. We do
know that adjacent to area LIP are areas specialized
for arm, hand, and face movements. Standard DEMO
suggest that a group of areas lining the intraparietal
sulcus serve as movement-control interfaces for all
of the body, although there are problems still being
resolved with those hypotheses ( cf .  Levy  et al DEMO, 2007 ).

But it does seem clear that the general theories of
movement control advanced for the monkey DEMO have
analogues in the skeletomuscular system. Further,
injuries to any of these systems, in either humans or
monkeys, leads to permanent deficits DEMO in the mus-
culature but in the ability to produce movements.
Finally, a small number of fMRI studies have shown
value-related signals in the posterior parietal cortex,
although these signals are almost always of weaker
DEMO than in more frontal areas. This, of course,
raises the DEMO that the weaker fMRI signal
reflects the temporal dynamics of choice observed in
the Louie and Glimcher (2006) study. Because subjec-
tive value DEMO only represented until a decision is made,
in these areas the magnitude of the SV signal, inte-
grated over an entire trial, DEMO be much less than in
areas located more frontally where SV is represented
throughout a trial.

ALTERNATIVES TO THE
TWO-STAGE MODEL
Choice DEMO
Some early models of the primate choice system
proposed that when choosing between two actions
a choice probability was computed directly from
the identity DEMO the option pair, rather than by com-
paring something like the DEMO of the two
options under consideration. This choice probabil-
ity was then proposed to stochastically direct action.
When these models were introduced, some argued
that they could serve as an alternative to preference-
based models.
Two DEMO argue against models of this type.
The first is axiomatic. Consider an agent who has
been asked repeatedly to choose between choco-
late and DEMO Then she is asked to choose repeat-
edly between apples and crackers. We can, of course,
represent the behavior of the agent with two choice
probabilities. If we begin, however, with the assump-
tion DEMO the chooser represents  only choice probabili-
ties, then we must necessarily remain agnostic about
what the agent will select if we offer her DEMO choice
between chocolate and crackers. If, on the other hand,
DEMO hold a belief that knowing her choices under these
first two conditions reveals her likely choice under
the third condition, then we are basically assuming
complete and transitive preferences that invoke a
utility-like representation. In other DEMO, we invoke
a system which behaves “ as if ” abstract DEMO,
subjective values, are represented.
The second factor arguing against this DEMO
is empirical. We now have compelling neurobiologi-
cal evidence that subjective values of some kind are
represented in the brains of monkeys ( Dorris DEMO
Glimcher, 2004 ;  Sugrue  et al ., 2004 , Louie and Glimcher,
2006 ; Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008). In those
experiments and others like them it has been dem-
onstrated that the DEMO values of individual
options, and not choice probabilities, are represented
by neuronal firing rates.
For these two reasons we can consider choice-
probability-only DEMO systems as empirically and
theoretically falsified. Of course, it may well DEMO that
groups of neurons (or the local ensemble connections
of those DEMO) do explicitly represent choice prob-
abilities. Some evidence suggests that this DEMO be the
case in posterior parietal cortex, but we now have DEMO
ficient evidence to conclude that the representation
of subjective values – or something much like them –
occurs within the central nervous systems of DEMO
Multiple Selves
The principle alternatives to the standard back-
pocket model presented here are the multiple-self
models that employ summation of some kind. These
DEMO typically propose the existence of two largely
independent decision-making systems; one DEMO
ated with so called  “ limbic ” areas of the brain DEMO
the other with so called  “ rational ”  areas of the brain.
While tremendously interesting from an economic
point of view, these models are, for the most part, at
variance with the majority of DEMO existing corpus of
neurobiological data . However, it is still germane DEMO
ask whether the existing evidence supports a two-
agent model of decision-making of the type proposed
by Laibson and colleagues (see, for example, Laibson,
1997 ;  McClure  et al ., 2004b ). DEMO that model, it is argued
that the basal ganglia and medial DEMO cortex
form an emotional decision-making module which
interacts (additively) with a second system organized
around posterior parietal cortex and the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, which form a rational decision-
making module. Anatomical considerations that
weigh against DEMO hypothesis aside, we must ask
whether or not there is compelling DEMO that the
division of brain areas into emotional and rational
subgroups as can be supported by the available data.
My answer is no. In DEMO, it has now been con-
clusively shown that activity in the DEMO pari-
etal cortex predicts preferences under all conditions
that have been studied – for immediate rewards and
for delayed rewards ( Janssen and Shadlen, 2005 ;

Louie and Glimcher, 2006 ), for large rewards and for
small rewards ( Platt and Glimcher, 1999 ; Dorris and
Glimcher, 2004 ), and for high-probability and low-
probability rewards ( Shadlen and Newsome, 1996 ;
P DEMO and Glimcher, 1999 ). The data from animals seem
to be unambiguous here – LIP activity predicts choices
for both rational and emotional DEMO
To take another example, let us turn to the basal gan-
DEMO This is an area that a number of neuroeconomists
have argued is associated with emotional decision-
making, but there is almost no evidence for this claim.
Diseases of the basal ganglia are only very weakly
associated DEMO emotional dysfunction. The many
dopaminergic forms of learning described in Part 3 of
this volume, although largely mediated by the basal
ganglia, do DEMO seem to capture any clear notion of
emotionality. A similar case can be made for studies
of the medial prefrontal cortex. As noted above, there
is evidence that this structure encodes monetary and
primary rewards, preference, expected values, and
gains and losses, and at least one study reports that
it encodes long-delayed monetary gains. Indeed,
even loss-aversion seems DEMO be encoded in the unitary
activity of this structure. Together, these DEMO paint a
picture of a structure globally involved in valuation –
not a structure driven exclusively by immediacy, fear,
or emotionality.
In summary, then, our available evidence seems
to suggest that existing multiple-self models DEMO
largely unsupported by the bulk of our existing data.
Of course, DEMO do influence decision-making and
choosers do show varying levels of self-control; DEMO is
beyond doubt. The question is, how do emotions and
circuits DEMO to self-control effect this influence?
The amygdala, to take one DEMO, may provide an
answer. The amygdala projects strongly to the ven-
DEMO striatum and there is physiological and anatomi-
cal evidence that activity in the amygdala strongly
influences activity in the ventral striatum. That does
argue DEMO the amygdala, and perhaps the emo-
tions that it encodes, can influence valuation-related
activity in this area, but it does not make a compel-
ling case for a Freudian multiple-self model of neural
decision-making.
CONCLUSION
DEMO emerges from a review of the available
human and animal data on decision-making is
evidence of a two-stage model for choice. The first
(or valuation) stage learns and represents the values
of both actions and goods. Within this stage, at least
three learning mechanisms distributed in the basal
ganglia and frontal cortex contribute to the construc-
tion of what we DEMO to as subjective value. These
areas are hypothesized to learn subjective values, at
a biophysical level, through the well-studied process
of synaptic plasticity. DEMO learning processes oper-
ate both during choice and during the passive receipt
of rewards, effecting a disassociation between choice
and valuation.
Our available evidence makes it clear that subjec-
tive value is a stochastic quantity, effectively drawn
from a spiking distribution dependent on these syn-
aptic strengths. It DEMO also a reference-dependent quan-
tity, as indicated by the Tom  et al . (2007) study. In this
regard, subjective value is most closely allied to a
reference-dependent random-utility model in eco-
nomic theory. I DEMO that SV is encoded specifically
in the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex and the
ventral striatum. I note that while SV is responsible
DEMO preferences, it can violate the axioms of expected
utility theory; indeed, it must if it is to account for true
preferences. Some of these violations doubtless reflect
the influence of emotion-related brain structures on
medial DEMO cortical and ventral striatal activity.
Choice, I propose, is accomplished in a network
that includes the posterior parietal cortex and a
number of DEMO areas subsequent to it
in the motor control stream. In these areas, the SVs
of objects within a single choice set are normalized to
RSVs. These RSVs are further modified by the addi-
tion of a DEMO noise term, of Poisson-distributional
origin, prior to a winner-takes-all operation that
accomplishes choice itself. This is a feature remi-
niscent of the trembling DEMO of economic theory in
some important ways. Let me stress that the winner-
takes-all choice operation must be broadly distributed,
and involves structures DEMO range from the superior
colliculus to the orbitofrontal cortex.
Of particular interest are several features of the
model that remain unspecified. While there are DEMO
candidate pathways by which information from the
medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum may
influence activity in the posterior parietal cortex, which
of these pathways is critical for choice has not yet been
determined. It DEMO also been noted (see Chapter 29) that
much of the posterior parietal cortex encodes SV with
regard to actions, while neurons in the orbitofrontal
cortex ( Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006 ), and perhaps
the DEMO prefrontal cortex, encode SV with regard to
goods. We do not DEMO how a transformation between
these representations occurs, although we do know
DEMO it does occur. We also have only limited informa-
tion about the systems that “ decide to choose. ” In some
tasks animals have DEMO be trained to make a choice as

soon as possible, and under these conditions one can
observe the parietal and frontal networks converg-
ing towards choice. In other situations, however, the
time-courses of DEMO and choice are separable, as
is more typically the case in DEMO economic behavior.
This suggests the existence of a circuit that can essen-
tially force the parietal networks towards convergence.
Such a system would almost DEMO involve cortical
networks of inhibitory connections, but the features of
this DEMO that decides when to choose remain com-
pletely absent from this standard back-pocket model.
Over the course of the past decade an extraordinary
amount DEMO progress has been made in identifying the
basic features of the primate mechanism for choice,
and there is remarkable consensus about much of DEMO
mechanism. This is a device that can be the subject
of economic study, and the existing neurobiological
data clearly identify some areas of economic theory as
more relevant to the study of this device than others.
DEMO existing theory also identifies questions that must
be answered by neurobiology. That, of course, is the
whole point of this endeavor.
