For many decades, social psychologists have attempted to DEMO
fluence people’s attitudes to elicit corresponding behaviors (see
Ajzen, 1991; DEMO & Fishbein, 1980; Ajzen & Madden, 1986;
Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 1996; Fazio, 1989, 1990; Fazio, Chen,
McDonel, & Sherman, 1982; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; for a recent
review of the effects of attitude-influence strategies on real-world
behaviors, see Albarracı´n et al., 2003). For example, a message
reporting the DEMO of a new vaccine may stimulate perceptions
that the vaccine is indispensable. Hence, it may increase the
probability that people will opt to receive the vaccine. Important
for our analysis, however, inducing provaccine attitudes at DEMO
pointintimedoesnotguaranteethatpeoplewillchoosetoreceive
the vaccine (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Albarracı´n et al., 2003).
Instead, there is considerable variability in the degree to which
attitudes predict behavior (Ajzen, 2000): Mean correlations be-
tween attitudes DEMO actual behaviors have ranged from .20
(Leippe & Elkin, 1987) DEMO .73 (Fazio & Williams, 1986).

Given large variability in attitude–behavior consistency, re-
searchers have specified conditions that make attitudes predict
behaviors (Borgida & Campbell, 1982; Fazio & Zanna, DEMO,
1978b; Kraus, 1995; Schwartz, 1978; Sivacek & Crano, 1982).
Past research has revealed that attitudes people hold with confi-

attitudesalsopredictbehaviorbetterthanambivalentorinternally
inconsistent ones. Similarly, easily recollected attitudes predict
behavior better than DEMO that are difficult to recall. Further,
attitudes based on direct experience promote greater attitude–
behavior consistency than those based on indirect experience (for
a meta-analysis, see Kraus, 1995).
Despitethevalueofpastresearchonmoderatorsoftheattitude–
behaviorrelation,therearetwolimitations.First,pastresearchon
these DEMO has often been correlational (e.g., Bagozzi, 1981;
Bentler & DEMO, 1981; Davidson & Jaccard, 1979; Fazio &
Williams,1986;DEMO&Zanna,1978a;Lavine,Thomsen,Zanna,
& Borgida, 1998). Thus, it has not been able to demonstrate
whether attitudes predict behavior because DEMO are more confi-
dent,memorable,ordecisive.Second,thepastresearchrelyingon
experimental methods (see Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Fazio, Powell, &
Williams, 1989; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Sengupta & Fitzimons,
2000; Wilson, Dunn, DEMO, Hyman, & Rotondo, 1984) has been
insufficient to conclusively establish the processes underlying the
attitude–behaviorrelation.Tofurthercomplicatematters,8outof
10 prior meta-analyses of the attitude–behavior DEMO (i.e., Ar-
mitage & Conner, 2001; Eckes & Six, DEMO; Farley, Lehmann, &
Ryan, 1981; Kim & Hunter, DEMO; Notani, 1998; Sheppard,
Hartwick,&Warshaw,1988;VandenPutte,1993;D.S.Wallace,
Paulson,Lord,&Bond,2005)focusedontheroleoffactorsother

behavior link, DEMO type of topic or behavior moderates the
attitude–behaviorrelation).Theremaining2meta-analyses,which
did consider the role of attitudes (i.e., Cooke & Sheeran, 2004;
Kraus, 1995), were more descriptive than process oriented.
ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION
779
In light of this situation, the objective of our work is to begin
resolving this deficiency by pooling evidence from experimental
DEMO quasi-experimental designs that dealt with attitude formation.
That is, we selected DEMO about creating a new attitude in an
audience, be that by DEMO information or by identifying
situations in which participants learned about a new object in
real-world settings. These studies varied in their use of diverse
DEMO manipulations (e.g., number of attitude expressions,
distraction, consistency among DEMO components, personal rel-
evance).Theyalsovariedinotherfactorsthatpresentedincidental
differences across studies (e.g., the DEMO and stability of
attitudes, the relation between attitudes and behavior-relevant in-
DEMO, and the confidence with which attitudes were held).
Therefore, synthesizing these studies permitted us to examine the
influenceofallthesevariables.Thesynthesiswasconductedwith
theguidanceofamodeloftheprocessesthatunderlietheattitude–
behavior correspondence.
To DEMO, two theoretical perspectives have specified the pro-
cessesbywhichattitudesguidebehaviors.Theseapproacheshave
also pointed to DEMO that moderate these processes. A first
approach assumes that attitudes influence behavior when actors
activate them from memory. Attitudes appear to be easily acces-
DEMO (and thus influential of behavior) when they are based on
direct experience (Regan & Fazio, 1977). They are also more
accessiblewhenthepeoplewhoformthemarehighlymotivatedto
DEMO about the attitude object (Cacioppo, Petty, Kao, & Rodri-
guez,1986).Itisassumedthatbothdirectexperienceandpersonal
involvement induce individuals to think about their attitudes. In
turn, this cognitive work increases the frequent availability of
attitudesasabasisforfuturebehavior(Petty,Haugtvedt,&Smith,
1995).
A different line of research suggests that attitudes influence
DEMO when actors can reconstruct them on the fly. According
to the constructionist point of view, constructing initial and later
attitudes on the basis of the same information makes the initial
attitudes stable (Erber, Hodges, & Wilson, 1995) and thus predic-
tive of behavior (Wyer & Srull, 1989). It is important to note that
attitudes should be most stable when the information that guided
them continues to be relevant or DEMO at the time the person
performs the behavior (Ajzen, 1996). In addition, people can
construct stable attitudes if all the information they have about an
object is one-sided or homogeneous (Erber et al., DEMO). People
whoanticipateonlypositiveoutcomeswhentheyformanattitude
toward a behavior may maintain the same attitude in light of
different outcomes that are also positive. In contrast, individuals
may change their attitudes when these attitudes are based on
information with diverging DEMO implications at different
points in time.
Clearly, there is much high-quality DEMO on the attitude–
behavior correspondence. However, this research has not been
DEMO into a comprehensive model. For example, researchers
havefoundthattheattitude–behaviorrelationisstrongerwhenthe
measuresofattitudeandbehaviorarecorrespondent(e.g.,Ajzen&DEMO
Fishbein, 1977; Davidson & Jaccard, 1979; Jaccard, King, &DEMO
Pomazal,1977).Itisalsostrongerwhenindividualsdonotexpect
to discuss their attitudes with others (Leippe & DEMO, 1987).
Further, the relation is stronger when there is an association
betweenattitudesandinformationrelevanttothebehavior(Ajzen,
1996;Doll&Ajzen,1992)andthefocus(e.g.,thoughtsaboutthe
instrumental DEMO of an object) is the same while the person
is reporting DEMO attitude and performing the behavior (e.g., an
instrumental rather than hedonistic behavior; Millar & Tesser,
1986, 1989). Likewise, consistent attitudes (Jonas, Broemer, &
Diehl, 2000), attitudes formed on the basis of direct behavioral
experience(Regan&Fazio,1977),andattitudesformedwithhigh
motivation to think about the attitude object (Sivacek & Crano,
1982) all appear DEMO predict behavior better. However, empirical
research has not explicated why these DEMO hetero-
geneousfactorshavesimilarimpact.Furthermore,whenresearch-
ers have linked some of these factors to the accessibility and
stability of attitudes (e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; DEMO et al.,
1982;Fazio,Powell,&Herr,1983;Houston&Fazio,1989),they
haverarelytestedallofthepathsrepresentingtheseprocesses(but
see Doll & Ajzen, 1992).
Finally,findingsregardingtheattitude–behaviorrelationarenot
as robust as they appear. For example, ambivalent attitudes have
often influenced the attitude–behavior relation in a negative way
(Conner, Povey, Sparks, James, & Shepherd, 2003; Conner et al.,
2002). However, there is research (e.g., Jonas, Diehl, & Broemer,
1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002) showing a positive relation. Sim-
ilarly, attitudes based on direct experience reportedly predict be-
havior(Regan&Fazio,1977).However,researchhasalsoshown
DEMO this is not always the case (Millar & Millar, 1996).
Giventhescopeanddiversityoftheattitude–behaviorresearch,
meta-analytical methods are ideal to integrate the findings and
resolve DEMO It is notable, however, that the attitude–
behaviormeta-analysesaddressingthisproblemtodatehavebeen
limited. For instance, Kraus’s (1995) meta-analysis found that
attitudes influenced behavior when attitudeaccessibility,stability,
certainty, affective–cognitive consistency, and direct experience
withtheattitudeobjectwerehigh.Similarly,CookeandSheeran’s
(2004) DEMO found that attitude accessibility, stability, certainty,
ambivalence, direct experience, and affective–cognitive consis-
tency influenced the attitude–behavior relation. However, their
analyses investigated neither the interrelations among these mod-
erators nor the processes underlying their DEMO on the
attitude–behavior relation. To the extent that the different moder-
ators are highly correlated, the univariate associations with the
attitude–behavior association may be spurious. Therefore, in the
presentmeta-analysiswehavemorepreciselyidentifiedtheunique
contribution of each moderator and tested the causal mechanisms
at hand.1
1 There are at least eight other meta-analyses DEMO have explored issues
concerning attitude–behavior correspondence. Kim and Hunter (1993)
DEMO the effect of the correspondence between the attitude and the
behavior measures across different topics. D. S. Wallace et al. (2005)
assessedtheimpactofsituationalfactorsassociatedwiththebehavior(e.g.,
perceived difficulty of the behavior, social constraints to perform the
behavior). Eckes and Six (1994) examined the influence of measurement
correspondence, time interval between attitude and behavior measures,
number of behavior alternatives, and behavioral domain. Two other meta-
analyses focused on the theory of DEMO action and the factors that
moderate the relations proposed by that theory (i.e., Farley et al., 1981;
Sheppardetal.,1988).Theremainingthreeexploredtherelationsproposed

GLASMANANDALBARRACI´N
Another limitation of prior meta-analyses is that they have
includeddesignsthatdonotrevealtheinfluenceofattitudeacces-
DEMO and stability. This situation is problematic. For example,
both Kraus’s (DEMO) and Cooke and Sheeran’s (2004) meta-
analyses found that attitude DEMO, consistency, and stability
wereassociatedwithgreaterattitude–behaviorcorrelations.How-
ever, these studies could not determine DEMO stable reports of
attitudes resulted from greater attitudinal confidence and consis-
tency.Infact,stableattitudereportscanalsocausemoreconfident
and consistent attitudes. Similarly, Kraus (1995) and Cooke and
Sheeran (2004) found that highly accessible attitudes were stron-
ger predictors of DEMO However, their approach cannot pre-
ciselydeterminethedirectionofthiseffect.Thatis,anassociation
of accessible attitudes with DEMO in an integration of research
using familiar objects might indicate that past experiences with
those objects caused both accessible attitudes and behavior.
To resolve DEMO deficiencies, we selected studies on the
attitude–behaviorrelationinwhichexperimenterscreatedattitudes
about unfamiliar objects. Correspondingly, we excluded studies
involving manipulations or measures of attitudes toward well-
known DEMO The focus on new attitudes helped us to control
various aspects of attitudes. That is, participants cannot have
previousattitudestowardunknownobjects.Hence,attitudesabout
these objects must largely reflect the information and conditions
present at the time of the attitude DEMO In addition, the
stability and accessibility of new attitudes should be DEMO
independentofpastthoughtsabouttheissue,pastbehaviorsinthe
particular domain, and past attitude reports. One cannot control

measured or manipulated all these aspects of attitudes.
Finally,thefocusonattitudeformationhasimplicationsforthe
solution of real-world problems. Private and public agencies fre-
quently face the challenge of DEMO new behaviors (e.g., pur-
chase of hybrid and electric cars, DEMO in a newly recom-
mended health screening, purchase of a new DEMO category,
introductionofanewpoliticalparty).Theseagenciesoftenattempt
to meet this challenge by eliciting behavior-congruent attitudes.
With the current state of the literature, however, it is unclear
DEMO it is more effective to discuss the advantages (e.g., Jonas
et al., 2000) or the advantages and disadvantages (Jonas et al.,
1997;Sengupta&Johar,2002)ofanewbehaviororwhetheritis
bettertoletaudiencesacquireexperiencewiththebehavior(Fazio
& Zanna, 1978a, 1978b; Regan & Fazio, 1977). Therefore, a
well-organized body of knowledge DEMO this topic is essential.
Processes Involved in the Attitude–Behavior Relation
Two lines of research have implications for the attitude–
behavior relation. One has established DEMO easy-to-retrieve atti-
tudes predict behavior better (Fazio & Williams, 1986). In addi-
tion, constructionist perspectives (Schwarz & Bohner, 2001;
Wilson & Hodges, 1992; Wyer & Srull, 1989) suggest that stable
DEMO on which to form attitudes ensures high attitude–
behavior relations. These processes appear in Figure 1.
Attitude Accessibility
AccordingtoFazio(1989),people’sattitudesaremorelikelyto
guidebehaviorwhentheyareeasytoretrievefrommemory.There
are two main premises for this hypothesis. First, more accessible
attitudes are likely to be available as criteria for a later behavioral
decision(Fazio,1989;Fazioetal.,DEMO;Fazio&Williams,1986).
In addition, accessible attitudes influence the interpretation DEMO
information associated with the attitude object (Fazio et al., 1983;
Fazio & Williams, 1986). For example, people with accessible
negative DEMO about African Americans who encounter an
African American man holding a tool may perceive the man as
holding a weapon (Allport & Postman, DEMO).
In brief, accessible attitudes allow people to make behavioral
decisionsandprocessrelevantinformation(DEMO,1989).Further,
ifattitudeaccessibilityincreasestheattitude–behaviorassociation,
soshouldconditionsthatincreaseattitudeaccessibility.Forexam-
ple, attitude–behavior correspondence is particularly DEMO when
peoplethinkcarefullyabouttheissue(Cacioppoetal.,1986).Itis
assumed that more thought about an issue increases the accessi-
bility of the attitude associated with that issue. In DEMO, re-
peated expression of the attitude and direct behavioral experience
are DEMO with both greater attitude accessibility and greater
attitude–behavior correspondence (Fazio et DEMO, 1982; Powell &
Fazio, 1984; Regan & Fazio, 1977). In all, this research suggests
that greater amount of thought about the attitude object, greater
number of reports or expressions of the attitude, and more direct
behavioral experience should increase attitude accessibility and,
consequently, attitude–behavior associations (see the upper sec-
tion of Figure 1).
DEMO Stability
People often retrieve and use their prior attitudes as a basis
for a behavior. However, they also adjust these attitudes on the
basis of information available at the time of the behavior
decision (Schwarz & Bohner, 2001; Wilson & Hodges, 1992).
Thus, the stability DEMO information associated with attitudes can
increase attitude–behavior correspondence (Ajzen, 1996; DEMO
& Ajzen, 1992). As shown in Figure 1, the behavioral rele-
vance, the one-sidedness of the attitude-related information,
and the confidence with which the attitude is held all stimulate
attitude stability.
Behavioral relevance DEMO attitude-related information. Presum-
ably, the stability of the information that gives DEMO to attitudes
increases the attitude–behavior relation. Hence, people should
display greater DEMO correspondence when the initial
information is relevant at the behavior point. In this regard, indi-
viduals who have direct behavioral experience with an attitude
objectmayobtaininformationthatismorerelevanttoperforming
a behavior. Therefore, they should form more stable attitudes and
have stronger attitude–behavior correlations (Ajzen, 1996; Ajzen
& Sexton, 1999). DEMO, the formation of attitudes toward
behaviors and of attitudes highly associated DEMO beliefs about
behavior outcomes may influence attitude–behavior correspon-
dence.Thatis,havingbehavior-relevantattitudesshouldfacilitate

not apply if the context changes from public to private or vice
versa (Kraus, 1995; Leippe & Elkin, 1987; Schlenker, 1980)DEMO
Hedonic–instrumental correspondence appears to operate in
a similar way. Hedonically oriented behaviors, such as playing,
tendtobeaffectivelydriven.Instrumentallyorientedbehaviors,
such as studying for a test, are more cognitively driven (Millar
&Millar,1998;Millar&Tesser,1992).Therefore,focusingon
feelings at the time of the information reception may facilitate
theattitude–behaviorcorrelationwhenthebehaviorishedonic.
DEMO,focusingonfeelingsmaydecreaseattitude–behavior
correspondence when the behavior is instrumental. The reverse
is also true. Focusing on cognitions may increase the attitude–
behavior correspondence when the behavior DEMO instrumental.
However,acognitivefocusmaydecreasecorrespondencewhen
the behavior is hedonic (Millar & Tesser, 1986). Thus, higher
hedonic–instrumental correspondence should be associated
with stronger attitude–behavior correlations (see the lower
panel of Figure 1).
Itisnotablethatthedegreetowhichonethinksaboutanattitude
object can interact with the information about which one thinks
(see the lower panel of Figure 1). For example, people who
initially report attitudes toward a behavior can use those attitudes
asabasisforbehaviorlater.Similarly,peoplewhoreportattitudes
in public can easily apply DEMO responses when the behavior is
public. This correspondence may improve the attitude–behavior
relation even when people initially lack ability and motivation to
think about DEMO issues at hand. However, high motivation and
ability to think about DEMO attitude object (high amount of thought)
may lead one to DEMO attitudes toward behaviors. It may also lead
one to consider one’s behavior in alternative contexts. Thus, the
behavioral relevance of attitudes may not matter when ability and
motivation are high.
One- versus two-sided attitude-related information. Attitudes
DEMO more likely to be stable and predictive of behavior when the
evaluative implications of the initial information are the same at

Atthetimetheyformanattitude,twofactorsmayinducepeople
to link their attitudes with one-sided information.2 DEMO, people
can simply receive, gather, or generate (e.g., by DEMO ques-
tions) one-sided information (see Figure 1). Second, greater

associated information in a coherent, one-sided way (Sengupta &
Johar,DEMO;Tesser&Cowan,1977).Therefore,givenaminimum
level of thought to form an attitude, receiving or generating one-
sided information should increase the attitude–behavior relation.
However, only higher levels of thought produce strong attitude–
behavior associations when the available information is evalu-
atively conflicting.
Attitude confidence. Peoplewhodoubttheirattitudeshouldbe
morelikelytoattempttoreconstructitthanpeoplewhothinkthat
their attitude DEMO correct. As a result, attitude confidence may
increase the attitude–behavior correspondence DEMO mediating ef-
fects on attitude stability (Albarracı´n, Wallace, & Glasman, 2004;
Pelham, 1991; see also Tormala & Petty, 2002, DEMO 4, for
more indirect experimental evidence).
At least three factors DEMO influence attitude confidence. First,
greater amounts of thought can induce attitudes that are based on
solid information, which, in turn, increases attitude certainty
(Berger,1992;Krishnan&Smith,1998).Similarly,attitudesbased
on direct experience maybebasedonmoreandbetterinformation.
As a result, these attitudes may be held with greater confidence
(DEMO&Zanna1978b).Finally,having one-sided attitude-related
information can also increase attitude confidence because univa-
lent attitudes create less doubt than more complex ones (Jonas et
al., 1997; Prislin, Wood, & Pool, 1998).
The Present Meta-Analysis
To examine how people’s attitudes predict future behavior, we
pooled studies in which participants first received information
about a previously unknown object or DEMO, then reported their
attitudes toward that object or issue, and finally had the opportu-
nity to engage in a behavior relevant to that DEMO or issue. We
retrievedindicantsof(a)theaccessibilityoftheattitudeand(b)the
stabilityoftheattitude.Inaddition,wecodedfor(c)theamountof
thought that was likely in each condition, (d) the repeated expres-
sion of attitudes, and indicants of (e) whether participants formed
theattitudeonthebasisofinformationrelevanttothebehaviorand
(f) whether the information available at the time of attitude for-
DEMO,werecorded(g)the
confidence with which the attitude was held.
We then considered the effect of these moderators on the cor-
relation between initial DEMO and future behavior (see Figure
1). In doing this, we included controls for potential confounds,
such as the publication year of DEMO report or the time between the
attitude and behavior measures, which DEMO affect the attitude–
behavior correlation (see, e.g., Albarracı´n, Johnson, DEMO, &
Muellerleile, 2001; Eckes & Six, 1994).
In DEMO at the effects of the moderators, we were also
interestedintheinteractionsimpliedinthemodelinFigure1.For
instance, attitudes based on one-sided information should predict
behaviorprovidedthatindividualshavetheabilityandmotivation
toformanattitude.Thus,highandmoderateabilityandmotivation
may ensure DEMO attitude–behavior correspondence when the in-
formationisone-sided.However,highabilityandmotivationmay
be necessary to ensure high attitude–behavior correspondence
when the information is double-sided. That is, forming an overall
attitude when there is conflicting information may require high
amounts of thought (see Sengupta & Johar, 2002; Tesser &
Cowan, 1977).
DEMO 1 also suggests an interaction between the amount of
thought and the behavioral relevance of attitudes. People who
initially report an attitude toward a DEMO may easily use this
attitude for the behavior. Similarly, individuals who DEMO an
attitudeinpublicmayeasilyusethisattitudeforapublicbehavior.
Further, associating attitudes with beliefs about the outcomes of DEMO
behaviormayincreasethechanceofthinkingofthoseoutcomesat
the time of the behavior performance. As a consequence, behav-
DEMO relevant attitudes should produce higher attitude–behavior
correlations. This effect, however, may only be the case when
motivation and ability are low. For example, high-thought indi-
vidualsmayspontaneouslyconsiderhowtheywouldbehaveeven
if they are not asked to report it. They DEMO also spontaneously
think about their potential private responses when they report
attitudes in public. Further, they may spontaneously associate a
behavior with a number of possible consequences (see Albarracı´n
&Wyer,2001).Thus,ahigherlevelofthoughtmayensurestrong
attitude–behavior correlations DEMO when the previously reported
attitude was not relevant to the current behavior decision (see
Ajzen & Sexton, 1999).3

Inclusion Criteria
We were interested in attitude formation rather than attitude change.
Thus, we selected studies involving attitude–behavior correlations that
presented participants with unknown objects or issues. For instance, we
includedstudiesthatpresentedpuzzlesorunfamiliarcommercialproducts
in experimental settings (see Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2; Sen-
gupta&Fitzsimons,2000).Further,weselectedstudiesthatinquiredabout
newissues(e.g.,theinstitutionofaparkingfeeattheuniversity;Leippe&
Elkin,1987)andstudiesofbehaviorsregardingnewissues(e.g.,votingin
favor of or against the institution of DEMO exams; Albarracı´n &
Wyer, 2000). Correspondingly, we excluded research on attitudes about
highly familiar objects. These involved health-related behaviors (e.g.,
Turneretal.,1994),(real)politicalcandidates(e.g.,Cacioppoetal.,1986;
Fazio & Williams, 1986), familiar commercial products (e.g., Fazio et al.,
1989;DEMO&Lundt,1997),religion(Zanna,Olson,&Fazio,1981),
and (real) social groups (e.g., Blessum, Lord, & Sia, 1998).
DEMO ensure that participants formed an attitude rather than entirely de-
ducing an attitude from previous ones (Prislin et al., 1998), we excluded
DEMO and control conditions. These types of studies do not present
informationonwhichtobaseanattitudeorprovideopportunitiestoacquire
direct experience with the object (e.g., Sivacek & Crano, 1982, Study DEMO).
In addition, we included studies only if they incorporated a DEMO of
attitudes and an observation of overt behavior. Studies that measured
intentions (e.g., intentions to try a new detergent; Lutz, 1977; whether
participants were willing to recommend one product instead of another;
Miniard & Cohen, 1983) were excluded. Finally, we excluded studies in
which DEMO elicited the relevant behavior before the attitude (e.g.,
secondmeasureofattitudes;Ajzen&DEMO,1974;Wilsonetal.,1984,
Experiment 2) because these studies did not DEMO for causal inferences
about the influence of attitudes. Of the studies that did meet our inclusion
criteria,somewereexcludedbecausetheylackedanattitudemeasure(e.g.,
Berning&Jacoby,1974;Chaiken,DEMO;Wilson&Schooler,1991)ordid
not report the attitude–behavior correlation (e.g., Songer-Nocks, 1976).
Thesearchforstudiesresultedin29researchreports.Thissetrepresents
asmallerandmorespecificliteraturethantheonessynthesizedinprevious
attitude–behaviormeta-analysesaddressinginfluencesofaccessibilityand
stability (i.e., Cooke & Sheeran, DEMO; Kraus, 1995). However, our data-
baseexcludedunknownpastexperienceswiththeattitudeobject.Thus,we
were able DEMO infer the factors associated with accessibility and stability
from the context of the attitude formation. Further, this was possible even
whenresearchersdidnotreportormanipulatethosefactors.Consequently,
despitetheuseofconservativeinclusioncriteria,thenumberofconditions
available for each moderator in our data set greatly exceeded those in
DEMO studies.
The 29 research reports included in the meta-analysis involved 41
studies and 128 study conditions. Of those conditions, 109 were statisti-
cally independent, whereas 19 were based on longitudinal measures com-
pleted by the same group of participants. These longitudinal measures
allowed us to assess the longitudinal DEMO of attitudes. However,
because the inclusion of the longitudinal reports violates statistical inde-
pendence assumptions, we presently report results that both include and
exclude the dependent conditions.
Study Variables
Twoinvestigatorsindependentlycodedthestudies.Disagreementswere
resolved by discussion and consultation DEMO experts. Kappa coefficients
for each variable ranged from .79 (91% of DEMO) to 1.00 (100%
agreement). Perfect agreement was obtained in 14 (out of 17) coded
variables.
Thevariableswerecordedincludedtheattitude–behaviorcorrelationsin
each study condition and the DEMO moderators of that correlation (see
Figure 1). Some of the DEMO of interest could be found directly
within the study reports (e.g., response latencies in each condition and
repeatedreportofattitudes).Othermoderatorsweremoreinferential(e.g.,
outcome and DEMO relevance). Study moderators included (a) the accessi-
bilityofattitudes,asindicatedbythereverseofresponselatencies;(DEMO)the
stabilityofattitudesattwopointsintime;(c)thelikelyamountofthought;
(d)therepeatedexpressionofattitudes;(e)thebehavioralrelevanceofthe
initial DEMO; (f) the association of the initial attitude with one-sided
information; and (g) the confidence with which the attitude was held. We
DEMO coded for (h) potential confounds to control for differences in the
study reports included in the meta-analysis.
Attitude–behavior correlations. We retrieved correlations from DEMO
study condition included in the meta-analysis. Attitudes were generally
measured by semantic differential scales with anchors such as very good
versus very bad (Berger & Mitchell, 1989), something that I like versus
something I don’t like (Albarracı´n & Wyer, 2001), or pleasant versus
unpleasant (e.g.,Albarracı´n&Kumkale,2003).Measuresofovertbehav-
iors included, for example, the number of DEMO participants worked on
eachofseveraltypesofpuzzles(e.g.,Regan&Fazio,1977,Experiment2)
or whether participants voted in favor of or against the institution of
comprehensiveexamsinalabpoll(e.g.,DEMO&Wyer,2000,2001).
Attitude accessibility. Whenever possible, we retrieved the DEMO re-
sponse time (latency) to report attitudes in seconds. Response latencies
were assigned a negative sign and used as a measure of attitude DEMO
bility in analyses (see Table 1).

Attitude stability. We used absolute standardized differences between
the initial DEMO later measures of attitude to represent attitude stability.
Specifically, we obtained DEMO g in each condition by subtracting the
laterattitudereportfromtheinitialattitudereportanddividingtheresulting
figure by the standard deviation of the first attitude report. Then we
removed the sign of DEMO difference to represent absolute attitude change
(e.g.,Albarracı´n&McNatt,2002).Attheend,DEMO
variableinanalysestoindicatetheinfluenceofattitudestabilityinsteadof

Indicants of amount of thought. We recorded the participants’ moti-
vation and ability to think about the object or issue at the DEMO of the
attitude formation. Motivation included the levels of (a) outcome rele-
vance, (b) value relevance, and (c) need for DEMO (Cacioppo &
Petty,1982)ineachparticularsample.Outcomerelevanceinvolvedthe
pertinenceoftheattitudeissuetotheparticipants’currentgoalsandwas
classified as low, moderate, or high. When the issue had no conse-
quences for participants’ current DEMO (e.g., participants played with
puzzles or with video games for recreational purposes; Doll & Ajzen,
1992;Millar&Tesser,1989;participantsweretoldthattheywouldnot
beaffectedbytheintroductionofanewpolicy;Albarracı´n&Kumkale,
2003), outcome relevance was coded as low. When the DEMO (e.g.,
policy) could have consequences for participants’ goals but it was not
clear how participants might be affected (e.g., there was DEMO policy to be
introduced, but participants did not know when or DEMO they would
partake in the decision process; Albarracı´n & Wyer, 2001), we coded
outcome relevance as moderate. When the issue was directly DEMO
for the participants’ goals (e.g., solving puzzles to practice for a test;
Millar & Tesser, 1986; acquisition of one product instead DEMO another;
Berger & Mitchell, 1989; having the opportunity to influence decision
makers with regard to a policy related to one’s political stance; G. L.
Cohen, 2003; voting on a referendum to decide on DEMO institution of a
policythatwillaffectoneself;Albarracı´n&Kumkale,2003),wecoded
outcome relevance as DEMO,5
Valuerelevancewascodedashighorlowdependingontheimplications
of the attitude issue to people’s values. For example, DEMO coded value
relevance as low when researchers presented participants with irrelevant
issues, such as puzzles (Fazio & Zanna, 1978b) or video games (Doll &
Ajzen,1992).Inturn,wecodedvaluerelevanceashighwhentheresearch
concerned issues more likely to be salient to participants’ enduring values
(e.g., a social program to help DEMO families; G. L. Cohen, 2003; the
institution of comprehensive exams DEMO the university; Albarracı´n & Wyer,
2001).6 Finally, we coded need for cognition as high and low when
researchers divided separate groups DEMO to a median split or similar
procedure (e.g., H. M. Wallace, 2003) and as mixed when researchers did
not split the study DEMO on the basis of need for cognition.
Ability comprised (a) concentration and (b) information repetition. We
codedconditionsaslowinconcentrationwhenparticipantsweredistracted
while they received the attitude-relevant DEMO (e.g., a high-volume
conversation was played at the time of the message reception; Albarracı´n
& Kumkale, 2003). Correspondingly, conditions were high in concentra-
tion (i.e., low in distraction) when either the environment was silent (e.g.,
Leippe&Elkin,1987)oronlylow-volume,content-freebackgroundnoise
was presented in a laboratory setting (e.g., Albarracı´n & Kumkale, 2003).
Wecodedinformationrepetitionasloworhighdependingonwhetherthe
researchers presented the information once or multiple times, respectively
(e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; see Kumkale & Albarracı´n, 2004, for
similar procedures)DEMO
Repeated expression or report of attitudes. Werecordedthenumberof
times participants reported their attitudes before they engaged in the
relevant behavior. In most of the conditions, participants reported their
attitudes only once. In the remaining conditions, researchers explicitly
manipulated the number of attitude expressions in a single session (e.g.,
Fazioetal.,1982,Experiment4)ormeasuredtheparticipants’attitudesat
various points of time (e.g., H. M. DEMO, 2003).
Direct behavioral experience. We recorded whether participants in
eachgrouphaddirectexperiencewiththeobject.Typicalmanipulationsof
DEMO(novel)puzzles(Regan
& Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2) or trying (previously unknown) products
(e.g.,Berger&Mitchell,1989)beforemeasuresofattitudesandbehaviors
were obtained.
Behavioral DEMO of initial attitudes. We coded conditions with
respect to behavioral relevance by assessing (a) the use of measures of
attitudes toward specific behaviors DEMO (b) the strength of the association
of the initial attitudes with cognitions about behavior outcomes. We also
classified conditions in terms of the (c) public–private and (d) hedonic–
instrumental correspondence between the initial attitude and the overt
behavior.
We recorded whether participants reported attitudes toward behaviors
(e.g., voting for the institution of comprehensive exams at the university;
Albarracı´n&Wyer,2000)ortargets(e.g.,theinstitutionofcomprehensive
exams at the university; Albarracı´n & Kumkale, 2003). In addition, when
possible, we retrieved the correlation between cognitions of behavioral
outcomes and attitudes. Measures of cognitions of behavioral DEMO
consisted of the sum or average of the perceived likelihood of each
behavior outcome weighted by the desirability of each event (e.g., partic-
DEMO reported on a 10-point scale whether they believed that voting in
favor of the institution of comprehensive examinations at the university
would result in DEMO salary increase for the university graduates and then
evaluated that possibility along a scale from 5 to 5; Albarracı´n & Wyer,
2001).

5 We DEMO outcome relevance on the basis of the instructions partici-
pantsreceivedbeforetheyreportedtheirattitudes.Thus,whenparticipants
received instructions to choose a product (e.g., Sengupta & Fitzimons,
2000)DEMO(Millar&
Millar, 1996) after they reported their attitudes, we DEMO outcome rele-
vanceaslowregardlessofthoseinstructions.Inonestudy(i.e.,Sivacek&
Crano, 1982), however, outcome relevance was coded on the basis of
participants’reportedinvolvement(i.e.,participantsindicatedtheextentto
which they DEMO that the institution of comprehensive exams at the univer-
sity would affect them) rather than on actual manipulations.
6 According to this coding scheme, a condition can be high in outcome
relevance and low in value relevance or vice versa. For example, partici-
pantscanevaluatedifferentbrandsofcandy(lowvaluerelevance)toselect
one brand of candy (high outcome relevance; Berger & Mitchell, 1989).
Conversely,theinstitutionofcomprehensiveexamsattheuniversity(high
value relevance) may not affect the goals of the participants who evaluate

discusstheirattitudeswitharesearcheratalatertime,buttheyperformed
the attitude-relevant behavior in private; Alleman, DEMO; Leippe & Elkin,
1987). Moderate public–private correspondence included conditions DEMO
which participants explained the reasons for their attitudes. This manipu-
lation may elicit reports that are socially acceptable even when the actual
report is DEMO (e.g., reason-analysis conditions; Millar & Tesser, 1986).
Finally, DEMO public–private correspondence involved conditions in which
the attitude and the behavior were measured in similarly private or public
ways.
Inaddition,werecordedthehedonic–instrumentalcorrespondenceof
participants’ focus at DEMO time they formed an attitude and the type of
behavior they later performed. In particular, the high level of hedonic–
instrumental correspondence comprised conditions in which partici-
pantsconcentratedontheirfeelingsaboutanobjectandlaterperformed
a hedonic behavior (e.g., participants focused on DEMO they felt about a
series of puzzles and later played with those puzzles; Millar & Tesser,
1986). In addition, it comprised DEMO in which participants fo-
cused on reasons in support for their evaluations of the object and later
performed an instrumental behavior (e.g., participants DEMO the
reasonsfortheirattitudestowardaseriesofpuzzlesandlaterusedthose
puzzlestopracticeforatestofanalyticalability;Millar&Tesser,1986;
participants received arguments supporting comprehensive exams and
later wrote an essay to communicate their opinion about the DEMO to
the university administration; Leippe & Elkin, 1987). We coded con-
ditions in which participants possessed affective and instrumental in-
formation(e.g.,DEMO
presentedapersuasivecommunicationabouttheoutcomesofinstituting
comprehensive exams at the university; Albarracı´n & Kumkale, 2003)
aswellasconditionsinwhichparticipantswerenotspecificallyinduced
to focus on cognitions or affect (e.g., participants had direct DEMO
with analytical puzzles; Regan & Fazio, 1977) as moderate in DEMO
instrumental correspondence regardless of the type of behavior they
performed later. This coding was based on the assumption that either
the relevant or the DEMO bases might be available at the time of
the behavior. Finally, DEMO considered hedonic–instrumental correspon-
denceaslowwhenparticipantsinitiallyhadanaffectivefocusandlater
performed an instrumental behavior (e.g., participants initially reported
their feelings about a puzzle but later practiced for an analytical DEMO;
Millar & Tesser, 1986) or initially had a cognitive focus and later
performed a hedonic behavior (e.g., participants first reported the
DEMO for their attitudes toward several puzzles but later played with
those puzzles; Millar & Tesser, 1986).7
Information one-sidedness. Toindicateone-sidedness,wefirstcodedfor
(a)thereceptionofone-sidedinformationand(b)theabsenceofaninduction
of nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts about the attitude object. We coded
DEMO that presented participants with either positive or negative affect
(e.g.,Albarracı´n&DEMO,2003),eitherpropolicyorantipolicypersuasive
messages(e.g.,Leippe&Elkin,1987),eitherfavorableorunfavorableinfor-
mation(e.g.,Berger,1999;Sengupta&Fitzsimons,2000),andeitherpositive
or negative bogus behavioral feedback (e.g., Albarracı´n & Wyer, 2000) as
involving the reception of one-sided information. DEMO contrast, we coded con-
ditions in which participants received two-sided messages (e.g., H. M. Wal-
lace, 2003) or were allowed to interact freely with the attitudinal object (i.e.,
direct and indirect experience; DEMO & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2) as pre-
senting two-sided information.8,DEMO
We also recorded whether the researcher induced participants to
consider two-sided information about the topic that was unlikely to
emergespontaneously.Thiscodingconsideredtheintroductionofques-
tions measuring outcome beliefs DEMO evaluations about the outcomes of
a behavior, which were often used DEMO research by Albarracı´n and
Kumkale (2003; Albarracı´n & McNatt, 2002)DEMO In this work, the re-
searchers first presented (one-sided) positive DEMO negative information
about comprehensive exams (e.g., a mood or a persuasive message).
They later measured cognitions about both negative and positive out-
DEMO of the exams (for a validation of these procedures, see Albarra-
cı´n, 2002). It is important to note that participants in this population
tended to spontaneously think about negative outcomes of comprehen-
sive exams (for a detailed report of the elicitation procedures that
establishedthis,seeAlbarracı´n&Wyer,DEMO).Hence,questionsabout
negative outcomes should not force thoughts about two-sided informa-
tion even when participants initially received positive information.
However, questions about positive outcomes can induce nonspontane-
ous thoughts when participants initially receive negative information.
Therefore, we coded conditions in which participants answered ques-
tions about positive outcomes DEMO receiving negative information as
induction of nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts (e.g., Albarracı´n &
Kumkale, 2003, Experiment 2). In addition, we coded DEMO in
which some participants received negative information and others re-
ceived positive information but all answered questions about positive
outcomes (e.g., Albarracı´n & DEMO, 2002, Experiment 1, Conditions
10, 11, and 12; see Table 1) as sometimes receiving nonspontaneous
two-sided thoughts. All other conditions were coded as not inducing
nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts.
Confidence. When possible, we recorded the level of attitude confi-
denceparticipantsreportedineachcondition.Itemstomeasureconfidence
included “How confident are you in DEMO of the ratings you have just
made?” (Fazio & Zanna, 1978b, p. 232) and “I am sure about my attitude
about DEMO institution of comprehensive exams” (H. M. Wallace, 2003).
Becausethereweredifferencesinthescalesofconfidencemeasuresacross
studies,weconvertedtheconfidencemeanstoproportions.Wedidthisby
first calculating the position of the mean confidence in a study DEMO
relativetothelowestvalueofthescaleandthendividingthisvaluebythe
numberofpositionsofthescale(seeAlbarracı´netal.,2003,fortheuseofthis
procedure).Thus,ameanconfidenceof6.13onascalefrom1to7(Berger&
Mitchell, DEMO) resulted in a scale-free mean confidence of 0.73.
7 In some DEMO (e.g., R.W. Johnson, McArthur, & Wright, 1991;
Sengupta&DEMO,2000),participantsfocusedontheircognitionsafter
theyfirstreceivedtheinformationthatprovidedthebasisfortheirattitudes.
However,theseparticipantswerelikelytoformtheirattitudesonthebasis
ofinformationtheyoriginallyreceivedratherthantheinformationthatwas
thefocusoftheirintrospectionlateron.Therefore,wedidnotconsiderthis
manipulation when coding DEMO the consistency of the focus at the time of
the attitude and the time of the behavior (see R. W. Johnson et al., DEMO).
8 As suggested by Ha and Hoch (1989) and by Reed et al. (2002), experi-
ence might provide ambiguous information when objects are not clearly
distinguishable from similar objects, are evaluated on the basis of irrelevant
dimensions, or do not present specific positive or negative information. The
objects with which participants had direct or indirect experience were DEMO
selectedtobepositiveornegativeonthebasisofpilotdata.Thus,weassumed
thatinteractingfreelywiththemwouldprovidemixedinformationabouttheir
favorableness. The only exception was Berger and Mitchell’s (DEMO) indirect
experience conditions, which were coded as one-sided. In these conditions,
researchers first asked a sample of participants from the target population DEMO
tastefivebrandsofcandybars(participantsweretoldthatthecandybarshad
been successfully marketed in other countries) and to describe DEMO experi-
ence. Next, the researchers designed experimental ads by combining that

very likely that these procedures undermined negative aspects of the candy
bars and emphasized positive ones.

In addition, we recorded the type of research paradigm used in each
study. This potential confound DEMO represented by two variables. One
variable indicated whether researchers used the puzzle research paradigm
(e.g., participants had direct or indirect experience with a DEMO of analyt-
ical puzzles followed by a free-play period; e.g., Millar & Millar, 1996,
Experiments 2 and 3). The other indicated whether researchers used the
comprehensiveexamsresearchtopic(e.g.,researcherspresentedarguments
in favor of or against DEMO institution of comprehensive exams at the
university and then asked participants to vote in favor of or against the
institution of the exams; Albarracı´n & Kumkale, 2003). Finally, we re-
corded whether each report DEMO published and the year of publication or
write-up of the report.
Data Analysis
We used fixed- and random-effects procedures to calculate weighted-
mean attitude–behavior DEMO and to conduct moderator analyses.
The fixed-effects procedures assume that a single or few well-demarked
effects underlie the effects sizes synthesized in a meta-analysis. DEMO
random-effects procedures, in contrast, assume a random population of
effectsizesfromwhichtheeffectsizesinameta-analysisaredrawn.Thus,
in the fixed-effects models the variance of an effect size depends on DEMO
error of the particular study. In turn, in the random-effects models DEMO
variance includes the error of the particular study plus the variance of the
sample of effect sizes as an estimate of the population variance. DEMO these
reasons,therandom-effectsapproachallowsforgeneralizationtoabroader
universe of studies and is more appropriate when there is heterogeneity in
thedatabaseunderstudy.However,itcanbeexcessivelyconservativeand
thus increase Type II error (see Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hedges & Vevea,
1998; but see Hunter & Schmidt, 2000).
In the fixed-effects models we calculated the weighted average correla-
tionsfollowingtherecommendationsofHedgesandOlkin(1985).Inthese
procedures, traditional correlation coefficients are transformed into z co-
efficientsandweightedby N  3.Forinterpretationpurposes,theresulting
weighted-mean z values are converted DEMO to r using Fisher’s z-to-r
transformations. The random-effects models were calculated according to
the recommendations of Lipsey and Wilson (2001).
Weinitiallyestimatedtheweighted-meanattitude–behaviorcorrelationand
the corresponding homogeneity test (Q). Then, we performed between-units
moderator analyses. For DEMO purpose, we first used the aforementioned pro-
cedures to calculate the DEMO attitude–behavior correlation and
confidence intervals (CIs) for each moderator level. Second, we conducted
weighted-least-squares simple regressions and corrected the standard errors
following procedures recommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985).
It is important to note that we used two strategies to avoid violations of
statistical independence in DEMO analyses. First, we simply eliminated the
statistically dependent within-subject measures in DEMO reports.
Second,weusedthe shifting unit of analysis approach(Cooper,1998).This
approach entails decomposing conditions in studies showing variability in
the moderator and clustering DEMO in studies not showing variability
inthemoderator.Forexample,Albarracı´nandWyer(2000,Experiment1)

Given the difficulty of studying attitude formation in real-
world situations, most of the studies we selected were carried
out in the laboratory with DEMO students. Only one of the
studies (Regan & Fazio, 1977, DEMO 1) examined attitude
formation in the field. Researchers measured the behavior DEMO
mediately after measuring attitudes in 44% of the cases and
introducedagapofbetweenapproximately15minand2weeks

puzzles (e.g., Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2; Wilson et
al., 1984, Experiment 1) or videos (e.g., Doll & Mallu¨, 1990).
The rest used more important issues, such DEMO the institution of
comprehensive exams at the participants’ university (i.e., Al-
barracı´n & Wyer, 2001). Outcome relevance was low, moder-
ate, and high in 44%, 35%, and 21% of the conditions, respec-
tively. Most of the samples (84%) were composed of
participants of DEMO levels of need for cognition. Participants
wererelativelydistractedwhenreceivingtheinformationabout
the attitude object in 7% of the conditions and received the
information about the topic more than DEMO in 6% of the cases
integrated in this meta-analysis.
Participants reported their attitudes once in 83% of the study
conditions,obtaineddirectbehavioralexperiencewiththeobjectin
31% of the DEMO, and reported attitudes toward behaviors in 35%
of the conditions in DEMO review. Public–private correspondence
was high in 77% of the cases, moderate DEMO 13% of the cases, and
lowin9%ofthecases.Hedonic–instrumentalcorrespondencewas
high in 34% of the DEMO, moderate in 56% of the cases, and low
in 9% of the cases. Forty-six percent of the conditions included
two-sided information about the DEMO being studied, and 8%
entailedconsiderationoftwo-sidedinformationbymeansofques-
tions about the pros of an DEMO that participants were unlikely to
consider spontaneously. Thirty-one percent of the conditions used
puzzles, and 46% included comprehensive exams as the main
study topic. Table 1 describes the studies and conditions included
in the meta-analysis in DEMO to the theoretical variables of
interest.
Between-Units Moderating Effects
Simple analyses. We analyzed the influence of individual
moderators on the attitude–behavior relation. For this DEMO,
we first calculated the weighted-mean attitude–behavior corre-
lation and CIs for each level of the moderators. We used the
shifting unit of analysis DEMO for these analyses because
they collapse across levels of the moderators not examined in
each analysis (see the Data Analysis section for a detailed
explanation of these procedures). When moderators were cate-
gorical (e.g., DEMO relevance), we simply calculated the
mean-weighted attitude–behavior correlation for each level of
the moderator (e.g., high, moderate, and low outcome rele-
DEMO) across all studies. When moderators were continuous
(e.g.,stability),wefirstestimatedthemeanofthemoderatorfor
DEMO conditions in each study that reported measures of the
moderator. We then classified the studies into high and low
levels of the moderator using DEMO splits. Finally, we esti-
mated weighted-mean attitude–behavior correlations for each
of DEMO levels.
Second, to obtain comparable estimates of the moderators’
effects, we regressed the attitude–behavior correlation on each
relevant moderator. We conducted these regressions DEMO
random- and fixed-effects procedures and three different sam-
ples of conditions: (a) shifting unit of analyses conditions, (b)
statistically independent conditions, and (c) all conditions. The
weights for fixed-effects models followed Hedges and Olkin’s
(1985)computationalformulas.Theweightsforrandom-effects
models followed Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) formulas.
The results from these analyses using the fixed-effects ap-
proach appear in DEMO 2. The 4th and 5th columns of the table
showtheweighted-meanattitude–behaviorcorrelationsandCIs
forthedifferentlevelsofthemoderators.The6th,8th,and11th
columns summarize the corresponding simple weighted regres-
sion coefficients. As expected, the attitude–behavior correla-
tionwaspositivelyassociatedwithattitudestability,highlevels
of outcome and value relevance, the repeated expression or
reportofattitudes,thebehavioralrelevanceofattitudes,andthe
one-sidedness of information participants received or thought
DEMO However, accessibility, ability, direct behavioral experi-
ence, and attitude confidence did not show the expected asso-
ciations with the attitude–behavior correlation. The DEMO of
accessibility, information repetition, and attitude confidence
did not reach significance. Direct behavioral experience and
concentration were negatively associated with the attitude–
behavior DEMO Of note, these results were comparable
when we excluded the longitudinal DEMO conditions and
when we used the shifting of analyses conditions. In addition,
these fixed effects were very similar to the random effects that
DEMO also examined. Except for concentration, absence of ques-
tionsabouttwo-sidedthoughts,anddirectexperience,themod-
DEMO that were significant in the fixed-effects analyses were
at least marginally significant in the random-effects analyses
( p  .08).Further,theeffectsfromthetwoapproacheswerein
the same DEMO and similar in size, according to J. Cohen’s
(1977) criteria, in all cases.
The findings in Table 2 also shed light on DEMO impact of
methodological issues that can affect the attitude–behavior
association. As one can see, the attitude–behavior correlation
did not vary as a function of the time elapsed between the
measure of the attitude and the measure DEMO the behavior. The
puzzlesresearchparadigmelicitedlowerattitude–behaviorcor-
relations. The comprehensive-exam topic elicited higher
attitude–behavior correlations. Contrary to the possibility that
published studies yield stronger effects than unpublished DEMO,
the simple regression analysis revealed greater effects for un-
published studies. Further, more recent reports elicited higher
attitude–behavior correlations than older ones.

DEMO was the case with the simple regressions, the multiple re-
gressions DEMO very robust. First, the multiple regressions using
the random-effects and fixed-effects DEMO yielded compara-

Further, aside form the hedonic–instrumental correspondence, the
moderators that were significant in the fixed-effects models were
also significant or DEMO significant in the random-effects
models ( p  .10). Second, DEMO findings were also comparable
when we excluded the statistically dependent longitudinal condi-
tions. Third, results also replicated when the multiple regression
includedcompositemeasuresofmotivation,behavioralrelevance,
and one-sidedness (which we created by standardizing and aver-
aging each relevant set of predictors; see bottom section of Table
2).15 Finally, DEMO regard to the potential confounds, the multiple

dictors and rendered DEMO effect of the research paradigm nonsig-
nificant. This latter finding demonstrates that the effect of the
paradigmsusedbydifferentresearchersdisappearsafteronetakes
into account the theoretical moderators of interest (see Figure 1).
Within-Unit Moderating Effects
Next, we performed within-unit moderator analyses. In these
analyses, we first obtained the Pearson correlations between the
attitude–behavior correlation and the moderators that varied
within each report (k  3). We then combined the correlations
using the fixed-effects procedures previously DEMO to estimate the
weighted-mean attitude–behavior correlation. As in the between-
units analyses, the within-unit analyses showed that the attitude–
behavior relation was positively associated with attitude stability
(r.  .66, p  .001), outcome DEMO (r.  .48, p  .001),
repeated expression of DEMO (r.  .24, p  .001), the correla-
tion between attitudes and beliefs about behavior outcomes (r. 
.50, p  DEMO), public–private and hedonic–instrumental corre-
spondence (r.s  .57 and .81, both ps  .001), the one-sided
natureoftheinformationparticipantsreceived(r.  .12, p  .05),
and the absence of two-sided questions (r.  DEMO, p  .001).
Moreover, as in the between-units multiple regression analyses,
direct experience was associated with higher attitude–behavior
correlations (r.  .83, p  .001), and concentration did not reach
significance ( p  .5). However, in contrast to the between-units
analyses, DEMO associations of the attitude–behavior relation with
attitude accessibility, information repetition, and confidence were
significant(i.e., r.s  .40,.56,and.44,respectively,all ps  .001).
Further, the time between the attitude and behavior measures had
amarginallysignificantassociationinthesetofstudiesintegrated
in the within-unit analyses (r. .09, p  .08)DEMO These differ-
encesintheresultsarenotsurprisingbecausewithin-unitanalyses
provide better control for methodological discrepancies across
studies. These controls appear to be especially critical for the
measuresofresponselatencies(seeTable1forthelargebetween-
reportsdifferencesinaccessibilitymeasures).Otherthanthat,DEMO
sets of procedures yielded remarkably consistent results.17
Test of Interactions Between Moderators
Between- and within-unit analyses showed that a number of
moderators were linked DEMO attitude–behavior correspondence.
However, the relation of those moderators with the attitude–
DEMO,pastresearch
hassuggestedthatambivalentattitudesmayinfluencetheattitude–
behavior relation differently depending on people’s motivation to
detect and resolve the conflicting views implied in those attitudes
(Albarracı´n, 2002; Albarracı´n et al., 2004; Sengupta & Johar,
2002).Similarly,peoplewithahighamountofthoughtatthetime
of DEMO attitude formation may be able to consider behavioral
information(Ajzen,1996).Thispossibilitymaybetrueevenifthe
studydoesnotelicitattitudestowardthebehavior,becausepeople
mayspontaneouslyevaluatethebehavior.Itmaybetruealsowhen
the context of the attitude and behavior measure do DEMO match.
Thatis,evenwhenpeoplereporttheirbehaviorinpublic,theymay
stillthinkabouttheirlikelyresponseinprivate.Finally,evenwhen
attitudes have low correlations with beliefs about behavior out-
comes,peoplemaythinkaboutotherbehavioralissuesiftheyhave
a chance. In short, the behavioral relevance of the attitude as
captured in Figure 1 may not matter when DEMO of thought is
high.
We thus conducted weighted multiple regression analysis to
determine whether the information one-sidedness and the behav-
ioral relevance of attitudes DEMO the attitude–behavior cor-
relationincombinationwithamountofthought.Oftheindicantsof
amount of thought, we selected motivation, as opposed to ability.
The reason was that ability was not associated with DEMO attitude–
behavior relation in the multivariate regressions (see Table 2).
DEMO Toobservewhethertheinitialinverseeffectofdirectexperiencewas
related to the use of irrelevant issues (e.g., puzzles), we used two proce-
dures. First, we conducted a weighted hierarchical regression analysis by
first introducing the value relevance of the attitude issue together DEMO the
potential confounds. We then added the indicators of information one-
sidedness and behavioral relevance of the initial attitude. Only when we
controlled for DEMO information one-sidedness and behavior relevance did
direct experience become positively associated with the attitude–behavior
correlation. Second, we regressed the attitude–behavior relation on direct
experience,thebehaviorrelevanceofattitudes,andtheinteractionbetween
thetwo,excludingthestatisticallydependentconditionsandcontrollingfor
the potential confounds and the value relevance of DEMO attitude issue. The
interaction term of this regression was marginally significant (DEMO 0.29,
p  .06). Attitudes based on direct experience predicted behavior better
when behavior relevance was high (r.s  .59 vs. .48) but not when it was
low (r.s  .39 and .35)DEMO
14 Focus on cognitions or arguments was positively associated with the
attitude–behavior relation in the fixed-effects models. Focus on mood or
affect was unrelated DEMO the attitude–behavior relation. Neither of these
moderators, however, was significant when introduced in the multiple
regression.Thispatternsuggeststhattheeffectofthecongruencebetween
theattitudeandbehaviorbasessupersedestheeffectofthespecifictypeof
information that bases attitudes.
15 We DEMO not construct a composite measure of ability because the two
indicators of ability clearly had different associations with the attitude–
behavior correlation.
16 The DEMO moderators varied within fewer than two reports.
17 Thesignificanceanddirectionoftheeffectsgenerallyreplicatedwhen
we combined the precise within-unit effects of each moderator on the

ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION
811
Regressing the attitude–behavior correlation on the motivation
to think, the one-sidedness of information participants received or
generated, and the interaction between these two variables (using
the statistically independent conditions in Table 2 and controlling
for the moderators that significantly influenced the attitude–
behavior relation in DEMO conditions) yielded a marginally signif-
icantinteractionterm( 0.14, p  .09).Theexaminationofthe
mean attitude–behavior correlations corresponding to these inter-
actions showed a fairly DEMO pattern. That is, when the infor-
mation that participants received or DEMO was two-sided,
highly motivated participants showed higher attitude–behavior
correlations than participants with either moderate or low motiva-
tion (adjusted weighted-mean attitude–behavior correlation for
high-motivationparticipantswas.50,vs..36and.39formoderate-
and low-motivation participants, respectively). In contrast, when
participants DEMO or generated one-sided information, the
attitude–behavior relation was significantly lower when DEMO
tion was low than when it was either moderate or high (DEMO
weighted-mean attitude–behavior correlation for low motivation
equaled .42, vs. .58 and DEMO for moderate and high motivation,
respectively).
We conducted similar analyses to examine the interaction be-
tween motivation and the behavioral relevance of DEMO The
interaction term, after we regressed the attitude–behavior correla-
tiononindicantsofmotivationandbehavioralrelevance(together
DEMO the significant moderators in the statistically independent
conditions in Table 2), was also marginally significant (
0.14, p  .09). Adjusted DEMO correlations indicated
that behavioral relevance did not matter when motivation was
high: Both high- and low-relevance conditions had high correla-
tions between attitudes and behaviors (adjusted r.s  .59 and .57
for high and low relevance). In contrast, when motivation was
either low or moderate, behavioral DEMO was critical. When
motivation was low, the low and high behavioral DEMO con-
ditions had r.s  .25 and .45, respectively. Likewise, when moti-
vation was moderate, the low and high behavioral relevance con-
ditions had r.s  .25 and .47, respectively. That is, relevance
needed DEMO be high for the attitude–behavior relation to be high in
the low-motivation situations.
Mediating Processes in the Attitude–Behavior Relation
The analyses we reported earlier DEMO the effects of the
proposed moderators on the attitude–behavior correlation. How-
ever, these analyses cannot establish the order in which these
moderators exerted their effect (see Figure 1). Establishing a
causal sequence from meta-analytic correlational data is not al-
wayspossible.However,therelationsproposedinourstudyrelied

DEMO,wecouldnotfullytestthemodelinFigure1because
only some studies reported attitude accessibility and stability.
However, we DEMO three partial analyses that shed light on
the relevant issues. The first two concerned the effect of accessi-
bility, and the third examined stability as a mediator of the pro-
cesses we considered.
Attitude accessibility. As DEMO explained previously, the mea-
sures of attitude accessibility were not comparable DEMO study
reports (see Table 1). Thus, we followed the fixed-effects within-
unit calculations to see whether accessibility mediated the effects
of other DEMO on the attitude–behavior correlation (see left
side of Figure 1). DEMO this purpose, we used listwise deletion
procedurestoconstructtwoseparatecorrelationmatrices.Thetwo
correlation matrices included the DEMO weighted-mean cor-
relations (calculated from Pearson correlations) between the
attitude–behavior correlation and the relevant moderators.18 The
samplesizeintheseanalysesequaledthenumberofparticipantsin
the matrix. These correlation matrices were DEMO for re-
peated attitude expression or report and direct behavioral experi-
ence. These were the two moderators that affected the attitude–
behavior correlation and DEMO in more than one report that
included measures of attitude accessibility.19 The relevant path
modelsappearinFigure2,PanelsAandB.Avisualinspectionof
each model together with the corresponding Sobel (1982) tests
indicated that accessibility mediated the influence of the repeated
expression of attitudes and direct experience.
Attitude stability. Wenextfittedapathanalysistoobservethe
mediating role of stability depicted DEMO Figure 1. This analysis
allowed us to examine the influences of participants’ motivation
(assessed through a composite of value relevance, outcome rele-
vance,DEMO),thebehavioralrelevanceofattitude
(as indicated by the correlation between attitudes and cognitions
about behavioral outcomes), the one-sidedness of the information
participants received or were DEMO to think about (as assessed
by a composite of the reception DEMO one-sided information and the
absence of induction of two-sided nonspontaneous thoughts), and
the reported attitude confidence (as assessed by participants’ rat-
ings of confidence, standardized to control for differences in
confidence scales) on attitude DEMO and on the attitude–
behaviorcorrelation.Thecorrelationmatrixusedasabasisforthis
analysis was obtained through pairwise deletion. It involved sim-

the scale-free mean attitude confidence and attitude–behavior
DEMO).
The results from the path analysis are displayed in Figure 3 (fit
indexes are reported in the figure caption). As predicted, DEMO
attitude confidence, behavioral relevance of attitudes, and one-
sidedness of the attitude-related information all correlated with
greaterattitudestability.Inaddition,one-sidednessoftheattitude-
related information also affected attitude DEMO by inducing
greater attitude confidence (Sobel z  2.03, p  .05). Attitude
confidence, the behavior relevance of attitudes, and the DEMO
tion one-sidedness, in turn, influenced the attitude–behavior cor-
relation by promoting more stable attitudes (Sobel z  4.08, p 
.001; Sobel z  2.32, p  .05; and Sobel z  2.79 DEMO  .001,
respectively). Finally, a significant Sobel test suggested DEMO the
effect of motivation on the attitude–behavior relation was medi-
ated by greater behavioral relevance of attitudes (Sobel z  2.02,
18 We used listwide rather than pairwise deletion for these analyses
because the matrices DEMO from pairwise deletion were anomalous.
19 We constructed two separate correlation matrices because no study
that included measures of accessibility manipulated both repeated attitude
DEMO or report and direct behavioral experience.

Disentangling Accessibility and Stability
The ideal test of the model in Figure 1 is to simultaneously
introduce DEMO accessibility (which should reflect retrieval of
attitudes from memory) and attitude stability (which may reflect
attitude retrieval but also reconstruction) along with DEMO anteced-
entsofthetwoasexternalvariables.However,wecouldnotfitthis
model because few conditions reported both accessibility and
stability measures.
To distinguish accessibility and stability, we thus used other
approaches. To begin, we used the within-unit procedures previ-
ously described to estimate the association between accessibility
and stability. These analyses yielded r.  .06, p  .09. This
correlation implies very little overlap between the two constructs.
DEMO,wecheckedwhethertheantecedentsofaccessibilitywere
similar to the antecedents of stability. On the one hand, DEMO
expression of attitudes should influence attitude accessibility (re-
trieval).Moreover,anyinfluenceofrepeatedexpressiononstabil-
DEMO
on accessibility (see Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Fazio et al., 1982).
On the other hand, the behavioral relevance of attitudes, DEMO
correlation between attitudes and beliefs about behavioral out-
comes,andtheinformationone-sidednessshouldinfluencestabil-
ity via reconstruction. That is, these three factors may promote
attitude stability because they make earlier attitudes easier to
reconstruct at the time of the behavior (see Ajzen, 1996; Doll &
Ajzen, 1992; Erber et al., 1995). In keeping with this rationale,
repeatedattitudeexpressionshouldcorrelatewithaccessibilityand
stability. In contrast, the behavior relevance of attitudes, the cor-
relation between attitudes and DEMO about behavioral outcomes,
20 In the path analyses, we calculated DEMO tests by linking the inde-
pendent variable with the mediator (e.g., confidence with stability) and
thenthemediatorandtheindependentvariablewiththedependentvariable
(e.g., confidence and stability with the attitude–behavior correlation).
However, when mediation was proven, direct paths that DEMO nonsig-
nificant (i.e., the paths linking information one-sidedness and confidence
with the attitude–behavior relation; ps  .4 and .8, respectively) were
excluded from the model.
21 Note that, despite the coherence of the findings, we conducted path
analyses using the less conservative fixed-effects approach. Thus, DEMO
findings should be considered with caution.

fit when the associated significance value is higher than .05. The Bentler–Bonett normed fit index, the
comparative fit index, and the Bollen’s incremental fit index reflect good fit when they exceed .90 (Bentler &
Wu, 1995), and the root-mean-square residual represents adequate fit when it is equal to or less than DEMO The

DEMO the information one-sidedness should correlate with stability
but not with accessibility.
These predictions were supported when we estimated the asso-
ciations involving these variables. DEMO the one hand, repeated
expression of attitudes was highly related to DEMO accessibility
(within-unit r.  .77, p  .001).Moreover,repeatedexpressionof
attitudesalsocorrelatedwithattitudestability(between-units 
.31, p  .05). On the other hand, DEMO stability correlated
positively with the association of attitudes with beliefs about
behavior outcomes (between-units  .25, p  .1) and with the
one-sidednessoftheinformation(between-units  .43, p  .01;
within-unit r.  .42, DEMO  .001). However, neither of these vari-
ables nor the DEMO relevance of attitudes correlated with
attitude accessibility ( p  .3, DEMO  .7, and p  .2, respectively).22
Finally, we DEMO repeated attitude expression for accessi-
bility in the path analysis of stability (Cooke & Sheeran, 2004;
Fazio et al., 1982; see DEMO 3). This analysis showed that the
proxy measure of accessibility influenced the attitude–behavior
relation through attitude stability (Sobel z  3.81, p DEMO .001; the
r  .21, p  .05directpathbetweenrepeatedattitudereportsand
theattitude–behaviorrelationbecamenonsignificant, p DEMO .7).Itis
important to note that the effect of accessibility on stability was
independent of the behavioral relevance of attitudes, the one-
sidedness of the attitude-related information, and the attitude con-
fidence. Thus, we concluded DEMO accessibility or retrieval of
attitudes influenced stability. Nonetheless, stability was also DEMO
tingent on factors facilitating attitude reconstruction.
Discussion
Several decades of research have stressed the importance of
understanding how attitudes guide behaviors (Eagly & Chaiken,
1993; Petty et al., 1995; Regan & Fazio, 1977)DEMO Given the signif-
icance of this topic, it is not surprising DEMO find several meta-
analyses addressing the multiple moderators of the attitude–
behavior relation. None of these meta-analyses, however, has
summarized the degree to DEMO newly formed attitudes predict
22 The behavioral relevance of attitudes did not vary within any condi-
tions reporting attitude stability. Only coefficients calculated on DEMO basis
of two or more studies were used to estimate the within-unit associations.

futurebehavior.Norhavetheyidentifiedthefactorsthatmoderate
attitude–behavior correlations in those cases. Perhaps more im-
portant, none of them focused on how those factors influence the
processes involved DEMO the prediction of behaviors from attitudes.
In our review, the overall DEMO attitude–behavior
correlationwas.52.Thiscorrelationishigherthanthe.38average
identified by Kraus (1995) when he included studies with low
attitude–behavior correspondence in object, context, and time
(e.g., prediction DEMO church attendance from attitudes toward reli-
gion). This correlation, however, is virtually identical to the one
Krausfoundwhenheincludedstudiesthatmeasuredattitudesand
behaviors in ways that were DEMO corresponding. This high
correspondence was the case of the reports synthesized in our
meta-analysis. To this extent, the results from this and Kraus’s
meta-analysesarecompatible(seealsoD.S.Wallaceetal.,2005,
for a recent discussion of the size of the DEMO corre-
lation). The weighted-mean correlation we found is also stronger
than the .38 correlation reported by Albarracı´n et al. (2001). This
earlier meta-analysis, however, was specific to the attitude–
behavior relation in the DEMO of condom use, a behavior that
varies widely with factors other DEMO attitudes (e.g., control per-
ceptions; Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005; DEMO & Albarracı´n, 2003;
Sheeran, Abraham, & Orbell, 1999).
The most important contribution of our meta-analysis comes
fromtheanalysisofmoderatorspertainingtoattitudeaccessibility
andattitudestability.Ourmeta-analysissuggeststhatpeopleform
attitudes more DEMO of behavior when they are motivated to
thinkabouttheobjecttheyareconsidering,havedirectexperience
with the attitude object, report their attitudes frequently, construct
their attitudes on the basis DEMO information that is relevant to the
behavior, receive or generate either DEMO or negative informa-
tion about the object, and believe that their DEMO are correct.
Furthermore, our findings shed light on the processes by DEMO
some of these factors influence the attitude–behavior correspon-
dence. In this regard, our review indicates that forming accessible
attitudes, considering the consequences of DEMO a behavior
when first forming an attitude, storing evaluatively consistent
(one-sided) information, and holding confident attitudes all allow
people to use these DEMO as a basis for future behaviors. In
addition, our review indicates DEMO attitude expression and direct
behavioralexperienceaffecttheattitude–behaviorcorrespondence
by influencing attitude accessibility. Further, according DEMO our
review,thebehavioralrelevanceofattitudes,theone-sidednessof
their informational bases, and the confidence with DEMO an atti-
tude is held influence the attitude–behavior relation because they
promote attitude stability. To our knowledge, no prior review has
documented all of these effects, nor has primary research previ-
ously established the mediating effects of all the moderators we
have examined.
Attitude Accessibility
Onefindingfromthismeta-analysisisthattheeffectofattitude
accessibility was DEMO in the between-units analyses.
Thisfindingisnotsurprisingifoneconsidersthelargedifferences
in attitude accessibility in different studies. These differences
couldnotbecontrolledinbetween-unitsanalyses.Mostimportant,
however, the effect became significant in the within-unit associa-
tionsbetweenresponsetimesandtheattitude–behaviorcorrespon-
dence. Moreover, when we controlled for between-units variance,
direct experience and repeated expression or report of the attitude
strengthened the attitude–behavior correspondence DEMO atti-
tudeaccessibility(seeFigure2).Thisconclusionisconsistentwith
Fazio’s (1989) model. However, our study DEMO a test of the
complete causal sequence from repeated attitude expression and
direct experience to attitude accessibility and attitude–behavior
consistency. Furthermore, the use of attitude-formation studies to
establish these causal connections is ideal. This approach, for
example, controls for the alternative hypothesis that the attitudes
people report more quickly derive from past behavioral perfor-
mances in that domain (see Bem, 1972).
Attitude Stability
According to Ajzen (1996) and Erber et al. (1995), the stability
of the attitude-related information influences the stability of atti-
tudesandtheextenttowhichtheseattitudespredictbehavior.This
possibility is consistent with findings from past primary research
(i.e., Doll & Ajzen, 1992) and meta-analyses (i.e., Cooke &DEMO
Sheeran, 2004; Kraus, 1995). However, our review precisely es-
tablishes the mediating role of stability. That is, the research on
attitude formation that we have synthesized allows us to observe
the relation between DEMO attitude stability across two time points
and the degree to which the initial attitude predicts subsequent
behavior. In contrast, similar findings using past attitudes could
imply that factors that affected attitude stability also affected the
attitude’sbehavioralimpact.Inthatcase,DEMO
behavior relation might or might not be causally associated.
Attitude Accessibility and Stability as Indicators of
Attitude Retrieval and Reconstruction
This article also clarifies DEMO attitude accessibility and stability
can capture partially different processes. First, our DEMO supports
previous findings suggesting that accessible attitudes are both
more stable and better predictors of behavior. This stability pre-
sumably occurs because accessible attitudes DEMO easily retrievable
frommemory.However,wealsofoundthatattitudescanbestable
and predictive of behavior when they are not retrieved from
memory but reconstructed on line. It is assumed that the DEMO
tionofattitudeswithbehavioralandone-sidedinformationmakes
earlier attitudes easier to reconstruct at the time people perform a
behavior(seeAjzen&Sexton,1999;Doll&Ajzen,1992;Erberet
al., 1995). This finding sheds light on previous controversies on
the role of accessibility and DEMO and the possibility of disen-
tangling the two.
Influences on Attitude Accessibility and Stability
Behavioral relevance of attitude-related information. Our
study underlines the congruence DEMO the information that
guides initial attitudes and the information used for a behavioral
decision later on. In the past, this conclusion was presented as a
measurement problem. Both primary research and meta-analyses
haverevealedthatattitudespredictbehaviorbetterwhenmeasures
of attitudes and DEMO correspond in target, context, time, and
action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977, 1980; Kim & Hunter, 1993;
Kraus,1995).Thepresentresults,DEMO,gobeyondthoseprior

ones. Our findings establish that attitudes predict behavior better
DEMO they rely on information relevant to a behavioral decision.
For instance, DEMO a behavior is instrumental, beliefs are more rele-
vant than affect. DEMO, if a behavior is public, attitudes ex-
pressed in public are more relevant than attitudes expressed in
private. That is, the behavioral relevance of the attitude-relevant
information guarantees the recycling of the attitude at the DEMO of
the behavior (see Figure 3).
Regarding the behavioral relevance DEMO the information associ-
ated with an attitude, our study has uncovered DEMO previously un-
knownroleofcognitionsabouttheoutcomesofabehavior.These
cognitions are key components of Ajzen and Fishbein’s (DEMO)
theory of reasoned action. According to this theory, a person’s
DEMO
that the behavior will bring about a set of salient outcomes (DEMO
bined with the perceived desirability of each of these outcomes).
Complementing this assumption, we found that stronger associa-
tions between attitudes and cognitions about behavior outcomes
correlated positively with attitude stability and attitude–behavior
consistency.
One-sidedness DEMO attitude-related information. This meta-
analysis shows that presenting one-sided information about an
object increases attitude stability. This stability occurs because
peopleinitiallyformandlaterreconstructattitudesonthebasisof
similarinformation(Schwarz&Bohner,DEMO;Wilson&Hodges,
1992). This conclusion replicates findings by Kraus (DEMO) and
CookeandSheeran(2004).Italsoreplicatesfindingsfromprimary
research on attitude ambivalence and inconsistency (R. Norman,
1975; Rosenberg, 1960, 1968). However, our meta-analysis DEMO
tends this work by disentangling prior controversial findings re-
garding the roles of ambivalence and inconsistency (see null
findings regarding attitude stability by Armitage & Conner, 2000;
Bassili, 1996; and reversals regarding attitude–intentions correla-
tion by Jonas et al., 1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002). In particular,
our results indicate that, all things being equal, DEMO one-
sidedness promotes higher attitude stability and stronger attitude–
behaviorcorrelations.However,theyalsosuggestthatpeoplewho
have inconsistent information about an object can nonetheless
exhibitstrongattitude–behaviorcorrelationswhentheyarehighly
motivatedtothinkaboutthatinformation.Itisassumedthathighly
motivatedindividualsareabletointegrateambiguousinformation
in a DEMO evaluative dimension (Sengupta & Johar, 2002; Tesser
& Cowan, 1977). Thus, they form attitudes that can be easy to
reconstruct despite the conflicting implications of the information
that is initially salient.
Confidence. This DEMO replicates prior reports that
confident attitudes are more predictive of behavior than doubtful
ones (Berger & Mitchell, 1989; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Jonas et
al., 1997; Tormala & Petty, 2002). Although we obtained a sig-
nificantattitudeconfidenceeffectonlyinthewithin-unitanalysis,
several things are significant in our results. DEMO, attitude confi-
dence reflected the one-sidedness of the attitudinal bases and
DEMO the attitude–behavior correlation by inducing greater
attitude stability. Second, by summarizing DEMO from novel
attitudes, our meta-analysis provides an indication about the di-
DEMO of the effect. Without this focus,itispossibletospeculate
that confident attitudes are associated with behavior because atti-
tudes that have not changed in the past DEMO perceived as confident
andarelikelytobestableinthefuture(seeAlbarracı´netal.,2004).
Ifthisweretrue,attitudeconfidencewouldbeaby-productofpast
stability, with DEMO causal role in the promotion of future stability.
Our meta-analysis helps to rule out this possibility.
The role of amount of thought. Results of DEMO synthesis sup-
portearlierconclusionsabouttheroleofmotivationtothinkabout
anissueintheattitude–behaviorcorrespondence.Inparticular,our
meta-analysis confirms that people who care about an issue when
theyfirstconsiderit(highoutcomeandvaluerelevance)aremore
likely to act on these attitudes DEMO participants who do not care
(B.T. Johnson & Eagly, 1989; DEMO & Elkin, 1987; Petty &
Cacioppo, 1986; Petty et DEMO, 1995).23
In addition, our meta-analysis establishes some of the media-
tional mechanisms of the influence of motivation on the attitude–
behaviorrelation.Inparticular,moderationandmediationanalyses
DEMO
attitudes with behavioral information. The association of attitudes
with behavioral information, DEMO turn, increases attitude stability
and the attitude–behavior relation. This process was DEMO sug-
gested by Ajzen (1996). He specifically argued that people DEMO
think about the attitude object are more able to consider informa-
tion that is relevant for later behaviors. High-thought people can
also discard information DEMO is temporarily salient but irrelevant.
However, we are the first to DEMO the complete sequence by
which motivation exerts this influence.
One aspect of this review that may surprise readers is that
concentration (lack of distracting stimuli in the external environ-
ment) did not have the expected effect on the attitude–behavior
association. However, other indicators of amount of thought
showed a consistently positive effect. Therefore, it seems neces-
sarytoawaitresearchwithmoreprecisemeasuresofconcentration
in the hope that increased precision will bring about coherent
findings.
The role of direct DEMO There has been an impressive
amountofresearchontheroleofdirectexperienceintheattitude–
behavior relation (e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; Cooke & Shee-
ran, 2004; Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Kraus,
1995).Inlightofthisevidence,theinitialinverserelationofdirect
experience and the attitude–behavior correlation found in our
study (see the 4th, DEMO, and 11th columns in Table 2) is puzzling.
In our analyses, however, direct experience was positively asso-
ciated with the attitude–behavior correlation DEMO we controlled
for the behavioral relevance and one-sidedness of the attitudinal
bases. In this regard, our synthesis suggests possible boundary
conditions for the positive effect of direct experience on the
attitude–behavior correspondence. First, direct experience does
notseemtoinducemoreconsequentialattitudeswhentheattitudes
and the behavior bases are incongruent (e.g., if people focus DEMO
feelings and then perform an instrumental behavior; Millar &
Tesser,1986).Second,acquiringdirectexperiencewiththeobject
may be as important in guiding behavior as receiving information
DEMO is unambiguous and consistent (i.e., evaluative diagnosticity;
23 Unlike past research by Cacioppo et al. (1986), indicants of chronic
motivation to think (need for cognition) had a marginally significant
impact on the DEMO relation in our synthesis. This lack of
effect, however, may reflect our use of median splits instead of the
selection of the most DEMO levels of need for cognition, as in Cacioppo
et al.’s research.

Reed, Wooten, & Bolton, 2002; see also Ha & DEMO, 1989; Hoch
&Ha,1986;Wooten&Reed,1998).Whenallelseisequal,direct
experience DEMO stimulate the use of attitudes as a basis for
behavior.However,directexperiencecanprovidemixedevidence
about the desirability of an object (e.g., people are presented with
neutrallyvalencedinformation;DEMO,2002;orproductswith
standard qualities; Hoch & Ha, 1986). To this extent, researchers
should take into account all direct experience, other indicators DEMO
behavioral relevance, and evaluative one-sidedness of the infor-
mation to understand DEMO impact of attitudes on behavior.
Validity of a Meta-Analysis and the Use of Between- and
Within-Unit Moderating Analyses
Inthissynthesis,weusedwithin-andbetween-unitsanalysesto
detect the moderators of DEMO attitude–behavior relation. Each of
these methods has unique advantages. On the one hand, within-
unitanalysesbetteraccountformethodologicaldifferencesamong
research paradigms. However, they depend on the manipulations
DEMO primary studies. In other words, they show what the primary
studies DEMO already shown.
On the other hand, between-units analyses are more vulnerable
DEMO differences among study procedures.24 This problem is most
acute when researchers make no attempt to control for potentially
confounding factors and when the meta-analysis DEMO not theory
based. However, between-units analyses have important advan-
tages. First, they go beyond primary research and allow research-
ers to address new DEMO and to use novel comparisons. For
example,studiestodatehaveseldom,ifever,jointlyestimatedthe
influence of direct experience and information with specific eval-
uative implications. In this context, the between-units procedures
permitted this integration. Second, multiple regressions of
between-units conditions estimated the combined influence of the
selected moderators and identified nonspurious relations. DEMO
analyses were not possible with the within-unit approach. Thus,
the inclusion of within- and between-units analyses allowed us to
go beyond previous research DEMO keeping a high level of meth-
odological rigor. Further, in the DEMO in which results with the
alternative methods conflicted, these differences led DEMO to identify
potential boundary conditions for the moderator’s effect. In other
words, the use of both methodologies provides a more valid
integration than the use of either methodology alone.
Attitude Formation Studies and the Validity and
DEMO of Our Findings
A unique aspect of our meta-analysis is the inclusion of attitude
formation rather than attitude change and survey studies. At first
DEMO,thiscriterionseemstolimittheamountofinformationinour
databasewithoutcontributingtoprecision.Forexample,peopleoften
applyinformationaboutoldattitudestothenewobjectstheyencoun-
ter (Prislin et al., 1998). Thus, attitude formation studies cannot
perfectlycontrolfortheone-sidednessoftheinformationunderlying
these new attitudes. However, attitude formation DEMO do provide
themostefficientcontrolforothermoderators.Forinstance,whenan
objectisfamiliar,participantsmighthavehaddirectexperienceswith

Similarly, studying the influence DEMO prior reports of attitudes is not
possibleoutsideofthestudiesmanipulatingtherepeatedexpressionor

report of attitudes. In contrast, selecting attitude formation studies
enabled us to classify all studies in terms of amount of thought,
information one-sidedness, behavioral relevance of the information,
and direct experience, among other moderators and potential con-
founds. Clearly, no attitude change study would contain information
about measures or manipulations of the 21 moderators and potential
confounds we have examined.
Integrating attitude DEMO (vs. attitude change) studies is also
importantforinferringcausalityfrommeta-analyticdata(seeShadish,
1996,foradiscussionofcausalinferencesinmeta-analyses).Thatis,
integrating attitude formation studies sets baseline levels of some
moderators (e.g., attitude stability, repeated expression of attitudes,
direct behavioral experience) at zero. Therefore, correlations involv-
ing those moderators provide appropriate estimates of the causal
associations among them. For example, the integration of attitude
formation studies helped us to better establish a link between acces-
sibilityandtheattitude–behaviorrelationbecausethisaspectreduces
the DEMO that accessible attitudes result from past behavioral
performances (an effect also DEMO in our meta-analysis).
Finally, our database included mostly laboratory experiments
DEMO
of our results. Although further research could explore the
attitude–behaviorrelationfollowingattitudeformationinthefield,
two things are noteworthy in our study. First, our results were
tested with different samples of conditions. The significance and
directionoftheeffectsreplicatedinmostcases.Onthesegrounds,
we can assume DEMO the results accurately apply to the population
of students in this specific setting.
Second, we also conducted analyses with the between-units
samples using two approaches: fixed-effects and random-effects
models.Thefixed-effectsapproachassumesthatthepopulationof
effect sizes is homogeneous. The random-effects approach as-
sumesthatthepopulationisheterogeneousandthusindicatesthat
the findings might be applicable to broader settings. In our DEMO,
results of the random-effects and fixed-effects approaches were
comparableinsizeandsignificance.Thisequivalenceofthefind-
ingsintherandom-effectsandfixed-effectsapproachesrendersthe
generalizability of our results to other settings plausible.
The Role of the Behavior DEMO
Afactorthatcouldalsoinfluenceourresultistheavailabilityof
different types of behavior measures. For example, some of the
DEMO The between-units analyses controlled for potential confounds in
several ways. First, DEMO tested the moderators’ effects using three different
samples of between-units conditions. Results replicated for most modera-
tors. Second, we estimated conclusions about between-units effects after
controlling for several potential confounding factors. That is, all multiple
regressionmodelsincludedindicatorsofthevalueoftheattitudeissue,the
typeofresearchparadigm,thepublicationstatusandyearofthestudy,and
the time between the attitude and behavior measures. DEMO, the shifting
unit of analyses approach controlled for the overrepresentation of DEMO
with more effect sizes. Fourth, the elimination of the within-subject mea-
DEMO in longitudinal reports discarded the statistically dependent condi-
tions.Finally,aspectssuchasthelaboratorysetting,theuseofstudentsas
participants, the relatively high credibility of the information sources, the
measure of DEMO behavior, and the use of frequency scales as attitude
measures were DEMO or almost constant in our database. Thus, proce-
dural differences could DEMO distort the between-units findings.
ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION

behaviors in our database were dichotomous (e.g., voting DEMO favor
of or against the institution of comprehensive exams). Other be-
haviors (e.g., the time participants played with puzzles) were
continuous. Continuous behavior measures can better capture dif-
ferent degrees of favorableness toward an DEMO Therefore, con-
tinuousbehaviorsmaybemorereliableindicatorsofattitudesthan
dichotomous ones (Jaccard & Blanton, 2005).
DEMO,
however, were homogeneous. For example, we excluded studies
involving behavior self-reports. Hence, behavioral responses did not
vary as a function of recall. In addition, participants in our database
hadequalbehavioralopportunitiesandfacednosituationalobstacles
to perform the behavior they chose. Further, in most cases, partici-
pants performed single behaviors or DEMO between behaviors that
represented different degrees of favorableness toward the attitude
object (e.g., sign a petition vs. join a committee). In only DEMO cases,
participants opted between different behavioral alternatives (i.e.,
Ajzen & Fishbein, 1970, 1974). To this extent, we do not DEMO
measures of behaviors to systematically bias our results beyond the
moderators we have already considered.
Implications for Future Research
This meta-analysis supports long-held assumptions DEMO how at-
titudes predict behaviors. Perhaps more important, it sheds light DEMO
mechanisms that underlie these predictions. For example, our data
support Fazio’s (1990) hypothesis that attitudes people access from
memoryeasilyaremorepredictiveofbehaviorsthanattitudesthatare
difficulttoaccess.Also,ourworkverifiesAjzen’s(1996)hypothesis
that the association of attitudes with behavior-related information
(which is more likely to occur when an issue is personally relevant)
strengthens the attitude’s DEMO with behavior. However, our
results suggest that people who receive unambiguous DEMO
maybehaveconsistentlywiththeirattitudesevenwhenthecontentof
that information is not behavioral. Therefore, future research should
establish DEMO conditions under which the behavioral relevance or the
one-sidedness of the information predominates.
Similarly,futureresearchcanalsoaddresstherelativeinfluence
of forming an attitude from direct experience or from DEMO
information. That is, direct experience proved to increase the
attitude–behavior correspondence. DEMO, our meta-analysis
suggests that this is more likely when the information DEMO people
acquireisone-sided.Wheninformationismixed,directexperience
should depress the attitude–behavior correlation. Further research
could examine this prediction.
Another ambiguity that our work could only partially resolve
concernstheimpactoftheone-sidednessoftheattitude-relatedinfor-
DEMO Contrary to most research on attitude ambivalence (see R.
Norman,1975;DEMO,1960,1968),recentresearch(e.g.,Jonaset
al.,1997;Sengupta&Johar,2002)hassuggestedthatheterogeneous
DEMO information can promote cognitive effort and thus
increase the attitude–behavior relation. However, as Sengupta and
Johar (2002) pointed out, this effect takes DEMO when the positive
informationandthenegativeinformationaresimultaneouslyaccessi-
ble. In our review, we could not DEMO for the accessibility of the
contradictory information at the time of the behavior performance.
However, such controls might be available in the future.
Finally, further work could also explore the possibility that the
attitude–behavior correlation is a function of nonlinear patterns. For
instance,ourresultssuggestthatinducinghighmotivationwhenone
processes double-sided information may DEMO attitude–behavior
correlations. However, this finding does not consider the degree or
DEMO,whenpeople
who must make a behavior decision consider positive and negative
outcomesofthebehavior,conflictresolutionmaybedifficult.Inthis
case, attitude–behavior associations might be strongest when rele-
vanceishighenoughtopromoteidentificationoftheconflictandthus

tionofdiametricallydifferentattitudes.Whateverthecase,ourmeta-
analysis shows that, despite the quantity of studies generated to
resolve the attitude–behavior problem, more process-oriented re-
searchisstillnecessarytounderstandhowattitudesguidebehaviors.
Implications for Practice
For many decades, scholars and practitioners have attempted to
find ways to induce the attitudes that best predict behaviors (see
Albarracı´netal.,2003;Armitage&Conner,2002;Echabe,Rovira,&
Garate,1988;Manfredo,Yuan,&McGuire,1992;Marsh,Johnson,&
Scott-Sheldon,2001;P.Norman&Smith,1995).Thismeta-analysis
can contribute to the design of DEMO interventions by identifying
factors that increase the behavioral impact of the attitudes one man-
agestoinduceinanaudience.Itsuggeststhat,forexample,agencies
aimingatincreasingthefrequencyofanewbehaviorshouldbewell
aware of the likely motivation of DEMO targets, the evaluative implica-
tions of the behavior, and the situational factors that typically influ-
ence the behavior they want to promote. Thus, audiences of those
agencies will benefit from receiving unambiguous behavioral infor-
mationaboutanobjectandfromattemptstoincreasetheirmotivation
DEMO think about the behavior being promoted.
Further, to induce desirable behaviors, agencies should consider
how clearly positive the experience with the object is DEMO to be.
Thus,forbehaviorsthatarelikelytobeclearlypositive(e.g.,eatinga
newtypeofcandy),inducingdirectexperiencewiththeobjectmaybe
the strategy of DEMO However, for experiences that are unlikely to
be unambiguously positive or DEMO negative (e.g., using a
newtypeofcondom,whichincreasesprotectionbutdecreasesphys-
ical pleasure), inducing direct experience may be less effective than
presentinginformationwhoseimplicationsarecontrolledbeforehand.
In addition to the likely DEMO of a behavioral experience,
agencies may look at factors related to the behavior they want to
promote.Forexample,eatingcandyismorelikelytobeahedonic
behavior.Usinganewtypeofcondomisaninstrumentalbehavior.
Thus, inducing a focus on feelings should be more effective for
promoting the new candy than DEMO promoting the new condom.
Finally, our results suggest that well-known strategies DEMO increase
the availability of attitudes for judgment (e.g., having people
express their attitudes, presenting memorable information about
the object) may also contribute DEMO successfully inducing attitudes
that predict the behaviors that persuaders want to promote.
Limitations and Perspectives
Despitetherelevanceofourfindingsforunderstandingthebehav-
ioralimpactofattitudes,thisresearchintegrationhaslimitations.First,
the selection of attitude formation DEMO allowed for a clear-cut
estimationofdifferentfactors(e.g.,thedegreetowhichparticipants’
attitudes were based on direct experience, the number of times they
818
GLASMANANDALBARRACI´N
wereexposedtoinformationabouttheobjectbeforehand).However,
people may easily generalize information about the DEMO of
familiarobjectstothenewattitudestheyform.Hence,theestimation
offactorssuchastheone-sidednessoftheinformationthatservesas
basis of people’s attitudes might not be as precise.
Second, as we explain in Footnote 24, we have taken DEMO
measurestocontrolforpotentialconfoundingfactors.Thesemeasures
also served to examine the validity of our findings across several
samples of conditions. However, in a meta-analysis, studies are not
randomlyassignedtoconditions.Hence,DEMO
studies may account for the observed effects. For example, direct
experience DEMO negatively associated with the attitude–behavior re-
lation in the between-units analyses but positively associated in the
within-unitanalyses.Aninspectionofthisfindingsuggestedthatthe
reversalwasaccountedforbyconditionswithlowbehavioralrelevance
of the initial attitudes. In other DEMO, however, unknown differences
among primary studies could contribute to the observed effects.
Third, although our database integrated 128 effect sizes, some of
DEMO
example, we were able to estimate the effect of most of DEMO relevant
moderatorsontheattitude–behaviorrelationusingthewholesample
of studies. However, our results regarding the processes by DEMO
accessibility and stability influence the attitude–behavior relation
included 43 and 19 units, respectively. Even though these analyses
stillcomprised1,612and864participants,futureresearchreplicating
our findings would increase confidence in our conclusions.
There are also factors that proved to influence DEMO attitude–
behavior association but were not considered in our integration. For
example, recent findings by Visser and Mirabile (2004) have under-
lined the influence of the social networks on attitude stability. Other
findings by Smith DEMO Terry (2003) and White, Hogg, and Terry
(2002) discussed the influence of in-group norms on the attitude–
behavior relation. Future accumulation DEMO work on the impact of
normative factors should allow researchers to incorporate them in a
broader model of the attitude–behavior relation. Similarly, future
research on attitude formation should take advantage of real-world
situations.Thesecouldincludetheintroductionofnewhealthrecom-
mendations, political candidates, or consumer products.
Finally, results of this meta-analysis apply to the DEMO of
behavior from novel attitudes. The formation of a new attitude is
probably the most effective way to experimentally control the prop-
ertiesofanattitudeandtheassociatedinformation.However,people
DEMO,
theymaysimplyusethoseattitudeswithoutattemptingtoreconstruct
them later on (see Lingle & Ostrom, 1981). Even more relevant, as
objects become familiar, attitudes can connect to DEMO values of the
individualsholdingthem.Peoplewhoconsidertheirattitudesimpor-
tant seek more information about the attitude object and have better
memoryforissuesrelatedtotheattitude(Holbrook,Berent,Krosnick,
Visser, & Boninger, DEMO). To this extent, determining whether atti-
tudes are important may DEMO critical to understanding the attitude–
behavior relation when attitudes are well established.
Conclusion
Theattitude–behaviorrelationhasbeenatthecenterofdiscussion
in social psychology for years. At one point in time, discouraging
findings regarding the size of the attitude–behavior relation stimu-
lated recommendations DEMO abandon the attitude concept altogether
(Wicker,1969).Thispessimismwasfortunatelycounteredbyefforts
to identify the DEMO that make attitudes more consequential for
overtbehaviors(e.g.,Ajzen,1991;Ajzen&Fishbein,1980;Ajzen&
Madden,1986;Barghetal.,1996;Doll&Ajzen,1992;Fazio,1989,DEMO
1990; Fazio et al., 1982; Fazio & Towles-Schwen, 1999; DEMO &
Zanna, 1978a, 1978b; Kraus, 1995; Sengupta & Fitzimons, 2000;
Wilsonetal.,1984).Theseeffortshaveledtotheaccumulationofa
large literature on the attitude–behavior relation, DEMO has been
incorporated into at least 10 previous meta-analyses (Armitage &
Conner,2001;Cooke&Sheeran,2004;Eckes&Six,1994;Farleyet
al.,1981;Kim&DEMO,1993;Kraus,1995;Notani,1998;Sheppard
et al., 1988; Van den Putte, 1993; D. S. Wallace et al., 2005).
The existence of 10 attitude–behavior meta-analyses across
domains and various others relevant to specific DEMO (e.g.,
Albarracı´netal.,2003;Hausenblas,Carron,&Mack,1997;Lynn
& McCall, 2000; Sheeran et al., 1999; Whitley, Nelson, & Jones,DEMO
1999) suggests that there are answers to the most important ques-
DEMO about this problem. However, a closer analysis of the prior
synthesesindicatesthatsuchaconclusioniswrong.First,DEMO
other meta-analyses included a range of studies with varying
degrees of rigor in methodological control, in our meta-analysis,
we have explored the processes responsible for the attitude–
behaviorrelationbyselectingstudiesaboutattitudeformation.By
doing so, we were able to examine the factors influencing atti-
tudes, which can be more efficiently observed when attitudes are
produced experimentally. Further, out of the 10 most general
meta-analyses, only Kraus’s (1995) and Cooke and Sheeran’s
(2004) examined the roles of the moderators that we also exam-
ined. However, neither Kraus’s nor Cooke and Sheeran’s studies
estimatedthemoderators’jointcontributionandthewaystheycan
be sequentially arranged. In contrast, our meta-analysis integrates
memory-based and online processes in a comprehensive, theoret-
ical interpretation of the attitude–behavior process.
Intermsofpracticalimplications,ourresultssuggestthatattitudes
influencefuturebehaviorswhentheyareeasytoretrievefrommem-
ory and stable over time. DEMO addition, our meta-analysis shows that
expressingattitudesrepeatedlyandhavingdirectexperiencewiththe
attitude object influence the attitude–behavior DEMO by inducing
higher attitude accessibility. Our study also indicates that being mo-
tivatedtothinkaboutanobjectorissuepromotesattitudesassociated
with one-sided and behavior-relevant information. Forming attitudes
onthebasisofbehavior-relevantinformation,receivingorgenerating
one-sided information, and believing that one’s attitudes are correct,
in turn, strengthen the attitude–behavior relation via greater attitude
stability.Giventhesefindings,ourmeta-analysisisthefirsttomean-
ingfullyintegratetheprocessesthatunderlietheinfluenceofattitudes
on behavior. We hope DEMO future research and applications will
benefit from this integration.
