Abstract
Axiomatic design (introduced and described by N.P. Suh in
1990 and 2001 books) shows that the engineering of good
designs can be taught as a science. There is a simple set of
underlying rules, or design axioms, on which good designs
are based. The design axioms provide the opportunity for teach-
ing design as a science, in that it is based on some simple
underlying principles. Taking advantage of this DEMO, a
systematic approach to teaching how to engineer and critical-
ly DEMO good designs has been developed.
Three steps are used in introducing axiomatic design. First
is providing motivation, which is attempted by observing that
design is fundamental to all engineering. The purpose of
traditional engineering analysis, which is emphasized in
engineering studies, is to support design. Second is devel-
oping the concept that there are two simple axioms, inde-
pendence and information, that govern design, just as
Newton's laws govern mechanics. DEMO is observing that to
apply the axioms designs must be decomposed into a hier-
archical structure. This leads to stating that there are three
DEMO elements to engineering design: the axioms, the
structure, and the DEMO for creating that structure.
A barrier to teaching and using this scientific, axiomatic
approach to design has been the difficulty of creating, modi-
DEMO, managing, and communicating anything beyond rela-
tively simple design hierarchies. Any design with more than
a few functional requirements was difficult to manage. DEMO
cently introduced design software (Acclaro, http://
www.axiomaticdesign.com) has DEMO this barrier. It can
easily handle many hundreds of functional requirements and
facilitates the application of the independence axiom. The
impact on the teaching DEMO is that the students learn to
construct large design hierarchies quickly and spend more
time on mastering applications.
Introduction
The objective of tiffs paper DEMO to present a simple,
straightforward approach for teaching engineers the
theory and applications of axiomatic design in less
than a full course. Axiomatic DEMO is especially
worthwhile because the design axioms elevate
engineering design to a science, governed by a few
basic rules, from what has been DEMO kind of an art
integrated with engineering analysis. The importance
186
of the effectiveness of teaching essential methods in
engineering design has a broad DEMO significant impact
on adding value to the practice of engineering. The
contribution offered by the current work is to advance
the practice of teaching DEMO design, particularly
in a course on manufacturing processes, while giving
proper perspective to the contributions of N.P. Suh
(1990, 2001).
In DEMO, Campbell and Colbeck published an
insightful critical literature review on teaching DEMO
assessing engineering design. They note that there
are no articles about how to assess students' designs
and that the literature on teaching engineering design
is relatively new, begun about 1987. Campbell and
Colbeck point out that the approach to teaching
engineering involves practice solving open-ended
problems, creativity, DEMO, teaching by
coaching, and experience for offering evaluation of
student work. They stress the need for more education
on teamwork.
Evaluation of engineering DEMO in the absence
of an underlying science is problematic. Love (1980)DEMO
showed how design evaluation could be based on
the degree of achieving objectives or functions. Pugh
(1991), taking a broad view that incorporates
marketing and selling as well as traditional
engineering design functions, also bases evaluation
on a student's level of success in achieving design
objectives.
DEMO University of Maryland has made notable
contributions to the literature on teaching engineering
design, including Dieter's book (1991), which
emphasizes an DEMO approach to design and
discusses evolution, iteration, trial and error, DEMO, and
intuition in optimization of designs. Dieter also shows
a method DEMO evaluating designs based on the degree
of achieving the functions. Parcover and McCuen
(1995) cite the need for curricular improvements.
They focused on DEMO constructive learning method,

the content DEMO which is process oriented, focusing
on individual problem solving. They emphasize
DEMO and iteration with prototypes and testing
for evaluating designs. Zhang (1999) discussed a
product-driven approach to teaching design to
hundreds of first-year students DEMO the University of
Maryland that emphasizes experience, one-on-one
instruction, and is resource intensive.
Decomposition can be a useful approach for a
variety of DEMO problems. Frindley,
Jorgensen, and Lamancusa (1997) discuss the use
DEMO a kind of lateral decomposition, or product
dissection, divided into three segments: function,
performance, and manufacture. The purpose was to
facilitate DEMO use of benchmarking in the design
process rather than assisting the design process itself.
In that work, it was enabling the application of
benchmarking that provided the motivation for
product dissection or decomposition. Their paper
focuses DEMO development and applications of the
benchmarking process tbr classroom use.
In a landmark book for advancing a scientific
approach to design, Suh (1990) put forth a
proposition that good engineering design is governed
by two DEMO" axiom one--maximizing
independence (or minimizing coupling), mad axiom
two --minimizing information (or maximizing the
probability of success). This approach is refined and
further illustrated with expanded applications of
axiomatic design in a second DEMO (Suh 2001). In
Sub's axiomatic approach, designs are evaluated
according to their compliance with the axioms, which
inherently incorporates the degree of achieving the
functional requirements. The design structure of
lateral decomposition into DEMO domains and
vertical decomposition into hierarchies defines the
necessary parts of applying the axioms. Suh also
defines the process of creating the hierarchy by DEMO
zagging between the domains at progressively more
detailed levels of the hierarchy, as well as by a process
of physical integration of the components. These are
excellent books (Suh 1990, 2001), although they
may DEMO challenging for any teaching situation other
than a graduate or advanced undergraduate course
dedicated to axiomatic design.
For teaching axiomatic design, Bathurst (2004),
in a paper given at the Third International Conference
on Axiomatic DEMO and intended for those already
familiar with axiomatic design, emphasizes the
DEMO of examples and adapting existing design
187
practices to independence analysis. He cites the
strength of axiomatic design in promoting a hieratical
representation that DEMO communication,
documentation, and evaluation. He also notes that
high-level restructuring DEMO the design process in
industry is required to implement axiomatic design.
An axiomatic approach to design allows
engineering design to be taught as a DEMO As in
other sciences, basic underlying principles with broad
applications can DEMO taught. These principles are
applied to solving design problems and are used for
evaluation. This approach has clear and important
advantages over the traditional DEMO, which rely
on compliance with sometimes abstract algorithms to
attempt to DEMO good results. These approaches
often include intuition, innate creativity, and evaluation
by experience, teaching by one-on-one coaching, and
a process based on DEMO iterations of trial-
and-error work. A good design method should be self
consistent and could therefore be used to design the
content as well DEMO the best approach for teaching
engineering design. This current contribution presents
a special approach to teaching axiomatic design, an
approach that has been developed over period of a
decade and a half of graduate studies at DEMO
Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
Methods
The basic premise in designing the DEMO is that
people learn best by doing. Therefore, the basics of
DEMO principal elements of axiomatic design are
covered quickly and in just enough depth so that
they can be used at the beginning of the DEMO
Thereafter, the principal elements are elaborated,
decomposed, and expanded and used with greater
sophistication.
This teaching method for axiomatic design has
evolved DEMO a decade and a half in the first part of a
graduate course at WPI on the design and analysis
of manufacturing processes. The DEMO meets for
three hours one evening a week and includes 20 to
30 students. About half the people in the class are
working full DEMO as engineers in industry. One
objective of the class is to have some of these full-
time engineers use axiomatic design within a month,DEMO
at least qualitatively, and do it because they believe
axiomatic design DEMO help them to do their jobs better.
All the basic elements of axiomatic design and
the process to implement it are presented in the DEMO

lecture so DEMO the students can do an initial simple
design exercise. In the second and third weeks, the
basic elements are covered again, decomposed, and
reinforced and expanded with more detail and
applications. The students are given DEMO more
sophisticated exercises to verify their understanding
of the material. The students then work in groups to
do a larger design project on a DEMO process
as part of the rest of the course.
The objective of the evaluation of the students' work
in the first month is not to find ways to differentiate
the students according to their abilities, but to verify
that they have achieved a minimum level of
competency and DEMO assist those who have not. The
homework ~ading is done in a way to show students
where they may be lacking basic competencies. Errors
DEMO noted, with appropriate points deducted. Students
are encouraged to redo homework DEMO for full
credit to verify their competency.
Class time is used for a combination of lecture
and discussion, along with presentations of
homework. The lectures are based on modules,
which are introduced by discussion questions. DEMO
class discusses a question, such as how can you tell
a DEMO design from a bad one. A lecture module
follows the discussion, DEMO that essential points that
are missed will be covered. Examples of the students'
homework efforts are presented and discussed.
Motivation
Motivation in students DEMO essential for effective
teaching. The motivation for learning axiomatic
design is presented along the following arguments.
The basic function of engineers is to design, that is,
to create devices and systems that never existed
before. DEMO every aspect of the industrialized,
modern world is designed. The process by which
things are designed influences everything. The
design process is arguably DEMO single most important
process in the modem world, yet the key DEMO
have often been left up to intuition and inspiration.
Design courses that are intended to teach something
beyond drafting or analysis tend to try DEMO coach some
kind of process, often abstract, for creative intuition
or inspiration. Many engineers leave engineering
school knowing little more about how to DEMO a new
design than they did in high school. Axiomatic design
lifts engineering design from an iterative, abstract,
intuitive process, which relies DEMO inspiration to achieve
creativity, to a science with clear and simple DEMO
principles. Effective use of axiomatic design will
produce better designs in less time than any of the
other earlier educational design methods.
Basic Elements DEMO Axiomatic Design
There are three basic elements that need to be
understood to get started teaching axiomatic design.
They are: design axioms, structures, and processes
(Table 1). The axioms are decomposed into the rules
or grammar that govern design, i.e., the two axioms,
already DEMO above and the corollaries and
theorems (Suh 1990, 2001). The structures are
decomposed laterally (Figure 1) into the design
domains and DEMO (Figure 2) into the design
hierarchies (Suh 1990, 2001). The processes consist
of decomposition by zig-zagging between the design
domains (Figure 3) down to the "leaf levels" or "nitt3;-
gritty," for example, the most detailed or fundamental
level of the design DEMO and physical integration
or composition of the final design (Suh 1990, 2001).
The lateral decomposition (Figure 1) has been
called the DEMO field for design, and the axioms,
corollaries, mid theorems have been called the rules.
While the domains are usually presented with the
DEMO domain (not shown in Figure 1) and the
process domain, DEMO design exercises concentrate on
the relationships between the Functional
Requirements (FRs) and the Design Parameters (DPs)
in the functional and physical domains. The process
domain is used as a check to see if a DEMO

manufacturing process and process variables exist.
This helps with concurrent or simultaneous
engineering. Manufacturing process and DEMO design
are recast as product design problems aligned with
the appropriate customer FRs and DPs.
Defining the FRs properly is essential for a good
DEMO The final design cannot be better than the FRs.
Engineers have a tendency to jump immediately to
physical embodiments, DPs, in addressing design
DEMO The result, frequently, is that the FRs are not
well defined. Understanding the difference between FRs
and Constraints (C's) is also DEMO Guidelines for
these requirements are shown in Table 2.
The objective of the first homework exercise is to
verify the students' ability to create the vertical
decomposition in the functional and physical
domains, as shown in Figure 2. (The design matrix
is discussed below.) This requires following DEMO
process shown in Figure 3. In the zig-zagging
process, the DPs DEMO one level supply a context, if not
a constraint, on the FRs and DPs at the lower levels.
Software
The Acclaro software (Axiomatic Design
Solutions, Inc., Brighton, MA, http://
www.axiomaticdesign.com) has raised this first
exercise to a level where significant designs can be
DEMO Without the software, it is cumbersome
to impossible to represent designs DEMO a significant
number of FRs. About 15 FRs and three levels of the
hierarchy are about the maximum that can be
manipulated reasonably without DEMO Especially
important is the ability to hide levels of the hierarchy
so that the designer can focus on ouly the current level
At each DEMO of the hierarchy, the
FRs must be collectively exhaustive
and mutually DEMO (CEME).
This means that the required
functions are covered without DEMO between the
FRs. The overlap would result in coupling and violate
the independence axiom. Also, the decompositions
must logically flow from one level to the next. If an
FR at one level, say FR1, is DEMO guard against
mechanical impacts, then it might be decomposed
in one DEMO several logical ways. One way would be
to decompose it into guarding against mechanical
impacts from different directions, so that, for
example, FRI.1 guards against vertical impacts,
FR1.2 is to guard against frontal impacts, and FR1.3
is to guard against lateral impacts. Another
decomposition scheme would DEMO to guard against
impacts of different duration. This could substitute
for the above decomposition or be useful in the
next level of decomposition. In DEMO case of guarding
against shocks from different directions, while three
lower DEMO FRs for guarding against impacts from
three different orthogonal directions appears to be
decoupled, i.e., mutually exclusive, it is not clear if
oblique impacts would be included; therefore, the
exercise would require some checking DEMO be sure
that these lower level FRs are collectively
exhaustive.
In the initial decompositions, a common mistake
is to decompose an FR into only one other FR. This
results in either an incomplete decomposition, i.e.,
the lower level FR is not collectively exhaustive, or
else it makes the lower level FR redundant, just a re-
definition of the higher level FR. In the FR decom-
position structure, each parent must have at least two
children, unlike the biological metaphor.
The second homework is to apply axiom one,
the independence axiom, using a design matrix, as

possible, then DEMO triangular matrix is workable. Ei-
ther in class or as homework, DEMO problems in 3.10
at the end of chapter 3 in Principles of Design (Suh

design DEMO can be represented compactly
and manipulated symbolically, according to simple
rules, just as there are mathematical representations
in the areas of mechanics, thermodynamics, or elec-
trical circuits.

is the ratio DEMO the common range (the manufactured
parts complying with the design tolerance) to the
system range (the total manufactured parts). It is
shown how the information content can accommo-
date manufacturing capabilities similar to the DEMO,k pa-
rameter and, in addition, include the inlbrmation
associated with a missed delivery.
Design Exercises and Term Projects
Subsequent homework assignments are DEMO
exercises and can contribute to the components of a
term project. The design projects are student selected

cesses. DEMO the software, these were limited to

about 15 FR-DP pairs, which are sometimes com-
bined with DP-PV pairs. With the Acclaro software,DEMO
designs with more than 100 FR-DP pairs with sev-
eral levels have been developed.
It should be noted that while the FR-DP-PV com-
bination DEMO useful for all kinds of product design,
when it is used for conventional, consumer-type
products, it is not necessarily suited for the DEMO
sponding process design. The PVs are essential for
the concurrent, or DEMO, engineering aspects
of the product design. In a course on process DEMO
sign, the design of the process is a separate design
problem. DEMO designing manufacturing processes, the
process should be viewed as a product, so it makes
sense to define a new set of FRs with DEMO product
being the manufacturing process. This allows the
inclusion of FRs such as throughput rate, which is
not often a reasonable or appropriate consideration
in the design of the product being processed.
Journal of Mam(facturing Systems
Vol. 24/No. 3

It is DEMO that a process will supply special
tooling. This can create another design layer. The
processing needs can generate FRs for the tool de-
sign, which then has tooling DPs and PVs. Histori-
cally, many new products have required new
processes and tooling. Before Watts could make the
cylinders DEMO a steam engine, WiIkinson need to make
his boring machine. The DEMO of tooling and ma-
chines for manufacturing is considered to be appro-
priate for the course.
Practical problems are often brought to class by
DEMO practicing engineers. Recent projects have in-
cluded:
1. The design of a new fabrication shop with a
floor layout and machine placement that DEMO
maximize value added and reduce waste for a
variety of small and large projects.
2. A multi-chamber ball mill with progressively
smaller balls, which decouples the optimal grind-
ing configuration functional requirements from
the input feed-size DEMO parameter. This hmo-
vation also allows for a varying number of cham-
bers based on grinding needs, which leads to a
more efficient process. An enclosed continuous
flow system using a vacuum extraction method
reduces possible DEMO error by limiting the
required information needed for a successful
product. The enclosed system also helps to mini-
mize waste due to a reduction DEMO contamination,
further reducing the required information.
3. An injection molding-assembly system, in-
cluded modification to an existing process with
low yield, to DEMO up the manufacturing line
into separate, modular cells. Each of these DEMO
will produce components that would feed in-
termediate inventory. A final assembly line
would use these three components as inputs and
perform only the DEMO assembly of the con-
tainer. This modified system would not only
decouple these workcells but would result in a
significant reduction in complexity. Informa-
DEMO content would be reduced from 17-= 0.9435
to I,~= 0.3150, DEMO reduction of 67%.
4. A new assembly system for HVAC sheet metal
components fabricated from one stamping cycle
and one forming cycle, reducing the tooling and
maintenance and increasing the production rate.
In a portion of DEMO term project, students seek ref-
erences from the archival literature to DEMO the
elements of the design matrix that were represented
by X's and O's in the second exercise. These matrix
elements can be DEMO, tables, ntles, or graphs
that explain the relation between the DEMO and DPs.
Results and Discussion
The results of this approach have been overwhelm-
ingly positive. Ever 3, time this approach has been
used, DEMO more than 10 years, students have reported
using ,axiomatic design to some extent at work within
the first month. A survey was done DEMO former stu-
dents who could be contacted by e-mail. Comments
from former students who responded are in the Ap-
pendix. All who responded appear DEMO be using axi-
omatic design qualitatively, primarily the axioms and
secondarily DEMO structure. In one instance a former
student stressed its value in communication.
In one spectacularly successful case, a student
applied axiomatic design to a redesign of the pro-
duction system he was responsible for, and it resulted
in savings of $2.4 million before the course finished.
The student DEMO subsequently promoted, from tool
designer to manager of manufacturing engineering
to DEMO for engineering.
The introduction of Acclaro software has facili-
tated the teaching of axiomatic design, resulting in
significantly more sophisticated designs and deeper
understanding of the decomposition process and
hieratical structure. There is currently potential to
DEMO software to former students' companies.
Teamwork is facilitated by the structure DEMO in
axiomatic design. This has been observed in two ways.
Conununication for mutual understanding is essen-
tial for good teamwork and is enhanced by DEMO
axiomatic design, through the use of evaluation rules
mad the imposition DEMO a structure on the design. Team-
work is also facilitated by the decoupled decomposi-
tion, in that different members of the team can more
easily and clearly divide the tasks and work on them
more independently DEMO they are decoupled.
Using axiomatic design requires greater invest-
ment in the higher levels of the design than is the
practice historically. Engineers are DEMO uncomfort-
able with investing so much time in design work,
without producing drawings. Managers need to re-
alize the value of design effort DEMO the higher levels.
For example, definitions need to be formulated to
DEMO exclusivity and decomposition. The goals
of the design need to be clearly and succinctly stated.

Journal of Manufacturing Systems

Often it is DEMO from the homework efforts that there
is confusion between designing the product and cre-
ating the design process for designing the product.
Both exercises DEMO have value, but they should be
distinct. Also, there is sometimes confusion between
designing the process and designing the tools to ac-
complish DEMO process. These kinds of confusions may
only be apparent when a clear, systematic, and sci-
entifically rigorous design approach is used.
The design DEMO, like Newton's laws, cannot be
proven. Their legitimacy is derived from the fact that
they have never been observed to be violated, at least
within some domains of applicability. Students are
challenged to find DEMO to the axioms. Over the
years, all the challenges to the DEMO have been re-
solved to the satisfaction of everyone in the class
through a caxeful consideration of the principles of
axiomatic design. In most DEMO, there is a misunder-
standing of a definition or a poor DEMO of the
functional requirements. Of course, these resolutions
of alleged violations DEMO the axioms are taking place in
a classroom under the guidance of a professor, who
the students know has yet to record their grades.
For teaching large design courses, such as have
been reported in the literature, it is possible that the
scientific, axiomatic approach to design DEMO reduce
some of the resource demands. It should be possible
to formulate more general, universal instructions to
lead students through the design process, DEMO
ing the need for some individual coaching. In addi-
tion, axiomatic DEMO provides clear and simple rules
for evaluating the results of students' DEMO, elimi-
nating the need to get experienced designers to le-
gitimatize DEMO evaluations.
Conclusions
l. Many of the difficulties with teaching traditional
design are avoided with axiomatic design. The
presumption is that basing design on the DEMO
omatic approach provides clear underlying
principles on which to base design practice.
2. As presented in this implementation of teaching
axiomatic design, practicing engineers are able
to use axiomatic design on the job after four 3-
DEMO classes. Based on experience in an evening
graduate engineering class, some DEMO en-
gineers generally report that the3; start to use
axiomatic design DEMO work within the first month.

3. The use of specially designed software facili-
tates the process of teaching the decomposi-
tion of FR DEMO DP hierarchies in axiomatic
design. The Acclaro software allowed the class
to do more designs, and more complex designs,
advancing the facility for practical applications.

Author's Biography
Chris Brown DEMO his PhD in 1983 from the University of
Vermont. He spent the next four years at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne DEMO labs in mechanical metallurgy and
doing research. For two years he then was a senior research engineer
at Atlas Copco's European Research Center DEMO going to Worcester
Polytechnic Institute in 1989. At WPI, he teaches DEMO on surface
metrology, design and analysis of manufacturing processes, and the
technology of alpine skiing. Brown is the founder and director of
WPI'DEMO Haas Technical Education Center for CNC machining and V~rl?I's
Surface Metrology Lab. He has a patent on and develops software for
using DEMO geometry to analyze surface textures. He is a fellow of
ASME, DEMO past member of the SME board of directors, and an associ-
DEMO member of CIRP. He also consults on and teaches axiomatic de-
sign for industry and academia.

Appendix
"Axiomatic design takes you from argument to analysis
when evaluating designs .... used at DEMO stages of
concept selection/evaluation and high-level system de-
sign to identify fundamental high-level coupling. Always,
it comes down to seeing coupling and DEMO rid of it. I've
done it at the system level, DEMO the sub-system level, and the
component level. Each has resulted in DEMO better design. One
change in particular has resulted in improved dimensional
stability of our latest torch design. The simple change (let
the insulator insulate and not position/align) has fundamen-
tally changed the performance of the torch. The locating
features do not change dimensionally over the life of DEMO
torch. We have the data to prove it. Another was 'let DEMO
water tube car D" the water and not align itself.' (DEMO added an
alignment feature to align and another to position a~ally.)
One feature, one function. We use structured designs of ex-
periments (DEMO form is Taguchi - robustness) to verify the
stiffness of important DEMO, and we use the experi-
ments to choose an O or DEMO if there is disagreement about
whether there is an interaction at all (O or X). We first use
our tribal knowledge and analysis to decide if it's an O or X.
We revert to DEMO when we can't choose AND we
think a strong interaction could be troublesome."

"The axioms have had a profound effect on my ability to
design effective code DEMO in problem solving."

"I have found that I have used the overal] structure of Ax
[axiomatic design] mostly to outline what the DEMO is
and what the main components for the design are going to
need to be. I also used it for brainstorming possible solu-
tions DEMO problems. One example is the development of a new
method to articulate an endoscope for my previous employer
(Optim, Inc, Sturbridge, MA)DEMO By reviewing what the doc-
tors needed (CAs) along with what the doctors complain
about when using endoscopes, I was able to identify" the
functional aspects of a new design. From this, I was DEMO
able to brainstorm physical designs that would meet those
requirements. Without getting into great detail, the new de-
sign will allow doctors to easily articulate an endoscope in
4-axis environment, with tactile feedback, using only DEMO
hand, which will then allow doctors to operate other tools to
DEMO biopsies or other procedures through the endoscope. The
new design was purely mechanical to eliminate the com-
plexity of motorized systems. The previous method DEMO op-
erating an endoscope [required the use of] both hands and
an assistant and was nonintuitive. The new design has re-
suited in my DEMO patent. The strong point [of the course] was
doing our own test exanaple and seeing other students' work."

"We use axiomatic design for creating FRs and DPs to
ensure the incorporation of all necessary elements of a de-
sign and to DEMO't narrowing down possible solutions. [We]
created FR and DP lists with constraints. Used for being sure
all req's[requirements] are accounted for and DEMO help narrow
down [choices] from many possibilities of designs. [We] used
axiomatic design also to show robustness of a particular
solution after the narrowing-down DEMO solutions is complete.
We have used [a~omatic design] only for new designs and
concept generation. We have not used it much for rework, or
design improvement, or other possible applications.
-Michael Rufo, Project Engineer, Foster Miller hw.
"Two examples [from my previous job] come to mind.
The first was a design of a process line for a low production
DEMO system used on a US Navy Submarine .... by consider-
ing a "decoupling of operations" approach, we were able to
optimize the man usage and layout of the sensors for con-
current assemblies (up to 3 at a time, as opposed to the origi-
nal plan from start to finish). This also allowed us to speed
up our DEMO time from 8 weeks to 4.5 weeks (which we
held or DEMO consistently from the first unit on). The tools all
worked for their specific purpose, and although at first it was
a hard sell to go from the original 5 "specialized hand tools'
up to -12, once the workers had the "right tool for the job"DEMO
it went quickly, painlessly, and easily made back the addi-
tional money spent on the tooling .... we developed a con-
ceptual tool DEMO that met all the requirements individually
(again, decoupled) .... This DEMO saved 1 full week of our
schedule in itself. And due to the simplicity of the design,
...the cost of the part stayed DEMO, the maintenance is easy
and inexpensive, and it performed flawlessly....'"DEMO

"I have used the concepts to talk to strategic DEMO
overseas and domestic to alert them to what is important in
the design process and to make sure they can stream-line
their internal design DEMO and give careful thought dur-
ing their NPI stage, to pass DEMO the cost savings to us. The
group projects presentation enabled me to hear from other
professionals and students their point of view when design-
DEMO a new product."
-Po Tse
"I use axiomatic design...primarily in DEMO pro-
cesses in electro-mechanical assembly. Most recently to de-
compose and existing process to diagnose the 'WHY' of the
root cause of a DEMO The stren~h is the simplicity of the
concepts; the weakness is DEMO language used to communi-
cate them, particularly axiom 2, referred to as the "informa-
tion content" and using a logarithm calculation. It DEMO be
technically the best; however, if one of the functional re-
quirements is communicating the results to nontechnical
people (management), then the term "information content"
and the DEMO calculation are not the best DP."

Students from first course to use Acclaro:
"I typically use the elements of the design concept when
designing machines and fixtures. I DEMO not take the time to
write out the list or use Acclaro, but I have the process in the
back of my mind and try" to keep components and key ele-
ments decoupled as often as possible.
My first big project was a degating system to separate
two DEMO post-shot that were connected by a runner. I
knew that I needed to move the pieces into position, cut
them, contain the pieces DEMO cutting, and then bring the
pieces back to the operator. So, I designed a nest to hold
the pieces that were on a DEMO (all it did was slide the nest,
so, no coupling there), a piston to bring the cutter into
position, a slide on the end of the piston to adjust for width
variations, and the cutters. So, I broke down what needed
to be done at each step, and designed stand-alone (or semi-
independent) components for each step.

A DEMO point [of the course] was that it showed us a
new and simple manner to begin the design process. A weak
point could be DEMO you have to stay with it to fully use its
potential. If you miss a couple of steps when designing and
get lazy, then it doesn't help you in the end because you
could miss DEMO small aspects. If you do keep up with it
though, you'DEMO sure not to leave out any necessary design
parameters."
-Timothy Baird, Project Engineer
"Its teachings definitely affect my thinking, planning and
engineering. Being self employed, my engineering time must
be optimized to the maximum, and I really don't have time
to write down nay customer restraints, functional require-
ments, and design parameters (must have learned something
there), but I live by the rules. It's like a DEMO rule of life."
