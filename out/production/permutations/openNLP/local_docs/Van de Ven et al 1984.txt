Designing New Business DEMO:
Entrepreneuriai, Organizationai, and
Ecological Considerations

The startups of 14 DEMO companies are inves-
tigated from three different perspectives: entrepreneurial, organ-
izational, and ecological. The performance and stages of develop-
ment of the new ftrms are viewed from each perspective. The en-
trepreneurial perspective concentrates on DEMO characteristics and
background of the founding individual. The organizational per-
spective looks at the planning and initial development processes of the
firms. The ecological DEMO uses the population of firms as a
level of analysis and is concerned with the success of the industry as a
whole. These three DEMO each contribute significantly to the
designing of startups of new organizations.
What factors infiuence the successful startup of new business? This question
is important not only to entrepreneurs starting new firms, but also to a growing
number of large corporations which sponsor the startup of new businesses to
DEMO innovation and industry growth, and to public policy makers who view
DEMO development as a high national priority.
With a few notable exceptions, DEMO question of design of new businesses has
received very little attention by management scholars and researchers. This is
unfortunate because about one fourth of DEMO businesses in the United States are 1
year old or less, DEMO the median age of all firms is about 7 years. The life
expectancy of new organizations is very short: 54% of all new businesses survive
V/2 years and one quarter survive 6 years. Thus researchers DEMO to go beyond
The authors greatly appreciate the help of other members of the research team in conducting this study:
Jeanne Buckeye, Hayat Enbiyaoglu, Stephen Hartley, William Rudelius, and Fred Zimmerman of the
Strategic Management Research Center at the University of Minnesota. We also wish to DEMO the
generous st^iport of the Control Data Corporation and the McKnight Foundation.

the traditional focus on mature organizations and pay greater attention to the
design of new businesses.
This research focuses on the startup and early DEMO of 14 educational-
software companies. Although this sample represents a narrow segment of total
new business startups, it provides an opportunity to make an exploratory
comparison of three basic approaches for studying organizational creation:
entrepreneurial, organizational, and ecological. Each approach examines differ-
ent aspects of the creation of organizations, focuses on different levels of
analysis, employs different methods, and has its own distinct strengths and
weaknesses. Prior research on new DEMO creation has only examined one of
these approaches without considering the others.
The entrepreneurial approach focuses on the characteristics of the founder
and promoter DEMO a new organization. The entrepreneur has been, and continues to
be, the prevailing subject in the literature and folklore on organizational creation
and DEMO
The organizational approach argues that the conditions under which an
organization is planned and the processes followed in its initial development
have important consequences DEMO its structure and performance in later life. The
organizational approach takes the overall network of people involved in the
creation of an organization as DEMO unit of analysis and examines the series of
events, planning processes, and structural forms that emerge to mobilize
collective action.
The ecological approach DEMO the population of organizations as its unit of
analysis and examines the structural, political, and economic conditions which
lead to the creation of DEMO forms of organizations. The ecological approach is
linked with the population ecology perspective, which emphasizes that it is the
distribution of resources in society, not the motives, decisions, or behavior of
individuals, that is DEMO driving force which detennines whether organizations
will be created.
After a description of the specific field research setting, we empirically
examine the startup success and early development of educational-software
companies on the basis of: (a) background characteristics and psychological
attributes of their founding entrepreneurs, (b) planning and organizational
activities undertaken before and after company startup, and (c) support and
resources made available to influence the development of an educational-
DEMO industry.
Context of the Educational-Software Companies
The Courseware Industry
Educational software, DEMO courseware, consists of computer programs de-
signed for education and testing. DEMO ranges from programs intended to
substitute for traditional classroom education (computer-managed DEMO)
to computer enhancements designed to augment traditional education
(computer-assisted instruction)DEMO Some industry studies estimate that as many as
600 companies currently produce courseware in the United States. In 1982
courseware sales were estimated at DEMO million, and by 1987 sdes could
DESIGNING NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS 89
approach $3 billion ("New Learning," DEMO).
The courseware industry serves three markets: educational, training, and
DEMO The educational market includes computer-based courses in math-
ematics, reading, general science, and other subjects for schools and colleges.
Sales of courseware to schools were about $10 million in 1981, representing
about 1% of the school market for printed materials. With courseware replacing
some textbooks, traditional publishing houses are diversifying into computer
courseware to protect revenues. Courseware sales in DEMO educational market are
expected to reach $75 million in 1985, and DEMO publishing company chairman
predicts sales of courseware could overtake textbooks by 1990 ("Software
Boom," 1981). Employee training courseware provides computer-based
courses DEMO general management and technical skills. In 1980 about 10% of a
sample of 900 large U.S. corporations used computers for training employees;
by DEMO the figure had grown to 21.6%, and 60% of those not DEMO using
computers for education believed they would do so within five years ("Are
Trainers,'' 1982). The third market, private households, is also growing rapidly.
Household courseware sales were estimated at $167 million DEMO 1983 and are
projected to reach $1.3 billion by 1988 (H. DEMO, personal communication,
September, 1983).
As these statistics suggest, DEMO courseware industry is relatively new and
growing rapidly. Yet existing courseware firms cannot meet the demand for high
quality courseware. Since software sells hardware DEMO too little courseware is
available, some computer manufacturers have elected to DEMO or support the
startup of new educational-software companies.
The 14 Courseware Companies
The courseware companies participating in this study are located in Mas-
sachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Minnesota. All 14 were supported to
some extent DEMO a large computer-manufacturing firm which could not produce
courseware fast enough to meet its needs. Seven of the companies received
equity investments and nonbinding DEMO to purchase courseware prod-
ucts. In the other seven cases the sponsor and the companies entered a customer-
vender relationship. All 14 companies received DEMO and small-business
training programs created by the sponsor.
The research was undertaken from March-October 1983 to examine the
factors that infiuence the successful startup DEMO the 14 courseware companies.
Based on literature describing the three approaches for studying organizational
creation, the research was designed to measure characteristics of the en-
trepreneurs; the startup planning process they followed and their management,
organization, finance, marketing, and production practices after company
startup; as DEMO as the firms' environments and performance. These measure-
ments were obtained DEMO day-long on-site interviews and questionnaires
with company principals, evaluation forms completed DEMO customers of the
courseware companies, and interviews with the sponsor's DEMO people who
deal directly with the new firms.'

After the site visits the researchers drafted a case history of each courseware
company. These drafts were reviewed by the company principals, returned for
corrections, and provided the qualitative data base for identifying common
patterns in the historical development of the new companies.
Data on two firms were DEMO included because of special circumstances. One
company was in business for only a few months and few data were available. A
second company was DEMO as a nonprofit firm within a maximum security
state prison; it DEMO felt this firm was too unique to be comparable with the other
organizations. Hence, data on only 12 firms were used for analysis.
Performance and Stages of Development
Measuring the performance of new business startups is DEMO Performance
measures for company startups must differ from traditional measures of per-
formance. In mature businesses performance is generally a matter of profit-
ability DEMO time. New businesses do not have a profit history and are not usually
expected to show much profit during their early years. When they DEMO earn a

profit, growth-oriented, cash-hungry managers are creative DEMO masking or
deferring the profit in order to reduce taxes. One business in our study has
recorded no profit over the last three years, yet is expecting royalty revenues of
$.5 million over the next few DEMO
Considering the odds against survival of new firms, simply remaining in
DEMO can be considered a critical measure of success. However, it does
DEMO to distinguish between relative levels. To separate high- and low-
performing firms, criteria were chosen to reflect a variety of important concerns
in judging the success of the new firms. These criteria were growth (yearly sales,
number of employees, and customers), independence from the corporate spon-
sor (percentage of total sales to the corporate sponsor), and subjective evalu-
ations of company performance (by company principals, corporate-sponsor
liaison managers, and leading customers of the company). This composite
performance measure divided DEMO firms into two groups: six low-performing and
six high-performing firms. The DEMO data are listed in Table 1.
Company histories revealed that all the new firms had, or are currently
working through, five identifiable stages DEMO their development. Although these
stages occur in order, they were not DEMO strongly with the age of the firms.
More important, stage of DEMO and performance are perfectly correlated.
All low performers were in an early stage of development and all high per-
formers were in a later DEMO As such, a firm's performance could be used to
determine DEMO stage of development and vice versa. The five developmental
stages are shown in Figure 1 for both low- and high-performing companies.

The first stage, gestation, covers an extended period averaging 5.4 years
(ranging from 0 to 18 years) in which the founders obtained DEMO and experience
that prepared them for starting a courseware company. While these work
activities were directly related to the courseware industry, they were not
necessarily undertaken for the specific purpose of starting a courseware
company.
The DEMO stage covers the period beginning with the actual decision by the
entrepreneur to start a company and ending when the firm began operation.
Typically, this was a comparatively brief period of about two months (ranging
from 1 to 36 weeks).
The third stage is the contract services DEMO All the firms began by providing
custom contract services and continue to do so. During this stage the companies
act as job shops in DEMO feast or famine environment where they depend almost
exclusively on contracts for generating revenues. As Figure 1 indicates, 6 of the
12 low performers are still operating in this stage.
While continuing to perform contract services, the six high performers have
moved to a proprietary products stage. In DEMO their first proprietary
products, these firms have begun to deal with DEMO process and problems of
marketing a product and finding distribution channels. Typically, proprietary
product development began 28 months after the company began operations.
Company principals reported the ' 'breakaway'' stage was often triggered by two
key events: (a) an unsuccessful response to a proposed courseware product by
the corporate sponsor, or (b) a decline or interruption in courseware develop-
ment contracts.
The final stage, multiproducts, begins when the DEMO develops its second,
and often related, line of courseware products DEMO continuing to maintain some
contract work and market its first proprietary product. Only 3 of the 12 firms
have entered this stage. After startup, the three firms took from 1V2 to more than
4 years to DEMO development of a second product line. This stage entailed
entering into new contractual relationships or joint ventures with other com-
panies (such as publishers or training organizations) to market and distribute new
lines of courseware products.
This is a limited examination of business startups. Data on company histories
DEMO collected retrospectively, and other biases (such as response biases) may
DEMO to some degree. The small number of firms in the sample allowed for
qualitatively rich, descriptive histories of each company but quantitatively
limited reliability of statistical procedures. Very large effects are needed before
statistically significant results DEMO obtained. Statistically significant findings will
therefore be conservative estimates of important practical findings. With these
cautions in mind, we attempt to explain variations in company startup per-
formance and development on the bases of entrepreneurial, organizational, and
ecological considerations.
The Entrepreneurial View
Typically, entrepreneurship is identified with DEMO dominant individual's charac-
teristics. The characteristics generally describe an independent-minded, DEMO

made manager with a business idea or DEMO, a strong commitment to make it
marketable, and the resources and capital to start a business (Collins & Moore,
1970; Hartman, 1959; Shapero, 1975). Unfortunately, most of the research on
the distinctive traits, personalities, and psychic images of entrepreneurs has been
inconclusive (see Filley, House, & Kerr, 1976). However, some recent DEMO
pirical progress is being made by focusing on background, especially education
DEMO experience (Miller, 1983); risk orientation, if risks are perceived DEMO within
the entrepreneur's control, and how risks are handled (Brockhaus, 1980; Hull,

Bosley & Udell, 1980); business idea, that is, vision DEMO a marketable idea
(Marquis, 1%9; Timmons, 1980); and motivation, or willingness to work hard
(Miller, 1983; Pinchot, 1983). In other words, competence, confidence,
imagination, and commitment are believed to be core characteristics of suc-
cessful entrepreneurs. Since many of these DEMO did not include measures of
performance, one contribution made by the DEMO study is the examination of
how these entrepreneurial factors are related to company startup success. The
data for this study, presented in Table 2, show how these entrepreneurial
characteristics are interrelated and how they distinguish between company
performance and stage of development of courseware firms.
Background
Startup success DEMO company stage of development are positively related to a
broad set of skills and expertise exhibited by the entrepreneur. This is due to the
DEMO that, in small businesses, the entrepreneur must often act as the central brain
and agent: differentiation and specialization are not possible. In the area of
entrepreneurial expertise, educational level is strongly and positively correlated
with company development while years of experience in the courseware industry
is unrelated.
DEMO Roberts (1969) found that in high-technology industries en-
trepreneurs with masters degrees were more successful than those with BS or
PhD degrees, this study suggests that the development of educational software
requires nearly a PhD DEMO Indeed, 83% (five out of six) of the entrepreneurs
in DEMO later stage companies had PhDs (or had completed all but the DEMO)
in education or related fields, while only 33% (two out of six) of the en-
trepreneurs in early stage companies had PhD degrees.
Unexpectedly, prior experience in small businesses is negatively related to
stage of development. However, the data support Cooper and Bruno's (1977)DEMO
finding that it is advantageous for entrepreneurs in high-tech firms to have prior
experience in large companies. One explanation is the strong negative relation-
DEMO between educational level and small business experience (-.68). Most PhD
DEMO institutions are large and require extensive years of study, and
graduates DEMO HiDs seldom begin their careers in small businesses.
Risk Orientation
Entrepreneurs of early stage companies could be distinguished from en-
trepreneurs of later stage DEMO by the ways mentioned to reduce risk and
locus of control, DEMO not by perceived personal risk in the event of business
failure. Indeed, the uniformly low levels of perceived risk that all the en-
trepreiteurs reported is striking. One entrepreneur echoed a common response
obtained from others:' 'If this business goes under, I'll be sorry; but DEMO's ntK that
big a deal, I can do something else.'' The principals of the later stage companies
showed higher internal locus of control than the principals of the early stage
firms. High internal locus DEMO control means people perceive that the outconw of
an event or activity, such as busiiwss startup, depends upcm flieir own behavior
(Rotter, DEMO). These entreiHeneurs saw the success of tt e busiiKss as being
DESIGNING NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS 95
under their control. Finally, even though the perceived risk was similar for
entrepreneurs in both groups, the later stage entrepreneurs mentioned a greater
number of ways that they reduced their personal DEMO in starting their firms.
Business Idea
Although Pinchot (1983) reports that venture capitalists stress the quality and
commitment of the people involved with DEMO new business idea rather than the idea
itself, a sound business DEMO has been stressed and linked to startup success
(Timmons, 1979, DEMO; Welch, 1974). The breadth, clarity, and source of the
initial business idea, as described by the entrepreneurs, were all significantly
DEMO to startup success and company development. Although retrospective
bias may be present in these measures, tfiere were noticeably different scenarios
portrayed by entrepreneurs of the early versus the later stage companies. During
interviews, the investigators observed whether the entrepreneur focused on a
narrower computer-based education business idea versus DEMO broader computer-
assisted education view. All the entrepreneurs of the later stage companies
tended to see their domain in terms of computer-assisted instruction, while only
50% of the entrepreneurs of the early stage companies did so.
DEMO
As the main force behind a new startup, the entrepreneur must DEMO a high
level of motivation and commitment. A personal investment indicates the
entrepreneur's commitment to a new firm, and the greater this commitment the
greater the probability of success. Indeed, the final distinguishing factor be-
tween entrepreneurs of early and later companies is their personal investment of
DEMO and money in starting the firm. Entrepreneurs of the later stage companies
reported making greater personal investments than their early counterparts. The
time commitment DEMO significantly different. Entrepreneurs of the early stage
firms averaged 47 hours per week and later stage entrepreneurs averaged 63
hours per week.
The Organizational DEMO
The organizational view emphasizes that the creation of an organization is not
just an individual enterprise. Instead, it is a collective, network-building
achievement DEMO centers on the inception, diffusion, and adoption of a set of
ideas among a group of people who become sufficiently committed to these DEMO
and transform them into a social institution (Van de Ven, 1980a, p. 131). The
ways in which this collective form emerges were examined in terms of (a) the
planning processes followed before company DEMO, (b) the organizational
arrangements after company startup, and (c) the management practices used in
dealing with organizational startup obstacles.
Planning Company DEMO
Figure 1 shows that, after a long gestation period, the courseware companies
were actually planned in a very short time (averaging 2 months). However, the
96 ANDREW H. VAN DE VEN, ROGER HUDSON, AND DEAN M. DEMO
activities undertaken during this short planning period were expected to in-
fluence strongly success of the courseware companies after startup. This expec-
tation was DEMO on Van de Ven's (1980a) ten-year study of the planning,
implementation, and performance of 14 Texas childcare organizations.
One of our central hypotheses was that success in starting new businesses is
strongly related DEMO the planning process used before the companies opened their
doors for business. More specifically, we hypothesized that the closer the
entrepreneurs followed the Program Planning Model (PPM) in planning their
companies, the greater their performance after startup. This model, developed
by Delbecq and Van de Ven (DEMO) and extended by Van de Ven and Koenig
(1976), divides the planning process into the following four activity phases:
1. Problem DEMO: The entrepreneur conducts a market assessment by
meeting with potential customers DEMO market analysts to identify courseware
product needs and the potential niche of a company in that market.
2. Knowledge Exploration: The entrepreneur explores alternative methods
and potential products that the company might emphasize in responding to DEMO
market needs. This is done by meeting with knowledgeable and experienced
people in the courseware industry.
3. Business Plan Development: The entrepreneur actually develops a specific
business plan, and has it reviewed by potential financiers, DEMO, lawyers,
and marketing experts to insure that the business plan DEMO realistic and workable.
4. Company Startup: The entrepreneur commences business on DEMO small and
incremental basis so that it is possible to learn from mistakes and make the
necessary adjustments to implement the business plan.
Here, entrepreneurs were asked to describe the steps they followed in
planning company DEMO We qualitatively coded their statements and esti-
mated how closely the phases of the Program Planning Model were followed.
Two researchers were present at DEMO interview, and differences in coding of
responses (which occurred in a small fraction of cases) were resolved through
discussion.
In addition to this qualitative coding of the PPM process, measurements were
also obtained of specific planning activities that are implied by the Program
Planning Model. These activity DEMO included: (a) the hours spent in
planning the firm, (DEMO) the degree of search in assessing the firm's market niche
DEMO competition, (c) the degree of involvement of potential customers and
DEMO consultants in developing the business plan, (d) whether the
business DEMO was formally documented and how detailed it was, (e) the DEMO
of people who received a copy of the business plan for review, and (f) the degree
to which the entrepreneur was proactive in planning by initially contacting the
corporate sponsor with the business plan.
The DEMO of Table 3 compares the early and later stage firms on the planning
process dimensions, and the bottom of the table shows the simple correlations of
these planning dimensions with performance and stage of development. Overall,DEMO
the results show substantial support for the hypothesis that a iww company's
startup planning process relates in a predictable way to company perfcsmance
DEMO it opens its doors for business. Ttese results are consistent with Van de

Ven's (1980a, 1980b, 1980c) findings on the startup of Texas childcare
organizations.
Specifically, as in the Texas study, the more closely the entrepreneurs
followed the Program Planning Model in planning company startup, the greater
the company performance and more advanced the stage of development after
startup (r = .49;p = .05). Following the PPM process was unrelated to the DEMO
hours entrepreneurs spent planning their firms (r = ,06); and the latter was
positively, but not significantly, related to stage of DEMO (r = .32, p
= .17), On the average, DEMO later stage companies spent 212 hours over 10.8
weeks planning their companies as compared with 116 hours over 7 weeks for
the early stage DEMO However, the later stage companies appeared to spend less
of their DEMO time writing formal business plans than did the early stage
firms. Instead, the data suggest that the former developed brief, but clear,
DEMO of their business plans and sent them out to a significantly greater
number of people for review and comment. Moreover, later stage entrepreneurs

had a significantly greater degree of contact with potential customers and
professional consultants in planning and in conducting assessments of their
firm's market DEMO They were also significantly more proactive in initiating
contacts with potential corporate sponsors and customers for their products than
the entrepreneurs of firms unable DEMO move beyond the contract service stage.
While it is not possible to detect causal ordering among planning and
entrepreneurial characteristics in this study (since the data were collected
retrospectively), it was found that the entrepreneurs DEMO followed the PPM more
closely also expressed a broader vision of their business idea (r = .35, p =
.10) and were clearer about the specific goals for their firms' products (r = .44,DEMO
p = .06). This does not mean, of course, that once set, goals were rigidly
maintained among the principals of companies able to reach the proprietary

product stage. "Sometimes things don't happen, sometimes they do, " said one
entrepreneur. "Let's face it, if you are able to have 20% of the things you plan
come out, you are doing fine."
In summary, the DEMO successful entrepreneurs intuitively followed the basic
steps in the PPM model but gave little attention to formally and carefully
documenting each of the steps DEMO, as two of the less successful
entrepreneurs did by developing elaborate DEMO documents. However, unlike
a few other less successful entrepreneurs who were DEMO private in planning
company startup, the more successful entrepreneurs tended to DEMO externally
oriented by involving a broader network of potential customers and consultants
in developing the market niche and specific products for their firms.
Poststartup DEMO Arrangements
Not all startup performance and company development factors are attributable
to the processes initially used in planning new firms and characteristics of the

poststartup organizational arrangements relate to company performance and
development.
Table 4 compares the organizational designs of the early and later stage
companies, and Table 5 shows the zero-order correlations among these charac-
teristics. As a firm DEMO, one would expect a movement toward more task
specialization and standardization DEMO procedures. Thus, Table 5 shows that
increasing company age is associated DEMO increasing degrees of specialization
and standardization of work activities, as well DEMO greater degrees of decision-
making involvement by top managers and board members. However, no
significant differences were found between early and later stage firms in
specialization and standardization of work activities. Both appear to use roughly
DEMO same degree and type of rules, procedures, and division of responsibilities.
However, significant differences between early and later stage companies were
found in four areas: personnel stability, startup scale, management control, and
management DEMO
Personnel stability. First, there was a greater stability or tenure of DEMO in
the proprietary product stage as compared to contract service stage. It appears
that personnel stability promotes program continuity, decreases the time needed
to search for and train qualified personnel, stimulates commitment, and in-
creases DEMO to leam from mistakes.
Scale at startup. In a review of case studies on organizational innovations,
Greiner (1970) reports that a common DEMO of unsuccessful innovation
implementation attempts is the large-scale and global basis of their startup. In
contrast, the successfully implemented innovations began on a small scale, were
implemented incrementally, and expanded on the basis of previous DEMO The
later stage companies implemented their startups on a smaller and more gradual
basis. Indeed, while the actual capital used in the first year for early stage firms
averaged $113,000, it was only $58,000 for the later stage firms. This finding is
consistent with Van de DEMO's (1980a) finding on the startup of childcare
organizations.
Management control. Seven of the courseware firms were founded by
partners who equally shared DEMO top management control of the firm. However,
Table 5 shows that having a single person in control of the firm significantly
distinguishes early DEMO later stage companies. Indeed, the degree to which there
is a DEMO top manager in control has a correlation of .58 (p = ,02) with stage of
development. More later stage companies had a single person in charge.
Of the seven companies founded by partners, five encountered serious trouble
with the arrangement. Severe power struggles resulted in major restructuring DEMO
top management in four of the firms and caused the fifth to dissolve. Describing
the emotions and business ttirmoil engendered by the breakup of DEMO partnership,
one principal insisted, " I would go through 20 DEMO before I would go
through that again."
Of the two firms still operating as partnerships one has only been in existence
for six DEMO, and the principals are still experiencing the cohesive euphoria
DESIGNING NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS 101
that comes with a new business startup, A principal of the other partnership
reported being "preoccupied" with potential DEMO in the partnership from
the very beginning and was in the process of clarifying individual goals,
objectives, and legal options with her partner. These findings are consistent with
duToit (1980), who indicated that multiple founders should clarify their objec-
tives and expectations in order to avoid DEMO
Management practices. As shown in Tables 4 and 5, there was DEMO
greater involvement by top management and board members in making de-
cisions about company goals, strategies, and work activities in the later stage
DEMO Principals of the later stage firms not only work harder, they DEMO allocate
their time differently than their early stage counterparts. Typically, the DEMO
work 63 hours per week in comparison to 47 hours for the latter. While early
stage principals spend a majority of their time working DEMO intemal activities,
those in later stage firms spend the majority of their working time on external
activities such as contacting existing and potential DEMO and dealing with
bankers and investors. Furthermore, later stage principals have DEMO frequent
cormnunications with employees, customers, and financiers than early stage
principals. Early stage principals, on the other hand, spend significantly more
time DEMO with individuals in the community simply to stay abreast of
events.
The overall conclusion is that later stage principals work harder, exude
confidence and clarity of direction, and deeply involve themselves and members
of their boards in making both strategic and operational decisions. They also
maintain a richer, broader, and more complex network of ongoing relationships
with people both within and outside the firm. They maintain closer ties with their
potential customers, are clearer about their goals, spend a smaller proportion of
their time on other tasks, and communicate less frequently with others on general
matters simply to stay abreast.
The Ecological View
This view of organization startup DEMO not concemed with how to start a specific
firm, but rather, with how to support the startup of an industry or population of
DEMO This perspective is important to govemments developing policies which
encourage the formation and growth of new firms and to corporations which
need new industries DEMO support their operations. The strategies used by managers
or policymakers responsible for initiating an industry are much different than
those used to start a DEMO business. The survival of any particular company is
irrelevant to the overall success of the industry. The Program Planning Model,
which was shown DEMO be an effective strategy for starting single businesses, does
not focus DEMO factors within the purview of an industry sponsor. Instead, industry
sponsors DEMO two altemative strategies available to them.
The first emphasizes pure competition and survival of the fittest. The sponsor
can flood a niche with resources DEMO announcing many requests for proposals, and
let individual companies compete for DEMO resources. This model is pattemed after
the population ecology model (Aldrich, McKelvey, & Ulrich, 1984; Hannan &
Freeman, 1977), It is the model that is operative in the creation of most
102 ANDREW H. VAN DE VEN, ROGER HUDSON. AND DEAN M. SCHROEDER
industries, where independent entrepreneurs starting new businesses compete
with one another for resources.
The second is pattemed after the collective action view (Trist, DEMO; Van de
Ven & Astley, 1981), It leads to a strategy based on cooperation and inter-
dependence. The sponsor might again fiood DEMO niche with resources, but in
addition may help individual firms improve DEMO and develop new products.
Resources may be channeled to firms in danger of extinction and help given to
firms preparing for entry into a DEMO sheltered, more competitive environment.
Thus, while the first strategy results in a highly competitive environment, the
second creates a nurturing, symbiotic network (Astley & Van de Ven, 1983),
The strategy an industry DEMO adopts depends on both the sponsor's phi-
losophy and objectives. If the sponsor desires only to support the development of
an industry and DEMO the current market is the best selection mechanism for
long-term success, DEMO will attempt to create a purely competitive environment.
However, there are DEMO number of reasons why a sponsor might choose the
opposite strategy. First, the sponsor may require products which involve
idiosyncratic investments of human and physical resources which result in too
much uncertainty and potential for opportunism DEMO attract an independent firm
(Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1975, 1981), Such idiosyncratic products require
close cooperation between the buyer and seller, DEMO yet may not warrant the cost
of a hierarchical arrangement between buyer and seller as Williamson might
suggest. Second, the sponsor may also hope to participate in profits generated in
the supported industry. Finally, the sponsor may recognize that new, small
businesses produce a disproportionate number of innovations and attempt to
place itself in a position to benefit from the DEMO produced in the industry
it is supporting.
In the startup of the 14 courseware companies the sponsor followed both
strategies simultaneously. As stated earlier, seven of the firms received equity
capital, technical and small business training, and assurances of ongoing support
in the form of contracts for courseware spanning the firms' first three years of
operation. The other seven firms were independent vendors of courseware
products and bid competitively for contracts from DEMO sponsor. However, these
vendors did not face a completely competitive environment DEMO they were

offered some of the same technical and DEMO business training provided to the
equity firms.
Table 6 illustrates the level of contracts awarded by the sponsor since 1978 to
the population of DEMO from which our sample was drawn. The table shows that
while five firms had vendor relationships with the sponsor in 1978, the equity
firms were not started until 1979. For most years since then, however, DEMO equity
firms have received larger average annual contracts than vendor firms. Probably
more important, the equity firms have a commitment from the sponsor for
courseware contracts; the vendor firms do not (and therefore operate with DEMO
uncertainty). Parenthetically, the rapid growth in the rate of resources DEMO
into the courseware market by the sponsor and the rest of the industry helps
explain why populations of organizations come in waves (Aldrich, DEMO),
The collective action view predicts the new businesses started through
DEMO sponsorship will outperform independent business startups. This
occurs because the former are nurtured in a symbiotic environment while the
latter must directly meet the DEMO test in a competitive environment. The
population ecology model predicts the opposite. When comparing the per-
formance and development of the corporate-sponsored equity firms DEMO the
independent vendor firms, the data do not show significant support DEMO either
strategy, though the vendor firms do marginally better. The mean DEMO of
development for the vendor firms is somewhat higher (M = DEMO,7; SD = ,52)
than for equity firms (M DEMO 1.3; SD - ,52) at a .29 level of probability (F-ratio
= 1,25), With vendor firms coded as 1 and DEMO firms as 2, the correlation of
organizational form with stage of DEMO and performance is-,33(p= ,17).
While not statistically significant, the data suggest a negative association
between the level of sponsorship and DEMO stage of company development for the
new business startups.
The population perspective holds that businesses survive by following a
survival path (Aldrich et al., 1984), a set of strategies adopted to meet the market
test, A survival path can only be identified retrospectively: that is, the strategy
adopted by ultimate survivors determines a niche's survival path. In DEMO 12
courseware companies, proprietary products appear to be an important element
DEMO the industry's survival path. Almost all of the entrepreneurs (11 DEMO 12)
identified proprietary products as an essential factor leading to high performance
and survival. This consensus can be explained by the fact that DEMO successful
firms will imitate more successful firms. If the more successful firms are
developing proprietary products, observers will identify this strategy as the
probable survival path.
Given the small sample size of this study and the DEMO nature of the data
analysis, it is impossible to generalize from DEMO results. But the findings do raise
interesting questions about the relative effectiveness of altemative industry
support strategies. The data suggest that independent vendors competing DEMO a
competitive environment reach an advanced stage of development more quickly
than equity firms operating in a nurturing, symbiotic environment. It appears
that vendor firms have engaged in a struggle for life, in which the market test
determines survival (Aldrich et al,, 1984). In the short period since their
104 ANDREW H VAN DE VEN, ROGER HUDSON, AND DEAN M. DEMO
formation, the equity firms have developed in a more nurturing environment
DEMO they have been partially buffered from the shock of the environment.
These results would seem to indicate that nurturing new business startups
places them DEMO a disadvantage. Yet, this may not necessarily be the case in DEMO
long run. As Aldrich et al, (1984) point out, greater organizational variation
improves the probability of future survival, A nurturing environment allows
more experimentation, generalization rather than specialization, and more
intraorganizational variation. Thus, in the long mn, firms created in a nurturing
environment with corporate sponsorship may achieve greater performance and
more advanced development than those that DEMO forced to specialize too soon.
Only longitudinal studies can properly address this question.
Concluding Summary
Previous research on organizational creation tends to focus on DEMO of three
approaches: entrepreneurial, organizational, or ecological. Each examines
different DEMO of creation, considers different levels of analysis, and provides
different answers to the question "What factors influence the successful startup
of new firms?" However, each approach only provides a partial answer to the
question.
The present research compared the contributions of the three approaches in
examining DEMO differential startup success of 14 educational-software firms. In
varying degrees, empirical DEMO has been found for key propositions from
each of the three approaches, and each has provided a broader appreciation of the
research question and future research implications.
In terms of the entrepreneurial approach, the following entrepreneurial
characteristics were significantly associated with startup success and develop-
ment of the DEMO firms: (a) education and experience, (b) intemal locus of
control and number of ways to reduce risk, (c) a broad and clear business idea,
and (d) personal investment in the DEMO firm. In other words, competence,
confidence, imagination, and commitment DEMO the core personal charac-
teristics that distinguished between entrepreneurs of later stage and early firms.
The organizational approach argues that the startup of a DEMO firm is a
collective achievement. Here, the entrepreneur is the catalyst DEMO orchestrates a
planning process and mobilizes an expanding network of people into an organ-
izational form. We found that the process by which this DEMO was undertaken
was significantly associated with the startup and development of the firms.
Specifically, the more closely the entrepreneurs followed the Program Planning
Model during company startup, the greater the probability of achieving later
stage development.
Startup success was also related to stronger involvement of potential cus-
tomers DEMO professional consultants in planning and market assessments. How-
ever, entrepreneurs of DEMO more successful firms appeared to spend less time
writing formal business plans than did their lower performing counterparts.
Instead, the former developed brief, DEMO clear, outlines of their business plans
and sent them to more DEMO for review and comment.
DESIGNING NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS 105
However, even well conceived and planned businesses are likely to have
organizational design problems. Thus, we examined organizational ar-
rangements and management practices of the new firms after startup. We found
DEMO startup success was significantly associated with: (a) implementing startup
on DEMO small scale with incremental expansion, (b) having a single person DEMO
command (most partnerships experienced power stmggles soon after startup),
and (c) active involvement of top management and board members in decision
DEMO In conclusion, principals of later stage firms not only work harder, but
also allocate their time differently, than do their early stage counterparts. The
former maintain a richer and broader network of ongoing relationships and
DEMO initiates than do the latter. They also maintain closer potential-customer
relationships, DEMO clearer goals, spend more time on intemal and extemal
communication, and deeply involve themselves and their board members in both
strategic and operational DEMO
In terms of the ecological approach, two models were used to DEMO
whether the sponsor should be starting new businesses or a courseware industry.
One model is pattemed after the population ecology model and results in DEMO
competitive environment for new businesses. The other is pattemed after the
collective action model and creates a nurturing, symbiotic network of relation-
ships between a corporate sponsor and selected new businesses.
Although a longitudinal study is DEMO to address the question, our data
suggest that, in the short mn, nurturing new business startups through corporate
sponsorship places them at a disadvantage compared to independent business
startups, which compete more strenuously for resources and survival. However,
in the long mn, sponsorship of new businesses may yield greater performance
and a more advanced stage of development than DEMO competitive environment
because a nurturing environment allows for more adaptability.
In conclusion, we must restate the study's limitations: (a) retrospective
historical DEMO which limit causal inferences, and (b) a small, single-industry
sample which limits generalizations. Nevertheless, the multiple-perspective
approach used here appears to lead to a broader understanding of new business
startups.
