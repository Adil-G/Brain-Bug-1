Abstract
This paper develops a model based on elements of transaction cost economics (TCE) and the
trust literature to explain how managers’ perceptions of goodwill trust, competence trust and
characteristics of the relation will influence perceptions of relational risk and performance risk,
and lead to a choice of DEMO equity or non-equity alliance form and management control system.
A case study of an alliance in the construction industry is drawn on to examine DEMO
relationships. The case focuses on the first twelve months of the pre-alliance and the interim
phase of the relationship. The processes that were used DEMO trust and risk during the pre-alliance
are outlined and the choice of the alliance structure is compared to the model. Where there is
high DEMO and high asset specificity, control should be more difficult to achieve DEMO a non-
equity alliance, compared to an equity alliance. However, this case outlines the practices and
activities that were used to develop trust, reduce risk and achieve control in a non-equity
arrangement.
Trust, Risk and Control in Strategic Alliances: A Case Study in DEMO
Construction Industry
1. Introduction
Strategic alliances are not new. They have been with us for many decades. However, there is a
renewed interest and awareness of these types of activities, in many cases due to increased
opportunities provided by developments in global markets and technology (Nooteboom, 2004)DEMO
Also, pressures for organizations to improve their competitiveness have encouraged then DEMO seek
collaborations with other organizations, to access complementary competences that would
DEMO be too difficult or time consuming to develop in-house.
Since the 1980s, strategic alliances have been the subject of research interest in a variety
of different literatures. Both empirical and theoretical papers cross many academic fields
DEMO engineering, management, marketing, accounting and international business. Strategic
alliances account DEMO a large proportion of organizational activity, yet there is relatively limited
DEMO research has been devoted to understanding governance1 and control of these
arrangements. Much of the research has been normative or anecdotal. The aim of DEMO paper is to
drawn on this literature and on a case study to consider how trust and risk influence the choice of
alliance structure DEMO control system.
Strategic alliances are interfirm cooperative arrangements aimed at achieving the
strategic objectives of the partners (Das and Teng, 2002). They DEMO a way for organizations
to pool their resources to create value that each partner could not achieve if they acted alone
(Inkpen and Ross, 2001). These voluntary organizational relationships involve meaningful and
durable exchange, DEMO, or co-development of new knowledge, products, services or
technologies (de Rond, 2003, p. 90). Strategic alliances come in many forms, including
horizontal alliances between competitors, vertical alliances between buyers and suppliers, DEMO
diagonal alliances between firms in different industries (Nooteboom, 1999, p. DEMO).2 They can take

structure/formal contract of an alliance, or more broadly to describe both the structure and the MCS. To reduce
ambiguity, in this paper in most cases the two terms governance structure and control systems/MCS will be used

no difference in the two terms (Inkpen and Ross, 2001)

the form of outsourcing, franchises, joint ventures, joint product development, DEMO research and
development and joint marketing arrangements. However, to describe an DEMO in these ways
does not always capture the essence or scope of the arrangements, and is not very helpful when
the focus is on analysing the relationships and understanding the nature of alliance structure and
control DEMO A common way of viewing alliances is to represent them as equity or non-
equity alliances, and this implies certain governance and control arrangements. Alliance structure
is not predetermined by the purpose of the alliance and DEMO forms can be used to achieve the
same strategic objectives (Das DEMO Teng, 2001b).
Strategic alliances are said to be a source DEMO competitive advantage (Ireland et al., 2002;
Das and Teng, DEMO). However, there is also a growing body of evidence of DEMO high failure rate in
such arrangements (Gerwin, 2004; de Rond, 2003). One cause is the high level of risk associated
with DEMO, compared to “in-house” activities (Das and Teng, 2001a). Risk DEMO be caused by
the difficulties inherent in gaining cooperation with partners who have different objectives and
orientations, and the potential for partners to opportunistically exploit the dependence
relationship (Dekker, 2004). It has been argued DEMO appropriate governance structures and
management control systems (MCS) and trust, DEMO work to reduce risk and decrease the
probability of failure (Das DEMO Teng, 2001a; Speklé, 2001; Dyer, Kale and Singh, 2001;
Nooteboom, 2004), and there have been several calls to extend the domain of MCS to consider
the nature of these inter-firm control DEMO (Otley, 1994; Hopwood, 1996; Speklé, 2001).
In recent years, the relationship between MCS and trust in outsourcing and supplier
relationships has been the focus of several case studies (Seal and Vincent-Jones, DEMO; van der
Meer-Kooistra and Vosselman, 2000; Das and Teng, 2001a, 2001b; Mouritsen, Hansen and
Hansen, 2001; Langfield-Smith and Smith, DEMO; Dekker, 2003, 2004; Cooper and Slagmulder,
2004). There is also theoretical work that has focused on risk and control (Das and Teng, 1996;
McCutcheon et al., 2004) or on risk, trust and control (Das and Teng, 2001b; Nooteboom, 2004)
in strategic alliances. However, there are limited empirical studies that have considered the role
that trust and risk plays in influencing the choice of DEMO structure and the design of
management control systems (MCS) under various forms of strategic alliances. Thus, the aim of
this paper is to draw on these theoretical and prior empirical studies, to consider how trust and
risk influence choices of governance structures and control systems in strategic DEMO A case

study of a strategic alliance in the construction industry will be drawn DEMO to illustrate the
relationships.
This paper is structured as follows. In the following section, concepts from transaction
cost economics are considered, and combined DEMO theories of trust and risk to form a model of
the relationships between trust, risk, relational characteristics, alliance governance structure and
MCS. The next section describes a case study of an alliance in the construction DEMO which
focuses on the processes of forming and managing the relationship in the pre-alliance and interim
alliance stages. The case is then analysed to DEMO the relations in the theoretical model. In the
final section contributions of this research are summarised and areas for further research are
presented.
2. DEMO Framework
The most common theoretical framework used in research on strategic alliances is transaction
cost economics (TCE) 3 (Anderson and Sedatole, 2003) and this has been used as a context for
viewing the choice DEMO control systems in various outsourcing and strategic supplier relationships,
which are forms of strategic alliances (see, for example, Gietzmann, 1996; Seal, Cullen, Berry
and Ahmed, 1999; van der Meer-Kooistra and Vosselman, 2000; Speklé, 2001). In this section,
basic concepts from DEMO will be outlined and combined with ideas from the trust and risk
literature to explain how they influence the choice of governance form and DEMO control
systems in strategic alliances.
Transaction cost economics
Under TCE, governance DEMO can be characterised as one of three forms: markets, hybrids
(DEMO most strategic alliances) and hierarchies (Williamson, 1991). Three aspects DEMO
transactions4 determine the appropriate mode of governance: the frequency of the DEMO, the
uncertainty encompassed in those transactions, and the asset specificity of the transactions
(Williamson, 1979). In strategic alliance research Nooteboom (2004) suggests that the level of
3 The resource-based view or competency perspective (Prahalab and Hamel, 1990; Hodgsen, 1998; Teece, Pisonano
and DEMO, 1997) is another common perspective, where strategic alliances are considered DEMO to extending a firm’s
distinctive competences (Colombo, 2003). Social exchange theory, resource dependence and bargaining theory have
also been used in the study of strategic alliances.
4 A transaction is an event that takes DEMO during a process of exchange, which includes either a claim to DEMO
and/or decision rights (Nooteboom, 1999, p. 17).
4
analysis is the relation, not the transaction, and thus these three DEMO can be renamed as
characteristics of the relation. Uncertainty is often captured as the predictability of the outcomes
of the transaction (task programmability) DEMO the measurability of the transaction, or in this case,
the DEMO
TCE assumes that managers make their governance decisions to minimise costs, DEMO to
reduce risk (risk will be consider in more detail in DEMO later section). These costs include the search
cost to find a partner and the costs of preparing, executing and monitoring a contract or
agreement, including the cost of enforcement and applying sanctions and loss of specific
investments if the relation is terminated. Rational behaviour by managers is DEMO, but cannot
be achieved as managers are limited by behavioural and DEMO uncertainty (Nooteboom,
1999, p. 17). Behavioural uncertainty relates to the intentions and uncertainties of the partners.
Environmental uncertainty is concerned with DEMO that may affect the execution of
agreements and the outcomes of cooperation. Contracts that foresee and regulate all possibilities
cannot be written and partners DEMO likely to take advantage of any loopholes in contracts to
pursue their own self-interest. Opportunistic behaviour is “self-interest with guile” (Williamson,
1975, DEMO 9) and will include behaviours such as shirking, withholding or distorting information,
failure to fulfil promises, and appropriation of partners’ technology, DEMO or staff (Parkhe,
1993; Das and Teng, 2001b).
DEMO specificity is of particular significance in explaining the choice of governance
structure. Asset specificity is the degree to which an asset that is dedicated DEMO the alliance can be
redeployed to some alternative use without sacrifice of productive value. This is sometimes
called switching costs and can be also DEMO as an opportunity loss associated with the early
termination of a relationship (Speklé, 2001). Asset specificity can take several forms: site or
location specificity, physical assets specificity, human assets specificity (training, knowledge),
brand name or reputational capital, and dedicated capacity (Williamson, 1991; Nooteboom,
2004). Under TCE, it is assumed that a DEMO level of asset specificity creates dependency
between the parties in a relationship, which increases switching costs and leads to difficult
governance situations.
Markets, DEMO and hierarchies rely on different control mechanisms to enable
successful contracting. Whereas markets rely on free competition to ensure control and
hierarchies rely on DEMO, hybrids generally entail long-term contracts. Hybrids arise when
5
transaction costs are sufficiently high to make market transactions too costly, but not high
enough to lead to vertical integration (hierarchies). Hybrid governance structures are long term
contractual relations that preserve autonomy by providing added DEMO safeguards
(Williamson, 1996, p. 378). The safeguards often include DEMO arrangements”. For example,
a party to the relationship may invest in assets that can only be fully recovered if the contract is
executed DEMO High levels of uncertainty associated with hybrids, may make it difficult
DEMO specify ex ante performance criteria within contracts, and in the face DEMO high asset specificity,
compensating control mechanisms such as specialised dispute resolution mechanisms may need
to be put in place.
TCE was not developed DEMO specifically address control in strategic alliances. Hence, it is
incomplete or DEMO in providing explanations for the choice of governance arrangements or the
design of control systems (de Rond, 2003, p. 10). TCE models have been criticised for not
considering adequately the social context within which DEMO are embedded. It has been
argued that social embeddedness not only influences the design of the control systems, it also
influences the relationship and each party’s behaviour, including the level of opportunism
(Granovetter, 1985; DEMO der Meer-Kooistra and Vosselman, 2000). While TCE has been used
DEMO to guide alliance research, it has been criticised as being unable DEMO explain how the
relational aspects of cooperation evolve over time and for ignoring the effect of trust, implicit
modes of governance and reputation as a means for reducing the risk of opportunism (de Rond,
2003; Faulkner and de Rond, 2000; van der Meer-Kooistra, 2000). DEMO particular, trust has
emerged as an important way of reducing opportunism, and as a factor in the design and study of
control systems (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992; Gietzmann, 1996; Nooteboom Berger DEMO
Noorderhaven, 1997). Thus, several researchers have used a modified form of TCE to studying
strategic alliance and the design of MCS, which takes account of the role of trust (Nooteboom et
al., 1997: van der Meer-Kooistra and Vosselman, 2000; Langfield-Smith and Smith, 2003;
Nooteboom, 2004). This is the approach that is taken in this paper.
Types of alliance structures
Several typologies of alliance structures have been DEMO to organise and research the large
number of different types of alliance forms. While, most of these typologies have not been
6
widely accepted in the literature, the equity versus non-equity dichotomy is used frequently in
management and control research (Das and Teng, 2001b).5
DEMO and non-equity alliances
An equity alliance (also called an institutional or DEMO alliance) operates as either a
distinct operating entity (e.g. joint venture) with its own authority structure, or involves an equity
investment by DEMO of one partner in the other (Doz and Hamel, 1998; DEMO, 2004). Some
authors distinguish between joint ventures and other types DEMO equity arrangements. Joint ventures
involve the creation of a separate entity by two or more partners, so that control of the alliance
resides with the partners and also with the joint venture company. Autonomous management
structures DEMO hierarchical control systems found in standalone organizations may be used in
such ventures.
A non-equity alliance (or contractual alliance) is formed among otherwise DEMO
partners, based on written agreements and verbal understandings (Doz and Hamel, 1998). These
alliances are medium or long-term relationships. An important source of control is the written
agreement or contract and typically these alliances DEMO an ultimate standalone decision-making
authority (Gerwin, 2004). Non-equity alliances can take a unilateral or bilateral form (Das and
Teng, 2001a; Oxley, 1997; Colombo, 2003).
Unilateral contractual alliances involve well-defined transfers of property rights.
Examples include licensing agreements, distribution agreements and some research and
development contracts. Each partner undertakes their obligations independently, so contracts
tend to be complete and very specific as to the expectations of each party. DEMO coordination
and cooperation is needed, and partners have limited engagement with DEMO other.
Bilateral contractual alliances involve cooperation and coordination as both parties work
together to achieve the alliance outcomes. Examples include joint research and development,DEMO
joint marketing, joint product development, and some forms of supplier partnerships and
outsourcing arrangements. The activities of partners are sometimes integrated and linked DEMO
Contracts may be open-ended and incomplete. Although not always acknowledged in the
5 Other typologies include the degree of vertical integration, from free market transactions to hierarchical (Lorange
and Roos, 1992); ad-hoc pool, consortium, project-based joint venture and full-blow joint venture  (Lorange and
Roos, DEMO); recurrent contracting and relational contracting (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992); unstructured co-
production projects, semi-structured projects, business-based joint ventures (Dussauge and Garrette, 1995).

literature, these alliances may contain some of the mechanisms found in equity alliances, such as
a dedicated managerial hierarchy, joint work teams and DEMO mutual exchange of hostages (Oxley,
1997). However, in the literature there is also an assumption that these control advantages are
more DEMO available and work more effectively in equity alliances.
The choice of alliance form
Alliance structure is important as it provides a mode of control DEMO is established through some
form of ownership or formal contract (Bierly DEMO Coombs, 2004). Note that alliance structure is
seen as a DEMO choice and is not predetermined by the purpose of the alliance. Thus,
various alliance forms can be used to achieve the same strategic DEMO (Das and Teng,
2001b).TCE has been used to explain DEMO equity—non-equity choice.
Under TCE, it is argued that managers will favour DEMO equity arrangement over a non-
equity alliance where there are frequent transactions, uncertainty is high, and there is high asset
specificity. In these DEMO the potential for opportunism is high. Equity alliances suit
alliances where there are many partners, and where there is broad product, technological or
DEMO scope (Colombo, 2003). These aspects contribute to increasing uncertainty and the
frequency of transactions. Equity arrangements are said to lead to lower DEMO costs than
found in non-equity alliances. The shared ownership is assumed to create incentive alignment
and an autonomous hierarchical structure provides superior monitoring and DEMO mechanisms.
Thus, equity alliances allow firms to deal effectively with contractual DEMO appropriability hazards
that are inherent in many alliances, particular where there DEMO the development, transfer or
exploitation of technological knowledge (Oxley, 1997; Gulati and Singh, 1998). Under equity
arrangements, goal alignment between DEMO partners minimises opportunism, and there is a mutual
hostage situation as DEMO partners have made substantial investments and are dependent on each
other’s performance. However, equity arrangements are limited in their flexibility, as they are
DEMO and costly to terminate. They can also result in unintended knowledge transfer (leakage)
among employees of partners who are working closely together, DEMO conflicting organizational
cultures and different control system perspectives can create conflict (DEMO and Coombs, 2004).
Under TCE, non-equity alliances are assumed to have weaker and fewer control
mechanisms than equity alliances (Poppo and Zenger, 2002; Reuer and Arino, 2002; Lui and
Ngo, 2004). Thus, contracts are used to limit opportunism in two ways. First, DEMO can increase
8
the cost of self-interest activities by including penalties for the violation of DEMO Second,
contracts can reduce monitoring costs by explicitly outlining the nature of the relationships
between partners and the activities that will be undertaken DEMO each partner (Parkhe, 1993; Lui
and Ngo, 2004). However, in non-equity alliances contracts cannot be written to cover every
situation and contingency, so other mechanisms must be relied on to effect control, DEMO
when the probability of opportunism is expected to be high.
The delineation between equity and non-equity locates where the decision rights in an
alliance DEMO, and hence, dictates where and how control is exercised. There is an assumption
that in non-equity alliances major decisions are exercised by the DEMO, whereas in equity
alliances control resides within the alliance itself. Thus, under TCE, where there are frequent
transactions, high uncertainty and high DEMO specificity, firms will choose to form equity, rather
than non-equity alliances. Where there are less frequency transactions, lower uncertainty and
lower asset specificity firms will form non-equity alliances. However, it has been argued that
minimising transaction costs is just one component of the structural decision, and managers’
perceptions of risk will also drive the choice of alliance structure (Das and Teng, 1996).
Risk and alliance structure
All strategic alliances entail risk, and alliance structures provide a source of control as different
forms can mitigate or add to the total risk of the alliance. Thus, managers’ perceptions of the risk
inherent in a prospective alliance can drive DEMO choice of alliance.
Relational risk is said to be unique to collaborative ventures, and is the probability and
consequences of not having satisfactory cooperation with alliance partners (Das and Teng, 1996).
Opportunistic behaviour by DEMO partner is a source of relational risk. Another source of relational
risk can arise from expected inequities in payoffs to partners in alliances. Equity DEMO often
interpreted as the proportionate payoff, given ones input. Some researchers DEMO that a high
level of perceived inequities may even discourage firms from entering into alliances. Nooteboom
(2004) outlines four types of relational risk: loss of resources, hold-up risk, spill-over risk and
psychological/social risk.
DEMO risk is more externally-focused and is the risk of not achieving the alliance
objectives, even when the partners do cooperate fully (Das and DEMO, 2001a). Unlike relational
risk, this form of risk is present in all types of business operations, and can relate to financial risk
9
and technological risk. Performance risk can arise from adverse government regulations,
DEMO of the market and a lack of competence within the partners. These two forms of risk are
independent of each other, but together make up the total risk of the alliance.
Das and Teng (1996, DEMO) claim that firms will choose certain structural arrangements
depending on which DEMO is perceived to be the greater threat. Equity alliances are said to be
better at mitigating relational risk and so will be chosen when DEMO risk of the prospective
alliance is perceived to be high. The control opportunities, alignment of interests and reduced
performance ambiguities that accompany equity structures will allow a firm to reduce the level
of relational risk. Relational DEMO may be high when firms have committed property resources to
the alliance (high asset specificity) that need protection, and where there is high uncertainty and
frequent interactions. In these cases, the potential for opportunistic behaviour is high and equity,
contractual and managerial control mechanisms may all DEMO used to reduce relational risk and
provide control. Bierly and Coombs (DEMO) and McCutcheon et al. (2004), like many other
researchers, DEMO on equity arrangements as a means of reducing risk, achieving control DEMO
ensuring success. Non-equity alliances tend to escalate the level of relational risk, so if managers
perceive relational risk in a prospective alliance is high, then choosing a non-equity alliance will
make this an even greater problem.
Where performance risk is the major exposure, whether due to lack of partner
competence, regulation change or other external shocks, flexibility may need DEMO be high to allow
for adaptation and change in the alliance arrangements. Non-equity alliances are more flexible,
and the level of commitment needed DEMO the partners is less than for an equity alliance. Short term
contracts associated with non-equity alliances allow the firm to change the partner, change the
contract or even terminate the alliance (Anderson and Sedatole, 2003)DEMO Equity alliances tend to
escalate performance risk due to the high asset specificity and high costs of governance and high
costs of failure, and so would not be chosen if initial perceptions of performance risk in DEMO
prospective alliance were high. While task uncertainty and asset specificity may influence the
level of perceived relational risk, they do not impact on perceived performance risk.
In summary, managers will choose to form an equity alliance if they assess relationship
risk to be is more dominant than performance DEMO, and will choose to form a non-equity alliance
if performance risk DEMO considered more dominant than relationship risk.
10
Trust and risk
Trust is said to be an important determinant of DEMO alliance governance structure and the
subsequent design of control systems. Several researchers have focused on the role of trust in
interfirm relationships and control (see, for example, Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1995; Chiles and
McMackin, 1996; Gietzmann, 1996; Nooteboom et al., 1997; Seal and Vincent-Jones, 1997;
Dekker, 2004; Chenhall and Langfield-Smith, 2003; Langfield-Smith and Smith, 2003).
However, it can be argued that trust influences DEMO choice of alliance structure through managers’
perceptions of risk.
Trust may develop over time through processes of learning and adaptation, which are
essential to the strengthening of the relationship between partners, making the relationship more
durable in the face of conflict and encouraging interactions between partners involving
knowledge DEMO and promotion of each other’s interests (Johanson and Mattsson, 1987).
Close relationships with alliance partners may involve the sharing of information, joint product
and process development and joint cost improvement activities, and trust allows such alliances to
flourish. It has been argued that certain minimum levels DEMO trust are essential in all inter-firm
relationships, as trust reduces the DEMO of opportunistic behaviour (Axelrod, 1984; Bradach
and Eccles, 1989; DEMO, 1998). In addition, trust may increase the predictability of mutual
behaviour through each party honouring commitments and allowing partners to deal with
DEMO contingencies in mutually acceptable ways (Sako, 1992, p. 37)
DEMO is a difficult concept to study as it has been defined and classified in many ways.
Most definitions of trust focus on exposing oneself DEMO vulnerability. A simple definition is that
trust is having confidence that one’s expectations will be realised (Luhmann, 1979). Other
definitions suggest that DEMO entails positive expectations regarding the other in a risky situation
(Gambetta, 1988), and includes adopting a belief, without having full information to confirm that
belief (Tomkins, 2001). It has been argued that DEMO is particularly relevant to alliances, as trust
is only important in DEMO where there is risk (Luhmann, 1988; Coleman, 1990; Sako, 1992),
and risk management is a critical aspect of alliances (DEMO and Van de Ven, 1992; Das and Teng,
2001b).
While many definitions of trust exist, two definitions of trust have emerged as
particularly relevant to the formation and management of strategic alliances. These DEMO
11
competence trust and goodwill trust (Sako, 1992).6 Competence trust focuses DEMO perceptions of
ability and expertise, and is the “expectation of technically DEMO role performance” (Barber,
1983, p.14). In an alliance, DEMO trust relates to a partner’s ability to perform according to
the specified agreement or contract (Nooteboom, 1996). In contrast, goodwill trust can be
defined as perceptions of a partner’s intention to perform in accordance DEMO those agreements
(Ring and van de Ven, 1992; Nooteboom, 1996). Goodwill trust is associated with integrity,
responsibility and dependability (Das and Teng, 2001a). While these forms of trust will be
present to some extent in the early stages of an alliance, they can also develop over time through
repeated interactions and experiences.
Das and Teng (2001b) argued that certain forms of trust are important in reducing risk.
Specifically, managers’ initial assessment of goodwill trust in partners is important in reducing
perceived relational risk, and initial assessments of competence trust can help reduce perceptions
of performance risk. Goodwill trust is likely to develop over DEMO, but this may be more
important to the success of equity DEMO, compared to non-equity alliances, due to non-equity
alliances greater reliance on contractual control (Das and Teng, 2001b). Equity alliances are said
DEMO entail greater interdependencies and interactions, so goodwill trust can become more DEMO
to ensuring success. When competence trust is perceived to be high, DEMO may reduce
performance risk, which is important in both equity and DEMO alliance.
Thus, high levels of goodwill trust will reduce perceived relational DEMO and high levels of
competence trust will reduce perceived performance risk.
Alliance structure and control systems
The prior sections have proposed that managers’ perceptions DEMO trust and risk at the start of an
alliance relationship may influence the choice of alliance structure. As different alliance
structures encompass certain control DEMO, the control system design may differ for each
type of alliance. DEMO and Teng (2001a) provide an analysis of the dimensions of trust, risk and
control that suit different alliance types. They suggest that high relational risk associated with an
equity alliance can be reduced through the DEMO of goodwill trust, behaviour controls and
6 A third form of DEMO that has been referred to in strategic alliance research is contractual trust, which is based on
the moral standard of honesty, and rests DEMO an assumption that the other party will honour the agreement, whether
DEMO agreement is in writing or not (Sako, 1992; van der DEMO and Vosselman, 2000). The higher the level
of contractual trust DEMO a firm has in a partner, the less need there is DEMO gather information to prevent or reduce
opportunistic behaviour. Contractual trust is not included here as it may not be distinct from goodwill trust.
12
social controls. Also, perceived performance risk, often associated with a non-equity DEMO can
be reduced through the development of competence trust, output control DEMO social control.
Summary
In this section the relations between the relation characteristics, trust, risk, choice of alliance
structure and design of MCS have been proposed. These relations are summarised in Figure 1.
The focus of DEMO analysis is on managers’ perceptions of trust and risk in the pre-alliance stage.
It is generally assumed that optimum choices are made prior to DEMO the alliance, and the
choice of design of management control systems DEMO made by taking into account that structural
choice. However, trust will DEMO to develop over time as the alliance proceeds, to further
reduce DEMO perceived and actual relational risk and performance risk, and this will DEMO on the
effectiveness of the management control package. Control in an alliance is achieved through a
combination of the control aspects inherent in the DEMO structure, specifically designed control
mechanisms and the operation of trust.

3. Case Study: WaterCom Wastewater Alliance
The focus of DEMO case study is on the events leading up to the alliance, DEMO processes that took
place during the interim alliance and the early days of the formal alliance.7 These events are
summarised in Table 1.
Insert DEMO 1 here
Background
In 2002, managers at WaterCom considered the various DEMO and contractual
arrangements that could be used to undertake the upgrade of three waste water plants. WaterCom
is a public sector entity and so DEMO with accountabilities to several stakeholders: the
WaterCom Board, the local government authority (AB Council) that owns it, and the community.
It has a strong engineering focus and a history of large scale asset construction DEMO management.
7 This case is based on interviews with managers who were involved in the formation of the alliance and were part
of the DEMO management team, that were conducted in April and May 2004. These DEMO were employed by
WaterCom and one of the partners. The researchers were also able to view the workshop orientation material, the
workings of the total cost estimate, and on-line material that related to the alliance. Several details of the alliance
have been changed to protect confidentiality.
13
WaterCom is responsible for delivering the capital programme and maintenance program for
DEMO supply and sewerage for the AB Council, which covers one of DEMO largest local government
areas in Australia.
Historically, WaterCom delivered all construction DEMO in-house. In the 1980s, they
had a large design capacity and DEMO labour construction force. However, over time it became
difficult to compete DEMO with the large privately-owned construction companies, and
WaterCom started to enter DEMO design and development contracts. In these collaborations
WaterCom completed the process design, and the design and construction of the plants were
contracted out, DEMO a fixed cost contract. The contractors were responsible for delivering plants
that met specifications, and WaterCom was responsible for making sure that the plant operated
as required for AB Council. Some of these contracts were successful DEMO others resulted in cost
overruns and contractual issues, as well as DEMO disputes. The next stage was to use
formal partnering. This involved working with facilitators to develop communication strategies
and ways of operating as a DEMO with the construction companies. The major problem with
this approach was that when there were problems and disputes, all parties reverted to the contract
for resolution and the atmosphere tended to be antagonistic.
Thus, WaterCom had a long history of completing construction contracts using partnering
arrangements, and sometimes joint ventures for non-construction projects. These collaborations
had only achieved varying levels DEMO success, and there was some debate within WaterCom about
the deficiencies DEMO the past contracting arrangements. However, some managers in WaterCom
and the DEMO body were aware that an alliance model had been used successful in some very
high profile major construction projects, involving public and private companies. One of these
projects was an inner-city bypass, completed by another arm of AB Council, so there was
considerable support by some Council managers for using an alliance model for the proposed
wastewater processing plants. However, the move was viewed by some WaterCom managers
with scepticism, as it entailed a very different mode of thinking and managing.
Phase 1: The pre-alliance and partner selection
A consultant who specialised in alliance structuring was DEMO, and he helped managers at
WaterCom and AB Council review the DEMO of possible arrangements that could be used to
manage the construction of the wastewater plants—from in-house construction through to an
14
alliance. This involved a series of workshops, and there was some agreement that a “pure
alliance” was the way to proceed. Three new plants DEMO needed and for efficiency reasons a
decision was made to form a single alliance to cover all three projects.
AB Council gave WaterCom permission DEMO proceed with the alliance, and a commitment
was made by managers DEMO AB Council and WaterCom to participate in the selection process and
to allow alliance principles to govern the selection process and operations of the DEMO These
principles encompassed some of the following: a focus on business DEMO where all partners
collectively either win or lose, collective responsibility of DEMO partners, clear accountabilities
within a no-blame culture, open-book principles, and DEMO and honest communications (Ross,
2003). Key managers in WaterCom DEMO training to introduce them to alliance principles
and to educate them as to what it would mean for WaterCom.
Key stakeholders, such as WaterCom Board members, senior AB Council managers and
councillors assisted in the partner selection, which did not follow the usual tendering process.
WaterCom worked within a range of legislative restrictions that limited its flexibility, and
consultation and due process were important. A formal public tendering process was required for
DEMO contracts in excess of $100,000. However, for this project permission DEMO sought to follow a
different process. A formal Request for Proposal was issued to attract consortiums of companies
to apply for the work. As DEMO WaterCom manager explained, only limited details of the proposed
project were DEMO:
The scope of work was quite broad.  It said we'DEMO got 3 plants, we want to upgrade their
capacity from X DEMO Y, we want to get nitrogen of 5 milligrams per litre DEMO want to finish
by October 2005.  That was pretty well the DEMO of the work.  No money. No details. And
by the way DEMO haven't got final development approvals, license standards, and things like
that.  It also had the selection procedures and criteria—5 major areas and sub-areas, but
it didn’t have weightings.
A public briefing was held for potential consortiums, who were asked to put in a proposal
of 35 pages, which is considered very brief in the construction industry. WaterCom announced
which of their own staff would be working within the alliance—they had DEMO in the design
of waste water treatment plants and project management—and as the industry consisted of a
limited number of major companies, many of whom had worked with WaterCom in the past,
most consortium members DEMO familiar with these WaterCom staff. Thus, consortiums could
15
assess the complimentary skills that they needed to contribute, and also whether or not they
wished to work with those particular people in the DEMO Seven consortia submitted proposals.
Consortiums consisted of process engineering consultants, design DEMO, construction
companies and specialised engineering design companies.
Some of the companies DEMO formed consortiums had undertaken work for WaterCom in
the past, and DEMO of them were interested in the new project that was being proposed. A
manager in one of the construction companies explained how a consortium DEMO brought together,
which indicates the level of familiarity within the industry:
When the document came out the project was much larger than DEMO expected and we had
developed a small team that included ourselves, DEMO and KQ, who is a designer...we re-
looked at our group DEMO we said “no, we're don't have the resources to DEMO it”, so we
looked for another design group .. NX had DEMO in design, but also they're
multinational and they've done DEMO before so we saw a big strength in what they
could bring to the team.  So we introduced them into the alliance.
We'd worked with BN on a sewerage treatment plant; they worked with us as a
subcontractor. And with KQ we worked together previously…so we knew DEMO other's
strengths and weaknesses to a degree, but not entirely. DEMO also had a previous alliance
with UG, which is another construction DEMO, so we brought them in…That was
beneficial as well because we DEMO now able to draw on resources from quite a number
of organizations instead of just one or three.
The selection panel held half-day interviews DEMO the four best proposals, to allow the
consortiums to sell their DEMO and abilities. A key focus was to outline the principles of the
alliance model, assess the consortiums’ understanding and suitability for working within this
model, and their potential to commit to the alliance. This was followed by separate two-day
workshops for the two final short-listed consortiums. One of DEMO successful consortium members
explained the approach taken in the application process and the workshop:
In 35 pages we had to sell our track DEMO, our people and sell our ability to rise to the
occasion DEMO it was about changing your mindset about how you deliver these things.
Our history was working as a contractor to our client WaterCom, and now we were
going to work as partners.  So they knew what our capabilities were in terms of contract
work but they were not DEMO in the day to day activities so they didn't really
16
understand our true capabilities and our weaknesses as well. There were a DEMO of
questions that for us were difficult to answer, especially as DEMO had never worked in an
alliance before.  If we had answered DEMO questions now they'd be easy…  We just
couldn't get DEMO heads around what this really meant, and what we needed to DEMO as
an alliance team and how we could engage WaterCom and their expertise.  Anyway we
succeeded in getting to stage one which was a 4 hour interview …
We had a two day workshop at which DEMO had to do presentations explain to our
potential client what our views were and how we would deliver a complex project which
we knew DEMO of! It [the workshop] was structured and we talked about expectations.
We didn't focus on the technical detail. We focused on the warm DEMO fuzzys, how we
would work together as a team, how we would benchmark ourselves, and how we would
deliver outstanding outcomes, and DEMO we could we do as a team achieve that.  If you
DEMO't worked in an alliance before it is very difficult to answer those questions but we
got through and I think it was due DEMO the honesty of our team and the passion of our team.
The purpose of the workshops was for the members of each consortium team DEMO
WaterCom’s alliance members to effectively start working together as the alliance. It was
important for all of the potential alliance members to experience what DEMO would be like to work
closely together, and for WaterCom to DEMO the potential of each consortium to deliver on the
outcomes. This process was viewed as “a test of relationships”. Thus, it was made very clear to
the two consortiums that they could only send their intended DEMO team to the workshop–“the
A-team not the B team”. After each workshop, the four members of the selection panel
individually scored each consortium, DEMO after considerable debate among the panel members,
the final consortium was chosen.
After the selection of the wining consortium there were two weeks DEMO commercial
negotiations between the consortium partners and WaterCom. Up to this stage, commercial
arrangements for the alliance had not been discussed. This was to make sure that the selection
process could focus on selecting partners in DEMO with the criteria and conducting
activities that would give WaterCom assurance that the chosen consortium would be able to hold
to the principles of DEMO alliance.
The successful consortium consisted of five partners, including WaterCom. The
DEMO negotiations included assessing the “normal” profit margins for each partner, which
DEMO
were used to determine part of the reimbursement schedule. These discussions were DEMO
on an open-book basis and WaterCom was also able to send in probity auditors to each partner to
examine their books. Interestingly, the partners were very willing to share information about
costs, overheads and profit margins. The final reimbursement schedule was discussed, and the
risk and reward aspects and governance arrangements were determined. The outcome of this
discussion was an DEMO project alliance agreement (IPAA) of only 10 pages. An important
aspect of this agreement was that the five partners agreed to work together DEMO the alliance
over the next nine months to develop a target cost estimate for the project.
Phase 2: The interim alliance and development of the TC
In December 2002, immediately after the IPAA was signed, DEMO began on the target cost
estimate (TC). There were 30 DEMO 40 staff in the interim alliance and they worked on the TC over
the next nine months. The alliance was governed by a project DEMO board (PAB), and day-to-
day management was under the direction DEMO an alliance management team (AMT) located within
the alliance. (Governance DEMO are explained in a later section.) The alliance was totally
self-managing DEMO alliance management had free rein to use any techniques or processes that
they saw fit to develop the TC and then later to manage DEMO alliance and the construction project.
Creating an alliance perspective
Not surprisingly it was initially very difficult for the alliance members who had come from DEMO
of the partners to work together as an alliance, and to DEMO how to do this. The alliance
manager explained.
That was a real challenge for us. What do we do? How do we get to the next level? How
do we become an outstanding team? These DEMO all issues that we had to deal with and we
looked at other alliances but there were no clear directions for us that we DEMO see. So
we ended up doing a lot of it ourselves.
One initial problem was that work on the TC commenced before the alliance DEMO had
completed current projects in their home organization and before formal training and alliance
orientation had taken place. Alliance roles had also not been DEMO There were some conflicts
and issues to be worked through, and DEMO facilitators were brought in to assist.
18
During the TC estimation process the different perspectives held by designers versus
DEMO people needed to be managed and directed. Within the construction industry these
different orientations are not unusual. However, in this alliance the design of the plants were
developed at the same time as the construction and DEMO processes, to achieve the overall
lowest cost over the life of DEMO project. In many cases designers tend to focus on delivering a
design, without full consideration of the cost associated with building or operating that design.
However, for this project the focus was on delivering a design that had the lowest total capital
cost and operating cost. This outcome DEMO achieved by sharing a single office and through
continual interactions between all groups from the start of the interim project period.
Another important issue DEMO the setting up of a separate office...which is absolutely
essential.  You DEMO work out of the offices at one of the companies. We had the
designers and estimators and constructors, all together while we were developing the
target cost estimate, and we had the constructors in here all the time with their input. And
that's the big difference between DEMO hard money contract and an alliance…normally you
go through your design bit and then the constructors come along. In our case we were
looking DEMO constructability issues at the same time as we were looking at design issues.
A related issue was the difficulty getting all groups in the DEMO to accept the notion of
stretch targets. Target setting was not unusual in the construction industry, but was not the norm
for designers—and stretch targets were even more unusual. This was handled by formulating
milestones, celebrating success and then setting the next (stretch) milestone. There was a DEMO
among alliance management that to develop the TC at the level of detail required, to withstand
the scrutiny of all partners, a professional, consistent and carefully managed team approach was
needed.
Estimating the total cost
DEMO estimation of the TC involved estimating and negotiating the risks and opportunities of the
project. This was a very detailed and sophisticated process. For DEMO cost component an
estimated cost was developed, a minimum and maximum DEMO, the likelihood of each risk was
assessed, and the overall net risk (risk less opportunity) was simulated using Monte Carlo
analysis. The DEMO consisted of a list of all of the things that could go wrong in the operation,
19
such as bad weather, foreign exchange movements in costs, the impact DEMO new engineering
methodologies, or breakthroughs in design. Initially, a total of 180 different risks were identified,
costing $35 million, on a total project cost of $122 million. However, opportunities of $5 million
were also identified. There were many rounds of reviews by the PAB and by DEMO partners, and
eventually net risks were brought down to $9 million.
DEMO were several techniques that the alliance members used to encourage the
identification of the risks. During the TC estimation period, the alliance team met every morning
at 7.30am for about 20 minutes to discuss the project DEMO to manage the project against the
agreed TC.
We talked about the project. Where we were at, what we needed from each other. And we
had one person who was handling the risk and opportunities. His DEMO was to identify the
risks in the discussions...
Another method was to keep a book, where everybody wrote down anything they could think of.
We had this big document full of peoples’ handwriting and then we DEMO through each
individual item to make sure that it was either no longer a risk, it was in the TC, or we
don'DEMO have to worry about it.  So we kept a running tab DEMO I guess the outstanding part
of all of this is that we didn't put it [the book] aside.  We've used it extensively during the
project delivery process as well.  We actually revisit all the risks on a regular basis,
reassess them, eliminate them if they're no longer there and introduce new ones if there
are new DEMO
The development of innovative thinking and of innovative outputs was considered to be
an important part of the estimation process. Innovations were needed to DEMO risk, and hence
reduce the target cost, and these opportunities were far more difficult to identify than the risks. A
facilitator was engaged DEMO run a workshop to try to encourage innovation, which was needed DEMO
take the risk out of the project. An important innovation that resulted was the development of a
new filter eliminated a $1.5 million potential DEMO from the project. Another innovation was a
change in design at one of the sites, which involved building one long plant, rather than DEMO
two plants side by side. In the development of the TC, DEMO series of innovations were considered
and then probabilities were assigned to each, which sometimes was based on whether or not it
was likely that the innovation could be evaluated and acted upon, perhaps because of time
constraints.
20
During the development of the TC, an independent expert continually completed reviews
of all the proposed costs. The alliance manager explained:
We had DEMO internal reviews.  More than we would normally do to make sure DEMO
the costs were right and that people couldn't throw stones at the way we had approached
it and the philosophies and principles that DEMO used.  And at the end of all of this we
then DEMO a corporate review, we invited all the partners to come in DEMO say “OK, this is
our target cost, now guys, this DEMO yours.  This is what we're going to build”.  [we told the
partners] “You've all got to commit to it, so you need to review it and make sure that
you're happy that DEMO've done everything right”.
Agreeing on the final TC
The TC took nine months to develop and negotiate with all parties. The TC went DEMO three
stages, each stage was communicated to all partners, including WaterCom, and then reworked.
On October 2003, the TC was signed by DEMO parties. This signing indicated acceptance of the total
cost estimate as well as all other targets for non-financial indicators. These included safety,
employee DEMO, environmental outcomes, construction time, and quality of the water
outputs. DEMO, this was not a smooth process.
For WaterCom the adoption of DEMO alliance model was very different from the sometimes
confrontational hard contracting approach of the past, and there were tensions within WaterCom
as to whether a competitive alliance, rather than a collaborative alliance should have been
chosen. When the total cost estimates were being prepared and needed to be DEMO by
WaterCom, and when cost reimbursement claims came to WaterCom for DEMO to the
partners, the old mode of thinking would have been DEMO Water Com managers to challenge each
one of the costs. However, DEMO was not the ethos or the approach agreed to under the alliance
model.
The use of an independent assessor to validate each of the DEMO design quantities and
costs was not sufficient to satisfy some of the WaterCom managers. They questioned whether the
WaterCom managers who were assigned the DEMO of assessing the components of the
TC and working with the alliance partners, had been sufficiently challenging and tough in
scrutinizing those costs. Under former construction contracts, there were expectations that every
cost would have been questioned: “Are we sure that this is the best value.  Is DEMO price sharp?
21
Let's look at the person that should be doing the work.” DEMO managers thought that the TC had
to be inflated, and this DEMO some tensions between WaterCom and the PAB.
However, the process of DEMO and eventual accepting the TC was stressful for all
parties. A WaterCom manager explained:
There was probably a pretty clear expectation by all DEMO that the non acceptance
of the total cost estimate would signal a failure for all parties.  We would have had to
turn around and say that the alliance methodology had failed, and then revert to another
model to get better value for the organization.  So that would have had to have been
pretty damning indicating (a) that we didn'DEMO manage the relationship or (b) that we didn't
think this through initially.
Stage 3: Commencement of the formal alliance
Once the interim alliance was complete the design phase of the project began. During this DEMO
there was comprehensive monthly reporting to the PAB, which tracked costs DEMO non-financial
KPIs (key performance indicators) against estimated risks and opportunities and milestones.
Details of the progress of the design and eventually the early DEMO phase were also
reported. This report was also received by senior managers at WaterCom. A significant part of
the partners’ remuneration was tied to DEMO of non-financial and financial KPI targets,
which were audited at various intervals. However, there were also financial penalties for not
achieving KPI targets. Not all of the KPIs flowed through to the financial outcomes of DEMO
project. For example, some KPIs addressed community and environmental impacts, which were
part of the charter of WaterCom and AB Council.
While KPI DEMO were initially developed by the PAB, the detailed working of the DEMO
(key performance areas) was undertaken by the AMT.
We've set ourselves some pretty tough challenges.  [For example] In terms of safety we
looked at other alliances and what they were doing.  We benchmarked ourselves against
the D alliance, which is a $1.4 billion project.  We DEMO up there to see how they operate
and what they did and then we took some of those learnings. We've set ourselves a DEMO
difficult audit program which focuses primarily on management involvement and
demonstration by management that safety is important. And we are actually going to
score DEMO how well we do, how often we attend safety committee meetings, how
22
often we go out on site and do safety walks… so it'DEMO really a top down approach in terms
of demonstration out commitment to these targets.
The KRAs that were developed by the AMT were very DEMO and they were
designed to influence behaviour and to feed through to the KPIs. KRAs were assigned to
individuals in the alliance, depending on what they could influence or control. In aggregating
KRAs, greater weightings were given to proactive and training activities, as opposed to reactive
activities.
Retaining an alliance perspective
Managers and other key staff were seconded full-time to DEMO alliance. A key principle of the
alliance was that partners would select staff for the alliance in line with what was best for the
DEMO While staff worked in the alliance it was intended that they should be loyal to that
alliance, not the partner. The alliance manager explained:
I made a conscious decision when I joined this alliance that DEMO am the alliance manager.
It's my virtual organization.  So I DEMO it as such and I try to have no bias whatsoever
with any of the parties and I've tried to deliver the outcomes DEMO the goals that we've set
ourselves.
Joining the alliance also required a new perspective and rethinking about the previous client-
relationship with WaterCom:DEMO
[The deputy alliance manager seconded from WaterCom] is considered to be an alliance
team member; he's not considered a client anymore.  Our DEMO in reality for us now is
really the production group—the people who are going to take over the plant at the end,
so DEMO see them more as the client now.
However, retaining commitment to DEMO alliance and the alliance principles was a
continual challenge. As the project progressed, designers were looking ahead to the end of their
time in the alliance and thinking and planning for the next job. From time DEMO time partner
organizations tried to entice their employees to return to their home organization to participate in
formulating and winning the next alliance bid, and then to work on those other projects. The
partners, through the PAB had agreed to supply the best people for each job in DEMO alliance.
However, this promise was often difficult to deliver, with partner firms being involved in many
23
other competing projects. The members of the PAB often had difficulties in DEMO their
commitment to the alliance, while at the same time being DEMO of the partner
organizations—sometimes these two interests conflicted.
At the completion of the design stage phase many of the designers returned to their home
DEMO and new staff who would manage the construction stage joined the alliance. The
AMT remained, but the staff changeover brought new challenges for the AMT in managing the
alliance team and establishing the alliance perspective.
Governance DEMO organizational arrangements
During the workshop and commercial negotiations many aspects of governance and management
of the alliance were decided. The alliance was not incorporated DEMO a separate entity, but was
managed by a Project Alliance Board (PAB). The PAB consisted of representatives from each of
the five DEMO, as well as the AB Council. The role of the PAB DEMO to deliver resources, set
policies and make decisions that might be DEMO for the alliance management to make. For
example, such decisions may DEMO to a particular alliance partner. Sometimes PAB members
needed to make decisions that were not in the best interests, or which were contrary to their
particular partner’s interests. During the interim alliance and the development of DEMO total cost
estimate, the PAB met every two weeks. Once the DEMO had been formed it met monthly.
The alliance was located at separate offices in a location away from the partners and
while staff from DEMO five partners was seconded full-time to work in the alliance, their DEMO
continued to be paid by the partner organization. An alliance management team (AMT) was
formed to manage the day-to-day operations, headed by an alliance manager (from one of the
partners) and a deputy alliance DEMO (from WaterCom). There were two distinct, but
overlapping stages for the project: design and construction. The design team operated for about
the first two years, and then most returned staff to their home organization. The majority of the
construction team operated for the following two years. DEMO, some staff were there for the
duration of the project.
Major DEMO concerning the alliance were made by the PAB, not the partners, almost
without exception. However, any variations in the total cost estimate would have been
WaterCom’s sole decision, and would have needed approval by the AB Council. However, new
24
design proposals or other changes and issues were handled by the PAB. DEMO PAB was given the
task of managing the alliance risk, through DEMO AMT. 8
As the alliance was not a separate entity, partners’ DEMO payments were submitted to
the alliance management team for approval and reimbursement by WaterCom. Thus, WaterCom
had a curious status within the alliance. It was effectively the client, but it was also a partner.
However, DEMO was not the dominant voice on the PAB, and WaterCom as DEMO client did not have
any veto or majority decision rights. Any decision made by the PAB had to be unanimously
supported by all members DEMO the PAB, and some of the members of the PAB were DEMO senior
managers in the partner organizations. A member of the alliance selection panel explained the
approach taken in selecting members of the PAB.
One DEMO the questions we asked at the half day interviews was “tell me why you have been
nominated as a board member” and a few DEMO them gave what we considered was the right
answer which was “because I can make decisions that commit my company”. And that's
why DEMO've got to have senior members on the board. The alliance board is a consensus
and unanimous.  There are no votes, there are DEMO split decisions.  You stay in that room
until you come up DEMO an answer.  It's a binding decision for the board, and if you
haven't got people in there who can make decisions DEMO it can't work, because they
would have to go away DEMO get approvals and get things ratified [by the partner
organization] and then the other board members would have to get things ratified as
well…but DEMO important that the board member can made binding decisions.
However, the DEMO was not the same as a typical corporate board of directors. The PAB
also had a leadership role in the alliance. Each PAB member DEMO given a specific role to
champion in the alliance, such as DEMO, environment, community, people and lifestyle. While all
PAB members would DEMO time on the construction site and the office reviewing these aspects,
each member would give particular attention to that aspect that they were DEMO For
example, the PAB member who focused on safety, attended safety meetings, conducted safety
walks on the construction site, and was particularly DEMO in participating in the management of
safety.
8 This referred to performance risk.
25
Shared responsibility and risk
Under traditional construction contracts, responsibilities and risk are allocated to each party and
there are legal consequences for those parties DEMO do not manage those risks or who fail to
deliver on their contractual obligations. However, under the type of alliance adopted by
WaterCom, DEMO was a difference in that the partners agreed to:
1. Assume collective responsibility for delivering the project;
2. Take collective ownership of DEMO risks and opportunities that are associated with the
delivery of the project; and
3. Share the ‘pain or gain’ that results from the comparison of the project outcomes with the
agreed targets that they jointly committed DEMO achieve. (Ross, 2003)
Thus, WaterCom chose to set up DEMO alliance where specific aspects of risk were not transferred to
individual partners—it was shared jointly by the alliance members. There was one exception to
DEMO which related to the risk of gaining of EPA approval for the project, which WaterCom
agreed to separate from the alliance and assume total responsibility. The risk of getting EPA
approval to commence the project and DEMO project upgrades was considered major, and could
result in costly delays DEMO the project start and commissioning. This separation of the risk was
negotiated between the PAB and WaterCom during the TC phase. It arose from DEMO concern that
the quality of the wastewater input to the plants, DEMO affected the quality of the plant outputs
could not be controlled by the alliance.
Also, each party choose to waive their common law rights to sue each other partner. This
was initially difficult to accept, particularly at WaterCom, but it was an important principle in the
alliance model. Any disagreements were to be resolved within the alliance itself.
A large DEMO innovative construction project often gives rise to new processes and
techniques—new intellectual property. In the interim project agreement and alliance agreement it
was expected DEMO the alliance would develop IP output, but no firm decision was DEMO in
relation to the ownership of IP.
Remuneration: risk and reward
DEMO partners were reimbursed under a ‘three limb structure’, and the details DEMO this structure
were agreed to and included as part of the interim project alliance agreement.
26
•
•
•
Limb one consisted of payments to partners for all DEMO costs associated with the
alliance, and these were reimbursed to each DEMO as the costs were expended. These costs
were those estimated in the total cost estimate.
Limb two was reimbursement to cover corporate overhead costs DEMO with the direct
costs, including an allowance for “normal” profit.
Limb DEMO was a series of payments which related to each partners’ agreed share of “pain or
gain” associated with the project. This consisted of the DEMO against the project’s
financial and non-financial KPI targets, which all partners DEMO made a joint commitment to
achieve. Non-achievement of targets led to financial penalties for all alliance partners, and
any superior performance led to a sharing of the rewards by all partners.
4. Case Analysis
As argued DEMO an earlier section of this paper, managers will choose to enter DEMO an equity alliance
when there is high uncertainty, high asset specificity, and high frequency of interactions
(transactions). Equity alliances may also be appropriate when there is a technological
component, many partners and a broad span of activities. These features suggest that there is a
high probability DEMO opportunistic behaviour by partners and, hence, a high level of relational risk.
Equity arrangements provide superior monitoring and control mechanisms, and shared
ownership creates incentive alignment, so can deal more effectively with contractual and
appropriability hazards, compared to a non-equity alliance. However, if perceived performance
risk DEMO more dominant than relational risk, then a non-equity alliance may be DEMO Goodwill
trust and competence trust in the partners may also influence the choice of alliance structure and
control system, through managers’ perceptions of relational risk and performance risk.
This section contains a discussion of the factors DEMO processes that influenced perceived
risk, governance structure and control in the DEMO study. First, factors that influenced perceptions
of risk will be explained, by focusing on the following questions. How did the characteristics of
the DEMO influence risk? How was trust assessed and developed in the early DEMO of the
alliance? How critical was perceived risk and what were DEMO activities that increased or decreased
perceptions of risk? Next, the issues that influenced the choice of governance structure will be
considered. Finally, the features of the control package used in the alliance will be outlined.
DEMO
Factors that influenced perceptions of risk
Characteristics of the transaction
Many of DEMO transactional features of the WaterCom alliance suggest that WaterCom might have
chosen to form an equity alliance, rather than a non-equity alliance. Asset specificity was high for
all parties, but particularly so for WaterCom. WaterCom had committed significant funds to the
alliance, as well as many dedicated staff (human asset specificity). It had full ownership of the
waste water plants that were being built, contributed the greatest share of the costs of
construction, and there was high brand specificity relating to the reputational aspects of the waste
water project. Uncertainty can be characterised by output DEMO and task
programmability, and in this alliance both can be regarded DEMO difficult and ambiguous. There
were many partners in the alliance, and DEMO was a technological component. Transactional
interactions between the partners were frequent and significant, extending over many years and
covering many different issues and activities.
Thus, according to TCE, these features suggest high levels of relational DEMO which can
best be controlled through an equity alliance. However, perceived DEMO in the partners can also
influence perceptions of risk, and hence DEMO choice of alliance structure.
Competence trust and goodwill trust
In an earlier section, it was suggested that in a prospective alliance high levels of goodwill trust
will reduce perceived relational risk and high levels of competence DEMO will reduce perceived
performance risk. In assessing the levels of trust in the wastewater alliance, it is relevant to
consider perceptions of trust not only in the pre-alliance stage, but during the interim alliance,
when there were opportunities to further develop trust prior to the signing of DEMO alliance
agreement.
Prior to the selection of the successful alliance consortium, DEMO of the selection
committee had certain perceptions of both goodwill trust and competence trust for each of the
potential partners. The industry was relatively DEMO, consisting of only a handful of major
participants, and many of those organisations had worked together on projects which created
high degree of DEMO with both the organisations, and also the key individuals in those
DEMO However, as stated in the case, working with the consortium members in a
contractual partnership did not always give WaterCom or the consortium DEMO insights into
28
what is would be like to work with the partners in an DEMO interviews and workshops
were designed to assess these issues. The underlying principles of the “pure” alliance form that
had been chosen by WaterCom were DEMO dependent on there being a reasonable level of
goodwill trust between partners. The extensive interview process and workshops were described
as providing an opportunity DEMO “test the relationships”, so WaterCom could assess if the short-
listed DEMO could potentially work within the alliance principles. This implies that the
successful consortium was chosen because the selection committee believed they had a certain
DEMO of goodwill trust that could be developed further.
During the interim alliance there were several opportunities to further develop goodwill
trust. So by the DEMO of the interim stage, the level of goodwill trust had increased, and
was sufficiently strong to allow the formal alliance to proceed. However, how was that trust
developed?
It has been suggested that goodwill DEMO can be established and strengthened through the
following mechanisms: developing mutual DEMO, building individual and team-level trust,
building institutional trust and joint DEMO resolution (Das and Teng, 2001a). Each of these will
be discussed. Developing mutual interests reduces the potential for conflict (Creed and Miles,
1996) and leads to partners caring about each others’ interests, DEMO greater reliability in
the other partner, and hence goodwill trust increases. DEMO trust depends on the level of trust
between individuals (Ring and DEMO de Ven, 1994), which can then develop into trust at DEMO team
or firm levels. Thus, developing individual-level trust can lead to DEMO between partners and is
vital to the promotion of goodwill trust. The more closely partners in a strategic alliance work
together, the greater is the scope for the development of interpersonal trust, such as goodwill
trust. Institutional trust provides another avenue for building goodwill trust, and may develop
through common membership of formal social structures, such as professional or trade
associations, as members will have better information about each other and be less likely to
undertake opportunistic behaviour as their reputation can be damaged DEMO easily (Zucker,
1986). WaterCom and the partners worked in DEMO same industry and had common industry
networks. Finally, joint dispute resolution DEMO provide partners with the opportunity to
understand each other better and to appreciate differences in perspectives, ideas and approaches,
leading to the development of goodwill trust (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994; Das and Teng,
2001a).
29
Das and Teng (2001a) argued that in non-equity alliances establishing mutual DEMO
and institutional trust are particularly important sources of goodwill trust, while DEMO other two
sources are less critical. However, they also argued that DEMO non-equity ventures, goodwill trust is
not as critical as competence trust.
DEMO trust may be determined more objectively than goodwill trust. Competence
trust can be assessed through the proactive collection of information about partners (Das and
Teng, 2001a), through direct and open communications with the partners, DEMO through
networking with other firms to gain inside information about a firm’s competence and
background (Creed and Miles, 1996). In the case DEMO, there is evidence of a high degree of
familiarity with participants DEMO the construction industry, partners were asked to relate their
experience and DEMO in the Request for Proposal, and WaterCom had worked with several DEMO the
consortium firms on prior projects. Thus, WaterCom was able to DEMO competence and worries
about competence of the selected consortium did not appear to be a major issue for managers at
WaterCom.
WaterCom managers had DEMO perceptions of trust during the selection process, the
interview and the DEMO During the interim alliance there were also many opportunities for
trust development, up to the time where the formal alliance was constituted.
Relationship risk and performance risk
It has been argued that an important driver of DEMO choice of equity structure is whether perceived
relational risk is more dominant than perceived performance risk. Was this the situation in the
WaterCom alliance?DEMO
In a prior section it was argued that in the wastewater alliance, the characteristics of the
relation would have contributed to increasing WaterCom’s perceptions of relational risk. The
complexity of the projects and the mix of DEMO from a variety of organizations, all with their
own cultures and DEMO, could also have increased perceptions of both relational risk and
performance DEMO However, there were several other aspects which would have acted to DEMO
relational risk.
The Australian construction industry consists of a limited number of large players, which
are all well known to each other and there was a history of past contracts and collaborations
between most of the DEMO and WaterCom. These past experiences may have favourably
30
disposed WaterCom to some of the partners. Alliance history is said to DEMO high levels of
goodwill trust, and hence lead to lower perceived DEMO risk (Gulati, 1995). Repeated
alliances between known partners is said to reduce the perceptions of opportunistic behaviour
(Das and Teng, 2001b)DEMO WaterCom had not always had successful relations with all of the
partners, and these experiences could have created unfavourable perceptions of the propensity
for opportunism and relational problems. However, in those projects they may also have
developed knowledge of where potential opportunistic exposures might occur, which could have
been accounted for in any new relationship. It has been argued that DEMO unfavourable histories
with former partners may not necessarily lead to a high probability of opportunism, or higher
relational risk, as shortcoming are known DEMO can be accounted for (Das and Teng, 2001b).
The difficulty in protecting propriety knowledge can increase relational risk (Das and
Teng, DEMO). This “dissemination risk” (Brouthers, Brouthers and Wilkinson, 1995) is the
unintended loss of control of technology or knowledge that can often DEMO through poorly
conceived contractual arrangements. In the case study, the partners DEMO not see this as a threat. In
fact, the creation of DEMO knowledge and processes was encouraged, and was shared by the
partners. DEMO PAB had decided to defer any decisions about the ownership of any new
proprietary processes to the end of the project. Another driver of DEMO risk is perceived
inequities in the future pay-offs from the alliance (DEMO and Teng, 1996). This may have been an
initial concern DEMO this case, as during the commercial negotiations meetings there was
considerable DEMO sharing and discussion to arrive at a firm agreement about
reimbursement and the share of profit and loss that would be allowed to each DEMO
WaterCom managers may have initially perceived performance risk to be high, DEMO
of the complexity of the project and the range of unidentified activities that would be undertaken
over the course of the project. The long DEMO detailed process of formulating the TC was to guard
against performance risk, while as the same time it assisted in the reducing relational risk. Many
of the activities that were undertaken in phase 1 of the DEMO implies that there was a
recognition that both forms of risk needed to be reduced before all partners entered into the
contractual agreement to DEMO the project. The interviews and workshops allowed
WaterCom to assess the ability of potential partners to work in harmony and to commit to the
DEMO of the alliance, and relational risk was assessed and minimised during DEMO interim alliance
phase.
31
Summary
In summary, the characteristics of the relation would have contributed to increase perceptions of
relational risk, while activities in the pre-alliance and interim alliance were undertaken to reduce
both relational and performance risk, so that effective control within the non-equity alliance was
achievable.
Issues that influenced the DEMO of governance structure
The prior literature and the model in Figure 1 suppose that managers make a rational choice of
alliance structure, based on information and perceptions about the risks and advantages of each
structural form DEMO trust in the prospective partners. However, other aspects may also drive DEMO
choice. The alliance model that was chosen had been used by other large construction ventures in
Australia. These successes were well known and had DEMO a high profile. The model assumes
that initial perceptions of trust and other characteristics of the relation will influence perceptions
of risk, and lead to a choice of equity or non-equity governance structure. However, WaterCom
and its parent AB Council made a firm commitment to adopt a non-equity DEMO before it
selected the partners.
This may not be totally inconsistent with the literature. The assessment of relational and
performance risk relates more to DEMO project, than to the specific partners, whereas perceptions of
goodwill trust and competence trust relates to the specific partners. While the choice of DEMO non-
equity alliance was described as a firm commitment for WaterCom and its parent AB Council,
there were several stages in the project DEMO there it was possible to change or even terminate
the venture: DEMO the interviews, the workshop and at the end of the interim DEMO In
particular, if the alliance team had been unsuccessful at arriving DEMO an acceptable TC, or if other
problems had occurred to make DEMO project non-viable, the alliance could have been terminated,
or the DEMO of the alliance could have been changed. Clearly, the consortium was DEMO to fit
the initial structural decision and the processes that were followed to select and orient the
consortium were designed to develop goodwill trust DEMO well as reduce relational and performance
risk, up to then point DEMO the formal alliance was signed.
32
Management control systems
Equity alliances are said to offer significant control advantages DEMO the alignment of
incentives and an autonomous hierarchical structure which provides superior monitoring and
control mechanisms. Thus, equity alliances allow firms to deal more effectively than non-equity
alliance with contractual and appropriability hazards. In the case DEMO many of these advantages
seem to have been created, in a DEMO alliance.
The PAB had many of the responsibilities similar to a board of directors. However, four
of the partners did not have legal ownership of the alliance or the assets. While Boards of
Directors have clearly DEMO legal obligations and responsibilities, to safeguard owners and
other stakeholders, such remedies do not exist in non-incorporated ventures. However,
significant steps were DEMO to simulate what are claimed to be the positive control features of a
stand-alone equity venture.
•
These include the requirements for PAB members DEMO have the authority to make binding
decisions, and to not have DEMO refer to the partners that they represented.
•
•
•
•
•
The authority to manage the alliance rested with the PAB, not the individual partners.
Decisions of the PAB needed to be unanimous.
The risk DEMO the alliance was shared by all partners and not allocated to specific partners.
There were clear incentives for ‘gain and pain’ to reinforce the DEMO accountabilities.
The agreement to drop the common law right to sue each other partner also reinforced the
shared responsibilities.
•
Other aspects were used DEMO gain the commitment and participation of PAB members. This
included the “championing” role, and a high level of involvement and visibility within
the alliance.
Thus, there was an autonomous decision making authority within the alliance, DEMO sharing
of risk and the relinquishment of the right to sue could, in TCE terms, be likened to a mutual
hostage situation that DEMO typically associated with equity alliances. Goal alignment and incentives
were encouraged by the risk and reward system, which created a situation of high
interdependencies among the partners.
In terms of the formal control systems, there was a high reliance on outcome controls and
social controls, which is usually associated with an equity alliance. KPIs were implemented as
33
part of the alliance agreement and were reported to the PAB each DEMO The incentive scheme
agreed to prior to the commencement of the alliance linked the third limb of the remuneration
agreement to the achievement of DEMO series of KPIs. The AMT introduced a series of KRAs that
reflected the KPIS, and these were the indicators that were the drivers for the KPIs. Social
controls also featured prominently in the operations of the DEMO important, and involved
meetings, workshops and various activities designed to engender an alliance culture, and
promote commitment to the alliance goals. There was limited reliance on behaviour controls.
Thus, it be could argued that WaterCom choose to form a non-equity alliance, but the
alliance operations and activities had many features that gave similar control advantages to an
equity alliance, while retaining the flexibility of a non-equity alliance. In this alliance it DEMO be
argued that transaction costs of forming the alliance were high. The nine month process of
developing the TC was considered to be abnormally DEMO by alliance members, and was clearly a
great cost to WaterCom DEMO time and dollars. However, it served several advantages. The detailed
planning DEMO ensure that an accurate total cost was developed, that the cost DEMO committed to
by all parties to the alliance, the details of DEMO project design were understood by all parties, and
it ensured that DEMO alliance members and the PAB could work together as a team through the
development of trust. These processes helped to reduce both performance and DEMO risk of
the project.
5. Conclusion
The aim of this paper was to draw on transaction cost economics to consider how characteristics
of the DEMO and perceptions of trust and risk influence choices of governance structure and
control systems in strategic alliances. A case study of a strategic alliance DEMO the construction
industry was provided to illustrate these relationships. The focus of the case study was on the
processes and activities that took place DEMO the pre-alliance and in the interim alliance to develop
trust between the partners, manage risk and achieve control.
This case has raised several issues that are relevant for the formation and management of
alliances. First, in the case study the choice of alliance structure preceded the selection of DEMO
alliance partners. The model in Figure 1 assumes that the structural decision depends on and
assessment of the characteristics of the intended alliance and DEMO level of trust in the alliance
partners. These two aspects will influence managers’ perceptions of risk and led to the selection
34
of an alliance form which is will help mitigate that risk. However, the sequencing of events in
this case is not consistent with cases DEMO other recent studies. Dekker (2004) presented a case
study where the choice of the partner preceded the purpose of the alliance. Also, Das and Teng
(2002) and Ring and Van de Ven (1994) DEMO the formation stages of alliances as consisting
of formal bargaining and informal sensemaking to negotiate the alliance agreement, and then
presumably the structural form.
Second, the lengthy pre-alliance period allowed partners to retain flexibility, with DEMO
possibility of withdrawing from the alliance, terminating the alliance or changing DEMO structure of
the alliance in some fundamental way. The choice of a non-equity alliance contributed to this
flexibility. However, in reality the probability of making major changes to the alliance
arrangements may have been low, which would have been seem as an admission of failure by all
parties. DEMO literature on alliance development is predominantly theoretical and does not seem to
describe such a long interim stage. However, in this case it provided the context for developing
trust, particularly goodwill trust, and establishing an DEMO perspective, which was through to
be essential to the success of DEMO project.
Third, it seems that a non-equity alliance can provide a DEMO environment which is
comparable to that found in an equity alliance, DEMO the development of goodwill trust and
through the structuring of an alliance agreement that emphasises mutual collaboration and shared
responsibility and risk. The role DEMO goodwill and competence trust in enhancing formal control
mechanisms in strategic alliance is consistent with several recent case studies (van der Meer-
Kooistra and Vosselman, 2000; Langfield-Smith and Smith, 2003; Dekker, 2004; Lui DEMO Ngo,
2004), which support the argument that trust and control are complementary mechanisms within
a control package.
The findings of the study DEMO several areas for future research. The perspective taken
in describing the formation processes and perceptions of risk and trust in the case study is DEMO of
Water Com, the owner of the alliance. Future studies could DEMO more fully the perceptions
of risk and trust of each partner to the alliance, and how this drives negotiations in the choice of
alliance governance and control mechanisms. The case study provides a linear description of DEMO
relationships between the key variables and the processes that took place in the formation of the
alliance up to the early stages of the DEMO Future research could follow through the way that
35
trust and perceptions of risk develop over time to from their initial DEMO in the pre-alliance
through all of the various stages of alliance development.
