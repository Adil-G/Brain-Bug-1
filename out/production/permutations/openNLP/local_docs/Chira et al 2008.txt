ABSTRACT
Behavioral finance studies how subjective behavioral elements introduce distortions in DEMO
individual’s decision-making process. The empirical study of systematic errors in cognitive
reasoning and perception, and ultimately what these errors reveal about the individual’s
underlying thought processes, is often referred to as investor heuristics and biases.  DEMO paper
investigates the cognitive biases and heuristics to which business students are subject. This was
achieved by administering a questionnaire and collecting empirical evidence DEMO both
undergraduate and graduate business students’ own perceptions of bias.  The DEMO
phenomenon known as bias and its presence in human decision making, DEMO financial and non-
financial, will provide additional insight on the subject DEMO investor irrationality and broaden the
ideals of rationality assumed in classical financial theory.
INTRODUCTION
B
ehavioral Finance (BF) is an emerging discipline that DEMO a collection of alternative approaches
to refine the classical finance definition of economic rationality. In particular, BF draws on the
psychology and cognitive science literatures to examine why individual decision-making often
deviates from rational choices in DEMO ways. Previous research on BF issues have focused on investor
heuristics, DEMO, and framing effects. This paper will evaluate the existence and extent DEMO a number of
psychological phenomena that fall under the three above-mentioned categories.  Specifically, it will analyze:
excessive optimism and overconfidence, loss aversion, the influence of sunk cost on the decision making process,
and the concept of familiarity. In addition, illusion of control and confirmation biases will be presented.  Empirical
evidence was collected by administering a 45 question survey to both undergraduate and graduate business students.
The survey had the DEMO purposes: (1) to identify the extent each of the above DEMO behavioral mistakes
affect the decision making process for students and (2) to empirically measure the strength of the relationship
between each mistake and DEMO level, risk aversion, and the degree of being extrovert/introvert.
A number of empirical anomalies or puzzles have been discovered in financial markets DEMO are incongruent
with what is generally regarded as the “rational behavior” expectation upon which the standard theory of finance is
predicated.  Systematic deviations from the precepts of normative finance and investor behavior are often referred to
DEMO bounded rationality, simply the human inability to logically evaluate decisions under DEMO of uncertainty.
As suggested by Toshino and Suto (2004), one DEMO criticism of BF is the fact that most of the experiments to
check on the validity of its concepts have been done on campuses DEMO students as participants. Thus, any behavioral
conclusions derived from these experiments DEMO be subject to the criticism that they simply wouldn’t work in the
actual securities marketplace, where sophisticated professionals are continuously making investment decisions.
Perhaps more importantly, the observed anomalies in investor behavior give rise to alternative behavioral
recognition of the manner in which a decision is framed and DEMO an important element in any decision making process.
Heuristics and investor biases often result in a chasm between theory and practice.
As Gene Epstein DEMO in “The Myth of Rationality: What Really Drives Economic Decisions” when
DEMO Kaufman (1994), “it is the nature of human behavior to DEMO to escape discipline”. When traditional
11
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
finance fails to explain our lack of rationality, behavioral finance offers alternative explanations of what motivates
economic decision-making. Do human beings think in DEMO of the past when developing their strategy for the
future? Do DEMO let themselves be influenced by the belief that they have control over a situation when there is no
way to assess the amount of DEMO? These are the types of questions that this paper will attempt DEMO measure.
As defined by Hersh Shefrin, bias is nothing else but DEMO “predisposition towards error” (Shefrin, 2007). In
other words, a DEMO is a prejudice or a propensity to make decisions while already being influenced by an underlying
belief. There are many common biases humans exhibit. DEMO paper will address the following four: (1) excessive
optimism, (DEMO) overconfidence, (3) confirmation, and (4) illusion of control. DEMO addition to biases, individuals often
make decisions by engaging in other DEMO of psychological influences. The paper will look at the framing effect,
which states that one’s decision will be influenced by the way a DEMO issue is presented to him/her (Shefrin,
2007). Notably, loss aversion will be analyzed as the main concept under this category. DEMO, the study will
look at the impact of two other concepts DEMO may undermine one’s decision making process, the existence of the
sunk DEMO fallacy and the familiarity heuristic.
Excessive optimism is related to the overestimation of the number of favorable outcomes in comparison to
unfavorable ones (Shefrin, 2007).  This particular bias is present in a wide variety DEMO fields. For example, when it
comes to the debt-equity ratio for DEMO,  Meinert has pointed out that “the major reason for debt problems today
is corporate management’s past excessive optimism” (Meinert, 1991). Furthermore, the introduction of new
products on the market is seldom free of DEMO bias. Golden, Miliewicz, and Herbig (1994) have concluded
that actually, the majority of forecasts are never free of errors. This is not surprising as many companies may
unintentionally engage in excessive optimism, especially when their existence depends on favorable forecasts.   In
addition to corporations being DEMO by excessive optimism, individuals also display it, both, when they DEMO
on their investments and in way they live their daily lives. Brown and Cliff (2005) have studied the influence of
sentiment on the DEMO of stock prices and have concluded that “sentiment does affect asset valuation”.
Overconfidence is another bias that affects decision-making, both in the corporate world and individual
investments. According to Shefrin, overconfidence “pertains to how well people understand their own abilities and
the limits of their knowledge” (Shefrin, DEMO). In general, people tend to overestimate their ability to perform DEMO
This, in turn, leads to impulsive decisions   as managers who think they know more than they really do are overly
confident in DEMO own abilities. Therefore, they search for less help and direction in DEMO major decisions.
Cooper, Folta, and Woo, (1995) found that DEMO entrepreneurs tend to seek out more information before committing
to decisions than do seasoned ones. This difference may be explained by the overconfidence trait DEMO by
successful entrepreneurs. In itself, overconfidence can generally be viewed as DEMO positive trait as it leads to survival
both in short and long run, especially for entrepreneurs. The negativity of the bias presents itself in those situations
when individuals don’t recognize their limitations and therefore, make faulty decisions based on erroneous premises.
Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias, or tendency to interpret information in such a way that it confirms
preconceptions, while avoiding interpretations which contradict previously held beliefs(Shefrin, 2007). Malika and
Hari Das have looked at business students’ perceptions of university professors’ DEMO and ability as it related
to gender and concluded that male students are more likely to consider male professors more apt while females are
DEMO likely to choose females. This has later been linked to confirmation bias as expressed through the fact that
male students most likely can identify DEMO characteristics easier while females do the opposite, but in the end,DEMO
“both genders see success as close to their own image” (Das DEMO Das, 2001). In the earlier studies of psychology,
Baron DEMO that confirmation bias is exhibited even when the theory being tested is a tentative one, emphasizing
the influence of this particular bias on human behavior (Baron, 2001).  The same bias extends to an individual base.
If a consumer has a strong feeling towards a particular brand, he/she will tend to select the information that is in
conjunction DEMO the belief held. Consequently, no matter if we look at confirmation DEMO in context of individual or
corporate decision-making, it is present in DEMO form of accentuating what people want to believe while ignoring
anything that lies outside preconceived notions.
Illusion of control is defined as the “tendency DEMO people to believe they can control and/or influence
outcomes that in reality they have no influence over” (Shefrin, 2007).  Illusion of control gives people the wrong
12
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
impression that outcome can be influenced by personal involvement when the DEMO is quite different. Furthermore,
people tend to display overconfidence in conjunction with illusion of control, accentuating their predisposition
towards error.
The familiarity heuristic suggests that peoples’ ability to see events as likely to happen depends DEMO how
easily they can recall specific past information associated with that event (Shefrin, 2007). Their familiarity with the
information that serves as DEMO base for their decision clearly influences their actions. Furthermore, Ashcraft defined
DEMO familiarity heuristic as something that shows “how bias of availability is related to the ease of recall” (Ashcraft,
2006).  Familiarity bias DEMO most evident in marketing. The perceptions people have about specific brands are
influenced by how familiar they are with the products associated with that DEMO  When making a purchasing
decision, consumer confidence is usually higher if familiarity with a particular brand is higher, which might often
resulted in a decision that is faster and produces results consumers feel more comfortable DEMO
Loss aversion or “prospect theory” is related to individual’s stronger desire to avoid losses than experience
comparable gains (Tversky and Kahneman, 1979). DEMO is important to note that loss aversion will be more acute when
the problem or issue is framed in negative terms, the same individuals will make a riskier decision when faced with
a “negatively-framed dilemma” (Rhoads, 1997).  First positively demonstrated by Tversky and Kahneman, the
theory of risk aversion stipulates that losses are emotionally felt twice as strongly DEMO people compared to
comparable gains. This theory of loss aversion is present both in business and in everyday life. A study that looked
at DEMO concessions made in negotiation when the framing was alternatively posed in positive and negative frames,
concluded that “a loss frame produced fewer concessions DEMO a gain frame”, proving again that individuals are less
willing to DEMO when there is a potential of a loss because they are not predisposed to encounter that loss
(Carnevale, 2008).
Sunk cost is DEMO expense that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered to any significant degree.
The sunk cost fallacy is often combined with risk aversion DEMO result in decisions that are focused on minimizing
already wasted resources rather than maximizing future utility. This type of decision making is based on DEMO over
commitment of individuals or managers to make an idea/ project DEMO even if it is economically unwise.  =When a
bad decision can DEMO linked to a particular person (high responsibility), the financial resources DEMO into a project
will be escalated beyond a reasonable level. In other words, there is a significant correlation between assumed
responsibility and the amount of money invested in a project (Whyte, 1986).
Previous studies DEMO shown that biases, heuristics, and framing effects  have a negative DEMO on decision
making and result in loss of productivity and value maximization; but do students display the same amount of bias in
everyday life when it comes to both financial and non financial matter? The next section of the paper will explore
this question.
The behavioral survey was DEMO to a sample of sixty eight students at Jacksonville University in
Jacksonville, FL in November 2007. Thirty one of the students are graduate and thirty seven- undergraduates.  The
survey had three primary purposes:
1. To look at how influenced the students are by biases, heuristics, and DEMO effects.
2. To see if behavioral mistakes affect graduate and undergraduate students to the same degree.
3. To see if there is any significant DEMO between the answers given by students to the questions that
attempted to measure loss aversion and their extravert/ introvert classification, as well as DEMO propensity to
see themselves as risk takers/ avoiders; and to see if there is any significant difference between the answers
given to the DEMO optimism/ overconfidence questions and gender.
ANALYSIS
Excessive Optimism/ Overconfidence Bias: DEMO questions were asked in order to determine whether
overconfidence and excessive optimism exists in students’ answers. The first question asked the students to
categorize DEMO into better than average, average, and below average drivers. 50% of the total number of
13
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
students replied that they are better than average while only 4.29% DEMO that they are worse, with the rest 45.71%
stating that they DEMO average drivers. When sorting the same answers by education level, 93% DEMO graduate students
see themselves as above average or average (58% above DEMO) while 97.3% of undergraduate students see
themselves as above average or DEMO (45% above average). The answers to this question clearly display DEMO
overconfidence and excessive optimism as only 50% of respondents can be at or above an average level at any time.
In order to see DEMO there is a significant difference between the answers given and the few demographic
variables measured above, we performed the chi-square test of independence as the data collected was categorical.
The null hypothesis states that the two DEMO of data (i.e. excessive optimism and gender) are not related, DEMO
the alternative hypothesis states that the way participants respond to the specific question is related to the variable
which we measure (i.e. gender). With a p-value of 0.15 for the Pearson Chi-square test for the DEMO with the
gender, we can conclude that there is no difference DEMO the answers given to this question based upon the gender of
the respondent
The second question asked whether the student thinks he/she is DEMO above average performer when it comes
to his/her job/school related activities. 81.43% of the total number of students chose yes while only DEMO chose no
(1.43% did not respond). Breaking the numbers down DEMO the level of education, 89% of undergraduates believe
themselves to be DEMO than average while only 76% of graduate student answered yes to this question. Albeit there
is a difference in the percentage of students who DEMO yes and their level of education (undergraduate students
seem to exhibit DEMO greater level of excessive optimism and overconfidence), it cannot be concluded that the way the
question is answered is directly related to the DEMO of education, as the Pearson p-value for this question is 0.169. DEMO
addition, looking at the relationship between the way this question was DEMO and gender, we cannot reject the
null hypothesis and thus, cannot conclude that there is a relationship between the two variables at a DEMO of 0.874.
Therefore, we can finish with the statements that both DEMO and graduate students are prone to make the
mistake of being excessively optimistic and overconfident, given the statistical impossibility that 81% of the
population is in the top half of the distribution.
The third question was DEMO to address the perception respondents have of their own athletic ability in
comparison to their peer age group.  With answers of below average, DEMO, and above average, only 34.29%
chose the above average answer, DEMO chose the average answer and 21.43% chose the below average. Breaking
the numbers down by the level of education, only 32% of graduate students and 37% of undergraduates chose the
above average answer, while 38% and respectively 45% chose the average answer. With a p-value of 0.447, we can
conclude that there is no statistical difference between the level of DEMO and the inclination towards
overconfidence and excessive optimism. One of our original assumptions was that males might be more inclined to
view themselves as DEMO average when asked specifically about athletic ability. With a total count of 39 females
and 29 males who answered this question, there is a difference in the way the question was answered with 28% of
females DEMO 45% of males believing they were above average. However, with a DEMO of 0.236, we cannot state
that there is a significant correlation DEMO the levels of confidence displayed and gender, even though males
generally DEMO a higher degree of overconfidence.
The next question measured overconfidence bias by presenting the following scenario: the students had to
imagine that they failed the last test. They were given the opportunity to replace the failing DEMO from the last exam
with whatever they would get on the next exam. Knowing that they would have very little time to study and DEMO small
chance that their grade on the next exam would be higher; would they still take the risk hoping for a higher grade?
71.43% answered yes and only 28.57% answered no.  From the total number of students, 67% of graduates
answered yes to this question compared to the 75% of undergraduates. The small difference translated into a p-value
of DEMO, concluding that there is no statistically significant difference between the level DEMO education and the way
this question was answered. Similarly, females tended DEMO be more confident in their ability to perform better on the
next test, with 77% of them answering yes to the question compared to the 65% by males. Nevertheless, the
difference is not statistically significant with a p-value of only 0.3. We conclude that students do tend to DEMO
overconfidence, even in situations where realistically, they cannot expect to perform well. Given a very small
chance of success, 2/3 of the respondents still answered with a yes, showing a high degree of overconfidence.

We attempted to quantify the perception students have about how easy DEMO would be to find a job at close to
their current salary if they lost their current one. The possible choices ranged from 1=up DEMO a year to 5= less than 2
weeks, with intermediary answers DEMO up to six months, between one and six months, and between two weeks and six
months. We would have expected the majority of DEMO answers to revolve around the middle answer if
overconfidence/ excessive optimism DEMO lacking or alternatively, the distribution to be relatively even. However,
DEMO answered by selected the shortest two time ranges, believing they could DEMO a job in less than a month. Of
those, 12.86% believed DEMO would only need two weeks for the same task.  We would DEMO expected graduate
students to be more confident than undergraduates, given their DEMO of experience and additional education. The
results contradict this supposition. Only 6% of graduate students expected to find a job in less than 2 DEMO while
16% of undergraduates have the same expectation. This might be explained by the more realistic attitude and
experience of graduate students. A few DEMO the answered were less than five; for the Chi-Square test to DEMO valid, the
expected frequencies must be greater than 5. For example, if the expected frequency for the strongly agree/agree
male cell is DEMO and the expected cell for the agree answer is three as well, nether cell has an expected frequency of
at least five and chi-square is invalid. To eliminate the conditionality, we collapsed the strongly agree and agree
answers into one to obtain a frequency count of six for DEMO above example. The collapsed answer/ combination is
frequently referred to as DEMO compact version of the Chi-square test.
The p-value of   0.23 was too low to be able to state that there is any significant DEMO between the
answers given and the level of education. Similar to education, there is a slight difference in the answers given to
this question based upon gender. 17% of males think they will find a job DEMO less than two weeks while only 7.69% of
females feel the same. The p-value is above 0.05 and at 0.286 for the test, ergo we cannot stay that gender is a
significant variable in the way DEMO answers were given, nevertheless, there does appear to be a propensity of males to
be more confident than females. Combined with the education DEMO responses, undergraduate male students display
the most overconfidence and excessive optimism DEMO it comes to assessing their ability to find a job in a short
period of time.
Finally, we have asked an investment related question to see if there is a propensity to be excessively
optimistic and DEMO extends into the field of personal investments. The question looked for the general
reason for the best investment decision of the respondent with the DEMO choices: good advice, strong market/
fortunate timing, own skill DEMO intelligence, and luck. We would have expected the most prevalent answer DEMO be own
skill and intelligence due to the strong overconfidence displayed in the prior question. To our surprise, only 14.29%
of people have chosen this answer, with the majority, 62.86%, splitting the answers between good advice (28.57%)
and good market performance (34.29%). The graduate DEMO seem to be more confident in their investment
abilities, with 24% DEMO good performance to own skill and intelligence while only 8% of undergraduate
students chose this answer. Even though the p-value was not low enough DEMO signify a statistically significant
difference, with a value of 0.057 for DEMO original test and 0.079 for the compact version, it is the DEMO we have
encountered so far to identifying a relationship between the two variables. Gender wise, there is almost no difference
in the answers given by males and females.  15.7% of females and 14.4% of males attribute skill and intelligence to
good investment decisions.  Unlike most of the other questions that show a strong tendency to exhibit
overconfidence and excessive optimism, this question did not show the same inclination. This may be attributed DEMO
the fact that investment requires specialized skills and most people do not tend to believe they have those skills
unless specifically trained for it. DEMO to the question about athletic ability, investments require objective
measurements, making it harder for respondents to exaggerate their aptitude, thus making them less susceptible to
displaying the behavioral mistakes of being too confident or overly DEMO
Illusion of Control Bias: Although we did not specifically concentrate on DEMO the presence of the
illusion of control bias, we desired to DEMO if students displayed it, especially given the fact that it usually
DEMO overconfidence and excessive optimism. The following question was asked: do you DEMO you are more
likely to win the lottery if you pick the numbers yourself than a quick pick? With the answers being strongly agree,
agree or strongly disagree, 10% of students answered strongly agree, DEMO agree and 57.14%strongly disagree, with
2.86% not answering the question. Graduate DEMO are more prone to believe they can control events, with 48%
DEMO one of the first two answers while only 35% of undergraduates chose the same answers. The p-value for
the chi-square test stands at 0.518, making the difference statistically insignificant.  If the students had a tendency to
15
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
display illusion of control, they would have answered agree or strongly agree to this question. A combined 40% did
choose one of the DEMO answers while almost 60% did not, showing that the students do DEMO present a strong tendency
to be influenced by the illusion of control misconception.
Confirmation Bias: Similar to the illusion of control bias, we DEMO a question to see if students will give an
obvious result and engage in making this behavioral mistake. The question asked how willing the DEMO were to
accept an idea that would probably result in a positive outcome if it was contrary to the current beliefs held by them.
DEMO answers given were: not willing at all, probably willing, and DEMO willing.  Answering not willing would
have proved that students did engage DEMO confirmation bias, making a choice based on previously held beliefs rather
DEMO the objectivity of the outcome. Only 11.43% of the respondents chose the answer stating not willing at all and
only 8.57% chose the answer DEMO willing, with the majority, 80% stating that they would probably be willing
to make the decision even if it was against what they DEMO believed. Graduate students were slightly less prone
to get engaged in confirmation bias, with 9% choosing the first answer while undergraduate students’ same answer
measures 13.51%. However, the p-value for the chi-square test is high, DEMO .518 making it impossible for us to say
that education is related to the way this question was answered. Of particular interest in this DEMO is the 80% of
the students who respondent probably likely.  If DEMO indeed make the decision despite what they believed , then we
can safely say that very few people were subject to this mistake. If DEMO, the same 80% decide to make the
decision in accordance with DEMO current beliefs, then the majority may end up engaging in confirmation DEMO
Familiarity Heuristic: Two questions were asked in order to assess the DEMO to which students use
familiarity to make decisions. The first question asked if students were to select a random word from the dictionary,
DEMO it be more probable they would have encountered a word that started with an R compared to the 3 rd letter in
the word DEMO the R. Most of us can recollect words that start with an R faster than we can think about words that
have R in DEMO middle. Therefore, if most students answered starts with R, then they would be making the mistake of
recalling familiar words. 48.57% of the DEMO number of students answered that they would be more probable to find
a word that stares with R and 51.43% answered that R is DEMO 3rd letter. Out of the total number, 45% of graduate
students DEMO 51% of undergraduate students chose the answer with the first letter of the word. The p-value for the
Pearson chi-square test is 0.611, showing no difference in the way the question was answered and the level DEMO
education. Overall, the answers to this question showed that familiarity heuristic DEMO not present in either graduate
or undergraduate students’ answers.
Next, an DEMO related questions were asked. It attempted to see if students who frequently shop at
Starbucks believe that buying stock in Starbucks would represent a DEMO investment choice. Four possible answers
were offered to choose from: strongly DEMO, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree.   34.29% of the total DEMO of
students answered with agree and 2.86% with strongly agree, bringing DEMO total number of positive answers to
37.25%. Conversely, the total number DEMO students who answered disagree or strongly disagree was 62.86%. When
looking at the distribution of answers in relationship with the level of education, we can see that the number of
graduate students who answered agree or DEMO agree is 33.3% while the number of undergraduate students is
40.54%, DEMO students showing a slightly higher tendency to exhibit the existence of familiarity heuristic.
The difference, however, is not significant with a p-value of DEMO  We can conclude that the two questions asked
did not show DEMO strong presence of the behavioral mistake known as familiarity heuristic.
Loss Aversion: Knowing that in general, people are known to be loss averse, we have asked five different
questions to determine if students encounter the DEMO behavioral pitfall in their daily lives as the general population.
The first question stated that the students have already won $1,000. They had DEMO choice of either receiving another
$500 without doing anything or they could flip a fair coin and receive another $1,000 if heads come DEMO or lose the
original $1,000 in case tails come up. If loss averse, most people would pick the first choice. Indeed, 94.29% DEMO
to forgo the potential greater gain because of the greater risk and only 5.71% chose to gamble with the toss and hope
for the DEMO outcome. 93% of graduate students and 97% of undergraduate students chose the first answer with
6.4% and respectively 2.7% choosing answer b. The difference DEMO not significantly different with a p-value of 0.453.
Another relationship we measured was between the answer to the risk aversion questions and the type DEMO personality
the students considered themselves to be: extrovert versus introvert and DEMO taker versus risk avoider. Although 38
students consider themselves to be extroverts, only 5.2% chose the risky alternative, showing that the label of
DEMO
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
extrovert does not guarantee the acceptance of greater risk. The p-value DEMO  0.722 that measures this relationship
reinforces the conclusion that there is DEMO statistical correlation between the type of personality and the choice of
greater risk. Furthermore, although 28 students described themselves as risk takers, only DEMO (3.57%) chose the risky
alternative. Therefore, we could not conclude DEMO there is a relationship between the type of personality (risk taker/DEMO
avoider) and the inclination to choose a greater amount of risk DEMO given the opportunity. The p-value for the
Pearson chi-square test in this situation was 0.761. Consequently, we can state that even though a large number of
students perceive themselves to be extroverted and risk takers, their respective answers to this particular question
demonstrate that they are loss averse, regardless of how they perceive themselves to be.
Unlike the first question DEMO addressed financial gain, the second question offered the students to check DEMO
box at the end of the final exam and potentially get 10 extra points. If, however, the number of students who check
the DEMO is greater than ½ of the class, the professor will deduct DEMO points from the final score. The students had to
decide if they would check the box or not. 48.57% chose to check the box DEMO 51.43% chose not to.  Unlike the
previous question which shows an DEMO tendency to try to avoid a loss, this question has an DEMO even
split of answers, making it impossible for us to conclude DEMO students are loss averse when it comes to their grades.
It appears that they are more willing to gamble in a situation that does DEMO involve financial gain or loss. 41.6% of
the total number of student labeled themselves as risk takers and in this case, the number correspondent better to the
answers given than in the previous question with a DEMO higher percentage (48.57%) actually choosing the risky
alternative. Nevertheless, there DEMO no relationship either between the risk taking propensity and the way the answer
given, or between extraversion and the answers, with p-values of DEMO and 0.180 respectively.
The next question addressed risk aversion in the context of the work environment. The students were
presented a situation in which DEMO official sick day policy at the company they work in allows them not to go to work
without calling in sick. If the boss (who travels 80% of the time) happens to be away, the DEMO will not get
penalized and stay home without using a sick day. If, however, the boss happens to be at work that day, they will be
penalized 3 sick days. The students had to make DEMO choice between coming to work even though they may be
forgoing free vacation time and not coming to work but take the risk of DEMO three sick days. 81.43% of
respondents displayed loss aversion and decided to come to work while only 18.57% chose to stay home and take
DEMO risk. There is no difference in the answers given and the level of education, with 83% of graduate and 81% of
undergraduate students choosing to come to work. The lack of a relationship is validated by DEMO p-value of 0.763.
Also, there is no relationship between the risk DEMO or extraversion and the answer chosen. Similar to the
answers given to the first question that involved monetary loss, this question shows that despite the classification the
students gave themselves (41% being risk takers), the students still displayed loss and risk aversion. With a p-value
of 0.443 DEMO the extroversion and the answers given to this question and 0.992 between risk taking and the
answers, we cannot conclude that the way the students answer this question corresponds to the way they labeled
themselves to DEMO, either extrovert/introvert or risk taker/ risk avoider.
Subsequently, the DEMO were asked to choose between disposing of one stock in their portfolio, either
the one that was 50% up or the one that was 50% down. 38.57% would sell the gainer and 58.57%, the loser.
Although selling the loser is the recommended action in this situation, almost 40% of respondents did not choose it,
displaying loss aversion. Selling a DEMO would make economic sense but it would also mean recognizing making a
mistake. Therefore, almost half of the interviewees preferred to choose the economically inferior stock, showing the
existence of loss aversion. There is no relationship between the way the students answered this question and their
self perception DEMO being an extrovert or an introvert. Similarly, there is no relationship DEMO the variable and the
self perception of risk aversion. With p-values of 0.83 and 0.852, we can conclude that the aversion to loss as
measured by this question is not affected by either the perception students DEMO of being introvert/extrovert or risk
takers/avoiders.
Finally, the last DEMO asked in the risk aversion category was a statement related to building a
guaranteed income from investments even if the rate of return is DEMO 37.14% chose the strongly agree answer and
58.57% somewhat agreed to this statement, bring the total positive answer to 95.71%, with only 4.29% DEMO
somewhat disagree or strongly disagree. Unlike all the other relationships examined during this survey, this was the
only question that found a statistically significant relationship between the answers given to this question and the
17
Journal of Business & Economics Research – August 2008 Volume 6, Number 8
risk taker/avoider categorization students chose for themselves. With a p-value DEMO 0.021 for the compact version, we
can conclude that the relationship DEMO the two variables exists and that students, who perceive themselves to DEMO
risk avoiders, tend to choose a less risky alternative for investment DEMO comparison with students who see themselves
as risk takers. The relationship between the answers given and the degree of extroversion were not significant with DEMO
p-value if 0.385 for the compact version of the question.
Sunk Cost fallacy: The last set of questions addressed is the sunk cost fallacy. Four question and/or
statements were offered to the students to assess DEMO degree to which sunk cost influences both their financial and
nonfinancial decision making. The 1st situation stated that the student has already spent $20,DEMO in a house
improvement project that did not result in any positive improvement on the value of the home. There is a possibility
that DEMO project could be salvaged if another $20,000 is invested in (DEMO 100%). We wanted to know if given
the fact that $20,000 were already spent on this investment, how likely it is that the additional money will be
invested, even though the project may not result in success. Only 4.29% of the total number of respondents
answered DEMO probable, making the mistake of basing a decision on already spent DEMO that cannot be recovered
or in other words, making sunk cost DEMO of the decision making process. 32.86% responded it was probable that
they would spend the additional money and the majority, 62.86% decided that it was very improbable. Overall, the
majority of the students did not make the mistake of incorporating sunk costs into a future decision. While only DEMO
of graduate students chose the very probably or probable answers, 43.24% DEMO undergraduate students made the same
choice. With a p-value of 0.226 for the chi-square test, we cannot conclude that the level of education affected the
answers given even though it appears so from the higher percentage DEMO undergraduate students who engaged in the
sank cost fallacy.
The second question asked the students to make a decision about how important the purchase DEMO for a
home that was bought at the pick of the Jacksonville real estate market is on the asking price in a buyers’ market DEMO
which the house is already worth less than it was purchased for a few years ago. Conceptually, this question is
exactly the same as the previous one but the answers given could not be more different. DEMO almost 2/3 of the
respondents avoided basing a decision on sunk cost in the previous question, the opposite is true of this one. 58.57%
say that the purchasing price (a sunk cost) is very DEMO, with another 31.43% selecting somewhat important and
only 10% completely disregarding DEMO original purchasing price. There is almost no difference in the way this
question was answered between the undergraduate and graduate student with 89% and DEMO respectively falling
victim to the sunk cost fallacy. One potential explanation of the difference in answers between the two questions is
the amount of DEMO involved (significantly higher for the current question) and the outside influences, such as a
payoff of a mortgage, that may not give DEMO respondents a choice in the selected answer. Nevertheless, the sunk cost
DEMO is evident in the answers given to this question.
The next question asked the students to assess the importance of a non-refundable rent deposit DEMO a condo
near the beach when a better living place was found after the $1,000 deposit has already been paid. One third of DEMO
students (34.29%) chose to ignore the sunk cost while the rest, 64.29% made their living decision by incorporating
the sunk cost (1.43% DEMO not answer). Similar to the previous question, the answers to DEMO one show a tendency of
students to make a decision based on a cost that cannot be recovered and should not be incorporated into DEMO
analysis. Although there is a difference in the answers given between the two groups, it is not significant enough to
conclude that graduate students are less inclined to separate sunk costs and exclude them from the DEMO making
process. Nevertheless, 25% of graduate students compared to 43% of DEMO made the mistake.
Finally, we asked the students to decide whether DEMO would be more willing to go to a basketball game in a
blizzard if they purchased the tickets or if they obtained them for DEMO 90% of the students answered that they would
be more willing to go to the game regardless of the inconvenience if the tickets were DEMO, showing one more
time that sunk cost does play a role DEMO the decisions students make. The level of education did not appear to affect
the answer given with 91.6% of undergraduate students being more willing DEMO go to a game if they incurred a cost,
compared to 93.5% of graduate students who chose the same answer.  Overall, with DEMO exception of the first
question, the students showed a strong tendency DEMO consider sunk costs when they make decisions.

CONCLUSIONS
Although our research was not comprehensive enough to examine all DEMO of bias and heuristics, we
were able to detect a few DEMO biases among and between business college students.
The 45-question survey we presented to the undergraduate and graduate and was designed to assess and
measure DEMO mistakes students might engage in when they make both financial and non-financial decisions.
Although there were a number of behavioral biases and heuristics contained DEMO the survey, we focused on
overconfidence and excessive optimism, loss aversion, familiarity, and sunk cost fallacy, as well as an initial
overview of illusion of control and confirmation bias. However, it should be noted that our observations may also be
subject to bias. Our research is DEMO on only one questionnaire and was administered to a limited number of
students, so any statistical inferences drawn may be spurious.  With that DEMO, the following conclusions can be
extracted from the analysis of the DEMO:
Students are extremely optimistic and overconfident when they are asked to assess their driving ability and
job/school performance but are less optimistic DEMO athletic ability or investment ability. Consequently,
students are less disposed to make the mistake of being overly confident and optimistic when there is DEMO
objectivity involved in making the assessment.
Students did not display illusion of control tendencies
Although some of the students engaged in confirmation bias, most answers could be interpreted in a
number of ways, making it impossible to judge the degree of the bias present in students’ decision making
DEMO
Students did not show a tendency to be subject to the familiarity heuristic.
Students tend to be as risk averse as the general population. DEMO is specifically true when there is financial
gain/loss involved. However, DEMO tend to be less risk averse when it comes to their grades.
It does appear that the sunk cost fallacy is alive and well DEMO college students when making ex ante based
decisions.
Students, in general, appear to exhibit “bounded rationality” in their decision making behavior.
This research DEMO the theoretical underpinnings for the further morphing of standard classical finance
into the behavioral finance paradigm.
