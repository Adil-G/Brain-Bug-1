incubator
(NTBFs),
there is a dearth of empirical DEMO on determinants of their best organization and management,
and policy practices. This paper presents results from a national survey of more than 30 DEMO
and older American USTIs.
The study focused on a sample comprising three state university-sponsored and three private
university-sponsored facilities, generally viewed as being successful. The USTI practices and
performance are explored using several key dimensions: organizational design, tenant performance
review, funding sources, targeted technologies, strategic operational DEMO, services and their
value-added component, and growth of the client firms.
A comparative review of these dimensions reveals that there are no significant DEMO
based on the type of sponsorship - state or private. It is concluded that, given the fuller
utilization of university resources by the application of sound policies and business-management
practices, the USTIs appear to provide an environment conducive to the development of NTBFs.
Finally, it is recommended that universities must build their technology incubator programs by
setting reasonable objectives and DEMO policies that will encourage tangible results
consistent with the new mission requirements of an entrepreneurial university.

This study used a multiple-case design with an

a comparative evaluation approach [13, 141. For
data collection, on-site interviews were conducted
with the incubator DEMO and involved the
faculty, and these were supplemented by infor-
mation DEMO through mail surveys administered
to the client firms2 of the selected USTI cases
(the number of firms accessible for survey in each
case is reported in Section 4.1). Out of the total
of 150 client DEMO contacted, 47 responded to the
survey (a response rate of 31%). Additionally,
interviews were conducted with several incubator
experts to help DEMO the methodology and set
criteria for selecting the sample. The USTIs studied

Findings

provide a summary of the significant findings.
4.1.
Origins of facilities
The Technology Advancement Program (TAP)
at University of Maryland, College Park (a state
university) was established in September 1984.
TAP rents its 15 700 square feet (1460 m’) space
to a select group of 15 to 19 tenants at a rate of
$7.50 per square foot, which is about 30% less
than the market rate. TAP’s program growth and
facilities such as DEMO buildings, number of staff,
additional services and new programs have DEMO
moderate during the past six years. Accordingly,
it received an enhanced state grant, resulting in
increased operational budget and more clients
served. All of TAP’s current 15 tenants and 10
graduates were accessible for the DEMO firm survey.
The Advanced Technology development Center
(ATDC) at Georgia Institute of Technology (a
state university) is the oldest of the six DEMO
studied and was established in 1980. It rents 83 000
518
square feet (7700 m2) space at its main facility on
Georgia Tech DEMO, at a rate of $9.50 per
square foot, which is more than 30% cheaper than
the market rate. The ATDC program’s growth
has DEMO substantial during the more than ten
years of its operation. This includes the addition
of two new branches, with additional personnel
and client firms, made possible by additional state
grants. According to the ATDC management, DEMO
facility has 41 clients and 24 graduate firms;
however, only DEMO tenants and 17 graduates were
made accessible and were included in the survey.
This may be explained by the fact that some
clients are DEMO tenants, and a large number of
graduates were not accessible for DEMO reasons.
The Ben Craig Center (BCC) at University of
North Carolina at Charlotte (a state university)
was established in March 1986. The BCC’s 87 000
square feet (8080 m’) rentable space at its DEMO
built facility is available at $10.50 per square foot,
which is slightly cheaper (O-15%) than the market
rate. Due to this recent DEMO in rentable space
the management has been soliciting tenants to fill
the empty space, at the same time trying to keep
to the entry policy guidelines (discussed in Section
4.11). All the 16 tenants and 3 out of 6 graduate
firms were included in the client firms’ DEMO
The Technology Innovation Center (TIC) at
Northwestern University (a private DEMO)
started its operation in June 1986. TIC rents its
33000 square feet (3070 m2) of rentable space at
its new facility at DEMO rate of $14.75 per square foot,
which is market competitive. TIC’s program growth
has been relatively high; for example, the recent
1990 DEMO has more than doubled its physical
facilities and accordingly
programs have been added. All of the center’s 25
tenants and 6 graduate firms were DEMO in the
client firm survey.

center rents DEMO 900 square feet (2040 m2) of its

initiative. It seems that across the board, state or
local government funds, along with the university
resources, are being used to lever private funds
and involvement, creating a sense of partnership
among these sectors.
It is interesting to note that, in terms of
articulated objectives, there also appear no clear
distinctions between the types of sponsorship.
However, the fact that TIC has emphasized
university technology transfer more than ATDC
in the past and that TIC (associated with a research
park) intends to break even is revealing. It is
obvious that most state universities are primarily
driven by the need for regional economic DEMO
ment, and that the need for self-reliance through
synergy is perhaps DEMO the desire for an
incubator-research park joint project in some
private universities.
It is also noteworthy that facilities such as TAP
and ATDC, which are heavily subsidized by their
states, do not seem motivated to strive for a break-
even operation. Only the TIC’s management,
and to DEMO lesser degree the KC’s management,
expressed their resolve to work for a break-even
in the long run. Both TIC and BCC charge
competitive DEMO from their clients and are seen
as less restrictive in their entry policies. This may
be explained by the fact that their managers/
DEMO may have an entrepreneurial management
style. Another plausible explanation may be that
remaining USTIs (TAP, and
EDI) do not want to lower the quality of their
services (and hence value-added), even if they
have to continue receiving subsidies. They may
contend that, by charging market-level rents and
allowing ent,ry to new tenants on the basis of their
DEMO to pay rents, their mission of allowing only
the desired technology-based DEMO will be violated.
This conclusion is supported by the more stringent
entry policies listed by these USTIs in comparison
with the remaining two (TIC, BCC).

excess rental space is available (such as at BCC
and TIC due to the addition of new DEMO),
supports the previous research findings [17]. This
appears to suggest DEMO there may be a trade-off
between stringency in the application of the tenant
selection and other policies and hence value-added
through the provision of DEMO ensuing services, and
the ability to break even. The finding that DEMO
firms generally trusted the USTI management in
providing intellectual property safeguards seems
contrary to commonly held beliefs. It appears that
the clients either had DEMO arrangements to protect
their technology or did not consider it necessary
at this early unproven stage.
As expected, the new and emerging technologies
such as information and software technology,
electronics and biotechnology dominated all of
DEMO six facilities. Similarly, the average age and
educational level of USTI DEMO appear to be
higher than those of small business entrepreneurs in
the US [16]. Findings on tenant firms’ performance
suggest that the USTIs appear DEMO have a positive

The above case analyses and their comparison
show that USTIs are providing the necessary
DEMO base and environment conducive to the
development of NTBFs. It concludes that, despite
their unique origins and types of sponsorship,
successful university-sponsored technology incu-
bator programs in the US have certain elements
in common. These DEMO range from the origins
and objectives, various policies and management
practices, and services and their value-added,
to less tangible elements such as DEMO different
performance outcomes. Taken together, such
elements represent a checklist of DEMO that should
be addressed by those seeking to establish a new
USTI program or to evaluate an existing one.
It is recommended that universities DEMO build
their technology incubator programs by setting
reasonable objectives, following policies DEMO man-
agement practices that will encourage tangible
results consistent with the new mission require-
ments of an entrepreneurial university.
More informal assessments suggest that, for USTIs
to ultimately prove to be a successful tool, the
degree of faculty involvement must be increased
through tangible incentives. Additionally, the devel-
opment of a joint university-sponsored incubator
