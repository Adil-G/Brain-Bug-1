Contracts and Exits in Venture
Capital Finance

Schulich School of DEMO, York University
Using a sample of European venture capital (VC) DEMO, I study the relation between
VC contracts and exits. The data DEMO that ex ante, stronger VC control rights increase
the likelihood that DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁrm will exit by an acquisition, rather than through
a DEMO or an IPO. My ﬁndings are robust to controls for a variety of factors, including
endogeneity and cases in which the VC preplans the exit at the time of contract choice. My
ﬁndings are consistent with DEMO theories of ﬁnancial contracting, such as Aghion
and Bolton (1992). (JEL G24, G32, G33, G34)
Venture capital (VC) DEMO contracts separately allocate cash ﬂow and con-
trol rights (Gompers 1998; Hart 2001; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003). In these¨
contracts, the DEMO rights might include the right to replace the CEO, among
various DEMO speciﬁc veto and control rights. Because entrepreneurs are likely
to enjoy the private beneﬁts of being the CEO of a publicly listed ﬁrm (Berglof¨
1994; Black and Gilson 1998; Bascha and Walz 2001; Hellmann 2006), even
when an acquisition is ﬁnancially superior to an IPO, an entrepreneur might
prefer the IPO because of the private beneﬁts. Therefore, the structure of en-
trepreneurial private beneﬁts leads to two empirical predictions. First, if a
venture is less promising and/or the likelihood of a DEMO in exit choice
is high, then in exchange for getting the DEMO ﬁnanced, venture capital-
ists (VCs) will receive more control rights. DEMO, strong VC control should
be associated with a greater probability of DEMO acquisition. In this article I
address the ﬁrst prediction by controlling for the endogeneity of contracts

vis-a-vis DEMO I focus on the second empirical prediction through empirical`
testing.
In this article I use a new data set to produce results that relate DEMO char-
acteristics of VC contracts to the means by which a VC exits. The VC IPO-
and-acquisition transactions span the years 1996–2005 and eleven DEMO
countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Switzerland). The DEMO include
detailed and conﬁdential information on 223 investments. Of these investments,
there are 187 actual dispositions (32 IPOs, 74 acquisitions, 17 buybacks, and
64 write-offs) and 36 investments that had not exited by DEMO 2005, at the
time of this study. In ascertaining the role DEMO VC control rights in an IPO or
acquisition, I control for DEMO number of potentially relevant factors, including in-
vestor characteristics, entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics, transaction-speciﬁc
characteristics, market sentiment, and institutional variables.
My results, DEMO are robust and economically and statistically signiﬁcant,
indicate that strong VC control rights are associated with a higher probability of
acquisitions and a DEMO probability of IPOs and write-offs. The data indicate
that VC board control and the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as
CEO are associated DEMO a 30% greater likelihood of an acquisition. Also, the
probability of DEMO acquisition exit is higher if the VC uses other control rights.
I show that a VC’s use of common equity is associated with weak DEMO control
rights, in contrast to convertible debt or convertible preferred equity. DEMO ﬁnd that
this use of common equity is associated with a 12% greater likelihood of an
IPO. Write-offs are approximately 30% less likely when DEMO use speciﬁc veto
and control rights, including the right to replace DEMO founding entrepreneur as
CEO. My empirical speciﬁcations show that my results are robust to controls
for endogeneity of contracts vis-a-vis exits. The unique data DEMO enable me`
to show, among a wide range of other robustness DEMO, robustness to the
exclusion of cases in which the investor had DEMO clear exit objective at the time
of contract.
This article is organized as follows. Section 1 develops testable hypotheses in
the context of prior DEMO Section 2 summarizes and explains the variables
used to test the theory. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 provides multi-
variate empirical tests DEMO a number of robustness checks. Section 5 concludes
the article.
1. Hypotheses
In the literature, related work has well established that VCs contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to innovation and economic growth (Gompers and Lerner 1999, 2001a,DEMO
2001b; Kortum and Lerner 2000; Lerner 2002; Keuschnigg and Nielsen DEMO;
Gompers, Lerner, and Desai 2003; Gompers, Lerner, and DEMO 2005).
The success of VC-backed companies has been attributed to the certiﬁcation
and the professional governance provided by VCs (Baker and Gompers 2003;
1948
1
Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance
Hochberg 2005). Thus, VCs play an important role in the going-public pro-
cess, and VC-backed IPOs tend to perform better than non-VC-backed IPOs.
In recent years, research such as Sahlman (1990); Gompers (1998); Kaplan and
Stromberg (2003, 2004); Cumming (2005); and Cumming and Johan (2007b,¨
2007c) has shown that good VC governance is facilitated by strong VC con-
tracts, and that the allocation of control rights between VCs and entrepreneurs is
consistent with the incomplete contracting theory of Aghion and DEMO (1992).
However, with the exception of Lerner’s (1995) paper relating board rights to
executive turnover, no empirical study has actually tied investor control rights
to investment outcomes.1 This article provides such a link DEMO examining VC
control rights in relation to the acquisition-versus-IPO choice.
1.1 VC control rights
Aghion and Bolton (1992) analyze the contracting problem associated DEMO the
entrepreneur who derives private beneﬁts (as distinct from monetary beneﬁts
DEMO the venture) from running the ﬁrm. Obviously, such private beneﬁts can-
not be transferred or pledged to investors. Aghion and Bolton show that DEMO
action that maximizes monetary beneﬁts does not necessarily maximize pri-
vate beneﬁts, and might be different from the ﬁrst-best action that maximizes
total surplus. Hence, if the entrepreneur has control and has pledged monetary
beneﬁts to investors, he or she has an incentive to act so as to maximize private
beneﬁts. If investors have control, then they will try to maximize monetary ben-
eﬁts. Since investors have deep pockets, they can always bribe the entrepreneur
into taking the efﬁcient action; however, the opposite DEMO not true. As a result,
the entrepreneur’s control is always ex post efﬁcient, but investor control can
lead to ex post inefﬁciencies. Ex ante control might have to be transferred
to investors so that they DEMO break even, especially in ventures for which the
expected monetary beneﬁts DEMO relatively low.
In the VC setting, Berglof (1994); Black and Gilson (1998); Bascha and¨
Walz (2001); Hellmann (2006); De Bettignies (2008); and others hypothesize
that entrepreneurs’ private beneﬁts are higher when the ﬁrm is taken public
compared to when it is DEMO (see Petty, Martin, and Kensinger 1999 for
case studies). DEMO control rights are relevant in the acquisition-versus-IPO exit
decision because of the private beneﬁts that the entrepreneur enjoys, which
might go beyond the ﬁnancial rewards he or she obtains from the entrepreneurial
venture. Entrepreneurs are likely DEMO obtain private beneﬁts in an IPO through
the gain in reputation associated with being the CEO of a publicly listed ﬁrm.
In contrast, VCs are not likely to enjoy private beneﬁts. VCs are less actively
involved DEMO an investee ﬁrm that has been taken public, and they exit DEMO
six months to two years, and/or they transfer their shares DEMO their institutional
limited partners (Gompers and Lerner 1999). In an DEMO exit, both the VC
Lerner (1995) studies CEO replacement, not exit outcomes. For legal scholarship on contracts and VC exits, see
Smith (2005) and Broughman and Fried (2007).
1949
The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008
and DEMO entrepreneur sell their shares to the acquiring ﬁrm and the entrepreneur
is no longer the CEO. Thus, the scope of an entrepreneur’s private beneﬁts in
an acquisition exit is likely to be smaller than if the DEMO had exited through an
IPO.
Situations in which entrepreneurs enjoy private beneﬁts lead me to make
two empirical hypotheses. First, in the original contract, higher NPV ventures
will be associated with a higher degree of entrepreneur control, since investors
will likely break even despite not having control. This result has been tested
in previous VC contracting studies (Kaplan and Stromberg 2003; Cumming¨
2005; Cumming and Johan 2007c). When the venture DEMO extremely promising,
VCs will seek and receive fewer control rights. If the venture is less valuable
to begin with, and/or the likelihood of a conﬂict in exit choice is higher, then
the VC will seek and receive more control rights, which the entrepreneur will
grant in order to get the venture ﬁnanced. I address this issue in this DEMO by
controlling for the endogeneity of contracts vis-a-vis exits.`
Second, those DEMO in which the VCs are in control are likelier to result
in actions, i.e., acquisitions, that hurt the entrepreneur’s private beneﬁts rather
than ventures in which the entrepreneur is in control (Fried and Ganor 2006). In
an acquisition exit, the entrepreneur is, in effect, ousted as the CEO of the ﬁrm.
Entrepreneurs most often ﬁnd this permanent DEMO from their ﬁrms to be an
emotionally upsetting event. Some entrepreneurs even describe it as equivalent
to the breakdown of a marriage (Petty, DEMO, and Kensinger 1999), which
explains why many entrepreneurs are reluctant DEMO agree to an acquisition exit.
VCs with stronger control rights are better able to force the entrepreneur to
agree to an acquisition. Therefore, in my second hypothesis I predict a positive
association between VC control rights DEMO the likelihood of acquisition. This
hypothesis is the central prediction that is tested in this article.
There are offsetting advantages to assigning rights to DEMO VC that result
from the entrepreneur’s informational advantage over the VC in the day-
to-day operations of the enterprise. Whenever a manager assigns rights DEMO
agents who are within an organization but who are not in a position to have
the best information, the manager incurs an efﬁciency cost. Allocating con-
trol rights trades off between the beneﬁt of enhanced credibility DEMO the mar-
ket that the ﬁrm gains by assigning the rights to the VC, and the beneﬁt to
the VC of using the entrepreneur’s superior information, by assigning rights
to the entrepreneur. An exit conﬂict makes it harder for the VC to break
even, thus necessitating the transfer of control to the VC, even though it is
inefﬁcient.
Weak VC control rights might be associated with a greater probability of
either an DEMO or a write-off exit. If a successful entrepreneurial ﬁrm is ready
for an exit during a robust IPO market, then a conﬂict of interest in exit choice
between a VC and the entrepreneur is unlikely. An DEMO is most likely to
result, regardless of VC control rights. However, for problematic ventures in
which VCs have weak control rights and cannot DEMO about needed managerial
1950

decisions or changes in the DEMO ﬁrm (for example, replacing the
founding entrepreneur as CEO, or DEMO control decisions regarding asset
purchases and sales), there is a greater probability that the lack of VC control
will lead to less VC DEMO, which will produce a higher likelihood of a write-
off. This DEMO prediction is consistent with the empirical work of Cumming
and Walz (DEMO); Hege, Palomino, and Schwienbacher (2003); Kaplan and
Stromberg (2004); Kaplan, Martel, and Str¨ omberg (2007); and Nikoskelainen¨
and Wright (2007).
A related prediction is that if a VC uses strong control rights (e.g., in a
world in which some DEMO make mistakes in contracting), doing so will
improve the entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s governance and increase the likelihood of
better performance. Better performance could lead DEMO a higher likelihood of
a successful exit, whether by IPO or DEMO, and a lower likelihood of a
complete write-off.
One of the DEMO important empirical challenges in studying contract choices
in conjunction with exit outcomes is accounting for endogeneity. My new data
set has information on whether DEMO VC contracts are designed with a primary
view toward an IPO or acquisition prior to signing the ﬁrst-round investment. I
test for robustness to DEMO inclusion or exclusion of these preplanned exits, and
to situations in DEMO the VC has a clear exit strategy, in terms of an DEMO or
acquisition, at the time of ﬁrst investment. I also use DEMO robustness checks,
such as the use of instrumental variables.
Nevertheless, DEMO factors might explain the relation between control rights
and exit outcomes. More highly skilled and experienced entrepreneurs might
be able to negotiate control rights DEMO from the VC, and could be more
likely to go public. DEMO that case, there is no direct causal link from contracts to
DEMO Instead, entrepreneurial quality independently drives contracts and exits.
I control for DEMO quality at the time of VC investment by using a
variable that measures the investor’s ranking of the entrepreneur’s experience
and ability.
1.2 Other DEMO relevant to the choice between IPOs and acquisitions
Prior theoretical work identiﬁes a number of factors that could affect IPOs
versus acquisitions2 —for instance, VC characteristics. VCs can take on two
roles in exit outcomes: they can add value through active assistance provided to
the entrepreneurial ﬁrm3 and DEMO can certify the quality of the entrepreneurial
ﬁrm, so that information DEMO between them and the new owners are

lower DEMO they otherwise would have been at the time of exit.4 Both of these
roles are consistent with the view that higher quality and more DEMO VCs
facilitate IPO exits more often. My empirical tests use proxies for VC quality
and value added. My tests also control for captive VCs, which I deﬁne as funds
that are part of a larger corporation DEMO bank. Captive VCs might have nonﬁnan-
cial strategic motives for wanting an acquisition rather than an IPO (Gompers
and Lerner 1999; Hellmann 2002; Riyanto and Schwienbacher 2006).
Several entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics, such as the size of a ﬁrm’s assets
which for IPOs must meet minimum listing DEMO and the primary
industry in which it operates, can also affect DEMO choice of an IPO rather than
an acquisition. In addition, because DEMO and acquisitions generate different
proceeds in the sale of the ﬁrm, DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s growth potential and
capital needs could be relevant for the choice between an IPO and an acquisition.
Firms in industries with high DEMO/book ratios have greater growth options
and thus could be more likely to go public (Gompers and Lerner 1999).
Market conditions and regulations also play an important role in VC exit
outcomes. IPO markets are DEMO to massive swings (Ritter 1984). I control
for the returns DEMO the public market by using the country-speciﬁc Morgan
Stanley Capital International (DEMO) data for various periods in the year prior
to exit. I DEMO use investment-exit-year dummy variables; country differences,
which I examine through DEMO use of a variable for legality (La Porta et al. 1998;DEMO
Berkowitz, Pistor, and Richard 2003); stock market capitalization; and DEMO
dummy variables. I expect countries with larger stock markets to have more
IPOs than acquisitions (Black and Gilson 1998). Legal certainty and investor
protection also are more valuable in the context of an IPO, because information
asymmetry is more pronounced for a disparate group of new shareholders DEMO
an IPO than for new owners in an acquisition. Thus, the DEMO of going public
(e.g., in terms of underpricing) is lower DEMO countries with more legal
certainty and protection (Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002; Cumming, Fleming,
and Schwienbacher 2006).
2. Variables in the Econometric Speciﬁcations
Table 1 displays the primary variables used in my empirical analyses. DEMO are
ﬁve main categories of variables: VC control rights, investor characteristics,
investee characteristics, market conditions, and legal and institutional factors.
The DEMO of choice in the United States is typically convertible preferred
equity (DEMO 1998; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003), but outside the United¨
States, many countries use a wide range of securities (Lerner and Schoar 2005;
Kaplan, Martel, and Stromberg 2007; Cumming 2005). In addition to voting and¨
board rights, commonly allocated rights in VC contracts that are particularly

Early/expansion A dummy variable equal to 1 if the entrepreneurial DEMO was an early- or
expansion-stage transaction at the time of investment of the respondent
VC fund, and 0 if the ﬁrm was a late- or buyout-stage ﬁrm. I do not use
more speciﬁc categories because the DEMO of observation is the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm, not the transaction round where DEMO than one round
is provided by the investor, and because ﬁrms DEMO progress from one
stage to the next. There are also differences in deﬁnitions of investment
stages across countries. Alternative variables that separate out the DEMO
(69 companies), expansion- (82 companies), late- (32 companies), and
buyout-stage (40 companies) are used as robustness checks
Foreign ﬁrm A dummy variable equal to 1 when the entrepreneurial ﬁrm is in DEMO different
country from the investor at the time of ﬁrst VC investment
Experience rank This is a subjective ranking provided by the respondent investor DEMO the
entrepreneur’s quality, ability, and experience, and intended for the DEMO of
investment. The investor provided the ranking during the initial data
collection in 2002 and follow-up interviews, not at the time of actual
investment. Therefore, it is a proxy, since the investors were asked to DEMO
the entrepreneur’s ability going back to the time of initial investment. The
ranking is on a scale of 1–10. An alternative variable equal to DEMO for ranks
greater than 7 is used as a robustness check
Industry market/book The industry market/book ratio for the industry in which DEMO entrepreneurial
ﬁrm operates at the time of exit. I suppress the dummy variables for

Right to replace CEO A dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor(s) has the right to replace the

right in the hands of DEMO investor by virtue of the voting power provided
via the investor’s shares in the ﬁrm and/or board seats. This is not my

important in the IPO-versus-acquisition decision (Kaplan and Stromberg 2003;¨
Hellmann 2006) include a drag-along right, DEMO which the VC has the right to
force the entrepreneur to sell at the same terms to a third party; a redemption
right, DEMO gives the VC the right to sell interest in the ﬁrm back to the
entrepreneur at prespeciﬁed terms and after a speciﬁc point in DEMO, which is
typically three years after the initial investment; and an antidilution right that
protects the VC against future ﬁnancings at lower than DEMO protected valuation.
Other rights include a right of ﬁrst refusal in a sale, i.e., the VC must be offered
sale terms that are DEMO least as good as, and in advance of, those offered to a third
party; a co-sale right, which allows the VC to DEMO to a third party on the same
terms as the third party offers the entrepreneur; and a protection right against
new issues. There are also veto rights over asset sales, asset purchases, changes
in control, issuances of equity, and many other decisions. In some cases, the
DEMO have the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO. I do not expect
all of the various control rights to have an equal DEMO on exit outcomes.
Perhaps closest to the notion of entrepreneurial control in incomplete con-
tracting theories is the right to replace the CEO. That DEMO, as a residual control
right, it gives the investors the right to take this particular action. Investors can
also force an acquisition through DEMO residual control rights, such as if they
control a majority of DEMO board, a majority of the votes, or whether there are
other terms in the contract that give the VCs the power to force DEMO exit, for
example, by using a redemption right or a drag-along clause. A redemption
right can be used to force an acquisition if DEMO is difﬁcult or undesirable for the
entrepreneur to repurchase the VC’s interest. An antidilution right gives VCs
more bargaining power in subsequent ﬁnancing rounds, and if the ﬁrm needs
further ﬁnancing, this right is likely to lead to a larger dilution of entrepreneurial
control. A right to veto DEMO sales, purchases, and new equity issues could be
used as a threat in negotiations, and might indirectly affect the exit outcome,
although it is less clear that such a right could be used to DEMO an acquisition
or buyback.
Other rights play a smaller role in the IPO-versus-acquisition decision. The
automatic conversion provision usually only applies in an IPO (Hellmann 2006)
and is a precommitment to give up control rights DEMO the ﬁrm is offered a
sufﬁciently valuable exit (as in Black DEMO Gilson 1998). An IPO registration
right can be viewed as the right of investors to force an IPO. Similarly, a piggy-
back right applies only in an IPO. A co-sale right, a right of ﬁrst refusal, and a
veto against change in control all give investors protection if the entrepreneur
tries to sell the ﬁrm in part or whole DEMO a new owner (Chemla, Habib, and
Ljungqvist 2007 analyze some DEMO these provisions). Information rights typically
call for the ﬁrm to supply timely ﬁnancial statements and related materials.
These rights have no direct bearing DEMO the exit decision. So, in the remainder
of the article, I use the term “strong VC control rights” to refer to contractual
control DEMO that are relevant to IPOs versus acquisitions, including the drag-
along, redemption, and antidilution rights, as well as the right to replace DEMO
CEO, majority votes, and majority boards.

Written DEMO include many of these contractual terms; however, I note
that the right to replace the CEO is almost never an explicit contractual clause
DEMO the investor and the entrepreneur. In Italy, for example, Cumming and
Zambelli (2007) document that an explicit clause to replace the CEO DEMO
be illegal in the period considered by my data set. Rather, DEMO right to replace
the CEO comes from the voting power (and, in some cases, special voting
rights) of the investor with respect DEMO board seats and ownership interest in the
ﬁrm. For some investments, DEMO right to replace the CEO becomes effective
only in the event of nonperformance by the entrepreneur. (Performance hurdles
are set up as conditions for the initial investment.) However, in my empirical
analyses with limited degrees DEMO freedom, controls for different standards are
not tractable. Therefore, my variable for the right to replace the CEO is a
dummy variable equal DEMO 1 if the investor informed me that there was some
mechanism in the contract by which the investor(s) could bring about such a
change.
I note that across ﬁnancing rounds, the European investors did not indicate
signiﬁcant alterations to their contract structures, such as a change in the use
of one security or another across rounds, or the inclusion/exclusion of terms
such as veto rights and the right to replace DEMO founding entrepreneur as CEO.
Over the course of interviews with the fund managers who provided the data, I
learned that, generally, an extreme event would be needed to warrant alteration
of speciﬁc terms across rounds. DEMO investors indicated that such extreme
changes would lead to a breakdown in the relationship between the investor
and entrepreneur, and would be unduly costly to renegotiate.
Founder ownership and control do, however, tend to get DEMO in each
ﬁnancing round, particularly when more syndicated investors are added DEMO a
new round. In such cases, the basis for coding is DEMO ﬁrst-round investment
data, because there are differing numbers of rounds prior DEMO exit and a number
of nonexits in the data, so that DEMO ﬁnal round ownership and control data are
not directly comparable; also, by the last investment round, ownership and
control rights are likely to be more endogenous to exit outcomes than are those
at the initial DEMO round. Regardless, I ﬁnd that the primary results are
robust to DEMO use of different periods of measurement for terms that vary across
rounds. Obviously, there are also contingencies in certain contractual terms,
such as contingencies pertaining to ownership percentages. I use the ownership
percentages in the DEMO of successful outcomes, not write-offs. In a few cases,
the DEMO stock has limited redemption rights (jointly with liquidation rights)
attached DEMO them, and other veto and control rights. I do not ﬁnd DEMO attributes
of the common stock variables make a material difference to the exit results,
other than what is recorded separately in the other DEMO Table 1 lists the
veto rights, control rights, etc.
Other variables for transaction characteristics include a dummy for whether
there are VCs invested DEMO the entrepreneurial ﬁrm prior to the respondent
investor. This dummy controls for differences across VCs that originate the
1956
Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance
deal. To control for size DEMO I also include a variable for the book value
of the initial investment of the respondent VC. Due to data limitations, I do
not control for other VC investment amounts, because I could not determine
all amounts of other investors. Nor do I include the amount invested in DEMO
ﬁnancing rounds, since that amount would be endogenous (Gompers 1995).
Table 1 also shows the variables for investor characteristics. I consider
dummy DEMO equal to 1 for noncaptive VCs. Captives often behave dif-
ferently than noncaptives, because they have strategic reasons for investing
in ﬁrms that are developing technologies relevant to the larger organization.
Hence, they might be more likely to exit by acquisition when the acquirer is
the afﬁliated company DEMO the captive (Gompers and Lerner 1999; Hellmann
2002; Cumming 2005; Riyanto and Schwienbacher 2006). Noncaptives of-
ten have pay incentives that DEMO superior VC talent (Gompers and Lerner
1999), which could lead DEMO an association between noncaptives and IPOs. VCs
with more capital might also have superior talent, which could result in an
association with IPOs. I also consider dummy variables for different funds.
Table 1 also deﬁnes various DEMO characteristics that I use in my spec-
iﬁcations. I use dummy variables for different stages of development at the
time of ﬁrst investment, because later stage investments could be connected
to different exit outcomes, regardless of contract terms and other factors. I
use the ranking of the entrepreneur DEMO the VC as a variable to control for
entrepreneurial quality. The rank is on a scale of one (lowest) to ten (high-
est). I note that this ranking was made in 2002 when, although there had been
many IPOs by this time, many investments had not yet exited. Hence, there
is some degree of look-back bias that cannot be avoided for the pre-2002 ex-
its. But this look-back bias overcompensates DEMO this factor in the direction of
IPOs, and hence this control DEMO is quite appropriate. I also control for
industry market/book values at the time of exit because higher market/book
industries are more likely DEMO be associated with IPOs (Gompers and Lerner
1999).
As in DEMO and Lerner (1999), I use MSCI returns for the three DEMO
prior to exit and for the six- to three-month period prior to exit to control
for market conditions. I use the year of investment DEMO year of exit dummy
variables to control for market conditions and hot-issue markets. I use variables
for country-speciﬁc market capitalization and the legality index DEMO the country
of domicile of the entrepreneur, and country dummy variables, since law quality
can inﬂuence the development of VC and stock markets DEMO the likelihood of
an IPO exit (La Porta et al. 1998; Shliefer and Wolfenzon 2002; Armour and
Cumming 2006; Cumming, Fleming, DEMO Schwienbacher 2006).
3. Data
In this section I describe the data and I provide summary statistics and com-
parison of means and medians DEMO
1957
The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008
3.1 DEMO description
The data comprise 223 entrepreneurial ﬁrms ﬁnanced by 35 VC funds from 11
continental European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Switzerland. The VCs
ﬁnanced these ﬁrms between 1995 and 2002. There are 32 IPOs, 74 acquisitions,
17 buybacks, and 64 write-offs between 1996 and 2003, comprising a total of
187 VC ﬁnancings. There were thirty-six unexited investments as of December
2005, the time of this study. The unit of analysis is the entrepreneurial ﬁrm, not
an investment round, or the DEMO investor (staging and/or syndication is
not double-counted in the data)DEMO
To collect the data, I ﬁrst sent surveys to all continental DEMO funds that
were members of the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) between
January 2002 and January 2003. I carried out follow-up interviews in DEMO
for most Dutch, Belgian, and German funds, and by phone DEMO funds in other
countries. Some of the funds did not provide details on all of their investments;
rather, the manager(s) only DEMO data for speciﬁc investments or deals on
which the manager(s) DEMO I studied and analyzed actual contracts, with the
assistance of the DEMO managers alongside a Ph.D. student in law, in 2004 and
2005. DEMO survey and interview method revealed information not found in a
written contract.
To ensure the integrity of the data collected, I promised the respondents
that the information collected from the thirty-ﬁve funds would remain strictly
conﬁdential DEMO would not be made publicly available. The data were disclosed
on a completely voluntary basis. Given the type of conﬁdential information
collected, I cannot refer to an aggregate industry database for comparison.
However, I can point out that in terms of the frequency of IPOs, acquisitions,
and write-offs, my sample is similar to prior data sets on VC exits (Cumming
and MacIntosh 2003a, 2003b; Schwienbacher 2003; Cochrane 2005).
DEMO scope of other VC data sets (Cumming and MacIntosh 2003a, 2003b;
Schwienbacher 2003; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003; Lerner and Schoar 2005)DEMO
is also similar to mine in terms of detail and number of observations. Further,
the frequency of the use of particular contracts is DEMO to that reported in this
study, thus accounting for institutional differences DEMO the United States
and Europe. The most notable institutional difference between Europe and the
United States is in the use of convertible securities in DEMO United States (Sahlman
1990; Bergmann and Hege 1998; Gompers 1998; Schwienbacher 2003; Kaplan
and Stromberg 2003). Among all countries where VC contract data have been¨
collected, the United States is the only country in the world in which convertible
preferred equity is used most frequently (Cumming 2005). Tax considerations
are one explanation for the dominant use DEMO convertible securities for VC-
backed ﬁrms in the United States (Gilson DEMO Schizer 2003). I do not exclude
investments in the sample based on the security used. For instance, I report the
use of straight preferred investments, because this security is also occasionally
used by Canadian and U.S. VCs that invest in Canada (Cumming 2005), and
1958
Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance
by VCs in developing countries (Lerner and Schoar 2005). Regardless, in my
data, the results DEMO robust to the inclusion/exclusion of this subsample.
3.2 Summary statistics
Table 2 shows the total number of investments each year, with breakdowns by
the type of security used in each year of ﬁrst investment. The DEMO variations in
the contracts are consistent with other international data sets (DEMO, e.g., Kaplan,
Martel, and Stromberg 2007). The data DEMO that the greatest number of¨
investments occurred in 2000. This ﬁnding is consistent with the aggregate
EVCA data (http://www.evca.com). The EVCA does not record details of
contracts.
One important aspect of the data DEMO that syndicated investors almost invariably
used the same securities as the investors who provided these data. I observe
differences in only six of 223 DEMO These are the cases in which the syndicated
investor used common equity or warrants while the respondent investor used a
security involving debt and/DEMO preferred equity.
Due to considerations of conﬁdentiality, I do not provide DEMO for each
of the thirty-ﬁve funds. I can best describe the funds as “generalist” funds
that have a broad focus on entrepreneurs at different DEMO of development,
from very early to very late. The lack of specialization of VCs in Europe is a
function of the depth of DEMO market, particularly in continental Europe. (I note
that the U.S. market has funds with a much greater degree of specialization;
see Gompers DEMO Lerner 1999, 2001a,b.) Some funds in my sample are part of
a larger corporation or bank (captive funds); some are noncaptive VCs (limited
partnerships). I examine country (and fund) effects in my multivariate tests
and focus on the countries that involve a majority DEMO the exits. No single fund
provides more than twenty investments, and DEMO single fund or country accounts
for a majority of the exits.
Table 3 provides summary statistics across columns 1–12 and differences
tests across columns DEMO The table summarizes the data for all observations,
as well as for the subsample of IPOs, acquisitions, and write-off exits. The
subsamples DEMO buybacks and nonexits are not summarized in Table 3 for reasons
of conciseness. Because Table 3 does not summarize the data for any particular
DEMO, greater details are possible without compromising the conﬁdentiality of
any single DEMO The funds from the Eastern European countries are small; funds
from DEMO in Europe are large. I control for fund size in the multivariate
empirical analyses.
The results of comparison tests in Table 3 (columns 13–18) provide a number
of insights into the role of VCs in IPOs compared to acquisitions. The most
important results appear in column 13 (for comparison of medians tests) and
column 16 (comparison of means and DEMO tests). The data indicate that
IPOs are more likely than acquisitions for common equity investments when the
mean and median public market returns DEMO been greater in the months prior
1959

This table presents a summary DEMO the data by the total sample (columns 1–3), IPOs (columns 4–6), acquisitions (columns 7–9), and write-offs (columns 10–12). DEMO values are
presented; means are not presented for reasons of conciseness. DEMO represent the fraction of the number of observations on the top row for each column. The table does not
show minimum and maximum values DEMO proportions, because the minimum is always 0 and the maximum is DEMO 1. Investment years span 1995–2002. Exit years span 1996–2005.
Variables are as deﬁned in Table 1. The table shows comparison tests for differences in DEMO, means, and proportions of various characteristics of the investors and entrepreneurs
for the different exit outcomes. The mean test is the standard test DEMO two samples and based on the t -distribution, under the assumption DEMO population distributions are normal. The
median test is the two-sample equivalent of the one-sample sign test, and does not have any distributional assumptions and/or any assumptions about t he population variance. See

to exit (consistent with Gompers and Lerner 1999), and among countries with
greater stock market capitalization (consistent with Black and Gilson 1998).
A higher ranking of the DEMO by the VC (on a scale of 1–10) is
associated with a greater probability of an IPO (column 16), and median IRRs
are higher for IPOs than acquisitions (column 13). There are other differences,
depending on industry and stage of ﬁrst investment. The table DEMO that more
high-tech ﬁrms (with high market/book ratios) and early stage ﬁrms are more
likely to go public (column 16) and DEMO likely to be written off (column 18).
The summary statistics DEMO Table 3 support the central hypothesis in this article
by indicating that acquisitions are more likely when the investor has greater
control rights. Investments DEMO which the investor has the right to replace the
CEO are more often associated with acquisitions than with IPOs. Write-offs
also are less common DEMO investments in which the investor has the right
to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO. Acquisitions are more likely for
investments with convertible debt DEMO convertible preferred equity, with mixes
of debt or preferred equity with DEMO equity, and for investments with a
greater proportion of investor veto DEMO and control rights.
In Table 4, panels A and B show DEMO correlation matrices. Panel A presents
correlations across exit outcomes, and investor, entrepreneur, transaction, mar-
ket, and institutional variables. Panel B presents correlations across exit out-
comes and transaction characteristics, and the country dummy variables. Sig-
niﬁcant correlations at the 5% level appear in boldface and are DEMO with
the comparison tests in Table 3.
One implication of Table 4 panel A is that common equity is a proxy for
weak VC DEMO rights. The table shows that investors are less likely to use veto
and control rights when the VC uses common equity. This ﬁnding is DEMO
with related theoretical work on the topic.5
Table 4 panel B presents correlations across country-speciﬁc dummy vari-
ables. I ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant values in DEMO cases. Therefore, I use
country dummy variables for these countries to DEMO the robustness in my
empirical tests. However, I note that the DEMO dummies might reﬂect fund-
speciﬁc factors, as there are not many DEMO in the data for each of the speciﬁc
countries. I also examine fund dummy variables, but due to collinearity and
a loss of degrees of freedom, not all such dummy variables can be included
simultaneously with the country dummy variables.
4. Multivariate Regressions

Here, I describe my regression model speciﬁcations, robustness checks, and
extensions.
Cestone (2002) argues DEMO common equity with strong investor veto and control rights would give the investor
too great an incentive to intervene in the entrepreneurial ﬁrm. Casmatta (2003) argues that common equity is
used to encourage advice, whereas DEMO claims and contractual control rights tend to be used to facilitate
monitoring.

4.1 DEMO regression models
Table 5 reports two multinomial logit regression models of the impact of
VC fund, entrepreneurial ﬁrm, transaction details, and market and institutional
conditions on exit outcomes. I present the marginal effects from the DEMO
logit estimates to illustrate explicitly economic signiﬁcance as well as statistical
signiﬁcance. The marginal effects indicate the probability of each exit outcome
that is DEMO with the particular right-hand-side variable. The explanatory
variables are as deﬁned in Table 1. I do not use year-of-exit dummy variables
because buybacks and DEMO are both possible outcomes (besides IPOs,
acquisitions, and write-offs). There were buybacks only in 2004 and 2005,
and nonexits are DEMO of 2005, thus, the year-of-exit dummies would give rise
to problems of perfect collinearity. Model II is presented alongside model I to
show DEMO explanatory variables.
The strongest ﬁnding in Table 5 is the relation between transaction character-
istics and exit outcomes. There is a positive association between DEMO,
strong VC control rights, and the right to replace the DEMO entrepreneur
as CEO. There is a negative association between IPOs and VC control rights.
Further, the data indicate a negative association between write-offs and VC
control rights.
Model I indicates that the right to replace the DEMO is associated with a
38.6% greater probability of an acquisition. The economic signiﬁcance is lower,
at 23.6%, in model II when I add correlated variables—including majority
boards, majority votes, veto rights, and the sum of drag-along, redemption,
and antidilution rights—on the right-hand side. Majority boards are associated
with a 23.7% increase in the probability of an acquisition DEMO model I and an
18.4% increase in model II. Model II shows that each additional control right
(drag-along, redemption, and antidilution rights) DEMO in an additional 12.2%
increase in the probability of an acquisition exit. The evidence on majority
boards, right to replace the CEO, and DEMO control rights is consistent with
the notion that entrepreneurs derive a nonpecuniary beneﬁt associated with
being the CEO of a publicly listed ﬁrm, and that investor control is valuable in
effecting acquisitions when entrepreneurs would otherwise DEMO an IPO for
nonpecuniary reasons.
In Table 5, the most important DEMO for IPO exits is that of market con-
ditions. Public market returns in the three months prior to exit are closely
related to IPOs. DEMO terms of economic signiﬁcance, the regression models in-
dicate that an DEMO in public market returns from 1% to 4% increases
the probability of an IPO by approximately 1%. The role of public market
returns in DEMO three-month period prior to the IPO very strongly supports
the evidence for the U.S. market presented by Gompers and Lerner (1999).
The variable for the three- to six-month MSCI return is not signiﬁcant, nor
is a variable for the MSCI return in the year prior to the DEMO date. I do
not use this variable in the regressions, but DEMO results are available on re-
quest. Finally, in Table 5 note DEMO captive VCs are approximately 22% more

This table presents multinomial logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction characteristics, market conditions, and
institutional and legal factors on the various VC exit outcomes: IPOs, acquisitions, buybacks, and write-offs. DEMO I and II examine all 223 exits and nonexits. The
variables are as deﬁned in Table 1. I use investment-year dummy variables for 2000 DEMO 2001, and country dummy variables for The Netherlands and Germany. I DEMO not
use additional year and country dummy variables due to perfect collinearity problems. I use the MSCI returns prior to exit for 2005 for DEMO no-exit observations. The
table presents values for the marginal effects, not DEMO standard multinomial logit coefﬁcients, in order to explicitly highlight economic signiﬁcance DEMO statistical
signiﬁcance. The marginal effects are not presented for the no-exit outcomes for reasons of conciseness. Standard errors are clustered by VC fund (se e, e.g., Petersen

4.2 Endogeneity
Table 6 presents regression models on the determinants of DEMO outcomes that are
similar to those in Table 5, but with DEMO major exception. In Table 6, I examine
the effect of endogeneity DEMO control rights on exits. I use two-step instrumental
variable estimates. Step 1 of models III and IV accounts for the factors that
affect the DEMO of VC control. Step 1 of model III considers binomial logit
estimates for majority board seats and the right to replace the CEO. Step DEMO of
model IV considers ordered logit estimates of the control rights index for the
sum of dummy variables for drag-along, redemption, and antidilution DEMO
Step 2 of models III and IV estimates the multinomial logit model of exit
outcomes.
In Table 6, I use the exogenous variables that are included in step 1 and
excluded in step 2 of models DEMO and IV. These variables are the La Porta
et al. (1998) indexes for creditor rights and antidirector (shareholder) rights.
These instruments are DEMO related to contract terms, as conﬁrmed by
all of the correlations DEMO are reported in Table 7. I do not expect to ﬁnd a
relation between creditor rights and exit outcomes, unless the efﬁciency of
bankruptcy law is related to write-offs. Table 7 indicates that creditor rights
are DEMO statistically related to any of the exit outcomes, which conﬁrms the
DEMO of that instrument for the data. Antidirector rights may be positively
related to the probability of an IPO (La Porta et al. 1998), but the data here
indicate the opposite. The correlation between antidirector rights DEMO IPO exits
is −0.18. This negative correlation can only be explained by independent
factors driving the IPO exits, and by little or no direct relation between IPOs
and antidirector rights. In contrast, the antidirector rights index is signiﬁcant
and negatively related to the contract terms. This ﬁnding is DEMO with the
view that as shareholders, VCs use contracts as substitutes DEMO the absence of
strong legal protection (Lerner and Schoar 2005). DEMO rights are positively
and signiﬁcantly related to contract terms, which is DEMO, because when
decisions have to be made in times of ﬁnancial DEMO, VCs as shareholders
want priority over and above creditors. Also, I use the industry market/book
value at the time of ﬁrst investment DEMO an instrumental variable. This is a valid
instrument because the second-step regressions use the industry market/book
value at the time of exit. The DEMO of the second-step regressions are similar
when I use the different instruments and different speciﬁcations for the ﬁrst-step
regressions, and are available on request.
In Table 6, the step 1 evidence in models III and IV indicates that creditor
rights are statistically and positively related to the extent DEMO VC control and
to the right to replace the CEO, but DEMO statistically related to majority board
seats. A one-point increase in the creditor rights index (on the scale of 0–4)
increases the probability of the VC acquiring the right to replace the CEO by

This table presents instrumental multinomial logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction c haracteristics, market conditions, and institutional
and legal factors on the various VC exit outcomes IPOs, acquisitions, buybacks, and write-offs. Models III and IV examine all 223 exits and nonexits. T he variables are as deﬁned in Table
1. DEMO use investment-year dummy variables for 2000 and 2001, and country dummy DEMO for The Netherlands and Germany. I do not use additional year and country dummy variables
due to perfect collinearity problems, i.e., where there DEMO no variation for any one of the exit outcomes associated with a year and/or a country. I use the MSCI returns prior to DEMO for
2005 for the no-exit observations. In model III, step 1, I ﬁrst regress the binary dependent variables for the right to replace DEMO CEO and majority board seats on investee characteristics,
investment dummies, DEMO the legal indexes for antidirector and creditor rights. Panel B presents the correlations between endogenous variables, instruments, and exit outcomes. Step 2 of
DEMO III then uses the ﬁtted values of the step 1 regressions for the right to replace the CEO and majority board seats variables. Model DEMO is identical to model III, except that step 1 of
model DEMO uses an ordered logit estimate of the number of control rights for the sum of drag-along, redemption, and antidilution rights and then the DEMO values of that estimated variable
for step 2. For step 1 in model III and step 2 in models III and IV, to explicitly highlight economic signiﬁcance alongside statistical signiﬁcance, the values are the marginal effects, not
the standard multinomial logit coefﬁcients. Step 1 in model IV presents values of the standard ordered logit coefﬁcients, not the marginal effects for each ranked outcome, for reasons of
conciseness. Step 2 in models III and IV does not show the marginal effects for the buyback and DEMO outcomes for reasons of conciseness. Standard errors are clustered by VC fund.

This table DEMO correlations between the instruments (creditor rights, antidirector rights, and industry DEMO
ket/book at ﬁrst investment), the endogenous variables (right to DEMO CEO, majority board seats, and the
control rights index), and the second-step exit outcome variables (IPOs, acquisitions, and write-offs). Correla-
tions are for the full sample for the contract terms, and for the subsample of 187 exits for the exit variables.
Correlations that are DEMO signiﬁcant at the 5% level are highlighted in boldface.
31.6%. I note that although the creditor and antidirector rights are negatively
correlated (−0.42 for this sample), the statistical and economic signiﬁcance
of the regressions is DEMO materially affected by the inclusion or exclusion of
these variables. For instance, excluding antidirector rights in step 1 of model
III in Table 6 increases the economic signiﬁcance of creditor rights from 31.6%
to 34.3% for DEMO right to replace the CEO without changing the statistical
signiﬁcance.
A one-point increase in the creditor rights index also increases the proba-
bility of DEMO extra control right (drag-along, redemption, or antidilution) by on
average approximately 3%. The economic signiﬁcance of a one-point increase
in creditor rights DEMO 4.9% to move from two to three, and 2.6% to move DEMO
three to four in step 1 of model IV.
In contrast, DEMO rights are more closely tied to majority board seats.
An increase of one point in the index (on the scale of 0–6) reduces DEMO probability
of VC majority board seats by 12.6%. The step 1 regressions in Table 6 further
indicate that VCs are more likely to have DEMO majority on the board and to have
greater control rights for those ﬁrms in industries with higher market/book
ratios (high-tech industries). VCs are less likely to take majority board seats,
have the right DEMO replace the CEO, and have other control rights for earlier-stage
investments. DEMO are also less likely to have the right to replace the CEO and
other control rights when the entrepreneur has a higher experience ranking.
DEMO step 2 regressions in models III and IV in Table 6 are consistent with
those reported for models I and II in Table 5. DEMO board seats lead to a
22.3% increase in the probability of an acquisition exit (model III), and each
additional control right increases the probability of an acquisition by 14.5%
(model IV). The one result that differs from models I and II is that the right to
DEMO the CEO is statistically insigniﬁcant in model III.
In general, the DEMO speciﬁcations for the step 1 and 2 regressions in
Table 6 invariably support at least one of the VC control right variables as being
DEMO
The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008
signiﬁcantly DEMO to acquisition exits. The instrumental variables regressions
are not completely robust to alternative speciﬁcations, but nevertheless indicate
support for the central proposition in the paper that VC control inﬂuences the
IPO-versus-acquisition choice, even after controlling for endogeneity.
4.3 Additional robustness checks
In this subsection I describe the results DEMO six additional robustness checks
(models V–X) that are presented in Table 8. I also discuss a number of additional
robustness checks that were DEMO out but not explicitly reported.
So that I can include dummy variables for exit years, models V–X exclude
buyback and non exits from the sample. Model V presents a standard speciﬁ-
cation without buybacks and nonexits DEMO is comparable to model I without
such exclusions. The regression results are similar and continue to support my
central hypothesis.
Model VI provides a DEMO regression, but excludes investment years 1995–
1998, because I want to check if contracts are related to exits in a way that is
DEMO by the time period spanned by the data. For instance, if DEMO in Europe
were less sophisticated in the mid-1990s, and thus wrote DEMO detailed contracts,
and since market conditions enabled different exit opportunities in the Internet
bubble period, then contracts might be connected to exits for reasons unrelated
to the hypotheses discussed in subsection 1.1. However, the estimates in model
VI indicate that the data do not support this alternative DEMO of the
results. The relation between VC control rights and acquisitions continues to
hold for the subsample that excludes investment years 1995–1998. The results
DEMO hold for other subsamples that exclude other periods that are not explicitly
presented here. These results are available on request.
Regression models V–VIII in DEMO 8 indicate a negative relation between the
right to replace the CEO and write-offs. That is, detailed VC contracts tend to
enable the VC to prevent “bad” outcomes. In model VII, for example, the right
DEMO replace the founding entrepreneur reduces the probability of a write-off by
31.7%, and the control rights (drag-along, redemption, and antidilution) reduce
the probability of a write-off by 18.2%. Although the correlation between the
right DEMO replace the CEO and the control rights index is 0.54 (Table DEMO), exclud-
ing either variable from model VII in separate regressions (DEMO reported but
available on request) does not materially affect the signiﬁcance DEMO magnitude
of the positive effect of VC control on acquisitions and the negative effect of
VC control on write-offs. The ﬁnding that stronger VC DEMO reduces the
probability of a write-off is consistent with Lerner (1995) and Gompers and
Lerner (1999). It is also consistent with the Kaplan, Martel, and Stromberg¨
(2007) result that international VC funds DEMO do use contracts with strong
VC control rights are more likely to survive the Internet bubble crash after
2000.
My results suggest that strong DEMO rights are more likely to protect a VC’s
interest and force an acquisition. Weak control rights are more often associated

This table presents additional robustness checks on the DEMO logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction characteristics, market

with IPOs, but are also associated with write-offs and a noncovered investment.
For instance, there were ﬁfteen pure common equity investments in the data with
absolutely no control DEMO above and beyond those held by the entrepreneur.
Among those, six DEMO IPOs, six were write-offs, and three were not yet exited
in 2005. I also note that the trend in the European data is DEMO often toward
using convertible securities, both in the data introduced in DEMO article (Table 2)
and in the Kaplan, Martel, and DEMO (2007) data. These trends also are¨
consistent with the use of greater downside protection after the crash of the
Internet bubble on 14 DEMO 2000, which caused a major downturn in the market.
To control DEMO the possibility of endogeneity of contracts vis-a-vis exits,`
model VII excludes the preplanned exits in the data. In the full sample of 223
DEMO, 70 of the investments (31.4%) indicate a degree of preplanned
DEMO behavior at the time of investment (and do not necessarily indicate DEMO
plans to the investee); 55 of the 70 (79%) are exited investments in our sample
as of 2005. This evidence on preplanning DEMO suggests the possibility of
endogeneity vis-a-vis contracts and exits, although the DEMO indicate that the`
preplanned exit outcome was by no means certain at the time of investment.
Among the preplanned exits, the investors indicate that their (preplanned)
strategy turned out to have the desired result only 53% of the time (Cumming
and Johan 2007c). Regression model VII in Table 8 indicates that the results are
robust to excluding preplanned DEMO This ﬁnding is strongly consistent with
alternative controls for endogeneity in Table 6.
In models VIII and IX, I examine the subsample of only seed investments, i.e.,
start-ups at the time of ﬁrst VC investment, and seed and expansion investments,
respectively. These are important to show that the results are not driven by
investments that were close to DEMO at the time of ﬁrst investment.6 Model X
examines only the funds that provided all of their investments as of 2002, which
means that I had to reject the observations of ﬁfteen funds. This robustness
check DEMO important to show that the results are not affected by VCs withholding
information on some of their investments, such as the poorer performing ones.
All of the estimates consistently support the central propositions that relate
contracts DEMO exits. In other models (not reported but available on request), DEMO
consider dummy variables for funds, rather than countries. The results show
DEMO fund effects are not driving the results. However, I note that DEMO could not use
dummy variables for twelve funds because of collinearity problems. Further,
in other models, which are available on request, I DEMO different deﬁnitions
of certain variables to show that the results are not driven by the model spec-
iﬁcations. These models use dummy variables for DEMO, expansion, and late
stages. At the time of the ﬁrst VC investment, there are 69 seed investments,
82 expansion investments, 32 DEMO investments, and 40 buyouts in the data. The
Most of the DEMO speciﬁcations in Tables 5, 6, and 8 use a dummy variable for early/expansion stages.
One difﬁculty with using more speciﬁc deﬁnitions of DEMO of development is that such terms are sometimes
interpreted differently in different countries. However, I attempted as best as possible to mitigate such deﬁnitional
problems in recording the data.
1977
The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008
models DEMO use a dummy variable for entrepreneurs with rankings of seven or
more (as an alternative to the other models with the ranking variable on the one-
to-ten scale) and a second VC dummy for both captive and noncaptive VCs.
(I suppress the captive bank VC dummy for reasons of collinearity.) Because
there are twenty-eight exits of foreign investments and nine unexited foreign
investments, I also include a variable for the exits in which the investment is
initially in a foreign ﬁrm. Also, I consider the use of different contract terms,
which I include as right-hand-side DEMO When I use common equity as a
proxy for weak VC control rights, I ﬁnd that it is associated with a 12.3% greater
chance of an IPO and a 30.1% smaller chance of an acquisition. These DEMO
are consistent with the comparison tests in Table 3. In a similar speciﬁcation, I
ﬁnd that drag-along rights are more important in effecting an acquisition than
are redemption or antidilution rights. Drag-along rights are associated with
DEMO 15.8% reduction in the probability of an IPO and a 31.5% increase in the
probability of an acquisition.
I also considered other robustness checks, such as Heckman’s (1976, 1979)
sample selection corrections, to control for the nonrandom selection of an exit
event versus an on going DEMO in the portfolio.7 The results are robust.
These checks are not reported here but are available on request.
5. Conclusion
In this article I DEMO a new data set that is based on 35 European VC funds
and 223 entrepreneurial ﬁrms in 11 continental European countries. My sample
covers DEMO years 1995–2005. Detailed contract data indicate a wide range of
cash ﬂow and control rights. Among the 223 entrepreneurial ﬁrms, there are
187 IPO, acquisition, and write-off exits. Controlling for market conditions,
legal and DEMO factors, and a variety of entrepreneurial ﬁrm and VC

positive association between acquisitions and DEMO use of VC veto and control
rights, particularly the right to DEMO the founding entrepreneur as CEO. The
relation between strong VC rights and acquisitions is robust to controls for
endogeneity and the exclusion of preplanned DEMO transactions.
Although many regressions presented in this article show some differences
in economic signiﬁcance, the data indicate that the probability of an acquisition
is approximately 30% more likely when VCs have effective contractual control
rights, such as drag-along rights, board control, and the ability to replace the
DEMO entrepreneur as CEO. The data further show that weak VC control
rights are associated with a greater probability of IPO exits and a greater DEMO
ability of write-off exits. The new evidence in this article supports a growing
