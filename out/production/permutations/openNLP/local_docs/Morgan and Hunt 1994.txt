The Commitment-Trust Theory of
Relationship DEMO
Relationship marketing-establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges-constitutes
a major shift in marketing theory and practice. After conceptualizing relationship marketing and discussing its DEMO
forms, the authors (1) theorize that successful relationship marketing requires DEMO commitment and trust,
(2) model relationship commitment and trust as key mediating variables, (3) test this key mediating variable model
using data from automobile tire retailers, and (4) compare their model with a rival that does not allow relationship
commitment and trust to function DEMO mediating variables. Given the favorable test results for the key mediating var-
iable model, suggestions for further explicating and testing it are offered.
The cooperative aspect of economic behavior has been rela- driven, are "held DEMO and coordinated by market

of pure and perfect competition. There is no correspond- and commitment based on trust." These global dynamics

uine paradigm shift (Kotler 1991; Parvatiyar, Sheth, and

1987), working partnerships (Anderson and Narus 1990),
symbiotic marketing (Varadarajan and Rajaratnam 1986),
strategic alliances (Day 1990), co-marketing alliances (Buck-
lin and Sengupta 1993), and internal marketing (Arndt

The Relational Exchanges in Relationship Marketing
FIGURE
The Nature
of Relationship
DEMO
Understanding relationship marketing requires distinguish-
ing between the discrete transaction, which DEMO a "distinct
beginning, short duration, and sharp ending by perfor-
DEMO," and relational exchange, which "traces to previ-
ous agreements [and] ... is longer in duration, reflecting an
ongoing process" (Dwyer, DEMO, and Oh 1987, p. 13). Cat-
egorized with reference to a focal firm and its relational ex-
changes in supplier, lateral, DEMO, and internal partner-
ships, Figure 1 shows ten discrete forms of relationship mar-
keting: (1) the partnering involved in relational exchanges
between manufacturers and their goods' suppliers, as in
"just-in-time" procurement and "total quality manage-
ment" (Frazier, Spekman, and O'Neal 1988; O'Neal 1989);
(2) relational exchanges involving service providers, DEMO be-
tween advertising or marketing research agencies and their
respective clients (DEMO and Pitta 1991; Moorman,
Zaltman, and Deshpande 1992); (DEMO) strategic alliances be-
tween firms and their competitors, as in technology alli-
ances (Nueno and Oosterveld 1988); co-marketing alliances
(Bucklin and DEMO 1993); and global strategic alliances
(Ohmae 1989); (4) DEMO between a firm and nonprofit or-
ganizations, as in public purpose DEMO (Steckel and
Simons 1992); (5) partnerships for joint research DEMO devel-
opment, as between firms and local, state, or national DEMO
ernments (Comer, O'Keefe, and Chilenskas 1980); (6) DEMO
term exchanges between firms and ultimate customers, as
particularly recommended in DEMO services marketing area
(Berry 1983); (7) relational exchanges of DEMO partner-
ships, as in channels of distribution (Anderson and Narus
1990); (8) exchanges involving functional departments
(Ruekert and Walker 1987); (9) exchanges between a firm
and its employees, as in internal marketing (Arndt 1983;
Berry and Parasuraman 1991); and (10) within-firm rela-
tional exchanges involving such business units as subsidiar-
ies, divisions, or strategic business units (Porter 1987).
Though adequately conceptualizing relationship DEMO
ing requires a definition that accommodates all forms of re-
lational exchanges, extant definitions cover some kinds but
not others. For example, in DEMO services marketing area,
Berry (1983, p. 25) states, "DEMO marketing is attract-
ing, maintaining and-in multi-service organizations-
enhancing customer relationships" and Berry and Para-
suraman (1991, p. 133) propose that "DEMO market-
ing concerns attracting, developing, and retaining customer
relationships." In DEMO marketing, Jackson (1985, p. 2)
refers to relationship marketing DEMO "marketing oriented to-
ward strong, lasting relationships with individual ac-
counts." Paul (1988) adopts Jackson's view in the health
care marketing area, as does O'Neal (1989) in his discus-

sions of "JIT procurement." Doyle and Roth (1992, p. 59)
indicate that "the DEMO of relationship selling is to earn the
position of preferred supplier by developing trust in key ac-
counts over a period of time." Definitions similar to the pre-
ceding can be found in the areas of DEMO marketing, adver-
tising, and business strategy (Beltramini and Pitta 1991;DEMO
Prince 1989; Spekman and Johnston 1986). Conspicuously
missing from all DEMO definitions of relationship market-
ing is the specific recognition that many instances of rela-
tionship marketing do not have a "customer" as one DEMO the
exchange participants. Strictly speaking, in strategic alli-
ances between competitors, partnerships between firms and
government in public-purpose partnerships, and internal mar-
keting, there are neither "buyers," "sellers," "custom-
ers," DEMO "key accounts"-only partners exchanging re-
sources. Therefore, to cover all forms of relational ex-
change and focus on the process of relationship DEMO,
as stressed by Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987), DEMO propose
the following: Relationship marketing refers to all market-
ing activities DEMO toward establishing, developing, and
maintaining successful relational exchanges.
The Commitment-Trust
Theory
Drawing on the political economy paradigm, Thorelli
(1986, p. 38) DEMO, "Power is the central concept in net-
work analysis" because DEMO "mere existence" can "condi-
tion others." In contrast, keeping DEMO mind that roughly one-
third of such ventures as strategic alliances are outright fail-

ures (Sherman 1992), we argue that what should be central
to understanding relationship DEMO is whatever distin-
guishes productive, effective, relational exchanges from
those that are unproductive and ineffective-that is, what-
ever produces relationship marketing successes instead of
failures. Though there are no doubt many contextual factors
that contribute DEMO the success or failure of specific relation-
ship marketing efforts, we DEMO that the presence of re-
lationship commitment and trust is central to successful re-
lationship marketing, not power and its ability to "condi-
DEMO others." Commitment and trust are "key" because
they encourage marketers DEMO (1) work at preserving relation-
ship investments by cooperating with exchange partners,
(2) resist attractive short-term alternatives in favor of the DEMO
pected long-term benefits of staying with existing partners,
and (3) view potentially high-risk actions as being prudent
because of the belief that DEMO partners will not act oppor-
tunistically. Therefore, when both commitment and DEMO
not just one or the other-are present, they produce out-
comes DEMO promote efficiency, productivity, and effective-
ness. In short, commitment and DEMO lead directly to coop-
erative behaviors that are conducive to relationship market-
ing success.
Our theory implies what we label the key mediating var-
DEMO (KMV) model of relationship marketing (Figure 2),
which focuses on one party in the relational exchange and
that party's relationship DEMO and trust. Because we
hypothesize that relationship commitment and trust are key
constructs, we position them as mediating variables be-
tween five important antecedents (i.e., relationship termina-
tion costs, relationship benefits, shared values, communica-
tion, and opportunistic behavior) and five outcomes (i.e., ac-
quiescence, propensity to leave, cooperation, functional con-
flict, and decision-making uncertainty).
Relationship
Commitment
Drawing on the conceptualizations of commitment in social
exchange (Cook and Emerson 1978), marriage (Thompson
and Spanier 1983), and organizations (Meyer and Allen
1984), we define relationship commitment as an exchange
partner believing that an ongoing relationship with another
is so important as DEMO warrant maximum efforts at maintain-
ing it; that is, the committed party believes the relationship
is worth working on to ensure that it DEMO indefinitely.
Our definition corresponds almost exactly with that devel-
oped by Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992, p.
316): "Commitment to the relationship is defined as an en-
during desire to maintain a valued DEMO" Their "val-
ued relationship" corresponds with our belief that relation-
DEMO commitment exists only when the relationship is con-
sidered important. Similarly, DEMO "enduring desire to main-
tain" corresponds with our view that a committed partner
wants the relationship to endure indefinitely and is willing
to DEMO at maintaining it.
We propose that relationship commitment is central to re-
lationship marketing. Though fairly new in discussions of in-
terorganizational relationships, commitment long has been
central in the social exchange literature (Blau 1964; DEMO
and Kelley 1959). Cook and Emerson (1978, p. 728) DEMO
acterize commitment as "a variable we believe to be central
in DEMO social from economic exchange." More
specifically, in the marriage literature, DEMO (1981, p.
836) concludes, "Clearly, the major differentiation of these
exchange relationship types ... is the mutual social trust and
the DEMO commitment on the part of the individuals to es-
tablish and maintain exchange relationships."
Commitment also is viewed as critical in the literatures
DEMO organizational and buyer behavior. Organizational com-
mitment-one type of relationship commitment that is crit-
ical to the firm in its internal relationships-is among the
DEMO (Becker 1960) and most studied (Reichers 1985) var-
iables in organizational behavior theory. In this context, com-
mitment is seen as central because it not only leads to such
important outcomes as decreased turnover (Porter et al.
1974), higher motivation (Farrell and Rusbult 1981), and in-
creased organizational citizenship behaviors (Williams and
Anderson 1991), but it also results from such things that
can be influenced by the DEMO as recruiting and training prac-
tices (Caldwell, Chatman, and O'DEMO 1990), job equity
(Williams and Hazer 1986), and organizational DEMO (Eis-
enberger, Fasolo, and Davis-LaMastro 1990).
In the services DEMO marketing area, Berry and
Parasuraman (1991, p. 139) maintain that "Relationships
are built on the foundation of mutual commitment." Simi-
larly, the process through which consumers become loyal
to specific brands has been DEMO discussed. Initially, loy-
alty was viewed as simply repeat buying. However, as the
field of consumer behavior matured, researchers came to re-
alize that is not sufficient evidence of brand loy-
alty" (Newman and DEMO 1973, p. 404) and that such
measures as purchase patterns included much "spurious loy-
alty" (Day 1970). As brand attitude becomes central to the
repurchase decision in relational exchange, brand loyalty be-
comes increasingly similar to our conceptualization of com-
mitment. In fact, Assael (DEMO, p. 665) defines brand loy-
alty as "commitment to a DEMO brand" arising from cer-
tain positive attitudes. Manufacturers see brand loyalty DEMO
key to superior performance and make efforts to build it
through providing superior benefits, promoting the firm's
values (e.g, "green marketing," corporate philanthropy),
and establishing an image as a trustworthy manufacturer.
DEMO common theme emerges from the various literatures
on relationships: Parties identify DEMO among ex-
change partners as key to achieving valuable outcomes for
themselves, and they endeavor to develop and maintain this
precious attribute in their relationships. Therefore, we theo-
rize that commitment is central to all the relational ex-
changes between the firm and its various partners in Figure
DEMO
Trust
We conceptualize trust as existing when one party has con-
fidence in an exchange partner's reliability and integrity.
Again, our definition parallels that of Moorman, Desh-
pande, and Zaltman (1993, p. 82): "Trust is defined as a
willingness to rely on an exchange DEMO in whom one has
confidence." Both definitions draw on Rotter's (1967, p.
651) classic view that trust is "a generalized expectancy
held by an individual that the word of another ... can be DEMO
lied on." Both definitions also highlight the importance of
confidence. The DEMO on trust suggests that confidence
on the part of the trusting party results from the firm belief
that the trustworthy party is reliable and DEMO high integrity,
which are associated with such qualities as consistent, DEMO
petent, honest, fair, responsible, helpful, and benevolent
(Altman and Taylor 1973; Dwyer and LaGace 1986; Larzel-
ere and Huston 1980; Rotter 1971). Anderson and Narus
(1990, p. 45) focus on the perceived outcomes of trust
when they define it as "the firm's belief that another com-
pany will perform actions that will result DEMO positive out-
comes for the firm as well as not take unexpected actions
that result in negative outcomes." Indeed, we would expect
such DEMO from a partner on whose integrity one can
rely confidently.

genuinely confident. We believe that, though it certainly
would be DEMO to have items incorporating "stated
willingness" in a measure of trust, willingness is unneces-
sary or redundant in its definition. Thus, just DEMO behavioral
intention is best viewed as an outcome of attitude and not
as part of its definition (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), "will-
DEMO to rely" should be viewed as an outcome (or, alter-
DEMO, a potential indicator) of trust and not as a part of
how one defines it.
Like commitment, trust also has been studied widely in
the social exchange literature (Fox 1974; Scanzoni 1979)
and DEMO For example, in organizational behavior, the
study of "norms of DEMO" is considered a characteristic dis-
tinguishing management theory from organizational econom-
DEMO (Barney 1990; Donaldson 1990a). In communications, a
key construct DEMO been source credibility, originally defined
by Hovland, Janis, and Kelley (1953) as trust of the speaker
by the listener. In services marketing, Berry and Para-
suraman (1991, p. 144) find that "customer-company rela-
tionships require trust." Indeed, they contend (p. 107), "DEMO
fective services marketing depends on the management of
trust because the customer typically must buy a service be-
fore experiencing it." In strategic alliances, Sherman
(1992, p. 78) concludes that "the biggest stumbling block
to the success of alliances is the lack of trust." In retailing,
Berry (1993, p. 1) stresses that "trust is the DEMO for loy-
alty." In automobile marketing, Saturn stresses "partner-
ships DEMO which everyone shared risks and rewards," which
emphasizes "win-win role DEMO games stressing mutual
trust" (Advertising Age 1992, p. 13), DEMO competing with
Japanese automakers, says Ford Motor Company, requires
relationships with its suppliers in which "there's a spirit of
trust" (Business Week 1992, p. 27). In buyer-seller bargain-
ing situations, Schurr DEMO Ozanne (1985) find trust to be cen-
tral to the process of achieving cooperative problem solving
and constructive dialogue. As in the organizational DEMO
mentioned previously, they also find trust to lead to higher
levels DEMO loyalty (i.e., commitment) to the bargaining part-
ner. Finally, trust is viewed as central in studies conducted
by the Industrial Marketing and DEMO Group (Ford
1990 and Hakansson 1982). Therefore, we theorize that
trust is central to all relational exchanges in Figure 1.
Trust Influences DEMO Commitment
Trust is so important to relational exchange that Spekman
(1988, p. 79) postulates it to be "the cornerstone of the stra-
DEMO partnership." Why? Because relationships character-
ized by trust are so highly valued that parties will desire to
commit themselves to such relationships (Hrebiniak 1974).
Indeed, because commitment entails vulnerability, parties
will seek only DEMO partners. Social exchange theory
explains this causal relationship through the principle of gen-
eralized reciprocity, which holds that "mistrust breeds mis-
trust and DEMO such would also serve to decrease commitment
in the relationship and shift the transaction to one of more
direct short-term exchanges" (McDonald 1981, p. 834).
Therefore, we posit, as does Achrol (1991), that trust is a
major determinant of relationship commitment. Corroborat-

ing our hypothesis, Moorman, Zaltman, DEMO Deshpande
(1992) find that trust by marketing research users in their re-
search providers significantly affected user commitment to
the research relationship.
Precursors DEMO Relationship Commitment and Trust
Drawing on two decades of theory and empirical research
on commitment in organization behavior (see reviews by
Reichers 1986; DEMO and Zajac 1990) and the recently de-
veloping commitment and trust DEMO in marketing, we
identify five major precursors of relationship commitment
and DEMO Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we posit that
(1) relationship termination costs and relationship benefits
directly influence commitment, (2) shared values directly in-
fluence both commitment and trust, and (3) communication
and opportunistic behavior directly influence trust (and,
through trust, indirectly DEMO commitment).
Relationship termination costs. A common assumption
in the relationship marketing literature is that a terminated
party will seek an alternative relationship and DEMO "switch-
ing costs," which lead to dependence (Heide and John
1988; Jackson 1985). Such costs are exacerbated by idiosyn-
cratic investments, that is, investments that are difficult to
switch to another relationship (Heide and John 1988).
Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987, DEMO 14) propose that "the
buyer's anticipation of high switching costs gives rise to
the buyer's interest in maintaining a quality relationship."DEMO
However, it is certainly possible that no "switch" would
occur DEMO the relationship dissolves. For example, a termi-
nated distributor retailer might DEMO (willingly or unwill-
ingly) to discontinue carrying an entire line of merchandise.
Even though no alternative relationship is established (and
no switch is made), there nevertheless will be costs incurred
from termination. Termination costs DEMO, therefore, all ex-
pected losses from termination and result from the per-
ceived lack of comparable potential alternative partners, re-
lationship dissolution expenses, and/or substantial switch-
ing costs. These expected termination costs lead to an ongo-
ing relationship being viewed as important, thus generating
commitment to the relationship. The "expected" in our
conceptualization emphasizes that many business DEMO
ships are characterized by great uncertainty. Indeed, facing
termination costs that DEMO actually very high, a partner may
be blissfully unaware of this DEMO and not be committed to
the trading partner. Conversely, facing total DEMO that are ac-
tually very low, a partner unfoundedly may fear DEMO termi-
nated and be committed. Thus, it is the expectation of DEMO
costs that produces commitment.
Relationship benefits. Competition-particularly in the
global marketplace-requires that firms continually seek
out products, processes, and technologies that add value DEMO
their own offerings. Relationship marketing theory suggests
that partner selection may be a critical element in competi-
tive strategy. As Webster (1991, p. DEMO) notes for industrial
marketers, "the firm's procurement strategy may DEMO the
most important ingredient in its ability to deliver superior
value to its customers" (emphasis in original). Because part-
ners that deliver DEMO benefits will be highly valued,
firms will commit themselves to establishing, developing,
or
and maintaining relationships with such partners. Malcolm
Baldrige Award winner Motorola recognizes DEMO "two-way
street" characteristic of relational exchange and conducts
quarterly confidential suppliers
own performance to its exchange
ners (Moody 1992). Therefore, we DEMO that
ceive superior benefits from their partnership-relative to
other options-on such dimensions as product
customer satisfaction, performance,
mitted to the relationship.
Shared values. Shared values, the only concept that we
posit as being a direct precursor of both relationship commit-
ment and trust, is the extent to which partners have beliefs
in common about what behaviors, goals, and DEMO are im-
portant or unimportant, appropriate or inappropriate, and
right or wrong. For example, Heide and John's (1992)
"norms," because they refer to "appropriate actions," are
shared values. Similarly, DEMO, Schurr, and Oh (1987, p.
21) theorize that shared DEMO contribute to the develop-
ment of commitment and trust.
Values are fundamental to definitions of organizational
culture (Enz 1988; Weiner 1988). Schein (1990, p. 111)
holds that we can "distinguish three fundamental DEMO at
which culture manifests itself: (a) observable artifacts, (b)DEMO
values, and (c) basic underlying assumptions." Values re-
flect culture when they are widely and strongly held
(Schein 1990; Weiner 1988)DEMO Because it provides what
many believe to be the best measure of person-organization
fit in employment settings (Caldwell and O'Reilly 1990;
Chatman 1991), shared values has become a variable of
great interest to DEMO researchers, especially in the
organizational commitment literature (Chatman 1991). Kel-
man's (1961) seminal work hypothesized that people's atti-
tudes DEMO behaviors result from (1) rewards or punish-
ments, or "compliance"; (2) the desire to be associated
with another person or DEMO, or "identification"; or (3) hav-
ing the same values as another person or group, or "interal-
ization." Hence, the DEMO commitment literature
often distinguishes between two kinds of commitment: (1)
that brought about by a person sharing, identifying with, or
internalizing DEMO values of the organization and (2) that
brought about by a cognitive evaluation of the instrumental
worth of a continued relationship with the DEMO, that
is, by adding up the gains and losses, pluses DEMO minuses,
or rewards and punishments. Consistent with the organiza-
tional behavior literature, we posit that when exchange part-
ners share values, they DEMO will be more committed to
their relationships, but our definition of DEMO is neu-
tral to whether it is brought about by instrumental or identi-
surveys

cation, which "can be DEMO broadly as the formal as well
as informal sharing of meaningful and timely information be-
tween firms" (Anderson and Narus 1990, p. 44). Commu-
nication, especially timely communication (Moorman, Desh-
pande, and DEMO 1993), fosters trust by assisting in re-
solving disputes and aligning perceptions and expectations
(Etgar 1979). Anderson and Narus (1990) note that past com-
munication is an antecedent of trust, but "In DEMO pe-
riods ... this accumulation
of trust
leads to better
communi-
cation" (p. 45). Because we, like Anderson and Narus, test
DEMO model at a specific point in time, we posit that a DEMO
ner's perception that past communications from another
party have been frequent and of high quality-that is, rele-
vant, timely, and reliable-this will result in greater trust. Al-
though "communication can be described as the glue that
holds together a channel of distribution, ... empirical re-
search on channel communication is sparse" (Mohr and
Nevin 1990, p. 36). Nonetheless, Anderson and Narus
(1990) find that, from both DEMO manufacturer's and distribu-
tor's perspectives, past communication was positively DEMO
lated to trust. Anderson and Weitz (1989) also find that com-
munication was positively related to trust in channels.
Opportunistic behavior. The concept DEMO opportunistic be-
havior from the transaction cost analysis literature is de-
fined as "self-interest seeking with guile" (Williamson
1975, p. 6). DEMO such, "the essence of opportunistic behav-
ior is deceit-oriented violation of implicit or explicit prom-
ises about one's appropriate or required role DEMO"
(John 1984, p. 279). Because opportunistic behavior in or-
ganization economics "is assumed in the fundamental axi-
oms, rather than DEMO contingently ... this is guilt by
axiom" (Donaldson 1990b, p. DEMO). Even though guileful,
self-interest maximization is axiomatic in transaction cost
analysis, empirical research indicates that human behavior
may not be so Machiavellian after all, especially not behav-
ior in long-run relationships (Bonoma 1976; John 1984).
As originally suggested by Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987),
incorporating trust in models of distribution channel relation-
ships provides a unique vantage point for treating opportun-

when a party believes that a partner engages DEMO opportunis-
tic behavior, such perceptions will lead to decreased trust.
Rather DEMO positing a direct effect from opportunistic behav-
ior to relationship commitment, DEMO postulate that such be-
havior results in decreased relationship commitment be-
cause partners believe they can no longer trust their
partners.
Outcomes of Relationship DEMO and Trust
Although, as components of the relationship development
process, relationship commitment and trust are, per se,
highly desirable "qualitative outcomes" (Mohr and Nevin
1990), we posit five additional qualitative outcomes. First,
acquiescence and propensity to leave directly flow from re-
lationship commitment. DEMO, functional conflict and un-
certainty are the direct results of trust. DEMO, and most im-
portantly, we propose that cooperation arises directly from
both relationship commitment and trust. We theorize that
these outcomes, especially the crucial factor of cooperation,
promote relationship marketing success. Because we model
DEMO test these outcomes at a single point in time, we refer DEMO
the partner's perceptions about these future outcomes when
commitment and trust are present.
Acquiescence and propensity to leave. Drawing on the
organizational behavior DEMO (Steers 1977), we define
acquiescence as the degree to which DEMO partner accepts or ad-
heres to another's specific requests or policies, and we posit

that coordinated, joint efforts will lead to outcomes that ex-
ceed what the firm would achieve if it acted solely in its
own best DEMO"
Functional conflict. There always will be disagreements
or "conflict" in relational exchanges (Dwyer, Schurr, and
Oh 1987). The hostility and bitterness resulting from dis-
agreements not being resolved amicably can lead to DEMO pa-
thological consequences as relationship dissolution. How-
ever, when disputes are DEMO amicably, such disagree-
ments can be referred to as "functional conflict," because
they prevent stagnation, stimulate interest and curiosity,
and provide a "medium through which problems can be
aired and solutions arrived at" (Deutsch 1969, p. 19). Func-
tional conflict, therefore, may increase productivity in rela-

Decision-making uncertainty. Uncertainty in decision
making refers to the extent DEMO which a partner (1) has
enough information to make key decisions, (2) can predict
the consequences of those decisions, and (3) has confidence
in those decisions (Achrol and Stern 1988). We DEMO that

fore, "stability" is a desirable performance outcome
(Kumar, Stern, and Achrol DEMO) that we posit can be
achieved through fostering commitment.
Cooperation. Cooperation, from the Latin co, meaning
"together," and operari, "to DEMO," refers to situations in
which parties work together to achieve mutual goals (Ander-
son and Narus 1990). Even though coordination, which DEMO
plies cooperation, has been known to be essential in such
areas DEMO channels of distribution for decades, the marketing
literature on relationships has DEMO disproportionately on
power and conflict as focal constructs. For example, Ster
DEMO El-Ansary (1992, p. 312) point out that a "central
theme" of channels of distribution theory and research is
that "interorganizational coordination DEMO required within a
marketing channel." But they go on to maintain DEMO it is
the exercise of power that is crucial for much coordination:
"Power generally must be used in a marketing channel to
... gain cooperation and induce satisfactory role perfor-
mance." Why the focus on power? Because, as the epi-
graph quote from Alderson reminds us, marketers have
long noted the absence of a theory that explains coopera-
DEMO The commitment-trust theory contributes to that long-
sought goal.
Harking back to the paradox of relationship marketing,
effective cooperation within a network promotes DEMO
competition among networks. Therefore, cooperation pro-
motes relationship marketing success. Because DEMO
behaviors can coexist temporally with cooperative actions,
cooperation is not simply the absence of conflict (Frazier
1983). For example, partners can DEMO ongoing disputes
about goals but continue to cooperate because both parties'
relationship termination costs are high. Nor is cooperation
the same thing as DEMO Cooperation is proactive; ac-
quiescence is reactive. Passively agreeing to advertise DEMO part-
ner's product is acquiescence; proactively suggesting better
advertisements is DEMO
Cooperation is the only outcome posited to be influ-
enced directly by both relationship commitment and trust.
A partner committed to the relationship will DEMO with
another member because of a desire to make the relation-
ship work. Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that
trust also leads to DEMO Deutsch's (1960) findings,
using prisoner's dilemma experiments, DEMO that the ini-
tiation of cooperation requires trust, and Pruitt (1981) sug-
gests that a party will undertake high-risk, coordinated be-
haviors DEMO trust exists. Similarly, Anderson and Narus

and
A Rival Model
An emerging consensus DEMO structural equations modeling is
that researchers should compare rival models, not DEMO test a
proposed model (Bollen and Long 1992). What, then,
would be a rival model? Note that our model posits that re-
lationship termination costs, relationship benefits, shared val-
ues, communication, DEMO opportunistic behavior-all of
which have been associated with important outcomes in
past research-influence their outcomes only through the
key mediating variables of relationship commitment DEMO
trust. Because our extremely parsimonious model permits
no direct path from any of the five variables to any out-
come, it implies a central nomological status for relation-
ship commitment and trust. A nonparsimonious rival view
DEMO is equally extreme would be one positing only direct
paths from each of the precursors to the outcomes, thereby
making relationship commitment and trust nomologically
similar to the five antecedents. The rival model (see Figure
3), therefore, allows no indirect effects; in other words, re-
lationship commitment and trust are not allowed to mediate
any of the relationships. DEMO no one has theorized the
rival model, it is implied by DEMO numerous discussions and
empirical studies that consider relationship termination
costs, relationship DEMO, shared values, communication,
and opportunistic behavior to be "independent DEMO" di-
rectly influencing outcomes. Examples include communica-
tion and cooperation (Assael 1969); opportunism and uncer-
tainty (Williamson 1985, p. 58); DEMO and rela-
tionship "continuity," which conceptually parallels "pro-
pensity to leave" (Anderson and Weitz 1989); shared val-
ues leading to DEMO propensity to leave (Chatman
1991); and relationship termination costs leading DEMO cooper-
ation and/or decreased propensity to leave (Schermerhor
1975; Skinner, Gassenheimer, and Kelley 1992; Spekman
and Salmond 1992).
Method
Research Design
As the research setting, we used a national sample of inde-
pendent automobile tire retailers. Although this industry
has elements of vertical integration, it still has independent
dealers. Because most tire retailers carry a small DEMO of
tire lines, their relationships with suppliers are potentially
important enough DEMO the research issues to be meaningful.
Restricting the sample to this somewhat homogeneous
population minimized extraneous sources of variation (a
plus), and the relatively large number of producers and ex-
treme competitive pressures due to DEMO at the time

of research increased the likelihood of there being large var-
iance to DEMO explained (a large plus).
Preliminary investigation. The study began by DEMO
tory field work that included soliciting the assistance of
local chapters of the National Tire Dealers and Retreaders
Association (NTDRA). In-depth, on-site DEMO with of-
ficers of nine tire retailers in a medium-sized Southwestern
city explored issues related to tire manufacturer/dealer rela-
tionships. From these interviews (and the literature review
discussed previously), a draft questionnaire was constructed
DEMO pretested on site with the same nine tire retailers. Re-
spondents were encouraged to identify unclear items, com-
ment on the importance of the research issues, and suggest
changes. After making the required modifications, the DEMO
NTDRA chapter assisted in mailing questionnaires to a re-
gional sample of tire retailers to determine if respondents
could/would complete the questionnaire in DEMO absence of a
researcher. No problems were presented during this stage,
and the final draft of the questionnaire was developed.
Data Collection
Data DEMO collected using a self-administered questionnaire
sent to member firms of the NTDRA in two phases. During
the first, multiple copies of questionnaires were mailed to
the presidents of the seven largest U.S. chapters of
NTDRA, all of whom had agreed to participate. We ex-
pected that, like Goolsby and Hunt (1992), using local chap-
ters of the trade association would yield a higher response
rate than a mass mailing. Association presidents DEMO
a total of 341 packets of questionnaires, introductory letters,
and DEMO reply envelopes to members at their monthly
chapter meetings. After members returned only 49
(14.37%), it was decided that a mass mailing not only
would allow for direct researcher control over questionnaire
distribution but also DEMO be as effective as the continued
use of local chapters. In phase two, therefore, 1000 packets
were mailed to independent NTDRA members (new tire
dealers only) chosen at random from the most recent mem-
bership directory-after excluding all those in metropolitan
areas previously surveyed. Returned questionnaires totaled
DEMO, for a response rate of 12.9% and an overall sample
size DEMO 204 and response rate of 14.6% (204/1394)1.

in so-

ing an initial test of a theoretical model in a particular con-
text. The important issues here are (1) whether DEMO sample
is an appropriate context for testing our theory and (2)DEMO
whether our sample of respondents has variance to be ex-
plained. Because we are not attempting to generalize an es-
tablished model to a DEMO population or project a descriptive
statistic from a sample to some larger population, the possi-
bility of nonresponse bias is a nonissue in research such as
ours (Hunt 1990).

perience (< 10 years, 6.6%; 11-20 years, 26.5%; 21-30

males (DEMO). The firms represented in the sample varied
in size, as DEMO by annual sales (< $500,000, 11.3%;
$500,001-$1 million, 29.0%; $1-$2 million, 26.9%; $2-$5

age respondent purchased DEMO (range = 10-100%, s.d. =

fied as their "major supplier."

DEMO measures were analyzed for validity and reliability fol-

Wood, and Chonko (1989). Shared values then were calcu-
lated as the difference between the two responses sub-
tracted from 7 (to make high numbers indicate high shared
values). Items reflecting ethical values were chosen because
such DEMO are thought to be foundational in relational ex-
changes (Gundlach and DEMO 1993) and because Hunt,
Wood, and Chonko (1989, p. 86) find shared ethical values
to be "a significant and substantive DEMO of organiza-
tional commitment" in marketing.
Consequences of relationship commitment and DEMO To
measure cooperation, we adapted the scale developed by
Brown (1979). No scales exist for measuring the buyer's per-
ception of DEMO acquiescence to the supplier's policies. Be-
cause measures of self-reported intentions to perform spe-
cific behaviors (e.g., voting for a given candidate) com-
monly employ single items, a single item measure was used
for intended acquiescent behavior. The propensity to leave
measure was adapted from Bluedom'DEMO (1982) measure of
employees' propensity to leave the organization. We DEMO
oped a two-item scale that measures perceptions of future
functional conflict. The uncertainty measure was adapted
from Achrol and Stem's (1988) scales DEMO adequacy of avail-
able information (UINFO) and the degree of confidence of
the decision maker when making these decisions
(UCONF).

The correlations in Table 1 provide an initial DEMO of the

supported at the p < .01 level. The absolute values of the cor-

For a DEMO stronger test of the hypotheses, we now test the
proposed model DEMO LISREL, thereby holding constant

Testing the KMV Model
The KMV model was tested using LISREL VII and the co-
variance matrix shown in Table 1. Each DEMO load-
ing was fixed at .950 for the formative measure summates
and at each scale's coefficient alpha for reflective measure
summates. The exogenous DEMO were allowed to corre-
late by freeing the (I matrix. The DEMO, shown in Table 2,
indicate support (p < .01) DEMO 12 of the 13 hypothesized
paths of the model, and 24 DEMO 27 indirect paths. The pro-
posed structural model's comparative fit index, CFI
(Bentler 1990), of .890 indicates a good fit, especially for a
model with such a large number of constructs. Overall, the
KMV model performs well.
Building relationship commitment and trust. With the ex-
DEMO of relationship benefits -> relationship commit-
ment, all hypothesized paths from the antecedents to relation-
ship commitment and trust were supported. Furthermore,
DEMO squared multiple correlations (SMCs) for the structural
equations for relationship commitment and trust were high.
Over half of the variance (SMC = .552) in relationship com-
mitment was explained by the direct effects of relationship
termination costs, shared values, and trust, and the indirect
effects of shared values, communication, and opportunistic
behavior. For trust, even more of the variance was ex-
plained (SMC = .743) by the direct DEMO of shared values,
communication, and opportunistic behavior.
Outcomes of developing DEMO commitment and
trust. All the paths leading to the five outcomes were signif-
icant at the p < .001 level. The standardized estimates for

Brett 1982).
Importantly,
significant direct DEMO in the rival are significant direct or
indirect effects in the KMV model (the exceptions are
relationship benefits -- propensity to leave and relationship
benefits -> cooperation). Moreover, little, if any, additional
explanatory DEMO is gained from the additional 16 paths.
The rival's SMCs are acquiescence = .395, propensity to
leave = .352, cooperation = .561, functional conflict = .235,
and uncertainty = .153. The largest increment DEMO SMC was
.080 (for acquiescence) and the mean increment only .058.
Though the CFI for the rival model is slightly higher
(CFI = .959 versus .890), only 11 of 29 (37.9%) of its DEMO
pothesized paths are supported at the p < .05 level (includ-
DEMO only 7 of 29 (24.1%) supported at p < .01). In contrast,
12 of 13 hypothesized paths (92.3%) in the DEMO model
are supported at the p < .01 level. 9 of the 11
The total coefficient of determination for the rival is actu-
ally less DEMO that of the KMV model (.805 versus .810).
As is DEMO from Figures 2 and 3, there is a great dif-
ference DEMO parsimony between the KMV and rival models
(13 versus 29 paths)DEMO Because CFI does not account for par-
simony differences, we compare DEMO two models using
PNFI. Because PNFI is informed by both the goodness of
fit of the model and its parsimony, one commonly finds
that goodness of fit indices in the .90s translate to parsimo-
nious fit DEMO less than .60 (Mulaik et al. 1989). The
KMV model'DEMO PNFI of .555 exceeds the rival's .228. Al-
though no guidelines exist for determining what is a signif-
icant difference in PNFI values, we note that to accomplish
a 7.8% improvement in CFI (from .890 to .959), one sacri-
fices 41.1% in PNFI (from .555 to .228). Such a sacrifice, it
would seem, is too great. DEMO conversely, we accomplish
a great improvement in parsimony (from 29 paths to 13
paths) by sacrificing only 7.8% in CFI-a sacrifice seem-
ingly worth making for the sake of parsimony.
Discussion
We first address the DEMO of conceptualizing relation-
ship commitment and trust as mediators of important rela-
tional variables. Then we discuss directions for further
research.
Relationship Commitment and DEMO as Key
Mediating Constructs
In relationship marketing, what are the roles DEMO commit-
ment and trust? Are relationship commitment and trust just
two DEMO "independent" variables that influence outcomes
or are they somehow central to relationship marketing suc-
cess? Theorizing that commitment and trust are key varia-
bles that mediate successful relationship marketing, we de-
velop a causal model containing 13 hypotheses that we test
in the context of automobile tire DEMO Correlation
analysis supported all 13 hypotheses and structural equa-
tion modeling, DEMO more powerful test, supports 12 of the 13
hypotheses. Not only DEMO our hypothesized antecedents ex-
plain over half the variance in relationship commitment and
trust, they also explain a substantial amount of the vari-
ances in five outcomes, including almost half of the vari-
ance of the crucial variable, cooperation. If cooperative re-
lationships are required for relationship marketing success,
our results suggest that commitment and trust are, indeed,
key.
Recognizing that our model is both parsimonious (13
paths) and DEMO (only indirect paths are allowed from
the five exogenous to the DEMO outcome variables), we com-
pare it with a rival that is nonparsimonious (29 paths), but
equally extreme (no indirect paths are DEMO). Although
customary goodness of fit measures show acceptable fit for
both models, parsimony clearly favors the key mediating var-
iable view. Even though the rival has over twice the paths
(29 versus 13), the extra 16 paths from the "independent"
variables explain only a marginal amount of additional var-
iance. Examining the paths not supported in the DEMO also
suggests that the KMV model best represents reality. Surpris-
ingly, DEMO a single antecedent in the rival is significantly re-
lated to more than two outcomes-even though all these an-
tecedent variables have been widely DEMO as impor-
tant in exchange relationships. The KMV model explains
this surprising finding by showing that the antecedents do af-
fect these outcomes significantly, but only through the key
mediating variables of relationship commitment and trust. DEMO
deed, all 18 of the indirect effects of the antecedents on DEMO
outcomes are supported (p < .01).
Finally, when corrected for parsimony, the overall fit of
the rival model is less than half that of the KMV model. Phi-
losophically, parsimony is a characteristic of theories that
science has cherished since at least the 14th century, when
William of Ockham developed the principle now known as
Ockham's razor. DEMO of science long have argued
that the objective of science is not only to explain, predict,
and understand the world in which we live, but to do so in
as efficient a manner as possible. Lambert and Brittan
(1970, p. 69), discuss the reasons that DEMO, or "sim-
plicity," has been so important in science: "Certainly of
two hypotheses equally satisfactory in other respects, we ha-
bitually choose the simpler. Reasons are not hard to find.
The simpler hypothesis DEMO usually the more elegant, more
convenient to work with, more easily understood, remem-
bered, and communicated." The emphasis on parsimony in
the structural equations modeling literature is fully in ac-
cord with philosophy of DEMO (Bentler and Mooijaart
1989). Therefore, if the job of marketing science is, when-
ever possible, to explain marketing phenomena parsimoni-
ously, our results clearly support the theory that commit-
ment and trust are DEMO mediating variables that contribute
to relationship marketing success.
Relationship marketing success, DEMO all its contexts, re-
quires cooperative behaviors. Indeed, as Van de Ven (1976,
p. 25) puts it, "the end objective DEMO organizations involved
in an [interorganizational relationship] is the attainment of
goals that are unachievable by organizations independ-
ently." In the rival model, only DEMO benefits and op-
portunistic behavior were found to affect cooperation signif-
icantly. In the KMV model, however, all antecedents (ex-
cept relationship benefits) were found to affect cooperation
significantly, and similar results were found DEMO the other im-
portant outcomes as well. These findings imply that relation-
ship commitment and trust are not only important variables
in marketing relationships, as proposed by other researchers
(Achrol 1991; Becker 1960; Dwyer, DEMO, and Oh 1987),
but also are key mediating variables in these relationships.
Identifying commitment and trust as key mediating var-
iables is DEMO to the study and management of relation-
ship marketing. To the researcher, if relationship commit-
ment and trust were merely two more independent antece-
dents of important relationship outcomes, failing to include
their effects in studies of relationship marketing processes
simply would result in less variance explained among DEMO
outcomes. However, as key mediating variables, failing to in-
clude their effects in such studies would result in flawed con-
clusions regarding not DEMO the direct impact of relationship
commitment and trust on important outcomes, DEMO the im-
pact of other antecedents as well. To the manager, DEMO

Directions for Further Research
Alternative approaches to DEMO measurement. Al-
though our measures performed well, it is certainly possible
DEMO better (or at least different) measures could be con-
structed for several of the constructs. For example, relation-
ship termination costs appear to increase relationship com-
mitment. Further research could explore types of termina-
tion DEMO other than the economic costs studied here. None-
conomic costs, including DEMO loss of "social satisfaction
from the association" (Dwyer, Schurr, DEMO Oh 1987, p. 14),
as well as such sociopsychological costs as worry, aggrava-
tion, and perceived loss of reputation or "face," also could
contribute to the development of relationship commitment.
The hypothesized DEMO of relationship benefits on rela-
tionship commitment was unsupported-even though the
simple correlation (r = .316) was positive and significant.
(Such surprising findings as this show the value of struc-
tural equations modeling.) One possible measurement-
related explanation for this finding is that relationship ben-
efits were DEMO as an evaluation of the supplier on the
facets of gross profit, customer satisfaction, and product per-
formance. In the future, researchers could address other po-
tential benefits. Note that we measure relationship benefits
in DEMO comparative sense, that is, benefits of the supplier com-
pared with those of a likely alternative supplier. Perhaps
many respondents lacked information as DEMO the characteris-
tics of alternative suppliers, or they had a tendency DEMO focus
on the absolute level of benefits, not the relative benefits. DEMO
is worth noting that the variance in relationship benefits
was one of the smallest of all studied variables (s.d. =
1.097). In the future, researchers could try measuring satis-
faction with absolute levels of benefits.
By measuring
shared
values in terms of shared
ethical
values, they contributed significantly to the development of
both relationship commitment and trust. However, other
types of shared values-for example, relating to product
quality, promotion tactics, or customer service-also could
further the development of commitment and trust in DEMO
tional exchanges. For example, researchers could focus on
the "norms" DEMO by Heide and John (1992).
Finally, less than 11% of the variance in uncertainty
was explained by our model-the lowest for any DEMO
Given the wide range of idiosyncratic environmental fac-
tors that undoubtedly affect each respondent's uncertainty,
such low explained variance is unsurprising. However, it is
also possible that the types of decisions that the measure DEMO
dressed-that is, adequacy of information and confidence
in decisions for promotion DEMO and inventory-may not
be as heavily influenced by trust in the trading partner as
are others. In the future, researchers could explore other fac-
ets of the business, such as the provision of warranty ser-
vice, investment in relationship-specific assets, or searching
for alternative trading partners. For DEMO, we would ex-
pect that marketers who trust their trading partners DEMO

feel more sure-that is, less uncertain-about excluding po-
tential alternate suppliers from consideration.
Further developing the KMV model. Although our tests
of the two competing models suggest that DEMO KMV model
better conceptualizes the roles of commitment and trust, al-
DEMO for direct effects for some antecedents is suggested.
Of the five antecedents studied, opportunistic behavior dis-
played the largest effects, both direct and DEMO The sizes
of the rival model's direct paths from opportunistic behav-
ior to the outcomes suggest that opportunistic behavior also
may influence one DEMO more outcomes directly. Indeed, the
LISREL modification indices suggest paths from DEMO
istic behavior to cooperation and uncertainty. Therefore, we
urge researchers to DEMO an "extended" KMV model
that allows for both direct and indirect paths from opportun-
istic behavior to these variables.
Our results indicate that DEMO influences the way in
which disagreements and arguments are perceived by ex-
change partners. When trust is present, parties will view
such conflict as functional. Therefore, they can discuss prob-
lems openly because they do not fear malevolent actions by
their partners. Both the modification indices for the DEMO
posed model and the results of the rival model suggest that
communication also can lead directly to conflict being per-
ceived as functional (independent of the indirect path
through trust). This "dual path" possibility DEMO lend sup-
port to Mohr and Nevin's (1990) view that effective commu-
nication is crucial for obtaining high performance. Further
research investigating DEMO extended KMV model should de-
termine whether this "dual path" holds elsewhere.
Our test failed to support a path from relationship bene-
fits DEMO relationship commitment. Although this failure may
be related to the measurement issues previously discussed,
structural explanations also may exist. One would expect
that DEMO level of benefits received from the relationship
would be related strongly to both satisfaction with those ben-
efits and satisfaction with the overall relationship. DEMO sat-
isfaction customarily shows a strong relationship with all
forms of commitment (Williams and Hazer 1986)-which
may explain our positive (simple) correlation of benefits to
commitment. However, one also would expect strong asso-
ciations between global satisfaction and our other ex-
ogenous variables (e.g., communication)DEMO Therefore, there
may be a global satisfaction "halo effect" that DEMO in
the apparent relationship between benefits and commitment
disappearing when all exogenous variables are included in
the analysis. Researchers may need to include this DEMO ef-
fect explicitly in their models.
Interestingly, though our results indicate DEMO both com-
mitment and trust are important for achieving cooperation,
the parameter values suggest that trust has the strongest ef-
fect. Our measure DEMO cooperation included cooperation
across five different facets of the business. Would this find-
ing hold for other forms of cooperation? Furthermore, what
forms DEMO cooperation are most conducive to success? The or-

ute to relationship marketing success? These questions war-
rant further research.
DEMO the important outcomes we study here is acqui-
escence. Why do firms acquiesce to or comply with the de-
sires of others? Marketing's traditional answer has been
that compliance results from the exercise (or one's fear of
the exercise) of power, which, since Hunt and Nevin
(1974), customarily has been divided into two types, coer-
DEMO and noncoercive. However, to many academics, as
well as to most practitioners, the term power implies, or at
least strongly connotes, coercion, that is, "do this or else!"
If one does not have the ability to force compliance, then
one may be said to have some degree of influence, but not
genuine power. For these academics and practitioners, non-
coercive power is at best a non sequitur and at worst an ox-
ymoron. In this vein, Young and Wilkinson (DEMO, p. 109)
argue that marketing's emphasis on power and DEMO as
key concepts for studying channels has "distorted the under-
standing DEMO how channels functioned. The emphasis was on
sick rather
than
healthy
relationships."
Instead of acquiescence resulting from the exercise of
power, as in sick relationships, our results support the view
that in "healthy" relationships partners acquiesce because
of their commitment to the relationship. In short, whereas
the exercise of coercive power yields compliance because
firms are compelled to DEMO so, firms committed to the rela-
tionship acquiesce because they want DEMO do so. Long-run re-
lationship success, we argue, is more likely to be associated
with the absence of the exercise of coercive power DEMO the
presence of commitment and trust. The preceding notwith-
standing, the DEMO theory of relationship mar-
keting does not deny the importance of understanding
power. Just as medical science should understand both sick-
ness and health, marketing science should understand both
functional and dysfunctional relationships. Just as the DEMO
model incorporates opportunistic behavior and its dysfunc-
tional consequences, so also DEMO an extended KMV model

ship commitment and trust over the long term will decrease
cooperation and diminish overall relationship success.
Power, then, like opportunistic behavior, helps us to under-
stand relationship marketing failures. DEMO marketing science
should turn toward explaining relationship marketing suc-
cess-and we believe it should-power cannot be the cen-
tral construct.
Limitations
The first limitation DEMO the cross-sectional design employed.
In any model in which causality is suggested, longitudinal
studies provide for stronger inferences. Thus, the model de-
veloped DEMO tested here could benefit from being tested in
a longitudinal design.
Second, the context of our study, automobile tire retail-
ers, limits its potential generalizability. On average, respon-
dents in our sample purchased roughly half (54%) of their
tire inventory from the supplier they identified as DEMO
"major supplier." Certainly, some firms in other industries
would purchase DEMO of their inventories from their major
suppliers (e.g., franchising operations such as automobile
dealerships), and firms offering a broader assortment of
goods DEMO services (e.g., mass merchandisers, supermarkets)
would purchase much less DEMO a single supplier. Perhaps
in industries in which the percentage of retailers' total pur-
chases from single suppliers differs markedly from the
range in our sample, the structure of relationships might be
different. Therefore, not DEMO would strict replication using
automobile tire retailers be useful, but extending DEMO study
to other partnerships is definitely required. Because we the-
orize that commitment and trust are key mediating varia-
bles in all ten forms DEMO relationship marketing, testing our
baseline model in such areas as strategic DEMO, total qual-
ity management efforts, public-purpose partnerships, and
"internal marketing" programs is required. Our reading of
the literature in all forms of relationship marketing leads us
to believe that the commitment-trust theory underlying the
DEMO model should apply for all relational exchanges-but
only further empirical work can confirm or disconfirm this.

Conclusion
We explore the DEMO of relationship marketing, its concep-
tualization, forms, and requisites for DEMO Relationship
marketing, we propose, refers to all marketing activities di-
rected toward establishing, developing, and maintaining suc-
cessful relational exchanges. With regard DEMO any firm, there
are ten forms of relationship marketing, which can be
grouped into the relational exchanges involving suppliers,
lateral organizations, customers, or one's own employees or
business units. The need for relationship marketing stems
from the changing dynamics of the global marketplace and
the DEMO requirements for competitive success. Some-
what paradoxically, to be an effective DEMO in today's
global marketplace requires one to be an effective coopera-
tor in some network of organizations. If being an effective
cooperator in DEMO network is a prerequisite to being a suc-
cessful competitor, what DEMO the requisites for being a suc-
cessful cooperator? The commitment-trust theory DEMO
that those networks characterized by relationship commit-
ment and trust engender cooperation (in addition to acquies-
cence, a reduced tendency to leave the DEMO, the belief
that conflict will be functional, and reduced uncertainty).
All these "qualitative outcomes" contribute to overall net-
work performance. If DEMO and trust are key, how
can such characteristics be nurtured? We posit that relation-
ship commitment and trust develop when firms attend to DEMO
lationships by (1) providing resources, opportunities, and
benefits that are superior to the offerings of alternative part-
ners; (2) maintaining high standards of corporate values
and allying oneself with exchange partners having similar
DEMO; (3) communicating valuable information, including
expectations, market intelligence, and evaluations of the part-
ner's performance; and (4) avoiding malevolently taking ad-
vantage of their exchange partners. Such actions will enable
firms DEMO their networks to enjoy sustainable competitive
advantages over their rivals and their networks in the global
marketplace. Our initial test of the KMV model DEMO relation-
ship commitment and trust in the context of a channel of
distribution has been encouraging. However, much more
work must be done. Our theory and the model need further
explication, replication, extension, application, DEMO critical
evaluation. We offer them to the marketing discipline and
marketing practice for all these purposes.
