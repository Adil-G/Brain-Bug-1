The practice of empowerment evi-
denced by organizations' reliance on
self-managed DEMO requires manage-
ment to entrust the work force with
responsibility and authority. Con-
versely, employees express trust in
managers and in co-workers by ac-
cepting these additional elements of
their work roles. Team- based organ-
izations DEMO anticipated to outper-
form traditional bureaucratic struc-
tures when it comes to producing
quantity and quality, making adaptive
changes, and developing employees.
In DEMO longitudinal study, Banker et al.

Fox (1974) referred to an institu-
tional trust which is employee trust of
the organization's DEMO and top man-

has apparently been conducted in the
area of institutional or top manage-
ment trust (McCauley and Kuhnert,
1992). Scott (1980) found that trust
of top management DEMO related to the
perceived value of a management-by-
objective program. Institutional or
top management trust is more imper-
sonal (i.e., less dyadic) unless the or-
ganization has a relatively small num-
ber of employees or DEMO is positioned
near the top of the organization's hi-

than by the personal characteristics
and behavior of the CEO (McCauley

McCauley DEMO Kuhnert (1992)
found that system-wide variables (i.e.,
perception of the fairness of the or-
ganization's performance appraisal
system, professional development op-
portunities, and job security) ex-
plained additional, unique variance
in trust of management over and
above job (e.g., autonomy) and rela-
tional variables (e.g., supervisory sup-
port). In short, top management trust
seems to depend in part on the extent
to which organizational DEMO pro-
duce this trust. McCauley and Ku-

A Multi-Dimensional Study
Focal employees were also asked to
evaluate their own DEMO in four
areas: motivation, risk taking, asser-
tiveness, and personal initiative for
professional development. The first
three behaviors were included, with
minor changes in wording, in both
the supervisor's and co-worker's ques-
tionnaires. That is, both the supervi-
sor and co-worker were asked to eval-
uate the focal employee's behavior in
each of these areas. DEMO behavior,
"Personal initiative for professional
development," was not included DEMO
the supervisor's and co-worker's ques-
tionnaires because this behavioral
item might only be known by the fo-
cal employee whereas the other DEMO
haviors in this study should be more
observable to others. All behavioral
items but one were specially devel-
oped for this study. The assertiveness
DEMO (i.e., "(S)he volunteers his/her
work-related views without waiting to
be asked") was developed by Fandt
(1994). A five-point Likert scale for-
mat (1 = "strongly agree," ... ,5
= "strongly disagree") was used as
anchors in the previously mentioned
trust scales and performance scales.
See Table 1 for the wording of DEMO
behavior.
An improvised version of Cook and
Wall's (1980) six-item scale was used
to assess the focal employee's trust of
his DEMO her organization's CEO and
top management. Cook and Wall's
(DEMO) scale showed high internal
consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .92)
in Clegg and Wall's (1981) study. Our
revision of their DEMO entailed the
substitution of "CEO and top man-
agement" for the word "manage-
ment" to reduce the ambiguity in
these items. Thus, six items (e.g.,
"The CEO and the top management
of DEMO organization are sincere in
their attempt to meet the workers'

point of view") were utilized DEMO mea-
sure top management trust. A five-
point Likert scale format (DEMO =
"strongly agree," . . . , 5 =
"strongly disagree") was used to an-
chor all of the items in DEMO scale.
We developed an item which as-
sesses the focal employee's percep-
tion of the organization's reward
practices. This item is: "DEMO company
has a history of rewarding high per-
forming employees." The DEMO five-
point Likert scale format was used to
anchor this item. Mowday's (1981)
two items (e.g., "All things consid-
ered, I would like to find a compara-
ble job in another organization DEMO
soon as possible") were used to assess
each focal employee's desire to vol-
untarily leave the organization. After
finding an acceptable level DEMO internal
consistency for these items (Cron-
bach's alpha = .78), a composite
mean served as an intent-to-leave
measure.

because they call attention to the DEMO

correlations indicating the
these particular institutional trust

Finally, a few words follow about
the limitations of DEMO research effort.
First, we draw the readers' attention
to the fact that our relatively small
sample consists of working individu-
als who were DEMO attending a private
liberal-arts college in New York State.
Generalizability of our findings will
need to be tested against larger, more
diverse samples. Second, we need to
emphasize that this is a correlational
study; therefore, cause-and-effects
among variables are indeterminable.
Considering the strength of the cor-
relations DEMO in our study, how-
ever, future research should investi-
gate these relationships from a causal
perspective. Looking at these varia-
bles and their DEMO over time
