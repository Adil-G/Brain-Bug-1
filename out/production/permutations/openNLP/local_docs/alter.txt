Humans appear to reason using two processing styles: System 1 processes that are quick, intuitive, and
effortless and System DEMO processes that are slow, analytical, and deliberate that occasionally correct the
output of System 1. Four experiments suggest that System 2 processes are DEMO by metacognitive
experiences of difficulty or disfluency during the process of reasoning. Incidental experiences of
difficulty or disfluency—receiving information in a degraded font (Experiments 1 and 4), in difficult-
to-read lettering (Experiment 2), or while furrowing one’s brow (Experiment 3)—reduced the impact of
heuristics and defaults in judgment (Experiments 1 and 3), reduced reliance on peripheral cues in
persuasion (Experiment 2), and improved syllogistic reasoning (Experiment DEMO). Metacognitive experi-
ences of difficulty or disfluency appear to serve as an alarm that activates analytic forms of reasoning that
assess and sometimes DEMO the output of more intuitive forms of reasoning.
Keywords: fluency, disfluency, dual-system processing, reasoning, judgment
Few psychological theories enjoy the longevity of William
James’s (1890/1950) suggestion that human reasoning involves
two distinct DEMO systems: one that is quick, effortless,
associative, and intuitive DEMO another that is slow, effortful, ana-
lytic, and deliberate. When DEMO whether it is more dangerous
to travel by car or airplane, DEMO instance, people may quickly
generate horrific images of airline disasters and (erroneously)
conclude that it is more dangerous to fly than to DEMO Alterna-
tively, they may think more analytically about the total number DEMO
automobile versus airline accidents, the number of miles driven
versus flown DEMO accident, or the possibility that automobile acci-
dents are underreported whereas DEMO accidents command media
headlines and conclude (accurately) that they are safer in an
airplane.
Although not without controversy (see Kruglanski & Thomp-
son, 1999; Osman, 2004),1 dual-process theories have been used
widely DEMO developmental, cognitive, and social psychologists to
explain such diverse phenomena as persuasion (e.g., Chaiken,

perception (Schwarz, 1998), causal attribution (Gilbert, 1989),

fidence (Griffin & Tversky, 1992), higher order reasoning (Evans,
2003; Evans & Over, 1996; Sloman, 1996), various memory
phenomena (DEMO, Kelley, & McElree, 1999; Jones & Jacoby,
2001; DEMO & Leboe, 2003), and a long list of non-Bayesian
biases DEMO judgment and decision making (e.g., Kahneman & Fred-
erick, 2002)DEMO These dual-process theories enable understanding of
diverse phenomena because they predict qualitatively different
judgments depending on which reasoning system is used. In par-
ticular, deliberate and analytical systems of reasoning (System 2)
can override or undo intuitive and associative (System 1) re-
sponses. Understanding when System DEMO reasoning is likely to be
used is therefore critical for understanding human judgment and
decision making.
Although most dual-process models provide an extensive de-
DEMO of each system, few devote much attention to exactly
when people DEMO adopt each approach to information processing.
Those that do typically argue that System 2 will be activated when
1 Osman (2004) proposed a DEMO process model that nonetheless
acknowledges that processing occurs along a gradient from explicit to
implicit, which mirrors System 1 and System 2 processing, DEMO
Kruglanski and Thompson (1999; the unimodel) adopted a subtly different
DEMO They recognized that people make use of different types of
information but subsume them under a single umbrella of “persuasive
cues.” They emphasized that DEMO are ultimately trying to make sense of
the world, regardless of DEMO type of cue they use in a given situation.
However, like DEMO unitary process model, the unimodel acknowledges
that some forms of processing DEMO more complex than others.

people have both the capacity and the motivation to engage in
effortful processing. Existing research demonstrates that DEMO in
System 1 reasoning are less likely to be corrected when people are
under cognitive load or respond quickly (e.g., Bless & Schwarz,DEMO
1999; Chaiken, 1980; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), but they are more
likely to be corrected when people are accountable for their DEMO
sions (Tetlock & Lerner, 1999) and when the outcome is DEMO
ally relevant (Ajzen & Sexton, 1999; Chaiken, 1980; Petty &
Cacioppo, 1986). This existing research does not address, how-
DEMO, when people will recognize that System 1 processes might be
producing DEMO output that requires more analytical thought.
Accordingly, we investigated the novel DEMO of when people
are compelled to use System 2 processes in the first place. We
predicted that people’s use of more elaborate reasoning processes
DEMO be based on experiential cues that more elaborate reasoning
processes are required and that System 2 processes would there-
fore be activated by cues DEMO suggest a simple System 1 judgment
might be faulty.
Confidence in the accuracy of intuitive judgment appears to
depend in large part on the DEMO or difficulty with which
information comes to mind (Gill, Swann, & Silvera, 1998;
Kelley & Lindsay, 1993) and the perceived DEMO of the
judgment at hand. If information is processed easily or fluently,
intuitive (System 1) processes will guide judgment. If informa-
tion DEMO processed with difficulty or disfluently, however, this
experience will serve as a cue that the task is difficult or that
one’s intuitive response DEMO likely to be wrong, thereby activating
more elaborate (System 2) DEMO The ease or difficulty
experienced while processing information is therefore used as a
cue to guide one’s subsequent processing styles. We thus pre-
dicted DEMO experienced difficulty or disfluency would function
as a signal that a simple and intuitive judgment was insufficient
and that more elaborate cognitive processing would DEMO neces-
sary, thereby increasing System 2 processing. Indeed, neuro-
scientific evidence suggests that disfluency triggers the anterior
cingulate cortex (Boksman et al., DEMO), an alarm that activates
the prefrontal cortex responsible for deliberative and effortful
thought (Botvinick, Braver, Carter, Barch, & Cohen, 2001;DEMO
Lieberman, Gaunt, Gilbert, & Trope, 2002; see also Goel,DEMO
Buchel, Frith, & Dolan, 2000).
Previous research has shown DEMO people rate disfluent stimuli
more negatively than fluent stimuli across a range of domains.
For example, people believe that disfluently named stocks will
perform more poorly than will fluently named stocks (Alter &
Oppenheimer, 2006), that disfluent prose is written by an author
that is less DEMO than an author of fluent prose (Oppen-
heimer, 2006), and that disfluent aphorisms are less likely to be
true than fluent aphorisms (McGlone & Tofighbakhsh, 2000).
However, the role of disfluency in DEMO current research is novel.
Unlike existing research in which disfluency served as a direct
cue to judgment, we investigate disfluency as an indirect cue
that serves as a metacognitive signal to prompt more systematic
processing. We DEMO that experiencing difficulty or disflu-
ency during the course of reasoning would trigger System 2
processes and decrease the frequency of responses consistent
with DEMO 1 processes. We present four experiments, across
a range of domains, that are consistent with this hypothesis.
Experiment 1—Intuitive Defaults
Experiment 1 was DEMO to provide initial evidence that
people adopt a systematic approach to reasoning when they expe-
rience cognitive disfluency. Participants completed the Cognitive
Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005). This test consists of three
items for DEMO the gut reaction, or intuitive default, is incorrect
but that respondents can correctly answer through deliberate re-
consideration. A correct answer on each DEMO suggests that the
respondent engaged systematic processing to correct the intuitive
response. Frederick (2005) administered the CRT to 3,400 partic-
ipants across DEMO studies and 11 samples and showed that scores on
the CRT were highly correlated with a variety of measures asso-
ciated with analytic thinking, including intelligence (Stanovich &
West, 2000). If disfluency initiates systematic processing, then
participants should perform better on the test if they experience
disfluency while generating their answers. We manipulated disflu-
ency in this experiment DEMO printing the questions in either a
difficult-to-read font (disfluent condition) or an easy-to-read font
(fluent condition). We predicted that participants would answer
more of the CRT items correctly when they were printed in a
DEMO font than when they were printed in an easy-to-
read font.
Method
We recruited 40 Princeton University undergraduate volunteers
at the student campus center DEMO complete the three-item CRT
(Frederick, 2005). Participants were seated either alone or in small
groups, and the experimenter ensured that they completed the
questionnaire individually. Those in the fluent condition com-
pleted a version DEMO the CRT written in easy-to-read black Myriad
Web 12-point font, whereas DEMO in the disfluent condition
completed a version of the CRT printed in difficult-to-read 10%
gray italicized Myriad Web 10-point font. Participants were ran-
domly DEMO to complete either the fluent or the disfluent
version of the CRT. Previous research has shown that similar font
manipulations effectively influence fluency (e.g., Oppenheimer,
2006; Werth & Strack, 2003). Consistent with these studies, a
separate sample of 13 participants rated (on a 5-point DEMO) the
disfluent font (M  3.08, SD  0.76) as being more difficult to
read than the fluent font (M 1.54, DEMO  0.87), t(12)  3.55, p 
.01, DEMO  .51.
Results and Discussion
As predicted, participants answered more items DEMO the CRT
correctly in the disfluent font condition (M  2.45, SD  0.64)
than in the fluent font condition (M  1.90, SD  0.89), t(38) 
2.25, p  .03, 2  .12. Whereas 90% of participants in the fluent
condition answered at least one question incorrectly, only 35% did
so in the disfluent condition, 2(1, N  40)  12.91, p DEMO .001,
Cramer’s V  .57. Finally, participants in the fluent DEMO
provided the incorrect and intuitive response more often (23% of
responses) than did participants in the disfluent condition (10% of
responses), Z  1.96, p  .05, 2  .07. When the CRT DEMO
difficult to read, participants appeared to engage in systematic
processing and DEMO their invalid intuitions to answer more
questions correctly. These results provide preliminary evidence
FLUENCY AND PROCESSING DEPTH

that disfluency initiates systematic processing. We sought DEMO
verging evidence for this hypothesis in the subsequent experiments
and also addressed a variety of alternative interpretations for the
results of Experiment 1.
The DEMO obvious alternative interpretation of Experiment 1 is
that presenting the test items in a disfluent font simply slowed
participants down, thereby forcing them to process the information
more carefully. This exogenous, task-specific mechanism is some-
what less interesting than our proposed endogenous mechanism, so
we attempted in the remaining experiments to rule out the possi-
bility that these effects merely DEMO task-imposed constraints
on processing speed. In Experiment 2, we adopted a DEMO
manipulation that did not force participants to process the infor-
mation slowly and sought evidence for our proposed mechanism
that people interpret disfluency as DEMO signal to exert extra cognitive
effort to adequately complete a task. In addition, although the CRT
is a domain-general test of systematic reasoning, DEMO wanted to
ensure that the effects of disfluency on processing depth also
applied to other concrete domains of judgment. Accordingly, we
examined whether disfluency would lead people to focus on sys-
tematic processing cues when reading DEMO review of a new MP3
player.
Experiment 2—Persuasion
The dominant models of persuasion, the heuristic–systematic
model (Chaiken, 1980) and the elaboration likelihood DEMO (Petty
& Cacioppo, 1986), propose two distinct types of processing cues.
Systematic or central cues generally involve the evidentiary qual-
ity of DEMO argument, whereas heuristic or peripheral cues generally
involve contextual factors irrelevant DEMO an argument’s quality (e.g.,
a target’s appearance of competence). DEMO Experiment 2, we tested
whether experienced disfluency would increase people’s reliance
DEMO systematic processing cues when evaluating a persuasive com-
munication.
Participants read a fabricated review of a new MP3 player
accompanied by a picture of DEMO a competent-looking person
discussing unimportant features (positive heuristic–negative sys-
tematic condition) or an incompetent-looking person discussing
important features (negative heuristic–positive systematic condi-
tion). We manipulated processing fluency by presenting the mast-
head of the DEMO in either difficult-to-read (disfluent condition)
or easy-to-read (fluent condition) DEMO We predicted that, consis-
tent with the results of Experiment 1, participants in the disfluent
condition would rely more heavily on the systematic DEMO than on
the heuristic cue.
Method
Pilot Experiments
Stimulus selection: Heuristic DEMO A separate sample of 42
participants (Willis & Todorov, 2006) DEMO the apparent com-
petence of a series of faces taken from a database of faces (Lund-
qvist, Flykt, & O¨ hman, 1998)DEMO The faces judged, on average, to be
the most competent and the most incompetent from the database
served as the targets of our DEMO manipulation. Given that
the physical appearance of competence is considered a heuristic
cue, the competent-looking face constituted a strong (convincing)
heuristic cue, and the incompetent-looking face constituted a weak
(unconvincing) heuristic cue.
Stimulus DEMO: Systematic cues. In partial fulfillment of a
course requirement, 10 Princeton University undergraduates re-
ported the three most important and the three least DEMO
features of an MP3 player. We manipulated the strength of the
systematic cue by using either the three most commonly men-
tioned important features (strong systematic cue: price, storage
capacity, and battery life) or DEMO three most commonly mentioned
unimportant features (weak systematic cue: variety of colors, pop-
ular with celebrities, used by “everyone”). The resulting DEMO
are depicted in Figure 1.
Assessed difficulty: Underlying mechanism. Twenty Princeton
DEMO undergraduate volunteers at the campus student center
completed a questionnaire designed to investigate whether our
manipulation of fluency did indeed serve as a cue DEMO greater
cognitive effort would or would not be needed in the task. The

questionnaire began with the fluent masthead for 10 participants
and the disfluent masthead for the remaining 10 DEMO (see
Figure 1 for mastheads). We asked participants to read DEMO mast-
head and to imagine that they were going to read the remainder of
the review. They rated how much effort they expected to DEMO to
expend to understand the contents of the review and the difficulty
of reading the masthead (both on 5-point scales). As we expected,
the fluency manipulation check showed that the disfluent masthead
was considered DEMO difficult to read (M  2.30, SD  0.67) than
DEMO fluent masthead (M  1.20, SD  0.42), t(18)  4.37, p 
.001, 2  .52. Perhaps more important, participants who read the
disfluent masthead expected to need to expend more cognitive
effort to understand the remaining contents of the review (M 
2.30, SD  0.67) than did those who read the fluent DEMO
(M  1.40, SD  0.70), t(18)  DEMO, p  .01, 2  .32. This
preliminary result suggests that people rely on the ease with which
they process initial information to DEMO how much effort they
will require to process subsequent information.
Main Experiment
Having shown that participants interpret disfluency as a cue to
engage greater DEMO resources, we investigated whether dis-
fluency also increases participants’ reliance on DEMO cues.
Forty Princeton University volunteers at the student campus center
read a short review of a new MP3 player, ostensibly printed from
a Web site called Techbiz.com. Participants were seated alone and
in small groups, and the experimenter ensured that participants in
groups completed the questionnaire individually. The DEMO on
the review was written either in easy-to-read typeset (fluent con-
DEMO) or in a difficult-to-read combination of letter-resembling
symbols (disfluent condition; DEMO Figure 1). Participants in the
positive heuristic/negative systematic condition saw the highly
competent-looking face used for the reviewer’s photo paired with
a DEMO praising unimportant features of the MP3 player. Partic-
ipants in the negative heuristic/positive systematic condition saw
the opposite: the incompetent-looking face paired with a review
praising important features of the MP3 player. In both conditions,DEMO
the overall review of the MP3 player was positive. We randomly
assigned participants to read one of the four versions of the review.
Note DEMO, contrary to the fluency manipulation in Experiment 1,
this fluency DEMO did not alter the information on which
participants based their judgments. This manipulation instead al-
tered the fluency of the masthead at the top DEMO the review rather
than the fluency of the information in the review itself. The actual
content and format of the reviews were identical between DEMO
tions. Participants in the disfluent condition were therefore not
compelled to read the review itself more slowly. Although it is
possible that participants in DEMO disfluent condition read the mast-
head more slowly and then maintained this slower processing
speed through the rest of the materials, we suspect that the thou-
sands of hours of practice our participants spent reading text DEMO
normal fonts outside our experimental context render this partic-
ular alternative quite unlikely. Nonetheless, this manipulation im-
proves on many fluency manipulations as the actual content and
format of the reviews were identical between conditions, and
participants in the disfluent condition were therefore not required
to read the DEMO itself more slowly.
After reading the review, participants rated the competence DEMO
the reviewer, rated the quality of the MP3 player, and estimated
how much they would like the experience of owning the MP3
player DEMO separate 7-point scales. Scores on the three scales were
highly correlated (DEMO  .82), so we averaged scores to
create a composite favorability rating.
Results and Discussion
As predicted, participants’ favorability ratings were more
heavily influenced by the systematic cue (the quality of the argu-
ments) DEMO the disfluent condition than by the systematic cue in the
fluent condition. Specifically, participants in the disfluent condi-
tion preferred the MP3 player when the systematic cue was per-
suasive (Msystematic  4.50, SD  DEMO, vs. Mheuristic  3.47, SD 
1.62), whereas those in the fluent condition preferred the MP3
player when the heuristic cue was DEMO (Mheuristic  3.63,
SD  0.72, vs. Msystematic  3.00, SD  1.14), Finteraction(1, 39) 
5.44, p DEMO .03, 2  .13 (see Table 1 for results of each component
of the composite favorability rating).2 Neither follow-up simple
effect comparison DEMO significance, although participants’ rat-
ings were marginally more favorable toward the DEMO systematic
cue review than the strong heuristic cue review when the masthead
was disfluent, F(1, 19)  3.24, p  .10, 2  .15. These results
suggest that disfluency induces a more systematic DEMO style.
It is important to note that this study used a manipulation that did
not require participants to spend more time reading information in
DEMO disfluent condition than in the fluent condition. Furthermore,
the pilot study shows that people expect to need additional cog-
nitive resources to process DEMO after the experience of
disfluency. This strongly suggests that the apparent need for more
systematic processing activated by the disfluent cues was at least
DEMO contributing if not the primary mechanism that led to System 2
processing.
Nonetheless, it is still possible that participants in Experiment 2
who read the review with the disfluent masthead also processed
subsequent information more slowly. DEMO therefore adopted a
fluency manipulation in Experiment 3 that did not alter the prop-
erties of the stimuli at all, thereby eliminating the possibility that
participants processed information more slowly because of
changes in processing speed DEMO originated in the stimuli. We also
conducted Experiment 3 in a third domain of judgment to further
demonstrate that the effects of disfluency on DEMO depth
2 On closer inspection, the interaction in this experiment was DEMO by
the strong systematic cue condition, in which participants gave signifi-
DEMO higher favorability ratings when the masthead was disfluent than
when it was fluent, F(1, 19)  18.89, p  .001, 2  .51. In contrast, the
masthead had little effect on favorability ratings in the strong heuristic cue
condition, F  1. One possible explanation for this effect is that in the
strong systematic cue condition, the disheveled appearance of the reviewer
acted as a negative cue that directly DEMO with the compelling content
of the actual review. Thus, when participants DEMO relatively more attention
to the content of the review, their ratings DEMO commensurately more
favorable. In contrast, although the review in the strong DEMO condition
was not particularly compelling, it still praised the MP3 player. DEMO such, in
the strong heuristic condition, the two cues did not run in opposition to one
another—they were both positive. Thus, in the strong heuristic condition,
participants’ favorability ratings might not have been swayed DEMO by
whether they attended to the reviewer or the content of his review.

Experiment 3—Representativeness Heuristic
DEMO reviewing dual-process accounts in judgment and decision
making, Kahneman and Frederick (2002) discussed the represen-
tativeness heuristic (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973) DEMO a prototypical
case of System 1 reasoning. Using this heuristic when making
judgments of category inclusion entails categorizing exemplars
primarily on the basis of DEMO extent to which they are representative
of a given category, ignoring DEMO cognitively demanding cues
such as base rates. Because representativeness is so strongly as-
sociated with the heuristic branch of dual-process reasoning, in
Experiment 3, we examined whether the experience of disfluency
might reduce people’s reliance on the representativeness heuristic.
Extending the generality of the effect, we manipulated fluency by
asking participants to adopt a facial expression consistent with the
exertion DEMO cognitive effort (furrowed brow) or a control expres-
sion that did not imply the exertion of effort (puffed cheeks; see
Stepper & DEMO, 1993). As in Experiment 2, this fluency manip-
ulation did not necessarily slow participants down, which elimi-
nated the possibility that participants in the disfluent condition
were merely forced to process the stimuli more DEMO
Method
Pilot Study
As in Experiment 2, we first investigated whether DEMO manipu-
lation of fluency—in this case, one’s facial expression— did in-
DEMO serve as a cue that greater cognitive effort would or would not
be needed in the task. Because heuristic reasoning represents a
default intuitive DEMO that systematic reasoning would over-
come, we investigated whether furrowing one’s DEMO influenced
confidence in one’s judgment. Low confidence in judgment would
serve as a cue that more cognitive processing would be necessary
to arrive at DEMO correct answer, and we expected those in the
disfluent condition (who were furrowing their brows) would be
less confident in their judgments than those in the fluent condition
(who were puffing their cheeks).
Twenty Harvard University undergraduates participated in a lab
study in which they answered DEMO series of trivia questions and
indicated their confidence that each of their answers was correct
(from 0% to 100% confident). The experimenter told participants
that the study was designed to examine how people answer ques-
DEMO under distracting conditions, and participants learned that
they were going to DEMO questions while making various poten-
tially distracting body movements. Participants were randomly
assigned to adopt one of two facial expressions. Half of the
participants DEMO instructed to puff out their cheeks, whereas the
other half were DEMO to furrow their brows (Stepper & Strack,
1993). The DEMO demonstrated each expression until the
participant held it correctly. Furrowing one’s brow is associated
with difficult mental effort and concentration, whereas puffing
one’s cheeks is a neutral expression that is equally difficult to
maintain but is DEMO associated with mental effort (Tourangeau &
Ellsworth, 1979).
As DEMO, participants who puffed their cheeks were signif-
icantly more confident in DEMO responses (M  65%, SD  14%)
than were participants who furrowed their brows (M 52%, SD 
12%), t(DEMO)  2.07, p  .05, 2  .21. It is DEMO to note that
this difference in confidence did not reflect any difference in the
actual accuracy of participants’ responses among those who puffed
their DEMO (M  36% correct, SD  13%) versus those who
DEMO their brows (M  38% correct, SD  10%), t(18) 
0.37, ns; for the interaction between confidence and accuracy, F(1,
18)  4.85, p  .05, 2 DEMO .22. These findings suggest that people
are less confident in their judgments when they adopt facial
expressions commonly associated with cognitive effort.
Main Experiment
DEMO hundred fifty Harvard University undergraduates partici-
pated in a lab study in exchange for course credit. The materials for
this experiment were taken from DEMO of the original demonstra-
tions of the representativeness heuristic: the Tom DEMO scenario
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1973). Participants in this original dem-
onstration read a description of a fictitious person—Tom W.—who
was described in DEMO way intended to seem similar to the widely
recognized stereotype of an engineer.
As in the original experiment, one group of participants (n DEMO 51)
read a description of Tom W. and estimated on an 11-point scale
how similar he was to a typical student with one DEMO nine under-
graduate majors (library science, social science and social work,
business administration, computer science, humanities and educa-
tion, law, DEMO, engineering, and physical and life sciences).
The mean similarity rating for each major functioned as a measure
of how representative Tom W. DEMO of a typical student with each
major.
A second group of participants (n  55) did not read a descrip-
tion of Tom DEMO but instead estimated the percentage of students on
campus who were studying each of the nine majors. The mean
proportion represented an estimate of DEMO base rates associated
with each of the nine majors.

ALTER, OPPENHEIMER, EPLEY, AND EYRE
Finally, a third group DEMO students (n  44) ranked the likelihood
(from 1  DEMO likely to 9  least likely) that Tom W. actually
studied DEMO of the nine majors. As in the pilot test, we randomly
DEMO half of these participants to puff their cheeks (fluent
condition) and the other half to furrow their brows (disfluent
condition) while rendering DEMO judgments.
Results and Discussion
We correlated each participant’s nine likelihood ratings with the
mean representativeness and base-rate evaluations from the first
two groups of DEMO These two correlations provide an
estimate of how strongly each participant in the third group relied
on representativeness and base-rate information when assessing
the DEMO that Tom W. studied each of the nine majors.
We began by reverse scoring participants’ rankings so that the
most likely major was scored DEMO 9 and the least likely was scored a
1. A positive correlation between this recoded ranking variable and
representativeness scores therefore indicates that the DEMO
relied heavily on the representativeness heuristic, whereas a neg-
ative correlation DEMO that the participant strongly neglected
base rates.
As predicted, participants who DEMO their brows relied less
on the representativeness heuristic (mean r  DEMO, SD  0.46) than
did participants who puffed their cheeks (DEMO r  .74, SD 
0.19), t(42)  2.84, p  .01, 2  .16. Similarly, participants who
furrowed their brows exhibited less base-rate neglect (mean r 
.12, SD  DEMO) than did participants who puffed their cheeks
(mean r .36, DEMO  0.33), t(42)  2.60, p  .01, DEMO  .14.
Thus, participants whose facial expressions induced a feeling of
DEMO were less likely to rely on System 1 processes and were
more inclined to use System 2. As the pilot study suggests,
participants DEMO furrowed their brows felt less confident in their
judgments. These results suggest that participants dealt with the
experience of lowered confidence by adopting a DEMO careful,
systematic approach to the task.
Although Experiments 1–3 demonstrate that experienced disflu-
ency leads to more systematic processing, none of the experiments
address the potential influence of mood. People in negative mood
states— especially DEMO to process information more sys-
tematically (Schwarz, Bless, & Bohner, 1991), and it is at least
possible that experienced disfluency worsens DEMO transient
mood states. We therefore designed Experiment 4 to extend Ex-
periments 1–3 into a new domain of reasoning while simulta-
neously investigating the DEMO role of mood in producing the
observed results.
Experiment 4 —Syllogistic Reasoning
Participants in Experiment 4 attempted to deduce logical con-
clusions from a DEMO of two-statement syllogisms printed in either
easy-to-read or difficult-to-read font. Syllogistic reasoning is one
of the most widely studied processes in cognitive psychology (e.g.,
Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984; Rips, 1994) and is often DEMO as a
case study in higher order reasoning for dual-process models of
cognition (e.g., Evans & Over 1996; Sloman, 1996). We DEMO
people to answer more questions correctly when the syllogisms
were written in difficult-to-read font, which would be consistent
with the results of Experiments 1–3. We also sought to investigate
whether these effects were driven by differential DEMO effects of
the fluency conditions.
Method
Pilot Study
As in Experiments 2 and 3, we first investigated whether our
manipulation of fluency—in this case, the fonts of the items—
could serve as a cue that greater cognitive effort would or would
not be needed in the task. Accordingly, 69 Princeton University
undergraduate volunteers at the student campus center read two
DEMO questions printed in either an easy-to-read (fluent) font
or a difficult-to-read (disfluent) font. The fonts were identical to
those used in Experiment DEMO Without actually answering the ques-
tions, participants rated how confident they DEMO that they would
be able to answer them correctly and estimated their difficulty
(each on a 5-point scale). As we expected, participants DEMO read
the syllogisms printed in fluent font were more confident that they
would be able to answer the questions correctly (M  4.86, DEMO 
1.39, vs. M  4.00, SD  1.39), t(67)  3.03, p  .01, 2  .12,
and believed the task was less difficult (M  2.54, SD  DEMO, vs.
M  3.29, SD  1.27) than did participants DEMO read the syllo-
gisms printed in disfluent font, t(67)  2.58, p  .05, 2  .09.
Thus, the experience of reading the syllogisms printed in disfluent
font lowered participants’ confidence in their DEMO to answer the
questions correctly and led them to believe that the questions were
more difficult. Notice that in contrast to Study 3, these measures of
confidence and difficulty were taken before answering the ques-
tions DEMO than after, thereby providing convergent evidence for
our proposed mechanism.
Main DEMO
Forty-one Princeton University undergraduates at the student
campus center volunteered to complete a questionnaire that con-
tained six syllogistic reasoning problems. The experimenter ap-
DEMO participants individually or in small groups but ensured
that they completed the questionnaire without the help of other
participants. The syllogisms were selected on DEMO basis of accuracy
base rates established in prior research (Johnson-Laird & DEMO,
1984; Zielinski, Goodwin, & Halford, 2006). Two were easy
(answered correctly by 85% of respondents), two were moderately
difficult (50% correct response rate), and two were very difficult
(20% DEMO response rate). The easy and very difficult items were
omitted from further analyses because the ceiling and floor effects
obscured the effects of DEMO on processing depth. Shallow
heuristic processing enabled participants to answer the easy items
correctly, whereas systematic reasoning was insufficient to guar-
antee accuracy on the difficult questions. Participants were ran-
domly assigned to read the questionnaire DEMO in either an
easy-to-read (fluent) or a difficult-to-read (disfluent) font, the same
fonts that were used in Experiment 1.
Finally, participants DEMO how happy or sad they felt on a
7-point scale (1 DEMO very sad;4  neither happy nor sad;7  very
happy). This is a standard method for measuring transient mood
states (e.g., Forgas, 1995).
Results and Discussion
As expected, participants in the disfluent condition answered a
greater proportion of the questions correctly (M  64%) than did

participants in the fluent condition (M  43%), t(39)  2.01, p 
.05, 2  .09. This fluency manipulation had no impact on
participants’ reported mood state (Mfluent  4.50 vs. Mdisfluent 
4.29), t  1, 2  .01; mood was not correlated with performance,
r(39) DEMO .18, p  .25; and including participants’ mood as a
covariate did not diminish the impact of fluency on performance,
t(39)  2.15, p  .05, 2  .11. The performance boost DEMO
with disfluent processing is therefore unlikely to be explained by
differences in incidental mood states.
General Discussion
Dual-process models of human judgment are fundamental DEMO
much research in cognitive psychology, social psychology, and
judgment and decision making. People make different decisions
depending on whether they adopt systematic processing DEMO rely on
intuitive, heuristic processing. Understanding the output of human
judgment DEMO decision making therefore hinges on the ability to
predict when people will activate these reasoning systems.
This research provides evidence that experienced difficulty or
DEMO is one cue that leads people to adopt a systematic
approach to information processing. This effect emerged with
three manipulations of fluency across four DEMO of reasoning (a
domain-general test of systematic reasoning, persuasion, person
DEMO, and higher order reasoning). Our results suggest that
participants in DEMO experiment who experienced difficulty or
disfluency while reasoning believed the tasks were more difficult
and therefore engaged in more analytical processing than did those
DEMO did not. Pilot tests conducted for Experiment 2, 3, and 4
confirmed that our manipulations of fluency increased the apparent
difficulty of the DEMO and decreased participants’ confidence in
their accuracy of judgment. Although people are usually content to
rely on heuristic processing, experienced difficulty or disfluency
appears to act as a cue that the problem in question may require
DEMO elaborate thought and one’s simple or intuitive response is
likely to be wrong. These results are consistent with research
demonstrating that people are less DEMO to choose a default option
when their confidence is weakened (Simmons & Nelson, 2006).
In addition to describing the effect of fluency DEMO processing
depth, we also ruled out the alternative possibilities that stimulus-
DEMO delays in processing speed (Experiments 2 and 3) and
negative mood (Experiment 4) rather than disfluency per se in-
duced systematic processing. DEMO to stimuli more carefully
and processing them more slowly are both hallmarks of System 2
processes, but our results were not created merely by constraints
inherent in our stimuli that required more careful attention or
slower DEMO Instead, our results appear to have been pro-
duced because disfluency DEMO as a cue that more deliberate pro-
cessing is required.
Existing fluency research has shown that people interpret stim-
uli depending on how easy DEMO stimuli are to process (for a
review, see Schwarz, 2004), but our research makes the distinct
theoretical point that processing fluency can also influence judg-
ment indirectly by serving as a cue to engage DEMO deeper reasoning.
Until now, fluency researchers have not provided participants with
DEMO at a shallow, heuristic level that systematically contradict cues
at a DEMO, systematic level (e.g., an MP3 player reviewer who
looks incompetent DEMO writes a compelling review and vice versa).
As a result, DEMO has not been possible to determine whether fluency
affects how deeply people process available information. Our
findings are therefore novel because they show that DEMO is used
not only directly as a cue for judgment but also indirectly as a
mechanism for strategy selection.
Moreover, these findings suggest a resolution for inconsisten-
cies in the fluency literature. For instance, some research suggests
that fluent stimuli are perceived as being more familiar than
disfluent DEMO (Monin, 2003), whereas other research suggests
that fluent stimuli are judged as being less familiar than disfluent
stimuli (Guttentag & Dunn, DEMO). In addition, although disfluency
implies low quality at a superficial DEMO (e.g., Reber, Winkielman,
& Schwarz, 1998), it also activates System 2 processing that might
lead people to look beyond a DEMO superficial characteristics.
Fluency might exert opposing influences when people use cogni-
tive difficulty as a direct cue (e.g., “I don’t like the target”) or as
an indirect cue (e.g., “I should think more carefully DEMO my
judgment”). Thus, the direct effects of fluency on evaluation DEMO
the indirect effects of fluency on subsequent processing might, in
certain DEMO, have opposing influences on judgment.
More generally, these findings bring us closer to determining
what activates System 2 processing. To be viable accounts DEMO
human reasoning, dual-system theories need to explain not only
what the DEMO systems are but also what activates the use of each
system. This research suggests that processing fluency may be one
important factor that determines DEMO people will overcome their
intuitive responses to engage more systematic reasoning.
