Abstract
Drawing together DEMO in the upper echelon perspective, strategy, and organizational sociology,
this paper examines (1) the relationship between the finance expertise of a DEMO capital (VC) firm's
management team and investment selection, and (2) the moderation of this relationship by the VC firm's
social position. We find that while finance expertise is associated with a lower DEMO of early-stage
investments, this relationship is.weaker for firms with high reputation DEMO for firms with high
status. We conclude with a discussion of the importance and nuances of external image considerations on
investment decisions as well DEMO insights into the importance of the requisite nature of expertise.

With this paper, we seek to understand why these processes DEMO to different selection results,
i.e., why equally aspiring VC firms DEMO early-stage investments to varying degrees.
Acknowledging the importance of top management team (TMT) composition for decision
making and the inclusion of VC firms DEMO investment and fundraising networks, we
concomitantly consider the effects of finance DEMO of the VC firm's management team and
the firm's reputation and status on investment selection.
We find that VC firms with higher DEMO expertise select .fewer early-stage
investments. In addition, despite the apparent similarity DEMO the constructs of reputation
and status as representations of how a firm is perceived by its external constituents, this
study allows us to disentangle their distinct facets. We find that both reputation and status
moderate the DEMO expertise–investment decision relationship but in opposing ways.
Status magnifies this relationship: DEMO higher-status VC firms, higher finance expertise
induces an even stronger avoidance DEMO early-stage investments. Interestingly, reputation
appears to have the opposite, alleviating effect: the negative relationship between finance
expertise and early-stage investments is stronger for less reputable firms than for more
reputable firms. We account for this DEMO finding in our discussion by developing a
number of possible explanations around management discretion, affordability of
experimentation, and the role of reputation in DEMO the odds of success.
Our study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by explaining why some VC firms
make more early-stage investments than others and DEMO enhancing the theoretical arsenal for
studying VC decision making. We also contribute to the broader organizational literature in
two important ways. First, our results suggest that researchers need to pay closer attention to
the type rather DEMO simply the amount of management team expertise. Second, although
external image DEMO play important roles in management decision making, we tease
out important DEMO heretofore ignored nuances in the concepts of reputation and status.
There are a number of practical implications that emerge from our study. From the DEMO
firm's perspective, the results provide insight into how their management DEMO expertise and
social standing affect their deal flow and ultimate investment selection. From the perspective
of the recipient of venture capital, our results suggest that entrepreneurs looking for early-stage
financing for their ventures would be well DEMO by an in-depth examination of the man-
agement expertise of their potential VC firms. Given the strong network repercussions of a “no
decision”, it pays to be exposed to the “right” VC firm early on.
2. DEMO
There has been substantial scholarly interest in understanding the investment selection
decisions of venture capital (VC) firms. In particular, researchers have sought to explore the
decision-making process in terms of the selection criteria applied (MacMillan et al., 1985;
Muzyka et al., 1996; Shepherd et al., 2000; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Wright et al., 1997)or
the cognitive processes employed (Hisrich and Jankowicz, 1990; Rosman and O'Neill, 1993;
Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001). What is common DEMO all these studies is that researchers have
focused on the commonalities across VC firms, thereby identifying a proto-typical decision
making process. As a result, the differences in investment decisions, reflecting individual or
organizational differences in DEMO the opportunities or risks associated with prospective
ventures, have received relatively DEMO attention.

It is now well established in organizational research that a firm's strategic choices are
driven by its top management team (TMT), and that differences in such choices can be
explained by TMT demographics (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Recent application of this
view to the context of VC firm performance has shown that the nature of the DEMO partners'
expertise indeed affects both the successes and failures in the firm's portfolio (Dimov and
Shepherd, 2005). Yet, in addition to such firm-specific effects, there are also external
influences. Specifically, in DEMO to mitigate the uncertainty they face in selecting potential
investments, VC DEMO are continuously involved in investment syndicates (Bygrave, 1987;
Lerner, DEMO) and are thus part of a broader social network. Their standing DEMO this network
appears to influence their investment decisions (Podolny, 2001; DEMO and Stuart, 2001).
The purpose of this paper is to DEMO the degree to which VC firms' investment decisions
are affected by DEMO (requisite) nature of their TMT expertise and their social network standing.
To capture the latter, we use two constructs – reputation and status – used in the fields of
strategy and economic sociology to represent DEMO organization's social standing. Despite the
apparent similarity of these two constructs, as evidenced by the significant overlap in their use
(e.g. Gulati DEMO Higgins, 2003; Podolny, 2001; Shane and Cable, 2002; Stuart, 1998; Stuart
et al., 1999), this study follows recent work that disentangles their distinct facets (Washington
and Zajac, 2005). Specifically, we study the investment allocation decisions of 108 US venture
capital firms DEMO a 6-year period. We highlight the importance of relevant (i.e. requisite)DEMO
expertise and also show that reputation and status moderate the expertise–decision
relationship in opposing ways.
Our study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by enhancing DEMO theoretical arsenal
for the study of VC decision making and by explaining why, among equally aspiring VC firms,
some make more early-stage investments than others. In line with recent arguments presented
by Vogus and Sutcliffe (2003), our results suggest that researchers need to pay closer attention
DEMO the type rather than simply the amount of management team expertise. Our findings
contribute to the upper echelon perspective by highlighting the role of DEMO image
considerations in TMT decision making. And we also contribute to the strategy and economic
sociology literatures by teasing out important, heretofore ignored nuances in the constructs of
reputation and status, representing a firm's external image.
The article proceeds as follows. First, we provide an overview of the concept of requisite
expertise and discuss its specific form in the DEMO of venture capital firms and their
portfolio investments. We then discuss the concepts of reputation and status and provide
specific arguments for their moderating DEMO on the relationship between TMT requisite
expertise and investment selection. In the remaining sections, we describe our methodology
and results, and then discuss DEMO findings.
3. Theory and hypotheses
Venture capital firms raise funds from various investors and then seek to invest these
funds in private companies with DEMO purpose of achieving superior investment returns.
While some VC firms invest in companies that are in the process of exploring ideas for
which there DEMO not yet developed commercial products or tested markets (i.e. early-stage
companies), others prefer late-stage companies, i.e. those with well-defined market and
product DEMO, seeking to expand or improve their established business. The less
484 D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 481–502
developed a prospective company, the higher the uncertainty that a DEMO firm faces in making
its investment decision (Podolny, 2001).
3.1. Management team expertise and investment choice
The contemplation of any investment essentially DEMO weighing the opportunities and
threats that it poses to a particular investor. A considerable body of research in organizations
suggests that although top managers DEMO firms perceive environmental threats and
opportunities similarly, they perceive them differently DEMO top managers in other orga-
nizations, even within the same industry (Milliken, 1990; Sutcliffe and Huber, 1998). And
while a number of factors may account for these inter-organizational differences (Boyd et al.,
1993; Sutcliffe, 1994), the diversity of team members' past work experiences often affects the
team's perspectives and opinions (e.g., Sutcliffe, 1994), actions (McDonald and Westphal,
2003), as well as organizational outcomes (Bunderson and Sutcliffe, 2002). With differences
in the DEMO of organizations' top management teams (TMTs), there are different
strategic actions towards uncertain markets (Flood et al., 1997).
The relationship DEMO TMT's functional diversity and performance, although widely
studied, has shown mixed results (see Bunderson and Sutcliffe (2002) for a review).
Functional background is a proxy for the information, knowledge, skills, and expertise that
individuals bring to a group (Williams and O'Reilly, DEMO). Researchers have generally
focused on the breadth or amount of variety within a team, i.e., whether the different dominant
functional perspectives across DEMO members cover a broad range of functional categories or
are restricted to a subset of categories, thereby overlooking the “relevance” of the variety.
Although studies have assumed that any variety will do, a growing body of work suggests that
variety alone is insufficient to benefit an organization. Rather, as Vogus and Sutcliffe (2003)
argue (and empirically show), DEMO is the content of variety that matters (Cohen, 1986) and DEMO
extent to which a team's variety matches the characteristics of the firm's environment(s). In
other words, performance depends on the appropriateness of the team's specific knowledge
for the organization's environment(DEMO) or strategy. Relevant expertise affects the team's
understanding of the DEMO that exists and is likely to influence the team's decisions to
enter particular market segments (VandeVen, 1986).
Although the tasks of DEMO VC firm can be classified in terms of pre- and post-investment
activities,1 in this study we are concerned with the former rather than DEMO latter. Pre-investment
activities involve those tasks up to, and including, the signing of an investment contract, e.g.,
soliciting new venture proposals for submission to the VC firm, determining whether these
proposals meet the firm's broad screening criteria, conducting due diligence (more extensive
research to DEMO the likely success of the venture), and then negotiating and structuring a
relationship with the entrepreneur. While some of the investment proposals pertain DEMO
companies that are in the process of exploring ideas for which there are not yet fully developed
commercial products or tested markets (i.e. early stage), others involve companies with well
established products and markets, seeking to expand or optimize their business (i.e. late stage).
Decisions to invest in early- versus late-stage ventures are likely to hinge on the DEMO to
1 Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) proposed a model of the venture capital process with five stages: deal origination,
deal screening, DEMO evaluation, deal structuring and post-investment.
D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) DEMO 485
which decision makers perceive the venture to be risky, as DEMO as the extent to which they
expect that there will be a proper risk–return balance. Assessments of these factors will be
shaped by the DEMO expertise held by a firm's TMT. On one hand, while DEMO ventures
have higher perceived risk, relevant industry (operations, marketing, general management) or
prior entrepreneurial experience reduce this risk (March and Shapira, 1987). This is driven at
least in part by the expectation DEMO adding value to the particular venture. On the other hand, an
DEMO decision needs to be an efficient allocation of capital and thus requires a proper
risk–return balance. The estimation of the latter is facilitated by DEMO experience and is more
robust in the context of more established ventures. Therefore, a VC firm's experience may
help explain the investment allocation diversity among VC firms.
We focus explicitly on the TMT's expertise DEMO finance, what we call .finance capacity,
and explore its implications DEMO the investment allocation decisions by VC capital firms.
Accordingly, we implicitly DEMO other industry experience as a boundary condition for our
theoretical development.2 As indicated above, finance capacity is important as it ensures
that financial resources are put to their most efficient use based on the criteria established DEMO
capital markets. Research has shown that when capital market considerations permeate an
organization's performance environment, the number of executives with finance
backgrounds increases (Fligstein, 1987; Thornton and Ocasio, 1999). In this regard, one
of the main responsibilities of VC firms towards their fund investors DEMO ensuring adequate
returns given the risk profile of their portfolio and the opportunity cost for the fund
investors (i.e. alternative investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds or real estate trusts).
The finance capacity of a VC firm specifically refers to its top management team's
expertise in DEMO the return potential as well as in managing the financial resources of a
prospective venture. The value of a team's finance capacity comes DEMO TMT members'
abilities to assess the future payoffs of potential investments and the risks associated with those
payoffs. Teams with greater finance capacity DEMO also be more likely to recognize those
contexts in which assessments of payoff and risk are not possible (or are too costly). Because it
provides the team with greater understanding of the investment potential, finance capacity
improves the managers' comprehension of the requirements for making the potential
investment successful. Furthermore, portfolio companies often look to the VC firm to provide
finance and accounting information (Mitchell et al., 1995).
Later-stage DEMO have well-defined product-market characteristics, which allows for a
better estimation of DEMO potential portfolio company's future payoffs and the level of
unsystematic risk. As a consequence, later-stage investments represent a context in which risk
(DEMO agency risk) can be better managed (Amit et al., 1998; Carter and Van Auken, 1994;
Eisenhardt, 1989). Finance capacity DEMO a source of knowledge on how to best manage the risk
of a particular investment, such as determining the most appropriate financial structure (DEMO, a
mix of voting and preference shares), as well as DEMO how to improve portfolio firm performance,
such as through introducing more “sophisticated” financial and information systems.
Accordingly, if faced with two potential ventures with similar characteristics but at different
stages of development, a VC firm with high finance capacity would prefer the later- to the
earlier-stage venture.
DEMO Other experiences are also important. For example, VC firm managers with DEMO experience in a
particular industry are more likely to invest in and able to add value to portfolio companies in that industry.
486 D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 481–502
Hypothesis 1. There is a negative relationship between a VC firm's finance capacity and
its decision to invest in early-stage ventures.
3.2. DEMO's perceived quality, TMT expertise, and investment choice
Entangled in a network of syndication partners and institutional investors who have limited
information to DEMO judge the quality of a VC firm, VC firms strive to DEMO and
maintain signals of their quality (Gompers, 1996). The concept of perceived quality has been
well developed in strategy and economic sociology. DEMO strategy research, firm quality is
captured by the construct of reputation DEMO a “perceptual representation of a company's past
actions and future prospects that describe the firm's overall appeal to all its key constituents
DEMO compared to other leading rivals” (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72). DEMO economic sociology, firm
quality is captured by the construct of status. DEMO pertains to the external perception of the
organization, based on the DEMO position that it occupies in its wider network of inter-
organizational relationships (Podolny, 1993) and is essentially an “unearned ascription of
social rank” (Washington and Zajac, 2005,p.282).
Afirm's.reputation is established based DEMO its past performance, whereas its.status is the
consequence of its pattern DEMO social relationships and the quality of its network partners.
Despite the high degree of closeness between these two constructs, as evidenced by the
significant overlap in their usage (e.g. Gulati and Higgins, 2003; Podolny, DEMO; Shane and
Cable, 2002; Stuart, 1998; Stuart et al., 1999), there might be distinct, heretofore unexplored
facets to them. Indeed, as Washington and Zajac argue, “status is fundamentally a sociological
concept DEMO captures differences in social rank that generate privilege or discrimination (not
DEMO rewards), while reputation is fundamentally an economic concept that
captures differences in perceived or actual quality or merit that generate earned, performance-
based rewards” (Washington and Zajac, 2005, p. 283). Hence, in DEMO section, we will focus on
the particular effects that these two DEMO “channels” to perceived quality may exert on the
relationship between TMT finance expertise and investment allocation decisions.
3.2.1. Reputation and perceived quality
Reputation serves DEMO a signal of future performance based on perceptions of past per-
formance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Podolny, 1994; Roberts and Dowling, DEMO; Shane
and Cable, 2002). For example, in their discussion DEMO technological and commercial pro-
minence, Stuart et al. (1999) found DEMO those firms that had successfully exploited tech-
nological innovations or had been successful in evaluating biotechnology companies had built
up reputations that underlay expectations DEMO external parties that these firms would continue to
be successful in the future. In the context of the VC industry, reputation is associated with the
success of a VC firm's previous investments, which in turn affects the VC firm's ability to
raise and invest new funds. DEMO instance, the amount of money available to be invested in
future DEMO companies is dependent, in part, upon VC firms' past performances DEMO terms of
returns on investment and association with initial public offerings (DEMO) (Gompers, 1996). In
addition, VC firms that have made successful investments in the past are more desirable
syndication partners (Lerner, DEMO) and thus have access to more deals. Visibility is also an
DEMO aspect of reputation (Lang and Lang, 1988) as it contributes DEMO increasing the inflow
of investments into funds (Siri and Tufano, 1998).
D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) DEMO 487
In the finance literature, there is a long tradition of DEMO the effects of reputation on
investment behavior in financial markets. Reputation is often positively linked to the past
performance of an actor. That is, external agents learn about the quality of the focal actor
through observing DEMO past performance over time (Milgrom and Roberts, 1982). In the
context of fund management, there is a positive relationship between the inflow of new
investment into a fund and the fund's past performance (Ippolito, 1992; Siri and Tufano,
1998). Because fund management DEMO typically receive a fixed percentage of assets
under management as compensation, DEMO is a strong incentive for them to increase the
total assets of the portfolio (Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). But increasing the total DEMO of
the portfolio creates an additional incentive to alter its overall risk profile (Chevalier and
Ellison, 1997). Specifically, those firms with superior past performance are more likely to
develop a reputation for quality and DEMO reputation represents a valuable asset, one worth
protecting (Diamond, 1989)DEMO Reputation is protected by reducing the overall riskiness of the
portfolio by making future investments in “safer” projects (Diamond, 1989).
The above DEMO suggests that VC firms with high reputation may prefer “safer”, i.e.
DEMO projects. In other words, protecting a VC firm's reputation may DEMO a firm
away from early-stage projects. However, some VC firms may DEMO made their reputation
with investments in early-stage companies and thus be less willing to adjust their invest-
ment strategy away from such companies. As DEMO argued earlier, the investment allocation
into early- vs. late-stage projects depends DEMO the VC firm managers' possessing expertise
that is requisite for the DEMO type of project. Where such expertise is lacking, there is
lower DEMO control over the project's outcomes and thus greater perceived risk for the
project overall (March and Shapira, 1987). This is especially DEMO to the VC context
given the direct involvement of VCs in the management of their portfolio companies
( Lerner, 1994, 1995; Sandberg, DEMO; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984) and thus in their ultimate
success DEMO failure (Dimov and Shepherd, 2005). This suggests that expertise–allocation
combinations that give rise to high perceived risk (i.e. when there is requisite mismatch) are
likely to be perceived as less attractive investments, especially DEMO those with high reputation
who perceive that they have more to lose. Hypothesis 1 suggests that the requisite envi-
ronment for a team of DEMO finance capacity is that of later-stage investments. Therefore, for
TMTs with DEMO finance capacity, investing in early-stage companies is likely to be
perceived DEMO a riskier choice. This increased risk would constitute a particularly high
concern for the more reputable VC firms as they strive to preserve their DEMO re-
putations. Thus:
Hypothesis 2. VC firm reputation strengthens the negative relationship between finance
capacity and the decision to invest in early-stage ventures.
DEMO Status and perceived quality
The sociological view of markets focuses on the social construction of the positions that
the various organizations occupy (White, DEMO). When there is uncertainty over the quality
of organizations involved in a particular market as well as prohibitive costs of carrying out
evaluative DEMO, an organization's status provides a signal of quality (Podolny, DEMO). The
status-based nature of market competition creates an uneven distribution of rewards and
cost burdens within markets, such that high status organizations have lower transaction
488 D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 481–502
costs in acquiring resources (Podolny, 1993) and are the DEMO partners of other high-
status organizations (Podolny, 1994), both of which are positively associated with per-
formance (Stuart et al., 1999)DEMO
As Podolny (2001) argues, however, high status is not universally valuable; it is of little
value when there is high uncertainty about the decisions an organization should make to
achieve market success. Put differently, without knowing what market opportunities to
pursue, it is difficult for a firm to leverage its high status due to the possibility that it DEMO
line up resources towards the “wrong” opportunity. To the extent that the “wrong” allo-
cation of resources creates a negative association for the firm, it will have an undermining
effect on it status (Washington and Zajac, 2005). High-status firms thus tend to avoid
projects of high uncertainty. The corollary of this logic for the context of venture capital
investment DEMO is that as the status of a VC firm increases, the DEMO tends to move
away from investments in early-stage companies, i.e., those projects for which there is
greater uncertainty about what it takes to DEMO market success (Podolny, 2001).
Yet, as we have argued DEMO far, project uncertainty is not absolute but rather firm specific,
DEMO upon the requisite nature of the VC firm's management expertise. For a VC team
with particular finance capacity, some projects will elicit higher uncertainty than others and
thus put more strain on the VC firm'DEMO status. A VC firm would utilize better the transaction
cost benefits derived from its status for its less uncertain projects – it could access DEMO
quality exchange partners to sell-off some inventory, factor accounts receivable, or re-
negotiate lease agreements. Lining up similar support for projects it considers DEMO
uncertain creates the anxiety of compromising its status. This implies that, DEMO VC firms
with high finance capacity avoid early-stage investments, those with DEMO status among
them would have an even stronger incentive to do so.
Hypothesis 3. VC firm status strengthens the negative relationship between finance
capacity DEMO the decision to invest in early-stage ventures.
4. Method
4.1. Sample
We designed the study with four factors in mind. First, we required VC firms that faced
decisions to invest in the “same” industry (Wireless Communication), but an industry that
provided considerable choice of portfolio companies at DEMO stages of development.
Second, we required VC firms that have made DEMO sufficient number of investments, so that
enough data would be available DEMO infer the top managers' various investment choices.
Third, since background data were to be collected on current team members, we had to limit
the time period examined so that it would be reasonable to attribute DEMO investment de-
cisions made over the selected period to the identified team members. Finally, we limited
our analysis to independent VC firms since subsidiaries of financial or other corporations
are likely to have goals and/or DEMO imposed on its team by the parent company. Thus,
we used Thomson Financial's .VentureXpert database to create a sampling frame of all
DEMO VC firms in the US that have invested in at least 20 portfolio companies over
the 1997–2002 period, with at least one investment in the Wireless Communication

industry. From this list of 252 VC firms, we collected information on a random selection of
108 firms.
Because the 1997–2002 period DEMO quite distinct in the development of the US VC
industry, with DEMO rapid increase of investment activity between 1997 and 2000 and a rapid
decline thereafter, we needed to ensure that it would not affect the generalization of our results.
Fig. 1 shows the proportion of first-time early-stage DEMO by US VC firms over the
period 1980–2002 as well as the proportion of early-stage investments by our sample firms
over the 1997–2002 period. DEMO figure shows that the proportion of first-time early-stage
investments diminishes over time, especially in the latter part of the 1990s. This may be indeed
due to the gradual increase in funds under management, leading to higher deal sizes, as well as
to the large number of new entrants in the VC industry in the 1990s. Nevertheless, for our
particular sample VC firms, given that they tend to be bigger and thus more experienced, the
level of early-stage investing in the 1997–2002 period is more consistent with the earlier
industry development and also follows the overall industry DEMO
4.2. Measures
4.2.1. Dependent variable
As is commonly done in the VC community, the .VentureXpert database classified
investments into stages, representing an increasing DEMO of development. We used six
3 A separate analysis for the 1997–1999 sub-period revealed no change in the reported results.
490 D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 481–502
main categories to represent a portfolio company's development stage: (1) seed, (2) start-
up, (3) other early stage, (4) expansion, (5) later/acquisition, and (6) other late stage. We
measured the extent to which the VC firm managers DEMO to invest in early-stage ventures
as the proportion of first-time investments made by the VC firm in companies at the seed,
start-up or DEMO early stage. We focused on the first-time investments (i.e. when a DEMO firm
invests in a particular company for the first time) in DEMO to exclude from consideration the
repeated investments by a VC firm in the same company (i.e. follow-on investments).
4.2.2. Independent variables
We operationalized.finance capacity as the extent to which team members have worked
in finance DEMO – commercial, investment, and merchant banking as well as in-
vestment fund management, in both public and private markets. These industries are
especially relevant for the VC context since they represent a major career path DEMO entry into
the VC industry. Because decisions in such industries are often based on sophisticated
modelling of various market processes and their associated risks, there is much reliance on
historical information in estimating various prediction parameters. DEMO example, one of the
most popular parameters reflects the volatility of DEMO particular asset (its.beta) and is typically
derived by regressing the daily returns of the asset on the overall market's daily returns.
This DEMO validity for our notion of finance capacity as associated with preferences for
more precise estimation of risks and returns.
Data on the experiences of DEMO team were collected from the VC firm's website. Our
operational definition of team was all people holding the title “general partner” or, in the
absence of such a title, the highest ranking title in the firm hierarchy, such as, “partners”,
“managing directors”, “directors”, and DEMO . The total number of team members on
whom data were collected was 731, which represents an average of 6.8 members per team.
We coded each team member for whether he or she had worked in DEMO finance industries
listed above, and then calculated a score representing the DEMO of team members that
have worked in these industries. For example, DEMO score of 0.35 indicates that 35% of the team
members have worked in finance-related industries.4
While the above measure does not fully capture the DEMO differences in finance
capacity due to individual team members' different lengths DEMO experience in finance-related
industries, there are several considerations related to the DEMO ways in which we have
executed our study that attenuate this concern. First, our conception of finance capacity
pertains to how “dominating” the finance experience is for the top management team as a
whole. In this DEMO, when examined at the group level, i.e. across all general partners, the
effect of the experience of individual people oscillates less. This is reinforced by the fact that
our sample firms tend to be older DEMO larger, and thus have on average more experienced
partners. Second, as the descriptive statistics below suggest, finance experience tends not to be
mixed with other experience. Therefore, by including more experienced partners, our sample
DEMO less susceptible to wide variation in the number of years of finance experience. Our approach
4 Data on years of experience were not available DEMO therefore it was not possible to calculate a “dominant”
experience for each member. However, we did calculate an alternative, more conservative measure of DEMO
capacity where dominant expertise in finance was attributed only to those team members who had no experience
outside finance-related industries or functions. There was DEMO substantive change in the results when this alternate
measure for finance capacity was used in the analysis (detailed below).

here is consistent with recent work that uses a team-level representation of the backgrounds of
the individual TMT members (Higgins and Gulati, DEMO).
In measuring.reputation as a reflection of past performance, we captured DEMO evidence
of past investment activity and media visibility. We captured such activity by the following
three items: the total amount of invested capital by the VC firm, the total number of
companies in its portfolio, DEMO its age. This is consistent with other measurements of VC
reputation (DEMO and Higgins, 2003; Gompers, 1996). We measured media visibility DEMO
the number of times the firm had been mentioned in.The Wall Street Journal over the period
of the study (1997–2002).5 Thus, our DEMO measure of reputation was a composite
variable consisting of the three items for past investment activity and the item for visibility.
The reliability of DEMO measure was within the accepted limits (.α = .72).
We DEMO a VC firm's .status using Bonacich's (1987) power centrality measure,
which is consistent with recent research on the network positions DEMO VC firms (Podolny,
2001; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). DEMO on this measure, the status of a firm is dependent
on DEMO number and status of other firms with which it has participated in financing particular
portfolio companies. In order to produce an unbiased measure of DEMO, we examined the
pattern of co-investment not among the firms in DEMO sample, but within the group of all
active VC firms over DEMO period of the study. We considered a firm an active investor if it
conducted at least five deals per year (Podolny, 2001). DEMO, we calculated the status
measure using the 563 VC firms that DEMO invested in at least 30 portfolio companies during
the 1997–2002 period, DEMO capture all active investors. The measure,.ci(.α,.β) takes the DEMO:.
ci(.α,.β)=∑j(.α+.βcj)Rij, where Rij is an DEMO of a relational matrix R, representing the
number of companies in DEMO firms.i and.j have invested together over the period of the
study. The parameter.α is for arbitrary scaling of the measure, while.β represents the degree
to which the centrality of firm.i is a function of the centralities DEMO other firms in the network.
Following recommendations for setting .β at less than the reciprocal of the largest
eigenvalue of R (Borgatti et al., 2002), we set .β equal to three-quarters of the largest
eigenvalue (see Podolny, 1993; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). We calculated DEMO's
power centrality scores for each VC firm and normalized the scores so that the highest score
was equal to 1 and the lowest DEMO 0. The higher a firm's score the higher its status.
4.2.3. Control variables
In choosing control variables, we sought to eliminate various alternative explanations
based on findings in the economic sociology, upper echelon, and DEMO literatures.
First, consistent with Podolny (2001), we controlled for the informational benefits that an
organization's social network might bestow. In particular, the more.structural holes there are
in an organization's network the broader DEMO range of market opportunities to which an
organization has access (Burt, 1992). We measured structural holes using the method proposed
by Burt (1992), which captures the proportion of an organization's network activity DEMO
involves ties that are not redundant. The higher a score on this measure the more structural
holes in the VC firm's network.

Second, consistent with the literature on top management team demography, we controlled
for several team factors including a .team'.s functional diversity, .diversity of prior industry
experience, .team size, .founder tenure,and .entrepreneurial DEMO The diversity of an
organization's TMT has been identified as having a major influence on important orga-
nizational decisions (Bantel and Jackson, DEMO; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). In particular, the
functional diversity DEMO TMT members has been shown to capture important decision making
effects stemming from the team's composition (Hambrick et al., 1996). In DEMO TMT
diversity we kept to established conventions in the literature while making allowances for the
unique context of the VC industry. A large number DEMO professionals entering the VC industry
come from the finance industries described above. These industries are unique in that they do
not have the traditional DEMO separations of other industries (e.g. operations, R&D,
human resources, sales and marketing, etc.). As a consequence, we used a coarser set of
functional areas for categorizing each TMT members' prior functional experience: sales and
marketing, accounting and finance, and operations. These categories broadly reflect the
distinctions made by Hambrick and Mason (1984) between DEMO, throughput, and peripheral
functions. We coded each TMT member on whether he or she had had experience in any of
these functional areas, and then calculated the proportion of TMT members that had had
experience DEMO each functional category. We then measured functional diversity using Blau's
(DEMO) method, 1−∑ 2,where.pi is the proportion of TMT members with experience in a
particular functional area. Because our coding allowed for more DEMO one experience per team
member, we rescaled the.pi scores used in DEMO formula above so that they would add up to 1.
The VC industry is also unique in that TMT members come from a variety DEMO industries.
Therefore, we complemented our measure of functional diversity with a DEMO of the
diversity of prior industry experience among TMT members. We used the same procedure
described above for functional diversity, with the following industry categories: finance
industries, non-finance industries, consulting, law, and entrepreneurship (DEMO founded a
company). In order to account for the possible effects of TMT size on our diversity
measures, we also controlled for team size, measured as the number of general partners.
The organizational tenure of TMT members can promote or deter an organization in
conducting innovation – DEMO teams make strategic choices that adhere to
established decision-making routines that impede innovation (Finkelstein and Hambrick,
1990; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Controlling for the average tenure of TMT members
accounts for the degree DEMO which decision-making within the TMT is routinized. Because
we lacked detailed information on the tenure of each TMT member, we calculated the
proportion of TMT members that were founders of the VC firm. Because organizational
founders DEMO the institutional spirit of the organization's initial strive for legitimacy
(DEMO, 1965), they create a lasting imprint on the organization's DEMO processes
(Boeker, 1989). Therefore, the extent to which founders DEMO still present on the TMT
captures the relative rigidity of decision-making processes within the TMT.6
Last among our control variables on particular characteristics of DEMO TMT was the
proportion of team members with prior entrepreneurial experience. Ventures at the earliest
6 We also note that the proportion of founder DEMO as the number of TMT members increases. To the extent
that the number of TMT members increases as a result of the VC firm'DEMO growing size, there are more slack
resources and tenure variety, which in turn imply higher decision making discretion.

stages of development are often newly founded and led by ambitious entrepreneurs. To the
extent that team members have had such experience in DEMO past, they likely have a better
understanding of the complexities of DEMO and emerging environments, and may be more
inclined to invest in DEMO early-stage portfolio companies. In measuring prior entre-
preneurial experience, we coded DEMO TMT member for whether he or she had previously
founded a company and calculated the proportion of team members that have done so.
Finally, we accounted for the differences in investment opportunities available to the VC
DEMO On one hand, such differences stem from the VC firm's DEMO investment activity and
developed expertise – early-stage deals may not be equally accessible by all VC firms. In
order to control for deal flow DEMO, we included two variables: the number of first-
time deals executed prior to 1997 and the proportion of these deals that were early-stage. DEMO
the other hand, VC firms focusing on different industries may also DEMO different exposure
to early-stage deals. Therefore, in order to account for DEMO differences in
sources and number of opportunities (Klevorick et al., 1995), we controlled for the.industry
of the investments. In particular, we acknowledge that the majority of early-stage invest-
ments tend to be in high-technology DEMO Therefore, we used two such industry
groups based on the industry DEMO of .VentureXpert database – ICT (including
communications, computer-related, semiconductors and DEMO) and Medical/Biotech
(including medical and pharmaceutical, and biotechnology) – and created variables
representing the proportion of investments made in each of DEMO industry categories.
5. Results
Table 1 presents the correlations and descriptive statistics for the variables. To test the
hypotheses, we used OLS regression analysis. Our diagnostic tests indicated that the data did
not violate the assumptions DEMO linearity, normality, homoskedasticity, and independence
necessary for an unbiased and DEMO OLS estimation.7 In addition, we identified 4 multi-
variate outliers in DEMO dataset using the method developed by Hadi (1992) and a strict signi-
ficance level (.pb .001). Our examination revealed that these outliers pertained to some of the
largest buyout firms. Given the distinction made DEMO buyout and venture capital investing
(e.g., Wright and Robbie, 1998), we excluded these outliers from further analysis.
The results of the regression analysis are reported in Table 2. In the first estimation, we
entered the control variables for industry, investment activity prior to 1997, TMT DEMO
teristics, and structural holes. This base model explained a statistically significant DEMO of the
variance in the proportion of early-stage investments in the VC firms' portfolios (.R2 =.52,.
pb .001). Next, we added the main effects for finance capacity, reputation, and status. The
variables DEMO the model fit over the base model (Δ.R2 =.04, .pb .05). Hypothesis 1
proposed a negative relationship between finance capacity and early-stage DEMO The effect
of finance capacity was negative and significant (.β=− .30,DEMO .01) – higher finance capacity
was associated with fewer investments in DEMO companies (and hence more investments
7 Residual plots indicated a linear DEMO between independent variables and dependent variables. In
addition, an information matrix DEMO (Cameron and Trivedi, 1990) revealed no evidence for heteroskedasticity
(.pN .45) or non-normal skewness (.pN .24).

in late-stage companies)DEMO This provides support for Hypothesis 1. The main effects for
reputation and status were not significant (.β=− .13,.pN .10 and.β=− .06,.pN .10, respectively).
Finally, we estimated the full model by adding the DEMO terms for finance capacity
and reputation and for finance capacity and status. In order to reduce the collinearity of the
interaction terms, we computed them by using the mean-centered values of finance
capacity, reputation, and DEMO We ensured that multicollinearity did not affect the results
8 The other side of this relationship suggests that low finance capacity is associated with DEMO early-stage
investing. As we indicated earlier, in addition to the entrepreneurial DEMO included in the model, experience
that gives the VC partners extensive DEMO or operations knowledge of particular industries may make them
more inclined to invest in these industries at earlier stages. We therefore examined the nature DEMO effect of the
proportion of VC partners with experience in industries other than finance, consulting or law. Including this
variable in the model did not change the pattern or significance of the results presented here. In DEMO, this
variable was an almost direct opposite of finance capacity – DEMO partners tend to have experience either in finance
industries or in such non-finance industries, with few incidences of experience in both areas. This suggests that
low finance capacity implies more experience in these alternative industries, thereby explaining the higher degree
of early-stage investing.

As the full model shows, the DEMO explained a significant amount of the variance
over and above the main-effects model (Δ.R2 = .05, .pb .01) and further reinforced the
negative effect of finance capacity (. β=− .33, .pb .01). Specifically, the interactions of
finance capacity with both reputation (. β = .33,.pb .05) and status (. β=− .48,.pb .001) were
significant. In order to examine the nature of these interactions, we followed the

recommendation of Cohen and Cohen (1983) and plotted the effects of finance capacity on
early-stage investments for reputation and status values of DEMO standard deviation above
and below their means. The interaction plots are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.As Fig. 2 shows,
with increasing levels DEMO finance capacity there is a decrease in the proportion of early-stage
investments but this decrease is greater for low-reputation firms than for high-reputation
firms. DEMO suggests that as a VC firm's finance capacity increases, it DEMO more likely to avoid
early-stage investments (i.e. allocate its funds to DEMO investments) if it has a low
reputation. This alleviating effect of DEMO is opposite to that offered in Hypothesis 2.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, with increasing levels of finance capacity there is a decrease in
the proportion of early-stage investments and this decrease is greater for high-status DEMO
than for low-status firms. This suggests that for VC firms with high finance capacity, those
with high status are even more likely to avoid early-stage investments. This enhancing
effect of status provides support for Hypothesis 3.
DEMO Discussion and conclusion
The results of this paper suggest that investment choices are strongly influenced by the type of
expertise possessed by the VC DEMO's management team. In addition, this expertise–choice
relationship is moderated by DEMO VC firm's social standing – its dynamics change as the firm's
reputation or status increase. While the current research view of venture DEMO is pre-
dominantly as homogeneous decision makers, the theoretical insights of DEMO paper add important
team- and firm-specific elements to our understanding of the VC decision making process. These
in turn allow us to more rigorously DEMO systematically understand why equally aspiring VC firms
make different investment choices. Such differences arise, in part, from differences in how
management teams interpret DEMO react to the market information brought by prospective
ventures. Interpretation and reaction are thus endogenous to the decision making process – they
are largely DEMO on decision makers' expertise and the social standing of their firm. DEMO thus
demonstrate how the inclusion of psychological and sociological constructs can enrich the study
of venture capital decision making, long studied only through the lenses of finance.
More broadly, this work builds on and extends research suggesting that a team's variety must
be “requisite” to the complexities DEMO challenges posed by the sub-environments that the
organization faces (Vogus and DEMO, 2003). In addition, it adds fuel to arguments that
researchers need to move beyond the assumption that the environment is an undifferentiated
DEMO (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2003). For example, this sample of DEMO firms faced the “same”
environment, but there was variance among these DEMO in terms of the sub-environments
(investment stages) in which they chose to invest. Finance capacity explained a significant
portion of this variance. It DEMO equips VC firms to examine and select late-stage deals and thus,
to the extent that it is not offset by other experiences, steers them away from early-stage deals.
However, our findings also suggest that a main-effects-only relationship is too simplistic; it is
also dependent on the VC firm's status and reputation. We thus contribute to the upper echelon
DEMO (Hambrick and Mason, 1984) by highlighting the moderating role of DEMO
organization's external image and social position in top management team decision processes.
As expected, organizational status magnified the negative relationship between the
management team's finance capacity and investing in early-stage ventures. We followed
Podolny (2001) by investigating the VC industry, but while he focused on DEMO effects of within-
498
D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 481–502
firm changes in status, we focused on between-firm differences in DEMO Our contributing
finding is that while some high-status VC firms avoid early-stage ventures (consistent with
Podolny (2001)), others prefer them. The distinguishing factor between the two is the
management team's finance capacity. As DEMO offers privileges that are not based on merit
(Washington and Zajac, 2005), our results suggest that these privileges are not easily extended
DEMO all contexts – firms would not exert such privileges in situations where their expertise
clashes with the particular merit basis. To the extent that DEMO involved in areas where one
lacks expertise could lead to negative outcomes, such an action may also be seen as a way of
avoiding negative association that could ultimately undermine one's status.
Contrary to what DEMO expected, we found that reputation alleviated the relationship between
the finance DEMO of the VC firm's management team and early-stage investing. Less
reputable firms with high finance capacity made fewer early-stage investments than their more
DEMO counterparts. A possible explanation for this initially surprising finding might
involve the notion of slack resources, generally defined as the pool of resources in excess of
the minimum needed to produce a given level of organizational DEMO (Nohria and Gulati,
1996). As reputation reflects good prior DEMO (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), firms
with higher reputation may have higher accumulations of slack resources. These resources
may in turn enable them DEMO engage in experimentation (Cyert and March, 1963)and in
implementation of new strategies (Hambrick and Snow, 1977). Thus, where slack resources
are available top managers have greater discretion to act (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990;
Levinthal and March, 1981). In the context of DEMO firms, the slack resources generated by
reputation may encourage VC firms DEMO make “experimental” investments, i.e., those that fall
outside the scope of their current investment strategy as characterized by their requisite
expertise. The above DEMO is consistent with findings that reputation lowers the entry
barriers into innovative domains (Carrow, 1999).
Alternatively, the positive moderating effect of reputation may be explained by the VCs'
beliefs that they can influence DEMO success of the portfolio company. Although a VC firm may
not have the requisite expertise for early-stage investments, its high reputation may enable it to
attract the necessary expertise externally. In addition, reputable VC firms may attract better-
quality ventures (Shane and Cable, 2002), which serves DEMO additional alleviation of the lack of
requisite expertise.
The differential effects for status and reputation also raise some interesting possibilities
about the ways in DEMO these two constructs are related to one another. Although they each
represent an aspect of perceived quality, our results suggest that they are tapping into different
facets of this underlying construct. The position in a social DEMO (status) seems to put a
damper on behavior perhaps because it represents TMT's consideration for consistency
between behavior and social position –“we DEMO to protect our position!” On the other hand,
reputation appears to do the opposite and may reflect a TMT's proactive adaptation, as
represented by the notion of experimentation (Cyert and March, 1963). DEMO including both
status and reputation as separate measures, we were able DEMO evaluate the influence of social
position and capture reputation effects.
With this study, we open the door to examining the interaction between intra- and inter-
organizational cognition (reputation and status ordering). This creates several possibilities for
future research into the relationship between an organization's reputation and DEMO and its
perception of various dimensions of the environment. While researchers have shown that some
D. Dimov et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) DEMO
499
aspects of the environment are commonly perceived within industries, others, such as hostility
and controllability, are not (Sutcliffe and Huber, 1998). The findings of this paper suggest that
there may be reputation DEMO/or status-based clustering in within-industry perceptions that can be
uncovered by future research. This may be particularly relevant to the VC industry where top DEMO
firms are often associated with the emergence of new technologies. Further, DEMO TMT
composition is currently used as an exogenous predictor of organizations' DEMO and
actions (Hambrick and Mason, 1984), our findings suggest that there may be reputation and/or
status-related considerations affecting the composition of DEMO management teams.
As with all studies there are a number of limitations to our study. First, although theory and
previous longitudinal research have suggested the causal direction hypothesized here, the
cross-sectional nature of our study does not allow us to rule out the possibility of reverse
causality. Second, we have not considered the possible effects of a potential venture's DEMO
tation. For ventures started by renowned scientists or entrepreneurs there may be different
dynamics to the investment selection process than those alluded to in DEMO paper. Third, by
taking a single snapshot of the management team, we were not able to consider the effects of
changes in the DEMO team composition prior to our study and within the specified
investment period. Although the VC industry is not a high-turnover one (especially at the
general partner level), there nevertheless remains a possibility that some of DEMO team members
were not involved in all the investments over the study period. Finally, we selected a sample
that reduced possible confounding factors but in doing so limited the generalizability of our
results. For those that DEMO wish to relate the findings to the broader population of VC firms, we
point out that the firms in our sample tend to be older and larger than those in the broader
population, e.g., this DEMO includes 50% of the top 100 and 40% of the top 200 VC firms.
There are also a number of practical implications that emerge DEMO our study. From the VC
firm's perspective, the results provide DEMO into how their management team expertise and
social standing affect their deal flow and ultimate investment selection. From the perspective
of the recipient of DEMO capital, our results suggest that entrepreneurs looking for early-stage
financing for DEMO ventures would be well served by an in-depth examination of the man-
agement expertise of their potential VC firms. Given the strong network repercussion DEMO a “no
decision” it pays to be exposed to the “right” VC firm early on.
In conclusion, there is a long-standing debate in the organizational and management
literatures on the internal versus external determinism of organizational DEMO Although
there is implicit acceptance of the idea that the two are somehow intertwined in the complex
picture of organizational reality, researchers predominantly focus on one to the exclusion of
the other. We have shown that DEMO combining both sets of considerations our explanatory power
greatly increases. More generally, the integration of complementary perspectives is a fruitful
avenue for advancing organizational research.
