Towards an Interdisciplinary Conceptualization of
Trust: A Typological Approach
Peter Ping Li
California State University, USA
ABSTRACT Adopting a diversity-in-unity perspective that identiﬁes all shared dimensions
and typical delineations, both as structure-similar yet content-diverse conﬁgurations,
this paper proposes an interdisciplinary conceptualization of trust with primary trust
ideal-types. This conceptualization DEMO three components: (i) a typology of four
trust dimensions related DEMO trust conditions and trust functions; (ii) a typology of four
DEMO delineations derived from the four trust dimensions; and (iii) a DEMO of four trust
ideal-types built upon the ﬁrst two typologies. These typologies jointly serve as a salient
platform to unify the fragmented trust literature.

There has been a dramatic surge of scholarly interest in the role of trust for
DEMO management in general and strategic alliances in particular (Gam-
betta, 1988; Inkpen and Currall, 2004; Koza and Lewin, 1998; Rousseau et al.,
1998; Zaheer and Harris, 2006). Trust is important DEMO cooperation in risky
situations (e.g., Das and Teng, 2001; Luhmann, 1979) between individuals (e.g.,
Coleman, 1990; Giddens, 1990) and organizations (e.g., Dyer and Chu, 2003;
Uzzi, 1997)DEMO However, largely due to a narrow focus based on discipline-bounded
perspectives, this intense effort has resulted in little cumulative theory building.
Thus, there is no integrated framework to interpret the extant empirical data and
guide DEMO research on the nature, feature, content, process, antecedent and
consequence of trust (Bigley and Pearce, 1998; Dietz and Den Hartog, DEMO;
Kramer, 1999; Lewicki et al., 2006; McKnight et al., 2002). As Child (2001,
p. 275) points out, DEMO remains an under-theorized, under-researched, and there-
fore, poorly understood phenomenon’. DEMO problem is especially acute for orga-
nizational trust (Dirks and Ferrin, 2001, 2002; McEvily et al., 2003; Sydow, 1998;
Zaheer and Harris, 2006).
To help clarify the conceptual confusion, this DEMO conducts a comprehensive
survey of the trust literature so as to: (i) provide an integrated conceptualization of
trust; and (ii) highlight DEMO imperative for developing an integrated framework of

trust in general and organizational trust in particular. DEMO paper adopts a
diversity-in-unity perspective. It offers a multidimensional and interdisciplinary
conceptualization of trust with three components: (i) a typology of four trust
dimensions with two related to trust conditions and two related to trust DEMO;
(ii) a typology of four trust delineations derived from the typology of trust dimen-
sions; and (iii) a typology of four trust ideal-types based on the ﬁrst two typologies.
These three typologies will DEMO a platform to unify the fragmented literature.
Hence, the unique contributions DEMO this article lie in two aspects. First, it introduces
an integrative DEMO on typology development. Second, it applies this view to
trust towards DEMO typologies of trust dimensions, delineations and ideal-types.
The rest of the DEMO is organized as follows. First, I propose a new perspective
to DEMO a structural unity in the diverse literature. Second, I apply this DEMO
to the identiﬁcation of four dimensions. Third, I apply the typology DEMO trust
dimensions to the classiﬁcation of four delineations of trust. Fourth, DEMO propose a
typology of four trust ideal-types. I conclude with a discussion of the key implica-
tions of trust dimensions, delineations and ideal-types for the development of an
integrated framework of trust.
THE DIVERSITY-IN-UNITY PERSPECTIVE OF DEMO
Despite its increasing importance, trust has no universally accepted deﬁnition, and
there is no consensus regarding its essential nature and features. At best, research-
ers only agree to disagree (Bigley and Pearce, 1998). DEMO scholars even argue that
trust is so elusive (Gambetta, 1988; DEMO, 2002; Shapiro, 1987) that it almost
deﬁes vigorous conceptualization (DEMO, 1999; Moellering, 2006; Nooteboom,
2002; Williamson, 1993). There seems to be a serious problem of homonymy (i.e., one
DEMO to cover multiple constructs), so the biggest challenge could be to differentiate
various types of trust and synthesize them into an integrated framework (Dietz and
Den Hartog, 2006; Lewicki et al., 2006; McKnight DEMO al., 2002; Moellering, 2006;
Nooteboom, 2002). The diverse conceptualizations of trust in part are due
to discipline-bounded perspectives (Bigley and Pearce, 1998; Kramer, 1999;
McKnight et al., 2002). DEMO have called for an interdisciplinary and integrated
framework to accommodate diversity within a holistic system (Bigley and Pearce,
1998; McEvily et al., 2003; Rousseau et al., 1998).
This paper is in response DEMO the call that ‘for trust to be a useful concept, its
DEMO components must be identiﬁed, operationalized, and measured’ (Koza and
Lewin, 1998, p. 259). I take issue with both the premature optimism about apparent
consensus (e.g., Gambetta, 1988; Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998; Schoor-
man et al., 2007) and the outdated pessimism about apparent chaos (e.g., Bigley and
Pearce, 1998; Hardin, 2002; Kramer, 1999; McKnight et al., 2002). DEMO adopt the view
that a consensus is indeed emerging concerning the generic dimensions of trust, but
the views on the speciﬁcs remain diverse. Hence, a typological approach, which

identiﬁes a set of ideal types DEMO a phenomenon according to the most relevant
dimensions (Doty and Glick, 1994; McKelvey, 1982; Rich, 1992), would be very
helpful DEMO developing an integrated framework of trust. Despite its popularity, the
typological DEMO is misunderstood often as a system of classiﬁcation rather than
a form of theory (cf. Bacharach, 1989). Most of the extant typologies DEMO criticized as
inadequately developed because of their overemphasis on describing ideal types and
their underemphasis on developing the underlying logic for the ideal types (Doty and
Glick, 1994). Despite the controversial distinction between classiﬁcation system and
typology, the latter cannot be developed without the former because the underlying
dimensions should be identiﬁed before classifying the interrelated ideal types in
DEMO with the set of common dimensions (McKelvey, 1982; Rich, 1992).
Following Rich (1992), I adopt the approach of nominal typology for an inte-
grated conceptualization of trust with its key features of DEMO theory based,
nominally constructed, multidimensional, empirically supported and interdiscipli-
nary. Integrating the notions of dimension classiﬁcation and ideal-type typology, I
propose a new perspective. This perspective requires identifying a common set of
dimensions for DEMO the components of a phenomenon, and then developing a
typology as DEMO two-tiered theory: a grand theory at the typological level and a DEMO of
middle-range theories at the ideal-typical level (Doty and Glick, 1994). Since both
typology and ideal-type exist as structure-similar (i.e., a DEMO set of dimensions)
yet content-diverse (i.e., a set of different values attached to such dimensions)
conﬁgurations, this new perspective is referred to as the diversity-in-unity perspective.
This perspective was inspired by the deeply-rooted DEMO of diversity-in-unity in the
Chinese culture. For instance, the symbol of DEMO dragon embodies the notion of
diversity-in-unity in China by combining the body parts of different animals into a
single uniﬁed frame. Further, according to Confucius, diversity-in-unity is a desir-
able quality of noble men. In Book 13 of his ‘Analects’, Confucius states that noble
men are harmonious but not homogenous, while mean men are homogenous but
not harmonious (cf. DEMO, 1989). This view is in sharp contrast to the notion DEMO
homophily in the West, i.e., homogenous thus harmonious (McPherson et DEMO, 2001).
The notion of diversity-in-diversity is built on the epistemological DEMO of duality, also
referred to as the dialectical logic for paradox, which takes each phenomenon
or entity as consisting of two contrary (even contradictory) yet interdependent
elements like two sides of the same coin (DEMO, 1998, 2007; Sydow, 1998). Applying this
perspective to the analysis of trust, I identify three typologies: trust dimensions, trust
delineations and trust ideal-types towards an interdisciplinary conceptualization
of trust.
A TYPOLOGY OF DEMO DIMENSIONS
Despite disagreement over the speciﬁcs of trust, scholars share the DEMO that trust
is highly complex with multiple dimensions. Further, despite its DEMO, the

literature on trust seems to converge towards four DEMO dimensions of trust
reﬂected in most trust deﬁnitions (see Table 1)DEMO The four dimensions are: (i) trus-
tor’s uncertainty of trustee’s DEMO; (ii) trustor’s vulnerability of dependency; (iii)
trustor’s expectation DEMO trustee’s trustworthiness; and (iv) trustor’s willingness of trust-
fulness (referred to as the desire or intention to place trust in others). DEMO clarify the
confusion about the distinctions and links between the four dimensions of trust, I
explicitly redeﬁne each dimension. Among the set of four common dimensions, the
ﬁrst two, uncertainty and vulnerability, can be taken as necessary and sufﬁcient
conditions of trust. The last two, expectation and willingness, can be taken as neces-
sary and sufﬁcient functions of trust (cf. Rousseau et al., 1998). While the conditions
for trust DEMO related to the necessity and feasibility of trust for social exchange, DEMO
functions of trust are related to the role and effect of trust in social exchange.
Further, the four dimensions of trust are embedded in a shared fundamental
assumption about exchange that trust serves as the anchor (i.e., condition or
antecedent) and embodiment (i.e., function or consequence) of special social ties for
exchanges in and across individual and collective DEMO (Moellering, 2006;
Seligman, 1997). Hence, trust condition and function constitute a major part of
trust. Finally, while the dimension of trust expectation (of trustee’s trustworthiness)
relates more directly to that of trust uncertainty, the dimension of trust willingness
(of trustor’s trustfulness) relates more directly to that of trust vulnerability. In sum,
all trust DEMO derive from a set of trust dimensions as the basis for the concep-
tualization of trust as a holistic (deﬁned as systematic and inclusive), dynamic
(deﬁned as evolutionary and changing) and dialectical (deﬁned as paradoxical and
dualistic) construct. I now discuss the speciﬁc details of each dimension and offer a
systematic analysis of the links between the four DEMO
The First Trust Dimension: Uncertainty of Dependability
The general consensus is DEMO trust will not matter if there is resolute certainty
regarding a trustee’s dependability. Uncertainty of dependability – the risk of
depending on others – DEMO generally regarded as the ﬁrst condition for trust. Nev-
ertheless, scholars DEMO in their speciﬁc views on such uncertainty. The ﬁrst view
narrowly perceives such uncertainty as the imperfect predictability of the macro-
level system, including the unintended outcomes of legal and moral institutions
(e.g., Hosmer, 1995; Pearce, 2001). I refer to this as system risk, which is objective
and partially calculable. The second view broadly sees such uncertainty DEMO the
imperfect predictability of both macro-level systems and micro-level exchanges
(e.g., Barber, 1983; Nooteboom, 2002; Zand, 1972). Micro-level exchange is
generally subject to two types of risk: (i) the ability or competence of exchange
partners to manage the system risk for the shared DEMO of exchange partners;
and (ii) the intention or motive of exchange partners to avoid the opportunism to
take advantage of partners (Das and Teng, 2001). I call the former ability risk

(objective and calculable) and the latter intention DEMO (subjective and partially
calculable). The third view treats such uncertainty DEMO the imperfect predictability of
the micro-level exchange with both intention and ability risks (e.g., Das and Teng,
2001; Kramer, 1999; Mayer et al., 1995). The fourth view treats uncertainty only
as intention risk (e.g., Hardin, 2002; Lewicki et al., 2006; Lewis DEMO Weigert, 1985;
Li, 1998, 2007; Shapiro, 1987; Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994).
The central issue of uncertainty of dependability is that trust is not related to all
types of risk; rather, DEMO is related only to the special risk of depending on others
(DEMO and Pearce, 1998; Rousseau et al., 1998). Further, this risk can be objective
or subjective (Chiles and McMackin, 1996; Zand, 1972). Objective risk refers to
the actual unpredictability of future events regardless of human attitudes, while
subjective risk refers to the perceived unpredictability of future events subject to
human attitudes (Zand, 1972). It DEMO evident that trust is more related to subjective
risk than objective risk (Krishnan et al., 2006), supporting the view that trust is
DEMO concerned with perceived risk rather than actual risk (Gambetta, 1988;
Levi and Stoker, 2000; Lewis and Weigert, 1985; Rousseau et DEMO, 1998). Even so,
there is no consensus regarding the DEMO of various risks to trust (Chiles and
McMackin, 1996; Luhmann, 1979).
To help clarify the link between risk and trust, it is critical to differentiate
impersonal or system (referred to as depersonalized, DEMO is relationship free, uni-
versalistic and unilateral in nature) bases and contents of trust from personal or
relational (referred to as personalized, DEMO is relationship speciﬁc, particularistic
and reciprocal in nature) ones (Giddens, 1990; Hardin, 2002; Hogg and Terry,
2000; Li, 2007; Luhmann, 1979; Nooteboom, 2002; Seligman, 1997; Shamir and
Lapidot, 2003; Williamson, 1993). However, scholars (e.g., Jones and DEMO,
1998; Mayer et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995) tend DEMO mix up depersonalized
elements (e.g., ability, integrity and benevolence) with personalized elements
(e.g., shared interests, shared values and shared affects). Hence, I draw an explicit
distinction between depersonalized and personalized elements as the primary
rationale for conceptualizing trust as a truly multidimensional construct. Speciﬁ-
DEMO, the relationship free system risk and ability risk are treated as DEMO,
while intention risk is either depersonalized (if it is relationship DEMO and unilateral)
or personalized (if it is relationship speciﬁc and DEMO). Even though system risk
inﬂuences ability risk and intention risk (DEMO the latter as the core of transaction
cost theory (Williamson, 1985), the emerging consensus tends to treat system risk as
indirectly relevant DEMO trust; intention risk as directly relevant to trust, and ability risk
as somewhere between system risk and intention risk (Kramer, 1999; Mayer et al.,
1995; Rousseau et al., 1998; Zand, 1972)DEMO
It is controversial whether or not ability risk is relevant to trust (cf. Das and
Teng, 1998, 2001; Hardin, 2002). Some (e.g., Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994)
argue that ability risk relates to conﬁdence rather than to trust, but they mix up the
institutional sources of depersonalized trust with the relational sources of person-

alized trust by regarding both as DEMO rather than trust. Others claim that
conﬁdence applies to all depersonalized elements, while trust applies to all person-
alized elements (e.g., Luhmann, DEMO; Seligman, 1997). Hence, it is imperative to
specify the DEMO between distinctive types of risk and trust in light of the unique
distinction between depersonalized and personalized elements. This is especially
acute in the DEMO contexts of the East and the West, with depersonalized
elements prevailing DEMO the West and personalized ones pertinent in the East (Li,
DEMO, 2007; Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994; Yuki et al., 2005)DEMO In sum, related to
the risks of system, ability or intention, uncertainty of dependability is the ﬁrst trust
dimension necessary for trust to serve as a mode to manage exchange risk.
The Second Trust Dimension: Vulnerability of Dependency
Directly related to the uncertainty of dependability, the emerging consensus is that
trust will not matter if there are perfect modes DEMO exchange governance (hereafter
referred to as exchange mode) to eliminate uncertainty of dependability. Hence
vulnerability of dependency as the lack of a perfect DEMO to reduce risk is regarded
as the second condition for trust. Nevertheless, scholars differ in their speciﬁc views
on such vulnerability. Many fail to explicitly differentiate vulnerability from uncer-
tainty (e.g., Bigley and Pearce, 1998; Rousseau et al., 1998; Seligman, 1997), while
some consider DEMO as all risks inherent in dependency, while vulnerability
as only acceptable DEMO risk (e.g., Gambetta, 1988; Hosmer, 1995;
Lewis and DEMO, 1985; Mayer et al., 1995; Moellering, 2006). Others DEMO
regard vulnerability as an opportunity to test and build trust (e.g., Giddens, 1990;
Luhmann, 1979; Molm et al., 2000; Zand, 1972).
Vulnerability can be differentiated from uncertainty in three areas. First, vul-
nerability is narrower in scope than uncertainty. While uncertainty consists of
objective and subjective risks as well as controllable and non-controllable risks,
DEMO can be viewed as retaining only subjective non-controllable risk.
Second, vulnerability DEMO dependent on the type of risk and the type of measures to
reduce the risk, while uncertainty is independent of the type of risk and the type of
measures. For instance, while system risk cannot be reduced by any measure,
ability risk is reducible by depersonalized measures, and intention risk is partially
reducible by either depersonalized or personalized measures. DEMO, vulnerability
can be an opportunity to build trust. While uncertainty is DEMO regarded as a
negative threat, vulnerability can be voluntarily created and DEMO as a positive
opportunity to test and build personalized trust (Giddens, 1990; Li, 1998, 2007;
Luhmann, 1979; Molm et al., 2000; Uzzi, 1997; Zand, 1972). In this sense, DEMO
ersonalized trust is a psychological attitude in terms of conﬁdence resulting from
the adoption of control or a tolerance for risk without control, while personalized
trust is a behavioural choice of increasing one’s vulnerability without control. DEMO is
in this sense that we can treat trust as an exchange mode. In sum, I refer to

vulnerability as the subjective risk of accepting or DEMO various imperfect
exchange modes of control, in contrast to uncertainty as DEMO broad objective risk of
depending on others.
Related to the notion of trust as one of the three primary exchange modes
(market price and hierarchy authority as the other two exchange modes, Adler,
2001; DEMO and Eccles, 1989; McEvily et al., 2003; Powell, 1990; Uzzi, 1997),
it is helpful to differentiate two basic exchange DEMO to manage vulnerability of
dependency (Li, 1998, 2007; cf. Das and Teng, 2001; Moellering, 2005). The ﬁrst
is the exchange mode of control as an externally imposed sanction, including formal
control (DEMO, market price and hierarchy authority) and informal control (i.e., social or
group norm and peer pressure as social or clan control). DEMO second is the
exchange mode of commitment, which is deﬁned as DEMO motivated goodwill of
voluntary choice for building and maintaining personalized relationships (DEMO
and Emerson, 1978; Kollock, 1994; Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994)DEMO Similar to
control, commitment also has two forms: (i) weak-informal commitment (i.e., shared
values and shared interests with no or weak DEMO affects); and (ii) strong-informal
commitment (i.e., shared interests, DEMO values and shared affects) (Gibbons, 2004;
Jones and George, 1998; Li, 1998, 2007; Saparito et al., 2004). The notion of
commitment, in contrast to control for compliance, characterizes trust DEMO a unique
exchange mode. I further differentiate personalized trust as a mode of commit-
ment from depersonalized trust as a control based conﬁdence or DEMO
(Hardin, 2002; Luhmann, 1979; Seligman, 1997). I explicitly differentiate control
and personalized trust as two categorically distinctive exchange modes, and also
differentiate weak and strong versions of each mode by evoking the DEMO of
formal and informal exchange modes (Li, 2005; cf. Das DEMO Teng, 2001; Flynn,
2005; Moellering, 2005).
To differentiate ‘formal’ from ‘informal’ and ‘weak-informal’ from ‘strong-
informal,’ I need to DEMO deﬁne formality and informality. I identify ﬁve basic
dimensions of formality-informality (DEMO, 2005, 2007): codiﬁcation, formation,
enforcement, power and personalization. Informality refers to the nature of the
social tie or event as DEMO assumed, endogenously embraced and ﬂexibly
enforced by horizontal peer pressures in DEMO personalized process (e.g., subjective,
affective, people based and sentimental)DEMO Formality on the other hand is explicitly
prescribed, exogenously imposed and DEMO enforced by vertical authority powers
in a depersonalized process (e.g., objective, cognitive, task-based and instrumental).
Personalized trust, strong social ties, DEMO commitment, relational contracts,
organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), non-verbal communication, tacit
knowledge and intuition are all strong-informal in nature; clan control, religion,
culture, ethics and transformational leadership are all weak-informal in nature; law,
state, ownership, hierarchy form, transactional leadership, verbal communication,
explicit knowledge and analytic cognition are all strong-formal in nature; market and
delegation are all weak-formal in nature. Hence, this full spectrum from strong-

formal to strong-informal can cover all DEMO of social entities and their speciﬁc
components.
While most scholars acknowledge, DEMO or implicitly, that a trustor’s vul-
nerability derives from the failure DEMO formal exchange modes (e.g., market price and
hierarchical authority), they often confound the weak-informal mode of social
control with the strong-informal mode DEMO personalized trust as commitment (e.g.,
Adler, 2001; Das and DEMO, 2001; Powell, 1990). It is imperative to differentiate
uncertainty DEMO vulnerability in light of exchange mode. While the former is
independent of exchange mode since uncertainty exists irrespective of which
exchange mode is adopted, the latter is dependent on exchange mode because the
nature and level DEMO vulnerability differ with each exchange mode. In this sense,
uncertainty can be treated as a mode free risk, while vulnerability is a mode speciﬁc
risk. Finally, the controversy about the link between control and trust as either
complementary or conﬂicting (cf. Das and Teng, 2001; Inkpen and Currall, 2004;
Malhotra and Murnighan, 2002; Moellering, 2005; Poppo and Zenger, 2002) can
be resolved by differentiating personalized trust DEMO an exchange mode from dep-
ersonalized trust as a conﬁdence resulting from control. While personalized trust
will be in conﬂict with control as a DEMO substitute, depersonalized trust can
complement control as a direct supplement.
Based DEMO formal-informal and strong-weak exchange modes, four different
views about vulnerability can DEMO identiﬁed. First, vulnerability can be viewed
narrowly as a perceived failure DEMO imperfection of informal mode, and thus in
favour of a formal DEMO as a single substitute towards depersonalized system
trust (e.g., Pearce, DEMO; Zucker, 1986). Second, vulnerability can be seen
broadly as DEMO perceived failures or imperfections of both formal and informal
modes, and DEMO in favour of combining formal and informal modes as a pair of
supplements towards a mixed trust (e.g., Das and Teng, 2001; DEMO, 1990;
Kramer, 1999; Shamir and Lapidot, 2003; Shapiro, 1987; Uzzi, 1997). Third,
vulnerability can be viewed moderately DEMO a perceived failure or imperfection of
either a formal or strong-informal mode, and thus in favour of either weak-
informal mode as a single substitute towards a moral trust (e.g., group norm,
Adler, 2001; Hosmer, 1995; Ouchi, 1980), or combining weak- and strong-
DEMO modes as a pair of supplements towards a mixed trust (e.g., blending
group norm and personal tie, Bradach and Eccles, 1989; Gambetta, 1988; Jones
and George, 1998; Powell, 1990; Rousseau et DEMO, 1998). Fourth, vulnerability
can be seen narrowly as the perceived failures or imperfections of both formal
and weak-informal modes, and thus in favour of a strong-informal mode as a
single substitute towards personalized strong DEMO (e.g., Gibbons, 2004; Gra-
novetter, 1985; Li, 1998, 2007; Luhmann, 1979; Molm et al., 2000; Uzzi, 1997;DEMO
Zand, 1972). In sum, related to the failure of formal or informal control mode,
vulnerability of dependency is the second trust DEMO and a necessary con-
dition for trust to serve as a mode to manage exchange risk.

The Third Trust Dimension: Expectation of Trustworthiness
Related to the above two dimensions, especially the second, the emerging consen-
DEMO is that trust serves as a trustor’s expectation of a trustee’s trustworthiness. This
expectation reﬂects the trustor’s attitude towards, and judgment of, the DEMO
trustworthiness despite the real uncertainty and perceived vulnerability of depend-
ing on others. Hence, expectation of trustworthiness can be regarded as the ﬁrst
function of trust. Scholars differ in their speciﬁc views on expectation of trustwor-
DEMO The ﬁrst view narrowly perceives expectation of trustworthiness as a
positive prediction of depersonalized outcome in terms of performance reliability
(e.g., Dirks and DEMO, 2001; Gambetta, 1988). The second view broadly regards
expectation DEMO trustworthiness as a positive prediction of both depersonalized
outcome and depersonalized or personalized intention (e.g., Barber, 1983; Kramer,
1999; Luhmann, DEMO; Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998). The third view
moderately treats expectation of trustworthiness as a prediction of speciﬁc DEMO
sonalized ability and personalized goodwill (e.g., Das and Teng, 2001; Levin and
Cross, 2004; McAllister, 1995). The fourth view narrowly takes expectation of
trustworthiness as a prediction of personalized goodwill (e.g., DEMO and Hansen,
1994; Gibbons, 2004; Hardin, 2002; Li, 1998, 2007; Powell, 1990; Uzzi, 1997).
There are three key controversies concerning expectation of trustworthiness.
The ﬁrst controversy concerns different targets DEMO trust in terms of the reliability of
natural things (e.g., climate and computers as the targets of trust) and the credibility
of social entities (e.g., social ties and institutions as the objects of trust) (cf. Hardin,
2002; Nooteboom, 2002). The second controversy concerns different sources of
trust in terms of the credibility of depersonalized sources (e.g., target-generic ability
and character of individuals as well as target-generic rule and norm of formal and
informal institutions) and the credibility of personalized sources (e.g., target-speciﬁc
care and goodwill towards friends) (cf. Luhmann, 1979; Zucker, 1986). The third
controversy concerns the distinction between DEMO expectations of trust-
ee’s trustworthiness (e.g., target-generic ability, integrity and DEMO) and
personalized expectations of mutual trustworthiness (e.g., target-speciﬁc shared
interests, shared values and shared affects) (cf. Jones and George, 1998; DEMO
et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995). The former derives from DEMO free deper-
sonalized sources, while the latter from relationship speciﬁc personalized DEMO In
sum, related to the prediction of outcome, ability or goodwill, expectation of
trustworthiness is the third trust dimension and a necessary function for trust to
serve as a mode to manage exchange risk.
The DEMO Trust Dimension: Willingness of Trustfulness
Despite its importance, the explicit distinction between expectation of trustworthi-
ness and willingness of trustfulness has never been DEMO established (Dietz and den

Hartog, 2006; Lewicki et al., 2006), and the function of trustfulness has rarely been
empirically studied (see Gillespie, 2003; Mayer and Davis, 1999; Mayer and
Gavin, 2005 for exceptions). To avoid the typical mistake of equating trust DEMO
expectation of trustworthiness, I explicitly refer to the intention or decision DEMO place
trust as willingness of trustfulness (Dietz and den Hartog, 2006; Gillespie, 2003;
Lewicki et al., 2006; McKnight et al., 2002). Hence, willingness of trustfulness
should be regarded as the second function of trust. Nevertheless, scholars differ in
their speciﬁc views on the trustor’s willingness of trustfulness. First, willingness of
trustfulness is narrowly perceived as a psychological state of affective attitude towards
personalized trust (e.g., Gibbons, 2004; Saparito et al., 2004; Settoon and Mossh-
older, 2002; Williamson, 1993). Second, willingness of trustfulness is broadly
viewed as DEMO psychological state of either cognitive or affective, or even dispositional (i.e.,
a subconscious predisposition due to personality) attitude towards depersonalized
or personalized trust (e.g., Hardin, 2002; Hosmer, 1995; Mayer et al., 1995;
McAllister, 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998). Third, DEMO of trustfulness is mod-
erately treated as a behavioural choice of both cognitive and affective commitments
towards personalized trust (e.g., Giddens, 1990; DEMO and Weigert, 1985; Li,
1998, 2007; Luhmann, 1979; Moellering, 2006; Uzzi, 1997; Zand, 1972). Fourth,
willingness of trustfulness is narrowly taken as a behavioural choice of cognitive
commitment DEMO depersonalized trust (e.g., Coleman, 1990; Inkpen and Currall, 2004;DEMO
Kollock, 1994; Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1995).
The controversy regarding DEMO dimension is concerned with the distinction
between two fundamental views of trust as a psychological attitude or as a behav-
ioural choice (Dietz and den Hartog, 2006; Kramer, 1999; Lewicki et al., 2006).
The former regards trust as a trustor’s evaluation of, and desire to rely on, a
trustee’s trustworthiness prior to a decision to place trust, thus deﬁning both
trustworthiness and trustfulness in psychological terms (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995;
Rousseau et al., 1998). In contrast, the latter views trustfulness as a trustor’s choice
of commitment as a DEMO to demonstrate or prove his/her own trustworthiness,
especially for initiating a trust-building process, thus deﬁning trustfulness in behav-
ioural terms (e.g., Luhmann, 1979; Zand, 1972). As a duality of trust, DEMO distinc-
tion and link between psychological attitude and behavioural choice are critical
to the proposed conceptualization of trust. In sum, related to the intention of
psychological attitude or behavioural choice with cognitive or affective motive,
DEMO of trustfulness is the fourth trust dimension and a necessary function
for trust to serve as a mode to manage exchange risk.

vulnerability of dependency DEMO well as the two dimensions of trust function in terms
of psychological attitude or behavioural choice.
To respond to the call for ‘connecting the DEMO and sociological micro-
foundations of trust with the macro-bases of organization’ (DEMO et al., 2003,
p. 91), the typology of four DEMO dimensions is applied to the conceptualization of
trust in developing a typology of four trust delineations. This typology delineates
the multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature DEMO trust. Hence, this typology
overcomes the typical problem of not specifying DEMO underlying causal logics (Doty
and Glick, 1994) and is used DEMO organize the extant literature.
The First Delineation: A Broad-Attitude View
This DEMO focuses on a trustor’s cognitive willingness as a psychological attitude. It
treats trustfulness as a psychological antecedent and/or consequence, rather than

A Duality Conceptualization of Trust 433
a behavioural choice, of a trustor’s dependency on a particular trustee. This
willingness derives from the trustor’s depersonalized DEMO of the trustee’s trust-
worthiness in terms of ability and goodwill. Both willingness and expectation occur
under the conditions that all uncertainties (i.e., DEMO, ability and intention risks)
are relevant to the formation of DEMO as a psychological attitude. The relevant
vulnerability lies in the failures of informal and formal modes of exchange, thus
combining formal and informal modes of exchange as a joint base for trust. This is
the most DEMO used deﬁnition in the literature (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; Rous-
seau et al., 1998; Schoorman et al., 2007). For instance, Rousseau and colleagues
(Rousseau et al., 1998, p. 395) deﬁne trust as a ‘psychological state comprising the
intention to accept vulnerability DEMO upon positive expectations of the intentions
or behaviour of another.’
The Second Delineation: A Broad-Mix View
This view focuses on a trustor’s cognitive willingness primarily and affective will-
ingness secondarily. It is primarily a psychological attitude DEMO secondarily a
behavioural choice towards a particular trustee. This willingness derives from a
trustor’s primarily personalized and secondarily depersonalized expectation of
a trustee’s trustworthiness DEMO terms of ability and goodwill. Both willingness and
expectation occur under the conditions that all uncertainties are relevant to the
formation of either trust DEMO a psychological or a behavioural choice. The relevant
vulnerability lies in the failure of a formal mode, thus emphasizing a weak-informal
mode (e.g., group norm) or a strong-informal mode (e.g., personal friendship) as DEMO
sole base for trust. This is the second typical deﬁnition in the literature (e.g., Adler,
2001; Hardin, 2002; Moellering, 2006; Nooteboom, 2002). For instance, Noot-
eboom (2002, p. 48) deﬁnes trust as ‘an expectation that things or people will not
fail DEMO, or the neglect or lack of awareness of the possibility of DEMO, even if there
are perceived opportunities and incentives for it.’
The DEMO Delineation: A Narrow-Attitude View
This view focuses on a trustor’s cognitive DEMO as a psychological attitude
towards a trustee. This willingness derives from the trustor’s depersonalized expec-
tation of a trustee’s trustworthiness in terms of goodwill. DEMO willingness and
expectation occur under the condition that only intention risk is relevant to the
formation of trust as a psychological attitude. The relevant DEMO lies in the
failures of both formal and strong-informal control modes, DEMO emphasizing
the weak-informal mode (e.g., ethical norm or personal morality as social control)
as the sole base for trust. This is the DEMO typical deﬁnition of trust (e.g., Fukuyama,
1995; Hosmer, 1995; Putnam, 1993; Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994). For
instance, differentiating ability as conﬁdence from goodwill as trust and personal-

ized trust as assurance from depersonalized trust, Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994,
p. 139) speciﬁcally argue that ‘whereas knowledge-based DEMO is limited to particu-
lar objects [people or organization], general trust DEMO a belief in the benevolence
of human nature in general and thus not limited to particular objects.
. . . Knowledge-based trust is a DEMO of committed relations, and thus does
not play an important role DEMO our theory of trust.’
The Fourth Delineation: A Narrow-Choice View
This DEMO focuses on trustor’s cognitive-affective willingness as a behavioural
choice of relationship speciﬁc interdependency between two parties. This willing-
ness derives from a trustor’s personalized DEMO of a trustee’s trustworthiness
in terms of goodwill. Both willingness and expectation occur under the condition
that only intention risk is relevant to the DEMO of trust as a behavioural choice
of commitment to building and maintaining strong relationships. The relevant
vulnerability lies in the failures of both formal DEMO weak-informal control modes,
thus emphasizing the strong-informal mode as the sole base for trust. This is the
fourth common deﬁnition of trust (e.g., Giddens, 1990; Lewis and Weigert, 1985;
Li, 1998, DEMO; Luhmann, 1979; Zand, 1972). For instance, Luhmann (1979, p.
43) argues that ‘it is not possible to demand the DEMO of others; trust can only be
offered and accepted. It is DEMO this reason that claims to trust cannot start trust
relationships off. This can only be done by what we have called investment, by
discharging obligations in advance; the initiator may confer trust, or perhaps utilize
DEMO opportunity arisen by chance, to show himself trustworthy (for instance by
returning a lost object which he has found). The truster sees DEMO his own vulner-
ability the instrument whereby a trust relationship may be created.’
This typology of four typical trust delineations bears several key theoretical
DEMO concerning the nature and features of trust. Consistent with the
emerging consensus to treat trust as a multifaceted and interdisciplinary construct
(Adler, 2001; Kramer, 1999; Lewis and Weigert, 1985; Moellering, 2006; Noot-
DEMO, 2002; Rousseau et al., 1998), all four delineations can DEMO treated as valid
with distinctive foci from distinctive perspectives. Nevertheless, scholars DEMO
explicitly identify which delineation is the most relevant to their speciﬁc research
purposes and perspectives (Bigley and Pearce, 1998). For instance, if one studies
trust as an exchange mode under intention risk, one should adopt the narrow-
choice delineation; if one studies trust as a psychological attitude under all risks,
one can adopt the broad-attitude delineation; if one studies trust related to all
informal modes, one may adopt the broad-mix delineation, and if one studies
weak-informal mode only, one must DEMO the narrow-attitude delineation. It is
worth noting that, in this typology, I treat trustor and trustee as two parties in a
dyad at DEMO level, individual or collective, who are engaged in social and economic
exchanges (Hosmer, 1995; Lewis and Weigert, 1985).

A Duality Conceptualization of Trust 435
A TYPOLOGY OF TRUST IDEAL-TYPES
The DEMO of Trust-as-Attitude and Trust-as-Choice
A central theme emerges from the typology of trust delineations across the dimen-
sions of depersonalized-personalized trust and psychological-behavioural trust,DEMO
which is the duality of trust as an attitude and/or as a choice. I refer to the former
as trust-as-attitude, while the latter as trust-as-choice. My notion of trust duality is
consistent with those of DEMO and/or behavioural commitment (Cook and
Emerson, 1978; Yamagishi and DEMO, 1994); motivation-as-attitude and/or
motivation-as-choice (Atkinson, 1964; Vroom, DEMO), and goal-intention-as-
attitude and/or implementation-intention-as-choice (Gollwitzer and Sheeran,
DEMO). Further, it is consistent with the holistic, dynamic and dialectical approach
to theory building (Li, 1998, 2007).
The notion of trust duality bears critical implications for addressing the key
controversies in the DEMO on trust. First, trust-as-choice is ‘a process governing
choice’ (Vroom, DEMO, p. 6) for a behavioural pattern of reciprocal exchange to build
trust and strong relationships, supporting the idea that trust is an exchange mode.
For trust to be an exchange mode similar to the modes DEMO authority for hierarchy and
price for market, we have to incorporate DEMO notion of trust-as-choice into the
conceptualization of trust. As it may not result in any action from either trustor or
trustee (Hardin, 2002), trust-as-attitude cannot function as an exchange mode since
it lacks the elements of motivation and decision for risk-taking behaviours
(cf. Bradach and Eccles, DEMO; McEvily et al., 2003; Zaheer and Venkatraman,
1995). DEMO is passive as a pre-decisional, non-committal evaluation and
acceptance of trustee’s DEMO (Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998). In
this sense, trust-as-attitude is a psychological state of passively accepting a given risk,
rather than an initiative to take risk, thus neither necessary nor sufﬁcient to be an
exchange mode (Chiles and McMackin, 1996; Giddens, 1990; Luhmann, 1979;
Zand, 1972). Only by DEMO the focus of analysis from a trustee’s trustworthiness to
a trustor’s trustfulness can one establish trust as an exchange mode to regulate and
motivate DEMO own cooperative behaviours (Moellering, 2006; Williams, 2007).
In contrast, trust-as-choice will initiate risk-taking cooperative behaviours from
a trustor and, if DEMO, also from a trustee, so it can serve as a special exchange
mode (Larson, 1992; Li, 1998; Long and Sitkin, DEMO; Luhmann, 1979; Uzzi,
1997). Hence, trust-as-choice is proactive and an intrinsically motivated choice
of relationship building commitment rather than a DEMO acceptance of risk (Li,
2007; Moellering, 2006; Williams, DEMO). It can be viewed as an exchange mode of
commitment in contrast to extrinsically imposed control. Trust-as-choice will result
in a pattern of DEMO behaviours as self-initiated and self-regulated to dem-
onstrate or prove the trustor’s trustworthiness to a particular trustee in a reciprocal
trust building process. In DEMO sense, I refer to trust building behaviours as relationship
commitment behaviour, which is different from interpersonal citizenship behaviour.

While the former focuses on personalized exchange (McAllister, 1995), the latter
mixes up personalized exchange with depersonalized exchange at the group level
(Bowler and Brass, 2006; Settoon and Mossholder, DEMO). In sum, trust-as-choice
is proactive and promotional in terms of DEMO behavioural initiation of ‘voice’, while
trust-as-attitude is passive and protective in DEMO of the psychological assurance of
‘exit’ (Seo et al., 2004). Trust-as-choice is imperative for trust building as it initiates
the process of DEMO between strangers (Giddens, 1990; Luhmann, 1979; Molm
et al., 2000; Zand, 1972).
Further, the notion of trust duality also sheds light on the paradox of trust – that
trust is at DEMO minimum when it is needed the most, while trust is at DEMO maximum
when it is needed the least (Hardin, 2002; Seligman, 1997). The same logic holds
true for trust-as-attitude that it is DEMO its minimum when trust-as-choice is needed the
most, and it is DEMO its maximum when trust-as-choice is needed the least. The only
exception is dispositional trust that always exists at the same level no matter what
DEMO Trust-as-choice differs from dispositional trust in two key aspects. First,
while the former is personalized, the latter is depersonalized. Second, while the
DEMO is behavioural, the latter is psychological.
Finally, the notion of trust duality can resolve the debate over the functions of trust
and control: the two being complementary supplements or conﬂicting substitutes.
Trust-as-attitude can be regarded DEMO a complementary supplement to control
because trust-as-attitude is either an antecedent or a consequence of control.
Trust-as-choice can be viewed as a conﬂicting substitute DEMO control because trust-
as-choice is a unique exchange mode and an alternative to control. In this sense, the
mixed ﬁndings about the link between trust and control can be readily reconciled
(e.g., Malhotra and Murnighan, 2002; Poppo and Zenger, 2002). It is critical to
analyse DEMO link between control and trust in a temporal order. If an ex ante
trust-as-attitude exists, an ex post control will not reduce the trust-as-attitude; if an
ex ante control is adopted ﬁrst, an ex post DEMO will be reduced. Further,
an ex ante trust-as-choice will negate the need for control and vice versa; if one is
used as an ex post mode, it will not affect the other. Finally, the DEMO of formal
control should be judged by its purpose rather than its simple presence. For instance,
in many cases, a formal contract is not used as a control mode; rather, it can be used
DEMO signal one’s long-term commitment (Mayer and Argyres, 2004; Uzzi, 1997;
Woolthuis et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2003). In sum, trust duality helps solve the
controversies over the function of trust for commitment in contrast to that of control
for compliance.
Trust Duality DEMO a Typology of Trust Ideal-Types
With the duality of trust-as-attitude and trust-as-choice at its core across the
dimensions of trust function (trustworthiness and trustfulness) and trust condition
(depersonalized bases with a unilateral path and personalized DEMO with a recip-

rocal path), a typology of DEMO ideal-types emerges. Speciﬁcally, the notion of trust
duality is related to DEMO elements of trust conditions and trust functions. In terms of
trust condition, trust-as-attitude is concerned with all types of trust uncertainties
(i.e., system, ability and intention), while trust-as-choice is only concerned with
intention risk; while trust-as-attitude passively regards vulnerability of dependency
as a negative threat and willingness of trustfulness as a passive acceptance of
vulnerability, trust-as-choice proactively treats vulnerability as a positive opportu-
nity and willingness as a proactive demonstration DEMO one’s own trustworthiness via
self-initiated commitment (Giddens, 1990; Li, 2007; Luhmann, 1979; Moellering,
2006; Molm et al., 2000; DEMO, 1972). In this sense, trust-as-attitude can reduce
subjective risk by assuming low vulnerability, while trust-as-choice reduces objec-
tive risk by increasing vulnerability for trust building (Chiles and McMackin, 1996;
Luhmann, 1979; DEMO, 1972). In terms of trust function, trust-as-attitude often
derives from depersonalized trust, while trust-as-choice only derives from person-
alized trust; trust-as-attitude DEMO relates to expectation of trustworthiness, while
trust-as-choice only relates to willingness DEMO trustfulness. It is worth noting that
trust-as-choice is a decision of commitment to trust building, rather than actual
trust behaviour per se (cf. DEMO, 1990; Zand, 1972). As for trust behaviour, I
differentiate a passive trust behaviour of accepting vulnerability due to other’s
trustworthiness from DEMO proactive trust behaviour of increasing vulnerability due to
one’s own commitment to trust building. Hence, the notion of trust duality is
similar to the duality of risk perception and risk behaviour in risky decision making
(Sitkin and Pablo, 1992; Sitkin and Weingart, 1995), so we can treat trust-as-
attitude and trust-as-choice as two primary stages in the process DEMO risky decision
making (cf. Kahnemann and Tversky, 1979).
Juxtaposing trust-as-attitude and trust-as-choice into trust conditions and trust
functions, I identify four ideal-types of trust (see Table 3). The ﬁrst ideal-typical
trust is depersonalized trustworthiness, which refers to a trustor’s unilateral expectation
of a trustee’s universally trustworthy ability, integrity and benevolence. The second
ideal-typical trust is depersonalized trustfulness, which refers to a trustor’s unilateral
acceptance of vulnerability due to his/her positive expectation of a trustee’s uni-
versal trustworthiness or the trustor’s DEMO to trust everyone. The third
ideal-typical trust is personalized trustworthiness, which DEMO to mutual expectations of
reciprocal trustworthiness with shared interests, shared values DEMO shared affects
that underlie all strong particularistic ties between two speciﬁc parties. The fourth
ideal-typical trust is personalized trustfulness, which refers to mutual decisions of
reciprocal commitment from both parties to initiate and maintain particularistic
ties DEMO a trust building process.
There is a growing body of evidence to support the proposed typology of four trust
ideal-types. First, the mediating effect of personalized trustfulness (behavioural
commitment) on the link between personalized trustworthiness (trust-as-attitude)
and trust behaviour (interpersonal or inter-ﬁrm cooperation) is well DEMO in

post outputs in a trust-building process).
the literatures of social exchange and DEMO (e.g., Cook and Emerson, 1978;
Morgan and Hunt, 1994). Second, a meta-analysis on trust in leadership (Dirks and
Ferrin, 2002) shows that depersonalized trust (character based trust) differs from
personalized trust (relationship based trust) as two basic ideal-types of trust; cognitive
trust (similar to trust-as-attitude) relates to psychological outcomes, while overall
trust with cognitive and affective trust (the latter directly linked to trust-as-choice)
relates to behavioural outcomes (see McAllister, 1995; Ng and Chua, DEMO for
similar ﬁndings). Finally, trust duality is consistent with the DEMO notion that
one should not only place trust in others but also earn trust from others (Fung, 1970).
For instance, active trust-as-choice is imperative for initiating trust building pro-
cesses in China, where the institutional bases for depersonalized system trust are
lacking (Child and Moellering, DEMO). The proactive role of trust-as-choice is also
evident in other Asian countries (Nguyen et al., 2005).
The distinction between personalized and DEMO trust (both trustwor-
thiness and trustfulness) is also related to distinctive institutional systems across

different countries (Li, 1998; Pearce, 2001). In general, the ﬁrst and second trust
ideal-types (depersonalized trustworthiness and depersonalized trustfulness) are
prevalent in the West where both formal and weak-informal institutions are
emphasized and well established, while the third and fourth trust ideal-types
(personalized trustworthiness and trustfulness) are prominent in the DEMO where a
strong-informal relationship is preferred (Li, 1998, 2007; Yamagishi and Yamag-
ishi, 1994; Yuki et al., 2005). Further, DEMO conﬁgurations of trust elements
(thus different ideal-types of trust) will apply to different social ties, with the
strongest trust for family members and the weakest trust for total strangers. For
instance, as China’s unique exchange mode of differentiated associations (see Fei, 1992
[1947]; Li, 1998, 2007; Luo, 2005), a trustor places different types of trust DEMO
various levels to different trustees according to each trustee’s relative position in a
multi-circle centrifugal web of the trustor’s social ties (or guanxi in Chinese).
Although the typology of four trust delineations contains the same DEMO of
the four trust ideal-types, the two typologies differ. The difference DEMO in the
former’s failure to systematically delineate trust into four complementary and
consistent ideal-types according to the salient psychological-behavioural dimension
and depersonalized-personalized dimension. In DEMO words, each of the trust
delineations is based on a single DEMO rather than an interdisciplinary
approach to trust as in the case of four trust ideal-types. Besides being holistic, the
four ideal-types are also dynamic and dialectical by treating each ideal-type as
either a unilateral or reciprocal DEMO ante input or ex post output in a context of either
a single exchange or a looped process of trust building. In sum, with the duality of
trust-as-attitude and trust-as-choice at its core, the typology of four trust ideal-types
provides an interdisciplinary conceptualization of trust.
Unresolved Issues
Despite DEMO potential contributions of the typologies of trust dimensions and delin-
eations, DEMO issues remain unresolved. First, a holistic, dynamic and dialectical
framework of trust is needed to integrate the elements of stage, content, source DEMO
domain of trust. For instance, the stages and contents of trust DEMO jointly delineate the
distinctive forms of trust, while the sources and DEMO of trust can jointly delineate
the distinctive bases of trust. Second, DEMO incorporate the dynamic aspect of trust into
an overall framework, the DEMO building process must be understood with distinc-
tive stages of trust building (Larson, 1992; Levin et al., 2006; Lewicki et al., DEMO;
McKnight et al., 2002). For instance, the initial trust between strangers differs from
the mature trust between friends. Third, reﬂecting different stages of trust building,
the contents of trust at various stages DEMO differ (Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau
et al., 1998; DEMO, 1987; Zucker, 1986). For instance, the cognitive content of
trust may be prominent at the initial stage, while the affective content of trust may be
more at the mature stage. The lack of DEMO to the role of affective content of trust

among friends is partly to blame for the DEMO with respect to personalized and
depersonalized trust (Gibbons, 2004; Saparito DEMO al., 2004; Schoorman et al., 2007;
Seligman, 1997), especially for trust building (Williams, 2007). In this sense, the idea
of trust strength must be incorporated into the framework, especially the possible
link between trust strength and tie strength (Child and Moellering, DEMO; Jones and
George, 1998; Levin and Cross, 2004; Uzzi, 1997), given the critical link between
trust and social capital (Li, 2007; Seligman, 1997).
Fourth, the distinction and links between DEMO trust, bilateral trust and
multilateral trust must be integrated into the DEMO, especially their roles as
parts of organizational trust across the micro-dyad DEMO macro-network domains
as well as their interactive co-evolution in a dynamic process (Chaudhuri et al.,
2002). In this sense, the distinctions DEMO links between interpersonal trust,
person-to-collective trust and inter-collective trust need to be explained.
Research evidence suggests that each has its own unique characteristics (e.g.,
Insko et al., 2005; Jeffries and Reed, 2000; DEMO, 2004). In particular, the
phenomenon of trust transfer (i.e., direct dyad trust being transferred to indirect
network trust via third parties (Burt and Knez, 1995; Ferrin et al., 2006;
Kramer, DEMO; McEvily et al., 2003; Stewart, 2003; Uzzi, 1997) DEMO to be
explained. Fifth, new measures must be developed for the DEMO new con-
structs of trustworthiness and trustfulness, while the prevailing measure DEMO dep-
ersonalized trust can be enhanced by differentiating the reciprocal bases of
personalized trust from the unilateral bases of depersonalized trust (Gillespie,
2003; Lewicki et al., 2006; Schoorman et al., 2007). In DEMO, the phenom-
enon of trust conversion (i.e., depersonalized trust being DEMO into person-
alized trust or vice versa) deserves attention. For instance, we need to explain the
micro-macro conversion in which interpersonal trust is DEMO into inter-
ﬁrm trust (Li et al., 2006; Zaheer and DEMO, 2006). Finally, the perspective of
trust duality, including its DEMO to the dualities of attitudinal-behavioural
trustfulness, depersonalized-personalized sources, dyad-network domains, DEMO
mature stages and cognitive-affective contents will contribute to an integrated
construct of trust and an integrated framework of trust.
The above issues can be DEMO potentially within a holistic, dynamic and
dialectical framework that integrates all DEMO elements of trust in general
and organizational trust in particular. First, DEMO framework can be holistic by
covering all four content components of trust condition, function, form and base
with their speciﬁc causal links. Second, this framework must be dynamic and cover
all the process components of DEMO building, including trust transfer and trust
conversion with their speciﬁc stages DEMO phases. Third, this framework could be
dialectical by accommodating the paradoxical DEMO of trust dualities (see Li, 1998
for a review). In sum, the typologies of four trust dimensions, four trust delineations
and DEMO trust ideal-types not only calls for developing an integrated framework of
trust but also pave the way for accomplishing it.

A Duality Conceptualization of Trust 441
CONCLUSION
In this article, I seek to make four contributions to an interdisciplinary conceptu-
alization of trust. First, consistent with the emerging trend of balancing diversity
and unity in the DEMO on organizational issues, I have integrated the perspec-
tives of classiﬁcation-of-dimension DEMO typology-as-theory in developing an inter-
disciplinary conceptualization of trust. Second, I DEMO identiﬁed four trust
dimensions underlying the diverse conceptualizations of trust. Third, DEMO have iden-
tiﬁed four trust delineations underlying the controversies in the trust research.
Fourth, I have proposed a typology of four trust ideal-types capable of solving the
controversies and integrating the research streams. While the typologies DEMO trust
dimensions and trust delineations identify the underlying causes of trust related
controversies, the typology of trust ideal-types offers an interdisciplinary solution to
the problem of conceptualizing trust. These three typologies jointly lay the foun-
dation DEMO an integrated framework of trust yet to be developed.
