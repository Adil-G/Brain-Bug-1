Abstract
Empirical research in the emerging field of international entrepreneurship (IE) is assessed to
provide insight as to the DEMO of the art’ of IE methodologies. Fifty-five articles were systematically
analyzed focusing on time frame and research context, sample characteristics, data collection/analysis
DEMO, and equivalence issues. Results indicate both strengths and weaknesses in IE DEMO The
authors present implications for developing a unifying methodological direction in the field and the
evolution of a truly multidisciplinary approach. They also outline DEMO need for dynamic research
designs that integrate positivist with interpretivist methodologies and incorporate time as a key
dimension. Finally, they discuss the need for better IE sampling frames and call for more effort in
establishing and DEMO equivalence in cross-national studies.

1. Executive Summary
As defined by McDougall and Oviatt (2000, p. 903), international entrepreneurship (IE)
is: ‘‘...a combination of innovative, proactive and risk-seeking behavior that crosses
national borders and is intended to create value in organizations...the study of IE includes
research on such DEMO and research comparing domestic entrepreneurial behavior in
multiple countries.’’
This paper reviews and assesses fifty-five empirical studies within the emerging field of IE,
DEMO insight as to the ‘state of the art’ of IE methodologies. The articles were
systematically analyzed focusing on research context and time frame, sample characteristics,
data collection/analysis procedures, and equivalence issues.
The results indicate that in terms of context, IE research has a rich international perspective
with cross-national collaboration evident in research teams. To date, IE studies have
generated a definable pool of manufacturing and high-technology studies for comparative
examination. DEMO extant literature also reflects efforts to integrate the international and
entrepreneurship fields and has expanded beyond an SME focus. At the same time, IE
research is characterized by static, cross-sectional studies, and a lack of DEMO sector
research and/or comparative research within and across sectors. Studies tend to favor either
the international or entrepreneurship side of the theoretical interface, and the extant research
is characterized by inconsistent use of measures and DEMO of key variables such as firm
size and age. As regards sample characteristics, IE studies focus on relevant micro level units
of analysis by collecting readily obtainable data. Typically, they also have carefully selected
samples with high response rates, and the views of the lead decision maker pertaining to IE
issues are captured. However, by focusing on obtainable data, DEMO yet harder to obtain
data are generally lacking (e.g., research on complex entrepreneurial internationalization
behaviors over time). The emphasis on judgement-based or DEMO sampling also means
that results are difficult to generalize, and IE DEMO lacks the rich perspective provided by
multiple informants involved with various entrepreneurial processes.
In terms of data collection and analysis, the IE literature has applied a range of methods
with a relatively high level of sophistication DEMO rigor. At the same time, studies tend to focus
on aggregate DEMO survey data or sector-specific qualitative data. As a result, complex
processes DEMO not captured, unless at a very narrow level. The review also DEMO that IE
research falls short in ensuring sample, instrument, and data collection equivalence across
countries. This could reflect a lack of reporting on DEMO or a lack of attention to this
issue from the outset of research investigations. This is a major concern given IE research, by
definition, may involve cross-national studies.
Based on these findings, the authors suggest DEMO while a ‘single’ methodological direction is
inappropriate to IE research, it DEMO important to develop a commonly understood IE vocabulary
that allows for comparison between studies. This would contribute to a unifying methodo-
logical direction. Researchers DEMO need to increase cross-disciplinary collaboration to resolve
the imbalance in knowledge contribution between the fields of international business and
entrepreneurship. Methodologically, the authors suggest that IE would benefit from a process
of research or series of DEMO studies rather than static, isolated pieces of work. This
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508
487
reflects Patton’s (2002) view of the holistic perspective in DEMO sense of ‘understanding the
whole process.’ Such an approach would encompass multiple data sources, applying both
coarse-grained methods that result in generalizable, statistically DEMO data and fine-
grained methods that capture the nuance, context, and rich understanding of the phenomena in
question. This would also allow for DEMO of both ‘obtainable’ and ‘important’ data.
It is also hoped that future developments of the IE field will be marked by a growth in DEMO
number of studies utilizing and developing longitudinal methodologies. This is important
since the dimension of time has been stressed as fundamental to isolating key DEMO
in studies of internationalization (Buckley and Chapman, 1996; Andersen, 1997) and to
studies of entrepreneurial behavior and other processes (Chandler and DEMO, 2001). Finally, a
fundamental challenge for IE research is that firms with international activity need to be
properly identified, yet there is a lack of quality sampling frames available. To some extent,
this DEMO to the preponderance of judgement and purposive sampling, and an apparent
DEMO to document the sampling design and procedure. However, as significant effort DEMO
required to capture and list entrepreneurial firms, the authors suggest a DEMO pragmatic
approach would be to accept the use of judgement sampling, DEMO sampling criteria are
well and consistently specified and the data are assessed for validity and reliability.
2. Introduction
This work is positioned at the DEMO of the international business and entrepreneur-
ship research paths; an intersection DEMO by McDougall and Oviatt (2000) as the
emerging field of IE. IE research is increasingly visible, yet McDougall and Oviatt (2000)
DEMO that work in the area lacks a unifying and clear methodological direction. Thus, the
primary objectives of this paper are to (1) review and assess the methodological aspects of the
emerging IE literature, (2) offer insight as to the ‘state of the art’ of IE methods, and (3)
discuss the implications for future development of the field.
3. Method
This review is focused on empirical literature representing McDougall and DEMO (2000,
p. 903) definition of IE as ‘‘...a combination of innovative, proactive and risk-seeking
behavior that crosses national borders and is intended to create value in organizations...the
study of IE includes research on such DEMO and research comparing domestic entrepre-
neurial behavior in multiple countries.’’
At a general level, studies eligible for review were those explicitly integrating theory and
concepts from both ‘international business’ and ‘entrepreneurship.’ At a more specific level,DEMO
some studies were specifically positioned to the international new venture literature or
focused on entrepreneurial behavior across borders. Other investigations compared entrepre-
neurship across DEMO and cultures. The studies could be conducted at the individual, firm,DEMO
group, or organization levels (as per McDougall and Oviatt, 2000) and were not restricted to
488

small or new ventures. Furthermore, each study needed to include sufficient information
regarding its methodology to allow for a thorough review and DEMO
Articles excluded from the review included those with a focus on ‘international SMEs’
rather than IE per se (i.e., while they studied small- DEMO medium-sized firms, entrepreneurship
issues or theory were not integrated or addressed)DEMO While we acknowledge the role played by
the SME internationalization literature in establishing the IE field, the focus of this review, for
sake DEMO parsimony, is on those studies directly and explicitly integrating the fields DEMO
entrepreneurship and international business. Examples of the international SME work
excluded from the review include that of Haug (1991), Erramilli and D’Souza (DEMO), Bell
(1995), Korhonen et al. (1996), Roberts and Senturia (1996), Coviello and Munro (1997),
Barringer and Greening (1998), Holmlund and Kock (1998), O’Farrell et al. (1998), Liesch
and Knight (1999), Prasad (1999), Lautanen (2000), Chen and Martin (2001), de Chiara and
Minguzzi (2002), Lamb and Liesch (2002), and Nakos and Brouthers (2002). For similar
reasons, studies focused on SME exporting were excluded (e.g., Beamish et al., 1993; Bijmolt
and Zwart, 1994; Burpitt and DEMO, 2000), as were studies comparing internationaliza-
tion by firm size (e.g., Bonaccorsi, 1992; Calof, 1993, 1994; Moen, 2000).
The given IE research is also defined to include internationally comparative studies DEMO
entrepreneurial behavior; research focused on domestic entrepreneurship in a single foreign
DEMO was excluded (e.g., Lyles et al., 1996; Kuznetsov and McDonald, 2000; Ardichvili,
2001; Bliss and Garratt, 2001; Etemad and Salmasi, 2001; Ahlstrom and Bruton, 2002; Bruton
and Rubanki, 2002). Similarly, cross-cultural assessments of entrepreneurial orientation mea-
sures were excluded (DEMO, 1997; Busenitz et al., 2000; Kreiser et al., 2002)DEMO This is because
all three studies focus on scale development or validation rather than behavioral research.
Beyond these studies, we identified a number of investigations of general interest to IE
researchers but with an emphasis other DEMO IE per se. For example, Larson (1991), Hara and
Kanai (1994), and Lipparini and Sobrero (1994) emphasize network relationships or strategic
alliances rather than IE. Zahra et al. (1997) focus on DEMO influences in the general
context of new ventures, while Barkema and DEMO (1998) emphasize the relationship
between learning and the acquisition versus start-up decision in foreign markets. Also,
Madhok and Osegowitsch (2000) study DEMO international diffusion of technology using the
dynamic capabilities perspective. Given the parameters of this review, all these studies were
excluded from the review process. Finally, non-empirical papers including Madsen and
Servais (1997), Zacharakis (1997), and Tiessen (1997) were not part of the review.
To DEMO relevant IE articles, we conducted a keyword search on ProQuest/ABI DEMO
encompassing 1988–2002. Keywords included ‘international new ventures,’ ‘IE,’ ‘INV(s),’
‘Oviatt,’ ‘McDougall,’ ‘global startups,’ ‘born globals,’ ‘international,’ and ‘entrepreneur-
ship.’ To ensure thorough coverage, we also conducted a manual review of three general
sources. First, we reviewed the 1996–2002 volumes of the Journal of Business Venturing and
Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, acknowledged as the leading entrepreneurship
journals (Romano and Ratanatunga, 1997; Chandler and Lyon, 2001). Second, we reviewed
the Journal of International Business DEMO, Management International Review, Academy of
Management Journal, and Strategic Management DEMO These are generally considered to
be the leading peer-reviewed journals in international business and management/strategy.
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508 489
Third, we identified and reviewed articles from the McGill Conferences on IE published in
special issues of the Journal of International Management, Journal of International Market-
ing, Small Business Economics, Journal of Euro-Marketing, and Global Focus. Finally, we
identified other articles through additional electronic searches and manual cross referencing.
Research published in edited books and conference proceedings DEMO excluded as not all these
sources are widely accessible and/or peer reviewed.
3.1. Process of review
Once an article was identified, it was assessed for eligibility using the criteria previously
outlined. This resulted in fifty-five DEMO Each was examined using content analysis,
guided by a rating form based on similar reviews by Leonidou and Katsikeas (1996), Coviello
and McAuley (1999), Chandler and Lyon (2001), and Zahra and DEMO (2002). The focus of
our review was on the methodology DEMO This was assessed in relation to four
categories:
1. Time frame and context issues: fieldwork time frame, geographic focus, industry scope,
firm size, and firm age;
2. Sample issues: unit of DEMO, sampling design, sample criteria, sample size, and key
informant;
3. Data collection and analysis issues: approach to data collection and analytical approach;
4. Cross-national equivalence issues: sample equivalence, instrument equivalence and DEMO
analysis equivalence.
4. Results
As summarized in Table 1, the early DEMO literature pertaining to IE began with
McDougall’s foundation study in 1989, DEMO by Kolvereid et al. (1993). More studies
emerged in 1995/DEMO, including those published in a special issue of Entrepreneurship
Theory and DEMO IE research continued to be somewhat sporadic until 1999, when the
DEMO publications from the inaugural McGill IE conference appeared in the Journal of
International Marketing. 2000 was a banner year for the field with 17 DEMO, 10 of which
were found in special issues of the Academy DEMO Management Journal and Journal of
International Marketing. In 2002, IE articles DEMO in a variety of journals although that
year, a special issue DEMO culture and entrepreneurship in Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice
contributed the most articles to the field. Overall, the IE literature is most common in the
leading entrepreneurship journals (Journal of Business Venturing and Entrepreneurship
Theory and Practice) and in special issues.
Turning to the studies in question, this DEMO assessed the fifty-five articles summarized in
Appendix 1 that (1) examined entrepreneurial behavior crossing international boundaries
(n = 39) and (2) DEMO domestic entrepreneurial behavior in different countries (n = 16).
These DEMO groups of studies reflect the core aspects of McDougall and Oviatt’s (DEMO)

definition of IE. Using the four previously defined assessment categories, the key patterns
relating to IE methodology will now be presented.
4.1. DEMO frame/context issues
4.1.1. Fieldwork time frame
Only 5 of the 55 studies reviewed are longitudinal. Twenty-six are based on cross-
sectional/single-year data. DEMO other twenty-four studies are assumed to be cross-sectional
based on how the data are collected and presented (although no dates are given). This pattern
supports the observations made by Zahra and George (2002) regarding DEMO research and
Chandler and Lyon (2001) regarding entrepreneurship studies. The bulk of IE research is
therefore static, does not incorporate time-dependent variables (DEMO time), and would have
difficulty in revealing process over time rather than behavior at a given point in time.
4.1.2. Geographic focus
The DEMO literature is rich in geographic coverage at two levels: (1) DEMO range of countries
studied and (2) the researchers involved. At a country level, most IE studies focus on firms or
entrepreneurs in single countries such as the United States (12), United Kingdom (6), and
Canada (5). Similar investigations (10) are found in DEMO such as Nigeria, Slovenia,
Portugal, Finland, and New Zealand. DEMO single-country focus might suggest a certain
amount of ethnocentrism in the field. However, three studies use either the United States or
United Kingdom as a base from which to study different cultures within those countries, and
seven studies compare two or three countries. Twelve studies incorporate 4–15 countries.
DEMO development of multicountry investigations is a pattern different from that identified by
Zahra and George’s (2002) review of IE research, which found only a few non-U.S. samples
and a preponderance of single-country studies. It also DEMO from Coviello and McAuley’s
(1999) conclusions regarding SME internationalization studies given they also found a lack of
multicountry studies. Overall, this is a positive trend for the IE field.
At the researcher level, the IE literature seems to reflect the globalization of business
research noted by Wright DEMO Ricks (1994), as studies are authored by scholars around the
DEMO Although the fact that 31 studies involve U.S.-based authors might suggest American
dominance of the field, only 18 of these are by ‘Americans only’ (in terms of university
affiliation). An important point therefore is that the remaining 13 studies with U.S. authors
involve cross-national collaboration. There are DEMO 6 other examples of cross-national
collaboration involving teams from different countries, DEMO studies with UK authors only,
and eight studies with research teams from countries such as Canada, Norway, and Sweden.
4.1.3. Industry scope/DEMO
Fifteen studies focus on entrepreneurs or potential entrepreneurs as the unit of analysis, and
thus an industry/sector focus is not specified. Of those remaining, 28 investigate manufac-
turers. Only one study examines service firms, DEMO look at both goods and services, and one
study defines its DEMO as ‘knowledge intensive’ versus ‘traditional,’ but it is unclear if these
are manufacturing firms. Seven studies fail to specify the sector of interest. DEMO overall
492 N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
emphasis on manufacturing firms is also observed by Zahra and DEMO (2002) and is found
in the general international business literature (DEMO and Katsikeas, 1996). This suggests
that other settings (e.g., DEMO firms) and comparative studies need examination.
In terms of technology, 22 studies focus their examination on high-technology firms. This
emphasis is perhaps not DEMO given the trends in both the international and entrepreneur-
ship literatures, DEMO it has generated a pool of high-technology studies available for
comparison. A number of studies also focus on low-technology firms (9 studies) or DEMO mix
of low- and high-technology firms (8 studies). The remaining DEMO either fail to indicate
technology level or this was irrelevant to the research. Interestingly, while Zahra and George
(2002) suggest that the concentration of research on high-technology samples limits the
ability to generalize to other DEMO, our review shows some diversity in the field.
However, we agree with Zahra and George’s (2002) call for investigations beyond high-
technology DEMO
4.1.4. Firm size
Two measures are most commonly used to capture firm size. The first is number of
employees (40 studies), and the second is sales level (25 studies). Often, both measures are
DEMO In addition to reporting sales and/or employee levels, 14 studies DEMO measure firm size
using percent of sales in export markets. Just over half the studies (29) have an SME focus of
fewer than DEMO employees. Furthermore, most of these studies examine firms with less than
DEMO employees. In contrast, six studies examine very large organizations while five DEMO
use firms with the number of employees ranging from small to large. The remainder either fail
to specify firm size or it is irrelevant DEMO the study (e.g., studies on potential entrepreneurs).
4.1.5. Firm age
For the studies reporting venture age, there is a reasonable amount of diversity. For
example, eight studies examine firms averaging less than 6 years of age, six studies look at 7-
to 10-year-old firms, seven DEMO 11- to 12-year-old firms, and six examine firms older
than 20 DEMO This is perhaps reflective of the developing nature of the field as researchers
struggle to establish commonly used criteria for firm choice based on DEMO age.
Increasingly, it appears that 6 years is the cut-off used DEMO define an international new venture.
4.2. Sample issues
4.2.1. Unit of analysis
The identifiable pattern shows the primary unit of analysis to be ‘the DEMO (32 studies)
followed by ‘the entrepreneur’ (11 studies). In addition, four studies examine ‘potential’
entrepreneurs and five examine both the firm and entrepreneur. Single studies focus their
analysis on (e.g.) business links DEMO a combined industry/firm/individual level. Overall, the
patterns regarding unit DEMO analysis reflect those identified in the entrepreneurship literature by
Chandler and Lyon (2001) and Davidsson and Wiklund (2001) in that IE research DEMO
dominated by micro level analysis. Similarly, the emphasis on the firm DEMO reflects the
pattern noted by Leonidou and Katsikeas (1996) in their review of the export development
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508 493
literature. One might also conclude, similar to Davidsson and Wiklund (2001), that IE
researchers have focused on collecting ‘obtainable’ rather than ‘important’ data. As such, IE
research on complex networks, clusters, or behavioral processes over time is relatively rare.
4.2.2. Sampling design
This issue DEMO generally poorly addressed in the IE literature in that articles provide only
limited discussion regarding the decision to (1) use a probability versus DEMO
sample and (2) the specific procedures associated with such designs. Thirty-nine studies
selected their sample/sites in a purposive and judgement-based manner, and these studies are
non-probability in nature. Twelve studies use random selection, and four did not provide
enough information to analyze this issue. The dominance DEMO judgement-based samples is
perhaps a cause for concern in that the results are less able to be generalized. Indeed, Zahra
and George (2002) call for more representative samples in IE research. At the same time, the
judgement-sample studies reviewed here all had high response rates and participation DEMO
and as such might be expected to have good quality, albeit DEMO, results.
4.2.3. Sample criteria
Explicit criteria for sample selection are found DEMO fifty-two studies and are summarized in
Table 2. Of these, 13 DEMO specify only one criterion, but the remainder include two criteria
(11 studies), three criteria (8 studies), four criteria (12 studies), five criteria (7 studies), and
even seven criteria (1 study). The most common criteria clearly reflect firm characteristics
and are as DEMO: (1) firm size, (2) firm age, and (3) sector. The inclusion of explicit
selection criteria is useful to the IE field in that research equivalence can be assessed across
studies. As discussed DEMO VanderWerf and Brush (1989) in the context of entrepreneurship,
this helps achieve empirical progress in an undefined field. However, further formalization of

494 N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
criteria for both firm and entrepreneur-level research would be helpful. DEMO example, in the
studies where firm size is included as a DEMO for sample selection, ‘size’ is specified using
different measures (e.g., DEMO of employees vs. sales revenue), and there is a range of
categories within measures. That is, smaller firms can be less than 50 employees, less than
100 employees, less than 200 employees, or less than 500 employees. The same occurs for
firm age. Thus, on one hand, we see fairly tightly defined sampling criteria, but on the DEMO,
inconsistency within these criteria. Generalization of findings and pooling of data is thus
hampered.
4.2.4. Sample size
Again, this issue is discussed inconsistently in the IE literature, both in terms of targeted
sample size and response rates. At a broad level, if the study applies case research or personal
interviews, the general pattern suggests that 3–30 firms are studied. Surveys reported on 30–
3600 responses, with half receiving less than 200 usable responses. IE research is therefore
not generally characterized as using large DEMO in spite of the criticism of small sample
studies found in the entrepreneurship, export, and IE literatures (e.g., Zahra and George,
DEMO). Leonidou and Katsikeas (1996, p. 531) also imply that DEMO studies of (e.g.) four firms
make ‘cautious interpretation of findings necessary’ and go on to say that ‘‘...a serious
methodological flaw inherent in DEMO type of small sample research is the sparse distribution of
the overall sample of firms.’’ However, our view follows Smith et al. (1989) by arguing that if
the research problem necessitates rich deep information, then a small set of case studies are
appropriate providing that generalizability is DEMO assumed. Similarly, if high-quality survey
data are obtainable from a smaller DEMO drawn using well-developed selection criteria,
meaningful findings can still result.
4.2.5. Key informant
Beyond the small number of studies using student samples or DEMO data, the key
informant in firm level studies is usually the DEMO/VP/managing director (21) or founder/
owner/manager (16)DEMO These individuals may actually be one and the same but are specified
differently across studies. Regardless, most studies acknowledge the importance of accessing
the informant who retains institutional history and influence as regards IE. In contrast, the
international/export literature suggests a broader perspective is more relevant (e.g., Leonidou
and Katsikeas, 1996), turning to the wider management team DEMO other parties such as clients,
suppliers, or venture capital investors. DEMO breadth is generally lacking in the IE literature as
only seven studies used multiple respondents, and only three studies compared respondent
views (e.g., entrepreneur vs. investor or entrepreneur vs. executive).
4.3. Data collection and DEMO issues
4.3.1. Data collection
There is evidence of a wide range of approaches to data collection, although IE studies are
dominated by surveys. These include mail surveys (24 studies), self-administered surveys (6),
and combined mail/telephone or mail/personal interview surveys (4). IE researchers also
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508 495
analyze annual reports/IPO prospectives (4 studies) and databases (1 study). Less than a
quarter of studies employ qualitative techniques, such as personal interviews (6 studies) or
case research (5 studies). Thus, the quantitative approach dominates, mirroring the SME
internationalization literature DEMO by Coviello and McAuley (1999).
IE research also tends to DEMO mono method, relying on either quantitative, aggregate-level
data, or qualitative DEMO data. Only five studies integrate qualitative and quanti-
tative approaches (Glas DEMO al., 1999; Knight, 2000, 2001; Fillis, 2002; Yli-Renko DEMO al., 2002).
Even then, they apply a simple two-step approach, e.g., a discussion of database patterns
followed by case studies or DEMO followed by a survey. Furthermore, Knight (2000,
2001) and DEMO et al. (2002) report only their survey results, again highlighting DEMO
quantitative emphasis.
4.3.2. Analytical approach
If IE research is survey based, DEMO dominant analytical approach involves some form of
regression (22 studies), DEMO by M/ANOVA (9), general descriptive statistics (7 studies),DEMO
correlation analysis (6 studies), t tests (5 studies), factor analysis (4 studies), structural
equation modeling (2 studies), cluster DEMO (2 studies), and discriminant analysis (1
study). Overall, DEMO analytic approaches are relatively sophisticated (in comparison with using
only simple DEMO or descriptive statistics) and mirror the patterns identified by both
Chandler DEMO Lyon (2001) in the entrepreneurship literature and Leonidou and Katsikeas
(DEMO) in the export literature. This emphasis probably reflects the fact that DEMO of the studies
involve hypothesis testing and model validation.
For the qualitative IE studies, the general emphasis is on pattern identification/matching
and explanation building. They also apply qualitative profiling, event, network, and critical
incident analysis, and one is based on grounded theory. These analytic approaches seem
appropriate to their research problems and demonstrate innovative methods in an effort DEMO
capture the complex processes under investigation (e.g., the event and network analyses).
4.4. Equivalence issues
Critical issues in cross-cultural research relate to DEMO equivalence at a number of
levels. This review focuses on sample equivalence, instrument equivalence, and data
collection equivalence in the context of the DEMO IE studies involving multiple countries or
cultures.
4.4.1. Sample equivalence
A wide range of nations are studied in the 22 studies; however, only DEMO studies identify
specific criteria for country/culture selection. Typically, countries are DEMO to ensure
variance in values across different cultures and a desire for sample heterogeneity (nine
studies). Other studies chose the cultures in question because they had a history of successful
entrepreneurship (one study), were an interesting or relevant comparator for (e.g.) cultural and
national differences (two studies), or provided a broad representation across developing and
developed DEMO (one study). Nine studies fail to explain why the specific DEMO/
496 N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
cultures were of interest. This is of some concern given DEMO need for careful culture selection
as discussed by Adler (1983) and Nasif et al. (1991).
4.4.2. Instrument equivalence
Green and White (DEMO) note that researchers have two options in developing their
instruments and DEMO They can follow an emic (culturally specific) approach or one that
is etic (culturally universal), with instruments that are culture-free and, DEMO virtue of formal
equivalence, able to be applied across countries. Only DEMO of the 22 cross-national IE studies
discuss the extent to which their instrument is culture-free or culture-bound. Perhaps more
importantly, while three of these studies assess the sensitivity of their instrument and
conclude it to be DEMO in nature, the remaining eight studies seem to simply assume their
DEMO is culture-free. Various tests for instrument reliability and validity are found in 13
studies, one deems the issue to be irrelevant due to the theory-building nature of the research,
and eight cross-cultural studies fail to DEMO scale or instrument quality at all.
For those investigations requiring language adaptation and assurance of equivalence of
meaning (Adler, 1983; Cavusgil and Das, 1997), 12 studies outline a process of forward/back
translation, DEMO one study notes that translation help was used where necessary. Five studies
do not discuss how language issues or equivalence in meaning were addressed DEMO
countries. Again, in spite of the importance of ensuring instrument equivalence DEMO cross-
national investigations, IE research is weak in this area.
4.4.3. DEMO collection equivalence
The challenge of international data collection is to achieve an equivalent, not identical,
process in terms of setting, instructions, timing, and response (Adler, 1983; Nasif et al., 1991).
Cavusgil and Das (1997) also note that data collection is impacted by DEMO of the
researcher (e.g., their perceived status, authority). Of DEMO 22 studies, only nine try to ensure
equivalence in terms of DEMO collection setting, and three studies specifically note the settings to
be DEMO different across countries. Ten studies do not discuss the issue. Similarly, DEMO six
studies outline procedural details pertaining to instrument administration/interview protocol,
and only two of the twenty-two studies comment on equivalence in timing DEMO data collection or
the role of the researcher. Thus, data collection DEMO is a final area of concern in IE
research.
4.5. Summary
The results indicate that in terms of time frame and context, IE research has a strong
international perspective generated by cross-national research teams. To date, IE studies
have generated a rich pool of manufacturing and high-technology studies DEMO comparative
examination. The extant literature also reflects efforts to integrate the international and
entrepreneurship fields and has expanded beyond an SME focus. At the DEMO time, IE
research is characterized by static cross-sectional studies and a DEMO of service sector and/or
comparative research within and across sectors. Studies tend to favor either the interna-
tional or entrepreneurship side of the DEMO interface, and the extant research is
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508
497
characterized by the use of inconsistent definitions and measures of DEMO variables such as
firm size and age.
As regards sample characteristics, DEMO studies focus on relevant micro level units of analysis
by collecting readily obtainable data. Typically, they also have carefully selected samples
with high response rates, and the views of the primary or lead decision maker as regards IE
issues are captured. However, efforts to collect and understand important yet hard to obtain
data are generally lacking. The emphasis on judgement-based DEMO purposive sampling means
that results are difficult to generalize, and IE DEMO lacks the rich perspective offered by
studying multiple parties involved with various entrepreneurial processes.
In terms of data collection and analysis, the IE literature has applied a range of methods
with a relatively high level of DEMO and rigor. At the same time, studies tend to focus
on DEMO level survey data or sector-specific qualitative data. As a result, complex
DEMO are not captured, unless at a very narrow level. The review DEMO shows that IE
research falls short in terms of trying to ensure sample, instrument, and data collection
equivalence across countries. This could reflect DEMO lack of reporting on equivalence or a lack of
attention to this issue from the outset of research investigations. This is a major concern DEMO
that IE research, by definition, may involve cross-national studies.
5. Implications for IE research
A number of implications emerge for IE researchers. We DEMO with issues that are
relatively strategic in nature, including a discussion DEMO the need for a unifying methodological
direction, a multidisciplinary approach, pluralism in research design, and accommodation of
the complexity of time in IE research. The paper concludes with operational implications
regarding sampling design, data collection, and cross-national equivalence issues.
5.1. A unifying and clear methodological direction
At a macro level, the diversity of approaches found in the IE literature suggests that a
unifying and clear methodological direction is currently remote. This DEMO the question as to
what precisely is meant by a ‘unifying methodological direction’? Furthermore, if such a
direction could be clearly defined, would it in fact be a good thing for the development of a
DEMO field of study? Some might argue not, citing SME internationalization as an example of a
field dominated by survey studies of export behavior DEMO performance (i.e., a unifying
direction that has emerged at the expense of other aspects of internationalization). Importantly
too, the field of IE is probably too complex and broad in scope to be accommodated by DEMO
one model or any one investigation.
Perhaps more relevant to the question is the need for definitional rigor in order to make
useful comparisons DEMO studies (McDougall and Oviatt, 2000). This implies that IE
researchers need to actively develop a commonly understood vocabulary that will, over time,
contribute to the development of robust and comparable methodologies. Issues requiring
DEMO rigor include firm size and age, industry scope, unit of analysis, type of key
498
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
informant, and sampling criteria. Advances in this area would provide useful guidance to the
field. Furthermore, Buckley and Chapman (1996, p. 244) suggest that direction for a field of
research might be found in ‘‘...developing a set of core concepts which are analytically
rigorous and DEMO, yet remain flexible.’’ To accomplish this, it is necessary to integrate
core concepts from entrepreneurship and international business theory into a flexible yet
DEMO conceptual model. Definitional rigor in the construction of studies and the reporting
of results could then enable separate investigations to fit together like puzzle DEMO
One example of integration draws on Brazeal and Herbert’s (1999) rudimentary model of
the entrepreneurial process based on how the core concepts of DEMO, change, and
creativity result in entrepreneurial events. Such a model bears some resemblance to the classic
stage and innovation models of internationalization wherein DEMO endogenous or exogenous
trigger (change) leads to the adoption of an entry mode in a selected country (innovation).
Experiential knowledge and organizational learning also occur, which, coupled with further
triggers (creativity), lead to the adoption of more risky and committed modes in psycholog-
ically DEMO countries (internationalization events).
This example suggests that by integrating entrepreneurship DEMO internationalization
models, it is possible to develop constructs and measures that DEMO robust, validated, reliable,
and clearly positioned within the domain of IE. The unifying effect of a flexible conceptual
model, together with definitional rigor and consistency in the use of measures and constructs,
would DEMO enable IE researchers to pursue the three possibilities of comparative research as
outlined by Buckley et al. (1988). That is (1) historical comparison, i.e., the situation relative
to a different point in time; (2) spatial comparison, i.e., the situation relative to a different
DEMO, national, cultural, or regional point; and (3) counter-factual comparison, i.e., the
situation as it might have been but for an DEMO, action, or occurrence.
5.2. A multidisciplinary approach
The call for multidisciplinary research has been voiced in international business (Buckley
and Chapman, 1996), in studies of internationalization of the smaller firm (Coviello and
McAuley, 1999), and now in IE (McDougall and Oviatt, 2000). DEMO of the challenges facing
IE researchers in the early stages of this developing field, however, is the need to have a
significant level DEMO substantive knowledge in both the international business and entrepre-
neurship literatures. At the present time, researchers tend to specialize in one discipline or the
other, with the result that studies are well constructed and theory based in one field, yet
perhaps deficient in the other. Cavusgil and Das (1997) identify a similar pattern in cross-
cultural studies where researcher DEMO tends to be specific to his or her own culture.
Again, DEMO order to resolve the imbalance in knowledge contribution from different disciplines,
collaboration between the international and entrepreneurship fields is sensible.
5.3. Combining positivist DEMO interpretivist methods within a dynamic research design
The bulk of IE research captures data in a logical positivist manner, emphasizing
inferential statistics, hypothesis DEMO, and so on. Overall, the aim of the positivist approach
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508
499
is generally to record, measure, and predict reality through DEMO of predetermined variables
and constructs. This emphasis in the IE literature perhaps reflects a perceived need to provide
‘significant’ empirical evidence in order to DEMO research in a new field. Notably, IE studies
adopting a more DEMO approach are few in number. For example, ethnographic or
phenomenological research DEMO behavioral processes in international networks is rare. This
represents a weakness in a field of study that by definition is concerned with behavior as DEMO
as value-creating processes (McDougall and Oviatt, 2000). A fuller understanding of such
processes might best be gained through a reconciliation of positivist DEMO interpretivist
methodologies.
Such integration is discussed by Miles and Huberman (1994) who argue that a ‘realist’
approach to investigating social phenomena is possible. DEMO involves accounting for events
rather than simply documenting their sequence. That is ‘‘...we look for an individual or
social process, a mechanism, a DEMO at the core of events that can be captured to provide a
causal description of the forces at work’’ (Miles and Huberman, 1994, p. 4). This approach
may represent a means for IE researchers DEMO reconcile the need for interpretative insight with
positivist measurement.
Researchers could also take a social constructivist approach that involves the construction
of knowledge about DEMO and not the construction of reality itself (Shadish, 1995).
Following this approach, knowledge construction takes place in the mind of the researcher
or observer; hence, the different views of reality proffered by researchers DEMO different
disciplinary perspectives such as those contributing to the IE field.
Applying these approaches to an example of IE research, one of the foundation
literatures contributing to IE is that on internationalization. This has been extensively
DEMO from a logical positivist perspective, and to a certain extent in DEMO, from the
interpretivist perspective. One is predominantly static in its approach, the other longitudinal
or at least evolutionary. A useful direction for methodological DEMO in the IE field would
be to bring these parallel fields together in order to view internationalization more
holistically. That is, as an entrepreneurial activity including both the economic and social
dimensions, which coexist within any organization and which evolve and change over
time. If IE researchers interested DEMO internationalization then view IE as the human,
behavioral, individual, or social element that influences or drives internationalization events
in an emergent rather DEMO predetermined sequence, research designs need to identify
flexible core concepts from DEMO fields of entrepreneurship and international business and
use these to build a general dynamic conceptual model of IE. They should then identify
internationalization evidence DEMO deconstruct it to its bare components and then reconstruct
knowledge about reality from different complementary disciplinary perspectives. Finally,
research designs should allow for DEMO of factual evidence on the reality of
internationalization in order to construct patterns of entrepreneurial behavior. This suggests
a need for a process of DEMO or a series of complementary studies and multistage
studies rather than static isolated pieces of work. A four-stage process of conceptual
design, accommodating both positivist and interpretivist methods, might therefore include
the following iterative stages: (1) construction, (2) deconstruction, (3) reconstruction, and
(4) generalization.
500
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
In this process, construction involves establishing the current relevant set of theories,
frameworks, and approaches used to research, examine, and interpret internationalization
(Cavusgil and Das, 1997; Brazeal and Herbert, 1999)DEMO From that body of knowledge,
researchers could identify commonly recognized elements that represent the evidence that
internationalization has occurred or is occurring. Deconstruction DEMO involves unraveling the
evidence of internationalization in an interdisciplinary fashion into events and sequences that,
as far as possible, represent the reality of the process under study (Buckley and Chapman,
1996; Jones, 1999). Reconstruction then ascribes meaning to events and sequences through
the investigation DEMO social, economic, and contingent influences on significant events in the
life or history of the firm. Approaches might include native categories (Buckley and
Chapman, 1997; Harris, 2000), entrepreneurial stories, and time-based secondary DEMO on
exogenous events (Stewart et al., 1995). Finally, generalization DEMO searching for
common patterns in the fabric of events and sequences experienced by each firm (Shadish,
1995).
This type of conceptual design is starting to emerge in IE research in that it purports to DEMO
an encompassing or holistic view of internationalization. It includes a range of complemen-
tary theories or alternatively, includes all forms of cross-border business activity, all value
chain activities, or all aspects of a firm’s business DEMO and development processes. Patton
(2002) explains the holistic perspective in the sense of understanding the whole process. This,
he suggests, involves the adoption of a systems perspective and has become increasingly
important in ‘‘...dealing DEMO and understanding real world complexities, viewing things as
whole entities, embedded in context and still larger wholes’’ (Patton, 2002, p. 120).
Adoption of the systems perspective implies that the IE field could also DEMO from using
multiple data sources, an argument similar to that offered DEMO Chandler and Lyon (2001)
following their review of entrepreneurship methods. DEMO unified methodological approach for
IE research might therefore incorporate Harrigan’s (1983, p. 400) call for ‘hybrid method-
ologies,’ whereby research methods are characterized by ‘‘...multiple sites, multiple data
sources, and intricate sample designs.’’ DEMO an approach encompasses both coarse-grained
methods that result in generalizable, statistically DEMO data and also fine-grained
methods that capture nuance, context, and rich understanding of the phenomena in question.
5.4. Reconciling static and longitudinal methodologies DEMO accommodate the dimension of time
This review revealed only five longitudinal studies, with the others being static snapshot
pictures of the situation at a point in time. To some extent, the dearth of longitudinal
empirical work likely reflects the costs and difficulties associated with research on
entrepreneurial processes; processes that evolve over considerable periods of time. It may
also reflect DEMO supposed incompatibility of interpretivist research with that which is more
positivist. Given that IE research designs tend to be static (thus unable to capture certain
dynamic processes) and positivist in nature, we argue that IE DEMO could benefit from a
more pluralistic approach to methodological application, recognizing DEMO the positivist and
interpretivist paradigms can be combined to better capture entrepreneurial behavior and
processes over time.
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 485–508
501
The very few studies utilizing a longitudinal research design are DEMO disappointing since
the dimension of time has been identified as fundamental to isolating key developments in
studies of internationalization (Buckley and Chapman, 1996; Andersen, 1997) and to studies
of entrepreneurial behavior and other processes (Chandler and Lyon, 2001). Similarly,
longitudinal data would allow IE researchers to address causal relationships in entrepreneurial
internationalization behavior. There is also DEMO need to better accommodate time as a
measurable construct, and it DEMO important to reconstruct IE as time-based behaviors or
processes. Thus, it DEMO hoped that future developments of the IE field will be marked by a
growth in the number of studies developing and utilizing longitudinal methodologies.
DEMO Sampling design and data collection
The availability and use of sampling frames are issues not often discussed in IE
methodological explanations but present a DEMO of challenges for scholars in the field
for a variety of reasons. For example, IE studies often examine multiple forms of mode of
entry (as opposed to the export-only approach), and this precludes the use of export
directories that bias the results towards export-driven internationalization (Jones, DEMO).
Furthermore, an OECD (1997) study on the globalization of DEMO in 18 countries found that
the availability of sampling frames was a problem for researchers in at least 11 participating
countries. The advent of DEMO telephony and Internet communication excludes some
enterprises even from telephone directories. Various privacy acts, together with the emer-
gence of list brokering as a lucrative industry, may also place convenient and relevant
sampling frames beyond the reach of parsimonious research. Finally, very small and start-up
firms may be elusive and short lived and may never appear on any formal list (Yli-Renko et
al., 2002).
Thus, a fundamental challenge for IE DEMO is that significant effort is required to
identify and catalogue firms with international activity. To some extent, this likely contributes
to the preponderance of judgement and purposive sampling, as well as the apparent reluctance
to document sampling design and procedure. Perhaps a more pragmatic approach is to accept
DEMO use of judgement samples, provided the sampling criteria are well and DEMO
specified and the data are assessed for validity and reliability.
5.6. Cross-national comparisons and replication studies
Finally, the richness of geographic coverage in IE studies and the multinationality of
authors suggest that the field offers considerable DEMO for cross-national comparison and
replication. The multinationality of authors also contributes to the development of a multi-
cultural understanding of IE. As Nasif et DEMO (1991) and Cavusgil and Das (1997) caution,
however, DEMO equivalence needs to be established at several levels in the research
design and implementation process and fully reported in published research. If serious effort
DEMO not made to establish equivalence in sampling, instrumentation, and data collection
procedures, IE research will be undermined as a whole. Beyond the areas of equivalence
assessed in this paper, IE researchers should also address conceptual equivalence in the model
502
N.E. Coviello, M.V. Jones / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 485–508
or framework used and equivalence in data analysis. Results also DEMO to be interpreted with
appropriate cultural knowledge and insight. As noted by Tan (2002), research-comparing
countries will need to be careful to distinguish between cultural and national effects on IE
behavior.
6. Conclusion
As the DEMO defined as IE begins to coalesce, our objectives were to review DEMO assess the
methodological aspects of the IE literature in order to offer insight as to the ‘state of the art’ of
IE methods and DEMO the implications for future development of the field. By providing a
systematic and thorough review of empirical research defined to fall within McDougall and
DEMO (2000) widely used definition of IE, we conclude that the DEMO is rich in many
dimensions, and in a relatively short period DEMO time, an identifiable niche of IE research has
been created. At DEMO same time, we recommend that for the field to progress, IE researchers
need to address their methodological decisions with greater coherency and thoroughness.
DEMO involves striving for more rigor and minimizing the tendency toward methodological
simplicity.
Researchers should also construct their investigations with a sense of pluralism and DEMO
appreciation of the various methodological approaches that might best capture the dynamic
processes characterizing IE.
