A St. Thomas coffee roaster has taken home top honours for their espresso.

Las Chicas del Café, based in the CASO Station, tied for first place in the Coffee Review’s November publication. Their Nicaraguan espresso del Patron received a 93 percent score in the New-World Espressos: Single-Origin Espresso from the Americas category.

Maria Fiallos and Valeria Fiallos-Soliman, sisters who co-own Las Chicas Del Café, entered their espresso in August and couldn’t wait to hear the November results. “We knew the coffee was good, but we never thought we would come out tied for number one,” Fiallos said. “It’s a huge honour.”

Fiallos-Soliman likened their win to the battle between David and Goliath.

“Other roasters have more resources, more staff behind them,” she said. “Here we are, a really small micro-roaster. It’s great for us and shows us we’re on the right path.”

The two sisters are happy their espresso has been recognized.

“You know you have a good product because we make sure the coffee we source is the absolute best,” Fiallos said. “We take a lot of care in roasting it and doing good by the grower, but then to have a third party, someone who doesn’t know you, taste your coffee against hundreds of other coffees and decide yours is the best is really cool.”

The win came just in time to celebrate the company’s first St. Thomas anniversary. Though they’ve been in business 11 years, the sisters started locally in July 2015, officially opening in November after months of construction.

“The space had such potential,” Fiallos said. “We love roasting here. It was the building that very much won us over.”

Coffee beans used are brought in from small Nicaraguan growers where the farmers are paid based on the grower’s production cost through a direct-trade transaction. It’s a fair sum according to Fiallos, considering people there still live on one to two dollars a day.

“We bring in what we grow at our small coffee farm and we buy from other small growers in the same mountain area,” Fiallos-Soliman said. “We’re fourth generation coffee farmers. Our great-grandfather started our coffee farm in the late 1800s, the same time this building was built so it’s a unique tie-in.”

The beans are roasted on site and sold through both the location at 105-750 Talbot St. and through various retailers such as Briwood Farm Market.
