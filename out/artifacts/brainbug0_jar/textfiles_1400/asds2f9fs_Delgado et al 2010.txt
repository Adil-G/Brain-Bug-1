1. Introduction
In this article, we examine the impact of agglomeration on entrepreneurship at the
regional industry level. In particular, we focus on the role of clusters, or agglomerations
of closely related industries, in new business formation. Large variations in regional
employment growth and in the rate of new firm creation are a striking feature of the US
economy (Armington and Acs, 2002; Porter, 2003). While a significant body of work
explores why some regions experience more rapid growth than others (Porter, 1990,
1998a, 1998b; Glaeser et al., 1992; Saxenian, 1994; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1995;
Fujita et al., 1999), there is increasing academic and policy interest in the particular role
in growth played by entrepreneurship (Davis et al., 1996; Haltiwanger et al., 2009). A
significant debate is underway regarding the role of the regional economic environment
in shaping differences in the rate of regional entrepreneurship and overall economic
performance (Porter, 1990, 1998a, 1998b; Saxenian, 1994; Feldman, 2001; Glaeser and
Kerr, 2009).

This article examines the role of regional clusters in regional entrepreneurship. We focus
on the distinct influences of convergence and agglomeration on growth in the number of
start-up firms as well as in employment in these new firms in a given region-industry. While
reversion to the mean and diminishing returns to entrepreneurship at the region-industry
level can result in a convergence effect, the presence of complementary economic activity
creates externalities that enhance incentives and reduce barriers for new business
creation. Clusters are a particularly important way through which location-based
complementarities are realized. The empirical analysis uses a novel panel dataset from
the Longitudinal Business Database of the Census Bureau and the US Cluster Mapping
Project. Using this dataset, there is significant evidence of the positive impact of clusters
on entrepreneurship. After controlling for convergence in start-up activity at the regionindustry level, industries located in regions with strong clusters (i.e. a large presence of
other related industries) experience higher growth in new business formation and start-up
employment. Strong clusters are also associated with the formation of new establishments of existing firms, thus influencing the location decision of multi-establishment
firms. Finally, strong clusters contribute to start-up firm survival.

Any effort to explain region-industry performance growth must account for two
countervailing economic forces: convergence and agglomeration (Delgado et al., 2007).
Convergence arises when, due to diminishing returns, the potential for growth is
‘declining’ in the level of economic activity (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991).
Agglomeration exerts an opposite force on regional performance. In the presence of
agglomeration economies, the potential for growth is ‘increasing’ in the level of
economic activity (Glaeser et al., 1992). From an empirical perspective, distinguishing
the differential impact of convergence and agglomeration has been problematic. For
example, if both convergence and agglomeration effects are present, the impact of the
initial level of economic activity on growth will reflect a balancing of the two effects.
We move beyond this traditional impasse by identifying the impact of agglomeration
while simultaneously accounting for the impact of convergence. Our key insight is that
while forces that give rise to both convergence and agglomeration operate ‘within’
narrow economic units, agglomeration across complementary economic units can have
a separate and distinctive impact. Building on cluster theory, we focus specifically on
economies of agglomeration that arise within clusters of complementary industries
related by technology, skills, shared infrastructure, demand and other linkages. The
complex interactions that take place within clusters suggest a useful focus on the
presence (or absence) of supporting and related industries rather than diversity of
industries per se (Porter, 1990, 1998a, 2003; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Delgado
et al., 2007; Frenken et al., 2007).
This article examines a particularly important channel through which cluster-driven
agglomeration might operate: entrepreneurship. The presence of a cluster of related
industries in a location will foster entrepreneurship by lowering the cost of starting a
business, enhancing opportunities for innovations and enabling better access to a more
diverse range of inputs and complementary products (Saxenian, 1994; Porter, 1998a;
Feldman et al., 2005; Glaeser and Kerr, 2009). The co-location of companies,
customers, suppliers and other institutions also increases the perception of innovation
opportunities while amplifying the pressure to innovate (Porter, 2000). Since entrepreneurs are essential agents of innovation, a strong cluster environment should foster
entrepreneurial activity.
The empirical analysis exploits the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) of the
Census Bureau and the cluster definitions from the US Cluster Mapping Project
(Porter, 2003). This classification system defines clusters as collections of industries with
high levels of co-location in terms of employment. We consider several related measures
of the cluster environment surrounding a region-industry, including a measure based on
individual clusters, a more encompassing measure that incorporates linkages among
related clusters (i.e. ‘linked’ clusters), and a third measure that captures the strength of
similar clusters in neighboring regions. We measure entrepreneurship and industrial
composition utilizing a dataset that spans the years 1990–2005, includes 177 mutually
exclusive economic areas (EAs) in the contiguous US, and incorporates 588 ‘traded’
industries constituting 41 clusters for each EA.1
Our empirical work focuses on early stage entrepreneurship, which we measure using
two related indicators of start-up activity: the number of new establishments of new

2. Clusters and entrepreneurship
Numerous mechanisms are associated with the entry of new businesses in agglomerated
areas. Starting with Marshall (1920), regional studies have highlighted at least three
distinct drivers of agglomeration: knowledge spillovers, input–output linkages and
labor market pooling. Over time, an extensive literature has also incorporated
additional agglomeration drivers, including local demand characteristics, specialized

firms in a region within a given traded industry (which we refer to as the level of
‘start-up establishments’); and the employment in these new firms (which we refer to as
the level of ‘start-up employment’). We compute the growth rate in start-up
establishments and start-up employment in each regional industry, and estimate the
impact of the extent of cluster-driven agglomeration while accounting for the impact of
convergence. Our core specifications incorporate region and industry fixed effects.
We find striking evidence for the simultaneous yet distinct influences of agglomeration and convergence on the growth rate of start-up establishments and employment.
Growth in start-up employment at the region-industry level is declining in the initial
level of start-up employment at the region-industry level, consistent with the presence of
a convergence effect in start-up activity due to either mean reversion and/or to the
potential for local crowding-out of entrepreneurial opportunities within a regional
industry. At the same time, however, growth in start-up employment is increasing in
measures of the cluster environment surrounding the region-industry. We obtain similar
findings for the growth of start-up establishments. By accounting for convergence and
the potential for competition within each regional industry, we are able to isolate the
positive impact of cluster-related complementarities on entrepreneurship. The results
provide support for the hypothesis that strong clusters facilitate growth in
entrepreneurship.
While our main focus is the formation of start-up firms, we also look at new
establishments of existing firms. We find that stronger clusters are also associated with
greater formation of new establishments of existing firms. While more research is
needed on the locational decisions of multi-location (multi-establishment and multinational) firms, such firms seem to be opening establishments in locations where strong
clusters are present (Enright, 2000; Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Manning, 2008).
The contribution of established firms to regional entrepreneurship is an important
question for future work.
Finally, we examine the role of clusters in the medium-term performance of start-ups.
A strong cluster should increase the productivity of participating firms, which raises the
bar for the survival of new businesses. At the same time, a strong regional cluster can
facilitate the growth of start-up firms by providing better access to the necessary inputs
to commercialize products and services. We find that a strong cluster environment
improves the level of employment in young (up to five-years-old) start-up firms in a
region-industry, suggesting that clusters facilitate the medium-term survival of
start-ups.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. We begin by discussing the relationship
between entrepreneurship and cluster-driven agglomeration, and develop the main
hypotheses. Section 3 presents the empirical framework. Section 4 explains the data and
Section 5 discusses the main findings. A final section concludes.

institutions and the structure of regional business and social networks (Porter 1990,
1998a, 2000; Saxenian, 1994; Markusen, 1996). While most empirical studies of
agglomeration focus on variables such as the overall employment growth, an emerging
literature emphasizes the role of new businesses in regional economic growth (Feldman
et al., 2005; Acs and Armington, 2006; Haltiwanger et al., 2009; Glaeser and Kerr,
2009). Relative to incumbent firms, entrepreneurs may be more likely to identify
opportunities (both in the form of new technologies and new markets) that exploit
distinctive sources of regional comparative advantage. However, there is a high rate of
churning of young firms in most countries and sectors (Dunne et al., 1988, 2005;
Barteisman et al., 2005; Kerr and Nanda, 2009). Start-up firms have greater exit rates
than established firms since they often lack experience and resources. Importantly,
however, those start-up firms that survive tend to have greater growth potential than
established firms. The presence of a strong cluster environment, which reduces barriers
to entry and growth and enhances regional comparative advantage, should be a central
driver of entrepreneurial vitality.
The precise mechanisms by which the regional economic environment impacts
entrepreneurship are numerous and subtle. Chinitz (1961) hypothesizes that a key
requirement for entrepreneurship is the presence of a network of smaller suppliers, and
attributes differences in the rate of entrepreneurship between New York and Pittsburgh
at that time to differences in the structure of suppliers. Building on earlier studies, a rich
(though mostly qualitative) literature has emerged examining the relationship between
entrepreneurship and regional economic performance. For example, Saxenian (1994)
attributes the success of Silicon Valley to the culture of entrepreneurship and a more
decentralized organization of production (relative to Route 128). An extensive literature
also highlights the broader relationship between entrepreneurship and the regional
innovation system (e.g. Audretsch, 1995; Feldman, 2001; Acs et al., 2009). Recently,
Glaeser and Kerr (2009) test for the impact of specific Marshallian economies of
agglomeration on new firm entry; while their analysis does not specifically evaluate the
impact of clusters, they provide complementary evidence that the presence of small
suppliers and workers in relevant occupations is associated with a higher level of new
business creation.
At the same time, a small but growing literature within regional and international
business studies examines key interactions between the internal organization of the firm
(start-ups, multi-location, small or large, young or old, etc.) and the agglomeration
benefits realized within a geographical location. One dimension that has received special
attention is the role of small (and younger) firms in extracting and generating economies
of agglomeration, and spurring additional new business creation (Henderson, 2003;
Rosenthal and Strange, 2003; Glaeser et al., 2010). In contrast, other regional and
cluster studies highlight the importance of so-called ‘anchor’ firms (including
multi-establishment and multinationals) that induce spin-offs and attract firms from
related industries (Enright, 2000; Agrawal and Cockburn, 2002; Klepper, 2007;
Greenstone et al., 2008). Further research is needed to understand the locational
strategy of multi-location firms and their contribution to entrepreneurship in a
particular region.
The main goal of this article is to test whether the presence of related economic
activity in a region facilitates the growth of start-up establishments and start-up
employment in regional industries. There are numerous channels that may facilitate
economies of agglomeration (see the review by Rosenthal and Strange, 2004). Here we

We draw on the convergence concept used by the cross-sectional growth literature to study economic
activity across countries, regions and regional industries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Bostic et al.,
1997; Henderson et al., 1995). However, the analysis of convergence is broader, and has historically
explored firm growth based on Gibrat’s Law (Geroski and Gugler, 2004; Sutton, 1997). It is useful to note
that the presence of a negative relationship between the start-up activity growth rate and its level is
consistent with convergence to a limiting distribution of start-up activity growth rates.
While we test for convergence at the region-industry level, convergence may also operate at the industry
and region levels. In this article, we use region and industry fixed effects to control for these issues.

suggest that important agglomeration forces are due to the presence of clusters—
supporting and related industries—instead of industry diversity per se (Porter, 1990,
1998a; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Delgado et al., 2007). Thus, we use Porter’s
(2003) empirical cluster framework to explore agglomeration across sets of industries
related by the full array of technology, skills, demand or other linkages.
Our first hypothesis focuses on the relationship between the growth of start-up
activity and the initial level of start-up activity within a region-industry. We expect a
convergence effect (i.e. the coefficient on the initial level of start-up activity will be
negative). This convergence in start-up activity can be interpreted in terms of
mean-reversion (arising even from measurement error) and diminishing marginal
returns to entrepreneurial opportunities arising from crowding-out effects.2 Mean
reversion implies that a region-industry that has a relatively high level of start-up
activity at t0 (compared to the average start-up activity in the industry in other regions
with similar size and economic composition) is more likely to experience a lower
(stochastically determined) growth rate of start-up activity between t0 and t1 (Barro and
Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Quah, 1996). At the same time, it is possible that the returns to
entrepreneurial activity can be diminishing in the level of entrepreneurial activity as the
result of input scarcity. For example, if the price of specialized (labor or capital) inputs
is increasing in the intensity of competition among start-up firms, there will be
diminishing returns to entrepreneurship as a result of congestion costs (Sorenson and
Audia, 2000). As a result, a high level of entrepreneurship in a region-industry at a point
in time may result in diminished near-term opportunities for entrepreneurship in that
region-industry. Thus, our first hypothesis is that there will be convergence in
entrepreneurship at the narrowest unit of analysis: the region-industry growth rate of
start-up activity will be declining in the initial level of region-industry start-up activity.3
Our remaining hypotheses focus on the impact of related economic activity on the
growth rate of start-up activity. Conditional on the convergence effect, the relationship
between related economic activity and entrepreneurship will depend on how the
presence of particular types of economic activity impacts on entrepreneurial incentives.
The incentives for start-up entry in a particular location will reflect the nature of
competition (Porter, 1980; Bresnahan and Reiss, 1991). While the returns to
entrepreneurship are lower in the presence of intense price-based competition, rivalry
may also lead to higher pressure to innovate and greater entrepreneurial incentives. At
the same time, the presence of complementary economic activity—specialized suppliers,
a local customer base, producers of complementary products and services—increases
the pool of inputs available and enhances the range of profitable entry opportunities
and so improves entrepreneurial incentives. The empirical relationship between
entrepreneurship and particular types of pre-existing economic activity will therefore
depend on whether these activities are substitutes or complements (Bulow et al., 1985).

In the article, we do not test how the nature of competition affects start-up activity. Instead, we test
whether complementarities with established firms (which would yield a positive relationship between
industry specialization and start-up activity) outweigh the potential for (priced-based) competition
between start-ups and established firms (yielding a negative effect).

It is useful to distinguish, then, between the level of specialization of a region in a
particular industry and the strength of the cluster environment around that industry.
On the one hand, the relationship between industry specialization and entrepreneurship
growth is ambiguous. While industry specialization in a location may enhance
opportunities for learning, innovation, and entrepreneurial spawning (Audretsch, 1995;
Gompers et al., 2005; Glaeser and Kerr, 2009), a large presence of established firms
(relative to the size of the national industry) intensifies local competition, dampening
incentives for entrepreneurial entry. Our second hypothesis is, then, that the empirical
relationship between industry specialization and the growth rate of entrepreneurship in
that industry is ambiguous, and will depend on the precise nature of competition (cost- or
innovation-based) and the pattern of strategic interaction between entrant and established
firms.4
In contrast, a strong cluster environment surrounding a particular region-industry
enhances the incentives and potential for entrepreneurship. The firms within a
geographically concentrated cluster share common technologies, skills, knowledge,
inputs, consumers and institutions, facilitating agglomeration across complementary and
related industries. A strong cluster environment enhances growth at the region-industry
level by facilitating operational efficiency and raising the returns to business expansion,
capital investment and innovation, thereby increasing job creation and productivity
(see e.g. Porter, 1990, 1998a, 1998b; Saxenian, 1994; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999;
Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Delgado et al., 2005, 2007; Cortright, 2006).
More specifically, clusters facilitate new business formation and the growth of
successful start-ups by lowering the costs of entry (e.g. by providing ready access to
suppliers or low-cost access to specialized inputs, offering an environment in which the
costs of failure may be lower), enhancing opportunities for innovation-based entry (as a
stronger cluster environment will allow local entrepreneurs to develop and commercialize new technologies more rapidly) and allowing start-up firms to leverage local
resources to expand new businesses more rapidly. Finally, strong clusters are often
associated with the presence of innovation-oriented local consumers, thus providing
increased opportunities for entry into differentiated market segments. As a result,
entrepreneurship is a particularly important channel for cluster-driven agglomeration,
and may therefore be crucial for the role of clusters in enhancing regional performance
(Saxenian, 1994; Porter, 1998a; Swann et al., 1998; Feldman, 2001; Feldman et al.,
2005; Feser et al., 2008; Wennberg and Lindqvist, 2008). Thus, our third hypothesis is
that, after controlling for the convergence effect, the growth rate of entrepreneurship will
be increasing in the strength of the cluster environment in the region.
It is useful to also consider the impact on entrepreneurship of similar clusters in
neighboring regions. On the one hand, strong clusters in neighboring regions enhance
the opportunities and lower the costs of entrepreneurship (e.g. by providing access to
suppliers and customers, by allowing firms to leverage local technology and institutions,
etc.). Indeed, Delgado et al. (2007) find that clusters that are co-located in nearby
regions benefit from inter-regional spillovers. At the same time, the presence of a strong
cluster in a neighboring region is a source of locational competition, particularly for

3. Econometric model
To test our hypotheses, we need to evaluate the distinct impacts of agglomeration and
convergence forces on start-up activity. We measure start-up activity in two related
ways: the number of establishments by new firms in a region within a given traded
industry (i.e. ‘start-up establishments’) and the employment in these new firms (i.e.
‘start-up employment’). We are interested in separating out the role played by industrial
clusters in start-up activity, while controlling for the economic activity within a
region-industry, as well as broader factors such as the overall growth of a region or
industry. To do so, we evaluate how the growth in start-up activity at the
region-industry level is impacted by the initial level of start-up activity, industry
specialization, the strength of the cluster environment surrounding the region-industry
and region and industry fixed effects. Our core econometric specification is therefore:

The dependent variable is the growth rate in start-up activity of industry i in cluster c at
region (EA) r, where the base period is the mean level of start-up activity during 1991–
1994, and the end period is the mean level of start-up activity during 2002–2005 (the
Data section includes a detailed explanation of the variables). The explanatory variables
include the level of start-up activity in the EA industry, industry specialization and
measures of the strength of related economic activity: cluster specialization, the strength
of linked clusters and the strength of similar clusters in neighboring regions. Our
hypotheses are that the growth rate in start-up activity is subject to a convergence effect
(50), is increasing in the strength of clusters and linked clusters (b240, b340), and

capital investment and demand. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the impact of the
strength of the cluster environment in neighboring regions on the growth rate of
entrepreneurship is ambiguous, and will depend on the relative salience of inter-regional
spillovers versus locational competition.
While we focus on the formation of start-up firms to measure entrepreneurship, for
robustness we also examine all ‘new’ establishments (including new establishments of
existing firms). The opening of new establishments is an important channel by which
entrepreneurial firms grow and contribute to regional performance. The location
decisions of multi-establishment (and multinational) firms will depend on their
portfolio of industries and locations (see e.g. Dunne et al., 2005; McCann and
Mudambi, 2005), and so the location decisions of these firms may differ from those of
start-ups. Overall, we expect a strong cluster environment will also attract new
establishments of incumbent firms since such firms benefit from the specialized
resources of particular locations (Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Manning, 2008).

4. Data
To estimate Equation (1), we combine data from the Longitudinal Business Database
(LBD) of the Census Bureau with cluster definitions drawn from the US Cluster
Mapping Project (Porter, 2001, 2003). Before turning to the variable definitions, it is
useful to provide an overview of these two data sources.
The LBD provides annual observations of the universe of US establishments with
payroll from 1976 onward (see Jarmin and Miranda, 2002).6 Importantly, the LBD
distinguishes between entrepreneurship—the initial entry of a new firm in its first
establishment—and business expansions by existing firms through the opening of new
establishments. We aggregate this establishment-level data to the region-industry level
and the region-cluster level, using four-digit SIC codes as the primary industry unit and
EAs as the geographic unit.7
The cluster definitions are drawn from the US Cluster Mapping Project (USCMP).
While the measurement of complementary economic activity in a consistent and
unbiased manner is a considerable challenge,8 the USCMP develops a methodology for
grouping four-digit (and some three-digit) SIC codes into cluster and linked cluster

Based on LeSage (1999, p.171), we test for spatial autocorrelation by running a first-order spatial
autoregressive (FAR) model on the residuals of our core OLS specifications. The estimated coefficients
are highly insignificant (coefficients of 0.001 with p-values above 0.98), suggesting non relevant spatial
correlation.
We drop establishments with very noisy average wages (below half of the minimum wage or above $2
million USD). Our findings are robust to including these observations.
There are 179 EAs covering the US, and they reflect meaningful economic regions (see Johnson and Kort,
2004). To minimize concerns about differences in the definition of neighbors, we exclude the Alaska and
Hawaii EAs.
A small literature considers alternative classification schemes. Ellison and Glaeser (1997) study the
coagglomeration of industries, creating an index reflecting ‘excess’ concentration. Feldman and Audretsch
(1999) group those industries that have a common science and technological base, using the Yale Survey
of R&D Managers. Other studies define linkages between industry activities in terms of their
technological proximity (Jaffe et al., 1993). Finally, Ellison et al. (2007) find that input–output linkages
and labor pooling are key drivers of the co-agglomeration of industries. This reasoning is consistent with
the methodology developed in Porter (2001, 2003). See also Feser and Bergman (2000).

has an ambiguous relationship with industry specialization (b1) and the strength of
clusters in neighboring regions (b4).
Our main econometric specification also accounts for other differences across regions
and industries that affect start-up growth through the inclusion of industry (i) and
region fixed effects (r). Our analysis thus controls for unobserved factors (such as
idiosyncratic demand shocks, regional policies, etc.) that might be correlated both with
our explanatory variables and the start-up growth rate.
To account for correlation across industries within a regional cluster, the standard
errors are clustered by region-cluster. Finally, since nearby regions tend to specialize in
like clusters, there might be spatial autocorrelation of the performance and/or
unobserved attributes of a region and its neighbors. We account for this by including
in our main specifications the strength of similar clusters in neighboring regions (and
region fixed effects). Additionally, we test for spatial correlation and find that this is not
an issue.5

4.1. Variable definitions and sample description
4.1.1. Entrepreneurship.
Our two main measures of entrepreneurial activity are start-up employment and
start-up establishments by new firms within a given EA industry. Specifically, ‘start-up
employment’ is defined as the level of employment in new firms during their first year of
operation (with payroll); and ‘start-up establishments’ is the count of these new firms.
Consistent with prior work (e.g. Glaeser and Kerr, 2009), we computer 4-year averages
for these annual start-up activities. Using a multi-year span (and including a
census-year in the base and terminal periods) allows for a better signal of the true
level of entrepreneurial activity and also reduces the number of EA industries in which
we observe zero entrants during a given period.12
One main goal of this article is to evaluate how the cluster environment impacts the
growth rate of entrepreneurship. While this focus allows us to evaluate the role of the
cluster environment on regional dynamics, the most straightforward approach to
evaluating growth—taking ln(Start-up activityi,r,2002–2005/Start-up activityi,r,1991–1994)—
must account for the fact that there are many EA industries in which there is a zero level
of employment or, relatedly, a zero level of start-up activity in the study period. In

To use industry data back to 1990, the analysis employs SIC system. By construction, recent NAICSbased data can be translated (with some noise) into the older SIC system.
In contrast, local industries do not agglomerate and focus on local demand.
It is possible that industries with high co-location may have little economic relationship. Thus, in the
USCMP two adjustments are made to the cluster definitions to eliminate spurious correlations. First,
the SIC industry definitions and list of products and services are used to reveal logical links. Second, the
national input–output accounts are used to look for meaningful cross-industry flows (see Porter, 2003).
While industries that have meaningful interactions tend to co-agglomerate in space, there are nongeographical dimensions of proximity (e.g. institutional and organizational factors) that could also
facilitate the interactions among industries and their firms (Boschma 2005; Torre, 2008). Our cluster
definitions cannot directly capture these non-geographical dimensions.
In the LBD data the inflow of new establishments may be recorded with some delay, with Census-years
being most accurate in recording new establishments.

groupings.9 The methodology first distinguishes between three ‘types’ of industries with
different patterns of spatial competition and locational drivers: traded, local and
natural resource-dependent. To focus our analysis on those industries most closely
linked to our hypotheses, we focus exclusively on the traded industries. These industries
consist of 588 (mostly) four-digit SIC codes that are associated with service and
manufacturing industries that sell products and services across regional and national
boundaries.10
Porter (2003) assigns each traded industry into one of 41 mutually exclusive traded
clusters (referred to as ‘narrow clusters’), where the set of industries within each cluster
primarily reflects pairwise correlations of industry employment across locations. This
approach to define cluster boundaries captures multiple types of agglomeration
economies (technology, skills, shared infrastructure, demand and other linkages).11 For
example, in the information technology cluster, nine individual industries are
incorporated, including electronic computers (SIC 3571) and software (SIC 7372).
These cluster definitions form our measures of complementary economic activity (see
Appendix A for a list of the 41 clusters and their rate of entrepreneurship, and Porter
(2003) for additional details).

4.1.2. Industry and cluster specialization.
Our main empirical task is to examine the impact of the industry and different aspects
of the cluster environment on the growth rate in start-up activity. As such, we require
measures of industry and cluster specialization, as well as the strength of related and
neighboring clusters. We draw on prior work which uses location quotients (LQ) as a
measure of regional specialization (e.g. Glaeser et al., 1992; Porter, 2003). Specifically,
the employment-based industry specialization in the base year (1990) is measured by the
share of regional employment in the industry as compared to the share of US total
employment in the national industry:

employi,r employr

,
INDUSTRY SPECEmploy,i,r,90 ¼
employi,US employUS
where r and i indicate the region (EA) and the industry, respectively. This indicator
captures to what extent the industry is ‘over-represented’ in the EA. In the data, the
employment-based industry specialization of EAs has a mean of 2.01 (Table 1).15

We scale the start-up activity indicators by adding the minimum annual start-up employment (1) and
start-up establishments (0.01) in the sample, which is a standard procedure to scale variables.
This high skewness of start-up activity is documented in other studies (e.g. Glaeser and Kerr, 2009).
The specialization indicators are based on employment (count of establishments) in the start-up
employment (establishment) models.

either of these cases, we are required to either exclude those observations or impose a
positive lower bound on the level of start-up activity.
We focus our analysis on a sample of EA industries that have a non-zero level of
employment during 1990 (53,213 observations). Then, to include in the analysis EA
industries where we observe zero start-up activity, we set a minimum level of start-up
activity.13 Alternatively, we show that our results are robust to the subsample of EA
industries with a positive level of start-up activity in both the baseline and terminal
period (11,981 observations).14
Finally, we further account for the large number of zeros by examining the impact of
the cluster environment on the level of start-up activity (versus growth), using all EA
industry pairs. These analyses include probit specifications that evaluate the probability
of any start-up activity, and count models that account for the skewed distribution of
start-up activity.
While we primarily focus on start-up establishments, we also examine total new
establishments (including new establishments of existing firms). To do so, we compute
two entry indicators: ‘entry employment’ is defined as the level of employment in all
new establishments within a given EA industry; and ‘entry establishments’ is the count
of these new establishments. We then compute the growth rate in entry employment and
establishments (see Table 1).
Finally, to test for the role of clusters in the medium-term performance of start-ups,
we examine the level of employment in young (up to 5–year-old) start-ups in regional
industries. The dependent variable is the (log of) average employment in 2004–2005 of
start-up firms borne during 2001–2003 in the EA industry (ln employment in start-up
survivorsi,r).

We utilize an analogous procedure to define cluster specialization. For a particular
EA industry, the specialization of the EA in cluster c is measured by the share of
regional employment within the cluster (outside the industry) as compared to the share
of US total employment in the national cluster (outside the industry):

i
employr
employoutside
c,r
CLUSTER SPECEmploy,icr,90 ¼
:

outside i
employUS
employc,US
It is useful to note that, with the inclusion of EA and industry fixed effects, the
independent variation in industry specialization is driven by variation in employment in
the EA industry, and the variation in cluster specialization comes from the employment
within a given EA cluster (outside the industry).
Table 2 illustrates key attributes of the top regional clusters based on cluster
specialization in 1990.16 Top clusters tend to have a higher level of start-up activity,
larger establishments and a higher presence of older firms than other clusters.
Interestingly, on average over 30% of all the establishments in a top cluster belong to
firms that have establishments in more than one geographical market (EA). This
suggests that a cluster may establish linkages with other locations through the presence
of these regionally diversified firms.17

16
17

The top EA-clusters are the top-10 EAs by cluster specialization for each cluster. This criterion is
complemented with a minimum share of the US cluster employment (above the 20th percentile value).
We do not distinguish between employment in primary and headquarters activities and employment to
serve local markets (e.g. sales offices). Hence we may overstate ‘‘true’’ cluster employment (Porter, 2003).

Downloaded from joeg.oxfordjournals.org at Temple University on August 13, 2010

Note: The top regional clusters are the top-10 EAs by cluster specialization for every cluster (e.g. for
automotive the top-one regional cluster would be in Detroit-Warren-Flint, MI). Multi-EA establishments
measures the presence in a local cluster of firms that are active in more than one geographical market (EA)
for a given cluster (e.g. Microsoft has establishments in the IT cluster in many EAs). Specifically, this
variable is the rate of establishments of multi-EA firms in a given EA cluster. Avg. size establishment is the
average employment size of the establishments in a given EA cluster. Young (old) establishments is the rate
of establishments with age 55 years (age 410 years) in a given EA cluster.

The presence in a region of clusters linked to cluster c is then defined by a weighted sum
of the LQs associated with each linked cluster:

For instance, based on this weighting which emphasizes the degree of overlap between
clusters, our measure of the strength of linked clusters for industries within the
automotive cluster will weigh the presence of the metal manufacturing cluster more
heavily than the presence of the furniture cluster (see Delgado et al. 2007).
Finally, we develop a measure of the presence of like clusters in neighboring regions
(cluster specialization in neighbors). In part, we include this measure based on the
empirical observation that specialization in a particular cluster tends to be spatially
correlated across neighboring regions. To explore the role of neighboring clusters in
start-up growth in a region-industry, we compute the (average) specialization of
adjacent EAs in the cluster (including the focal industry).

5. Results
Our analysis begins in Table 3 which shows the average start-up growth rates for EA
industries, based on their initial levels of start-up activity and cluster specialization. We
divide all EA industries into four categories based on whether they have low or high
(below or above the median) level of start-up employment and cluster specialization (for
their industry). We find that there is a significant decrease in the average start-up
employment growth rate [between the baseline (1991–1994) and the terminal period
(2002–2005)] when moving from low to high initial level of start-up employment,
consistent with convergence in start-up activity (e.g. the growth rate decreases from 25
to 33% for the EA industries with low cluster specialization). Importantly, regardless
of the initial level of start-up employment, there is a significant increase in the growth of

4.1.3. Strength of linked and neighboring clusters.
We additionally develop measures of the strength of ‘linked’ clusters and the presence of
clusters in neighboring regions. The measure of linked clusters is developed using the set
of ‘broad’ cluster definitions in Porter (2003). Specifically, while the narrow cluster
definition (used for the earlier measures) classifies each industry into a unique cluster, in
the broad cluster definition each industry may be associated with multiple clusters
(based on locational correlation of employment). To develop a measure based on
linkages to cluster c, we identify those broad clusters that have at least one of cluster c’s
narrow industries in common. For example, in the case of automotive, the linked
clusters include production technology, metal manufacturing and heavy machinery;
among others. Having identified the set of clusters linked to a cluster (C*), we then
measure the degree of overlap between each pair of clusters (c, j) using the average
proportion of (narrow) industries that are shared in each direction:

start-up activity when one moves from an EA industry with a low level of cluster
specialization to one with high level of cluster specialization (e.g. the growth rate
increases from 25 to 36% or from 33 to 9%). In other words, those regional
industries that are located in a relatively strong cluster experience much higher growth
rates in entrepreneurship.
While the sharp contrasts in Table 3 are intriguing, it is possible that alternative
factors are driving these results. We therefore turn in Table 4 to a more systematic
regression analysis. The dependent variable is the start-up employment growth rate. In
Table 4 (Model 1), we include only the initial levels of start-up employment, industry
specialization and cluster specialization. The results provide evidence for the two main
findings of this article. First, there is a large convergence effect—the initial level of
start-up employment is associated with a decline in the expected growth rate of start-up
activity. At the same time, the presence of complementary economic activity in the form
of clusters also has an important positive influence on the growth rate of entrepreneurship. Both industry and cluster specialization (outside the industry) are associated
with higher growth in start-up activity.
These results are reinforced in Table 4 (Model 2), where we incorporate the strength
of linked clusters and the strength of the cluster in neighboring regions, and control for
the total employment in the region. Both cluster specialization and the presence of
linked clusters have a positive influence on the start-up growth rate, while strength of
clusters in neighboring regions is actually associated with a lower growth of start-up
activity. This latter finding is consistent with the hypothesis that neighboring clusters
may also attract entrepreneurs and so provide a substitute for growth within a
particular EA. Interestingly, the employment size of the region contributes to the
growth of start-up activity of its regional industries, countervailing the convergence
forces that take place at the region-industry level.
In Table 4 (Models 3 and 4), we implement the core specifications, in which we
include region and industry fixed effects. The main results concerning convergence and
the impact of cluster specialization are robust. The only meaningful change in the
estimates concerns the impact of neighboring clusters. The estimated coefficient

depends on whether we control for industry and region heterogeneity; not surprisingly,
given that the expected effect is ambiguous.
Finally, in Table 4 (Model 5), we use the subsample of EA industries with positive
start-up activity during both the base and terminal periods (this allows us to avoid the
scaling adjustments to the dependent variable and the convergence effect measure that
we discussed in the Data section). The main results are robust. To illustrate the size of
the effects, an increase in the industry specialization variable (cluster and linked clusters
specialization variables) from the first to the third quartile value is associated with a
3.4% (1.5%) increase in the annual start-up employment growth rate.
The core findings concerning the convergence effect and the impact of clusters persist
when we examine growth in start-up establishments. In Table 5, the dependent and
independent variables are now based on counts of establishments, and the structure of
the specifications mirrors the logic of Table 4. Interestingly, the only significant
difference in the results concerns the effect of industry specialization on entrepreneurial
growth. Whereas the coefficient on industry specialization was positive in the start-up
employment models, the coefficient is negative in models (5-1) and (5-2). The coefficient
becomes positive when we include region and/or industry fixed effects. The heterogeneity of this parameter across specifications is consistent with the fact that the expected
effect is ambiguous. In contrast, the coefficient on the impact of clusters is positive
across all specifications.18

It is useful to emphasize that our core findings on start-up activity growth (Tables 4 and 5) are robust
to a variety of sensitivity checks. We have included in the model a dummy indicator equal to one for

In Table 6, we consider an alternative measure of ‘new’ economic activity by
examining the growth in employment in all ‘new’ establishments (including new
establishments by existing firms) and counts of all new establishments. Each of the
specifications in Table 6 includes EA and industry fixed effects, and only vary in the
measures of related economic activity that are included and whether the dependent and
explanatory variables are measured based on employment (Table 6, Models 1 and 2) or
based on counts of new establishments (Table 6, Models 3 and 4). The results are robust
across all the specifications—the growth rate of entry declines with the initial level of
entry activity (convergence), and increases with the presence of related industries within
the cluster and linked clusters. Importantly, these findings hold when we focus only on
new establishments of existing firms. In the data, these new establishments often belong
to firms that operate in like clusters in other locations (EAs). While more research is
needed, the findings suggest that multi-location firms seem to be opening establishments in strong clusters.
Moving beyond our growth framework, in Table 7 we examine the probability of any
start-up activity and the level of start-up activity using all EA industry pairs. In Table 7
(Model 1), we study the probability of any start-up activity during 2002–2005 using a
probit model that includes a dummy equal to one if the EA industry experienced any
EA-industries with any start-up activity in the base period to further capture unobserved factors that
influence entrepreneurship. We have varied the length and precise dates of the base and terminal periods.
Specifically, we consider start-up activity during the base period (1991–1995) and the terminal period
(1997–2001). Finally, we use a larger (noisier) sample that includes establishments with wage outliers
(average wage below half of the minimum wage or above $2 million USD), which are dropped from our
initial sample. In each of these cases the main results are robust.

industry and the overall cluster environment, and EA and industry fixed effects. We
find that the probability of any start-up activity is increasing in the strength of the

In Table 7 (Model 2) we examine the count of start-up establishments during 2002–
2005 using a fixed effects negative binomial model, and the same independent variables
than in the probit model (Table 7, Model 1). The estimated incidence-rate ratios suggest
that an increase in the initial strength of the cluster (industry) has a 33% (29%) boost
on the subsequent count of start-up establishments. Finally, these findings are
confirmed when we study the annual count of start-up establishments in 1997 and
2002 (census years) using a negative binomial model with year, EA and industry fixed
effects (Table 7, Model 3).20 The findings in Table 7 reinforce the estimates from the
growth models: the probability of any start-up activity and the level of start-up
establishments are increasing in the strength of the cluster environment.
Finally, while the focus of this article is the formation of new businesses, we also
examine the role of clusters in the medium-term performance of start-ups. In particular,
in Table 8, we study the level of employment in young (up to 5 years old) start-ups in an
EA industry using our core econometric specifications (and samples). We find that a
strong cluster positively affects the level of employment in young start-ups, suggesting

For EA-industries with zero employment, we replace (log) industry specialization with the minimum
value of this variable.
Drawing on Blundell et al. (1995), we include an indicator of pre-existing start-up activity to control for
unobservable attributes of EA-industries that influence entrepreneurship.

Note: Bold numbers refer to coefficients significant at 1% level. In model 7-1, the dependent variable is a
dummy equal to one for EA industries with any start-up activity during 2002–2005; the coefficients are
marginal effects from the probit model. In model 7-2, we examine the count of start-up establishments
during 2002–2005 using a negative binomial (NB) model, and the coefficients are the incidence-rate ratios.
In model 7-3, we examine the annual count of start-up establishments in 1997 and 2002 using a NB model.
To avoid convergence problems, in the NB models we combine the 10% smallest EAs and national
industries by employment size in a single EA and a single industry dummy, including in the models a total
of 160 EA dummies and 529 industry dummies. Alternatively, we drop the 10% smallest EAs and
industries and the same findings hold.

that clusters facilitate survival and growth. In a related paper we explore more carefully
the role of clusters in new business growth and the attributes of successful start-ups.

6. Conclusion and extensions
This article finds striking evidence for the simultaneous yet distinct influences of
agglomeration and convergence on the growth in the number of new firms and
employment by new firms in regional (traded) industries. The growth in start-up
activities at the region-industry level is declining in the initial level of start-up activity at
the region-industry level due to convergence forces. After controlling for convergence,
however, there is strong evidence that the presence of a strong cluster surrounding a
region-industry accelerates the growth in start-up activities. We find that industries

located within a strong cluster or that can access strong related clusters are associated
with higher growth rates in the formation of new firms and in start-up employment.
These findings offer an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the
impact of related economic activity on entrepreneurship and economic performance.
Most notably, building on the cluster framework developed by Porter (1990, 1998a,
1998b), this article moves beyond the traditional debate in which the presence of related
economic activity simultaneously gives rise to complementarities as well as competition
for inputs and customers, clouding the interpretation of any particular empirical
finding. By first accounting for convergence and the potential for competition within
each industry in a region, we are able to isolate the important impact of cluster-related
complementarities on entrepreneurship. In other words, while at a (narrow) industry
level firms may compete for a given pool of resources, the cluster environment that
surrounds an industry will increase the pool of competitive resources and reduce the
barriers of entry for new firms. Strong regional clusters enhance the range and diversity
of entrepreneurial start-up opportunities while also reducing the costs of starting a new
business.
While our analysis has focused on new business formation, we also examine the
medium-term performance of start-ups. We find that clusters contribute to the level of
employment in young start-ups in regional industries, suggesting that a strong cluster
environment in a region enhances the performance of start-ups. The role of clusters in the
dynamics of new businesses is an open research question that we are further investigating.
Our findings support the idea that clusters of related and complementary industries
facilitate the growth in the formation of new businesses and the medium-term

performance of start-ups in regional industries, even after controlling for the strength of
the region-industry as well as region and industry heterogeneity. There is large
heterogeneity in the types of entrepreneurship that we could further explore. Start-ups
will differ in size, innovative-orientation and their growth potential. Similarly, we could
also examine the role of the attributes of the firms that participate in clusters (e.g. size,
age, and region and product diversification). Further understanding the role of clusters
in the demography of entrepreneurship will help design more effective entrepreneurship
policies.
Finally, we find that clusters also matter for the formation of not just new firms, but
of new establishments of existing firms. These new establishments often belong to firms
that participate in like clusters in other locations, suggesting that firms may seek
complementary regional clusters, benefiting from the comparative advantages of each
location. While more research is needed, regional clusters may integrate into national
and global value chains often through complex networks of subsidiaries of
multi-location firms (Dunning, 1998; Porter, 1998b; Enright, 2000; Alcacer, 2006).
Drawing on international business studies, future work should further study the
attributes of clusters that are more attractive for multi-location firms, and how their
participation in multiple clusters affect the organization and performance of these
firms, and how they contribute to entrepreneurship in a particular regional cluster.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on LBD data and Porter’s (2003) cluster definitions. Service clusters
are those with more than 35% of employment in service industries. High-tech clusters are manufacturing
clusters with high R&D and patenting. ‘Entry’ measures refer to all new establishments (start-up firms and
new establishments of existing firms). The last two columns report the rate of startup employment/
establishments (as percentage of employment/establishments in the cluster).
