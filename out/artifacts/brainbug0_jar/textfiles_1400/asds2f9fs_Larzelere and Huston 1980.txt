Toward Understanding Interpersonal Trust
in Close Relationships*

Interpersonal trust is an aspect of close relationships which has been virtually
ignored in social scientific research despite its importance as perceived by intimate
partners and several family theorists. This article describes the development, validation, and correlates of the Dyadic Trust Scale, a tool designed for such research. It is
unidimensional, reliable, relatively free from response biases, and purposely
designed to be consistent with conceptualizations of trust from various perspectives.
Dyadic trust proved to be associated with love and with intimacy of self-disclosure,
especially fbr longer marriedpartners. It varied by level of commitment, being lowest
for ex-partners and highest for those engaged and living together, for newlyweds,
and for those married over 20 years. Partners reciprocated trust more than either
love or depth of self-disclosure. Future research could fruitfully relate dyadic trust to
such issues as personal growth in relationships, resolving interpersonal conflict, and
developing close relationships subsequent to separation or divorce.

Analyses of human relations suggest that
"trust" is an integral feature of such relationships. Trust is most generally defined as a
belief by a person in the integrity of another
individual. Stinnett and Walters (1977) suggest that trust increases security in a relationship, reduces inhibitions and defensiveness,
and frees people to share feelings and
dreams. Trust is seen by O'Neill and O'Neill
(1972) as a prerequisite for marital partners

to open their marriage to their full potential
for personal and interpersonal growth. These
and related postulates (Dion and Dion, 1976;
Driscoll et al., 1972; Lederer and Jackson,
1968; Olthuis, 1975) which use the concept of
trust as an interpretive concept fail adequately to establish what they mean by trust
and to provide satisfactory measures of the
phenomenon. The present paper seeks to
remedy these deficiencies by operationalizing
the concept of trust, demonstrating its measurement, and reporting on the relationship
between our construct and related aspects of
close human relationships. Thereafter, we
suggest a number of research questions and
approaches which might employ our method
of measuring trust to gain deeper insight into
relationships.
Two attributions seem particularly pertinent aspects of interpersonal trust as conceptualized in the literature. The first is an

JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY

595

<-----Page 2----->attribution concerning the partner's benevolence (Altman and Taylor, 1973; Deutsch,
1962; Ellison and Firestone, 1974; Giffin,
1967; Lorr and Youniss, 1973; Pearce, 1974;
Phillips and Metzger, 1976; Wrightsman,
1964). Is a partner genuinely interested in the
other's welfare or only in his/her own welfare? In other words, is the partner motivated
individualistically (i.e., to seek his/her own
gain) or is he/she motivated cooperatively
(I.e., to seek joint maximum gain)? These
motivations may often lead to the same interpersonal behavior, but an attribution of a
partner's major motivation would influence a
prediction about some future time when the
two motivations might lead to different interpersonal behaviors. The second form of attribution concerns honesty (Altman and Taylor,
1973; Giffin, 1967; Lederer and Jackson,
1968; Lorr, 1975; Pearce, 1974; Rotter, 1971;
Schlenker et al., 1973; and Wrightsman,
1964). To what extent can I believe my partner when he tells me about his future intentions? If a graduate student husband, for
example, promises to pay for his wife's education after he graduates, how much does his
wife believe him?
The attributions that one's partner is both
benevolent and honest or sincere are important for assessing the future potential of a
relationship. The more that the target person
is seen as benevolent and honest toward the
perceiver, the more likely the perceiver will be
to predict a favorable future for the relationship. Attributed benevolence allows a person
to feel comfortable despite becoming more
intimate and therefore potentially more
vulnerable in the relationship. Attributed
honesty appears to be a prerequisite for taking the partner's word at face value as indicative of genuine future intentions. While
benevolence and honesty are conceptually
distinct, they may turn out to be so intertwined in interpersonal relationships, especially intimate ones, that they are operationally inseparable. If a partner's honesty is
questioned this may lead to doubting his
benevolence, and vice versa.
Thus, the conceptualization of trust in the
literature leads to the following definition:
trust exists to the extent that a person believes
another person (or persons) to be benevolent
and honest. Dyadic tyrust can be distinguished from generalized trust in that the
former refers specifically to the benevolence
596

and honesty of a significant other toward the
individual making the judgment. Generalized
trust, in contrast, refers to a person's belief
about the character of people in the aggregate
(Rotter, 1967, 1971; Wrightsman, 1964).
Dyadic trust was expected to be associated
with characteristics of relationship intimacy
such as love, self-disclosure, and commitment. Since trust is, in part, an attribution of
benevolence directed toward the attributor,
the partner's benevolence should influence
the first person's trust. Benevolence seems
also to be an important component of love.
Four of 12 items on Rubin's (1970) Love Scale
apparently tap this component of love (e.g.,
"I would do almost anything for [my
partner]"). Therefore, it was predicted that
trust in one's partner would be correlated
with that partner's love.
As intimate partners get to know one
another better, their attributions should become more accurate with time. Dion and
Dion (1976) found that couple love and trust
scores were more highly correlated for marital
than for premarital partners, but individual
love and trust scores (i. e., one's own love and
trust) did not become more correlated with
time. One possible explanation for this is that
it is the partner's love rather than one's own
love that becomes more highly related to
one's own trust for that partner over time.
Such an association between one's own trust
and the partner's love would influence the
relationship between the couple love and trust
scores but not the relationship between the
individual love and trust scores. Thus, it was
predicted that one's own trust and the partner's love would be more highly correlated for
married couples than for dating couples.
Altman and Taylor (1973) have stated that
trust is necessary for self-disclosure in ongoing relationships. They suggest that the
reciprocity of disclosure may be based on
reciprocity of trust in such relationships.
While this makes sense intuitively, it remains
unsupported by empirical data. Several
studies have found no correlation between
trust and self-disclosure (MacDonald et al.,
1972; McAllister and Kiesler, 1975; Vondracek and Marshall, 1971), but none of these
studies used measures of both trust and disclosure with respect to a particular other person. In this study, it was predicted that selfdisclosure to an intimate partner would correlate positively with dyadic trust.

<-----Page 3----->Finally, dyadic trust would seem to be a
prerequisite for commitment, with higher
levels of trust necessary for higher levels of
commitment. Thus, newlyweds, on the
average, should have higher trust than engaged or cohabiting partners, who, in turn,
should have higher trust than exclusively dating partners. The latter, then, should have
more trust than casually dating partners.
Trust in ex-partners (whether ex-dating or exmarried) should tend to be less than trust
levels in currently close relationships. Longer
married couples should have average trust
levels below the newlywed ceiling level and
above the divorced floor level. Since dyadic
trust has little room to increase above the expected high level for newlyweds, those who do
decrease in trust during marriage, even
though they are a minority, should bring the
average level of trust below the newlywed
level.
Associations among self-report scales are
often inflated by a common component of a
social desirability response bias (Edwards,
1957). To check whether this was a confounding factor, the discriminant validity of the
Dyadic Trust Scale was ascertained by examining whether dyadic trust was more closely
associated with the indicators of interpersonal intimacy than was social desirability.
A similar issue involves whether dyadic
trust improves on available measures of
generalized trust (e.g., Rotter, 1967; Wrightsman, 1964). If generalized trust is also
associated with love, self-disclosure, and relationship status, then the predicted relationships for construct validity might be found
simply because of the overlap between dyadic
trust and generalized trust. Therefore, associations of trust with intimacy were also examined after substituting each generalized trust
measure for the dyadic trust score. As before,
discriminant validity was demonstrated to the
extent that dyadic trust was more strongly
related to the variables of interest than was
generalized trust.
METHOD
Subjects
People in both dating and marriage relationships were included as research participants in this investigation. The dating sample
included 195 persons: 16 who were casually
dating, 90 who were exclusively dating, 54
August 1980

who were engaged and/or living together,
and 35 who responded concerning a previous
dating relationship. Eighty of these participated with their partners (i.e., 40 dating
couples). There were 120 females and 75
males. Ages ranged from 18 to 30 years, with
a mean of 20.8 years.
There were 127 research participants in the
married sample, including 20 newlywed couples, 20 longer married couples, 45 divorced
(or separated) partners, and two longer married partners who were from different marriages. The ages of the newlyweds averaged
23.5 years, ranging from 19 to 35 years. They
had all been married less than two months.
The ages of the longer married participants
ranged from 19 to 67 years with a mean of
35.8. The average time married was 13.2
years. Divorced partners, 29 women and 16
men, ranged in age from 22 to 77 years with a
mean of 33.0. They had been separated from
their spouses from 3 to 60 months with a
mean of 19.8 months. The average length of
their marriage from wedding date to separation was 8.6 years.
Almost all of the dating sample were recruited through one of three classes in Courtship and Marriage at the Pennsylvania State
University. (Two other couples were obtained
from poster advertisements.) The dyadic trust
item pool and the Marlowe-Crowne Social
Desirability Scale (Crowne and Marlowe,
1964) were administered to all class members. Those who said they were exclusively
dating, engaged, living together, or married
were contacted about participating with their
partners in a subsequent part of the study.
Couples were then given the additional questionnaires as well as the dyadic trust and
social desirability items.
Eighteen longer married couples were recruited using a sample from the local telephone directory. (Two other couples were
contacted through the classroom procedure.)
Letters were sent to 74 randomly selected
names. Forty-eight couples were contacted by
telephone to answer any questions and to attempt to gain their cooperation.
Twenty newlywed couples who had been
married less than three months were
recruited with a similar procedure. Letters
were sent to 69 couples with recent marriage
licenses who had local telephone numbers.
About 100 divorced (or separated) partners
were asked to participate in this study after

by another investigator. Forty-five usable
questionnaires were returned by mail.
Development of the Dvadic Trust Scale
Rather than constructing items from
scratch, the dyadic trust item pool was comprised of 57 items borrowed or adapted from
previous scales which have measured some
type of trust (Barak and LaCrosse, 1975;
Dion and Dion, 1975; Driscoll et al., 1972;
Jansen, 1952; Lewis and Larzelere, in press;
Rotter, 1967; Wrightsman, 1964). The items
were selected and modified if necessary to fit
the conceptual definition of dyadic trust and
to be applicable for both dating and marriage
relationships.
To reduce order effects, the dyadic trust
items were arranged in two different sequences. Different pronouns were used for
male and female forms. Finally, the past
tense was used on many of the items in the
versions given to divorced partners.
Since unidimensionality is necessary for
most test theory and for construct validation
(Lumsden, 1976), factor analyses were used
to determine the dimensionality of the item
pool. Four criteria were used to select items
for the final form of the Dyadic Trust Scale:
(1) Jackson's (1971) Differential Reliability
Index (which used both item-total correlations and the correlations between the items
and social desirability); (2) the distribution of
responses to each of the items; (3) the repetitiveness of items' contents; and (4) the direction of wording. These criteria maximized reliability, and minimized social desirability,
skewness, and repetitiveness in the final
scale, which had about half of the items
worded in each direction. Item analyses were
based on two-thirds of the sample so that an
unbiased reliability estimate could be derived
from the other third of the data.
Additional Questionnaires
All participants completed the dyadic trust
item pool and the social desirability scale.
The 40 dating couples, the 20 newlywed
couples, and the 20 longer married couples
were also administered the Rubin (1970) Love
Scale, a self-disclosure measure using 60 of
Taylor and Altman's (1966a, 1966b) items,
the Trustworthiness subscale of Wrightsman's (1964) Philosophies of Human Nature
598

Scale, and Rotter's (1967) Interpersonal
Trust Scale.
The self-disclosure instrument included 10
items in each of six categories selected from a
larger pool of items and categories used by
Taylor and Altman (1966a, 1966b) in their
research. The average of the two intimacy
values calculated in Taylor and Altman's
study (from their two samples) was used as
that item's intimacy value for this study. The
six selected topical areas included religion,
family background, emotions and feelings,
relationships with other people, school and
work, and own marriage and family. Items
were selected from the Taylor and Altman
item pool to represent a range of intimacy in
each topical area, but with more emphasis on
items with high intimacy.
For each item, participants indicated their
level of disclosure to their partner as "fully"
or "partly" disclosed, "none," "misrepresented," or "doesn't apply at all." For each
of the six categories, depth of disclosure was
scored by dividing the mean of the intimacy
values for the three most intimate items fully
disclosed in that category by the mean of the
three most intimate items within the category
considered applicable (i.e., in which the
subject did not answer "doesn't apply at all").
This ratio (alwaysbetween 0.1 and 1.0) constituted that category's depth of disclosure score.
The calculations were intended to tap depth of
self-disclosure independently from breadth of
disclosure. The ratio was used instead of a
simpler average because the response "doesn't
apply at all" would otherwise have been scored
as a "none" response. The overall depth of disclosure score was determined by taking the
mean of the depth of disclosure scores across
the topical areas.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of the Dyadic Trust Scale
The criteria for multiple factors of dyadic
trust were not met in the factor analyses of
the item pool data. The first factor in a principal components factor analysis solution accounted for almost half (48.2 percent) of the
variance. In the two-factor solution, items
which loaded on the second factor dealt with
trust in nonrelationship situations (e.g.,
cheating on exams, taxes, and movie admittance). One additional factor did seem rele-

<-----Page 5----->vant to trust in relationships in the four-factor
solution, but it had only two factor loadings
above .40 and both of those items had higher
factor loadings on the major trust factor. Consequently, it was concluded that dyadic trust
was a unidimensional construct.
Table 1 lists the eight items which were
chosen for the final scale together with their
Differential Reliability Index scores (the
major criterion), their average item scores,
and whether or not they require reverse scoring. The item-total correlations are high,
ranging from .72 to .89. The mean item
scores indicate moderate or strong agreement
with high trust statements, ranging from 4.8
to 5.9 on a 7-point scale. Five of the selected
items are reverse-scored to reduce acquiescence response bias.
Using data from the third of the sample
that was not used for item selection, the
Dyadic Trust Scale had a reliability of .93
(coefficient alpha) and had low correlations
with social desirability (r = .00, n.s.) and
with both generalized trust scales (Wrightsman: r = .17, p < .05; Rotter: r = .02, n.s.).
Thus, the scale is highly reliable, unaffected
by social desirability, and operationally distinct from generalized trust.
Self-Report Correlates
Dyadic trust and love. Dyadic trust and
love were strongly associated with each other
regardless of whether individual scores or
couple scores (sum of two partners' scores)
were used. The correlations between individuals' trust and love scores were high for dating partners (r = .45, p < .001), for married
partners (r = .48, p < .001), and for the total
.47, p < .001). Using couple
sample (r
scores, the correlations between dyadic trust
and love were also substantial (r's were .51,

dating; .58, married; .55, total sample; all p's
<.001).
Based on our interpretation of the previous
literature, we expected that Partner A's
dyadic trust for Partner B would be correlated with Partner B's love for Partner A (and
vice versa). This was only partially supported.
Females' trust was correlated .23 (p< .05)
with their partners' love. In contrast, males'
trust was not correlated significantly with
their partners' love (r = .06, n.s.). It may be
that dyadic trust is more crucial for the partner with fewer resources (usually the woman),
who is more dependent on her partner's
benevolent use of his greater resources. Trust
is more relevant to interpersonal decisionmaking when an individual must make a
choice between vulnerable and safe options
rather than when options differ little in vulnerability (Ellison and Firestone, 1974; Kee
and Knox, 1970; Pearce, 1974; Schlenker et
al., 1973). The range of vulnerability of options would usually be greater for women
since they generally face greater potential
exploitation, both economic and physical.
This idea that feelings of trust and the partner's love are apt to be more closely connected when dependency is high needs to be
empirically tested.
However, the fact remains that Partner A's
trust in Partner B is more associated with A's
own love for B than with B's love for A.
Males' trust was correlated .41 (p < .001) with
their own love for their partner; females' trust
was correlated .52 (p < .001) with their own
love for their partner. Perhaps this indicates
that when one doubts a partner's trustworthiness, one's love for that partner erodes also.
This is consistent with Berscheid and Fei's
(1977) finding that insecurity was higher for
those who were not sure whether they were in
love than for those who felt certain they were

<-----Page 6----->in love. Or, to look at it another way, the data
suggest that, when one grows to trust one's
partner, one's love grows too. This effect, or
something like it, apparently outweighs the
influence of one partner's benevolence on the
other partner's trust.
It was further thought that the degree of
association between dyadic trust and love
would increase with the depth of the relationship. However, the correlations for couple
scores or for individual scores (between the
same partner's love and trust) both followed
an unexpected curvilinear pattern (see Table
2). In both cases, the correlations were
highest for longer married couples (r = .83,
p < .001, couple; r = .67, p < .001, same
partner), but the second highest correlations
were for exclusively dating couples (r = .59,
p<.01, and r = .53, p<.001, respectively).
The correlations for engaged or cohabiting
partners and for newlyweds were all smaller
and not significantly different from zero (r's
from .22 to .37). It was specifically predicted
that the correlation for married partners
would be significantly larger than the one for
unmarrieds, but this was not found regardless of whether one examined couple scores
(r = .58 and .51, respectively) or individual
scores (r = .48 and .45).
Previous comparisons of correlations between love and trust for married versus unmarried couples (Dion and Dion, 1976; Driscoll et al., 1972) have probably included far
fewer newlyweds in their married sample than
the 50 percent in this present investigation.
Therefore, additional comparisons were made
between the correlations for unmarrieds and
the correlations for the longer marrieds only.
For couple scores, the correlation of .51 for
unmarried couples was significantly less than
the .83 for longer married couples (z =
2.112, p < .05). Using individual-score correlations, the correlation for unmarried partners (.45) was very near to being significantly

less than the .67 for longer married partners
(z = 1.619, p = .053). Thus, the comparisons of correlations that are most similar to
analyses made by Dion and Dion (1976) and
Driscoll et al. (1972) show the expected increase in the association of love and trust with
increased commitment to the relationship.
These results raise questions about the importance of Dion and Dion's (1976) distinction between couple scores and individual
scores for understanding associations between trust and love. Their finding of a difference in the correlational trends for couple
scores versus individual scores was not replicated in this study.
More importantly, the entire pattern of
correlations raises questions about the original rationale of Driscoll et al. (1972) that the
increase in correlations indicates a shift from
romantic love to conjugal love. The dip in the
correlations of love and trust for engaged,
cohabiting and newlywed couples does not
support such an explanation. A similar dip in
love-trust correlations at the engaged stage
was also noted by Dion and Dion (1976) for
couple scores.
An attributional interpretation of the pattern of correlations between dyadic trust and
love seems to make sense. Attributions are
future-oriented and the relevant future period
dramatically lengthens around the time of
marriage. Major changes in relevant situational factors would also make attributions
less certain near such an important transition
point in the relationship. Consistent with this
is the finding that engaged persons experience a wide range of feelings, with many
indicating much turbulence and trauma in
this period of their relationship (Braiker and
Kelley, 1979). One example would be the
common concern of engaged or newlywed
persons about how marriage may change
their partners. Thus, an attributional explanation would be consistent with the pattern of

elsewhere.
Dyadic trust and self-disclosure. Depth of
self-disclosure was also associated with
dyadic trust (r = .25, p < .01). This was the
case for dating (r = .19, p < .05) and married
(r = .40, p < .01) participants considered
separately. These findings support Altman
and Taylor's (1973) notion that trust is a prerequisite for intimate self-disclosure in ongoing relationships.
As for the trend in correlations between
dyadic trust and self-disclosure intimacy,
there seems to be a general tendency for the
strength of associations to increase as relationship commitment increases. The correlations between dyadic trust and self-disclosure
increase from .12 for exclusively dating partners to .34 for partners engaged or living
together, .27 for newlyweds, and .40 for
longer married partners. However, the correlation for exclusively dating partners is not
significantly lower than the correlation for
more committed relationships combined
(z = 1.18).
Discriminant validity of data regarding
dyadic trust, love, and self-disclosure. Dyadic
trust has excellent discriminant validity for
correlations with love and for correlations
with depth of self-disclosure. Not one of the
69 correlations used for discriminant validity
was significantly greater than zero (p<.05).
This includes correlations between love or
self-disclosure on one hand, and generalized
trust or social desirability on the other. In all
69 comparisons, dyadic trust always correlated more with love or depth of self-disclosure than did generalized trust or social desirability.
Finally, discriminant validity was investigated relative to the increase in correlations
between love and dyadic trust from the dating

period to the longer married period. There
was no evidence that either social desirability
or generalized trust became more associated
with love or self-disclosure as commitment increased. Together, these results indicate that
dyadic trust is much more clearly related to
relationship qualities such as love and
self-disclosure than is either generalized trust
or social desirability.
Dyadic Trust and Relationship Status
Dyadic trust generally varied by relationship status as hypothesized. Table 3 reveals
how average dyadic trust scores for seven different relationship statuses differed significantly from each other (F = 41.30, p < .01).
As predicted, divorced partners tended to
have less dyadic trust for their ex-partners
than married persons had for their partners.
In fact, the separated or divorced were clearly
lower than any other group in dyadic trust
(p < .001). Even so, 36 percent of the divorced
partners trusted their partners more than they
distrusted them, although only 2 percent had
trust scores above the mean for married partners. Ex-dating partners had significantly less
dyadic trust than any other group except for
the casual daters (p <.05). Those who were
currently involved in relationships had fairly
close dyadic trust averages, with dyadic trust
increasing very slightly from casual daters
through newlyweds and then decreasing
slightly in longer married couples. The only
predicted differences between current relationship statuses that were statistically significant (p <.05) were between casual daters
and newlyweds, between casual daters and
those engaged and/or cohabiting, and between exclusive daters and newlyweds.
Two subgroups of interest because of their
high average trust were those who were both
engaged and living together (average dyadic

connected by one underline. Casual daters also are not significantly different from exclusive daters since these
two groups are connected by a second underline. Casual daters are significantly different from all of the remaining groups in the table since they are not connected by an underline with any of them (Miller, 1966:83-84).

<-----Page 8----->trust = 52.0, n = 6) and those married
more than 20 years (average trust = 51.8,
/i = 14). The trend in dyadic trust among
married partners is especially interesting.
Average dyadic trust drops from 49.4 for
newlyweds and 49.7 for those married between three months and six years to 44.3 for
those married from 6 to 20 years. Then there
is the jump to 51.8 for those married over 20
years. The group married from 6 to 20 years
has significantly lower trust than any one of
the other three groups (p<.05). Consequently, the original prediction that dyadic
trust would be less for longer marrieds than
for newlyweds was supported, but only for
one subgroup. The overall trend is consistent
with Nowak's (1977) impressions from her
dissertation interviews that middle-aged
wives were least trusting and that elderly
partners were most trusting. She suggests
that the drop in trust during middle age may
occur as a result of the lessening of perceived
youthfulness and physical attractiveness. The
results here, however, indicate that it is
middle-aged husbands rather than wives who
are significantly lower than that of husbands
in any of the other three groups (p < .05).
All intimate relationships which involve an
exclusive commitment to one person have a
fairly high level of trust. Several possible
longitudinal inferences can be suggested from
these cross-sectional data. First, it takes
awhile to develop high trust prior to an initial
commitment, as evidenced by the lower trust
found in casually dating partners. Second,
the breaking-up process involves a deterioration of dyadic trust. It is not clear from these
data whether a decrease in trust leads to the
breakup of the relationship or whether the
breakup process itself diminishes trust. Finally, there is some evidence for a drop in
marital trust during the middle years followed by a later increase to new heights. As
with marital adjustment, this curvilinear
trend needs to be investigated by longitudinal
research designs before making definite conclusions about a marital trend in dyadic trust.
It could be that the apparent trend is merely a
selective effect due to a greater likelihood of
divorce for low trusting partners.
Whereas the different types of relationships often differed in average dyadic trust,
they differed in neither generalized trust
(Rotter: F = .47, n.s.; Wrightsman: F =
.39, n.s.), nor social desirability (F = .75,
602

n.s.). Consequently, the discriminant validity
of dyadic trust was again strongly supported.
Reciprocity of trust, selfldisclosure, and
love. An additional set of findings from this
study indicate that dyadic trust was the only
relationship characteristic that was significantly reciprocated between partners (r =
.21, p < .05). Neither love (r = .05) nor
depth of self-disclosure (r = .13) was significantly reciprocated. This does not replicate
the results obtained by Dion and Dion (1976),
who reported that love was significantly reciprocated (r = .41, p < .001), but not trust
(r = .17, n.s.).
The reciprocity of dyadic trust was especially noticeable for longer married partners
(r = .54, p < .01), while disclosure intimacy
showed a strong trend toward reciprocity for
this group of respondents (r = .37, p =
.06). Curiously, love correlated negatively,
though not significantly, between longer married partners (r = -.21, n.s.). The low association of love between partners might possibly be explained in terms of the principle of
least interest (Waller, 1938). A substantial
portion of couples may be asymmetrical in
their power and love due to the discrepancy of
their levels of interest in the relationship (Safilios-Rothschild, 1976). Since Rubin (1970)
found dating partners' love to be reciprocated, and the Dions did not examine dating
and married pairs separately, it may be that
asymmetry of love and power is more common in marital than in premarital relationships, whereas dyadic trust and intimate disclosure become more reciprocal with increasing commitment. Further research is necessary to evaluate such a speculation.
CONCLUSION
The eight-item Dyadic Trust Scale has
demonstrated good face validity, high
reliability, and excellent construct validity
with regard to its associations with love, selfdisclosure, and relationship status. Strong
evidence of discriminant validity relative to
generalized trust and social desirability was
also found.
Several findings indicate that dyadic trust
is an important aspect of intimacy, worth
further investigation in research studies.
Such trust is strongly related to love and selfdisclosure, especially for couples beyond the
newlywed stage. Our cross-sectional data
suggest that trust increases with commitment

drop in trust precedes the termination of the
relationship or whether persons redefine their
former partners as untrustworthy after the
relationship has been broken, or both. There
is some indication (longitudinal research is
needed for stronger evidence) that trust has a
curvilinear relationship over the family life
cycle. Finally, reciprocity of dyadic trust in
intimate relationships is at least as strong as
the reciprocity of self-disclosure, and apparently stronger than reciprocity of love.
Three topics for future work seem to have
great potential to us. The first issue concerns
how the contemporary emphasis on individual
personal growth affects trust in close relationships. Both sides could be argued. Personal
growth adherents would emphasize that
individual growth is foundational to relationship growth. But the viewpoint that the relationship is desirable only as long as it contributes to personal growth may substantially
undermine long-term trust.
A second issue involves patterns of dealing
with unmet expectations and how coping patterns influence changes in dyadic trust. On
the one hand, unmet expectations could diminish trust if a partner used that for justification for questioning trustworthiness in
other areas. On the other hand, understanding why expectations were unfulfilled could
lead to more realistic expectations which, in
turn, would provide a better foundation for
dyadic trust.
Finally, it would be interesting to investigate whether divorce hinders a person's
ability to trust a new intimate partner, and, if
so, what factors influence the development of
dyadic trust in such situations.
Thus, dyadic trust appears relevant to a
rather diverse set of interesting issues. If trust
is of fundamental importance for society, as
Rotter (1971) suggests, how much more is it
basic to relationship intimacy? The Dyadic
Trust Scale allows researchers to begin to
move beyond speculation concerning the
importance of trust to investigate its correlates and consequences in premarital, marital, and other types of close relationships.
