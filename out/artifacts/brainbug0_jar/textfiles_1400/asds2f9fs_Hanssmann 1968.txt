Suppose that an investing firm is primarily interested in achieving a specified minimum return, critical to its economic survival. Then it seems appropriate to maximize the probability of exceeding the aspiration level. This decision criterion will be applied in the context of several stochastic static
investment models with budget constraint. As long as the aspiration level
does not exceed the maximum expected return achievable with the given
budget, the desired investment strategy must be sought among the efficient
solutions in the Markowitz sense. For higher aspiration levels this is no longer
true. For the special ca,se of the Markowitz model we show that all investment projects with expected yield not exceeding the aspiration level (of yield)
should be rejected. This is a surprising confirmation of a well-known deterministic rule of investment theory and practice in a rather different context.

Introduction

This paper is concernedwith a probability-orientedinvestment criterionfor
stochastic investment models. Models treated in the literatureusually assume
that each investment alternativerequiresa deterministicinvestment and yields
a stochastic return. We shall make the same assumption.
The followingcriteriahave been proposedfor the analysisof investmentalternatives:
1. Maximizationof expectedreturn;
2. Maximizationof expectedreturnsubject to a constrainton the varianceof
return;
3. Maximizationof expectedutility.
Only the first and second possibilities can be consideredas operational.As
Weingartnerhas observed,the first criterionadds little beyond the deterministic case (Weingartner,1966). Deterministicreturnsare simply replacedby expected returns.The second approachwas introducedin a classical treatise by
Markowitz (1959). His work was subsequently extended by Sharpe (1963),
Baumol (1963), and Cord (1964). An investment alternativethat satisfiesCondition 2 above is referredto by Markowitzas "efficient".There is an efficient
alternativefor each specifiedvalue of the variance (providedthat this value is
achievableat all). As long as the decisionproblemis viewed as one of choosinga
trade-offbetween (expected) return and variance, it is clear that the decision
makermay confinehis attention to the set of efficientalternatives.Given these,
he may select an alternative that accordswith his subjective attitude toward
risk.
In the present article we shall view the decisionproblemin a differentway.
We assumethat the investingfirmis primarilyconcernedwith achievinga specified minimum return that is critical to its economic survival. Therefore, we shall
endeavor to maximize the probabilityof exceedinga specifiedreturn. This decision

criterionwill be appliedin the context of severalstatic investmentmodels similar to the Markowitzmodel.

The present study was done independently from Roy's work (Roy, 1952).
It turns out that Roy postulates the identical decision criterion by the "safety
first" principle but uses a different model structure. He admits of negative investments which he interprets as contracting for liabilities. We require investment variables to be nonnegative. As will be shown below, this restriction substantially changes the character of the computational problem. In addition,
we give solutions for more general models with non-linear return functions.
Statement

of the General Problem

We consider the following static investment model. A list of investment
"projects" i = 1, * , n is given. We may invest a continuous amount,
(la)

x>i O,

in project i. In addition to the Markowitz model, certain competitive bidding
models also exhibit this structure (Hanssmann and Rivett, 1959; Friedman,
1956). We further suppose that the firm has already decided on the total amount
B it wiUlinvest:
Xi = B.

(lb)

The individual investment xi is deterministic. It will be supposed that it yields a
stochastic return yi. Total return from the investment program is given by the
random variable
Y =

(2)

i=1 yi.

The probability distribution of the random variable yi is assumed to depend on
xi alone. (Tliis assumption does not imply statistical independence of returns).
In particular, the expected value of yi is given by a "return function"
(3)

1ls=~~~~~~~fi(xi),

(i-

.. , n).

The return functions are assumed to be non-decreasing. Similarly, the standard
deviation of yi is given by a "dispersion function"
a-i = gi(xi),

(4)

(in1,

,).

Return functions and dispersion functions are supposed to be available. From
Equation 3 it is clear that the expected value of the total return Y may be
written as
E

Likewise, the standard deviation of total return is of the form

relationship,

since individual variances are additive.
Finally, let C be the critical value of total return that we wish to exceed. Since
it is our intention to maximize the probability Pi Y _ C}, it is clear that we
must know something about the nature of the probability distribution of total

return.It is not sufficientto merely know mean and standard deviation from
Equations5 and 6. Hence it appearsthat the problemis not generallysoluble.
We shall, therefore,restrict ourselvesto those cases where the distributionof
totalreturn can be approximatedby a normaldistribution.If N(u) designates
the standardizedcumulativenormaldistribution,then it is clearthat the probability of exceedingthe critical return C is given by
([C-E]/S).
(8)
PiY? C=l1-N
Furthermore,becauseof the monotonicityof a cumulativedistributionfunction,
the criticalprobabilityP will be maximizedby minimizingthe argumentof the
cumulativenormaldistribution.In other words, it is sufficientto minimizethe

.

subject to the budget constraintof Eq. lb and the nonnegativityconstraintsof
Eq. la. We shall distinguishthe case of linear return functions and dispersion
functions (Markowitzmodel) fromthe generalnonlinearcase. In the linearcase
statistical interdependenceof returnsis admitted. In the general case we shall
have to assumestatistical independenceof returnsin orderto take advantageof
Equation7. A computationalprocedurefor solutionwill be presentedthat relies,
in part, on dynamic programming.
It is worth mentioningthat our decision criterion leads to the holding of a
single asset any time the returnon a risklessasset exceedsC. Underthese conditions, the formal proceduresto be presented break down, and the solution is
obvious. We may thereforeexclude this case from the followingdevelopments.
Model I: Independent

Linear Returns

In accordancewith the Markowitzmodel, we now assume the followinglinear form of the return and dispersionfunctions:
(10)

f(xi)

=exex

oi = g(xi)

= sixi

Ai =

(i
(i

n),
where ei and si are constants. These are easily interpreted.If we invest an
1 in project i, then the returnwill be a randomvariable qi with
amount xi
mean ei and standarddeviation si. Let us also introducethe covariances,j between the random variables 7, and qj. From the linearity of the model it is
clear that total return may be written as
(11)

(12)

Y

=

*

,

i1 xi7, .

From the standpoint of stochastic variation, the decision variablesxi are constant coefficients.We are, therefore,dealing with a linear combinationof random variables. It follows from well-knownstatistical theorems that the variance of total returnmay be written as
S = Z=1
i six; + 2E1 EX_t SZjxixj
(13)
This quadraticfunction was used by Markowitz.In the presentsection we shall
assume statistical independenceof returns. Therefore,the covariancessij vanish. We may then change the scale of each variable xi by the positive factor
l/si. This linear transformationreduces Equation 13 to a sum of squares.If,

<-----Page 4----->36

for simplicity's sake, we designate the transformed variables by the original
symbols x,, we have
S2

(14)

=

2

The change of scale does not affect the linearity of the return functions. If, for
simplicity's sake, we maintain the original notation ei for the transformed coefficients of Equation 10, then total expected return is given by
E = Z_= eixi .

(15)

Similarly, the linearity of the budget constraint of Equation lb is not affected.
However, its coefficients are no longer unity. Therefore, the budget constraint
takes the more general linear form
En= bixi = B,

(16)

where the bi are constant coefficients. Since we have made a change of scale with
positive transformation factors, the nonnegativity constraints of Equation la
may be maintained in the form
x _0,

(17)

(i=1,.*.,n).

Based on Equations 14 and 15, the objective function of Equation 9 now assumes
the special structure

H(x1,

Our problem,then, is the minimizationof the nonlinearobjective function of
Equation 18 subject to the linear constraintsof Equations 16 and 17. Equivalently, and more conveniently, we might consider the maximization of the func-

The problemmight be approachedby the techniqueof Lagrangianmultipliers
if it were not for the nonnegativityconstraintsof Equation 17. These, however,
turn out to be the principalproblem.Furthermore,the Lagrangianapproach
might give us a minimum,a maximum,or neither.Therefore,the behaviorof the
objectivefunction of Equation 19 must be investigatedmore directly. To do so
we shall utilize a geometricapproach.

Function

For ease of presentation,our investigationwill be conductedin three dimensions. However,our procedureis generallyvalid, and its translationto n dimensions is straightforwardand obvious. In three-dimensionalspace, Equation 16
representsa "budget plane". Because of Equation 17, the admissibleregion
is a triangulararea within the budget plane. It is boundedby the intersections
of the budget plane with the planes xi = 0, x2 = 0, and x3 = 0, respectively
(see Fig. 1). For the moment,we shall ignorethe nonnegativityconstraintsand
considerthe objective function Z over the entire budget plane. Let Po be the
intersectionof the budgetplanewith its normalfromthe origin.This point represents the investment programwith minimumvariance. Let the corresponding
expected return be Eo. Based on Equation 15 we may considera set of planes
E = const. each of which representsa surface of constant expected return.

Q~~~~~~~~

FIG.

1. Budget plane

These planes intersectthe budget plane in a set of parallellines of constant expected return,the "E-lines".Since the planesE = const. are parallel,they have
a commonnormalfrom the origin.The projectionof this normalinto the budget
plane runs verticalto the E-lines. It will be knownas the "pivot line". In Fig. 1
we have markedthe directionof the pivot line that correspondsto increasing
E-values (gradientdirection).
If we study the functionZ alonga particularE-line, it is clearthat its numerator is constant and its denominatorincreasessymmetricallyon both sides of the
pivot line. Therefore,the Z-functionabove a given E-line may be depictedby a
symmetricalbell-shapedcurve that falls off to zero on both sides of the pivot
line and reachesa pivot above the pivot line (see Fig. 2). The pivot may be a
maximumor minimumdependingon the sign of the numeratorof Equation 19.
For a given E-line, all Z-valuesare of equal sign. Along the line E = C we have
Z = 0. This line separatesthe negative and positive portionsof the Z-surface.
As long as we disregardthe nonnegativityconstraints,it seems clear that the
Z-functioncan assume a maximumonly at one of the dotted pivot points in
Fig. 2. Therefore,the "pivot curve" connectingthese pivot points becomesof
primaryinterest. We proceedto plot the course of the pivot curve above the
pivot line.
In orderto do so, let us start out with an algebraicdescriptionof the pivot
curve.In Fig. 1 we have drawnthe line E = Eothroughpoint Po, and a parallel
line E = Eo + AE where AE > 0. The distance between the two lines is d.
The position of an arbitrarypoint of the pivot line may be describedby its distance d. t from POwheret is a parameter.The value t = 0 correspondsto point
Po. Finally, let robe the length of the normalfrom the origin to point Po. It
now followsfrom Eq. 19 and Fig. I that the Z-functionabove the pivot line may
be written as

We also note that p'(t) exhibitsa single changeof sign at t = t*. If Eo - C _ 0
the sign changes from positive to negative; consequently,there is a maximum
If E -C > 0, there is a minimum.We thus have the followingresults:

Case I:

the Z-surfaceas definedover the entirebudget plane has a unique global maximumin CaseI and a unique global minimumin Case II. Althoughthese extreme
points do not necessarilycoincidewith the desiredmaximumover the restricted
budget plane, their knowledgewill be importantin the process of locating the
solution. We thereforeproceedto derive them by the Lagrangianapproach.

As we would expect from our earlier considerations, the solution is unique. We
already know that for C ? Eo it represents a global maximum whereas for
C > Eo we have a global minimum which is of no immediate interest to our
particular problem. Equation 35 also confirms our earlier findings about the location of the extreme point. According to Equation 35 the solution point lies
on the plane determined by the vectors es and bi. In terms of Fig. 1, these vectors represent the E-normal and the normal of the budget plane, respectively.

<-----Page 9----->PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL AS AN INVESTMENT CRITERION

41

By definition,the plane determinedby both normalsintersectsthe budgetplane
in the "pivotline" of Fig. 1. Thus, the solutionpoint of Equation35 is locatedon
the pivot line, regardlessof the value of C.
It is interestingto see how the solutionpoint travels along the pivot line as C
is varied.First, let us expressC as a multiplek of the budget:
k = C/B.

(36)

The followingresultsmay be obtaineddirectlyfrom Equation35. For k = the solutionvector falls in the directionof the normalbi of the budgetplane. As
k is increased,it travelsalongthe pivot line in the directionof increasingE-values
until for k = 0 it falls in the directionof the E-normal.Thus far, the solution
points have positive coordinatesand therefore fulfill the nonnegativity constraints of Equation 17 also. For
(37)

kr=

Min, (e,/b,),

one of the coordinatesbecomeszero for the first time. If k is increasedfurther,
it becomes negative and the admissibleregion is left. For

ko= (,

ebi)/(1 bV2),
the solution point reachesinfinity. As k is increasedfurther,the solution vector
moves to the other half of the pivot line. For
(38)

(39)

ko = Maxi (e,/bO),

it reenters the admissibleregion, and for k = + oo it returns to the normal
directionof the budget plane, bi.
The value ko in Equation 38 is of particularimportance.By definition,the
normalbi intersectsthe budget plane at Po (see Fig. 1). By substitutingpoint
Po into the returnfunction of Equation 15 we can verify the relationshipEo =
koB.Thus, by Equation 36, the value k = kocorrespondsto C = Eo. In terms
of Fig. 3, k ?< kocorrespondsto Case I, and the solution of Equation35 represents a maximum.For k > koit representsa minimumaccordingto Fig. 4. The
location of solution points on the pivot line is illustratedby Fig. 5 (numerical
example).
Explicit Solution of Investment

Problem

Now let us introducethe nonnegativityconstraintsthat lead to the feasible
region shown in Fig. 1. ConsiderCase I (C ? Eo, k < ko). If the Lagrangian
maximumfalls inside the admissibleregion it obviouslyis the desiredsolution.
According to Eq. 37, this case obtains for

-

oo < k < Mini e/lbi. For Mini

ei/bi < k _ ko the Lagrangianmaximum is not admissible.To handle this
case, considerFig. 3.
Clearly,any point on the pivot line with t < t* dominatesall otherpointswith
smaller E-values. In particular,this is true of point POwhich correspondsto
t = 0. Since Po is an admissiblepoint, the searchfor a maximumcan obviously
be restrictedto the areabelowthe line E = Eoin Fig. 1. This areawill be known
as the "reducedadmissibleregion".Note that the Lagrangianmaximumoccurs
on the pivot line in positive (gradient) directionfrom Po. We now assert that
the desired maximumoccurs on the boundaryX3= 0. The proof proceedsindirectly. Considerany point P of the reduced admissibleregion with x3 > 0.

<-----Page 10----->42

FRED HANSSMANN

Draw the corresponding E-line. By moving closer to the pivot line in vertical
direction (that is, along the E-line) we can always raise the value of the objective function. It remains to be shown that this can be done without leaving the
reduced admissible region.
The latter assertion is trivial if the given point P lies in the interior of the reduced region. It is equally obvious for border points, as long as the E-line intercepts the pivot line in an admissible point. The only difficulty arises when the
point of interception P1 falls outside the admissible region (see Fig. 1). Consider
this case. We shall have to utilize the following lemma: the normal from any
admissible point to any of the boundary lines of the admissible region intercepts the boundary line in an admissible point (the lemma is proven in the
Appendix). According to the lemma, the normal from P to the boundary line
0 intercepts at an admissible point P2. Clearly, the normal (E-line) from
X3=
P to the pivot line must intercept the boundary line X3 = 0 at an intermediate
point P3 between P2 and P4. Now since P2 and P4 are admissible, so are all
intermediate points. We may, therefore, increase the objective function by movinig from P to P3 .
Having shown that the maximum occurs on the boundary, we may reduce
our problem to a lower dimension by setting X3 = 0. Because of the symmetry
of the model, the reduced problem has precisely the same structure as the original. Furthermore, since by Equation 37 it is the smallest ratio ei/bi that is eliminated, it follows from Equation 38 that the constant ko' of the reduced problem
must be greater or equal ko. In other words, Case I obtains for the reduced problem also (k < k'o). In particular, the Lagrangian solution of the reduced problem represents a maximum. If it is admissible, we have reached the desired
solution. Otherwise we can eliminate another variable. The procedure is bound
to terminate after at most n steps. Fortunately, the result can be written down
explicitly. Clearly, the Lagrangian solution of a reduced problem is obtained by
omitting from Equation 35 all terms that refer to the eliminated variables, that
is by restricting subscript i and all summations to the retained variables. To
arrive at a feasible Lagrangian solution for the first time we must eliminate all
variables i with xi < 0 in the original problem. The "reduced Lagrangian solution" so obtained represents the desired maximum. By Equation 35 the optimal
program does not contain any projects with e/lbi < k but all projects with
el/bi > k.
This result is rather surprising in that it confirms an old and well-Inown deterministic rule for a rather different stochastic model: all projects with expected
yield below a given threshold are rejected.
Now consider Case II (C > En). It will be helpful to make two further distinctions. Consider first the possibility Eo < C _ Emax.where Emax is the maximum expected return that can be achieved with the available budget. Emax
is easily calculated by allocating the entire budget to the project with the highest
ratio el/bi. Thus, we have ko < k < Maxi ei/bi. Clearly, the line E = Emax
passes through a vertex of the admissible region. This vertex lies below the line
E = Eo in Fig. 1. We may now select an E-value between Emax and C. The corresponding E-line necessarily passes through the interior of the admissible region
below the line E = E.o Along this line and below it, the Z-function of Equation
19 assumes positive values. As long as there are any positive values in the admissible region, it is clear that the search for the maximum can be confined to

these. It is also clear from Figs. 2 and 4 that the positive Z-values (corresponding to the region t ? to) increase as we move closer to the pivot line in vertical
direction. Following exactly the same argument as in Case I we may conclude
that the maximum occurs on the boundary X3 = 0, and we may reduce the problem by one dimension as before. Since by Equation 37 the eliminated variable
corresponds to the smallest ratio e/lb,, we have k < Max'i e,/bi for the reduced problem. If in addition k'o < k (see Equation 38) then the reduced problem gives rise to the present version of Case II, and we may continue to eliminate variables in increasing order of e,lb,. As soon as the condition k < k'o is
reached, the problem is reduced to Case I and we may write down the explicit
solution. Clearly, the final result is a reduced Lagrangian solution in the sense
defined earlier. By Equation 35 it does not contain any projects with e/lb. < k.
On the other hand, it must include all projects with es/bi > k since the corresponding reduced problem yields k'o > k (by Equation 38) and an admissible
Lagrangian solution. Thus we have arrived at a result identical with that of
Case I.
It remains to consider the case C > Emaxor equivalently k > Maxi (el/bi).
From Equation 39 we know that the Lagrangian solution is admissible and
represents a minimum. The same statement can be made about all reduced problems since k > Max'i (el/bi) holds. Consequently, the desired solution point
cannot be an interior point of any reduced problem. For if it were, it would also
have to be the Lagrangian solution of some reduced problem which, however,
corresponds to a minimum. It follows that the maximum occurs at a vertex.
It may be found by checking the values of the objective function at all vertices,
that is, by selecting Max, (et - b,k).
The various solutions are summarized in Table 1.

From Equation 38 it follows that

Furthermore, since el/bi = 3 is the highest ratio ei/bi, we have

From Table 1 we conclude that for values of k up to 1.0 the solution of the Lagrangian system lies inside the admissible region and represents the optimal
solution (see Table 2). For values of k > 3.0 the optimal solution is given by
the vertex xi = 30 (xi = X2 = 0). For intermediate values of k we may easily
determine the variables to be excluded and the corresponding reduced Lagrangian solution. This has been carried out for k = 1.5; 2.0; 2.5; 3.0 (see Table 2).
For all solutions given in Table 2 we may compute without difficulty the optimal values of the objective function Z and the corresponding probabilities of
exceeding the critical return C. Fig. 5 shows the admissible region, the pivot line
PgPr, and the location of the various solution points given in Table 2. Table 3
exhibits the probability of exceeding the critical return C for the optimal solution and, for comparison, for a policy of spreading the budget evenly across the

yields a substantially lower probability of survival than the optimal policy,
especially in the medium and higher ranges of k.

Model II: Correlated Linear Returns

We now abandon the assumption of statistically independent returns and
return to the generalvariancefunction of Equation 13. The objective function
of Eq. 19 must now be replacedby
(47)

Z=

-

C)/(n==

si2xi2+

Z:n

J:--1 2sijxixj))2.

The nonnegativity constraintsand the budget constraintremain unalteredas
in Equationsla and lb. The quadraticform of Equation 13 is positive definite.
It is well-knownthat it may be transformedinto purely quadraticform by a
linearorthogonaltransformationof the variablesxi. By a subsequentchangeof
scale of the transformedvariables the objective function may once again be
given the simple form of Equation 19. These transformationsdo not affect the
linearity of the budget constraint.Only the simple form of the nonnegativity
constraintsis destroyed.At any rate it follows that the geometricpropertiesof
the Z-surfaceabove the budget plane are essentially the same as in Model I.
In particular,the Z-surfacehas a single maximumfor C < Eo and a single
minimumfor C > Eo. The constant Eo may be calculated without difficulty
as the value of the E-functionat point P0, the intersectionof the budget plane
with its normal from the origin. We may, therefore,essentially maintain the
solution procedureused for Model I.
The first step is to find the unconstrainedextremevalue of the Z-surfaceover
the budget plane by the Lagrangiantechnique.These calculationsare of course
morecomplicatedthan in Model I, and are not presentedhere.Oncethe solution
has been obtained,we need to eliminateall variablesthat violate the nonnegativity constraints. The desired maximumis then given by the corresponding
reducedLagrangiansolution.
Model III: Independent

Nonlinear Returns

Finally, let us considergeneralreturnfunctions, but assumingstatistical independenceof returns.From Equations 7 and 9 it follows that we should seek
to maximizethe objective function

subject to the constraintsof Eqs. la and lb. For C < Emaxthe desiredsolution
must be efficientin the Markowitzsense. For C > Emaxit must have the property that it maximizes variancefor a given value of expected return. Since the
latter case can be handledby analogy, we shall restrictourselvesto the former.
In general,there is an efficientsolutionfor each specifiedvalue of the denominator. Consequently,the set of efficient programsis one-dimensional.We may
generatea representativeset of efficientprogramsas follows.
Since we wish to hold the denominatorof Equation48 constant,we introduce
a Langrangianmultiplierfor this restriction.We now form the Lagrangianfunction

- X=1 9(Xi).
L(x1, *
Supposethat we fix the numericalvalue of Xand then maximizethe functionL
subject to the constraintsof our problem.The result is necessarilyan efficient
point xi. By repeatingthe procedurefor differentvalues of X we can generate

(49)

<-----Page 15----->PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL AS AN INVESTMENT CRITERION

47

a one-dimensionalset of efficientprogramsxi. These efficientsolutionsmay then
be substitutedinto Eq. 48 to see which yields the maximumvalue of the objective functionZ.
The maximizationof the functionL in Equation49 subject to the constraints
of Equationsla and lb may be accomplishedin variousways. We first note that
we need to maximizea separablefunctionof the variablesxi subject to particularlysimplelinearconstraints.It is well-knownthat suchproblemsmay be solved
by dynamicprogramming.Cord (1964) has used this approachto generateefficient combinationsof discreteinvestment projects. However, as Weingartner
has pointed out in (Weingartner,1965 and 1966), there may be problemsof
non-existenceof the Lagrangemultiplier.That is, there may be values of the denominatorin Equation48 which cannotbe achievedwith a Lagrangemultiplier,
especiallyif the functionsfi(xi) have points of inflection.This matter must be
investigatedin each specificapplication.The solutionmay also be accomplished
by an iterative procedurethat relies on equating marginalgains, and that has
been used in connection with competitive bidding strategies (Churchman,
1957;Hanssmann,1959).
Appendix: Proof of Lemma

ConsiderFig. 1. Let X? be the locationvector of an arbitraryadmissiblepoint.
Let Y designatethe normalvector frompoint X? to any boundaryline, say Q1Q2 .
Thus, point X? + Y is the point of interceptionof normaland boundaryline.
We wish to prove that it is an admnissible
point.
The location vectors of the vertices Q, and Q2are given by

Any point of the boundary line may be written in the form A + (C - A)t
where t is a parameter. Admissible points are characterizedby 0 < t < 1.
Clearly, the vector Y must fulfill the normality condition

From the preceding four equations we may determine the unknowns YI, Y2

eliminatey3from the fourth. The second and fourth equationmay then be used

Recall that B and bi (i = 1, 2, 3) are positive numbers.We now utilize the fact
that X? is an admissiblepoint on the budget plane. This implies that

Thus, it followsthat t > 0. Similarly,

bl2b3x30 < b1b32x10

Thus, it follows that t < 1. In summary, we have 0 < t < 1 so that the point

of interceptionof the normaland the boundaryline is admissible.
