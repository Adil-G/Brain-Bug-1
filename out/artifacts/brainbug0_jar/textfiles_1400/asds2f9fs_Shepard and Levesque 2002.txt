A Search Strategy for Assessing a
Business Opportunity
Dean A. Shepherd and Moren Lévesque

Abstract—The optimal stopping model presented here explores
opportunity assessment with reference to a tradeoff between, on
the one hand, reducing decision accuracy and, on the other hand,
both increasing search costs and a higher probability that the opportunity is grasped by a competitor. From this model we propose
a heuristic that specifies three threshold lines to define four decision areas. Decision area 1 prescribes the business opportunity be
accepted, decision areas 2 and 4 prescribe that search continue,
and decision area 3 prescribes that the business opportunity be
rejected. We use a simulation to investigate the robustness of the
heuristic beyond the model’s boundary conditions.
Index Terms—Decision model, dynamic programming, entrepreneurship, innovation, opportunity recognition/search,
optimal stopping, sequential information gathering.

I. INTRODUCTION

F

UNDAMENTAL questions that must be addressed to
better understand business opportunities include: (1)
why, when and how some people can discover an opportunity
and (2) why, when and how some people can exploit these
opportunities while others cannot or do not [26]. Based on
Hayek [13], Venkataraman [30] argues that the possession of
useful knowledge varies among individuals and these differences matter in the decision to exploit an opportunity as well
as the success of the exploitation process. Therefore, a key
component of the successful exploitation of an opportunity is
the accumulated information that the manager has at hand. This
introduces a number of important research questions: What is
the nature of the search for information and the accumulation
of knowledge about the viability of an opportunity? When
should a manager stop searching for information about the
attractiveness of an opportunity and grasp it before the window
of opportunity closes?
Opportunity assessment represents the use of knowledge (accumulated over time or through current information searching)
to accept or reject a specific business opportunity before the
window of opportunity closes. Two bodies of theory are relevant here—the prior learning theory considers how fast information can be assimilated; and the neoclassical information search
theory considers how long managers may search for information in the face of time pressures to decide.

This article’s focus on how opportunity assessment complements recent research on opportunity recognition (e.g., [11]). In
one study, managers reported that “new venture ideas are a dime
a dozen. Evaluation is the key” [15, p. 34]. While there has been
some research about the evaluation of an opportunity and especially of firms pursuing opportunities [15], these assessments
have been static in that they often ignore the fact that windows
of opportunity can close. In contrast, our model considers two
dynamic factors: the probability that the window of opportunity
will close (so that the firm may lose a good opportunity to a
competitor) and the effects of the accumulation of knowledge
on (probabilistic) decision accuracy.
In what follows, we first investigate models of optimal search
strategies and target those that relate to the search for information about an opportunity for innovation. Second, we discuss neoclassical theory on the benefits and costs of information
searching, and the prior learning theory that the ability to assimilate information is a function of the richness of one’s pre-existing knowledge. These theories lead to a number of assumptions to be included in the formulation of a model of opportunity
assessment. Third, we formulate the optimal stopping problem,
derive a heuristic decision rule, and present implications from
the model. Fourth, we conduct a simulation and assess the performance of the heuristic outside its constraining assumptions.
Finally, we offer some concluding remarks.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND RELATED MODELS
The economic-R&D literature offers a decision-theoretic approach to market entry that best relates to our search model.1
A dynamic R&D investment problem is treated as a one-firm
optimization problem where the optimal stream of R&D expenditures is characterized over time and, if not already predetermined, the optimal stopping time of the project is estimated. Specifically, Cohen et al. [5] investigate the tradeoff between maximizing new product quality and minimizing time to
market. They present a multistage model of new product development and investigate how time to market and product performance are affected by profit margins, length of the window
of opportunity, firm’s speed of product improvement, and competitor product performance, to name a few. They show that “an
improvement in the speed of product improvement does not necessarily lead to an earlier time-to-market, but always leads to
1The economic-R&D literature has been categorized into game-theoretic and
decision-theoretic models. In the game-theoretic literature, reviewed by Reinganum [24], firms compete in the development of a new product. The decision-theoretic approach is used here. Kamien and Schwartz [18] and Granot
and Zuckerman [12] offer a review of this literature.

enhanced products” (p. 173). Lévesque [19] builds on Cohen et
al. [5] and focuses on startup firms where the flow of funding
is modeled stochastically over time and, for a special class of
revenue functions, show that an improvement in the effect of
funding on quality does not necessarily lead to an enhanced
product. Although these models parallel some of the elements
of our opportunity search model—for example, knowledge and
search expenditures—they do not incorporate the dynamics of
decision accuracy on the opportunity.
Chi, Liu, and Chen [3] present an optimal stopping formulation of an investment project that takes an uncertain length
of time to develop and can provide a partial return if not
completed. They also propose functional forms to characterize
the uncertainty and learning potential about the project’s
completion time. Granot and Zuckerman [12] study R&D
projects involving choices of activities at various stages of the
development process. They incorporate aspects of learning as
well as resource allocation into a basic model, and propose a
greedy-type procedure to derive the optimal resource allocation
of a single-stage R&D project. While these models also capture
some elements of our model—for example, the search for
information—they do not incorporate the dynamics of decision
accuracy on the opportunity.
Scholars have long been interested in peoples’ search for information [31]; for example, analytical models have been developed to describe an individual’s search for jobs [29], [33]
and consumers’ search for products and the resulting market
price dispersion [9], [14], [20], [29]. Of great interest to our
model has been the modeling of demand for an innovative technology, which incorporates the dynamics of decision accuracy
([17], [21]). Olivia [22] describing McCardle [21] states: “A
firm evaluating an innovation or new technology starts out with
some information and a corresponding estimate of the innovation’s profitability. One of three conditions exists: (1) the profit
estimate is very high and the firm adopts because the potential
gains outweigh the risks; (2) the profit estimate is very low and
the firm does not adopt; and (3) the profit estimate is in between,
causing the firm to gather more information before making a decision” (p. 607). This process of sequentially gathering information and updating of prior profit estimates reduces the level of
uncertainty surrounding a decision to adopt a new technology.
An assumption of sequential information gathering studies to
date has been that the opportunity is always available.2 While
these studies have made a substantial contribution to the literature, we can make a further contribution by incorporating aspects of the decision not previously considered together: (1) that
the decision horizon may be randomly truncated at any time because a competitor accepts the opportunity before the manager
makes a decision and (2) reducing the uncertainty (increasing
the accuracy of the decision) regarding the expected profit of
the business opportunity by sequentially gathering information.
We now explore the search process further. Neoclassical
search theory recognizes that the search for information has
both benefits and costs and thereby provides guidance on how
much time should be invested in gathering information before

example, McCardle [21] states “the origin and timing of the innovation
is not of interest” (p. 1374).

making the decision to accept or reject an alternative. Fuhrer
[10] suggests that an unspecified amount of information is
necessary to ensure “model certainty,” which is a necessary
condition to form rational expectations. The manager considers
the true outcome to be among a finite set of outcomes, each
of which is assigned an initial probability of being true. This
allows a statistical evaluation of the benefits of additional information: more information resolves some model uncertainty,
increasing the probability of grasping a “good” opportunity and
lowering that of choosing a “bad” one. A good opportunity is
one that, if exploited by the manager, will generate gains while
a bad opportunity exploited will generate losses.
The costs of continued search include money and time (both
of which represent an opportunity cost for a manager), not to
mention an increased probability of being pre-empted by a competitor (the window of opportunity closing). Stigler [29] comments that information costs are the costs of transportation from
ignorance to omniscience, and seldom can a trader afford to
make the entire trip. Search for information should stop when
the costs of search exceed its benefits [16], [29]. There is evidence from research on the learning curve that knowledge increases with experience, but at a decreasing rate, although this
exponential curve is not always smooth [27].3
Baumol [1] proposes that managers’ assessments are based
on expected payoffs. The manager has the choice to accept the
opportunity for exploitation, continue to search for information that will better reveal the attractiveness of the opportunity,
or reject the opportunity (do not exploit the opportunity and
cease searching). The attractiveness of the opportunity (good
or bad) is independent of the entrepreneur’s decision. However,
the ability to make a decision may be lost if the window of opportunity closed. We propose that accepting a good opportunity
generates a gain while accepting a bad one generates a loss. Additionally, when a good opportunity is rejected or lost because
the window of opportunity closed, the manager may be “penalized” by losing the opportunity to a competitor. Such a penalty
represents a loss (a loss from a penalty is smaller than that from
accepting a bad opportunity which involves the added costs of
exploitation). Search costs are not considered in a manager’s
payoff structure but modeled separately. The existing literature
leads us to the following assumptions.
Assumption 1: Knowledge increases over time yet at a
stochastically decreasing rate.
Assumption 2: There is a search cost and this accumulates
(at a constant rate) over time.
Assumption 3: (a) The probability that an accepted opportunity will prove good increases with knowledge. (b) The
probability that a rejected opportunity will prove good decreases with knowledge.
Assumption 4: The probability of the window of opportunity closing increases over time.
Assumption 5: (a) The payoff from a good opportunity
accepted is a gain. (b) The payoff from a good opportunity
rejected or lost because the window of opportunity closed

is a penalty. (c) The payoff from a bad opportunity accepted
is a loss. (d) There is no payoff from a bad opportunity
rejected or lost because the window of opportunity closed.
III. AN OPTIMAL STOPPING APPROACH TO OPPORTUNITY
SEARCH DECISIONS
Conventional profit maximizing models determine the best
time to stop an activity when the objective function (e.g., maximizing profits) can be expressed as a deterministic function
of time. However, in many problem formulations, the objective function depends on the state of the decision system, which
evolves in a random manner over time, thus preventing it from
being a deterministic function of time. Only once the state satisfies the conditions for optimality should the decision maker
stop the activity. These conditions for optimality are found by
formulating the opportunity assessment problem as an optimal
stopping model. In this section, we formulate the optimal stopping problem, derive a search strategy for assessing a business
opportunity, and present implications of the model.
A. Problem Formulation
We formulate the business opportunity assessment problem
as a discrete-time continuous-state Markov decision process.
For more details on Markov decision processes, see Puterman
[23]. Let represent a period and the length (in number of

periods) of the planning horizon. Let

over time. Knowledge at can thus be expressed as
(1)
where initial knowledge, , is (without loss of generality) zero.
By knowledge, we mean accumulated information that allows
one to recognize the value of a new opportunity, assimilate new
information about the viability of this opportunity, and apply
it to commercial ends (adapted from [6]). Knowledge could be
measured by the total number of years experience of the managerial team and/or members of the R&D department (the cognitive science literature suggests that experience is a good proxy
for knowledge; [28], [4]).5 Possible operationalizations of the
model’s key parameters are offered in Appendix D (see Table
II).
Each period the manager must choose to stop or continue the
search. The manager incurs a search cost due to continuing
the search one more period. The search cost is a fee involved
with searching or sampling to increase the accuracy of one’s assessment of an opportunity’s attractiveness. Examples of search

bounded for any t in [0; T ].

scholars) that knowledge increases with search.

costs include the financial expense involved in conducting focus
group research to try and determine whether a market exists for
the opportunity; developing prototypes to indicate technological
and/or manufacturing feasibility; researching trends in demographics, psychographics, and other key market trends. While
there is the possibility that in some situations previous period
search could provide an “experience effect” reducing search
costs, we argue that the information for assessing an opportunity
at a point in time is idiosyncratic and, therefore, search efficiencies generated from experience would be minimal. We propose
that a linear function provides a good approximation of this relationship and keeps the mathematics tractable.
If the manager chooses to stop at period (given that the
window of opportunity is currently open), the new venture’s expected profit will depend on expected gain at and on accumulated search costs at . The portion of expected profit that is due
to expected gain (which can be a negative gain—a loss) depends
on the decision of accepting or rejecting the opportunity and the
accuracy of this decision. Therefore, the set of allowable acis

The payoff from an opportunity at depends on the entrepreneur’s decision and her/his state of knowledge at . We must
thus compare the expected values of accepting and rejecting an
opportunity, where the expectation is taken over the probability
distribution of a good versus a bad opportunity (which distribution depends in turn on whether the opportunity is accepted or
rejected). Consequently, we model decision accuracy by a set of
four conditional probabilities. Specifically, decision accuracy is
measured by the probability that an accepted opportunity will
prove good, which increases with knowledge and is denoted by

tractability reasons. However, the structure of the heuristic is robust with respect
to some changes in these functional forms. For instance, if p
= f (k )
and p
= f (k ) where f can be inverted (e.g., decision accuracy increases
with knowledge at a decreasing rate with f (k ) = k ), then the heuristic takes
on a similar form. Of course, the thresholds on knowledge will take on different
values (e.g., with f (k ) = k , these thresholds would be the square of their
current expressions).

The manager can expect a gain when a good opportunity is accepted, but expect a loss when a bad opportunity is accepted.
The manager thus weighs the risk of a big gain if a good opportunity is accepted against the risk of a loss if a bad opportunity is
accepted; at the search cost has accumulated to . When the
decision is to reject, the manager encounters a penalty when
the opportunity happens to be good, since competitors have access to the good opportunity and will use it to increase their
market share at the manager’s expense. Therefore, when the decision is to reject the opportunity, the expected profit if is the

In our setting, however, the value of the reward function
from choosing to continue cannot be easily formulated as it
depends on whether or not one is penalized from accepting
a bad opportunity, rejecting a good one, or being caught by
the window of opportunity closing on a good opportunity.
We, therefore, restrict our formulation to conditional rewards
that will be shown sufficient to characterize an optimal search
strategy from applying a dynamic programming result with a
myopic property on future rewards. Hence, if the window of
opportunity is still open at , the expected profit associated with
continuing the search one more period and then accepting the

where again there is a penalty from missing a good opportunity, whether because a good opportunity was rejected or because the window of a good opportunity closed.8
The manager’s objective is to decide when to stop searching
and whether or not to accept this opportunity so as to maximize
the expected profit. We utilize a standard dynamic programming
result to derive conditions under which a relatively simple-form
policy is optimal. This dynamic programming result utilizes
conditional expectations that are taken over
and
in (4) and (5) according to the proba. This result and proof of its applicability distribution of
tion are in Appendix A. In essence, this result demonstrates that
one can maximize expected profit by continuing the search just
as long as the incremental expected profit of the next period is
positive, and stop just before it becomes negative. Thus, we can
assure the manager that it never makes sense (on average, under
the assumptions of our model) to continue searching when incremental expected profit is decreasing in the hope that the situation will turn around and become more profitable later.
B. Stopping Decision Rule
We propose a decision rule that has two steps:
Step 1) Has the window of opportunity closed yet? If YES
then stop (there is no additional decision to be made).
If NO then one moves on to Step 2.
Step 2) If

then one should stop the search now with a payoff
equal to

else one should continue the search one more period
with an expected payoff equal to

where there is a penalty from missing a good opportunity. The
second term in (4) is similar to the first two terms in (2), but is
diminished by the fact that the window must still be open, which
7Notice that we choose to talk about expected profit because an expected value
is evaluated based on the probability distribution of accepting a bad versus a
good opportunity.

On the basis of the dynamic programming result utilized (see
Appendix A), the choice of opportunity search strategy depends
on an assessment of the environment—specifically, an assessment of the (observed) knowledge . Fig.1 describes an opportunity search decision for Step 2, and Fig. 2 a “time slice” of the
opportunity search strategy model for that step. Since we have

Conditions (6) and (7) ensure that the proposed structure for

<-----Page 6----->146

the decision rule makes sense.9 Condition (6) imposes a lower
bound condition on the gain from accepting a good opportunity
while Condition (7) imposes an upper bound condition on the
rate over time at which the window of opportunity closes.
The dynamic programming result imposes a condition [Condition (2) in Appendix A] where once the manager chooses to
stop the search, the expected incremental loss exceeds the expected incremental gain at any period following the stop. Since
this dynamic programming result is based on a myopic property,
it is sufficient to verify that, once the manager chooses to stop,
the expected profit associated with stopping the search now exceeds that from continuing the search one more period (induction property). We show in Appendix A that (8) and (9) are sufficient for optimality, where

Condition (8) requires that the expected increment in knowledge from one period to the next be larger than a critical value,
while (9) imposes a lower bound on the per-period search cost.
We should acknowledge that, when (6) and (8) hold, two of the
paths in Fig. 1 will never occur because the minimal expected increment imposed on knowledge will make knowledge too large
(the bound on becomes negative).10
Condition (9) appears to be quite restrictive since if it holds

observed knowledge at any given time period should only be
compared to threshold , which is fixed over time (and thus independent of the expected increment in knowledge of the fol). Therefore, the optimality proof in Aplowing period,
pendix A holds for a simplified decision tree where one could
make a decision of rejecting or accepting the opportunity, but
one could never choose to continue the search. This makes sense
intuitively because our condition on the minimum per-period
search cost [(9)] is so restrictive that it would always cost too
much to continue the search one additional period. Relaxing
this condition makes an analytical proof unattainable. Therefore, we choose next to investigate how well the decision rule of
Fig. 1—which we now refer to as a heuristic—performs under
less restrictive conditions relative to a solution under perfect information.

IV. SIMULATION
Since the sufficient conditions (on the model parameters) for
optimality given by (6)–(9) may be highly restrictive, we undertake a simulation analysis to study the robustness of the heuristic
proposed by Fig. 1. We begin by describing how the simulation
model is built. Then, we present an analysis of the robustness
of our proposed heuristic for multiple situations. Details of the
simulation analysis are available upon request.
A. The Simulation Model
First, we select a combination of model parameters where (6)
and (7) are always satisfied, but (8) and/or (9) are sometimes violated.11 Given a combination of parameters, 1000 simulations
: (1) a Bernoulli variable
are run where, for periods 1 2
of parameter
simulates whether the window of opportu1 if the window has closed and
nity has closed or not, with
0 otherwise (we prevent the window from opening in future periods once it has closed); (2) a normally distributed variable of
mean and standard deviation 1.5 simulates , where
is the increment in knowledge.12 The expected rate at which the
knowledge increment decreases over time is kept constant, with
.13 For each simulation, knowledge is evalu, and expected profit are computed,
ated, where
where

and

These simulations provide a stopping time, a strategy to “accept” or “reject” the opportunity, and its corresponding expected
profit. When the proposed best time occurs after the window has
closed, the recorded data corresponds to that for the maximal
profitability for the period before the closing (we keep track of
how often this occurs to ensure a selection of numerical values
for the parameters that will produce a reasonable distribution of
“accept,” “reject,” and “window closed”). This corresponds to
a situation where the decision maker would have perfect information on when the window closes and, therefore, represents a
“solution under perfect information”.14
11Conditions (6) and (7) ensure that the proposed structure for the heuristic
makes sense. For instance it is possible for threshold A in Fig. 1 to be
below threshold B when (6) does not hold (more specifically one needs
 > (=)L ). Therefore, the heuristic is not applicable when these
conditions are violated.
12We truncate above the random variable X to satisfy the upper bound condition on knowledge K , which is used to ensure that  and  are small enough
to keep the probabilities p
(k ) and p
(k ) in [0; 1]. This variable is also
truncated below, since negative increments in knowledge are not permitted in
our model.
13If T = 4; c = 10, and  = 160, then  = 170;  = 180, and
 = 190, i.e., the expected increment in knowledge from one period to the
next decreases at a rate that is equal to c.
14In this case, the decision maker never incurs a penalty from the window of
opportunity closing.

The objective of this simulation model is to compare the
“solution under perfect information” with the “heuristic”
decision—that is, with the decision rule of Section III in
circumstances where the decision-maker does not have perfect
information. Therefore, we now investigate the robustness of
the heuristic by comparing it to the “solution under perfect
information” when conditions (8) and/or (9) are violated. To
determine this heuristic decision we use a number of steps.
First, we use the simulated time for the closure of the window
of opportunity. Then, we utilize the stream of simulated
, and derive the
values for knowledge,
stopping time as proposed by Fig. 1. Hence, as long
as the window of opportunity is still open, the current
,
expected
profit
[
as given by (2) and (3)] is compared to the
expected profit from continuing one more period
,
[
as given by (4) and (5)]. The strategy (accept or reject) and
expected profit are then recorded for the period one chooses to
stop. If in the interim the window closes, then the recorded
decision for the heuristic is the closure of the window
of opportunity, whereas for the “solution under perfect
information” the manager has perfect knowledge and can
choose the best strategy before the window closes. Therefore,
the “solution under perfect information” always outperforms
the heuristic (with its imperfect window-information), even
when (6)–(9) are met. We chose to compare our heuristic to the
“solution under perfect information” policy because it is a
conservative test, and can thus argue that even a performance
of, say, 70% for the heuristic is good.
The best times to stop the search for both the “solution under
perfect information” and the heuristic are then compared. In addition to keeping track of how often the two approaches provide the same stopping time, we evaluate how often the strategy
selection (accept or reject, or the window closes before a decision is made) is also the same and we calculate a percentage
expected profit difference as follows: (Please see the equation at
the bottom of the page.) We are interested in only the magnitude
of the percentage expected profit difference and not its sign because a negative sign simply means that the expected profit for
the “solution under perfect information” and the heuristic’s solution were negative.15
B. Robustness of the Heuristic
Each measure of heuristic performance is calculated by the
average on 10 runs of the 1000 simulations for three scenarios.
15For example, percentage expected profit difference might be negative when
the search costs are very high and both the optimal and the heuristic models
produce losses. The biotechnology industry is one where even the successful
companies exhibit negative profits for the short to medium term because the
search and testing costs for new drugs is so expensive.

Four time periods are considered
4 . For each of these
three scenarios, numerical values for the parameters have been
chosen so as to satisfy (6)–(9). The major differences between
the three scenarios are the values of the penalty from rejecting
a good opportunity or from the window on a good opportunity
and the loss from accepting a bad opportunity

In scenario 1, both and are relatively small, in scenario 2 intermediate, and in scenario 3 both are relatively high. While the

they are also increased from scenario 1 to 3: upper bound on

, and the smallest decrease in the
search cost per period
expected increment of knowledge from one period to the next
.
Within each scenario, key parameters are increased to test
the sensitivity of the heuristic’s performance. Heuristic performance is captured by (1) the percentage of time the heuristic and
the “solution under perfect information” times are equal (“%
time equal”), (2) the percentage of time their times and decisions are equal (“% time and decision equal”), and (3) the percentage expected profit difference (“% profit difference”). The
results are reported in Table I. It must be noted that the summary proposes a trend in heuristic performance based on five
(and sometimes only four) data points across a specified range.
More simulations and a greater range could more specifically
determine the nature of these relationships, although for the purpose of this paper our analysis provides sufficient indication of
the sensitivity of heuristic performance to changes in scenarios,
parameter values, and measures of heuristic performance.
As demonstrated in Table I, when none of the conditions are
violated, the heuristic and “solution under perfect information”
produced the same stopping time, on average, 90% of the time.
It produced the same stopping time and accept/reject decision
82% of the time.16 Moreover, the mean difference in expected
profit was only 8.25%. How does the heuristic perform when
there are changes in key parameters that cause (8) and/or (9) to
be violated? These are now explored.
Increases in the smallest decrease in the expected increment

time equal,” “% time and decision equal,” and increases “%
profit difference” across all scenarios. Note that an increased
“% profit difference” represents a decrease in heuristic performance for this measure. Interestingly, when only (8) is violated,
the heuristic appears to perform even better than when no conditions are violated, i.e., mean “% time equal” was 97% and 97%,
“% time and decision equal” was 87% and 86%, and “% profit
difference” was only 3% and 2% for scenarios 2 and 3, respectively. It appears that when the expected increment in knowledge
is so small, there is little benefit in continuing to search and it

thus no accept/reject decision can be made. However, the “solution under perfect
information” always stops enabling an accept/reject decision.

all scenarios for “% profit difference.” Due to higher search
costs, we would expect that the manager should stop earlier
and, therefore, it is not surprising that the “% time equal” and
“% time and decision equal” are higher. It is interesting to note
that there is a consistent U-shaped relationship for “% profit
difference” across the scenarios. A possible explanation is that
when search costs are low the expected profits for both the
“solution under perfect information” and heuristic are higher
(and the denominator in calculating the percentage difference

<-----Page 9----->SHEPHERD AND LÉVESQUE: A SEARCH STRATEGY FOR ASSESSING A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

is higher) lowering the difference between the two expected
profit outcomes. As search costs increase, the denominator for
calculating the percentage difference decreases—this decrease
in the denominator increases the “% profit difference.” However, further increasing the search cost encourages a decision
be made earlier, thus increasing the likelihood that the same
time will be chosen and decreasing “% profit difference.”
In the following sensitivity analyses, search costs are relatively low to ensure variation in stopping times (i.e., high search
costs would likely lead to the decision to stop in the first period
and we already know that the heuristic performs well under such
circumstances). Increases in the rate at which the probability of
an accepted opportunity being good increases with knowledge
increase “% profit difference” in all scenarios; and decrease
“% time equal” and “% time and decision equal” in scenario 1,
but yield relatively stable performances for these two measures
in scenario 2. The range of values is too restrictive to determine
performance trends in scenario 3. It is possible that the range
of values used for is too narrow to “detect” trends in “% time
equal” and “% time and decision equal” in scenario 2. It is interesting to note an apparent performance tradeoff in scenario 1 between, on the one hand, decreased “% time equal” and “% time
and decision equal,” and on the other hand, increased “% profit
difference.” The increased value on the rate at which the probability of an accepted opportunity being good increases with

with the possible exception that “% time and decision equal” is

values could more specifically determine the nature of this relationship.

that a low level of appears to provide a boost to “% time and
decision equal” although an increase in rapidly diminishes this
performance benefit with further increases in having little to
no effect. At a low , other elements of the payoff structure have
more influence on the decision, but a small increase in the importance of increases the salience of the tradeoff between

V. CONCLUSION
“When should a manager stop searching for information
about the attractiveness of an opportunity and grasp it before
the window of opportunity closes?” We propose that the answer
depends on the marginal benefit of additional knowledge, the
possibility that the window of opportunity may close, the costs
of search, and the payoffs associated with a good opportunity
accepted, and a bad opportunity rejected. Specifically, our
mathematical model proposes threshold values for knowledge
that determine whether the managers should (1) accept the
opportunity now, (2) reject the opportunity now, or (3) continue the search for information about the opportunity. The
simulation results indicate that the model is a useful heuristic
even when one of the conditions is not satisfied [i.e., (8) that
requires the expected increment in knowledge from one period
to the next be larger than a critical value]. The usefulness of
the heuristic when the other condition is violated [i.e., (9)] that
imposes a lower bound on the per-period search cost] depends
on the cause of the violation—the parameter values.
A number of important industry sectors appear to satisfy Condition (9). For example, biotechnology is well known for its high

<-----Page 10----->150

search costs (expenditures on research and development to determine the effectiveness of a drug and any possible side effects).
The opportunity assessment strategy proposed here would be
useful for biotechnology companies in deciding whether they
should continue searching for information about the attributes of
a drug before seeking Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval, stop searching and abandon the project, or stop searching
and submit the drug to the FDA. However, for those situations
when the relative search costs are not high, the level of other
parameter values must be considered in determining the usefulness of the heuristic.
We believe that this model makes a contribution to our understanding of evaluating a business opportunity, complementing
recent research on opportunity recognition, decision-theoretic
approaches to market entry, and sequential information gathering models. The optimal stopping approach used here reflects
the dynamic nature of the managerial process and builds on previous research that relies on a static perspective and/or does not
account for a window of opportunity closing.

stopping the search now rather than continuing it one more period. Fourth, we demonstrate that once the manager chooses to
stop, the expected profit associated with continuing the search

These steps allow us to develop, under certain sufficient conditions, an optimal opportunity search strategy as offered in Fig. 1.

Condition (1) is satisfied because we operate on a finite

expected profit from one period to the next is bounded.
For Condition (2) to hold (a unique optimal stopping time),
we verify that once the manager chooses to stop the search
(based on the decision rule offered in Fig. 1), the expected incremental loss overcomes the expected incremental gain at any
period following the stop. It is sufficient to verify that, once the
