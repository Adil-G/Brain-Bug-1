QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND LEARNING IN
PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS*
CHARLES H. FINE

Recent interestin productqualitysuggeststhat effortdevotedto improvingthe qualityof
manufacturedproductsmay reduceunit costs. This conjecture-that improvingqualitycan
lower costs-challenges the traditionalassumptionthat unit costs increasewith increased
qualityassuranceactivitiesand has significantimplicationsfor qualitymanagement.
By introducingthe idea of a quality-basedlearningcurve, this paperlinks the previously
disjointliteraturesof qualitycontroland learningcurvesto explainwhy high qualityand low
costs need not be inconsistent.When costs are affectedby a quality-basedlearningcurve,
productqualityfavorablyinfluencesthe rate of cost reductiondue to learning.Thus, costs
declinemore rapidlywith the experienceof producinghigherqualityproducts.
Two formulationsof the quality-based
learningphenomenonarepresented.The firstassumes
that quality-basedexperienceaffects direct manufacturingcosts. For this formulation,the
optimalqualitylevel is decreasingover time, but is alwayslargerthan the optimalbase-case
quality level. The optimal productionquantityis constantif the interestrate is zero and
increasingin time when the interestrateis positive.
The secondformulationassumesthat quality-basedexperienceaffectsqualitycontrolcosts.
In this case, the optimalqualitylevel is alwaysincreasingover time. The optimal quantity
behavioris qualitativelysimilarto the firstformulation.
A key featureof the secondquality-basedmodel is that it resolvesthe controversybetween
the economic conformancelevel model of Juran, which assertsthat one should use costtradeoffanalysisto find the optimalqualitylevel, and the claimsof Demingand Crosby,that
zero defects is alwaysthe optimal qualitylevel. For certainparametervalues, the optimal
.qualitypolicy in the second model conformsto the economicconformancelevel model but
the dynamicsof the modeldemonstratesthe optimalityof alwayspushingtowardszerodefects.

1. Introduction
This work is motivatedby a controversyin the quality managementliteratureand
by an apparentinconsistencybetween the economic conformance level model of
Lundvalland Juran(1974) and casual empiricalevidence on the qualityand costs of
Japaneseand U.S. manufacturedgoods. The paperintroducesand formallymodels a
theory of quality-basedlearning. This theory holds that firms' decisions about the
qualityof productsproducedwill affecttheir ratesof learningand, consequently,rates
of cost reduction in the production system. More specifically,firms choosing to
producehigh qualityproductswill learn fasteror go down a steeperexperiencecurve
than firms producinglower quality products(where quality is defined as degree of
conformanceto design specification,not qualityof the design).
The plausibilityof this quality-basedlearning hypothesis rests on the idea that
producinghigh-qualityproductsrequireshigh levels of qualitycontrol activities.As a
part of these qualitycontrol activities,productionworkersand managersapply to the
productionsystem largeamounts of care, effort,and scrutinyin attemptsto improve
the qualityof the manufacturingprocessesand, consequently,the qualityof the output
of these processes.As a by-productof these quality control activities, workers or

managersmay discover"bugs"or inefficienciesin the system that can be eliminated,
with a concomitantreductionin productioncosts. The quality-basedlearningconcept
capturesthis idea that production of high quality products can speed the rate of
learningin the productionsystem.
The traditional"economicsof quality"model on the relationshipbetween quality
and per unit productioncosts is reasonablywell knownand well acceptedin operations
management.(See, e.g., Lundvalland Juran 1974 or Chaseand Acquilano1981.)This
economic conformancelevel model, illustratedin Figure 1, trades off appraisaland
preventioncosts, the costs of attaininghigherquality, with failurecosts, the costs of
havingproducedpoor qualityproducts.The model resolvesthis tradeoffby prescribing
a cost-minimizingqualitylevel (abbreviatedECL for Economic ConformanceLevel).
Since the model does not account for revenue-sidequalitybenefits(e.g., high quality
productsmay commandhigherpricesor win marketshare),firmsmay choose quality
levels greaterthan the ECL, but no rationalfirm would ever choose a quality level
smallerthan the ECL.

This model is controversialbecauseit prescribesan optimalconformancelevel with
a strictlypositiveproportionof defects.This prescriptionis in directoppositionto the
literature(e.g., Crosby 1979, Deming 1982) that prescribeszero defectsas the optimal
conformancelevel. Underlyingthis latterprescriptionis the belief (which has not yet
been supportedby rigorousempiricalresearch)that producinghigh quality(i.e., high
conformance)productsis always less costly per unit of good output than producing
low qualityproducts.
The ECL model is also controversialbecause it conflicts with the evidence (e.g.,
Garvin 1983, Abernathyet al. 1981) that, in a wide variety of industries,Japanese
firms manufactureproductsthat have both higher quality and lower unit costs than
the productsof their U.S. competitors(even after accountingfor differencesin wage
ratesand capitalinvestment).Althoughno rigorousempiricalstudyhas provenbeyond
a shadowof a doubt that, ceterisparibus,the Japanesehave higherqualityand lower
costs, the circumstantialevidenceis compelling.
The quality-basedlearningtheory presentedhere adds a dynamic learningcurve
effect to the static economic conformancelevel model so that the modifiedmodel is
consistentwith the "higherqualitycosts less" school of thoughtand is consistentwith
the evidence from Japan. In the quality-basedlearning model, higher quality costs
firmsmore than lower qualityat any given point in time. But firmsmay obtain highquality, low-cost positions (relativeto competitors)due to the faster learningmade
possibleby producinghigh qualityproducts.
Dutton and Thomas (1982), extendinga line originatedby Levy (1965), providea
useful frameworkfor conceptualizinghow quality and production decisions affect
learningrates.Theydistinguishbetweeninducedand autonomouslearning.Autonomous
learningis learningby direct labor that resultsfrom the "practicemakes perfect"or
"learningby doing" phenomenon. Reaping the benefits of autonomous learning
requireslittle directmanagementaction.Rather,autonomouslearning"involvesquasiautomatic improvements resulting from sustained production over long periods"
(Dutton and Thomas 1982, p. 43). Models of the learning curve using cumulative
productionvolume as a proxy for the value of amassedknowledge(e.g., Spence 1981,
Fudenbergand Tirole 1983)implicitlyinvoke the assumptionof autonomouslearning.
In the quality-basedlearningformulation,both induced learningand autonomous
learningare modelled.Inducedlearning,in contrastto autonomouslearning,depends
on consciousactions and effortsby managementand technicalpeople to improvethe
efficiencyof the production system. Examples of induced learning are the use of
exploratorystressin the Just-In-Timesystem to generateprocessimprovements(see,
e.g., Schonberger1982), and the provision of rapid feedback from inspectors to
productionpersonnelregardingqualityproblems.
The models of quality-basedlearninggeneratedhere captureboth autonomousand
induced learning through the production-rateand quality-leveldecision variables.
Productionrate affectsautonomouslearningthroughcumulativevolume experience,
as in Spence (1981), whereas quality level is a management-controlledvariable
capturingthe inducedlearningeffect.
We analyze two formulationsof the quality-basedlearningmodel. In the first,we
assume that learningreducesdirect costs of manufacturingoutput without affecting
quality-relatedcosts. In the second, we assume that learningimprovesthe efficiency
with which firms can perform quality-relatedactivities, but does not affect direct
manufacturingcosts. These two differentassumptionsyield two differentprescriptions
for optimalqualitypolicies,each of which may be reasonablein certainsettings.
The remainderof the paperis organizedas follows.We firstpresenta formalization
of the static economic conformancelevel of Lundvall and Juran (1974). Next, the
optimizing volume-basedlearning model of Spence (1981) is briefly reviewed for

<-----Page 4----->CHARLESH. FINE

comparisonwith the quality-basedlearningmodelsthat follow it. We then presenttwo
quality-basedlearning models and derive optimal quality, pricing, and production
policies for each and comparethese policies with the base-casemodels of LundvallJuranand Spence. We concludewith discussionand implicationsfor managingwith
the use of these models.
2. The Static EconomicConformanceLevel Model
This section presentsa static model of quality choice. The goal is to provide a
formulationof the Lundvall-Juraneconomic conformancelevel model which can be
used as a startingpoint for studyingquality-basedlearning.
Before the model is presented,it is useful to distinguishbetween two different
conceptsof quality:qualityof designand qualityof conformance.Design qualityrefers
to features,styling,and otherproductattributesthat enhancefitnessfor use or "utility"
for the consumer. Conformancequality refers to the degree that a manufactured
productconformsto the designfor that product.To wit, a Cadillacis a higherquality
productthan a Chevroletbecausethe Cadillachas a superiordesign, whereasa wellbuilt Chevroletis a higher quality product than a poorly-builtChevrolet,because it
conformsbetterto the intendeddesign.
Conformancecan be measuredas the proportionof nondefective(conforming)units
of output produced by the manufacturing/qualitycontrol/inspectionprocess. This
measureis analogousto the concept of averageoutgoingquality used in the quality
controlliterature(e.g., see Fetter 1967) to referto the averagequalityof the products
that are shippedby the firm. The use of such a measurerequiresan assumptionthat
any given unit either conformsto the design standardor does not. (That is, units are
eitheracceptable/nondefective
or unacceptable/defective.)
As modelledin this paper,the (conformance)qualitylevel in any periodis a decision
variablethatis underthe completecontrolof the decisionmaker.This is a considerable
simplificationfrom reality.In fact, conformancequalitycan be thoughtof as a random
variablewhose variationdependson the level of resourcesinvestedin qualitycontrol
activities,such as the inspectionand samplingpoliciesbeing used. In orderto address
the more "macro"issues of pricingand quality policies in the models to follow, we
assumethat the qualitylevel can be directlychosen by the decision-maker.(Fine 1985
presentsa stochasticmodel of the "lowerlevel" decisionprocessto explorethe effects
of quality-basedlearning on optimal inspection policies and to develop "microfoundations"for the models presentedhere.)The proportionof conformingunits will
be denoted by q (O < q < 1).

Figure 1, which appearsin Fetter (1967), in Chase and Acquilano (1981), and in
Lundvall-Juran(1974), representsthe economic conformancelevel decision problem.
With any given level of conformanceq, Lundvall and Juran associate two distinct
classes of conformance-relatedcosts. The first, failure costs, consists of those costs
associatedwith the dispensationof defective or nonconformingunits. These include
internalfailurecosts, such as the costs of scrap,rework,retest, downtime, and yield
losses,as well as externalfailurecosts, such as warrantyclaims,complaintadjustments,
and returnedmaterial.Failure costs are assumed (here, as well as by Lundvalland
Juran)to be zero if the processproducesno defects(q = 1) and to be strictlyincreasing
as the proportionof defectsincreases.
Appraisal and prevention costs, the second class of conformance-relatedcosts
mentioned by Lundvall and Juran, increase with higher conformance.These costs
arise from inspection of materials,inspection and test of work in process and final
output, equipment maintenance,quality planning, quality training,process control,
data acquisitionand reporting,and quality improvementprojects.The idea is that

<-----Page 5----->QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND LEARNING IN PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS

1305

firms must spend more on appraisaland preventionto achieve higher conformance.
Lundvalland Juran(and the model presentedhere) assume that these costs are zero
at zero conformanceand increaseas the proportionof nondefectiveitems increases.
Let cl(q) denote the per unit cost of appraisal and prevention and let c2(q) represent

per unit failurecosts. (Note that we are assumingconstant returnsto scale, i.e., unit
quality costs do not depend on productionvolumes.) Assume that cl(q) is strictly
convex and increasingin q, with cl(O) = 0, and that c2(q) is strictly convex and
decreasingin q with c2(1) = 0. Also assume, as in Lundvalland Juran, that failure
costs (appraisal and prevention costs) become infinite as q 1 0 (q T 1). That is,
lim c2(q)= oo

and

qTI

These assumptionsguaranteethat there exists a unique optimal conformancelevel
q*

E (0, 1), which is chosen to minimizeq [cl(q) + c2(q)]. The minimizing value, q*,

is the economic conformancelevel (ECL)shown in Figure 1.
3. A Volume-BasedLearningModel
Before presentingthe quality-basedlearning model, we will review the volumebased, single-firmlearningmodel of Spence (1981). This model of the learningcurve
providesa good startingpoint for the study of quality-basedlearning.
Let x(t) representthe quantityof output that the firm chooses to produceand sell
at time t. (Since the model to be presentedis in continuoustime, x(t) is actuallythe
instantaneousproductionrate.) The firm, a monopolist, faces a downwardsloping
demandcurvedenotedby p(x). The revenuefunctionR(x) xp(x) is strictlyconcave
and there are constantreturnsto scale in production,with unit productioncosts c3(z)
a function of the cumulativeexperiencez. Spence assumesthat c3(z)is decreasingin
x, with lim 0, c3(z)> 0. (The subscript3 is includedto be consistentwith the notation
in other sections.)We also assumethat p(O)> c3(0)so that the optimalquantitylevel
is alwayspositive.
Experienceis modelledas a cumulativeproductionvolume;i.e., experienceat time
t, z(t), is given by
z(t) = z(0) +

rfx(s)ds,

(1)

wherez(O) 2 0.
The firm chooses a quantity path x(t) so as to maximize the presentvalue (with
interest rate r) of profits over the horizon [0, T]. For the discounted problemsto
follow, we assume that T = oo. For the undiscountedproblems, we assume that
T < oo. The optimizationproblemthat correspondsto this model is

subjectto

z(t) = z(O)+ fx(s)ds,

(2b)

where the optimizationis over the space of all continuous functions on the interval
[0, T]. Since z(t) = x(t) (where i(t)
dz(t)/dt), problem (2) can be reformulated as
the followingunconstrainedcalculusof variationsproblem:

The Eulercondition for this problemis
r(xp' + p - c3(z(t)))= x(2p' + xp").

(4)

(Throughoutthe paper we use dots to represent-time derivativesand primes to
representderivativeswith respect to decision variables.)Since R(x), the revenue
function,is strictlyconcave,its secondderivative(R"(x)= 2p'(x) + xp"(x))is negative.
To aid intuitiveunderstandingof the model, Spencefocuseson the undiscountedcase
(r = 0, T < cc). In this case, equation(4) implies that ,Kt) = 0 for all t. That is, the
optimal quantity path (and thereforethe optimal price path) is constant over time.
(Dolan and Jeuland 1981 also obtain this result in a similar model.) Spence (1981,
p. 52) has the followingto say about the result:
This is an interestingbut not surprisingresult.At every time, output should be the profit
maximizingoutput,given that marginalcost is the unit cost that obtainsat the end of the
period.That is to say, output will be optimal if the firm simply assumesthe learninghas
alreadyoccurredand sets its outputaccordinglyto maximizeprofits. . . The principleis clear
and simple.

As is explainedin ?3 of Spence (1981), equation(4) and the transversalitycondition,
- c3(z(T)) = 0, are used to solve for the optimal (constant)
quantity.
With a strictlypositive interestrate, the optimal quantityincreasesover time, i.e.,
x(t) > 0 for t E [0, T]. (See Fine 1983 for proof.) However,the sole reason for this
effectis the factthat futurecost reductionshave less valuethan presentcost reductions.

4. Quality-Based Learning-In Direct Manufacturing Activities
Formulation

We will now knit togetherthe ECL model and the volume-basedlearningmodel to
study the implications for optimal quality and pricing policies of a quality-based
learning curve. The results of this section and the next provide some normative
guidelinesfor quality and pricing decisions, suggestsome empiricalquestions about
quality-basedlearning,and reinforceSpence's"clearand simple" pricingrule in the
presenceof a learningcurve.
As in the previoussection, consumerdemandis representedby the inversedemand
function p(x(t)) where x(t) is the quantity producedand sold at time t. We extend
Spence'svolume-basedexperiencemodel (equation(2b)) to a quality-basedexperience
frameworkby representingexperienceas cumulativequality-weightedvolume, i.e.,
t

z(t) = z(O)+ ,fq(s)x(s)ds,

where q(t) is the conformance level of output produced at time t. This model
incorporatesboth quality-and volume-basedlearning.It generalizesSpence'smodel,
insofar as Spence implicitly assumes a stationaryquality level. Hereafterwe referto
this model as the quality-basedlearningmodel to distinguishit from the model of the
previoussection.
With an assumption of constant returns to scale, unit costs are a function of
conformancelevel produced (q) and experience (z). These unit costs are denoted
c(q, z). In this section we assume that quality-basedlearningbenefitsaccruein direct
manufacturingcosts so that the cost functionis given by
c(q, z) = cl(q) + c2(q)+ c3(z),

whereC3(-) iS positive,decreasing,and coxnvex,and limz~> C3(Z)= C3, a positive
constant.In this formulation,cumulativeexperienceaffectsdirectmanufacturingcosts

throughthe function c3(.). That is, with the experiencegained from producinglarger
volumes at higherqualitylevels, the firm improvesits productionprocessand lowers
its manufacturingcosts.
For notational convenience, let c12(q) cl(q) + c2(q),the sum of appraisaland
preventioncosts and failure costs. The function C12(q)is strictly convex and has a
unique minimum at q*. It is illustratedin Figure 1. Under this model, the firm's

wherethe optimizationis overthe spaceof pairsof continuouslydifferentiablefunctions
on [0, T].
As in the previoussection, we will analyzethis problemfirstfor the case wherethe
interestrate is zero, to aid intuitionand to facilitatecomparisonswith Spence's"clear
and simple"pricingrule. Then we analyzethe more generalcase of a positiveinterest
rate. Four theoremsrelatedto problem(7) are presented.The firsttwo, involvingthe
zero interestrate case, show (i) that the optimal qualitylevel is alwayslargerthan q*
and is decreasingover time, and (ii) that the optimal quantity (and thereforeprice)
path is constantover time. Theorems3 and 4 show that with a positive interestrate
the optimal quality path is decreasingbut always greaterthan q*, and the optimal
quantitypath increasesover time while the optimalprice decreasesover time.
The maximizationof (7) with respectto z(t) is a calculusof variationsproblemwith
z(t) as the state variable.With respectto x(t), the problemcan be solved as a static
calculusproblemfor each epoch t. The Eulerconditionfor z(t) is
rc'12(q)+ xc'3(z)= C'2(q)4.

(8)

The firstorderconditionfor x(t) at any time t is:
p(X) + Xp'(X)

-

C12(q) - C3(Z) + C'12(q)q=

0.

(9)

Equations(8) and (9) are the standardnecessaryconditions for an optimun. Since
R(x) = xp(x) is strictlyconcavein x and c12( ) and c3(*) are strictlyconvex, it is easy
to show (by straightforward
differentiation)that the integrandin (7) is concavein z, z,
and x so that (8) and (9) are also sufficientconditionsfor an optimum (Kamien and
Schwartz1981, p. 38).
Resultsfor the Undiscounted(r = 0) Case
THEOREM 1. If the interestrate r is equal to zero, then the optimal qualitypath
q(t) has thefollowingproperties:q(T) = q*, q(t) > q* for all t E [0, T), and q(t) < 0
on [0, T]. That is, the optimal quality level is decreasingand exceeds the static
optimumuntil the end of the horizon.

immediatelyyieldsthe resultq(T) = q* becausecl2( ) is minimized(withits derivative
equal to zero) at q*. When r = 0, equation (8) becomes xc'3(z) = C'12(q)j. Since c3(*)
is decreasingand cI2(*) is convex, 4 is negative.
Finally,if q(t) is decreasingand q(T) = q*, then q(t) > q* for all t < T. Z

the optimalpricepath)for problem(7) is constantovertime.

Substituting4c'12(q) from (8) into (10) gives
(11)
x[2p'+ xp"]- c(z)i + qxc'3(z) + qrc'12(q)= 0.
But since z(t) = x(t)q(t) for all t, the middle two terms in (11) cancel, and the last
term vanishes since r = 0. Thus, because 2p'(x) + xp"(x) < 0, we get x = 0. Therefore,
the optimalprice and quantitypaths are constant. O
Thus, the quality-basedlearningextensionof Spence'smodel embodiedin (7) (with
a zero interestrate)preserveshis "clearand simple"optimalpricingrule prescribinga
constantprice set so that marginalrevenueequalsthe marginalcost of producingthe
last unit. The reasonfor this result,however,may not seem so "clearand simple."In
Spence's model, one can see the result clearly by imagining a variation from the
optimal policy of the form: producea marginalunit (i.e., an "extra"unit) at time t.
This extra unit increasesrevenue by the marginalrevenue at time t, and increases
total costs by the cost of an incrementalunit produced.Therefore,marginalrevenue
at each time t must equal the marginalcost of the last unit so that the marginal
revenueis independentof t and the optimal price and quantityare constantin t. In
the quality-basedlearningcase, the same variationhas a more complex effecton total
costs, since in additionto addinganotherunit to the productiontotal, it also shiftsthe
evolution of z(s) for s 2 t and thus the cost of producingquality q(s) at time s. But
this second effect on total costs is of second orderby the envelope theorem (see, for
example,Varian 1978, p. 267), as it is a firstordershift in z(s) from the optimalpath.
(Formally,this entersthe proof when the Eulercondition for z is substitutedinto the
first ordercondition for x to obtain (11).) Since this second effect is of second order,
the logic of Spence'sintuitiveargumentcontinuesto apply.
The next two theoremsconcern the optimal quality and quantity paths when the
interestrate is positive. Theorem 3 shows that the optimal quality path for this case
decreasesover the entire range. The result is more difficult to prove in this case,
however,since the sign of q cannot be directlyinferredfrom (8) when r > 0.
THEOREM 3. If the interestrate r is positive(and T = so), then the optimalquality
path q(t)for problem(7) has thefollowingproperties:q(t) > q* for all t E [0, so), q(t)
< 0 on [0, so), and q(t) I q* as t -* so. That is, the optimallevel is decreasingto q*,
but always exceedsthe static optimum.

(The proof of Theorem3 appearsin the Appendix.)

This result says that firms with a low cost of capital will invest more in qualitybased learningthan those with highercapital costs. This result could help to explain
why some firms(particularlysome Japanesefirms)have investedmore in qualitythan
others.
THEOREM 4. If the interest rate is positive, then the optimal quantitypath for
problem(7) is increasing over time, and thus the optimal price path is decreasing.

Since 2p' + xp" < 0 and c12( ) is increasingfor q > q*, x is positive. [
Discussion

Theorems 1 and 3 show that at every point in time prior to the last epoch, the
optimal conformancelevel is alwaysgreaterthan the single period optimum. Thus,
firms that do not account for quality-basedlearningpotential when making quality
decisionswill choose qualitylevels that are lower than the optimal levels. The results
also show that the optimal conformancelevel for the quality-basedlearningmodel
decreasesover time. This is because the marginalbenefitsto learningdecreasewith
the amount of learning already done. Most of the learning is done "early in the
horizon." When there is little left to learn or little remainingtime over which to
amortizethe cost of learning,conformancelevels fall to near the short-term,single
periodoptimum,q*.
This secondresult,that the optimalqualitylevel decreasesover time, is characteristic
of many firms' approachesto quality improvementprograms.When the programis
first undertaken,significantreturnsto quality improvementare available,and much
effortis appliedtowardqualityimprovement.However,afterthe bulk of the attainable
benefitshave been achieved,many firmstend to slack off on their effortsand quality
levels are allowedto slip. In many cases, as in this model, the underlyingeconomics
makesthis strategyappearto be the most profitable.
Whereasthis result,that the optimalqualitylevel decreasesover time, is reasonable
in the context of this model, we are not entirelycomfortablewith it. High quality is
usuallythoughtof as a desirableproductattribute,and one would think that if quality
became less costly, firms would buy more of it. In addition, the result, although
consistentwith qualitymanagementpracticein many U.S. firms,contradictsobserved
Japanesepracticewith respectto conformancelevels. Accordingto Juran(1978), the
Japaneseengage in "relentlesspursuit"to find the cause of each and every defect.
Hayes (1981) comparestheir vigilance in improvingconformanceto "pursuingthe
last grainof rice in the lunchbox."Thus,we have no evidencethat Japanesecompanies
decreaseconformancelevels over time. In fact, the exact opposite strategyappearsto
be much more likely.
Such observationssuggestthat the model may not captureall the importantfactors
affectingoptimal quality decisions. We could considertwo types of effectsthat may
play a role in the economicsof qualitybut have not been accountedfor in the model.
Firstthe presenceof demandeffectson qualitydecisionscould reversethe decreasing
quality result. For example, firms with reputations as producers of high quality
productsmay find it in their best interestto maintain high conformancelevels even
after most of the learningbenefitshave been achieved.We do not take up demandside effects here and refer the readerto Shapiro(1981, 1982), Dybvig-Spatt(1980),
and Tapieroand Lee (1983).
A secondreasonwhy the model in equation(7) may be givinga somewhatcounterintuitive result on the direction of the optimal quality path is that the form of the
quality-basedlearningcurve may be differentfor differentfirms.In the model above,
we assumethat what is learnedreducesunit costs, without makingqualityper se any
cheaper.Perhapswhat is learnedmakes increasedconformanceless costly, in a way
that shiftsthe short-runoptimalconformancelevel upward.The next section analyzes
a quality-basedlearningmodel with a specificationhavingthese features.
5. Quality-Based Learning-In Quality Control Activities

In this section we assumethat quality-basedlearningbenefitslead to a reductionin
the appraisaland preventionexpendituresrequiredto attain any given quality level.
That is, the learningbenefitsaccruein the appraisaland preventionactivities.

We model this idea by assuminga cost functionof the form:
(12)

c(q, z) = a(z)cj(q) + c2(q)+ c3,

where a( * ) is decreasing and convex for z E [0, oo). We also assume a(O) = 1 and
limz, 0 a(z) = a 2 0. The function a(-) represents the learning in appraisal and

preventionactivitieswhile the constant a representsa limit to the improvementthat
is possible.Note that c3 is a constantin this formulation.
Figure2 illustratesthe effectof increasingexperienceon the cost functiondescribed
above. The solid curvesrepresentthe qualityrelatedcosts-failure costs and appraisal
and preventioncosts-for the case where z = 0. The dashed curves representthe
quality-relatedcosts for z > 0; i.e., after some learninghas taken place. Note that
a(0)cl(q)

+ c2(q) has its minimum at q*-as

in the ECL model. For any z, a(z)c1(q)

+ c2(q) will have a unique minimum at q*(z), where q*(O) = q*, and q*(z) increases
in z. That is, if the experiencelevel at time t is z(t), then the "short-run"or "single
period"optimalqualitylevel is q*(z), which riseswith z(t).
The analog of the optimizationproblem(7) with the cost function representedby
(12) is

In this model, as will be shown in Theorems 5 and 6, the optimal quality path
increasesover time. Furthermore,the optimal price path decreasesover time if the
interestrateis positiveand is constantif the interestrateis zero. Moreover,the optimal
qualitylevel at any experiencelevel z exceedsthe shortrun optimumq*(z). Thus, the
formulationin (12) yields the resultthat firmswill alwaysincreasetheir qualitylevels
over time, while reaffirmingSpence's"clearand simple"constantpricingrule in the
presenceof a zero interestrate.
THEOREM 5. Let z(t) be definedby (6). For problem(13), the optimalq(t) is greater
than q*(z(t))and increasingin t for all t. This resultholds whetherthe interestrate is
positiveor zero. Further,the optimalq(T) equalsq*(z(T)). (That is, for finite horizon
problemsthe optimal q(T) is precisely q*(z(T)), whilefor infinite horizonproblems

The Eulerconditionfor this problemwith respectto z is
r[a(z)c'(q)

+ c'2(q)] +
a'(z)x[cj(q)

-

qc'(q)] = 4[a(z)ct'(q)

+ c'(q)].

(14)

Producingat a quality lower than q*(z) can never be optimal because both present
and futurecosts would be lowerat q*(z). For any finite z, therewill be futurebenefits
(throughdecreasesin a(*)) for incrementalincreasesin quality, so it will alwaysbe
optimalto produceat a qualitystrictlyhigherthan q*(z). (The cost increasesdue to a
small incrementfrom q*(z) are of second order because q*(z) is the short-runcost
minimizer, whereas the benefits through a(z) are of first order.) For q > q*(z),
a(z)c'1(q) + c'2(q) > 0. Thus, the first term in (14) is positive. Since cl(O) = 0 and cl()
- qc'1(q)< 0. Also, a'(z) < 0 by assumption,so the second term in
(14) is also positive. By convexity of cl(*) and c2(*), the term a(z)c'(q) + c't(q) > 0,

is convex, cl(q)

which impliesthat q > 0. Note that whetherr = 0 or r > 0, the left-handside of (14)
is positive,so q > 0 in eithercase.
For finite horizonproblems,the transversalityconditionis
e-rt

+ c'2(q(T))]= 0,
X(T) [a(z(T))c'1(q(T))
which immediatelyyields the last result.For infinite horizon problems,the argument
given at the end of the proof of Theorem3 is easily modifiedto work here. C1
THEOREM 6. For problem(13), the optimal quantityand price paths are constant
if the interestrate is zero. If the interestrate is positive, then the optimal quantity

PROOF.

+ c'2(q)]= 0.
p(x) + xp'(x)- a(z)c1(q)- c2(q)- C3 + q[a(z)c'1(q)

(1974), provided the constant a, which represents the limit to improvement, is equal
to zero. (If a > 0, the result implies increasing quality, but not necessarily zero defects.)
Thus, when a = 0, at every point in time, firms will choose quality levels consistent
with the (dynamic) ECL model, but firms will constantly strive towards zero defects.
The model also reconciles the "quality is costly" viewpoint with the observed highquality, low-cost position of many Japanese manufacturers. The model posits that at
any given point in time, higher quality is more costly for a firm than lower quality,
but that over time, firms can achieve a high quality, low cost position relative to
competitors by building the amount of their quality-based experience.
6. Concluding Discussion
This paper links previously disjoint literatures of quality control and learning curves
to explain why high quality and low costs may be consistent. The main idea presented,
that firms may learn faster at high quality levels than at low quality levels: is intuitively
appealing, resolves the "Quality is Costly" versus "Quality is Free" conflict, and
provides a partial theoretical underpinning for observed competitive differences between
U.S. and Japanese manufacturers.
Two quality-based learning formulations have been analyzed and compared with
Spence's (1981) volume-based learning model. The principal results are (i) the optimal
pricing policy under a quality-based learning curve is qualitatively similar to the
optimal pricing policy under a volume-based learning curve, (ii) optimal quality levels
will decrease (increase) over time if learning reduces direct manufacturing (appraisal
and prevention) costs, and (iii) the optimal quality level under a quality-based learning
curve exceeds the optimal quality level in the corresponding static, no-learning case.
The latter result implies that firms should be investing more in improving their quality
if they have been erroneously assuming that there are no quality-based learning effects.
This work also extends the standard learning curve model formulations to include
induced as well as autonomous learning. In fact, the formulations for induced learning
are actually more general than the presentation here would imply. The induced
learning concept reflects the fact that, in many cases, cost reductions due to learning
do not "happen all by themselves." Management must often devote significant effort
to make learning-based cost reductions a reality. To the extent that such effort is
costly, the models presented here (with effort represented by q) constitute a theory of
how much effort to expend on the needed (experienced-based, cost-reducing) activities
and whether such efforts should be increased or decreased over time. Thus, the theory
presented here can be thought of as addressing the issue of "optimal control of induced
learning curve benefits." The emphasis here has been on quality as the (short-run,
expensive) control variable, since it seems to be a significant control variable in
practice. But the formal mathematics presented will admit to many other interpretations
in terms of other control variables for the rate of learning.
Managerial effort is one control variable that could affect the rate of learning. Others
are research and development, employee education, reverse engineering (dismantling
and analyzing competitors' products) and investment in better information systems.'

(A.3)

By the proof used in Lemma 1 in Iglehart (1965), P(z, q) is concave in both arguments and

J(s,z')- max M(s, z',x( ), q(*))

x( *),q(*

LEMMA 1.

ThefunctionP12(z, q), the crosspartialderivativeof P(z, q), definedby (A.1), is negativefor

PROOF.

The optimalityconditionon x for the optimizationproblem(A.1) is

F(x,q,z) -xp'(x) + p(x) - C12(q)- C3(Z)=

0.

(A.5)

This condition implies that P(z, q) --x2p'(x),
for the optimal x defined by (A. 1). The cross partial term,
P12(z, q), can be foundby usingthe chainrule:

THEOREM 3. If the interestrate r is positive(and T = oo), then the optimalqualitypath q(t)for the
problem(7) has thefollowingproperties:q(t) > q* for all t E [0, oo), q(t) < 0 on [0, oo), and q(t) I q* as
t oo. Thatis, the optimalqualitylevelis decreasingto q*, but alwaysexceedsthe staticoptimum.

This theoremcannotbe provedwith the straightforward
applicationof the Eulerconditionon z(t) as was
done in the proofof Theorem1. Rather,we will use an argumentusingvariationson q(t) and x(t).

let {x(t), q(t): t

s} be definedby

(x,q) = argmaxM(s,z, x, q),
so that

Let E > 0, and considerperturbing(x(t), q(t)) on the interval[s, s + e) by replacingq(t) with q' -q(s)
+ 0(e) and x(t) with x - x(s) on that interval.Then, for s ? t < s + E, the corresponding(perturbed)
experiencelevel is
z'(t) = z + x'q'(t- s) = z + 0(E).

dV/dq'= P2(z,q) + x'J2(s+ E,z) = 0.

(A.7)

Differentiating
this with respectto z gives
PI2(z,q') + P22(z,q')(dq'/dz) + x'J22(s+ (E,z)= 0.

Since P12< 0 by Lemma 1, and, as arguedabove, P(., *) is concavein both argumentsand J(-, *) is
concavein its second argument(that is, P22< 0, J22 < 0), we get dq'/dz < 0. That is, the optimalq' is
decreasingin z. Sincei(t) = q(t)x(t)is positivefor all t, the optimalq(t) must be decreasingfor all t.
To see that q(t) 1 q* as t - oo, firstnote that q(t) is neverless than q*-for if this wereto be the case,
replacingq(t)by q* woulddecreaseboth qualityrelatedcosts(throughcI2(*)) and directmanufacturing
