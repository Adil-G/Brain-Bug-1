TRUST AND GOVERNANCE:
UNTANGLING A TANGLED WEB
PHANISH PURANAM
BART S. VANNESTE
London Business School
Using a simple but general formalization, we state the conditions under which one
might expect a negative or positive relationship between preexisting trust and governance complexity, and whether crowding out or complementarity arguments are
necessary for such outcomes. Our analysis provides a platform for simple but rigorous
analysis of other possible relationships between trust and governance and also
suggests that the debate about the relationship between governance and trust could
be fruitfully redirected through greater attention to the analytical structure of the
arguments.

long-term exchange relationship (Gulati, Lawrence, & Puranam, 2005; Williamson, 1991). Since
governance mechanisms are not free, trust could
reduce reliance on formal governance mechanisms (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Granovetter,
1985; Macaulay, 1963; Macneil, 1978; Ring & Van
de Ven, 1992). Indeed, some have argued for a
stronger form of substitution between trust and
governance—reliance on complex governance
mechanisms may actively hinder the development of or destroy trust in exchange relationships (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996; Macaulay, 1963;
Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002).
Yet, as Poppo and Zenger (2002) have shown in
an insightful analysis, trust may also leverage
the effects of governance on exchange performance so that it encourages rather than discourages the use of formal governance mechanisms.
Developing this line of reasoning further, Gulati
and Nickerson (in press) have argued that trust
may enhance exchange performance in combination with formal governance mechanisms
(such as ownership), but at the same time it may
make such mechanisms less necessary. Perhaps
reflecting this diversity of arguments about the
relationships between trust and governance, the
empirical evidence has been mixed; some scholars report a negative relationship between trust
(or its proxies, such as repeated interactions—
although see Vanneste & Puranam [in press] for
the problems with this approach) and governance complexity (Banerjee & Duflo, 2000; Corts
& Singh, 2004; Crocker & Reynolds, 1993; Gulati,
1995; Kalnins & Mayer, 2004; Parkhe, 1993), while
others report a positive relationship (Luo, 2002;

In recent years several scholars have explicitly addressed the question of whether trust and
governance mechanisms like contracts and
ownership relate to each other as substitutes or
as complements (Corts & Singh, 2004; Gulati &
Nickerson, in press; Lazzarini, Miller, & Zenger,
2004; Luo, 2002; Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Ryall &
Sampson, in press; Woolthuis, Hillebrand, &
Nooteboom, 2005). While individually insightful,
these studies cumulatively also suggest a bewildering array of possible relationships between trust and governance, at least some of
which appear incompatible with one another.
Trust—the expectation that an exchange partner will not behave opportunistically, even
when such behavior cannot be detected by the
victim—is a powerful alternative to formal governance mechanisms that attempt to align incentives and control opportunism through monitoring and sanctions (Bradach & Eccles, 1989;
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). By limiting
(concerns about) opportunism, both trust and
governance ultimately allow exchange relationships to be formed, as well as effective adaptation to the changes that are inevitable in any

Mayer & Argyres, 2004; Poppo & Zenger, 2002;
Ryall & Sampson, in press; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995), and some find no relationship at all
(Mellewigt, Madhok, & Webel, 2007).
In this paper we attempt to reconcile these
diverse arguments about the relationships between trust and governance as special cases of
a more general framework.1 The apparent dichotomy implied by the “complements-substitutes” terminology fails to capture several different kinds of relationships between trust and
governance that may, in fact, coexist. We use a
simple but general formalization to model three
different kinds of relationships between trust
and governance that play out at different points
in time (see Figure 1). These are (1) the relationship between ex ante levels of trust and the
choice of governance mechanisms (Gulati, 1995);
(2) complementarity—the leveraging effect of a
given level of trust on the relationship between
governance and exchange performance (Poppo
& Zenger, 2002); and (3) crowding out—the influence of governance mechanisms on suppressing
trust (Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002). While the
last two are ex post effects that arise after a
governance form is in place, they inevitably
shape the relationship between ex ante trust
and the choice of governance, if such choices
are made with foresight (Williamson, 1985, 1991).
The formalization we employ makes it possible
to study these linkages between ex post effects
and ex ante choices explicitly.
We begin with the premise that trust and governance both offer benefits similar to exchange
relationships (Das & Teng, 1998; Gulati, 1995;
Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Zaheer & Venkatraman,
1995). Since concerns about opportunism can pre-

vent the formation of an exchange relationship,
trust (which implies the absence of such concerns)
and governance (which alleviates them) both allow a basis for exchange. Further, given the limited rationality of individuals, unexpected
changes in exchange conditions are inevitable;
complex governance and trust both can allow
exchange partners to surmount the coordination
challenges and incentive conflicts created by
change (Gulati et al., 2005; Williamson, 1991). We
formulate a decision problem in which a manager
chooses the appropriate level of governance complexity in order to exploit its benefits, taking into
account the costs of designing and implementing
governance, as well as the preexisting level of
trust between exchange partners and possible
complementarity and crowding out effects between trust and governance.
Formally analyzing these relationships jointly
gives rise to some surprising insights not easily
accessible with verbal theorizing alone. The basic
one is the sensitivity of predictions about relationships between trust and governance to assumptions about the goal of the decision maker. Predictions diverge significantly depending on whether
the manager’s task is framed as one of selecting a
level of governance complexity to match the need
for safeguards and adaptation implied by transaction characteristics (Gulati, 1995; Parkhe, 1993;
Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995), or whether the task
is framed as a problem of maximizing exchange
performance given transaction characteristics
(Corts & Singh, 2004; Kalnins & Mayer, 2004;
Saussier, 2000; Williamson, 1991). Researchers typically have not articulated the nature of the underlying decision problem that they implicitly assume when discussing trust and governance
choices, and this may account for diverging opinions about the relationship between the two. We
go on to obtain several interesting results about
when effects like complementarity or crowding

out are either necessary or unnecessary to predict
a particular sign for the relationship between trust
and governance.
Our analysis provides a rigorous, general, and
integrated approach to studying the complex relationships between trust and governance, and it
allows us to reconcile apparently incompatible
arguments in prior literature. Our analysis offers a
more nuanced yet clearer view of the relationship
between trust and governance than is afforded by
a simple complements-substitutes dichotomy.
More generally, the paper demonstrates the advantages of even fairly simple formalizations in
adding insights beyond those easily obtainable
from verbal theorizing alone.

of formal governance in terms of controlling opportunism and facilitating adaptation (Bradach
& Eccles, 1989; Granovetter, 1985; Gulati, 1995;
Macaulay, 1963; Macneil, 1978; Uzzi, 1997).
In order to model how trust and governance,
individually and jointly, enable exchange, we
conceive of a “production function” in which
trust and governance complexity are the key
inputs, with interactions between them defined
in terms of the crowding out and complementarity effects. The outputs are the benefits to exchange deriving from trust and governance—in
terms of safeguards and the capacity for adapting to changing circumstances.2 We now discuss in detail these benefits and costs. See Figure 2 for an overview.

GOVERNANCE, TRUST, AND EXCHANGE
Given bounded rationality and self-interested
or opportunistic behavior, economic exchange
can be plagued by failures of cooperation and
coordination, especially in situations of bilateral dependence between exchange partners
(Gulati et al., 2005; Williamson, 1991). Transaction cost economics has explored in depth how
investments in transaction-specific assets create holdup situations, which opportunistic actors may exploit (Klein, Crawford, & Alchian,
1978; Williamson, 1985). The inherent challenges
for economic transactions appear even more severe once we take into account the dynamic and
uncertain environment in which they often take
place. Indeed, Hayek argued that “the economic
problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place” (1945: 524). In changing circumstances exchange partners not only
have to account for hazards that were foreseen
but also have to adapt to conditions that were
unforeseen at the initiation of the transaction
(Gulati et al., 2005; Williamson, 1991).
An extensive body of work, including the
transaction cost perspective, has helped to develop the view of formal governance mechanisms (such as firms and complex contracts) as
providing the necessary safeguards and adaptation mechanisms that can protect economic
exchange from the consequences of bounded
rationality and opportunism (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975). More recently, scholars drawing
from the sociological tradition have shifted the
focus to informal governance in the form of trust,
since trust can provide benefits similar to those

The Benefits and Costs of Governance
Governance mechanisms differ in their ability
to mitigate incentive conflict and to enable coordinated action, based on their complexity. Distinguishing between basic types of governance
modes, Williamson (1975) argued that hierarchies differ from markets in that the former feature administrative controls, such as authority,
rules, and procedures. These instruments enable coordinated actions even in situations of
high interdependence and complexity (March &
Simon, 1958; Thompson, 1967). Hierarchies are
also characterized by suppressed incentive intensity and superior monitoring mechanisms,
which mitigate the effects of conflicting incentives; opportunism is therefore less likely to be a
hindrance. Williamson (1991) further argued that
hybrid arrangements (e.g., alliances and joint
ventures), which combine some aspects of market relationships (such as prices) as well as hierarchical structures (such as continuity of association, rules, and authority), lie intermediate
between markets and hierarchies. This ordering
of markets, hybrids, and hierarchies also holds
when we consider their “adaptive capacity”—
their capacity to adapt to changes in the exchange setting that were unforeseen at the time

While such benefits may also be thought of in terms of
the avoidance of costs (such as those arising from holdup,
bargaining, and coordination failure), we follow the practice
of treating them as benefits in order to distinguish them from
the costs incurred in setting up and implementing governance structures (Crocker & Reynolds, 1993; Williamson,
1991).

of governance initiation (Gulati et al., 2005; Williamson, 1991).3
While the preceding discussion focused on
discrete governance modes and their ordering
in terms of governance complexity (i.e., from
markets to hierarchies), it is also possible to
think of increasing complexity of governance
within a governance mode, such as increasing
contractual detail within contracting. Contractual detail is the extent to which clauses are
specified in a contract (Mayer & Argyres, 2004;
Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Ryall & Sampson, in
press). Analogous to the benefits of more complex governance modes, more detailed contracts
are expected to provide better safeguards and
more powerful mechanisms to achieve adaptation when necessary (Mayer & Argyres, 2004;
3

Following prior research (Gulati et al., 2005; Williamson,
1991), we focus on adaptation within the existing relationship, where parties to the exchange prefer continuation of
the relationship over switching. Also note that the apparent
inflexibility that characterizes hierarchy (in the form of rules
and procedures) is not incompatible with adaptiveness. This
is because constraints on individual action are compatible
with joint adaptation. Put differently, adaptation problems
in organizations often resemble coordination games, in
which convergence to an equilibrium is preferable to nonconvergence (Camerer & Knez, 1996). Rules, authority, procedures, and other such aspects of governance that appear to
create inflexibility may guide such a convergence.

Parkhe, 1993). We articulate this assumption
about the general relationship between the extent of governance complexity employed and
the resulting benefits to exchange in terms of
safeguards and adaptive capacity as follows.
Assumption 1: More governance complexity provides more benefits to an
exchange relationship.
Setting up complex governance is costly. For
instance, there are costs for adding contractual
detail, such as the cost of negotiating, bargaining, drafting, and reaching agreement on the
terms (Batenburg, Raub, & Snijders, 2003; Macaulay, 1963). In the case of the choice between
governance modes, designing and implementing more complex forms of governance, such as
hybrids and hierarchies, are costlier than relying on market relationships (Williamson, 1985,
1991).
It is important to note that the costs of governance complexity—in terms of the costs of designing and implementing governance structures of a particular level of complexity—are
incurred at the initiation of a governance format.
The benefits in terms of rapid decision making,
avoidance of costly renegotiation, rapid adaptation, and discouragement of attempts to behave
opportunistically all arise during the period that

<-----Page 4----->2009

Puranam and Vanneste

the governance form is in force. For instance, in
discussing governance complexity in the context of markets, hybrids, and hierarchies, Williamson (1991) distinguished between the irreducible setup costs of transactions and the
potential adaptation benefits, which differ with
governance complexity. The costs of governance
complexity we model here refer to these irreducible setup costs. Thus, our second assumption
relates the cost of governance to governance
complexity.
Assumption 2: The greater the chosen
level of governance complexity, the
greater the cost of setting up such governance mechanisms will be.
The Benefits of Trust
Trust is “a type of expectation that alleviates
the fear that one’s exchange partner will act
opportunistically” (Bradach & Eccles, 1989: 104),
even when it is not possible to monitor that
partner (Mayer et al., 1995). Social psychologists
have found that interpersonal trust develops out
of prior interactions (Deutsch, 1973; Rempel,
Holmes, & Zanna, 1985), while organizational researchers have shown empirically that interfirm
trust increases with repeated interactions
(Anderson & Weitz, 1989; Gulati & Sytch, 2008;
Parkhe, 1993). The information from prior interactions provides an opportunity to evaluate others’ intentions and motives (Lindskold, 1978).
This forms a basis for predictions about future
behavior and inferences about trustworthiness
(Anderson & Weitz, 1989; Bhattacharya, Devinney, & Pillutla, 1998; Buskens & Raub, 2002;
Kramer, 1999; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992).4
If it is present in an exchange relationship,
mutual trust decreases concerns about opportunism and allows exchanging partners to
transact, even in the face of potential holdup

4
The relational contracting literature suggests that besides a backward-looking aspect to trust, there is also a
forward-looking component. Concerns for reputation (Klein
& Leffler, 1981) and the value of future interactions (Levin,
2003) may produce “trust” and trustworthy behavior, even in
the absence of a shared history. Such forward-looking instances of cooperative behavior may be better captured under the label assurance (Williamson, 1993). Our own arguments about trust in this paper are most applicable to the
backward-looking aspects of trust.

problems (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Kramer, 1999;
Mayer et al., 1995). When unexpected changes
arise, trust enables the parties to the exchange
to proceed with implementing necessary
changes, rather than worrying about opportunistic attempts to redistribute gains. Further,
trust enhances the predictability of others’ actions (Gulati, 1995). This enhanced predictability
allows exchange partners to anticipate others’
actions and to adjust their own accordingly
when the need for such adjustment arises.
Hence, trust also enhances adaptive capacity.
We summarize this assumption about the benefits of ex post trust (i.e., trust present after the
initiation of the transaction) to exchange as follows.
Assumption 3: The greater the level of
ex post trust in the exchange relationship, the greater the benefits to the
relationship will be.

Ex Post Relationships Between Governance
and Trust
While both trust and governance provide independent benefits to exchange, there are also
important relationships between them that arise
ex post: crowding out and complementarity effects. First, we discuss crowding out.
The use of complex governance mechanisms
can crowd out trust in the sense that the level of
trust in the relationship can be eroded when the
partners rely on complex governance. Reliance
on complex contracts or partial or complete equity ownership to manage an exchange relationship may signal a lack of trust to exchange
partners (Macaulay, 1963). If one is not trusted,
one trusts less, leading to a lower level of trust
in the relationship (Enzle & Anderson, 1993).
Thus, the adoption of complex governance
mechanisms may directly reduce the level of
trust in the relationship (Frey, 1997; Ghoshal &
Moran, 1996). We call this the “direct crowding
out effect.”
Assumption 4: Governance complexity
reduces the level of ex post trust in the
exchange relationship.
The direct crowding out effect acts to suppress
the level of trust in an exchange relationship
after a governance structure has been selected,
independent of the level of preexisting (ex ante)

<-----Page 5----->16

trust in the relationship. It is also possible to
conceive of an additional indirect crowding out
effect, where governance complexity serves to
reduce the “buildup” or “carryover” of trust into
an exchange relationship. Assume that there is
an ex ante level of trust between potential exchange partners A and B. All else being equal,
such ex ante trust will be positively associated
with trust in the relationship once it is formed.
This is because, absent the destruction of trust,
ex ante trust will simply be “carried forward”
into the relationship. Indeed, trust in the relationship may build up and increase relative to
ex ante levels. In the course of the relationship,
several opportunities will normally arise for the
parties to engage in either trustworthy or opportunistic behavior. In the absence of formal governance, trustworthy behavior will be recognized as such, leading to an updated and
increased level of trust in the relationship
(Anderson & Weitz, 1989; Parkhe, 1993; Ring &
Van de Ven, 1992).
However, now consider what happens when a
complex governance structure is put in place to
manage the exchange. The introduction of formal governance mechanisms can impede this
process of trust formation, since trustworthy behavior is less likely to be attributed to the actor
than to the governance mechanism (Malhotra &
Murnighan, 2002; Strickland, 1958). As such, governance complexity weakens the positive association between ex ante trust and trust in the
relationship. We call this the “indirect crowding
out effect.”
Note that both direct and indirect crowding
out serve to reduce trust in an exchange relationship, by either lowering the level of ex post
trust in absolute terms (direct crowding out) or
weakening the positive association between ex
ante trust and ex post trust (indirect crowding
out). We formalize the indirect crowding out effect as follows.
Assumption 5: Governance complexity
weakens the positive association between ex ante trust and ex post trust in
the exchange relationship.
While governance mechanisms may crowd out
trust relative to ex ante levels, at the same time it
is possible that ex post trust and governance
mechansisms will enhance each other’s benefits,
for any given level of each. This has been referred
to as the complementarity effect of trust on gover-

January

nance (Gulati & Nickerson, in press; Poppo &
Zenger, 2002). To see how this complementarity
effect can work, consider the following: all contractual clauses are ultimately imperfect in the
sense that it is difficult to completely and unambiguously describe the relevant contingency and
appropriate action. Without trust, these ambiguities might give rise to opportunistic attempts to
hold up an exchange partner, which can frustrate
efficient adaptation to changing circumstances.
With trust, contractual clauses— however imperfect—will not raise concerns about opportunistic
exploitation but, rather, will serve as a useful basis for efficient adaptation. In the presence of trust,
therefore, an imperfect clause offers more protection than in the absence of trust, because trust can
act as a “lubricant” that fills in the gaps (Arrow,
1974). Thus, the value to increasing governance
complexity is greater in the presence of trust than
in its absence. This is the classic analytical definition of complementarity (Milgrom & Roberts,
1995), which is discussed by Poppo and Zenger
(2002: 718) as a plausible relationship between
trust and formal governance.
Conversely, trust can be more valuable when it
coexists with complex contracts that help to prevent coordination failures. While trust resolves
uncertainty about motives and helps to align incentives, successful exchange relationships also
require protection from coordination failures (Gulati et al., 2005). The terms of the contract serve as
an important coordination device by encoding
common knowledge (Mayer & Argyres, 2004). More
complex contracts perform this function to a
greater extent, thus providing greater coordination benefits. Similar arguments have been made
about the possible complementarities between
trust and governance modes such as markets and
hierarchies (Gulati & Nickerson, in press). We formalize these complementary joint effects of governance and trust as follows.
Assumption 6: Governance complexity
enhances the marginal benefits of ex
post trust in exchange relationships,
and vice versa.
In the next section we develop a simple formal
model that allows us to explore the joint implications of these assumptions for how a decision
maker with foresight will make governance
choices. In particular, we are interested in exploring how the ex post effects— complementarity and crowding out—influence the relation-

ship between ex ante trust and the choice of
governance complexity.

MODEL
Our model represents the problem that a decision maker (with foresight) faces in choosing
an appropriate governance form for a transaction with another independent entity.5 The
choice variable is C 僆 [0, 3典, which captures the
complexity of governance relied on in managing
the transaction. The symbols t and T denote ex
ante and ex post levels of trust. We describe the
model structure below, as well as how it captures the theoretical Assumptions 1 through 6
discussed earlier.
As we have noted, both trust and governance
mechanisms are potentially valuable because
of the benefits to exchange they confer, and they
may act not only independently but also in combination (Assumptions 1, 3, and 6). We therefore
specify a very general benefit function, which
imposes the least possible structure on the functional form:

B ⫽ f ( C ) ⫹ g ( T ( C,t ))
⫹ ␥ f ( C ) g ( T ( C,t )) , where C,t,T ⱖ 0. (1)
There are potentially a large number of production functions that could be used to model
the benefits to exchange generated by trust and
governance, yet the formulation in (1) is particularly appropriate for several reasons. First, it is
easy to characterize the independent and combined effects distinctly; the functions f and g
model the independent benefits of governance
and trust, respectively, when there is no interaction between them (␥ ⫽ 0). The functions f and g
are nonnegative, monotonically increasing in C
and T, respectively, (f(C) ⱖ 0, ⭸f/⭸C ⬎ 0, g(T(C,t)) ⱖ
0, ⭸g/⭸T ⬎ 0). Further, we also impose the assumption that there are diminishing marginal
returns to trust; the benefits of trust increase
with trust levels but at a decreasing rate, ⭸2g/

17

⭸T2 ⬍ 0. Thus, initial increases in trust are more
valuable than later increases of the same magnitude. The diminishing marginal benefits assumption is common to many social phenomena, and it appears plausible for trust. It is also
in line with prior research showing that the capacity of trust to facilitate adaptation diminishes for higher levels of trust (Uzzi, 1997). However, we later relax this assumption in our
section on extensions. Note also that we make
no specific assumption on the nature of the second derivative of f at this point.
Second, the single parameter ␥ ⱖ 0 captures
the nature of the interaction between the effects
of governance and trust as stated in Assumption
6. When ␥ ⬎ 0, f and g are complements, in the
sense that each enhances the marginal value of
the other. Third, the magnitude of the interaction— complementarity— does not vary with the
levels of the functions f and g; it is always ␥. All
three properties aid interpretation and enhance
the mapping between theory and the model.
Thus, it becomes possible to examine situations
where there are no interaction effects, or to separately evaluate the interactive and independent benefits of trust and governance quite
easily. Furthermore, by changing a single parameter, one can study variations in the magnitude of the complementarity effects. Similar formulations have been widely used to model
complementarities in team theory, as well as
models of incentive structure (e.g., Cremer, 1993;
Petersen, 1992; Siggelkow, 2002).
The cost of governance as specified in Assumption 2 is captured as follows:

K ⫽ h ( C ) ⱖ 0;

In line with previous research, we model the decision
making of one party; we could view the results from the
model as what would be most preferred by each individual
partner—with what actually prevails in any given relationship also being affected by bargaining power.

(2)

Thus, the cost of governance, h, is a nonnegative, monotonically increasing function (we impose no restriction at this stage on the second
derivative). All else being equal, the level of
trust in the relationship (T) is a nonnegative
quantity that increases in the levels of ex ante
trust (t). This implies

T ( C,t ) ⱖ 0;
5

⭸h
⬎ 0.
⭸C

⭸T
⬎ 0.
⭸t

(3)

The direct crowding out effect is modeled as
⭸T/⭸C ⬍ 0, whereas the indirect crowding out
effect is modeled as ⭸2T/⭸C⭸t ⬍ 0, as specified in

<-----Page 7----->18

Academy of Management Review

Assumptions 4 and 5. The absence of direct and
indirect crowding out effects is treated as ⭸T/
⭸C ⫽ 0 and ⭸2T/⭸C⭸t ⫽ 0, respectively.6
With these three elements in place, we are
ready to consider the problem facing a decision
maker who is seeking to choose an appropriate
level of formal governance complexity for a
transaction. We assume the actions unfold
across three periods (see Figure 1). In the first
period the decision maker chooses an optimal
level of governance complexity for the relationship, given an ex ante trust level, and implements it, incurring relevant setup costs. In the
second period, which commences after a governance structure has been implemented for the
relationship, the crowding out effect operates
and the level of ex post trust is determined. In
the third period ex post trust and governance
complexity jointly and in interaction generate
benefits to the exchange in terms of smoothing
adaptation and providing safeguards. The decision maker anticipates what is likely to happen
in the second and third periods, and, therefore,
his first period decision on governance complexity accounts for this. We frame this first period
decision problem in two different ways, and, as
we will show, the framing matters for the results.
First, we consider the “matching” approach,
in which the decision maker forms some estimate of the “sufficient” level of adaptive capacity and safeguards necessary—H (perhaps
based on transactional characteristics)—and
then chooses governance complexity sufficient
to generate this level of benefit, keeping in
mind the level of preexisting trust. This twostep process—an initial assessment of what is
sufficient, followed by a choice of governance
complexity that “fills in” what is still required
after the effects of preexisting trust— defines the
matching approach. The decision maker is thus
satisficing (Cyert & March, 1963; March & Simon,
1958) by seeking a sufficient level of benefits (H),
rather than following a completely rational optimization approach seeking to equate the marginal benefits of governance complexity with its
marginal costs. However, conditional on the
choice of H, the matching approach does imply

a rational approach to using formal governance
to “fill in the gap” between H and what preexisting trust can provide. This combination of
bounded and more rational behavior is very
similar in spirit to the standard transaction cost
economics assumption that while decision makers are boundedly rational in their ability to
foresee future contingencies, they are still rational in the sense that they can indulge in farsighted contracting (Williamson, 1996).
The matching logic underlies the arguments
set forth by Macaulay (1963), who noted that
noncontractual mechanisms such as norms and
trust often provide sufficient protection on their
own. More recently, the matching logic often has
been (implicitly) invoked in the management literature on the interplay between trust and governance. For instance, Gulati (1995: 94) has argued that trust “reduces the imperative to use
equity” as a protection mechanism in alliances.
If trust sufficiently reduces the fear of opportunistic behavior, then there is no role for equity.
Likewise, Parkhe (1993) and Zaheer and Venkatraman (1995) have suggested that trust reduces opportunism and therefore diminishes the
need for contractual safeguards.
Our formalization of the matching approach
tries to stay close to the two-step process described above. The satisficing behavior of the
decision maker generates the constraint B ⫽ H,
which we simply take as given and then calculate the optimal level of governance complexity
conditional on this constraint. The optimization
problem we solve is thus one of minimizing
costs of governance (K) subject to the constraint
that the level of benefits generated by governance complexity and trust matches the level
that the decision maker decides is sufficient (H).
Since the costs of governance are monotonically
increasing in complexity, this is equivalent to
solving for the lowest value of C that satisfies
B ⫽ H. We can think of this as optimization
conditional on the constraint that B ⫽ H.7
The second approach we take is to “maximize” the performance of the exchange relationship with respect to C. We assume that exchange performance can be conceptualized as

Note that, given our definition, it is analytically not feasible to have an indirect crowding out effect without a direct
crowding out effect; it is, however, possible to have a direct
crowding out effect without an indirect crowding out effect.

Also see Camerer (2003: 474–475) for a discussion of the
idea that optimality may indeed guide actions even though
the problem formulation itself is faulty. Thus, the matching
approach presumes optimal choice conditional on the (imperfect) representation of the optimization problem.

benefits of governance and trust net the costs of
governance. This approach is formally equivalent to maximizing (B ⫺ K) and is therefore a
“more” rational approach than the matching
logic, which involves satisficing. With the maximizing formulation, transaction characteristics
play an indirect role in influencing the marginal
benefits of governance and trust; both are likely
to have a greater impact on exchange performance when transactions are prone to hazards
than when they are not. In this approach the
optimization problem is one of finding the level
of governance complexity that maximizes the
difference between the benefits and costs of
governance.
The maximizing approach most frequently appears in economics—and is most relevant in
transaction cost economics (e.g., Williamson,
1975, 1985). For instance, Williamson (1991) has
suggested that optimal governance complexity
(in his case markets, hybrids, or hierarchies) is
chosen such that the difference between benefits and costs is maximized, given a level of
asset specificity. Similarly, when thinking of
governance complexity as the level of contractual detail, one can distinguish between costs
(e.g., the cost of negotiating and writing the contract) and benefits (e.g., protection against opportunistic behavior). Saussier (2000), Corts and
Singh (2004), and Kalnins and Mayer (2004) have
explicitly considered the case where agents
maximize performance when deciding what
contract to use, where performance equals benefits minus costs.

RESULTS
Our goal is to state which of the ex post effects
(complementarity, direct or indirect crowding
out) are necessary (or unnecessary) to predict a
particular sign for the relationship between the
extent of governance complexity and the level of
ex ante trust in a relationship. We first state the
results obtained through the matching approach
and then turn to the maximizing approach
(proofs of all propositions can be found in the
Appendix).
Proposition 1: Under the matching approach, neither complementarity nor
crowding out effects are necessary to
obtain a negative relationship be-

19

tween the level of ex ante trust and
governance complexity.
The intuition for this result is fairly simple. If
ex ante trust levels go up, then the benefits
generated through trust go up; since the required level of benefits remains constant for a
given set of transactional attributes, the benefits
generated through governance (and therefore
reliance on complex governance) must go
down.8 While the intuition for Proposition 1 is
simple, the striking aspect of this result is that,
under the matching logic, the ex post crowding
out and complementarity effects are logically
unnecessary for predicting that ex ante trust
leads to lower levels of governance complexity.
Conversely, one cannot infer the existence of a
crowding out or complementarity effect simply
because there is a negative relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity.
Proposition 2: Under the matching approach, a direct crowding out effect is
necessary to generate a positive relationship between the level of ex ante
trust and governance complexity.
The intuition for this result may be expressed
as follows. In the matching model, in the presence of a direct crowding out effect, an increase
in governance complexity has two opposing effects. First, the benefits generated through governance complexity increase. Second, the benefits generated through trust decline (because of
the negative effect of governance complexity on
ex post trust). When the direct crowding out effect is strong, the second effect may dominate
the first. In such instances, if ex ante trust goes
up (which positively affects ex post trust and
increases the immediate benefits generated
through trust), governance complexity must
change for the total level of benefits to remain
constant. Given strong direct crowding out, governance complexity must increase to offset the
consequences of higher ex ante trust. The surprising implication is that one needs to argue
for a negative impact of governance complexity
8

An alternative intuition is to treat (1) as describing a
series of isoquants that generate the same levels of benefits,
B, for different combinations of t and C. Regardless of their
concavity or convexity, on any isoquant, an increase in t
must be offset by a decrease in C, since the goal is to select
the isoquant that generates the requisite level of B (⫽ H) at
the lowest level of C possible.

on ex post trust in order to justify a positive
relationship between optimal governance complexity and ex ante trust.
Note that in line with Proposition 2, in the
absence of a direct crowding out effect, a
complementarity effect alone cannot generate a
positive relationship between governance complexity and ex ante trust. On the contrary, in the
absence of a direct crowding out effect, complementarity is consistent with a negative relationship between governance complexity and ex
ante trust. The intuition is similar to Proposition
1, since a rise in ex ante trust and, thus, in the
benefits generated through trust necessitates a
lower level of benefits generated through governance. A lower level of governance complexity
suffices (and complementarity only increases
the benefits from governance complexity).
Finally, we note that in the matching model
neither changes in the cost of governance nor
changes in the indirect crowding out effect (for
any given direct crowding out effect) play a role
in determining the relationship between ex ante
trust and optimal governance complexity (see
the Appendix). Thus, if scholars have in mind a
matching model such as ours, they must be
aware that it is unnecessary to invoke either
crowding out or complementarity to argue for a
negative relationship between ex ante trust and
governance complexity. Furthermore, a complementarity effect (of any magnitude) is insufficient to generate a positive relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity.
Rather, a direct crowding out effect is necessary.
Alternately, if scholars use a matching approach to generate predictions that are inconsistent with the ones presented here, they should
make clear how their assumptions differ from
ours.
Next we turn to the maximizing approach.
Proposition 3: Under the maximizing
approach, there is no relationship between the level of ex ante trust and
governance complexity if there are
neither crowding out nor complementarity effects.
Put differently, either complementarity or
crowding out is necessary for there to be any
relationship between governance complexity
and ex ante trust. The intuition for this result can
be expressed as follows. In the maximizing approach the optimal level of governance com-

January

plexity equates the marginal benefits with the
marginal costs. As can be seen from (1), ex ante
levels of trust influence the marginal benefits of
governance through complementarity between
trust and governance (the ␥ f g term), as well as
through the crowding out effect built into the
contribution of trust in the benefit function (g).
Without complementarity, the ␥ f g term does
not exist, and without crowding out (3), ex ante
trust will simply increase the level of trust in the
relationship independent of governance complexity. Ex ante levels of trust therefore will play
no role in shaping the marginal benefits or costs
of governance in the absence of both complementarities and constraints.
Proposition 3 points to important differences
for the role of the ex post effects— complementarity and crowding out—in the matching and
the maximizing models. In the former, complementarity and crowding out effects are not necessary to produce the result that ex ante trust
lowers optimal governance complexity. In the
maximizing model, in contrast, at least one of
the ex post effects is necessary to generate any
relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity.
Proposition 4: Under the maximizing
approach, a strong indirect crowding
out effect relative to the direct crowding out effect is necessary to generate
a negative relationship between the
level of ex ante trust and governance
complexity.
The corollary is that if the direct crowding out
effect is stronger relative to the indirect crowding out effect, there is a positive relationship
between governance complexity and ex ante
trust. Thus, as with the matching model, with a
direct crowding out effect alone, the relationship
between ex ante trust and governance complexity is positive.
The intuition for Proposition 4 is as follows.
Ex ante trust affects the marginal benefit of governance complexity in two ways: through the
complementarity effect (the ␥ f g term) and
through the crowding out effect built into the
contribution of trust to the benefit function (g)—
both via the level of ex post trust. Assume there
is no complementarity effect to begin with and
consider only the direct crowding out effect. An
increase in ex ante trust raises the level of ex
post trust. For higher levels of ex post trust, the

<-----Page 10----->2009

Puranam and Vanneste

crowding out effect of governance complexity
weakens in terms of lowering the marginal effect of ex post trust because the trust benefit
function (g) is concave. Thus, the marginal benefits of governance complexity increase as ex
ante trust goes up. The optimal level of governance complexity is the point where the marginal benefits and costs are identical. This
therefore results in a positive relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity.
Now consider the indirect crowding out effect,
which, by definition, strengthens the direct
crowding out effect of governance complexity on
ex post trust when ex ante trust increases. With
an indirect crowding out effect, an increase in ex
ante trust has two opposing effects. First, because
g is concave, the marginal benefit of governance
complexity goes up (as explained above). Second,
the strength of the direct crowding out effect increases. This decreases the marginal benefit of
governance complexity. If the second effect is
stronger than the first (i.e., if the direct crowding
out effect is stronger relative to the indirect crowding out effect), ex ante trust will be negatively
related to governance complexity.
Proposition 5: Under the maximizing
approach, in the absence of a crowding out effect, a complementarity effect is necessary to generate a positive
relationship between the level of ex
ante trust and governance complexity.
Ex ante levels of trust influence the marginal
benefits of governance through complementarity (the ␥ f g term), as well as through the
crowding out effect built into the benefits of trust
(g)— both via the level of ex post trust. Without
crowding out, ex ante trust will simply increase
the level of trust in the relationship and therefore strengthen the complementarity effect as
well, resulting in a positive relationship between
ex ante trust and optimal governance levels.
Thus, in the maximizing model complementarity
and the direct crowding out effect both “push in
the same direction”—toward a positive trustgovernance complexity relationship.
Again, the differences between the matching
and maximizing approaches are striking. A strong
indirect crowding out effect is necessary to obtain
a negative relationship between ex ante trust and
governance complexity in the maximizing model;
in the matching model such an effect is irrelevant
for the direction of the relationship. In the absence

21

of a crowding out effect, a complementarity effect
is insufficient to generate a positive relationship
between ex ante trust and optimal governance
complexity in the matching approach, but it is
necessary in the maximizing approach. These results suggest that to the extent that scholars have
in mind a maximization model whose structure
conforms to ours, they must be aware that it is
impossible to specify a relationship between trust
and governance complexity absent complementarity, crowding out, or both. Further, an indirect
crowding out effect is necessary to argue for a
negative trust-governance relationship.
To illustrate the consequences of the complementarity and crowding out effects in both the
matching and maximizing approaches, we generate graphs in Figure 3 using a specific set of
functional forms that conform to the conditions
set out in (1), (2), and (3) (see the Appendix for
details). This illustration tellingly shows how
with the same basic relationships (i.e., model
specification) completely opposite predictions
can be generated by simply changing a single
assumption about the presence or absence of
complementarity and crowding out or about the
underlying decision model.
EXTENSIONS AND ALTERNATIVE
FORMULATIONS
While the model we have analyzed has a
fairly general form, we recognize nonetheless
that not all scholars may choose to model some
of the effects in the same way. Accordingly, in
this section we explore the consequences of relaxing and changing some of the assumptions
underlying our core model. All proofs can be
found in the Appendix.
Extension 1: Constant/Increasing Marginal
Returns to Ex Post Trust
In our basic model we assume decreasing
marginal returns to trust—that the benefits of
trust to exchange increase with the level of trust
but at a decreasing rate (⭸2g/⭸T2 ⬍ 0). While this
assumption seems a plausible description of the
effects of trust, it is, in fact, unnecessary in the
matching approach, which only requires that
the benefits of trust increase with the level of
trust.
For the maximizing approach, the impact of
the direct crowding out effect is sensitive to the

assumption about returns to trust. With constant
returns to trust (⭸2g/⭸T2 ⫽ 0) or increasing returns
to trust (⭸2g/⭸T2 ⬎ 0), the direct crowding out

effect no longer serves as a force that creates a
positive association between trust and governance complexity. Recall that this positive asso-

<-----Page 12----->2009

Puranam and Vanneste

ciation arose because with the direct crowding
out effect an increase in governance complexity
lowered the level of ex post trust, but increased
its marginal impact owing to the concavity of g.
Therefore, the conditions laid out in Propositions
4 and 5 become less stringent since the indirect
and direct crowding out effects are not pitted
against each other anymore. Thus, with constant returns to trust, only the existence of an
indirect crowding out effect is necessary to generate a negative relationship between ex ante
trust and optimal governance complexity; with
increasing returns to trust, only a direct crowding out effect is necessary to generate a negative association between trust and governance
complexity (Proposition 4). Note that the presence of an indirect crowding out effect implies
the existence of a direct one. With either constant or increasing returns to trust, a complementarity effect is necessary to get a positive
association between ex ante trust and governance complexity, whether or not a crowding out
effect is present (Proposition 5).
Extension 2: Trust and Governance As
Substitutes
In our model we allow for complementarity in
the relationship between trust and governance.
Now we explore the possibility of a substitution
relationship between trust and governance—
that is, trust lowers the marginal benefits of
governance complexity, and vice versa. Note
that this is different from (and may coexist with)
the crowding out effect, which is a lowering of
the level of trust in a relationship due to the use
of complex formal governance mechanisms. In
our framework a substitution effect is easily
modeled by setting ␥ ⬍ 0, which implies that f
and g are substitutes, because each lowers the
marginal value of the other (Siggelkow, 2002).
With such a substitution effect, in the matching model we find that a crowding out effect is
no longer necessary to generate a positive relationship between ex ante trust and governance
complexity (as stated in Proposition 2); it can
arise from the substitution effect alone as well.
Ex ante trust serves simply to lower the marginal effect of governance complexity, leading
to the need for “more” complexity in order to
satisfy B ⫽ H.
In the maximizing model we find that an indirect crowding out effect is no longer necessary

23

to generate a negative association between ex
ante trust and governance complexity (as stated
in Proposition 4); it can arise from the substitution effect alone. In this model the optimal level
of governance complexity equates the marginal
benefits of governance complexity to its costs.
An increase in ex ante trust lowers the marginal
benefits of governance complexity (via the substitution effect) and therefore results in a lower
optimal level of governance complexity. Thus,
with a substitution effect, at least one of the
crowding out effects is now necessary for a positive relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity (see the Appendix for further details).
Extension 3: Allowing Ex Ante Trust to Affect
the Cost of Governance
In our basic model we only consider the
benefits of trust, not its implications for governance costs. It is possible to conceptualize
trust not only as acting to mitigate the effects
of opportunism and enable adaptation (as in
our model) but as acting to lower the marginal
cost of governance complexity as well. In other
words, ex ante trust could make the setting up
of governance itself less costly, for any level of
governance complexity. We can modify the
model to allow for the existing level of trust to
lower the marginal cost of governance complexity (h⬙C,t ⬍ 0).
As before, the results in the matching model
are unaffected, since the costs of governance do
not feature in that model directly. In the maximizing model Propositions 3 and 5 are modified.
In the absence of both complementarity and
crowding out effects, there will now be a positive association between ex ante trust and governance complexity (Proposition 3) so that the
complementarity effect is not necessary to generate such an association in the maximizing model
(Proposition 5). This is not very surprising, because
allowing ex ante trust to lower the marginal cost
of governance complexity is analytically equivalent to an additional complementarity effect between ex ante trust and governance complexity:
trust enhances the marginal effect of governance
complexity on exchange performance.
In the preceding analysis of alternative formulations, we were careful to note how our
propositions stated in the previous section
change, in order to make transparent the as-

<-----Page 13----->24

Academy of Management Review

sumptions on which our results depended.
However, the analysis here confirms the robustness of our fundamental point—that the
choice of the underlying optimization model
(matching or maximizing) matters greatly. An
obvious illustration of this point is that the
changes we introduce in the model with each
extension above have different (and often opposite) implications for the matching and maximizing models. Further, the analysis also
shows how our model structure is flexible
enough to serve as a platform to explore alternative formulations of the relationships between trust and governance. For instance,
crowding in effects—such that governance
complexity might encourage the formation of
trust (Grundei, 2006)— can also be easily accommodated in our model.
DISCUSSION
The relationships between trust and formal
governance are both fascinating and convoluted. While an increasing number of scholars
are asking whether trust and governance are
complements or substitutes (Corts & Singh, 2004;
Gulati & Nickerson, in press; Lazzarini et al.,
2004; Luo, 2002; Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Ryall &
Sampson, in press; Woolthuis et al., 2005), the
possible relationships between them are richer
than this dichotomization. Besides making the
case that we have learned as much as we can
from empirical studies that simply ask if trust
and governance are complements or substitutes,
our analysis takes three important steps toward
enhancing our understanding of the relationships between trust and governance.
First, we point to different basic types of relationships between trust and governance, which
may, however, coexist: trust may enhance the
effect of governance on exchange performance
(complementarity), governance may reduce the
level of trust between exchange partners
(through direct or indirect crowding out), and ex
ante trust may influence the choice of governance complexity. Our analysis focuses on
showing how the endogenous relationship between ex ante trust and governance is affected
by the two exogenous and ex post relationships—the crowding out and the complementarity effects. In our extensions we also considered
the possibility of substitution between trust and
governance complexity, as well as the impact of

January

trust on the cost of governance. The dichotomous
complements-substitutes characterization masks
this variety of possible relationships and can only
lead to terminological confusion. We therefore
hope that our work encourages scholars to clearly
specify the underlying mechanisms they invoke
when proposing particular relationships between
trust and governance complexity.
Second, we also draw attention to the need for
clarity about the logic underlying the optimization problem that decision makers implicitly
face when making governance choices. As we
show, the maximizing and the matching models
lead to very different predictions about the
relationships between ex ante trust and governance complexity. This difference fundamentally arises from the fact that, in the matching
approach, the decision maker equates the level
of benefits generated through trust and governance to the perceived need for such benefits in
the form of safeguards and adaptation implied
by transaction characteristics; in the maximizing model the decision maker equates the marginal benefits and marginal costs of governance
complexity. Given the diversity of reported empirical results on the nature of the relationship
between ex ante trust and governance complexity, we hope we have persuaded scholars that
articulating the nature of the underlying decision-making model—matching or maximizing
—is critical for any meaningful aggregation of
results, and even debate among scholars. Further setting aside the empirical question of
which of the two models has better explanatory
power, there may also be fruitful opportunities
for assessing their relative behavioral plausibility, perhaps in laboratory settings.
Third, our analysis helps us to formally state
and prove which effects are necessary (or unnecessary) to generate positive and negative
relationships between ex ante trust and governance complexity. To obtain a negative trustgovernance relationship, neither crowding out
nor complementarity is necessary in the matching model, whereas a strong indirect crowding
out effect relative to the direct crowding out effect is necessary in the maximizing model. In fact,
in the maximizing model either a complementarity or crowding out effect is necessary for any
trust-governance relationship. To obtain a positive trust-governance relationship, a direct crowding out effect is necessary in the matching model,
and a complementarity or direct crowding out ef-

<-----Page 14----->2009

Puranam and Vanneste

fect is necessary in the maximizing model. As can
be seen, these conditions vary significantly across
the matching and maximizing models, and (at
least to us) were not obvious prior to our analysis.
We hope these results will be helpful to scholars
both in strengthening the rationale for their arguments about the expected relationships between
trust and governance complexity and in interpreting their empirical findings appropriately. Of
course, as is always the case with a formal theorizing exercise, it is certainly possible to formulate
other models with different assumptions, which
will also lead to different results. However, we
believe that our analysis serves the valuable purpose of sensitizing scholars to the need for explicitly altering the structure of the model in order to
reach different conclusions.
As evidence of the flexibility of our model
structure for exploring such variations, we have
ourselves analyzed some extensions to our basic
model, such as allowing for constant/increasing
returns to trust, assuming a substitution effect between trust and governance, and allowing trust
to lower governance costs. While some of the results alter as a consequence, others remain unchanged, and the overall pattern of results continues to show a sharp difference between the
matching and maximizing approaches. In addition to this analytical flexibility, our model structure also lends itself to some interpretive flexibility. For instance, while our results are based on
the assumption of (conditionally) optimal decision
making informed by knowledge of the complementarity and crowding out effects, they also can
be used to compare the choices of a decision
maker who is “blind” to certain effects with the
optimal choices (e.g., in the matching model the
choices of a decision maker who ignores the direct
crowding out effect will show a negative association between trust and governance, whereas it
should be a positive one).
Our model also lends itself to exploration into
how trust and governance may coevolve over
time. In additional simulations (not reported
here), we took the resulting levels of ex post trust
in the relationship in period n as the ex ante
level of trust in period n ⫹ 1, to see how trust and
governance complexity change over time.9 We
found two basic patterns. First, in situations

9
Note that the decision maker still optimizes only during
each period rather than across multiple periods.

25

with a positive association between ex ante
trust and governance complexity (e.g., only direct crowding out in matching or maximizing),
trust and governance complexity move in the
same direction over time. Note that this does not
imply that both will increase; they could also
decline together. Second, when a negative relationship is present between ex ante trust and
governance complexity (e.g., only complementarity in matching or strong indirect crowding
out in maximizing), trust and governance complexity move in opposite directions over time.
Again, in such situations trust could increase or
decrease, as long as governance complexity
moves in the opposite direction. Finally, the relationship between ex ante trust and governance complexity may itself change over time
as a result of changes in trust levels (which
influence the magnitude of the crowding out
effects when present). We hope that the possibility of doing this kind of analysis encourages
other scholars to explore these ideas further.
In addition to clarifying theorizing about trust
and governance, our results can help with interpreting empirical findings, as well as with specifying better empirical tests. For instance, some
scholars might argue that a crowding out effect
is implausible in the real world, while others
may question the basis for complementarity.
Our model is useful to both, demonstrating what
the results would be in the absence of each
effect individually. Thus, by arguing for the existence or absence of effects such as crowding
out and complementarity, one can make rigorously derived, competing predictions about the
expected sign of the relationship between trust
and governance complexity.10
However, an additional interesting direction
for research might be to move concepts such as
crowding out and complementarity out of the
category of unobserved mechanisms, to explicit
moderators that change the sign of the relationship between trust and governance. Thus, instead of simply looking for relationships between trust and governance complexity, scholars
could also attempt to exploit sources of variation in the magnitudes of the complementarity
10

Our results are about the association between ex ante
trust and governance complexity. Because the relationship between ex ante trust and ex post trust is always positive, the
sign of the relationship between ex post trust and governance
complexity is the same as that of the one we studied.

<-----Page 15----->26

and crowding out effects. Such an approach
could go a long way toward reconciling apparently disparate prior results—if the differences
could be shown to arise from differences in the
crowding out and complementarity effects across
the samples of different studies. In order to encourage progress in this direction, in Table 1 we
present an attempt to map the effects studied in
our model to possible empirical indicators. We
focus on the three key parameters of interest in our
model: the direct and indirect crowding out effects
and the complementarity effect.
We have argued that governance mechanisms may crowd out trust because the reliance
on governance may be seen as a signal of distrust. Thus, we would expect the crowding out
effect to be stronger when the perceived signal
is stronger, and the signal of distrust may be
stronger if it is common practice to not use any
governance mechanism. For example, certain
markets rely on handshakes rather than written
agreements to close deals. Insisting on a contract in such instances will rapidly crowd out
trust. We have also argued that an indirect
crowding out effect could arise when trust development is hampered because of the attribution of trustworthy behavior to the contract. Such
misattribution may be less likely when the partners to the exchange share a sophisticated understanding of the strengths and limits of formal
governance (e.g., in the form of legal expertise).
Trust may complement governance mechanisms when it is impossible to specify all contingencies ex ante. Thus, we expect the complementarity effect to be stronger in situations of
uncertainty and volatility. Furthermore, trust
complements agreements in the sense that

January

clauses that are nonenforceable in courts are
upheld within the relationship. In part, such
agreements may provide necessary coordination mechanisms that enhance exchange performance (Mayer & Argyres, 2004). This latter effect
should be stronger when the need for coordination between exchange partners is high—for example, in situations of high interdependence between them (Gulati et al., 2005; Thompson, 1967).
We also recognize the limitations to our research. As with all attempts at formal analysis, we
trade off analytical rigor against realism rather
explicitly. We assume (conditionally) optimizing
behavior by a decision maker who is fully informed about the values of the various parameters
in the model. Also, in the tradition of transaction
cost economics (Williamson, 1975, 1985), as well as
research inspired by it that (implicitly or explicitly)
treats parties’ governance preferences as similar
(e.g., Crocker & Reynolds, 1993), we focus on the
decisions of one party; we could view the results
from the model as (1) describing the behavior of a
disinterested designer who takes the preferences
of both parties into account or (2) what would be
most preferred by each individual partner—with
what actually prevails in any given relationship
being also affected by bargaining power (Grossman & Hart, 1986).
We also focus explicitly on trust transformation during the exchange and take ex ante trust
levels as given. As a direct consequence of this
choice, we are not concerned in this paper with
assurance effects arising from the potential
value of future interactions, which may have
results similar to those of trust. Our analysis,
despite its incorporation of ex post effects into
ex ante optimization, is still somewhat static in

Formal contracts are not common practice—The act of proposing a contract can be
perceived as a signal of distrust when trusting individuals propose contracts.
The perceived signal strength of distrust should be greater the less common the
use of a contract is.
Parties to the exchange lack legal expertise—In such situations, the growth of
trust in the relationship may be hampered because of misattributions about
cooperative behavior as having arisen from governance rather than from
trustworthy behavior.
Ambiguity surrounding exchange is higher—Trust leverages the value of contracts
if they are incompletely specified because of ambiguity. If ambiguity is higher,
then the complementarity effect should be stronger.

the sense that we do not model the development of
trust over time in the relationship. However, our
analysis should still yield directionally correct results since the formulation of the static crowding
out effect we have modeled would still be appropriate even if trust in the relationship increased
not only with ex ante trust but also with the duration of the relationship. Yet an explicitly dynamic
formulation of this trust generation process would
doubtless have advantages in terms of tracing the
time paths of trust development.
In the interest of analytical tractability, we
have modeled governance complexity as a continuous variable. This maps most closely onto
formal governance through contracts, which can
be of greater or lesser levels of complexity and
detail. However, we believe our results are also
relevant to the case of discrete governance
modes—such as the choice among market, hybrid, and hierarchy—for two reasons. First, the
discreteness of these modes may well be primarily a matter of categorization. As many
scholars have noted, hierarchical elements are
found in markets, market elements in hierarchies, and both in hybrids (Bradach & Eccles,
1989). Thus, while contracts exist between independent firms of various levels of detail and
ownership links exist between firms of various
levels of equity (Kale & Puranam, 2004), this is
not inconsistent with a useful definition of ideal
types such as markets, hybrids, and hierarchies.
Second, in practice, most studies that predict
the choice between discrete governance modes
rest on underlying mechanisms that are continuous. For example, increases in transaction hazards require increases in governance safeguards.
This leads to predictions about the likelihood of a
discrete choice through a latent variable (e.g., in
probit or logit models). Our continuous variable,
governance complexity, can be thought of as such
a latent variable. For these reasons, we believe
that our results on governance complexity as a
continuous variable should be broadly applicable
to the choice of discrete governance modes of increasing levels of complexity.
Despite these limitations, we believe that this
paper makes progress toward untangling the
complex web of relationships linking trust and
governance. Our goal has been to use the simplest and most general formulation possible to
make the basic point at the focus of this paper—that
the “simple” dichotomization of the relationships between trust and governance into “com-

27

plements” and “substitutes” obscures and confuses more than it simplifies and clarifies.

In the absence of complementarity

Therefore, neither effect is necessary
to generate this negative relationship.

In the absence of crowding out and

In the absence of crowding out effects,
a complementarity effect is necessary
(and any magnitude of complementarity effect is sufficient) for a positive
relationship between ex ante trust
and governance complexity.
