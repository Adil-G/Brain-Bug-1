a b s t r a c t
Using 150 interactions between entrepreneurs and potential investors, we study early stage
business angel decision making. We show that contrary to the majority of past research that
suggests they should, angel investors do not use a fully compensatory decision model wherein
they weight and score a large number of attributes. Rather, they use a shortcut decision making
heuristic known as elimination-by-aspects to reduce the available investment opportunities to
a more manageable size. If an opportunity is diagnosed with a fatal ﬂaw, it is rejected in the ﬁrst
stage of the decision making process, but all opportunities with no fatal ﬂaws do progress
beyond that stage.

1. Executive summary
Business angels (BAs) are private investors who provide risk capital to new and growing businesses in which they have no
family connection (Mason and Harrison, 1995). They invest 16 times as often in seed ventures than do venture capitalists (VCs)
(Sohl, 2007). In 2008, BAs invested $19.2 billion in the U.S. of which 45% was in early stage ventures (Sohl, 2009). This was 27%
more than VCs invested in early stage ventures (PWC Moneytree, 2009). VCs tend to invest in ventures at later development stages
since they offer shorter exit cycles and lower perceived levels of risk (Sapienza et al., 1996). Because of this, BAs are much more
important investors in the early stages. As articulated by Madill et al. (2005), since existing investment from BAs is often a prerequisite for obtaining investment from VCs, increasing the number of business ventures that receive funding from BAs is of
interest to all potential investors.
Because of the importance of BAs in early funding, we focus only on them, and not on VCs. We are not concerned with the
differences in decision making between BAs and VCs, rather, we want to examine BA decision making in order to better
understand the process. Around 97% of the ventures seeking investment fail to attract funding in Canada (Riding et al., 1997).
Similar low rates have been echoed in the U.S. and the U.K., which has led Riding et al. (2007) to call for more research on how BAs
arrive at their investment decisions. Further, as the creation and ﬁnancing of business ventures have important regional economic
beneﬁts, we follow the call of Freear et al. (2002) and investigate this decision process to offer recommendations for increasing its
efﬁciency.
We test two hypotheses by analyzing recordings of the interactions between entrepreneurs and BAs from the Canadian version
of the reality TV show “Dragons' Den.“ In the ﬁrst hypothesis we postulate that BAs use elimination-by-aspects (Tversky, 1972), a
non-compensatory decision making heuristic, to trim the set of opportunities looking for investment. In the second we

hypothesize that, once the set of business opportunities looking for investment has been trimmed, BAs consider different factors
and use different decision making processes.
Our ﬁndings suggest that both of our hypotheses be supported. In other words, using a more parsimonious set of criteria (the
eight critical factors: product adoption, product status, protectability, customer engagement, route to market, market potential,
relevant experience, or ﬁnancial model) we show that the BAs do not use a fully compensatory model, although the extant
literature suggests that they should. We also challenge the way people think about BAs' investment decisions by showing that the
factors that are initially considered critical in the investment decision process are not necessarily used in the ﬁnal decision of
whether or not to fund a business opportunity. We further contribute methodologically by employing an observational interaction
technique that enables us to reduce possible biases by observing behaviors rather than relying on BAs' recollections. In examining
the early stage of the decision process, we focus on reasons for rejection rather than reasons for choosing to gather additional
insights on the factors that can differentiate between receiving, or not, funding.
This research is thus novel in that we are able to observe the decision process, identify speciﬁc critical factors, and begin to
break down a complex process into stages. In doing so, we demonstrate a shortcoming of previous theoretical research, which only
focuses on the criteria evaluated rather than the process by which they are evaluated. We use social psychology and decision
making studies to explore the relative importance of speciﬁc factors at the early stage of the BA investment process. By providing a
more comprehensive approach to the identiﬁcation of critical factors, based on a unique data set of real interactions, we believe
that our insights will be of interest to those academics and practitioners confused by the laundry list of factors identiﬁed in much
previous research (e.g., Stedler and Peters, 2003; Sudek, 2006).
Moreover, an improved understanding of the factors used to trim the set of business opportunities looking for investment can
increase an entrepreneur's likelihood of achieving funding because they can ﬁnd ways to reduce the causes for rejections prior to
pitching their ideas to a potential investor. An increased awareness of decision processes once the set of business opportunities
looking for investment has been trimmed can help BAs improve the efﬁciency of their own decision heuristics. The number of
business ventures that receive funding will likely increase because more entrepreneurs and BAs will be willing to engage in
investment interactions.
2. Introduction
Landström (1998) points out that “[t]here are few studies which have attempted to bring out the nuances in informal investors'
decision making criteria” and suggests the development of studies that consider “investment as a process in which decision
making criteria may vary in the course of time” (p. 322). The complexity of the investment decision process can be better
understood if that process is broken down into stages. Focusing on those during the interaction between investor and
entrepreneur, we can consider two distinct stages. First is what we will call a selection stage1, where potential inventors determine
if consideration will continue. The second stage is post-selection, which would include a more thorough assessment and a
potential negotiation where a ﬁnal decision on whether to fund or not would occur. Mason and Harrison (2002) stress that
focusing on how decisions are made to allow an opportunity to proceed to the next stage of the process enables one to increase
process efﬁciencies and hence the chances of a successful investment.
In this paper we concentrate on the selection stage. That is, the ﬁrst stage in the investment decision process that also
corresponds to the stage with the highest rejection rate (Riding et al., 1997). We ask: How do BAs trim the set of potential business
opportunities at the selection stage and once this decision set is trimmed, is a different set of criteria used to make a decision at the
subsequent investment stages? We thus attempt to identify how potential investors ﬁlter out the small percentage of business
opportunities that are considered more thoroughly in stages beyond selection. We explore this question by analyzing a small set of
interactions between entrepreneurs and BAs from the Canadian version of a reality TV show known as “Dragons' Den.” We analyze
recordings of the interactions, which allow us to identify a clear “selection stage” and then determine a speciﬁc decision heuristic
used by BAs at this stage of the investment decision process.
Most of the past literature on BA decision making has listed numerous factors that BAs consider when making a funding
decision. For example, van Osnabrugge (2000) outlined more than 20 characteristics that possible inventors would examine
before making a decision. Other research has also followed this pattern (e.g., Bachher and Guild, 1996; Feeney et al., 1999; Haar
et al., 1988; Haines et al., 2003; Landström, 1998; Paul et al., 2007; Sudek, 2006). Although much of that research has followed
economists and decision analysts by putting forward models of how these funding decisions should be made, past behavioral
research has proven to be much more accurate at predicting actual behavior. Pioneering work in behavioral decision theory
showed that decision makers use cognitive shortcuts, known as heuristics, that, while often accurate, can lead to predictable
deviations from normative decision making. For example, people use the ease of recall of instances to predict how likely such an
event is to occur. This is known as the availability heuristic, and is generally accurate, except in cases where recall and actual
frequency diverge (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Many people believe themselves more likely to be killed in an airplane crash
than in a car accident, yet the opposite is true.
Other work in behavioral decision theory has shown that people are overconﬁdent (Koriat et al., 1980), overly optimistic
(Weinstein, 1980), and fall prey to other biases such as the sunk cost bias (Staw, 1976), and the planning fallacy (Kahneman and
Lovallo, 1993). These biases have been explored on entrepreneurs (e.g., Koellinger et al., 2007) and to show that independent
1
We recognize that other researchers have used the term “screening” (e.g., Riding et al., 2007). We choose selection because it more accurately reﬂects the
process that we believe to be occurring.

<-----Page 2----->214

inventors fall prey to all of these biases (Åstebro et al., 2007). We therefore strongly believe that many heuristics and biases also
affect BA decision making and follow the lead of behavioral decision researchers in trying to determine how BAs actually decide.
We adhere to the recommendations of Bell et al. (1988) in offering prescriptions for entrepreneurs on how to modify their approaches
to improve their chances of receiving funding. We do this because we believe that it is far easier to coach entrepreneurs on the decision
processes of BAs than it would be to change BA decision making processes (which may actually be correct).
Previous theoretical BA research has focused on criteria identiﬁcation, evaluation and aggregation rather than the process by which
each criterion is evaluated. Hence, our theoretical contribution lies in the fact that we show that BAs do not use a fully compensatory
model in what we call the selection stage, where they weight and score all possible criteria. Rather, they use a short cut decision
heuristic where a smaller number of criteria are used and are only evaluated as to whether they are above a threshold value. Data
presented in this paper will conﬁrm that a complete analysis is not performed and potential investors in our sample use an
“elimination-by-aspects” heuristic to trim the evaluation set to a more manageable size for further analysis (Tversky, 1972).
We will outline this procedure and the reasons why we believe this is the decision heuristic followed as the paper unfolds. But
ﬁrst we present the extant research on the BA investment decision process, reviewing concerns or biases arising from the
approaches used in past studies. Then, prior to stating the two hypotheses that address our research question, we discuss
identiﬁcation of the selection stage in the investment decision process. We ﬁnally present our research method, analyses and
ﬁndings, and conclude by offering opportunities for future research, theoretical and methodological contributions, as well as
implications for practitioners.
3. Past business angel investment research and its limitation
Since Wetzel's (1981, 1983) original papers on BAs, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of BAs in
investing in new ventures. For example, Mason and Harrison (2000), Mason (2006) and Kelly (2007) identiﬁed the importance of
fund raising from third parties to facilitate the growth of new technology ventures. Beyond their importance in funding, there are
also a large number of them in North America. Riding (2008) identiﬁed that, in 2004, 15,800 BAs in Canada invested about
$2 billion in companies. A similar study by Sohl (2005) provided comparative information for the U.S., where BAs invested
$22.5 billion in 48,000 ventures in 2004. This makes understanding BA decision making very important.
Even though there are a large number of BAs active in North America, the ability of start-up ventures to attract funding has been
extremely limited (Riding et al., 1997). This is mostly attributed to the limited availability of high-quality ventures that can receive
investment or the lack of appropriate risk capital to invest in this class of opportunities. Mason and Harrison (2002) suggest that
low success rates can also be attributed to fundamental process inefﬁciencies, and go on to suggest that a greater understanding of
the investment decision process might increase investment success rates. In this paper, we look at the early stage of BA decision
making and the factors that cause an investment opportunity to be rejected.
Examining reasons for rejection rather than for success is a unique perspective in research on BA funding since past research has
predominantly looked at reasons for success. As a result, limited insight has been provided on the differences between successful and
unsuccessful investment decisions. Much of the reasons for focusing on success rather than failure are understandable as it is quite
challenging for a number of reasons. Ventures that fail to raise funding have a tendency to vanish, most investors are unwilling to
provide details on why they do not fund a business opportunity, and entrepreneurs are often not told the real reasons they do not
receive funding. To correct for these potential problems, Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest the use of real-time data gathering techniques
that involve recording the data and analyzing it while the interaction is in progress. In this paper, we use a data gathering approach that
overcomes these limitations and allows for the identiﬁcation of the selection stage and the decision heuristics used by BAs in this stage.
Past research has used a wide variety of possible criteria which BAs are posited to use when evaluating opportunities. As we
show in Table 1, researchers investigating funding criteria note the importance of ﬁnancial numbers and other easily veriﬁable
factors such as sales, evidence of marketplace acceptance and size, as well as patent protection (e.g., Mason and Stark, 2004).
Veriﬁable “human capital” factors are also important, including skills, experience, track record, and characteristics of
entrepreneurs and their management team (Haines et al., 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004). In addition to these relatively objective
factors, Feeney et al. (1999) identify more subjective personality characteristics including openness, honesty, realism and
integrity, and extend these ﬁndings in follow-on research to include strong work ethic, sound business understanding and realistic
notion of venture valuation (Haines et al., 2003). Clark (2008) further extends subjective personality characteristics to impression
management noting that certain opportunities can be ruled out because of presentational failings. However, all of the researchers
suggest that while reaching an overall level of evaluation may be necessary for receiving investment, this alone is unlikely to be
sufﬁcient.
The large number of criteria identiﬁed, and the correlation of some to success and others to failure, provides confusing evidence for
researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. It would seem that investors cannot possibly evaluate each opportunity against all these
criteria. Landström (1998) suggests that scholars consider the fact that the decision making criteria may vary as the investment
process unfolds over time. Riding et al. (2007) echo this suggestion and note that “there remains considerable room for research on the
nature of the investment process itself” and “how the various decision criteria are weighted at different points in the process” (p. 336).
We therefore isolate the “selection stage” in this paper in order to explore the decision making processes used and the factors
considered at this stage.
We also address and acknowledge limitation of prior research (also acknowledged in Wiltbank et al., 2009) that often relies on
BAs' recollections of their own decision process gathered at the end of (rather than during) the investment process. Past research
has shown that people have difﬁculty in accurately recounting their cognitive processes in retrospect (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977).

Other researchers have shown that this type of recall was also affected by a conﬁrmation bias, making retrospective recall of
decision processes unreliable (Mynatt et al., 1977). Therefore, relying on investors' recollections means that the collected data may
not reﬂect the actual decision process (Mason and Rogers, 1997; Mason and Stark, 2004). Thus, investors may provide decision
processes to researchers that make their decisions look better rather than trying to recollect the actual process used.
To correct for these potential problems, Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest the use of real-time data gathering techniques that involve
both recording the data and analyzing it while the interaction is in progress. Verbal protocol analysis (Ericsson and Simon, 1984) has
been the most commonly used real-time technique for investment decision, with Mason and Stark (2004) having used it on BAs.
Experiments can also be used, but external validity is reduced because experiments cannot create the three core characteristics of the
investment decision: the entrepreneur's ownership of the idea; real risk in the decision process; and the potential for the development
of a long-term relationship between the parties. We use a data gathering approach that overcomes these limitations and allows for the
identiﬁcation of investment stages and decision heuristics used in the BA investment process.
4. Stage identiﬁcation, decision heuristics, critical factors and hypotheses
Prior research has broken down the investment process into three main phases: the period of time prior to the interaction
between investor and entrepreneur; the interaction itself; and the period of time after a decision to invest has been made. We refer
to the phase prior to the direct interaction as origination, where trusted third parties refer a small number of fund-seeking
entrepreneurs to a speciﬁc investor (Paul et al., 2007). The phase after the decision to invest will be called formal due diligence,
where factual claims made by the entrepreneur are veriﬁed by the investor.2
It is between these two outer phases that an investor and entrepreneur must reach a deal, and this is the interaction captured in our
observational data. While there are multiple ways to break this phase down into intermediate stages, we choose to focus this paper on
what we call the selection stage, where we conﬁrm the majority of possible deals are rejected (Dal Cin et al., 1993). As suggested by
Adair and Brett (2005), changes in behavior can be used to identify the stage at which an interaction is taking place. At the selection
stage, we expect the information exchange during an interaction to be less subjective than after the selection set is reduced. Indeed,
statements made at the selection stage are “objective” in that any experienced BAs can make a similar determination, but statements
after that stage are more “subjective” since they are based on the BA's personal experience and ability to affect the venture post
investment. This view mirrors McMullen and Shepherd's (2006) observation of an initial opportunity evaluation being performed
from a third-person perspective (i.e., more objective) and being only evaluated from a ﬁrst-person perspective (i.e., more subjective) if
the initial assessment is positive. We therefore use the degree of subjectivity in information exchanges during an interaction, which
increases as the process unfolds, as an indicator of whether or not the interaction is in the selection stage or beyond it.
The process for measuring the relative subjectivity or objectivity of each interaction was determined based on the work of Kim
and Myaeng (2007) who used this approach to explore human–computer interactions in artiﬁcial intelligence systems. Using this
framework, each statement made could be classiﬁed as: objective, subjective or indeterminate. Statements such as “we have a
patent” or “our sales were $20,000 last month” were seen as objective, whereas “I believe there is a large market for this product”
or “everyone will want one” were seen to be subjective. Using a standard protocol analysis technique, each statement made by the
entrepreneur was analyzed and coded as objective, subjective or indeterminate. For each 2 min of the interaction, the ratio of
objective to subjective statements was measured. We graphed this ratio over time, and when this ratio fell below 85% the
opportunity was determined to have moved past the selection stage.
Regarding the decision heuristic, we believe a compensatory model (where higher levels of one attribute can compensate for
lower levels on another attribute) is not used at the selection stage due to the cost of a BA's time needed to gather data on all of the
attributes of all opportunities. So that they may devote a higher percentage of their time to investigate in detail the few
opportunities with high potential, we argue that they will adopt an elimination-by-aspects (EBA) decision heuristic that will let
them reject a large number of opportunities that are unlikely to receive funding (Tversky, 1972). Using this process, the investor will
initially look for one or more reasons to reject an opportunity, and trim the number of opportunities that require further attention.
While we acknowledge that this technique may not be the most accurate mechanism for decision making, it is one that recognizes
the real time constraints investors operate under, sacriﬁcing accuracy for speed in the decision making process (Payne et al., 1993).
The potential use of EBA as a decision making heuristic can only be veriﬁed if speciﬁc criteria can be identiﬁed that allow
investors to rapidly reject the majority of opportunities. Based on previous research on decision making factors considered by BAs,
shown in Table 1, and similar research on factors correlated to success or failure in new product development (Balachandra and
Friar, 1997; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987) we suggest eight factors that embrace this previous work. These eight factors have
also been used in an Innovators Assistance Program (Udell, 1989) and validated for predictive accuracy (Åstebro, 2004).
Each of these factors satisﬁes three criteria that make them suitable for use in an EBA decision making heuristic. They are:
diagnostic (its presence is positively correlated to success and its absence correlated to failure); objective (independent observer
ratings of the factor have high correlations); and can be observed relatively quickly. Each of the factors selected is shown in Table 2,
with a description of the criteria it encompasses and references to supporting work. Speciﬁc attention was paid to research that
identiﬁed how the presence of certain “fatal ﬂaws” were correlated to failure, as these factors would likely be useful when using
EBA. Factors related to the investment decision or the relationship between entrepreneur and investor were excluded due to their
subjectivity and their longer observation time.
2
While investors will undertake some informal due diligence during the “inner” evaluation process, they assume the entrepreneur's representations are true
and postpone the larger investment in due diligence until they know if a deal is likely.

We explain herein how each factor relates to the larger list of criteria shown in Table 1 and to relevant product development
research. The ﬁrst three factors are functions of the product. Ease of adoption is the attractiveness of the product to potential
customers in the target segment (Feeney et al., 1999). As Mason and Harrison (1996) note, its absence can be a deal killer. Product
status is a measure of both the technology and ﬁnancial risk in getting the product to market, and conﬁrms that a product is either in
the market or soon can be (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987). To ensure the long-term likelihood of
commercial success, a product or service must create a barrier to entry for potential competitors (e.g., through patents; Sudek, 2006).
Market factors are also important and comprise the next three of the eight critical factors. Customer engagement is seen as a
measurement of whether potential customers or users have been consulted in the product development, to ensure that the product
features and value proposition are aligned (Mason and Stark, 2004). In some cases, supply chain issues can be a critical factor, as in the
case of “route to market” for retail products (Mason and Harrison, 1996), which also captures the business model as well as market
dynamics. In highlighting what is often seen as the single most important criteria for BAs, the presence of an existing large market

(Feeney et al., 1999) or of a new market with high growth potential (Mason and Rogers, 1997) is viewed as critical. These two criteria
are captured in our “market potential” factor.
At the early stage, many researchers identify the critical importance of the entrepreneur (and sometimes the team) in making a
positive investment decision (Feeney et al., 1999; Sudek, 2006). However, precise attributes of the entrepreneur are often difﬁcult to
determine objectively or rank in importance. As such, the critical factor model has one broad category, namely relevant
entrepreneurial experience (Landström, 1998). Our ﬁnal factor encompasses a large variety of ﬁnancial concerns that have been
correctly pointed out by many past researchers (e.g., Feeney et al., 1999). While our ﬁnancial factor considers the proﬁtability of the
venture, it focuses more on how realistic are the anticipated cash ﬂows and projected growth of the venture (Mason and Stark, 2004).
That factor also augments the evaluation of the entrepreneur in the sense that accurate ﬁnancial projections signal knowledge of the
marketplace. Also, good cash management plans signal a strong and reliable entrepreneur.
In summary, we feel that our eight item critical-factor-assessment tool captures the criteria laid out by many past researchers.
At the same time, we feel that this is a more parsimonious way to evaluate early stage ventures. Finally, due to the value of BAs'
time, we feel that they will use a non-compensatory model to trim their possible investment set to a more manageable number.
This will allow them to spend more time thoroughly evaluating possible investments.
Hypothesis 1. Business angels use elimination-by-aspects (EBA) to trim the set of business opportunities looking for investment.
As mentioned earlier, EBA is a non-compensatory decision model that trades off speed of decision making for potential accuracy. In
decision analysis terms, it increases the chances of a false negative, rejecting an opportunity that might receive funding on the strength
of other criteria, but which does not pass the threshold value on a critical factor. Once the selection stage has been passed, however,
more accurate evaluations are required and so we believe that BAs switch to a more compensatory model of decision making (Payne
et al., 1993). In addition, since any fatal ﬂaw would have been discovered in the selection stage, these criteria can now be reduced in
importance or even eliminated completely. For these reasons, we believe that at subsequent stages the decision process will change as
will the criteria considered.
Hypothesis 2. Once the set of business opportunities looking for investment has been trimmed (i.e., after the selection stage),
business angels consider different factors and use different decision making processes.
5. Research method
Dragons' Den is a globally syndicated reality TV show currently being recorded and shown in ten countries. In the show,
entrepreneurs pitch their business opportunities to BAs (the Dragons) in the hopes of obtaining direct equity investment of between
$10,000 and $500,000. In the CBC show, entrepreneurs looking for money for their nascent ventures ﬁrst apply to participate through
an audition process at regional centers across Canada or through an online screening process. The screening process was designed by
the show's producers to match as closely as possible the screening process used by those who refer entrepreneurs to BAs (Dal Cin et al.,
1993).3 The screening resulted in 150 entrepreneurs who were invited to the studio over a period of 15 days. The interactions were
recorded in a continuous format and the results used for the production of the show footage (ten episodes of 44 min each). In analyzing
the interactions for this research we used unedited line tapes rather than the edited for television version.4 This gave us the
opportunity to examine and reexamine interactions.
In order to test our hypotheses, we had to delineate a selection stage. To do this, we used observational interaction, an enhanced
version of verbal protocol analysis pioneered by Gottman (1998). This technique is designed to record interactions between parties
and then allow trained independent raters to extract patterns for further analysis. Observational interaction involves ﬁrst videotaping
the interactions and then coding and analyzing them to interpret behaviors and information exchanges during these interactions.
During the interaction, the entrepreneur started by stating his or her name, the nature of the proposed business and the amount of
capital required. The Dragons then quizzed the entrepreneur on his or her experience and the details of the business in order to decide
whether or not to make an investment offer. The interaction continued until either all ﬁve Dragons withdrew, or one or more Dragons
proposed an investment of their own funds that could then be accepted or rejected by the entrepreneur. When each Dragon withdrew
from an opportunity, he or she was required to provide a reason for the lack of interest in moving forward. Sixteen opportunities
moved past the selection stage, however only nine received funding.
5.1. Validity concerns
The use of a reality TV show for academic research raises speciﬁc questions regarding whether an artiﬁcial environment (e.g.,
TV) changes behaviors (Hight, 2001). A number of researchers have used the natural experiments of game shows to investigate
people's attitude to risk aversion, expected utility theory, endowment, heterogeneity and discrimination. For example, Gertner
(1993) used the game-show “Card Sharks”, Metrick (1995) looked at “Jeopardy”, Hartley et al. (2005) examined interactions from

One of the authors was directly involved in the establishment of the initial screening process in Toronto and in Waterloo. This process was then replicated
across the country by CBC staff.

Line tapes are single continuous recording of the live interactions that include several camera angles. These recordings are time and date stamped and
contain no gaps in the dialogue. On several occasions, these tapes also provided a record of follow up discussions between Dragons after the entrepreneur had
exited.

“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”, Levitt (2004) studied “Weakest Link” and de Roos and Saraﬁdis (2006) examined behaviors on
“Deal or No Deal”. These studies have conﬁrmed the general applicability of television shows to “real-world” decision making. All
of these are deemed reliable as they study people under situations of real consequences, as does the show “Dragons' Den”, since
investors offer their own funds to real opportunities. Furthermore, behavioral economic studies have found that participant's TV
behavior in an intense decision-making environment reﬂected similar behaviors in real-life. Post et al. (2008), for example,
investigated prospect theory using “Deal or No Deal”. They conﬁrmed that contestants' decisions on the show were similar to those
in a subsequent experiment that replicated the risky decision making processes. They also noted “prior to the show, contestants
have had considerable time to think about what they might do in various situations” (p. 67). This was the case in Dragons' Den
where both BAs and entrepreneurs had time to reﬂect on how they would make a decision prior to actually making it.
5.2. Coding and analysis
For each investment opportunity, three trained raters calculated a grade for the opportunity on each of the eight critical factors.
These raters completed the review before knowing the outcome of the opportunity. One of these raters is one of the authors of this
paper while the two other raters have had extensive experience of the critical-factor-assessment tool and were both highly trained
and experienced in issues around the viability of new business. A factor was given an A if there was a clear advantage associated
with the factor, C if there was a clear problem, which corresponded to a fatal ﬂaw, and B if the answer was in between. The scoring
guidelines for the speciﬁc ratings for each factor are given in Table 3. Raters could annotate each individual score with a + or − to
facilitate discrimination between opportunities. For analytical purposes, we translated the grades to a numerical score and created
a “gap” between each grade category, speciﬁcally A+ = 10, A = 9, A− = 8, B+ = 6, B = 5, B− = 4, C+ = 2, C = 1, C− = 0. The gap
was created to highlight the importance of a change in category (particularly the “fatal ﬂaw” grade). Inter-rater reliability was
found to be 72% on the full scale, but when absolute scores (i.e., A+, B−, etc.) were replaced with categorical scores (A, B, C), the
inter-rater reliability improved to 95%.5 This shows broad agreement regarding the presence or absence of a fatal ﬂaw. In fact, the
agreement between raters on the presence of a fatal ﬂaw was 97%. For each factor, the scores from the three raters were added and
divided by three, then rounded off to the nearest integer. Adding the scores for the eight factors provided the actual critical-factorassessment score for the opportunity.
6. Results
Our ﬁrst step was to isolate the types of interactions that occurred in the selection stage in order to determine whether an
opportunity had moved beyond this stage. To do this, as previously explained, we used verbal protocol analysis on interactions from
the previous season of the show (season 1) to measure the level of objectivity displayed over the course of the interactions; using this
level of objectivity to establish whether or not the interaction was in the selection stage or past it. By objectivity, we mean questions
and responses that most parties would interpret in a similar manner. For instance, questions such as “do you have a patent” and “how
many orders do you have lined up” would be coded as completely objective. Each question-and-answer interaction was coded as
completely objective, completely subjective, or 50% of each. Based upon the authors' experience with season 1, we chose 85% or more
objective as indicative of being in the selection stage. This analysis was then applied to season 2 data to categorize the selection stage
from the later stages.
To test whether EBA was being used in the selection stage, we created a 2 × 2 matrix with the presence of a fatal ﬂaw (i.e., a “C”)
on one axis and whether or not the opportunity moved beyond the selection stage (was selected) on the other. As per Table 4,
every opportunity that had a fatal ﬂaw was rejected by all of the Dragons during the selection stage. We also found that all of the
opportunities without a fatal ﬂaw completed the selection stage — that is at least one of the Dragons was interested in pursuing the
opportunity further. This ﬁnding conﬁrmed Hypothesis 1, that the presence of a fatal ﬂaw would stop an investment from
proceeding, while the absence of a fatal ﬂaw would allow an opportunity to complete the selection stage.
Recall also that the Dragons were asked for their reason for rejection. There were 750 interactions (5 Dragons and 150
opportunities) of which 80 (5 × 16) had no fatal ﬂaw, as identiﬁed by both sides (Dragons and raters). As shown in Table 5, in 89%

of the rejections 5999
670 × 100% the reason given was a fatal ﬂaw on one or more of the eight critical factors. Other reasons used by
the BAs to reject included “I am uncomfortable with the opportunity” (e.g., weapons accessories) or “I feel that the entrepreneur's
funding request is unreasonable” (unrealistic valuation). On numerous occasions, a second or third BA identiﬁed the same fatal
ﬂaw. Also, an opportunity was often rejected prior to the BA's evaluation on all critical factors because the interaction was
terminated before that BA had the chance to review all factors. We feel this provides further support for the use of EBA and for the
rigor of our eight critical factors.
To further conﬁrm that EBA was used rather than a weighted score on all attributes, we performed a logistic regression, coding
a move to the post-selection stage as one, and a rejection in the selection stage as a zero.6 We then used that regression model to
predict whether or not the opportunity would continue to the post-selection stage. As per Table 6, while this model performed
well in predicting whether an opportunity continued (B = 0.658, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke r-square = 0.92), this model was less
accurate than a simple discrete model. The positive performance of the model is largely driven by the correct prediction on 99.3%
of rejected opportunities. It is less accurate on predicting successes, incorrectly rejecting 2 of the 16 opportunities that moved

For completeness, we analyzed the data with and without the +/− and found no appreciable differences in the results.
The independent variable was the critical-factor-assessment score for the opportunity.

beyond the selection stage. Since an EBA model is more accurate on predicting successful selection and more parsimonious, we
conclude that this is the model followed by BAs.
We also proposed that the decision making process changed once the selection stage had been passed (e.g., to the funding
decision). To test this, we performed a t-test on the scores of the 16 opportunities that passed the selection stage using whether
or not an opportunity received funding as the grouping variable. The mean score for those opportunities funded was 54.56, not
statistically different from the mean score of 54.29 for unfunded opportunities (t(14) = 0.06, p = 0.96). A Levene's test for
equality of variances was not statistically signiﬁcant, so we assume that the samples do not have different variances. We argue
that this shows that the decision criteria and the decision making process are different post-selection, thus conﬁrming
Hypothesis 2.
7. Discussion and conclusion
Past research on BA decision making assumes that potential investors use a large laundry list of factors that are then combined
in some weighting model. Our results, however, contradict this view by showing that elimination-by-aspects (Tversky, 1972), a
non-compensatory decision making heuristic, better deﬁnes the BAs in their initial decision making process. This is our main
theoretical contribution; that we demonstrate a shortcoming of previous theoretical research, which only focused on the criteria
evaluated, rather than the process by which it was evaluated. We have utilized a more parsimonious set of criteria (the eight
critical factors) and also shown that the BAs do not use a fully compensatory model, although most previous research suggests that
they should. While non-compensatory decision making heuristics may reject a good candidate simply for a low score on one
attribute, it has the beneﬁt of being a fast decision making tool, saving valuable time. Once a potential investor discovers a “fatal
ﬂaw,” he or she no longer needs to consider that opportunity and can curtail the interaction.
Our results also show that EBA as a decision making heuristic is not used in the ﬁnal decision of whether or not to fund an
opportunity. Subsequent to the selection process, these factors are much less important, with other criteria, likely more subjective,
being used to make the ﬁnal decision. While we have not yet analyzed data in the post-selection stage, we believe that more
compensatory models of decision making are used at subsequent stages.

7.1. Limitations and future research
The main limitation is the use of a reality TV show as a research venue rather than actual BA behavior in their normal
businesses. However, as discussed earlier in the paper, experts were hired by the show producers to mimic as much as possible the
real processes in which BAs engage. We believe this procedure mitigates this concern. Some might also criticize the television
show setting by saying that it imposes artiﬁcial time constraints on the BAs. If this were true, then they would be somehow forced
into using the EBA heuristic in order to save time. While the show may have forced the Dragons to economize on their time, we
have every reason to believe that the Dragons perceive their time as valuable. In fact, Mason and Rogers (1997) observe time
compression in actual investment decisions, ﬁnding the median time BAs devoted to the equivalent of our “selection stage” was
just 9 min. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in the normal course of business (beyond the show) BAs would attempt to
adopt any decision heuristics that would save them time at a minimal cost in accuracy (e.g., EBA).
Some may further argue that the rejection decisions of the BAs were inﬂuenced by the others. In other words, if one dropped
out, the others may feel some peer pressure to do the same. Indeed, Banerjee (1992) and Scharfsetin and Stein (1990) would argue
that BAs' individual decisions could not be relied on as independent, as they would be inﬂuenced by the decisions of other BAs.
These authors argue that this is a rational approach to decision making, because there is an assumption that another BA's decision
carries relevant information that is pertinent to the decision being made. This would lead us to assume that once one BA drops out
of an investment opportunity, the rest would follow. Similarly, it would lead us to suggest that once a single BA made an offer to
invest, the others would also invest. While we cannot rule out this possibility, we believe that personality factors of the Dragons
would greatly reduce the likelihood of any herding behavior. In fact, the producers of the show selected Dragons who were
deemed highly egotistical. This personality trait would make them want to stand out from others, thereby diminishing any motive

<-----Page 10----->222

A.L. Maxwell et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 26 (2011) 212–225

to follow the crowd. In addition, the Dragons were not compensated for appearing on the show, meaning that their behaviors led
to actual ﬁnancial consequences. Thus we believe they acted in a manner consistent with how they would act outside the show.
Another possible limitation is that this paper focused only on the selection stage rather than the full interaction leading to the
funding decision. Using observational interactions to extend it to the post-selection stage would enable the identiﬁcation of
decision criteria and what other decision heuristics might be used by BAs over the entire investment decision process. An analysis
of the entrepreneur–BA interactions throughout that process would help identify how the ongoing relationship develops and its
implications for receiving funding and longer-term development of entrepreneur–investor relationships.
In addition, the sample is admittedly small, with only ﬁve BAs evaluating 150 possible investment opportunities.7 There were
over 250,000 BAs operating in the U.S. in 2008 (Sohl, 2009), so while we can begin to make some observations about the processes
followed by our sample, generalizing their behavior to the full population would be risky. We also cannot be certain that the
opportunities chosen by the producers are representative of all possible opportunities that a BA would see in a year. However, even
with these possible limitations, we believe this work makes a contribution toward understanding BA behaviors when making
investment decisions. Future work should try to test our hypotheses on a larger scale and in a variety of contexts.
The critical factors we chose may also have some limitations. There may be missing factors which were not considered or
redundant factors that are unnecessary. Even though our model of eight critical factors performed well in predicting which investment
opportunity moved out of the selection stage, other research suggests that there may be additional factors that would help predict
success, particularly beyond the selection stage. Our observations are consistent with this past research. When the entrepreneur
provided an unrealistic valuation, the interaction was often terminated, although this was usually after other information had already
been gathered. In addition, we found that the BA had to like the industry, reducing the chance they would invest in products with
which they could not identify. We also found that if the entrepreneur was inconsistent when presenting information or the BA knew
that information presented by the entrepreneur was incorrect, the interaction ended.
We also investigated the role of relevant experience of the BA (domain expertise) in increasing the likelihood of an investment
(e.g., McMullen and Shepherd, 2006). We found mixed support for this in the sense that while domain expertise increased a BA's
likelihood to invest, it also caused the BA to be more critical when evaluating an opportunity. Creating factors for each of these possible
factors as noted above might increase the predictive power of an opportunity being selected, however, since the eight factor model did
the job well, adding these may simply increase complexity for no additional accuracy.
Admittedly, some of the eight factors might be redundant, and a model with fewer factors would be just as successful in predicting
selection. This is suggested by a number of follow up analyses on the data. First, the individual scores on each factor are highly correlated as
portrayed in Table 7. Redundancy is also suggested by the fact that there is usually more than one fatal ﬂaw in an opportunity as
highlighted in Table 5 and in Table 8, which shows, by opportunity, whether or not it was selected to move beyond the ﬁrst stage and how
many fatal ﬂaws that opportunity had. Finally, tests of independence not reported here show that almost none of the factors are
completely independent of the others.8 These analyses all suggest that a smaller set of critical factors may be sufﬁcient in predicting
success in the selection stage. However, since our sample is small (n=150), these tests of independence do not have as much power as
they would have in a larger sample. We therefore feel it is too early to claim that fewer than the full eight factors would be sufﬁcient.
7.2. Other contributions
An important contribution of this paper to the existing literature has been methodological. We rely on an observational interaction
technique that enabled us to reduce possible biases by observing behaviors rather than relying on BAs' recollections. This approach also
allowed us to isolate the selection stage and observe the interactions before the investment decision was known. Further, the videobased collection allowed for the gathering of both qualitative and quantitative data. In addition to conﬁrming our hypotheses, this data
helped identify behaviors that positively or negatively affected the likelihood of completing the selection stage.
A second methodological contribution has been our focus on reasons for rejection rather than reasons for choosing. Most past
research has focused on reasons for success. Analyzing only successes limits insights on the factors that can differentiate between
receiving funding or not. As a result, the development of a “diagnostic tool” that can identify the factors correlated to success is made
easier by studying the reasons for rejection. Because most data gathering effort have been conducted at the end of the investment
decision process, isolating the early stages of the investment has also been difﬁcult. Analyzing the causes for rejection at the selection
stage can help scholars understand how the information exchange that develops during the BA–entrepreneur interaction impacts the
likelihood of moving further in the investment decision process.
Our research also has several practical implications. Entrepreneurs aware of each of the eight most common causes for rejection at
the selection stage (i.e., a C score for adoption, product status, protectability, customer engagement, route to market, market potential,
relevant experience, or ﬁnancial model) can ﬁnd ways to eliminate or reduce them prior to pitching their ideas to a potential investor.
7
We do not assume that the Dragons are representative of all BAs. Nevertheless, Dal Cin et al. (1993) and Madill et al. (2005) identify some key BA
characteristics and experiences that led us to conclude that there are similarities in the approach made to investment decisions when BAs are serial investors
with entrepreneurial experience. Our ﬁve BAs were all serial investors and had a strong entrepreneurial background in the food (Boston Pizza), marketing
(Venture Communications), retail (LaSenza), Internet security (Brak Systems) and education (Learning Company) sectors. They also exhibited many of the
classic BAs characteristics noted in previous research (Dal Cin et al., 1993; Landström, 2007), including broad investment experience, come from different
backgrounds and parts of the country, and have made previous seed investments. Hence, they may not be perfectly representative but are a good sample for a
case study.
8
Independence of factors would be shown by the likelihood of occurrence of one fatal ﬂaw not be affected by the presence of another ﬂaw. For all factors
except factor 3 (protectability), the hypothesis of independence of factors is rejected.

Also, as entrepreneurs are made aware of the importance of these factors, they will likely present more relevant information to
potential investors and reduce the potential for rejection due to miscommunication. We conﬁrmed this belief by offering
entrepreneurs participating in season 3 of the show a series of webinars that focused on identifying and addressing the eight critical
factors. These sessions led to a near doubling of opportunities passing the selection stage. The number of opportunities funded doubled
and the total dollar amount of funding more than tripled. To conﬁrm that it was the webinars that led to this increase, we held
interviews with successful entrepreneurs. Over 90% felt that these webinars were helpful in structuring their presentations and
understanding the dynamics of the interactions.
Regarding academic contributions, Riding et al. (2007) noted the need for more research on how BAs arrive at their investment
decisions. To move a step further in this direction, we studied the investment decision process of BAs to identify how they trim the set
of potential business opportunities and, once this set is trimmed, whether a different set of criteria is used to move an opportunity to
the next stage. We did this while addressing the limits of prior research with a set of interactions from the Canadian version of a reality
TV show. We found support for our two hypotheses. That is, BAs looked for the presence of a single fatal ﬂaw in one of eight critical
factors as a reason for rejection at the selection stage, but BAs dropped this non-compensatory decision heuristic and considered
different factors as they made ﬁnal funding decisions. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant academic, practitioner, and policy maker
implications as we have outlined. In addition, we hope that our exploration of the initial stage (selection) of the BA investment process
will spur future research in further enhancing the understanding of the interaction between entrepreneurs and investors.
