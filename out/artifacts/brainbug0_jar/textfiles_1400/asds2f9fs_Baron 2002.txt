efforts have proven quite fruitful,
and suggest that many factors investigated by psychologists do indeed
play a role in entrepreneurs’ success.
In this article, I review findings
pointing to this conclusion.

Abstract
Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful
than others in starting new
companies—ones that create
wealth for their societies as
well as themselves? Growing
evidence suggests that the answer involves the influence of
both cognitive and social factors. Successful entrepreneurs
appear to think differently
than other persons in several
respects (e.g., they are less
likely to engage in counterfactual thinking but more likely to
show overconfidence in their
judgments). Similarly, successful entrepreneurs appear to be
higher in social competence—the
ability to interact effectively
with others (e.g., they are better at social perception and
adapting to new social situations). These results suggest
that the principles and findings
of psychology can be invaluable to researchers in the field
of entrepreneurship, providing
important insights into the factors that influence entrepreneurs’ success.

During the 1980s and 1990s, major U.S. corporations “downsized”
almost 5 million jobs out of existence. Yet, in this same period, unemployment in the United States

fell to its lowest level in three decades, and Americans came to enjoy unprecedented prosperity.
How did this seemingly paradoxical set of circumstances emerge?
Many experts believe that the explanation lies in the activities of entrepreneurs—individuals who
identify opportunities and start
new companies to develop them
(Shane & Venkataraman, in press).
The new ventures started by entrepreneurs more than made up for
the loss of jobs in large, existing
companies, and—many people
would contend—played a key role
in strengthening the U.S. economy.
Given the important role of entrepreneurs in creating jobs for millions of persons, it is not surprising
that a new field of entrepreneurship has emerged during the past
two decades. It is interdisciplinary
in nature, with roots in economics,
sociology, and management. However, until recently, it has not
drawn extensively upon the findings of modern psychology. This is
somewhat puzzling because two of
the central questions it addresses—
“Why do some persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs?” and “Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful
than others?”—focus, at least in part,
on the behavior and characteristics
of entrepreneurs. For the past several years, I have sought to establish
closer links between psychology and
the field of entrepreneurship. In
particular, several researchers, including myself, have applied the
findings of cognitive and social psy-

COGNITIVE FACTORS IN
ENTREPRENEURSHIP:
COUNTERFACTUAL
THINKING,
OVERCONFIDENCE, AND
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COGNITIVE BIASES
Do entrepreneurs think differently than other persons do? And
do successful entrepreneurs differ
from less successful ones in such
respects? Careful examination of
the environments in which entrepreneurs operate suggests that the
answer to both questions may well
be “yes.” Entrepreneurs often work
in situations that are, by definition,
new, unpredictable, complex, and
subject to high time pressures. Moreover, entrepreneurs’ commitment to
their new ventures is often intense,
so they may also experience powerful emotions in connection with their
activities. Together, such factors may
produce severe information overload, and it is precisely under such
conditions that individuals often
rely on heuristics to guide their
thinking and decision making, and
show enhanced susceptibility to
various forms of cognitive bias or error. A general prediction, then, is
that entrepreneurs may be more
likely than other people to employ
heuristics and to fall prey to various
forms of cognitive error (e.g., overconfidence, escalation of commitment) (Baron, 1998).
Evidence consistent with this
prediction has been reported in
several recent studies (e.g., Baron,
1998). For instance, Busenitz and
Barney (1997) found that entrepreneurs were significantly more
likely to show overconfidence in

<-----Page 1----->16
their own judgments and significantly more likely to make use of
the representativeness heuristic
(enhanced willingness to generalize from small, nonrandom
samples) than were other persons.
Similarly, Palich and Bagby (1995)
found that entrepreneurs tended to
perceive greater potential for gain
in highly uncertain situations than
nonentrepreneurs did; in essence,
their perceptions of risk showed
greater bias than those of other persons. Together, these and other findings suggest that entrepreneurs may
indeed show heightened susceptibility to various cognitive errors.
Entrepreneurs do not always
show this tendency, however. For
instance, recent findings indicate
that they are less likely than other
persons to engage in counterfactual
thinking—imagining outcomes or
events different from those that actually occurred (e.g., Roese, 1997).
Although counterfactual thinking
is not in itself a cognitive error, engaging in such thinking can sometimes interfere with taking action,
and often generates strong feelings
of regret, so it can interfere with
performance in many situations. In
one study on this topic (Baron,
2000), I asked three groups of persons—entrepreneurs (individuals
who had started their own business), potential entrepreneurs (individuals who wanted to start a
business), and nonentrepreneurs
(persons who had no interest in
starting a business)—to rate their
own tendencies to engage in counterfactual thinking about missed
opportunities. On the basis of previous research suggesting that entrepreneurs are future-oriented
and show tendencies toward both
overconfidence and unfounded optimism (e.g., Busenitz & Barney,
1997), I predicted that they would
be less likely to engage in counterfactual thinking than the other
groups. The results offered clear
support for this hypothesis.
Is a reduced tendency to engage

VOLUME 9, NUMBER 1, FEBRUARY 2000

in counterfactual thinking a “plus”
for entrepreneurs? This is far from
certain. As noted by Roese (1997),
engaging in such thought is something of a two-edged sword: On
the one hand, it often generates
negative affect (especially when individuals imagine better outcomes
than they experienced). On the
other hand, counterfactual thinking may also help individuals understand why negative outcomes
occurred, and so assist them in devising better future strategies. It
may be, then, that a reduced tendency to engage in counterfactual
thinking encourages entrepreneurs
to engage in the high-risk activity
of founding new businesses, but it
may prevent them from profiting
maximally from their mistakes.
This line of reasoning suggests that
successful entrepreneurs may be
no more likely than less successful
ones to engage in counterfactual
thinking. When they do, however,
they may focus more intently on
identifying the specific causes of
negative outcomes, and so may
reap greater benefits from counterfactual thought. Research designed
to assess this possibility is currently under way.
In sum, a growing number of
studies suggest that applying the
findings of cognitive psychology
and social cognition to entrepreneurship may shed new light on
the questions of why some individuals but not others choose to become entrepreneurs, and why
some are so much more successful
than others in this activity.

THE ROLE OF SOCIAL
COMPETENCE IN
ENTREPRENEURS’
SUCCESS: WHY THE
ABILITY TO GET ALONG
WITH OTHERS
REALLY MATTERS
Samuel Butler once remarked
(1951, p. 112): “We are not won by

arguments that we can analyze, but
by tone and temper, by the manner
which is the person himself.”
What he was suggesting, I believe,
is that personal style—including
the ability to interact effectively
with others—is one important determinant of success in many
spheres of life. And indeed, a large
body of empirical evidence offers
support for this proposal. This research suggests that individuals’
overall capacity to interact effectively with others (what has sometimes been termed social competence)
exerts strong beneficial effects in
many contexts. For example, various social skills contribute to positive outcomes not only in romance
and personal adjustment, but also
in job interviews, yearly performance reviews, negotiations, and
even court proceedings, to cite only
a few results (e.g., McKelvie & Coley, 1993; Robbins & DeNisi, 1994).
In all these contexts, people possessing well-developed social skills
experience more favorable outcomes than people lacking in such
skills. (Social competence is used
here merely as a summary term for
the combined influence of various
social skills; cf. Spence, Donovan,
& Brechman-Toussaint, 1999).
Does social competence also
play a role in entrepreneurs’ success? This might be the case for
several reasons. Most new ventures
are founded not by single entrepreneurs but by two or more entrepreneurs. Clearly, the ability to get
along effectively with one’s partners could contribute to enhanced
success in such cases. Similarly, entrepreneurs must deal with many
persons outside their new ventures—bankers, potential customers, prospective employees. Being
able to interact effectively with
such persons might increase the
chances of gaining favorable outcomes in all these face-to-face contexts (e.g., actually obtaining financial backing or signing up new
customers).

<-----Page 2----->CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE

On the basis of such reasoning,
Gideon Markman and I (Baron &
Markman, 1999a) predicted that
the higher entrepreneurs’ social
competence, the greater their financial success. To test this hypothesis,
we designed an instrument to measure several social skills found, in
previous research, to exert strong
and consistent effects in business
contexts. We then administered
this questionnaire to several hundred entrepreneurs working in two
different industries (cosmetics,
high-tech). Statistical analyses (e.g.,
confirmatory factor analysis) indicated that a four-factor structure fit
the data best, and these factors
were readily identifiable as reflecting (a) social perception—accuracy
in perceiving others, (b) impression
management—techniques for inducing positive reactions in others, (c)
persuasiveness—the ability to
change others’ views or behavior in
desired directions, and (d) social
adaptability—the ability to adapt to,
or feel comfortable in, a wide range
of social situations. These aspects
of social competence were then
used to predict financial success for
both groups of entrepreneurs
(measured by their income from
their businesses). Results indicated
that social perception was a significant predictor of financial success
for both samples (R2 = .36 and .45,
respectively), and social adaptability was a significant predictor for
the first sample (R 2 = .43). Together, these findings suggest that
aspects of entrepreneurs’ social
competence do indeed influence
their financial success.
In a related study, we (Baron &
Markman, 1999b) obtained standardized photographs of another
sample of entrepreneurs (71 females who had started their own
cosmetic businesses). The physical
attractiveness of these persons was
rated by 54 judges who were unacquainted with them. Results indicated that the higher the ratings of
attractiveness, the more the entre-

preneurs earned from their businesses; indeed, the entrepreneurs
rated as most attractive (highest
20%) earned fully $53,815 more per
year than those rated as least attractive (lowest 20%).
In our latest work, Candida
Brush and I have obtained videotapes of entrepreneurs presenting
their ideas to staff of a consulting
company that helps entrepreneurs
obtain financial backing. These
tapes were then shown to graduate
students in psychology and business, who rated the entrepreneurs
on several dimensions (e.g., attractiveness, career success, energy
and motivation, social skills, persuasiveness). This research is longitudinal; we will obtain information on the entrepreneurs’ actual
success over the next several years
in order to determine if ratings on
these dimensions significantly predict financial success.

REFLECTIONS ON THE
BENEFITS OF EXPORTING
PSYCHOLOGY—AND ON
THE ANTIPERSONALITY
BIAS IN
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Many economists believe that
entrepreneurs play a vital role in
the economies of the United States
and other countries. Without entrepreneurs, they suggest, we would
now be experiencing a painful recession rather than an economic
boom. Moreover, the new products
and services devised by entrepreneurs are often beneficial to many
persons.
Given the economic and social
importance of entrepreneurs, it
seems important to assist them in
their efforts to create new products
and companies. That such assistance is necessary is suggested by
the fact that most new ventures fail
within a few years. Moreover, in
many cases, entrepreneurs fail

even though their technical skills,
experience, and motivation are
high, and their ideas are sound and
useful. Why, given all these
strengths, do they founder? Research findings suggest that these
failures may stem, at least in part,
from cognitive and social factors:
Entrepreneurs may fall victim to
costly cognitive errors, and may be
lacking in social skills that could
well smooth their paths to success.
And this, I believe, is where psychology can make a unique contribution. Psychologists not only can
help to identify the cognitive and
social factors that influence entrepreneurs’ success; they can also devise techniques for helping entrepreneurs cope with problems
relating to these factors. Effective
procedures for enhancing various
social skills have already been developed by psychologists. Providing entrepreneurs with such training might well assist them in their
efforts to start new ventures.
This is not the only way in
which psychology can be invaluable to the field of entrepreneurship, however. Since initiating research in this field, I have been
puzzled by the fact that terms such
as personality and individual differences are virtually anathema to
entrepreneurship researchers. Why
has a field that focuses on persons
who must, in some ways, be
unique turned its back so firmly on
individual differences? The primary reason, I believe, is this: More
than two decades ago, efforts were
initiated to identify the “key traits”
of entrepreneurs. Given the lack of
well-developed theory at the time,
such research largely failed (cf.
Shaver & Scott, 1991). This failure,
in turn, left a strong antipersonality
bias in the field. Given major advances in the understanding of personality, this perspective is no
longer justified. It seems feasible,
for instance, that entrepreneurs
may differ from other persons with
respect to some of the “Big Five”

<-----Page 3----->18
dimensions of personality (basic
aspects of personality). Among
these, openness to experience and
emotional stability are two likely
candidates. Similarly, entrepreneurs may differ from other persons with respect to sensation seeking (entrepreneurs may be more
prone to sensation seeking) and
need for cognition (entrepreneurs
may have less need for cognition,
as they often prefer action to systematic thought). A substantial
body of evidence indicates that
such factors influence success in
many business contexts, so why
not apply them to entrepreneurs as
well? In short, it is time for the field
of entrepreneurship to brush off its
antipersonality bias and to draw on
advances in this area of psychology, too. Doing so may provide additional insights concerning entrepreneurs—and why they succeed
or fail.
In sum, from both a scientific
and a practical perspective, applying the principles and findings of
psychology to the study of entrepreneurs seems to hold great
promise. I have already made a
personal commitment to “exporting” our field in this manner, and

VOLUME 9, NUMBER 1, FEBRUARY 2000

hope that I will soon be joined in
this effort by a growing number of
colleagues. In this context, the
words of the poet Kahlil Gibran
(1958, p. 63) ring true: “A little
knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge
that is idle.”
