Entrepreneurial
Orientation, Learning
Orientation, and
Firm Performance
Catherine L. Wang

Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a key ingredient for firm success. Nonetheless, an important message from past findings is that simply examining the direct effect of EO on firm
performance provides an incomplete picture. Prior studies examined various internal and
external factors that influence the EO–performance relationship. However, learning orientation (LO) has been a missing link in the examination of the relationship. Using data from 213
medium-to-large UK firms, this study finds that LO mediates the EO-performance relationship, and the EO–LO–performance link is stronger for prospectors than analyzers. The
findings indicate that LO must be in place to maximize the effect of EO on performance, and
that LO is an important dimension, along with EO, to distinguish prospectors from analyzers.

Introduction
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) refers to “the processes, practices, and decisionmaking activities that lead to new entry” (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 136). EO is revealed
through firm-level characteristics as summarized by Miller (1983, p. 771): “An entrepreneurial firm is one that engages in product-market innovation, undertakes somewhat risky
ventures, and is first to come up with ‘proactive’ innovations, beating competitors to the
punch.” Such characteristics are associated with improved firm performance in today’s
business environments where product and business model life cycles are shortened
(Hamel, 2000), and where the future profit streams from existing operations are uncertain
and businesses need to constantly seek out new opportunities (Wiklund & Shepherd,
2005). Several studies have found that firms demonstrating more entrepreneurial strategic
orientation perform better (Wiklund, 1999; Zahra, 1991; Zahra & Covin, 1995). However,
Smart and Conant (1994) did not find a significant EO–performance relationship, and Hart
(1992) argued that a firm’s entrepreneurial strategy-making mode may even lead to poor
performance under certain circumstances.
An important message from past findings is that simply examining the direct
EO–performance relationship provides an incomplete picture of performance (Lumpkin
& Dess, 1996; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005). This urges future research to control internal
and external contingent factors in the examination of the EO–performance relationship

& Ritter, 2005; Wiklund, 1999; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003, 2005) Neglecting these
contingent factors will lead to the “wholesale adoption” of an entrepreneurial strategic
orientation (Wiklund, 1999), and forsake firms’ entrepreneurial efforts. Recent studies
have found that the effect of EO on performance is influenced by firm size, national
culture (Rauch et al., 2004), access to financial resources (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005),
network capability (Walter et al., 2005), and strategic processes (Covin et al., 2006).
Nevertheless, thus far, a firm’s learning orientation (LO) has been a missing link in the
examination of the EO–performance relationship.
Sinkula, Baker, and Noordewier (1997) conceptualize LO as a firm’s values (i.e.,
commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision) that influence its propensity to create and use knowledge. Such values guide a firm’s behavior and processes
of acquiring diverse information, developing common understanding of information
acquired, and generating new knowledge or organizational insights (Fiol & Lyles, 1985).
A learning organization bears an explicit focus on the acquisition of knowledge that is
potentially useful for the organization (Harrison & Leitch, 2005) in order to refine existing
knowledge and routines (i.e., adaptive learning) or to question long-held assumptions and
develop a new way of thinking (i.e., generative learning) (Slater & Narver, 1995). Learning orientation underpins firms’ internal self-renewal, and is an important aspect of firms’
strategizing activities (Covin et al., 2006). Covin et al. (2006) reckon that the strategizing
activities that organizational learning entails—how firms choose, learn from, and refine or
redefine their major business-related decisions and the patterns they assume—are critical
to maximize the effect of the EO on firm performance.
This study builds on the existing body of work and, more specifically, conceptualizes
LO as a mediator of the EO–performance relationship. Entrepreneurial firms constantly
face complex and turbulent external environments (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996) that are fertile
for new information and knowledge, and hence provide a context that is conducive to
information acquisition and dissemination. The more entrepreneurial a firm is, the more
proactively and extensively it engages in environmental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984;
Miles & Snow, 1978), and the greater extent to which it is involved in information
acquisition and dissemination (Huber, 1991; Sinkula, 1994). Furthermore, entrepreneurial
firms are innovative and risk-tolerant, and therefore provide the internal environment in
which learning through exploration and experimentation is most likely to take place
(Hamel & Prahalad, 1991; Slater & Narver, 1995). However, to reap the benefits of
entrepreneurial efforts, a firm must be committed to learning, open-minded to new
information and new ways of doing things, and most importantly, engage in shared
interpretation of information where a consensus on the meaning of the information is
achieved (Sinkula, 1994; Slater & Narver, 1995). Hence, it is through LO that a firm
maximizes the impact of EO on firm performance.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the EO–LO–performance relationship,
drawing on data collected from 213 medium-to-large UK firms. This study seeks to
contribute to the EO–performance literature by incorporating LO as a mediator and firm
strategy as a moderator. More specifically, the first research question lies in: Is the
EO–performance relationship mediated by LO in medium-to-large firms? By addressing
this question, this study aims to cross-fertilize entrepreneurship and organizational
learning literature—an under-researched area in which Deakins (1999, p. 23) called for
further studies: “our limited knowledge and understanding of the interaction of learning
and the entrepreneurial process remains one of the most neglected areas of entrepreneurial
research, and thus, understanding.” Harrison and Leitch (2005) most recently renew the
call for cross-fertilization of the entrepreneurship and organizational learning literature in
636

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->the 2005 special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice. Furthermore, this study
tests whether the links of the EO–LO–performance vary in strength across Miles and
Snow’s (1978) strategy types, given that all four strategy types need to deal with an
“entrepreneurial problem.” Therefore, the second research question is: Does a firm’s
strategy type moderate the EO–LO–performance relationship?

Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses
Conceptualization of EO and LO
The conceptualization of EO has been the focus of systematic inquiry in the literature (e.g., Covin et al., 2006; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Lyon, Lumpkin, & Dess, 2000),
and several key dimensions of the construct have emerged. Miller (1983) suggested that
a firm’s degree of entrepreneurship is the extent to which it innovates, acts proactively,
and takes risks. Lumpkin and Dess (1996) suggest that proactiveness and aggressiveness
are, indeed, distinct dimensions, albeit closely allied to each other. Proactiveness refers
to how firms relate to market opportunities in the process of new entry, and seize such
opportunities in order to shape the environment, while aggressiveness refers to how
firms relate to the competition and respond to trends and demands that already exist in
the marketplace. Given the existing conceptual insights, a continued theoretical debate
is beyond the focus of this study. Instead, this study adopts the four dimensions of
EO as market proactiveness, competitive aggressiveness, firm risk taking, and firm
innovativeness.
Market proactiveness refers to the extent to which a firm anticipates and acts on
future needs (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Miller & Friesen, 1978) by “seeking new opportunities which may or may not be related to the present line of operations, introduction
of new products and brands ahead of competition, strategically eliminating operations
which are in the mature or declining stages of life cycle” (Venkatraman, 1989, p. 949).
This definition overlaps with Miller’s (1983) conceptualization of innovativeness that
also bears an explicit focus on product market. For the purpose of conceptual distinction, this study considers the introduction of new products and services to capitalize on
market opportunities as an element of market proactiveness, and defines innovativeness
as “a firm’s tendency to engage in and support new ideas, novelty, experimentation, and
creative processes that may result in new products, services, or technological processes”
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 142). Innovative firms are those that exhibit innovative
behavior consistently over time. Competitive aggressiveness refers to “a firm’s propensity to directly and intensely challenge its competitors to achieve entry or improve
position, that is, to outperform industry rivals in the marketplace” (Lumpkin & Dess,
1996, p. 148). Firm risk taking refers to “the degree to which managers are willing to
make large and risky resource commitments—i.e., those which have a reasonable
chance of costly failures” (Miller & Friesen, 1978, p. 923). Risk taking is an important
dimension of EO as entrepreneurial firms tend to experience a higher level of external
and internal uncertainty.
The conceptualization of LO exhibits two focuses: some scholars emphasize concrete information generation and dissemination systems as the mechanism through
which learning takes place (Huber, 1991), while others consider firms as “cognitive
enterprises” and call for the need for a shared mental model, a shared organizational
vision, and an open-minded approach to problem solving (Senge, 1990). Organizational
learning is referred to as knowledge acquisition in the former view, and value acquisition in the latter (Sinkula et al., 1997). However, these two views must not be examined
July, 2008

637

<-----Page 3----->in isolation. A firm’s implicit or explicit understanding of how things should be done
(i.e., the theory in use) reflects its underlying values and norms, and influences its
action—“organizational learning occurs when members of the organization act as learning agents for the organization, responding to changes in the internal and external environment of the organization by detecting and correcting errors in the organizational
theory in use, and embedding the results of their inquiry in the private images and
shared maps of organization” (Argyris & Schön, 1978, p. 23). Hence, a firm’s values
and its behavior and processes associated with organizational learning are intrinsically
linked: learning-oriented values are manifested in a firm’s behavior and processes of
knowledge acquisition, creation, and transfer (Garvin, 1993); and as firms modify
behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights (Garvin, 1993), existing values and
norms are challenges, and new values are instilled. Sinkula et al. (1997, p. 314) reckon
that organizations may learn “actively or passively, by their own volition or through
force, as a luxury or by necessity, through systematic analysis or by trial and error, and
through long-term versus short-term feedback from a dynamic or stable environment.”
In other words, there is no “one way” that firms learn, and the paths and processes
involved in learning may differ among firms. Therefore Sinkula et al. (1997) do not
propose “the model” of organizational learning and, instead, propose that the quality
and efficiency at which a firm learns is a function of its core values.
This study takes Sinkula et al.’s (1997) view that the organizational values that
influence a firm’s learning propensity are fundamental when examining a firm’s overall
LO. In particular, three values are identified as salient. First, commitment to learning
refers to the extent to which a firm places value on learning (Sackmann, 1991). It is related
to Senge’s (1990) learning principles that call for organizations to place axiomatic value
on learning activities; in other words, firms must develop the ability to think and reason
(Tobin, 1993), and to value the need to understand the causes and effects of their actions
(Shaw & Perkins, 1991). Second, open-mindedness refers to the extent to which a firm
proactively questions long-held routines, assumptions, and beliefs (Sinkula et al., 1997),
and is linked to the notion of “unlearning” (Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984). Firms learn from
their past successes and failures, and such information is processed and embedded in their
mental models that influence the way of thinking and acting. These mental models may no
longer hold true when the external environment has changed (Day, 1994), and firms must
proactively question their mental models and engage in unlearning (Sinkula et al., 1997).
Third, shared vision refers to the extent to which a firm develops and holds a universally
understood organizational focus (Day, 1994), and gives organizational members a sense of
purpose and direction (Baker & Sinkula, 1999). A shared vision provides individuals, as
learning agents, the organizational expectations, outcomes to be measured, and theories in
use. Individuals that are open-minded and committed to learning are motivated to learn,
but may find it difficult to know what to learn unless a shared vision is in place (Sinkula
et al., 1997).
The three identified organizational values underpin two types of organizational
learning: adaptive and generative learning (Senge, 1990). Adaptive learning occurs
within a set of recognized and unrecognized organizational constraints (i.e., assumptions about its environment and itself ), and hence entails sequential and incremental
learning within the traditional scope of organizational activities (Slater & Narver, 1995).
The paradox is that a firm’s dominant logic can be an effective guide for the development of core capabilities, but left unquestioned, may become obsolete and irrelevant
over time (Leonard-Barton, 1992). Hamel and Prahalad (1991, p. 83) describe this as
the “tyranny of the served market,” where narrow business definitions impede the innovative search for unconventional business opportunities. For frame-breaking learning to
638

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->occur, a firm must be willing to question long-held assumptions about its mission,
customers, capabilities, or strategy—this is referred to as generative learning that, in
turn, requires fundamental understanding of the underlying cause–effect relationship
between the environment and the firm (Slater & Narver, 1995). Thus, generative learning is characterized as creativity, breakthrough, and organizational unlearning. The different natures of adaptive and generative learning indicate that for a higher order
generative learning to occur, a firm needs to challenge its existing mental model and
reach beyond the learning boundary for information or new ways of interpreting information (Slater & Narver, 1995). Conversely, adaptive learning reflects a firm’s propensity to behave in a “conservative” manner (Sadler-Smith, Spicer, & Chaston, 2001).
Therefore Sinkula et al. (1997) essentially argue that generative learning, relative to
adaptive learning, requires that a firm demonstrate a higher degree of commitment to
learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision.

EO, LO, and Firm Performance
The EO–performance literature is long-standing, and empirical studies have largely
found that firms with a more EO perform better (Wiklund, 1999; Zahra, 1991; Zahra &
Covin, 1995). Most recently, Rauch et al. (2004), based on a meta-analysis of 37
studies, conclude that the EO–performance relationship is moderately large and that
firms benefit from EO. On the other hand, the organizational learning literature bears a
performance-oriented focus: a firm’s ability to extract lessons from both successes and
failures and generate new insights is conducive to performance (Fiol & Lyles, 1985;
Senge, 1990; Sinkula, 1994). Therefore, organizational learning is considered by many
scholars as the key to firm success, and the ability to learn faster than competitors may
be the only source of sustainable competitive advantage (Dickson, 1992). Sadler-Smith
et al. (2001) note that there is descriptive evidence that the nuclear industry, British
Petroleum, financial services, and the automotive industry experienced the “power of
learning,” and those who learned quickest won the competitive “race.” Empirical findings also support that LO has a significant positive impact on performance (Baker &
Sinkula, 1999). It is, therefore, clear that EO and LO have positive effects on performance, respectively. However, the EO–LO–performance relationship remains underresearched.
Understanding the EO–LO–performance relationship in medium-to-large firms is
particularly important for several reasons. First, early research largely focuses on individual entrepreneurs’ experiential learning as an evolving process in entrepreneurial
start-up and growth (Cope, 2005; Reuber & Fischer, 1999; Smilor, 1997). The rise of
interest in corporate entrepreneurship, while recognizing the role of any number of actors
inside or outside the firm (Wiklund, 1999), draws attention to firms as collective entities
and requires better understanding of how firms learn and engage in entrepreneurial
activities in view of improved performance. Second, while a large body of work has
heretofore examined the interface of entrepreneurship and learning in the process of new
venture creation (e.g., Erikson, 2003), scholars have called for better understanding of the
learning process within existing entrepreneurial firms (Cope, 2005). The higher failure
rate in the first years of business start-up highlights the importance of continuous learning.
As firms grow larger, organizational learning plays a crucial role in updating their
resources and capabilities in line with the internal and external demand. Organizational
learning is a continuous process throughout the life of a firm, rather than just being
concentrated in the first few years (Reuber & Fischer, 1999), and plays an important role
in the entrepreneurial process in large, more established firms (Schildt, Maula, & Keil,
July, 2008

639

<-----Page 5----->2005). Within the context of medium-to-large firms, this study delineates the mediating
role of LO in the EO–performance relationship in further discussion.
First, entrepreneurial firms are risk tolerant and innovative. Such characteristics often
stimulate firms to eliminate the kind of traditional authoritarian, hierarchical structures
(particularly in medium-to-large firms) that inhibit collaborative learning (Kuratko,
Ireland, & Hornsby, 2001; Zahra, Kuratko, & Jennings, 1999). Entrepreneurial firms
instill flexibility, and grant individuals and teams the freedom to exercise their creativity
and to champion promising ideas (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Individuals are motivated and
inspired to learn in such environments and tend to demonstrate a higher level of commitment to learning (Drucker, 1999). A risk-tolerant and innovative orientation also means
that managers within the firm encourage new ways of thinking, tolerate mistakes, and
reward new ideas that contribute to innovation and business improvement (Miller &
Friesen, 1983). This promotes a sense of open-mindedness, since individuals are neither
constrained within a frame of thinking nor punished for making mistakes. Furthermore,
the breakdown of traditional authoritarian and hierarchical structures also brings about
organization-wide communications that facilitate the development of a shared vision.
Hence, EO creates a fertile internal environment for organizational learning to take place.
The more entrepreneurial a firm, the more learning-oriented it is, the more likely it instills
values that promote commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision.
Second, entrepreneurial firms pursue proactive action in the markets and aggressive
gestures toward competitors. Therefore, entrepreneurial firms engage in proactive and
extensive environmental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984; Miles & Snow, 1978), and
constantly face the challenge by new, external information. Hambrick (1982) found the
frequency of, interest in, and hours of entrepreneurial scanning were significantly greater
in prospector firms—the most entrepreneurial type as described by Miles and Snow
(1978). The environmental scanning serves as an impetus for information acquisition and
dissemination, an important starting point for learning: Executives can only interpret,
disseminate, and analyze information that enters the organization, and hence entrepreneurial environmental scanning is a key step in the process of organizational learning and
adaptation (Hambrick, 1982). Therefore, EO broadens firms’ scope for learning, particularly through exploration and experimentation (March, 1991).
However, to create performance effects it is most important that firms evaluate the
potential value of the acquired information to the firm based on the shared understanding
of the information, and use and act on the information to achieve the common organizational goals (Slater & Narver, 1995). Firms’ commitment to learning and receptivity to
new, external information (i.e., open-mindedness) are fundamental to the intensity of
learning, but learning is conducive to firm performance only when the learning efforts are
channeled effectively toward common organizational goals. Shared vision influences
the direction of learning and plays a crucial role in the mediating role of LO in the
EO–performance relationship. Developing a common entrepreneurial vision becomes
even more challenging when the firm reaches a size where more orderly management
systems are established and power needs to be shared (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). A firm’s
entrepreneurial vision must be conveyed at different levels of the firm in order to align
organizational goals with business processes. Overall, EO opens up a scope for learning
and particularly favors divergent learning, while LO emphasizes both intensity and a
common direction of learning, and hence the convergent effect of learning. Given the
previous discussion, this study hypothesizes that:
Hypothesis 1: The EO–performance relationship is mediated by LO; EO has a
positive impact on LO that, in turn, has a positive impact on firm performance.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->The Moderating Role of Strategy Types
Entrepreneurship is a key dimension of Miles and Snow’s strategy typology, i.e.,
prospectors, analyzers, defenders, and reactors. All four types of firms must deal with the
“entrepreneurial problem” (Miles & Snow, 1978). Prospectors approach the environment
more proactively and adapt to turbulent environments by using high levels of environmental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984). They seek to identify and exploit new opportunities through both product and market development (Miles & Snow, 1978). Defenders
attempt to create a stable domain by protecting their product-market and prosper through
stability, reliability, and efficiency (Slater & Narver, 1995). Analyzers prosper by purposely being more innovative in their product-market initiatives than defenders, but doing
so more cautiously and selectively than prospectors (Hambrick, 2003). In practice, an
analyzer strategy is, indeed, the most difficult one for firms to carefully pursue: The
analyzer is a “unique combination of the Prospector and Defender types” (Miles & Snow,
1978, p. 68). Analyzers seek effectiveness through both efficiency and new products and
markets; their dual focus results in increased size because the firm must engage in both
mass production and research and development (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). Reactors
rank the lowest in all dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior (Slater & Narver, 1995).
Miles and Snow (1978) initially proposed the reactor type as a fourth ideal strategy type
but later described it as a “residual” type of behavior in that firms are forced into this
response mode only when they are unable to pursue one of the first three strategies. Doty
et al. (1993) find empirical support for the first three ideal types with the defender type and
the prospector type at opposite ends of a strategy continuum and the analyzer between
these two extremes; the reactor type is, indeed, a residual type as evidenced in their study.
One way to distinguish prospectors from analyzers and defenders is through examining the type of organizational learning involved. Prospectors invest a great deal in
technological innovation, development of new ideas, and creation of market awareness,
and therefore pioneer industry changes. As a result, the prospector strategy often involves
more radical departures from firms’ existing products, markets, administrative procedures,
and even mental models and dominant logic than the analyzer and the defender types
(Miles & Snow, 1978). Hence, prospectors are involved in a high degree of generative
learning. Conversely, defenders mainly engage in adaptive learning that focuses on existing products and markets and improving business processes within their familiar domain.
Analyzers lie between prospectors and defenders—on one hand, they are often depicted
as imitators, but when opportunities arise they may overtake prospectors by building on
prospectors’ innovation and tailoring their innovative products and services offerings
to customer needs (Hambrick, 1982). Analyzers learn from prospectors’ successes and
failures and capitalize on the mass market. Therefore, analyzers engage in a combination
of adaptive learning (e.g., refinement of existing knowledge and incremental changes in
business processes and product-market choices) and to some extent generative learning
(e.g., the adoption of industry innovation that is beyond their existing domain). It must be
noted that the extent of generative learning is greater for prospectors than for analyzers.
With particular reference to innovation, prospectors, analyzers, and defenders are
pioneers, followers, and late adopters, respectively.
Generative learning is forward looking, and hence reduces the frequency and magnitude of major shocks (Day, 1994; Sinkula, 1994). Firms that engage in higher-order
generative learning have close and extensive relationships with customers, suppliers, and
other key constituencies, and possess a cooperative attitude that facilitates mutual adjustment when the unexpected occurs (Webster, 1992). Such firms demonstrate higher flexibility, and hence are able to quickly reconfigure their structure and renew resources and

Thus, compared with analyzers and defenders, prospectors demonstrate a higher EO that
stimulates a higher degree of generative learning that, in turn, has a positive impact
on performance. Hence, this study hypothesizes:
Hypothesis 2: The EO–LO–performance relationship is moderated by firm strategy;
prospectors are likely to demonstrate stronger linkages in the EO–LO–performance
relationship than analyzers, followed by defenders.

Methods
Sample
The data of this study were gathered via a mailed survey (using 7-point Likert scales)
in 2003. Prior to the questionnaire design, six exploratory interviews were conducted with
executives in three companies. The survey instrument incorporated insights generated
from the interview data, and was subsequently pretested among nine managers who
participated in a public lecture organized by the university and three university academics
with expertise in entrepreneurship and organizational learning. Following this, two interviews were undertaken with two executives from two companies to collect their feedback
and experience of filling in the questionnaire. Their comments were incorporated in
designing the final questionnaire.
A sample of 1,500 U.K.-based firms (each with at least 50 employees—a criterion for
medium-to-large firms defined by the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry) randomly
selected from the FAME database were sent a questionnaire with a cover letter to the
company director or senior executive, and a prepaid return envelope. As the addressee was
requested to either fill in the questionnaire if appropriate, or identify a most suitable
person in the company to complete it, the respondents were primarily executives or senior
managers including Managing Director, Director of Organizational Learning, Director of
Intellectual Capital, Human Resource Director, Chief Information Officer, etc. Following
two reminders, a total of 231 questionnaires were received: a 15.4% response rate. After
discounting nonvalid and incomplete responses, 213 usable responses remained (46.5% in
service industries and 53.5% in manufacturing industries), and were subsequently used
in the analysis.
ANOVA tests were performed to examine possible nonresponse bias, as suggested by
Armstrong and Overton (1977). Respondents were divided into three groups based on
whether they responded to the first mailing, the first follow-up, or the second follow-up.
It is assumed that the group who responded to the second follow-up is most similar to
nonrespondents (Armstrong & Overton, 1977). The results revealed that there was no
significant difference between the three groups on EO, LO, firm performance, firm age,
and firm size and thus there was no evidence of systematic nonresponse bias.

Measures
The data analysis of this study follows a two-step procedure: assessing measurement
models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), followed by assessing path relationships
using structural equation modeling (SEM) (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The statistical
software AMOS 6.0 was employed and the Maximum Likelihood estimation method was
used. The model fit was assessed using c2/df, goodness-of-fit index (GFI; Jöreskog &
642

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->Sörbom, 1996), and the comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1992).1 The threshold for
c2/df should be less than 3.0, or less than 2.0 in a more restrictive sense (Premkumar &
King, 1994). Values of GFI and CFI should be over 0.90.
This study based the measure for EO on Miller (1983). Subsequent studies (e.g.,
Covin & Slevin, 1986, 1989; Naman & Slevin, 1993) extended and refined the scale that
is now referred to as the Miller/Covin and Slevin scale (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund,
2001). Wiklund (1998) identified at least twelve studies based on this scale, and these
studies suggested that this measure is a viable instrument for capturing firm-level entrepreneurship. Proactiveness is assessed by asking managers about the firm’s tendency to
lead, rather than follow, in terms of developing new procedures, technologies, and new
products or services (Covin & Slevin, 1989; Miller & Friesen, 1978). Aggressiveness is
measured by competitive processes used by managers to pursue rivals or take up new
competitors, since its point of reference is the competition (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Firm
risk taking is assessed by asking managers about the firm’s propensity to engage in risky
projects and managers’ preference for bold versus cautious acts to achieve firm objectives
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Lumpkin and Dess (1996) reckon that most entrepreneurship
research based on Miller’s (1983) concept of innovativeness demonstrates a common
weakness, that is, Miller (1983) focused exclusively on the product-market and technological aspects of innovation and lacked measures for a firm’s overall propensity of
innovative behavior. Given this, this study adapted two items from Miller and Friesen
(1983) and one item from Hurt, Joseph, and Cook (1977) to measure firm innovativeness.
In total, 11 items were included in the EO scale. Details of the items are included in the
Appendix. CFA tests were performed, with EO as a higher-order latent construct, consisting of the four first-order indicators. The measurement model resulted in a good fit:
c2 = 79.771, df = 40, p = 0.000, c2/df = 1.994, GFI = 0.938, CFI = 0.960. The first-order
loadings ranged from 0.52 to 0.93 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001). The second-order loadings ranged
from 0.60 to 0.99 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
This study adopted the LO scale developed by Sinkula et al. (1997) and retested by
Baker and Sinkula (1999) who found further support for its validity and reliability. The
higher-order LO construct consisted of 11 items partitioned into three first-order factors
(i.e., commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision). Commitment to
learning is measured through examining the extent to which firms place value on organizational learning and consider learning as an investment rather than expenses (Sinkula
et al., 1997). Open-mindedness is measured through examining whether a firm critically
reflects on existing assumptions and business processes (Sinkula et al., 1997). Shared
vision is measured by examining the extent to which a firm holds a common goal at
different levels and promotes a sense of direction (Baker & Sinkula, 1999). The model fit
indexes indicated an adequate fit: c2 = 99.637, df = 41, p = 0.000, c2/df = 2.430,
GFI = 0.923, CFI = 0.954. All loadings were significant (t > 1.96, p < 0.001), the firstorder loadings ranging from 0.43 to 0.89 and the second-order loadings ranging from 0.75
to 0.94 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
This study ascribes to the view that performance comparisons with competitors reveal
important information (Birley & Westhead, 1990; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003). Therefore,
three subjective indicators were used to measure firm performance: respondents were
asked to compare the return on capital employed, earnings per share, and sales growth of
1. Results of c2, df, and p-value are also reported in this study. c2 is sensitive to sample size and assumes a
perfect fit between the hypothesized model and the sample data. In complex models c2 tends to be very large,
and its associated p-value tends to indicate insignificance. Hence, researchers often use c2/df instead to
address the limitations of c2.

in a good fit: c2 = 1.800, df = 1, p = 0.180, c2/df = 1.800, GFI = 0.994, CFI = 0.996. The
loading of each indicator to the overall performance factors was significant, ranging from
0.58 to 0.85 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
For each construct, the dimensionality of each item was assessed by the loadings and
their associated t-ratios (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The results showed that each item
loaded significantly on only its respective first-order factor, and subsequently the higherorder construct, without cross-loading to any other first-order factor of the same construct.
Reliability was assessed by using both coefficient alpha (Peter, 1979) and composite
reliability (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). The alpha for EO was 0.87, and for each first-order
factor ranged from 0.67 to 0.86. The composite reliability of EO was 0.85, and for each
first-order factor ranged from 0.68 to 0.87. The alpha for LO was 0.90, and for each
first-order factor ranged from 0.62 to 0.89. The composite reliability for LO was 0.89, and
for each first-order factor ranged from 0.65 to 0.89. All assessed indicators for reliability
were above the acceptance level for the study constructs. Convergent validity was examined by assessing the average variance extracted (AVE; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). All the
AVEs for the study constructs and their respective first-order factors were above 0.5,
which is the indicative threshold recommended by Bagozzi and Yi (1988). The discriminant validity was assessed by comparing AVE of each of the first-order factor with the
shared variances of this first-order factor with any other first-order factors of the study
constructs. All AVEs were higher than all shared variances, indicating discriminant validity of the study constructs. Table 1 shows the results of the measurement analysis.
Strategy types were measured using categorical data following Miles and Snow’s
(1978) strategy typology: prospectors (n = 71), analyzers (n = 70), defenders (n = 41), and
reactors (n = 22). Research has found strong and consistent support for the basic validity
of the typology in a wide array of settings (e.g., hospitals, colleges, banking, industry
products, and life insurance; Hambrick, 2003). A self-typing measure (where informants
are asked to identify the description of a strategy type that is closest to their company
strategy) was adapted from Snow and Hrebiniak (1980). This self-typing approach has
been used by many scholars (e.g., McKee, Varadarajan, & Pride, 1989; Vorhies &

study included a control variable: industry type. Two broad industry groups were identified, namely manufacturing (n = 114) and services (n = 99).
This study relies on self-reported data from single informants. This introduces the
potential of common method variance (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003).
Several studies (Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Spector, 1987; Williams, Cote, & Buckley, 1989)
examined the effect of common method variance and resulted in mixed findings.2 Scholars
are cautious and recommend both procedural and statistical methods to minimize the bias
(Podsakoff et al., 2003; Tepper & Tepper, 1993). In this study, respondents were assured
of the confidentiality and anonymity to reduce evaluation apprehension (a procedure
recommended by Podsakoff et al., 2003). Moreover, this study conducted the Harman’s
one-factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986), a technique often adopted by researchers to
examine the common method bias. All variables of the EO, LO, and firm performance
constructs were entered into an exploratory factor analysis. The results revealed that no
single factor emerged from this analysis, nor was there a general factor which could
account for the majority of variance in these variables: the first factor accounted for only
18.8% of the total variance. Thus, this indicates that common method bias is not a major
problem in this study.

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The Mediating Effect of LO
This study follows the SEM approach to testing the mediating effect as suggested by
James, Mulaik, and Brett (2004):3 A full mediating model should be tested with a path
from the independent variable (EO) to the mediator (LO) and a path from the mediator
(LO) to the dependent variable (firm performance); a direct relationship between the
independent variable (EO) and dependent variable (firm performance) is not expected, and
hence a direct path does not need to be included. The approach has been supported by
MacKinnon et al. (2002) and Schneider et al. (2005). The SEM model in this study,
consisting of three latent constructs (i.e., EO, LO, and firm performance as shown in
Figure 1) resulted in an adequate fit and the model fit indexes were: c2 = 89.325, df = 33,
p = 0.000, c2/df = 2.707, GFI = 0.920, CFI = 0.932. The loading of EO to LO was significant (0.83, t = 8.310, p < 0.001). The loading of LO to firm performance was also
2. Spector (1987), based on multitrait-multimethod analyses, concluded that common method bias tended to
be small and rarely statistically significant, and its effect on relations among variables were “minor at best.”
Conversely, Williams et al. (1989) reanalyzed Spector’s (1987) data using confirmatory factor analysis and
found that common method variance was prevalent and accounted for approximately 25% of the variance in
the measures. Furthermore, Bagozzi and Yi (1990) provided additional analyses and concluded that common
method variance was less prevalent than Williams et al. (1989) claimed but more prevalent than Spector
(1987) asserted.
3. James et al. (2004) and Schneider, Erhart, Mayer, Saltz, and Niles-Jolly (2005) reckon that the SEM
approach and Baron and Kenny’s (1986) regression approach to testing mediation share many similarities and
differences. A key difference is that Baron and Kenny’s (1986) approach presumes a partial mediation baseline
model that is inappropriate for the SEM approach. Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998) updated Baron and
Kenny’s (1986) approach and noted that step 1 of the original Baron and Kenny’s procedure (i.e., the
independent variable is linked directly to the dependent variable) is not required and the essential steps in
establishing mediation are steps 2 and 3. MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) noted
that the SEM approach provides the best balance of type I error rates and statistical power relative to Baron
and Kenny’s approach. James et al. (2004) and Schneider et al. (2005) provide a detailed discussion on the two
approaches.

significant (0.53, t = 6.125, p < 0.001). The results support hypothesis 1: LO mediates the
EO–performance relationship.

The Moderating Effect of Strategy Type
The strength of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance relationship was compared
between the prospector type (n = 71) and the analyzer type (n = 70). The defender type
(n = 41) and the reactor type (n = 22) resulted in insufficient sample size for structural
equation modeling. Most importantly, the prospector and the analyzer types are referred
to as two close, but distinct entrepreneurial groups in the strategy continuum (Doty et al.,
1993). Hence, it is worthwhile testing if there are any differences between the two strategy
types in the modeled relationships.
The prospectors and the analyzers were submitted for the multigroup analysis
(Jöreskog, Sörbom, Du Toit, & Du Toit, 1999) of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance
relationship. Anderson and Gerbing’s (1982) c2 difference test was used to evaluate if the
differences in the modeled relationships are statistically significant across groups. First,
the unconstrained model (where both paths of EO–LO and LO–performance were allowed
to vary freely across groups) was tested and resulted in c2 = 79.871, df = 66. Second, three
constrained models were tested: the constrained model A (where only the EO–LO path
was specified as equal across groups) resulted in c2 = 84.121, df = 67; the constrained
model B (where only LO–performance path was specified as equal across groups) resulted
in c2 = 80.055, df = 67; the constrained model C (where both paths of EO–LO and
LO–performance were specified as equal across groups, respectively) resulted in
c2 = 84.153, df = 68. The c2 results of the constrained model A and C were significantly
higher than the unconstrained model (p < 0.05), whilst the increase of c2 of the constrained model B was not significant. Details are reported in Table 2.
The results indicate that there was significant difference in the EO–LO–performance
relationship between the prospectors and the analyzers and thus hypothesis 2 is supported:
the links of EO–LO–performance vary in strength between prospectors and analyzers.

More specifically, the significant difference occurred in the strength of EO–LO that varied
between the prospectors and the analyzers. The results of the unconstrained model showed
that the loadings from EO to LO were 0.92 for prospectors and 0.86 for analyzers, and the
loadings from LO to performance were 0.43 for prospectors and 0.36 for analyzers.

Results of Control Variable
To test the stability of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance relationship across
industry groups, this study used a multigroup analysis to test if there was any difference
in the hypothesized relationships across the two broad industry groups: manufacturing
(n = 114) and services (n = 99). The unconstrained model resulted in c2 = 135.769,
df = 66. Three constrained models were compared with this unconstrained model: The
constrained model A (where only the path of EO–LO was specified as equal across
groups) resulted in c2 = 135.877, df = 67; the constrained model B (where only the path of
LO–performance was specified as equal across groups) resulted in c2 = 136.083, df = 67;
the constrained model C (where both paths of EO–LO and LO–performance were specified as equal across groups, respectively) resulted in c2 = 136.123, df = 68. The c2 of each
constrained model was not significantly higher than the unconstrained model, indicating
there was no difference in the EO–LO–performance relationship across the two industry
groups. Results are reported in Table 2.

Discussion
This study set out a task to examine the EO–LO–performance relationship and
whether their links vary in strength across Miles and Snow’s (1978) strategy types. First,
July, 2008

647

<-----Page 13----->this study found that the EO–performance relationship was mediated by a firm’s LO—a
missing link in prior literature. More specifically, this study found that firm innovativeness, relative to market proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness, had higher correlation coefficients with each of the first-order factors of LO (0.505 with commitment to
learning, 0.589 with shared vision, and 0.607 with open-mindedness) as shown in Table 1.
This is because innovativeness and LO both have a stronger internal orientation toward
business processes and self-renewal, whilst proactiveness and aggressiveness both have a
stronger external orientation toward the market and the competition. Innovative firms
encourage people to seek unusual and novel solutions, and tolerate mistakes (Hurt et al.,
1977; Miller & Friesen, 1983). Therefore, individuals within the firm are motivated
to learn and more receptive to new information. Furthermore, innovative firms often
adopt cross-functional teams (Kuratko et al., 2001), rather than traditional authoritarian
and hierarchical structures, to facilitate communications that, in turn, bring about an
organization-wide consensus of goals and directions. Hence, innovative firms instill
values of commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision.
Risk taking had lowest correlation coefficients with all first-order factors of LO
(0.252, 0.248, and 0.308, respectively). The first impression is that the findings seem
contradictory to March’s (1991) prediction: risk taking is associated with exploration and
discovery of new, external information. However, a closer examination reveals that firms
must strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, and that firms engaging in
exploration to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to suffer the costs of experimentation without gaining its benefits (March, 1991). Firms with a distinct focus on risk taking
and exploration result in too many underdeveloped new ideas (March, 1991), and suffer
from diverted efforts and scattered internal resources rather than maintaining a focused
direction. This explains that risk taking had a low correction with LO, particularly shared
vision. Risk tolerance is an important characteristic of entrepreneurial firms, but highly
risky actions are not necessarily conducive to learning and consequently to performance
(0.197); instead, careful study of potential risks and mitigating risks is, indeed, a learning
process. One example of minimizing the risk and maximizing learning in product innovation is to work extensively with lead customers (Von Hippel, 1986).
Among all the first-order factors of LO, shared vision had the highest correlation with
firm performance (0.407). This is consistent with our prediction and the theory: although
EO creates a fertile internal environment and broadens the scope for organizational
learning to occur, in medium-to-large firms an entrepreneurial vision must be shared
effectively among all organizational members in order to bring about a positive effect on
performance (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). Failing this, the reality of a firm would be
featured by highly enthusiastic and committed individuals pulling the firm toward different directions. The previous findings collectively reveal that firms must develop a vision
and, above all, communicate it to people at different levels. Without a focus, entrepreneurial efforts are thinned without reaping performance benefits. Hence, shared vision is
a crucial element in the mediating role of LO in the EO–performance relationship.
Second, the results of the multigroup analysis reveal that between the prospectors and
the analyzers there were significant differences in the EO–LO–performance relationship.
More specifically, the differences occurred in the EO–LO relationship; EO had a stronger
positive impact on LO for prospectors (0.92, t = 7.158, p < 0.001) than for analyzers
(0.86, t = 3.938, p < 0.001). Prospectors are often involved in questioning existing
assumptions, beliefs, values, and mental models, and challenging existing routines, products, markets, and competition (Miles & Snow, 1978). These characteristics are related to
generative learning. Analyzers more often engage in exploitation of existing knowledge
and technologies and make adaptation. Therefore, the results reinforce the message that
648

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->LO is, indeed, an important mediating factor in the examination of the EO–performance
relationship, and an insightful dimension (along with EO) that distinguishes Miles and
Snow’s (1978) strategy types.
Business practices exemplify the EO–LO–performance relationship: EO may positively influence LO through stimulating firms to “unlearn” old ways of doing things; or
through enabling flexibility and facilitating firms to reconfigure their skills and talents.
An example for the former route was observed by Zahra et al. (1999): in the late 1980s
throughout the 1990s large firms, in light of entrepreneurial spirit that favors change and
innovation, went through organizational transformation through reorganization, downsizing, and restructuring. Such organizational transformation resulted in the removal of
obsolete organizational routines (i.e., unlearning) and enabled a higher-order generative
learning to occur. An example of the latter route is exhibited in the study of Kuratko et al.
(2001): Acordia’s entrepreneurship strategy enabled decentralization and the formation
of new venture teams—cross-functional teams acting as a primary source of processes,
products, and market innovativeness. Such new venture teams instilled flexibility and
served as a mechanism of skills reconfiguration, which is instrumental to Acordia’s
learning process through pooling talents, facilitating sharing of tacit knowledge, encouraging collective learning, and empowering employees to be creative and responsive to
market opportunities. Research results and business practices support that EO has a
positive impact on LO that, in turn, is conducive to firm performance.

Research Limitations and Practical Implications
As in any study, the findings of this paper must be viewed in light of its boundaries
and limitations. Conceptually, this study developed a research model and articulated
the EO–LO–performance relationship in a particular way to capture characteristics of
medium-to-large firms and to focus on firm-level learning and entrepreneurial behavior.
Future research examining the EO–LO relationship in micro or small firms must take into
account individual entrepreneurs’ learning that plays a key role in the firm’s learning
process, and develop alternative models. Moreover, Sinkula et al.’s (1997) LO construct
only captures a firm’s values that underpin its general tendency toward organizational
learning, but does not directly measure the extent to which a firm engages in adaptive or
generative learning. Given that generative and adaptive learning are paramount to gauge
the extent of a firm’s EO, future research must endeavor to develop an effective measurement for LO that conceptually captures the behavior and processes involved in the two
types of organizational learning.
Methodologically, this study relied on self-reported data from single informants.
Although the Harman’s one-factor test results indicated that common method bias is not
a major problem in this study, the interpretation of the findings must be viewed in light of
this limitation. According to Williams et al. (1989), common method bias may account for
more than 25% of the variance between perceptual and attitudinal variables. Therefore,
the strong relationships of EO–LO (0.83) and then LO–performance (0.53) should be
discounted accordingly. Moreover, given that the sample of this study included only
medium-to-large, established firms, and that SEM puts high demand on sample size in
relation to the number of parameters estimated, this study did not control firm size and age
in the examination of hypothesized relationships. Firm age is particularly important in the
examination of LO in smaller entrepreneurial firms during the start-up, breakout, and
mature stages. Future research should include a more heterogeneous sample, controlling
the effect of firm size and age. Finally, this study dropped the defender and reactor types
in the multigroup analysis due to the constraint of the sample size. Since the findings
July, 2008

649

<-----Page 15----->reveal that LO is an important dimension in addition to EO to distinguish Miles and
Snow’s (1978) strategy types, future research should include all strategy types in a
systematic study of the EO–LO relationship.
Despite the limitations, this study contributes to the EO–performance relationship by
providing empirical evidence to support that LO mediates and firm strategy moderates the
effect of EO on firm performance. The managerial implications are that for medium-tolarge firms, the challenges for channeling their entrepreneurial resources toward the
improvement of firm performance are mainly three-fold: First, the entrepreneurial spirit
must be shared at different levels within the firm—developing a shared vision is particularly important alongside maintaining open-mindedness and commitment to learning.
Second, larger firms, unfortunately, often mean many management layers and slow decision making. Championing an entrepreneurial spirit that favors change may help the firm
to streamline business processes, promote autonomous decision-making, and tap into
individuals’ creative power—these will engender a higher order generative learning that
requires the desertion of old traditions. Third, firms must endeavor to balance adaptive and
generative learning in line with their chosen firm strategy, allowing for exploration and
experimentation as well as fully developing existing ideas. Firms engaging in adaptive
learning to the exclusion of generative learning may find themselves stuck in a “competence trap,” while those engaging in generative learning to the exclusion of adaptive
learning may find their resources and efforts too spread out to reap any performance
benefits.

Conclusion
Creating wealth is at the heart of entrepreneurship (Ireland, Hill, Camp, & Sexton,
2001). The findings of this study enhance the understanding of the EO–performance
relationship in several aspects: in medium-to-large firms EO is important for performance;
LO is an important mediator in the EO–performance relationship; and the EO–LO link is
stronger for the prospectors than the analyzers. Entrepreneurial firms must foster organizational learning in order to maximize the effect of EO on performance.

This organization typically operates within a broad product-market domain that undergoes periodic redefinition.
The organization values being “first in” in new product and market areas even if not all of these efforts prove
to be highly profitable. The organization responds rapidly to early signals concerning areas of opportunity, and
these responses often lead to a new round of competitive actions. However, this organization may not maintain
market strength in all of the areas it enters.
This organization attempts to maintain a stable, limited line of products or services, while at the same time moving
out quickly to follow a carefully selected set of the more promising new developments in the industry. The
organization is seldom “first in” with new products or services. However, by carefully monitoring the actions of
major competitors in areas compatible with its stable product-market base, the organization can frequently be “second
in” with a more cost-efficient product or service.
This organization attempts to locate and maintain a secure niche in a relatively stable product or service area. The
organization tends to offer a more limited range of products or services than its competitors, and it tries to protect
its domain by offering higher quality, superior service, lower prices, and so forth. Often this organization is not at
the forefront of developments in the industry—it tends to ignore industry changes that have no direct influence on
current areas of operation and concentrates instead on doing the best job possible in a limited area.
This organization does not appear to have a consistent product-market orientation. The organization is usually not as
aggressive in maintaining established products and markets as some of its competitors, nor is it willing to take as
many risks as other competitors. Rather, the organization responds in those areas where it is forced to by environmental
pressures.

Notes: (1) Respondents were asked to tick only one of the above statements that most closely described their organization.
(2) The above measure was adopted from Snow and Hrebiniak (1980).
