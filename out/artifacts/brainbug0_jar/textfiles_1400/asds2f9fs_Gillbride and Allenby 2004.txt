Introduction

introducing additional parameters and error terms
into the model. We propose an alternative approach
that deals directly with the irregularity of the likelihood surface, preserving the thresholds and discontinuities that are implied by theory.
In this paper we investigate consumers' use of
screening rules as part of a discrete-choice model.
Alternatives that pass the screen are evaluated in
a manner consistent with random utility theory;
alternatives that do not pass the screen have a
zero probability of being chosen. Behaviorally, consumers adopt a "rule" to screen alternatives; this rule
may be the result of previous learning, informationprocessing constraints, or solving some previous constrained optimization problem. The reduced-form
model we propose is consistent with various theories
presented in the consideration set and informationprocessing literature.
The proposed model accommodates conjunctive,
disjunctive, and compensatory screening rules. It is
formulated for revealed choice data when process
measures or other data, such as acceptable alternatives or attributes, are not available. A primary contribution of this paper is the formulation and estimation
of a choice model that reflects a discontinuous decision process. Our approach employs the Bayesian

Many theories of consumer behavior involve thresholds and discontinuities. The amount consumers are
willing to pay for a lottery ticket is different than the
amount they will pay to insure against a commensurate loss. A threshold occurs at the point where a gain
turns into a loss. Consumers in the market for a new
minivan may not consider offerings above a certain
price because they exceed their budget constraints, or
because past experience has taught them that higherpriced vehicles are not a good value. When going out
for dinner, the restaurants considered may be very
different than those considered at lunch. Prospect theory, microeconomics, reference prices, and consideration sets all involve abrupt behavior changes under
certain discrete circumstances.
Thresholds and discontinuities are problematic for
empirical researchers because they can lead to a
likelihood surface that is not differentiable. In a
discrete-choice model, the presence of a consideration
set leads to abrupt changes in the choice probability
as items move into and out of the set. Gradient-based
estimation procedures, such as Newton-Raphson and
the method of scoring, are not appropriate in these
situations because they require a continuous and differentiable likelihood function. Researchers have used
various methods to "smooth out" the likelihood by

technique of data augmentation and uses Markovchain Monte Carlo methods to integrate over the
parameter space. The approach has minimal information requirements and can handle a large number of
choice alternatives.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In ee2
and 3 we discuss two-stage decision processes and
how they relate to screening rules. In e4 we describe
our modeling approach and how it overcomes difficulties associated with a discontinuous likelihood surface. Section 5 introduces an empirical example in the
context of a choice-based conjoint study for a new
camera type. Results are presented in e6, where we
find that 92% of the survey respondents use some
form of noncompensatory screening when choosing
among the choice options. Implications and directions
for future research are discussed in e7.

2.

Two-Stage Decision Processes

Consumers use various decision rules to simplify
complicated decision tasks. The choice model proposed in this paper is consistent with two-stage
decision processes wherein a subset of product
alternatives is selected from the universal set, and
the final product choice is from the reduced set.
Theoretical motivation for this two-stage process can
be found in the consideration set and informationprocessing literatures.
The term "consideration set" has been used in various ways in the marketing literature. Shocker et al.
(1991, p. 183) define consideration sets as being "purposefully constructed and can be viewed as consisting of those goal-satisfying alternatives salient or
accessible on a particular occasion." Hence, consideration sets are linked to usage occasion. Alternatively, Hauser and Wernerfelt (1990) define consideration sets as a subset of offerings that receive serious
consideration during the purchase occasion. Regardless of its use, researchers in marketing have generally operationalized consideration sets as comprising alternatives that survive a screening process (see
Hdiubl and Trifts 2000).
Consideration sets have been modeled as the solution to a consumer optimization problem. Hauser and
Wernerfelt (1990) provide a model where the expected
utility of consumption must exceed the cognitive cost
of evaluation for an alternative to be considered.
Roberts and Lattin (1991) operationalize this approach
using survey data, and Mehta et al. (2003) extend
this structural approach to scanner panel data where
explicit information on consideration sets is not available. These approaches assume that the overall utility
of the offering determines inclusion in the consideration set (see also Montgomery et al. 2003).
An information-processing view of the consumer
leads to consideration sets determined by product

attributes, not overall utility. These models typically have a less effortful first stage, followed by a
more comprehensive second stage. Payne (1976) and
Bettman and Park (1980) provide evidence that the
formation of the consideration set is linked to a subset of attributes and that the final selection is more
holistic. Bettman et al. (1998) provide an overview
of consumer decision strategies, including the use of
various conjunctive (i.e., intersection) and disjunctive
(i.e., union) rules that can be used for set formation.
Bettman (1979), Shugan (1980), and Bettman et al.
(1990) show that adopting a screening rule based on
a subset of attributes is a rational outcome for a decision maker willing to tradeoff accuracy against cognitive effort.
Our model relies entirely on revealed choices
and can accommodate holistic (i.e., overall utility)
and attribute-based screens. It does not incorporate
information that can be used to determine the process
by which "seriously considered" alternatives are identified, nor does it require respondents to identify the
set of alternatives that pass the screen. Hence, it is
a reduced-form model that is consistent with the literature on consideration sets. To minimize confusion
with prior research, we refer to the set of alternatives
that pass the screening rule in a given context as the
choice set.

3.

Screening Rules

The screening rules restrict the set of alternatives
that are evaluated for final selection. The alternatives
included in the choice set are identified with an indicator function,
y), that equals one if the decision
and equals zero otherwise. The choice
rule is satisfied I(xj,
model can then be written in general form as
Pr(i) = Pr(Vi + Ei > Vj +

for all j such that

(1)
I(xj, y)-= 1)
where Vi denotes the deterministic portion of utility
of choice alternative i, Ei is the stochastic portion and
it is assumed that the stochastic terms are distributed
independently, xj denotes a generic argument of an
indicator function (I) that reflects the decision rule
applied to the jth offering. Alternative screening rules
can be investigated with the indicator function relationship, I(xj, y) = 1. Flexibility exists in the specification of this relationship because its complexity does
not increase the complexity of estimating the choice
model, as discussed in e4.
For example, if price is used to screen the alternatives so that only offerings above a lower thresh>

I(-pricei > y). Here, y is a parameter to be estimated. This formulation allows for dynamic choice
sets when an attribute (e.g., price) changes over the
choice history.
A compensatory screening rule is one where the
deterministic portion of the utility of the offering
must exceed a threshold value to be acceptable.
Compensatory Rule:

I(Vj > y)= 1.

(2)

This screening rule is consistent with consideration sets based on consumer optimization models (see
especially Roberts and Lattin 1991). Assuming that
the stochastic portion of utility has an expected value
of 0, Vj is the expected utility from the offering and ythe cognitive cost of considering an offering.
Two noncompensatory screening rules consistent
with the information-processing literature are also
modeled: conjunctive and disjunctive. Choice sets
formed by a conjunctive decision rule require that an
alternative be acceptable on all relevant attributes for
it to be included. A conjunctive rule is formed by multiplying indicator functions across the attributes (m)
of an offering:
Conjunctive

Rule:

H I(xjm > Ym)= 1,

(3)

is the level of attribute m for choice alterwhere
xim
native j. The cutoff value, 7m, is the smallest level
of the attribute that needs to be present for the decision maker to consider the offering. If the cutoff value
is smaller than all levels of the attribute, then the
attribute is not used to screen. For nominally scaled
attributes (i.e., 0, 1 attributes), a cutoff value greater
than zero indicates that the attribute is required. Use
of the product
results in a conjunctive combinam,,
tion of the factors where all components must be satisfied for the combination to be satisfied.
The conjunctive screening rule is consistent with an
elimination-by-aspects screening process. One might
hypothesize that a consumer identifies her most
important attribute and eliminates any alternatives
not exceeding a certain threshold. Then she may move
onto her second-most important attribute, eliminating any alternatives not exceeding a certain level on
that attribute, etc. Note that the order in which the
attributes are examined doesn't matter: The end result
is that each attribute must be above a specific threshold to be considered. This is identical to the conjunctive screening rule used in the model.
A disjunctive decision rule is one where at least one
of the attribute levels is acceptable:
Disjunctive Rule:

E I(xjm> Ym) 1.
>m

(4)

We note that the conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules directly relate the choice set to specific levels

393

of the attributes. Estimates of y, will indicate which
attributes, and what levels, are critical to consumers.
Screening rules consistent with consumer optimization (compensatory) and information-processing (conjunctive and disjunctive) theories have been proposed
to represent two-stage decision making. Our reducedform model, Equation (1), however, does not require
that consumers form a choice set first, and then
choose from that set. The mathematical representation is silent on any specific procedure. However, it
does capture the sharp discontinuity in the underlying behavioral model: Alternatives with unacceptable
attribute levels (or combinations of attributes) have a
zero probability of selection. A method for estimating
the model is discussed next.

Estimating Choice Models with
Screening Rules

Consideration or choice-set models have been applied
in a variety of domains, including the analysis of survey data (Gensch 1987), scanner panel data (Manrai
and Andrews 1998), and data collected in laboratory
settings (Johnson and Meyer 1984). Johnson et al.
(1989) and Andrews and Manrai (1998) demonstrate
that parameter bias and incorrect inferences result
when the decision process is not correctly modeled.
Choice sets induce a complicated structure in the
likelihood function. Consider, for example, a simple
discrete-choice model without choice sets. The choice
probability is
Pr(i) = Pr(Vi + Ei > Vj + ej for all j)
= Pr(ej < Vi - VI+ Ei for all j)

where Vi denotes the deterministic portion of utilis the stochastic portion,
ity of choice alternative i,
and it is assumed that theEistochastic terms are distributed independently. The probit model is obtained
by assuming that the stochastic terms are distributed
normal, and the logit model is obtained when the
stochastic terms are distributed extreme value. The
discrete-choice probabilities are derived by partitioning the domain of the error space corresponding to
a choice outcome, and integrating the error densities
over the corresponding region. The regions for a simple discrete-choice model are indicated in the upper
and lower limits of the integrals.
The likelihood for an observed sequence of choices
is the product of the choice probabilities:
f(V I data) =- r(data I V) = H Pr(i).

The likelihood surface for simple discrete-choice
models is continuous and globally concave (Maddala
1983). Small changes in the deterministic portion of
utility (V) result in small changes in the limits of
integration and small changes in the resulting choice
probabilities. Moreover, unique values of the deterministic portion exist that maximize the probability of
the observed choices. The regularity of the likelihood
surface allows use of gradient-based methods (e.g.,
Newton-Raphson) to solve for values of the deterministic portion (V) that maximize the likelihood.
The presence of choice sets destroys the regularity of the likelihood function. As choice alternatives
enter and leave the set, the choice probabilities are
obtained by integrating over an error space of changing support. Adding an alternative (k) to the choice
set results in an additional factor in Equation (5),
with an additional stochastic error (Ek) and appropriate limits of integration. The likelihood surface for a
choice-set model is therefore discontinuous and not
necessarily globally concave.
Researchers have dealt with the nonregularity of
the likelihood surface by writing the probability as
the product of a (conditional) second-stage probability and a marginal choice-set probability:
Pr(i, C) = Pr(i I C) x Pr(C),

(7)

where C denotes the choice set that reduces the
number of alternatives in Equation (5). The likelihood function is "smoothed out" by summing over
choice sets:
Pr(i) = y

Pr(i I C) x Pr(C).

(8)

c

This approach, coupled with the assumption that the
values of the deterministic components {Vi} are constant across the choice sets, results in a smooth and
globally concave likelihood surface.
The estimation of choice-set models using Equation (8) has historically been approached sequentially, sometimes with independent data. Jedidi et al.
(1996) and Roberts and Lattin (1991) have respondents indicate the acceptability of alternatives in a
survey. Ben-Akiva and Boccara (1995) also use survey data and employ a logit model for the choice-set
probability. When independent data are available to
identify the acceptability of an offering, the evaluation
of choice-set models can employ standard maximumlikelihood techniques.
If independent data are not available to identify the
choice set, it becomes a latent construct that must be
simultaneously estimated with the observed choices.
Complications arise in the evaluation of the choice
probabilities because the partition of the error space
described in Equation (5) must also be partitioned
with respect to the choice set (see Mehta et al. 2003).

Only one realization of the error vector, e, is associated with each observation, and it is not appropriate to estimate the two components in Equation (7)
by assuming that each are associated with a different
realization.
An alternative to partitioning the error space is to
parameterize and estimate the point mass of each
choice set in Equation (8). Andrews and Srinivasan
(1995) use this approach on scanner panel data,
where the probability for each of the 2J - 1 possible choice sets is enumerated. Bronnenberg and
Vanhonacker (1996) propose a different likelihood
function where only J (one for each brand) additional
probabilities must be computed. Each of these models employs a compensatory function to determine
choice-set probability.
One method of dealing with the dimensionality of
the problem is to place a priori limits on the allowable choice sets. Fader and McAlister (1990) assume
the choice set is either the set of previously purchased
brands currently on promotion or all previously purchased brands, and they estimate the probability of
each being the actual choice set. Siddarth et al. (1995)
also restrict the number of choice sets to two: the
universal set or a subset of brands stochastically
determined based on past purchases.
Chiang et al. (1999) consider Equation (7) as a
hierarchical Bayes model, where the 21 - 1 sets are
assigned a prior distribution and posterior estimates
of set composition are obtained. While this approach
avoids the complications involved with identifying
suitable partitions of the error space to derive probabilities, the choice sets are not linked to the characteristics of the offerings other than through the fact
that the chosen brand is an element of the set. Choice
sets with high posterior probabilities comprise offerings that have been chosen and exclude offerings that
have not been chosen.
By contrast, our reduced-form model, Equation (1),
relies on screening rules and not on the enumeration of choice sets. The size of the universal set is
not a concern, nor is it necessary to specify a priori which attributes are being used to screen (e.g.,
price in Mehta et al. 2003 or promotion in Fader and
McAlister 1990) or place limits on the number of the
choice sets. Swait (2001) proposes a different reducedform model that is structurally a compensatory model
but mimics various decision rules depending on the
actual parameter estimates. A strength of Swait's
(2001) model is that it can be estimated using standard maximum-likelihood techniques. However, it
requires individuals to identify "unacceptable" levels
of attributes, and it cannot estimate the prevalence of
screening in the sample.
Our model structure allows for screening alternatives based on the attribute levels and/or the

overall value of the offering. Attribute level screening can employ either conjunctive or disjunctive
rules. We navigate the complicated partitioning of
the error space by employing data augmentation and
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC). We
next describe the use of data augmentation to evaluate the standard probit model in Equation (5) above.
We then show how this method can be used to estimate choice models with screening rules.

Application to Choice Models with
Screening Rules
If an alternative is in the choice set, then its choice
probability is determined relative to the other offerings in the set. If an alternative does not satisfy the
screening rule, then its choice probability is zero. The
choice model can be written hierarchically as
y z,I(x, y),

(12a)

Data Augmentation
Direct evaluation of the probability in Equation (5)
can be avoided in a Bayesian approach to estimation
if the parameters {V } are augmented with a vector of
latent variables, z (see Tanner and Wong 1987), where

z IV,

(12b)

zi = Vi + Ei,

Ei ~ Normal(0,

1),

(9)

and the model is written hierarchically:

y iz,

(10a)

z iV,
(10b)
where y denotes the observed choice outcomes. Equation (10a) reflects the censoring of the continuous
variables z, where only the offering with the maximum value of z is revealed to the researcher by the
choice data. Equation (10b) reflects the assumption
that the latent variables are normally distributed, with
the mean of each element equal to Vi and variance
one. In marketing applications of the probit model,
the mean is typically parameterized Vi = x,3P.Markov
chain Monte Carlo estimation of the probit model proceeds by drawing iteratively from the two conditional
distributions:

w(z Iy, V) = TruncatedNormal(V, I1),
IT(VIz) = Normal(z, 1/n),

(11a)
(11b)

where "IL" is the identity matrix, and the truncation in Equation (11a) corresponds to the alternative
selected being the maximum draw. If Vi is parameterized as x'I3, then the mean and variance in Equation (11b) would correspond to the OLS regression
estimate and covariance matrix. Detailed treatments
of estimating the probit model with data augmentation can be found in Albert and Chib (1993), McCulloch and Rossi (1994), Allenby and Rossi (1999), and
Edwards and Allenby (2003).
The upper limits of the integral in Equation (5)
that complicate the evaluation of the choice probability are replaced with a much simpler procedure
that involves drawing from a truncated normal distribution. The truncation points correspond to the
limits of integration, and the Markov chain is used
to navigate the domain of the error space consistent with the observed data to arrive at the posterior distribution of model parameters. Thus, data
augmentation provides a clever way of avoiding the
estimation of the integral.

where zi = Vi + Ei, and estimation proceeds by drawing iteratively from the conditional distributions:
z y, V, I(x, y),

(13a)

y y, z, x,

(13b)

V z.

(13c)

The conditional distribution in Equation (13a) is a
truncated normal distribution for those items in the
choice set. That is, the element of z for the chosen
alternative is greater than the elements of z that correspond to the alternatives not chosen, given that
they are in the choice set. If an alternative is not in
the choice set, which is determined by the indicator function I(x, y), then z is drawn from a nontruncated distribution. Here we assume that I(x, y) does
not involve the deterministic component of utility, V;
changes to the hierarchy to accommodate this screening rule are discussed below.
The conditional distribution for the cutoff parameters, y, in Equation (13b) is dependent on the
observed data, y, and the augmented parameter, z.
The conditional distribution takes the form of an
indicator function because Equation (12a) is a deterministic function that censors the continuous latent
variables z, identifying the considered offering with
the highest value. Variation in the value of the cutoff
parameter changes the set of considered alternatives.
Permissible values of the cutoff parameters are those
that lead to a choice set where the maximum of the
augmented variable, z, corresponds to the observed
choice. If a value of the cutoff leads to a choice set
where the alternative with the maximum z is not the
alternative chosen, then the cutoff parameter is not
permissible. This can happen because some values
of the augmented parameter in Equation (13a) are
drawn from a truncated distribution while others are
not. Variation in z results in different choice sets by
defining the permissible values of the cutoffs.
Finally, the conditional distribution in Equation (13c) is identical to Equation (11b). Standard normal distribution theory can be used to generate the
draw of V. If V is parameterized as a regression function, V = Xp8, then draws of p are generated from a

normal distribution with mean and covariance matrix
corresponding to the standard OLS model. Details
of the estimation routine for our empirical study,
reported below, are provided in the appendix.
The Markov chain defined by Equations (13a)(13c) generates draws from the full conditional distribution of model parameters despite the irregularity
of the likelihood surface. Given the cutoffs, y, the
model (Equation (1)) becomes a standard discretechoice model. Given the set of augmented variables,
{z), some values of the cutoff are acceptable and others are not. Across multiple draws of the augmented
variables, however, the acceptable range of y varies,
and the Markov chain converges in distribution to the
full conditional distribution of all model parameters.
The augmented variable z reflects a single error term
that gives rise to the joint probability of the consideration set and the resulting choice.
Recall that our model does not rely on process data
or respondents indicating which alternatives or which
attribute levels are acceptable. Intuitively, the logic for
identifying acceptable levels of the attributes relies
on the revealed choices. If a respondent chooses an
alternative, then the screening rule must be satisfied.
The presence of attributes that are common to more
than one choice alternative allows identification of
the cutoff parameter, y. Across all alternatives and
choice occasions, there is a set of zs, Vs, and ys that
are consistent with the revealed choices. We use the
Markov chain to explore the posterior distribution of
the allowable values of these parameters.
The compensatory decision rule requires a change
in the hierarchical model. Because the deterministic
portion of utility, V, is used to determine both the
choice set and the final choice, the hierarchy is

z jy, V, I(V,y),

(13a')

y Yy, z, V,

(13b')

V lz, y.

(13c')

The exact form of these conditional distributions
and the estimation algorithm is contained in the
Appendix.
In addition to the form of the screening rule,
researchers can specify that the cutoff parameters (y)
take on a limited range of values. If an attribute, x, is
continuous (e.g., price), then y can also be continuous.
However, if the attribute takes on a restricted number
of values, then the cutoff is not well identified over an
unrestricted range. In a conjoint analysis, for example,
there are rarely more than four or five levels of an
attribute. In these cases one can assume that the cutoff
parameter takes on a small number of finite values by
a prior assumption that y is distributed multinomial
over a grid of value and estimate the posterior distribution of the multinomial mass probabilities. Next,

we explain this approach in the context of our empirical application.

Data and Models

The screening rule model is illustrated in the context
of a discrete-choice conjoint study of consumer preferences for the features of a new camera format, the
advanced photo system (APS). This photographic system offers several potential advantages over standard
35-mm film systems, including midroll film change,
camera operation feedback, and a magnetic layer on
the film that offers the ability to annotate the picture
with titles and dates. These data have previously been
described in Allenby et al. (2002).
Respondents were screened and recruited by telephone and interviewed at field locations in nine
metropolitan areas. A total of 302 respondents participated. The screen was designed to exclude individuals who had little or no interest in photography, and
retained approximately 55% of the population contacted. This compares to approximately 67% of the
population that owns still cameras (Simmons 1997).
Individuals participating in the study were therefore
assumed to be good prospects for cameras in the price
range of the new APS offerings and representative of
the APS camera market.
Respondents were asked to evaluate 14 buying
scenarios. The order of the buying scenarios was
randomized. Each scenario contained full profile
descriptions of three compact 35-mm cameras, three
new APS cameras, and a seventh no-buy option.
Table 1 lists the attributes that describe each of the
cameras and identifies the attributes that are new and
specific to APS cameras. The order of the attributes
was the same in each scenario. Table 1 also displays
restrictions on the availability of certain attributes. For
example, the 4x zoom lens was available only on the
"high" body style. Prices ranged from $41 to $499,
the average price for APS cameras was $247, and the
average price of the compact 35-mm cameras was

$185.

Each buying scenario requires the respondent to
engage in a complex decision. With six offerings
described on eight attributes, plus the no-buy option,
we consider this to be a good dataset with which
to investigate the use of screening rules. The no-buy
option was selected 14.7% of the time or an average
of 2.1 times in the 14 choice tasks. One of the APS
camera offerings was chosen 39.9% of the time, and
one of the 35-mm cameras was selected 45.4% of the
time. In the analysis that follows, 12 choice tasks per

That is, the selected alternative has greatest utility of
the options for which Vhik> Yh:

where Xhikm is the level of the attribute for respondent h in buying scenario i for alternative k and
attribute m. Yhmis a respondent-level parameter representing the threshold, or acceptable level, of attribute
m for respondent h. We employ two alternative heterogeneity distributions for the threshold parameters.
When attribute m is continuously distributed (e.g.,
price), then we employ a normal distribution to allow
for heterogeneity:
-

Yhm Normal(jm, oe).

(20)

When an attribute takes on a small number of discrete
levels, we assume that the threshold parameter is distributed multinomial. For example, consider the zoom
lens attribute in Table 1 taking on values of none, 2x,
and 4 x. We recode the attribute levels (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
and specify a grid of possible cutoffs (e.g., -0.5, 0.5,
1.5, 2.5), where the lowest cutoff value indicates that
all attribute levels are acceptable, and the highest level
indicates that none of the levels is acceptable. For nominally scaled attribute levels where a prior ordering
is not obvious (e.g., color), the grid has three points
(-0.5, 0.5, 1.5). The full set of attributes, levels, and
cutoffs is contained in Table 5. The distribution of heterogeneity of the cutoff parameters with discrete levels
is
(21)
yhm Multinomial(Om),
where Omis the vector of multinomial probabilities
associated with the grid for attribute m.
The fourth model assumes that the choice set is
formed using a disjunctive decision rule:
Pr(j)hi = Pr(zhij >

hik for

all k such that

> Yhm) >1).
EmmI(Xhikm

(22)

The upper and lower grid points specify the role of
the attribute in determining the choice set, depending on the decision rule. An attribute determines
membership in the choice set only if it changes the
value of the alternative indicator function. For the
conjunctive model, if the threshold for attribute k is
equal to -0.5, then I(Xhijk> Yhk) always equals one
and the value of ImI(Xhijm > Yhm)does not change.
Because different levels of the attribute do not affect
choice sets, we conclude that attribute k is not being
used to screen alternatives. For the disjunctive model,
if Yhk = 2.5, then I(Xhijk > Yhk) always equals zero,
and the value of EmI(Xhijm > Yhm) does not change
across different levels of attribute k. For the disjunctive model, the upper value of the threshold implies
no screening based on that attribute. Figure 1 illustrates the procedure and the interpretation.
The fifth model assumes that consumers are either
using a conjunctive (Equation (19)) or a disjunctive
(Equation (22)) screening rule. That is, we allow for

the presence of structural heterogeneity (Yang and
Allenby 2000):
Pr(j)hi-

where 4 is the portion of the sample using the conjunctive decision rule and (1 - 0) is the portion using
the disjunctive decision rule. A concise listing of the
models is provided in Table 2.
Inference is conducted via Bayesian MCMC methods. The chain converged quickly in all models. Convergence was assessed by inspecting time-series plots
from multiple starting points. The chain was run for
10,000 iterations, with the final 5,000 iterations used to
estimate the moments of the posterior distributions.
Details of the estimation algorithms for all models are
provided in the Appendix.

Results

The results indicate that the conjunctive model fits
the data best. In-sample and predictive fits of the five
models are presented in Table 2. The log marginal
density is computed using the GHK estimator (Keane
1994, Hajivassilious et al. 1996) and the importance
sampling method of Newton and Raftery (1994). Hit
probability is defined as the average probability associated with the observed choices. Hit frequency is
the number of times the predicted choice matches the
actual choice. The parameters reported below for the
conjunctive model result in 30% of the alternatives
screened out of the final choice set, which averaged
five (out of seven) alternatives, including the no-buy
option.
Fit results for the other models are as follows. The
fit for the disjunctive model is slightly worse than the
standard probit model, with parameters that lead to
only 2% of the alternatives screened from final consideration. The slight decrease in the log marginal density for the disjunctive model is from the increase in
the dimension of the model due to the cutoff parameters. Although the compensatory model screened out
23% of the alternatives to form the choice set and
has a slightly better in-sample fit than the probit
model, its predictive accuracy is nearly identical. The
structural heterogeneity model assigned nearly all the
respondents (99%) to the conjunctive screening rule
model as opposed to the disjunctive model, so the
fit statistics closely match those of the conjunctive
model.
The results provide evidence that the conjunctive
model is superior to both the standard probit and

nonconjunctive models. The conjunctive model has
the largest value of the log marginal density. Despite
the addition of 11 cutoff parameters per respondent, the conjunctive model performs as well as or
better than more parsimonious models in the hold-out
sample. This establishes the predictive validity of the
choice model with a conjunctive screening rule.
Tables 3 and 4 report part-worth estimates for the
probit and conjunctive models. Table 3 displays the
mean and covariance matrix of the part-worths for
the probit model, and Table 4 reports the same statistics for the conjunctive model. Substantive differences
exist in the part-worth estimates for body style, zoom,
camera setting feedback, and price. The conjunctive
model estimates are much smaller for these attributes,
with the average price coefficient moving to zero. The
reason for this difference is discussed below.
The cutoff parameters are reported in Table 5. For
discrete attributes, the cutoffs are reported in terms of
multinomial point mass probabilities associated with
the grid described in Figure 1. The probabilities indicate the fraction of respondents with a cutoff parameter (y) that screens out choice alternatives. For the
conjunctive model, 01 = 0.598 indicates that 59.8% of

the respondents are not screening alternatives based
on "Body Style," 02 = 0.324 implies that 32.4% of
the respondents screen out offerings with the low
body style, 03 = 0.059 implies that 5.9% of the respondents screen out offerings with low and medium body
style, and 64 = 0.015 implies that 1.5% of the respondents screen on all alternative levels. Estimates of 0
equal to approximately 2% reflect the influence of the
prior distribution and can be disregarded for practical
purposes.
The use of screening rules to form choice sets is pervasive among the respondents in this research. Analysis of the individual-level cutoff values indicates
that 92% of respondents form choice sets using the
conjunctive screening rule; 58% are forming choice
sets based on a single attribute, 33% are using
two attributes, and 2% are using three attributes.
A strength of the Bayesian approach outlined in
this paper is the ability to make individual-level
inferences and estimate not only what attributes are
important in forming choice sets, but also who is
using screening rules.
Consider, for example, an aggregate analysis of the
effect of the price threshold, estimated to be equal to

-6.269. This corresponds to an average price threshold of $527. Because the maximum price of an APS
camera is $499, this implies that, on average, respondents are not screening on price. However, such analysis masks the tail behavior of the distribution of
cutoff values. As displayed in Figure 2, 10% of the
respondents will only consider cameras under $276,
20% will only consider cameras under $356, etc. In
all, 41% of the respondents are screening alternatives
based on price.
Figure 3 displays the proportion of respondents
screening on each of the attributes. Body style,
zoom, camera settings feedback, and price are the
attributes most often used to screen alternatives.
These attributes are available on both 35-mm and
APS cameras, and as a result respondents are more
fully aware of their benefits. In contrast, none of the
new APS attributes (e.g., midroll film change) is being
used to screen alternatives. In addition, the attributes
used to form choice sets have substantively different part-worths in Tables 3 and 4. Our results indi-

cate that once the choice set is formed, the price and
body style do not play a role in the final decision.
The zoom and camera feedback features, however,
continue to play a role in the final selection of a
camera beyond just screening. Previous authors have
hypothesized that an attribute plays either a role in
the screening phase or the choice phase (Bronnenberg
and Vanhonacker 1996) or that once an attribute is
deemed acceptable it will play no role in the final
selection process (see Bettman 1979); these results provide evidence on this issue.
The participants in the survey were recruited and
qualified by industry standards so that they were a
prospect for cameras in the price range of the APS
offering. Despite this prequalification, some 41% of
respondents used price to screen alternatives and
excluded those cameras above a particular threshold. Exploratory analysis revealed no relationship
between the posterior estimate of the price threshold
value and demographic variables, including income.
However, replies to the question "Typically, when

of respondents) have an average price threshold $68
higher than respondents who take their camera less
frequently. Although exploratory in nature, this analysis shows that other variables correlate with the price
threshold and may be used in conjunction with the
model to better identify prospects in the marketplace.
The empirical results support the conjunctive
screening rule model. Better in-sample and out-ofsample fit, despite the large increase in the number of parameters, argue for the use of the screening
rule model over the more parsimonious probit. Consumers tend to screen alternatives using attributes
they are already familiar with, and an exploratory
analysis was conducted to demonstrate how the price
threshold can be associated with other variables in a
posterior analysis. After controlling for their effect in

forming choice sets, the importance of the screening
attributes in the final choice among acceptable alternatives is smaller than that indicated by a standard
probit model.

Discussion

In this paper we have proposed a model to deal
with an inherently discontinuous model of consumer behavior: two-stage decision making. Our
reduced-form model incorporates screening rules that
are consistent with various consideration set and
information-processing theories of consumer behavior. We find support for the use of screening rules and
for the conjunctive model in particular. The use of
screening rules is pervasive, with 92% of respondents
using this heuristic to manage the complexity of the
choice problem. The empirical results also show that
consumers screen alternatives using attributes that
are well known, as opposed to the new and novel
attributes also included in this study. Some attributes

appear to be used only in forming choice sets, while
others are used in both screening and final product
choice. Although previous research has documented
the improved fit of choice-set models and statistical
biases that result from ignoring them, our method can
apply a variety of screening rules and handle realistically sized problems. Our ability to capture a noncompensatory screening process and make attributelevel inferences for individuals is due to the unique
model formulation and estimation technique.
A key element in our model is accurately navigating the likelihood of the data where only the final
choice is observed. Past researchers have attempted

to isolate the consideration-set probability Pr(C) in
Equation (7) to create a smooth likelihood surface.
This approach requires a complex partition of the
error space corresponding to the 21 - 1 consideration
sets and the choice probability within each set (see
Mehta et al. 2003). Alternatively, the consideration-set
probability can be estimated by treating each of the
21 - 1 partitions as a model parameter (see Chiang
et al. 1999). By parameterizing the screening rules,
using data augmentation to accurately partition the
error space, and using the Markov chain to navigate
the posterior distribution of all parameters, we can
estimate a model that has a discontinuous likelihood
function.
This research highlights the benefits and the
potential of research on extended models of choice
(Ben-Akiva et al. 1999). In this research we have
demonstrated that the data are consistent with a twostage decision process utilizing decision heuristics
to form choice sets. In an exploratory analysis we
show that the level of the price threshold was related
to a camera usage question thought to encompass
varying concerns and interests related to pursuing
photography. It may very well be that the use of any
decision heuristic, which decision heuristic (conjunctive or disjunctive), and/or which attributes to screen
are also related to individual concerns and interests
that may vary within an individual across usage occasions or choice contexts. For example, choosing a cam-

The method proposed in this paper can be used to
test various discontinuous decision-making processes
using revealed choice data.
The current study contains several limitations. As
noted earlier, the compensatory model requires the
deterministic component of utility to be the same in
the screening rule and in the compensatory part of
the model. More flexible representations that allow
for a "screening utility" and a "choice utility" may fit
the data better. Our empirical application may also be
more prone to identifying screening rules than actual
market situations. The large number of choice scenarios (14), the consistency of the universal set (six alternatives plus "none"), and the size of the universal set
may all contribute to the adoption of screening rules
by respondents. In these data, there was very little
evidence that consumers used a disjunctive screening
rule. It may be that more than 12 observations per
individual are necessary to identify the parameters in
this very flexible model.
The methodology presented in this paper can be
extended. Attribute-level thresholds or the propensity to use one decision process over another in the

structural heterogeneity model can be parameterized
as functions of explanatory variables. The Bayesian
hierarchical model would then be expanded by
another level. The conjoint exercise used in this paper
involved six alternatives described on eight attributes,
plus a "none" option. Conjoint researchers may be
interested to know if the number of alternatives or
attributes influences respondents' use of a screening rule; this question can be studied using the
proposed model and an experimental design that
varies the number of attributes and alternatives. The
model can also be applied to scanner panel datasets
or any other panel dataset that captures repeated
purchase behavior and identifies common attributes
with unique levels. Such a study would reveal the
importance of individual attributes and/or the use of
screening rules in an actual market setting.
Managers frequently define markets based on particular attributes (e.g., body style) or price points,
recognizing that certain consumers will only consider offerings with specific attribute levels, regardless
of other elements of the product offering. Past methods of identifying these attributes and levels have
tended to rely on compensatory models that may not
be good representations of the decision process. While
compensatory models can often predict as well as
nonlinear models, inferences for strategic decisions
are often biased. Our model overcomes the statistical

Estimation Algorithm

Equations (13a)-(13c) list the conditional distributions for
estimating the choice model in (12a)-(12b). The estimation for the conjunctive screening process, Equation (3), is
described first. Extension to the disjunctive process, Equation (4), is straightforward. Changes necessary to estimate
the compensatory process, Equations (2) and (13a')-(13c'),
are then described. The standard hierarchical Bayes probit
model (Rossi et al. 1996) and structural heterogeneity models (Yang and Allenby 2000) have been described elsewhere.
The augmented data problem for the conjunctive model is

2a. Generate YhI Zh, Yh,Xh,13hfor h = 1, ..., H.
Again, conditioned on the current values of Zh and Ph
and the observed data, the key is to draw yh from the set
of allowable values. The allowable values of yh define consideration sets such that the chosen alternative always has
the maximum value of z.
If Yhij= 1, then Xhij]h > Yh;
let B* = min(x'hijfh for all i and j, where
Yhij= ).
If Yhij=0 and Zhij> Zhik, where Yhik= 1, then xijh < h;
=0
let A* =
for all i and j with
max(x'hij;1h
Yhij
and Zhij > Zhik, where Yhik= 1).

Then A* <Y h < B* defines the allowable range for Yh. A*
requires that all chosen alternatives be part of the consideration set. B* requires that any alternative that is not chosen
but has a value of z greater than the chosen alternative, be
excluded from the consideration set.
Following Chib and Greenberg (1995), we perform a
Metropolis-Hastings step by drawing Yh directly from the
allowable range of the prior; in our case the prior is the
heterogeneity distribution and we draw from the truncated
normal distribution:
