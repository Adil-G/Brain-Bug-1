Entrepreneurial Behavior: Firm Organizing
Processes
William B. Gartner, Nancy M. Carter, and Paul D. Reynolds

Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to offer some ideas and evidence about the processes of organization formation. We look at the founding of independent for-profit
businesses for insights into the nature of organization formation, in general, realizing that other kinds of organizations, such as voluntary organizations, non-profit
organizations, and governmental organizations, may be founded in different ways
(Aldrich & Reuf, 2006; Gartner, 1993; Gartner & Gatewood, 1993; Scott, 1997).
The focus of research on entrepreneurial behavior is about exploring “how” various activities undertaken by individuals emerge into organizations. Entrepreneurial
behavior is a type of organizational behavior (Bird, 1989). Entrepreneurial behavior
involves the activities of individuals who are associated with creating new organizations rather than the activities of individuals who are involved with maintaining
or changing the operations of on-going established organizations (Gartner et al.,
1992; Gartner & Starr, 1993). This chapter does not attempt to investigate the
factors and causes that might lead to the initiation of organization formation activities. Discussions of theory and evidence about “why” organizations are likely to
be formed have been addressed by a number of scholars (Aldrich & Reuf, 2006;
Kirchhoff, 1994; Reynolds, 1992; Reynolds & White, 1997; Reynolds et al., 2000;
Schoonhoven & Romanelli, 2001; Storey, 1994), and were also the subject of two
special issues of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice (1992, 1993).
We view entrepreneurship as an organizational phenomenon, and more specifically, as an organizing process. Without belaboring the etymology of the word
“entrepreneurship,” [see, for example, Baumol (1993), Bull and Willard (1993),
and Herbert and Link (1988), for discussions of a history of entrepreneurship definitions; and Amit, Glosten and Muller (1993) and Gartner (1990, 1993, 2001) for

recent interpretations], its root, entreprendre [i.e., go ahead, take in hand, undertake, take a hold of (Crookall, 1994, 333)] is fundamentally about organizing [as in
a “generic category of assembly rules,” (Weick, 1979, 235)]. Organizing involves
the coordination and establishment of routines, structures, and systems (Becker &
Gordon, 1966; Nelson & Winter, 1982; Ronen, 1982). Organizing processes are
accomplished through interactions among people, continually re-accomplished and
renewed over time (Pfeffer, 1982). We posit that the roots of entrepreneurship are,
therefore, embedded in social processes (Katz, 1993; Katz & Gartner, 1988) and
we consider the processes of organization formation to be the core characteristic of
entrepreneurship (Carter et al., 1996; Gartner, 1985, 1988, 2001).
Parts of this chapter are devoted to defining the scope and boundaries of
entrepreneurial behavior, as a topic area in the field of entrepreneurship. In the next
section of this we attempt to alert the reader to what we consider to be some of the
primary characteristics of the phenomenon of entrepreneurial behavior. We believe
that entrepreneurial behavior is an individual-level phenomenon, which occurs over
time (is a process), and results in an organization as the primary outcome of these
activities. We then identify an issue that we believe has caused considerable confusion in the entrepreneurship field: namely the assumption that the study of new
organizations is comparable to the study of emerging organizations. We argue that
the information gained from the retrospections, insights, or the current behaviors
and thought processes of individuals who are operating established new businesses
are not comparable to the experiences of individuals actually in the process of organization creation. Research on individuals already in business tells only one side of
the story about the process of organization creation—about outcomes of emergence.
We will argue that research based on samples of individuals in new firms are biased
in a way that renders them unusable for answering fundamental questions about how
entrepreneurs create organizations. If the reader accepts our point of view about the
need to use samples of individuals in the process of starting businesses for research
on organization formation, then, prior empirical research that is germane to this
literature review dramatically decreases.
The third part of this chapter specifies the outcomes of entrepreneurial behavior:
the characteristics of new organizations. We believe the reader gains some important
insights into the process of entrepreneurial behavior through this exploration of the
kinds of organizational characteristics that can be used to manifest a “new organization.” It is not apparently easy to specify the characteristics of a new organization,
and since (as will be shown) new organizations manifest themselves, over time, in
various ways, appreciating the variety of characteristics that constitute the existence
of a new organization suggests the variety of behaviors that might lead to generating
these characteristics.
The fourth section of this chapter offer ideas and empirical evidence about
whether specific entrepreneurs influence the likelihood of success in creating new
organizations and insights into the overall “gestalt” of entrepreneurial activities and
possible ways these sequences of activities might be combined in order for an organization to emerge. We identify a growing number of empirical studies that focus on
the activities of individuals involved in founding organizations. In the fifth section,

we suggest a few possible ways that research on entrepreneurial behavior might
be approached. Finally, the chapter ends with some recommendations for future
research in this area.

Characteristics of Entrepreneurial Behavior
There are a number of assumptions that influence this overview of research on
entrepreneurial behavior that differs dramatically with assumptions that guide
the work of other scholars who focus on other aspects of organization creation.
First, the process of creating a new organization is, inherently, an individuallevel phenomenon. Individual behaviors are the principal necessary ingredients
for organization formation to occur. Without the organization creation activities
of individuals, there are no organizations. So, while organization formation occurs
within a particular context (Aldrich & Ruef, 2006; Gartner, 1985; Schoonhoven &
Romanelli, 2001)—environmental, economic, social, community, political—
organizations are not created by their context. Entrepreneurs are necessary for
entrepreneurial behavior, and it is through the actions of entrepreneurs that organizations come into existence. We see entrepreneurial behavior as something that
individuals engage in, rather than firms (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). We are not
suggesting that entrepreneurs, as firm organizers, are inherently unique, per se,
compared to individuals undertaking other kinds of activities. Rather, we stipulate that organization formation requires activity, and that activity occurs through
the actions of individuals. From the entrepreneurial behavior perspective, it is the
behaviors that matter (as the primary way in which variation among individuals would be ascertained) not the characteristics of these individuals, themselves
(Gartner, 1988). This perspective assumes that there are individual differences both
between new firm founders (nascent entrepreneurs) compared to non-founders and
among firm founders, themselves. The study of individual differences are of interest in ascertaining those factors that might prompt some individuals to engage in
firm formation activities (compared to others), as well as specifying why nascent
entrepreneurs engage in different entrepreneurial activities. Individual characteristics matter, therefore, in that they are likely to be associated with differences
in individual behaviors. But, it is the behaviors, themselves, that produce organizations. It should also be pointed out that the behaviors involved in organization
formation are likely to be imbedded in the actions of many individuals, rather than
through a single individual. A significant percentage of firm formation activities
involve teams of individuals (Ruef et al., 2003). Therefore, it would be the behaviors of all individuals involved in the formation of a firm that would comprise the
process of organization creation.
Second, entrepreneurial behavior is a process. When we discuss the activities
of individuals engaged in entrepreneurial activities, we hope the reader realizes that
these activities occur over a period of time. While the ways in which we observe and
report on entrepreneurial activities might lead one to think that these activities are

<-----Page 3----->102

W.B. Gartner et al.

concrete and limited events, we recognize that most entrepreneurial activity requires
a set of actions or series of actions, over time.
Third, the creation of an organization is the principal outcome of entrepreneurial
behavior, that is, our primary dependent variable for research on entrepreneurial
behavior is determining whether an organization comes into existence, or not. While
a number of other outcomes of entrepreneurial activity might occur in the organization formation process (e.g., the creation of new products, the identification
of new markets, new customers and groups of customers, the acquisition of new
skills and knowledge) the fundamental outcome of entrepreneurial behavior is the
organization, itself. We are cognizant that there are numerous quantitative and qualitative differences in the kinds of organizations that are created. Such organizational
characteristics as size (in sales and employees), rate of growth, profitability, and
innovativeness are certainly important to recognize when making judgments about
the subsequent value of the outcomes of entrepreneurial behavior.
Finally, we note that the process of entrepreneurial behavior is a multi-level phenomenon and that it is often difficult to separate what constitutes an independent
variable (an entrepreneurial activity) from a dependent variable (a characteristic of
a new organization). For example, the activity of “making sales” is both an important individual-level entrepreneurial behavior and an important characteristic that
indicates that an organization exists. An individual is actually involved in creating
a sales transaction, that is, an organization cannot actually sell: an individual must
undertake those activities. Yet, “making sales” is a critical signifier of an important
organizational characteristic (Brush et al., 2008; Katz & Gartner, 1988; Kim, 2006;
Reynolds & Miller, 1992). Is “making sales” an individual-level or an organizationlevel phenomenon? It is difficult to keep separate what appear to be individual-level
activities and events from what essentially is something that is, or becomes, the organization, itself. This problem is omnipresent in research on entrepreneurial behavior:
at some point individual entrepreneurial activity emerges into organizational behavior. Demarcating when this transition actually occurs is surprisingly difficult to do
(Kim, 2006; Reynolds & Miller, 1992).
Much of our discussion about the current state of knowledge on the topic of entrepreneurial behavior and possible directions for future research on entrepreneurial
behavior is informed by our insights and experiences with developing the Panel
Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics—PSED I (Gartner et al., 2004; Reynolds,
2000, 2007; Shaver et al., 2001) and PSED II (Reynolds & Curtin, 2008). PSED
I is detailed longitudinal survey information on 830 individuals that were identified while they were in the process of starting new businesses (from 1998 to 2002
depending on when they were contacted). This sample of nascent entrepreneurs
was generated from a random sample of 64,622 working age adults in the United
States. PSED II began in 2005 with the selection of a cohort of 1,214 nascent
entrepreneurs chosen from a representative sample of 31,845 adults. Both PSED
I and II are representative, generalizable samples of all entrepreneurial activity in
the United States. There are now, also, other national PSED-like generalizeable
surveys of nascent entrepreneurs in other countries: Australia (Davidsson et al.,
2008a, 2008b), Canada (Diochon et al., 2005; Menzies et al., 2006), Germany

<-----Page 4----->5

(Brixy & Hessels, 2009). Latvia (Baltrušaitytė-Axelson et al., 2008), Netherlands
(Van Gelderen et al., 2006), Norway (Alsos & Kolvereid, 1998; Alsos &
Ljunggren, 1998; Rotefoss & Kolvereid, 2005), and Sweden (Delmar & Davidsson,
2000).
PSED I and II are among the very few national databases to offer systematic,
reliable, and generalizable data on the process of business formation. Other national
studies of the process of business formation similar to the PSED efforts have also
occurred in Australia, Sweden, and Norway. The PSED includes information on: the
proportion and characteristics of the adult population involved in attempts to start
new businesses, the kinds of activities these nascent entrepreneurs undertake during
the business startup process, and the proportion and characteristics of the startup
efforts that become new firms. As will be described in later sections of this chapter,
research results from analyses of the PSED have generated significant insights into
the process of how firms emerge.

“New” Organizations Are Not “Emerging” Organizations
Before the existence of the PSED studies, there are very few “facts” about the process of organization formation as it actually occurs, and, a great deal of speculation.
Most studies of firm organizing activities have been retrospective explorations of
the startup behaviors of individuals who are already in business. This is a significant problem. As pointed out by other scholars, surveying only entrepreneurs
who have successfully started firms introduces significant selection bias into any
research program attempting to explore issues involved with the creation of organizations (Aldrich & Ruef, 2006; Aldrich et al., 1989; Delmar & Shane, 2003; Katz &
Gartner, 1988). Obviously, when only those individuals who have successfully
started businesses are surveyed, no information on startup activities is provided on
those individuals who failed in their startup attempts. Indeed, it is the knowledge
gained from studying the “failures” that provides reasonable contrasts for making
sense of the “successes.” Information gleaned from the individuals who successfully
started new businesses cannot be used to infer whether the unsuccessful nascent
entrepreneurs behaved differently. For example, if a survey of individuals who successfully started a new business indicates that 75% of these individuals initiated a
particular organization creation activity, this finding cannot be used to imply that
individuals who did not successfully start a new business did not undertake this
activity. It could be plausible that the same percentage of the unsuccessful nascent
entrepreneurs also initiated this same activity. It is very difficult to ascertain whether
a behavior undertaken by a successful entrepreneur, is indeed, important, without
information from the unsuccessful nascent entrepreneurs on whether they undertook
such behaviors, or not. If the outcome of entrepreneurial behavior is an organization, then, exploring the behaviors of entrepreneurs who all had successful outcomes
(new organizations) does not really seem to address the variation between those that
were successful and those that did not start organizations.

<-----Page 5----->104

W.B. Gartner et al.

Some scholars have assumed that the identification of all new organizations in
a particular population of organizations are likely to represent all of the variation
that occurred during prior attempts at founding, and that studies of new organizations would likely be an adequate surrogate for speculations about the creation of
variation in organization populations (Carroll & Hannan, 2000). We suggest that the
activities involved with attempts at creating organizations are likely to be where the
majority of possible variations, and sources of variations in possible new organizations are likely to occur (Aldrich & Ruef, 2006; Katz & Gartner, 1988). The process
of attempting to start businesses are experiments that are conducted by millions
of nascent entrepreneurs to test their hypotheses about whether their ideas, skills,
capabilities, and actions might result in successful outcomes (e.g., establishing an
on-going organization). It is in the process of organization formation that there are
likely to be more degrees of freedom to generate a variety of organizations and new
types of organizations. To assume that samples of individuals who had successful
solutions to the problem of organization creation represent all of the possible ways
that nascent entrepreneurs might have engaged in organization creation is a substantial leap of faith. We believe that scholarship on entrepreneurial behavior should be
based, primarily, on studies that observe individuals in the process of organization
creation.
Our inclination is to focus only on studies that have used samples of nascent
entrepreneurs, that is, to look at individuals in the process of starting businesses, and
to ignore evidence from studies that survey founders of new on-going organizations.
We try to point out, in our overview of research on entrepreneurial behaviors, on
the composition and characteristics of the individuals in the samples analyzed. We
believe that the evidence provided in the following sections of this chapter support
the view that research on organization formation processes needs to study these
activities while they occur. Samples used in research on organization creation need
to reflect all possible attempts at organization creation, not just those attempts that
resulted in new firms.

The Characteristics of Emerging Organizations
If entrepreneurial behavior involves creating organizations, then, an important
aspect of scholarly study of the organization creation process involves specifying,
what, exactly, is being created. Identifying when a new organization occurs, as well
as what constitutes a new organization, is a challenge. For example, one way to
measure the successful creation of a new business is whether a business license
exists. It is entirely possible for an individual to acquire a business license without an
idea about what the business is going to do, without any sales, without any specific
resources, and without a physical location. In fact, the first activity an entrepreneur
could engage in could be the acquisition of a business license. Is the possession of
a business license an organization? Should a business license, then, be the primary
measure of whether an organization has been created? Every measure that can be
used to indicate whether an organization exists has both benefits and problems.

There are numerous ways in which organizations can demonstrate their existence (Schoonhoven et al., 2009). In a review of theory and empirical research
on the characteristics of organizations in the process of creation, Katz and Gartner
(1988) suggested that there are four “properties” that could be used to identify their
emergence: intention (characteristics that demonstrate purpose and goals), resources
(physical components, such as human and financial capital), boundary (barrier conditions that distinguish the organization, as such—incorporation, phone listing, a tax
identification number), and exchange (transactions between the emerging organization and others, such as sales, loans, or investment). They indicated that an emerging
organization would “reveal” itself in different ways, and that a focus on any one of
these four properties would result in an observer noticing, at different times, the
newly created organization. As a way to explore the emergence of these four properties, we will first look at the problems involved in finding organizations that are
already in existence as a way to see whether these properties might be useful to
identifying organizations in the process of emergence.
Scholars who have attempted to find organizations (new and “old”) have found
that different data sources of organizations and different methods for finding organizations result in substantially different numbers and types of organizations identified
(Aldrich et al., 1989; Birley, 1984, 1986; Kalleberg et al., 1990; Busenitz & Murphy,
1996; Murphy, 2002). For example, Kalleberg et al. (1990) demonstrated that in a
comparison of five methods for identifying organizations in a specific geographical
area (enumeration—physically canvassing an area, telephone white pages, ES202—
state unemployment insurance files, DMI—Dun and Bradstreet Market Identifier
Files, and Chamber of Commerce listings), using telephone white pages revealed
the largest number of businesses (6,220) and using Chamber of Commerce listings revealed the least (1,131). Only 52.6% of the businesses identified by these
methods were listed in more than one data source, and only 5% of the businesses
identified were found in all five data sources. Other studies have found little overlap
among the businesses identified using different data sources, as well as indications
that each data source of organizations has certain inherent biases towards certain
kinds of organizations by type of industry, size, and ownership (Aldrich et al., 1989;
Birley, 1986; Busenitz & Murphy, 1996; Murphy, 2002). These studies implicitly
assume that organizations “exist” and that the only difficulty for scholars is in finding them. But, in fact, the measures used for identifying organizations “defines”
whether they actually “exist.” Recognizing that these studies were intended to find
organizations in existence, rather than organizations in the process of coming into
existence, suggests that the problem of identifying when an organization has been
created is likely to be even more difficult. We believe that there are a number of different “birthdays” for an emerging organization. These “birthdays” depend on the
measures used to indicate “birth.”
Some studies have attempted to trace the various properties of firm emergence
over time. Reynolds and Miller (1992) used samples derived from DMI files in
Minnesota and Pennsylvania to identify firm founders who were interviewed about
the occurrence (month and year) of four “gestation markers” in the creation of their
businesses: personal commitment (when members of the startup team first made an
investment of personal time and resources), financial support (when first outside

<-----Page 7----->106

W.B. Gartner et al.

financial support was obtained), sales (when first sales income received), and hiring
(when firm first hired anyone, full or part time). They found that
. . . none of these features of gestation in living systems are shared by new firms. Not all
events occur. Every possible sequence of events was present. There is substantial variation
in length of the gestation period. (Reynolds & Miller, 1992, 408)

Firms do not “signal” their emergence in the same way. About one-half of all of
the firms in their sample did not report all four events. When computing the time
between the first events reported and the last event reported (irregardless of how
many events were reported) they found that about 80% of all of the firms underwent the gestation process within 2 years. The first event for over 80% of new firms
is personal commitment. In addition, the first event for 40% of new firms is sales.
About half of all firms reported simultaneous first events of two or more activities. Last events reported ranged from 50% of firms indicating hiring employees
or receiving sales income, 40% of firms indicating receiving financial support, and
25% indicating personal commitment. After a number of analyses to explore various
sequences of startup events, Reynolds and Miller (1992) summarize their findings
by suggesting that
The most important implication is the importance of separating the founding process into
two parts. The gestation period, from conception to birth, should be treated separately from
the post-birth period. (p. 416)

In studies using the PSED I dataset, both Brush et al. (2008) and Kim (2006)
generated insights similar to Reynolds and Miller (1992) regarding patterns of emergence. Brush et al. (2008) found that all four properties identified in the Katz and
Gartner (1988) framework were necessary for firm survival in the short term, the

sequence in which these properties manifest themselves varied, and that the property
of intention did not necessarily precede the other three properties or increase the
likelihood of venture creation. Kim (2006) in an exploration of three emergent properties (goal orientation, boundedness, and interorganizational exchange) found that
the sequences in which these properties manifest themselves differed for various
industrial sectors.
In Table 5.1, we identify the items used in PSED I and II to determine the status
of an emerging organization. For PSED I, respondents provided their personal judgments about the status of the organizing effort. In PSED II, specific criteria were
used to infer that a new firm had been established. In both projects, the respondent
provided a determination of when the respondent stopped engaging in the startup
process.

Entrepreneurial Behaviors: Firm Formation Activities
A number of scholars have suggested a variety of activities that are necessary for
organization creation, as well as an explicit, or sometimes implied sequence of
how these activities will occur. For example, Gartner and Starr (1993) identified 24
different lists of entrepreneurial activities taken from various scholarly books and
articles when they attempted to generate a comprehensive list of entrepreneurial
behaviors and sequences of entrepreneurial behaviors. It should be noted that most
of these lists of activities were based on anecdotal evidence, rather than on systematic research studies. Gartner and Starr (1993) indicated that the predominant
way in which entrepreneurial activity was construed involved viewing the process of organization creation in a mechanistic way (Morgan, 1996), that is, seeing
entrepreneurial activity as a set of behaviors involved with assembling various
resources that can ultimately be combined into an organization. Van de Ven et al.
(1989) describe this process of assembly as an accumulation or epigenetic model
of change: “Over time, these entrepreneurs accumulate the external resources and
technology necessary to transform their ideas into a concrete reality by constructing
a new business unit” (p. 225). For example, Vesper (1990, 109) specifies that the
process of organization creation involves the acquisition of five key ingredients: (1)
technical know-how to generate the company’s product or service, (2) the product
or service idea which provides direction for the organization’s efforts, (3) personal
contacts, “because ventures are not started in isolation,” (4) physical resources, and
(5) customer orders. He then presents anecdotal evidence to indicate that these five
key ingredients can be combined in a variety of differences sequences (e.g., 1-2-34-5, 4-1-5-2-3, 5-3-1-4-2, etc.). As was shown earlier in the Reynolds and Miller
(1992) study, Vesper’s suggestion that the sequence of startup activities may not
follow, what appears to be a logical progression (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5), seems to have systematic empirical support. Yet, most lists of entrepreneurial activities do suggest a
particular sequence of activities, such as Birley (1984) who assumes that the venture
creation process will occur in the following order: (1) decision to start a business,

<-----Page 9----->108

W.B. Gartner et al.

(2) quit job, (3) incorporate, (4) establish bank account, (5) acquire premises and
equipment, (6) receive first order, (7) pay first tax, (9) hire full-time employees.
Since the Gartner and Starr (1993) overview of entrepreneurial behavior research,
there have been a number of systematic empirical studies of how entrepreneurial
activities might lead to the formation of an organization. The empirical studies that
have explored a comprehensive view of the constellation of activities that might
result in organization formation can be identified as those involved with in-depth
event histories of a few organizations created while studying the innovation process (Garud & Van de Ven, 1992; Van de Ven & Polley, 1992; Van de Ven et al.,
1989; Venkataraman & Van de Ven, 1989) and studies that have explored whether a
specified list of entrepreneurial activities are involved in creating a broad range of
different types of firms (Carter et al., 1996; Gatewood et al., 1995; Lichtenstein
et al., 2007; Reynolds, 2007; Reynolds & Curtin, 2008). There have also been
numerous studies that have focused on specific behaviors (such as business planning), or sets of behaviors, and the influence of these specific behaviors on success
at starting a business (e.g., Delmar & Shane, 2003; Honig & Karlsson, 2004; Liao &
Gartner, 2006; Shane and Delmar, 2004). A discussion of the findings of these
studies will be discussed in the following section.
Since Van de Ven and his colleagues have primarily focused on the nature of
innovation within established organizations as a way to understand entrepreneurial
behavior, and since their line of research has been discussed, in detail, elsewhere
(Poole et al., 2000), we will summarize their efforts by suggesting that their findings
indicate a multitude of different entrepreneurial activities and a variety of sequences
of these activities can result in the formation of a new business. Indeed, in a very
thoughtful reanalysis of data from two of their previous innovation studies (Cheng &
Van de Ven, 1996), what appear to be random events and activities in the initial
stages of a venture’s development can be understood as following a chaotic pattern.
Overall, the findings from these innovation studies indicate that the pattern of activities that might lead to organization formation does not appear to follow the same
sequential process.
Gatewood et al. (1995) studied 147 nascent entrepreneurs who had contact with a
Small Business Development Center between October 1990 and February 1991, and
explored whether certain cognitive factors as well as certain entrepreneurial activities led to the formation of a business (measured by whether sales had occurred)
1 year later (by February 1992). After a review of previous literature to identify
specific entrepreneurial activities, and the use of a focus group of SBDC counselors
to enlarge and revise this list, 29 separate entrepreneurial activities were generated
that were grouped into five categories of behavior: gathering market information,
estimating potential profits, finishing the groundwork for the business, developing
the structure of the company, and setting up business operations. This list of 29
entrepreneurial activities was mailed to the nascent entrepreneurs in the follow-up
survey. Nascent entrepreneurs were asked to indicate whether any of the 29 activities
were undertaken, and, for those activities, to estimate the number of hours they had
devoted to them. When an analysis of these responses were undertaken, Gatewood
et. al. (1995) found that activities involved with setting up business operations (e.g.,

<-----Page 10----->5

Entrepreneurial Behavior: Firm Organizing Processes

109

purchasing raw materials and supplies; hiring and training employees; producing,
distributing, and marketing a product or service) were significantly correlated to the
creation of a new firm (as measured by sales). The other categories of activities were
not significantly correlated to the subsequent establishment of a firm. It should be
noted that this study did not attempt to explore whether any particular sequence of
these activities might result in a new firm since specific dates for each activity were
not ascertained on the survey.
Carter et al. (1996) using data from a random sample of 683 adult residents
in Wisconsin and 1,016 adults across the United States, identified 71 nascent
entrepreneurs who had provided information on their startup activities. These
nascent entrepreneurs were initially surveyed about their startup activities between
1992 and 1993 and were re-interviewed 6–18 months later. This study explored three
broad questions: What activities do nascent entrepreneurs initiate when attempting
to start a business? How many activities do they initiate? When are particular activities initiated? Approximately, one-half of the respondents had initiated a business
by the time of the follow-up interview, over 30% were still engaged in activities
to start a business, and 20% had given up on their efforts at business formation.
In general, those nascent entrepreneurs who were able to establish a business were
more likely to engage in more business formation activities, and engage in these
business formation activities earlier, than the other two groups. For the first year of
the startup process, the activity levels of those nascent entrepreneurs who “gave up”
were very similar to the activity levels of those nascent entrepreneurs who established businesses. In subsequent periods the nascent entrepreneurs who gave up
engaged in fewer activities than those that successfully established firms. Those
nascent entrepreneurs who were in the “still trying” stage were likely to engage
in fewer activities compared to the other two groups. Similar to the findings of
Gatewood et al. (1995), it appeared that the nascent entrepreneurs who were able
to successfully start a new business engaged in activities that made their businesses
more tangible to others: they looked for facilities and equipment, they sought and
got financial support, formed a legal entity, bought facilities and equipment, and
were more likely to devote full time to the business. For those nascent entrepreneurs
who indicated that they had started a business: 94% had sales, 71% had filed a federal income tax statement for their business, 50% had positive cash flow, and 47%
were paying FICA taxes. Surprisingly, nascent entrepreneurs in the other two groups
(still trying and gave up) had also achieved some of these new firm startup markers:
50% of those that gave up and 48% of those who indicated they were still trying
had achieved sales, 19% of both those who gave up and those who were still trying
reported positive cash flow, and 19% of those still trying and 6% of those who had
given up had filed a federal income tax form for their business.
In undertaking the Carter et al. (1996) study, it became apparent that only
a limited amount of knowledge could be gleaned from a sample of 71 nascent
entrepreneurs. It was at this point, that Nancy M. Carter, William B. Gartner, and
Paul D. Reynolds conceived of a plan to involve other scholars in an effort to raise
funds for the development of much larger sample of nascent entrepreneurs. Except
for the pilot studies that served as the samples for Carter et al. (1996), previous

<-----Page 11----->110

W.B. Gartner et al.

efforts by Paul Reynolds to raise funds from government agencies for a national
panel study of nascent entrepreneurs had been unsuccessful (Reynolds, 2000). It
was believed that if a sufficient number of scholars could convince their institutions
to provide $20,000 each, these funds might be sufficient for a sample of hundreds
of nascent entrepreneurs. And, not only could more insights be gained into the
activities of nascent entrepreneurs, other questions about their startup efforts (e.g.,
their backgrounds, attitudes, network, net worth, and skills) could also be explored.
The genesis of the PSED was born; therefore, out of the frustrations of having
information on the behaviors of such a small sample of 71 nascent entrepreneurs.
The organization formation activities that were asked of the nascent
entrepreneurs in the PSED I and II are listed in Table 5.2. For PSED I, the list of
behaviors was generated, primarily, from combining lists of behaviors from Carter
et al. (1996) and Gatewood et al. (1995). Additional activities were also added. The

behavior, “arranged child care . . .” was added because there was prior theory and
evidence to suggest that this activity might predict the likelihood that female nascent
entrepreneurs would have the time to successfully start new businesses (Carter,
1997; Gilbert, 1997). As we noted earlier, activities that might be considered as
markers of the existence of an organization are also listed as startup behaviors. We
added four other startup marker activities: bank account opened; business has own
phone listing; business has own phone line; and paid managers who are owners a
salary. These particular activities were added after reviewing the literature on identifying organizations (Aldrich et al., 1989; Birley, 1984, 1986; Busenitz & Murphy,
1996; Kalleberg et al., 1990; Murphy, 2002). It is our contention that these markers
might also be important behaviors in the organization formation process, as well.
Such activities as “business has own phone listing,” is not only a signifier for determining that an organization might exist, it is a way for a nascent entrepreneur to
demonstrate to others (potential customers, investors, employees, suppliers) that
the emerging organization should merit their involvement (Gartner et al., 1992).
Indeed, in a recent study by Delmar and Shane (2003) which used data on nascent
entrepreneurs from a research effort in Sweden that was run parallel to the PSED
in the United States, arguments and empirical evidence are offered to support the
idea that certain startup markers (such as acquiring a business license) can be seen
as legitimizing activities (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Hannan & Freeman, 1984) and that
such activities significantly improves the chances that an on-going organization will
come into existence.
Based on analyses of the activities in PSED I, and interests of researchers
involved with PSED II, additional items were added. So, while there were 26 activities in PSED I, there were 34 startup activities in PSED II. Between PSED I and II,
there are 22 activities in common. In Table 5.2 we list a summary of the proportion
of respondents who reported each activity during the first detailed interview. Nearly
all nascent entrepreneurs reported giving serious thought to the startup effort. There
are six activities related to the new firm in regards to listing in various business

<-----Page 13----->112

W.B. Gartner et al.

registries. Less than one in five of the startups had completed any of these activities.
Table 5.2 shows that of the other activities listed, less than 10 had been initiated by
more than half of the nascent efforts. We suggest that this table indicated a wide
diversity of activities across all business startups.

Selected Findings on Entrepreneurial Behaviors
This section of the chapter will report on findings about entrepreneurial behavior,
that primarily, have come from the PSED I research program. We will begin with a
discussion of the likelihood that startup activities will result in the creation of an ongoing organization. We will then explore how startup activities, as a whole, influence
the likelihood of business creation. And, the final part of this section will provide
an overview of two specific entrepreneurial activities (opportunity recognition and
planning) and their relationship to business creation.
Reynolds (2007) found that 7 years after entering the firm creation process:
approximately one-third of the nascent entrepreneurs had quit, one-third reported
an on-going business, and one-third were still active in the startup process. He also
found that the median time for a new firm birth was 19–24 months while the median
time for those who quit was 25–30 months. By 36 months, approximately 75% of
new firms are created, while 75% of quits occur by 48 months.
Given the complexity of analyzing the 23 activities in PSED I, simultaneously,
Reynolds (2007:68–69) undertook a factor analysis of these activities to find six
domains
(1) “Business presence: The emphasis is on formal registration of the firm, full-time
attention by the nascent entrepreneur, and the beginning of hiring employees
(five items).
(2) Production implementation: Attention to acquiring inputs (supplies, inventory,
components), use of major assets, actual sale of the product or service (six
items).
(3) Organizational, financial structure: Mobilizing individuals, preparing future
plans, and acquisition of outside financial resources (four items).
(4) Personal planning: The nascent entrepreneur’s efforts to prepare for the business
and personal involvement (three items).
(5) Personal preparation: The nascent entrepreneur’s organization of their personal
life to become involved, by taking classes, saving money, or arranging for help
with childcare of housework (three items).
(6) Focus on the task or the product: Attention to developing the product or service
to be sold and acquiring formal property rights to the same (two items)”.
Reynolds (2007) develops an index for each domain and each time period
and compared these indices to three outcome measures 7 years after conception.
Only one index that of personal preparation, had no relationship to outcomes in
the seventh year. All of the other indices had, for some time periods, significant

<-----Page 14----->5

Entrepreneurial Behavior: Firm Organizing Processes

113

relationships to the three outcome measures. He suggests that this analysis indicates
that nascent entrepreneurs who emphasize a strong public presence, create an organizational and financial structure, and, develop a way to provide goods or services
are more likely to create new businesses. Entrepreneurs who successfully start businesses are also more likely to engage in higher levels of activity, over time, than
either the quits or the still active.
Another approach that has significant merit for understanding the processes of
organization creation, in total, is championed by Lichtenstein (1999, 2000). He uses
ideas from complexity theory (Dooley, 1997; Leifer, 1989; McKelvey, 1999; West,
1985) to suggest that organization creation activities: (1) will not occur at a constant rate over time, (2) will not obviously aggregate from specific activities, (3)
will be mutually interdependent, and (4) that the outcomes of these activities will
be non-proportional. While not wanting to simplify his logic and ideas, non-linear
approaches for exploring entrepreneurial can show, “order” in what appear to be
random patterns of activity. Lichtenstein (1999, 2000) has also been able to demonstrate how complexity theory has practical implications for how individuals might
behave in emergent situations. In an empirical examination of the dynamic patterns
of the startup activities in PSED 1, Lichtenstein, Carter, Dooley, and Gartner (2007)
found that when: (1) the rate of startup activities is high, (2) startup activities are
spread out over time, and (3) startup activities are concentrated later rather than earlier, the emergence of a new firm was more likely. Brush et al. (2008) also noticed
that when nascent entrepreneurs “take more time to accumulate properties” (p. 563)
they were more likely to continue in the process of organizing.

Opportunity Recognition
A number of scholars suggest that the idea of “opportunity” is a fundamental and critical aspect of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship (Alvarez &
Barney, 2007; Buenstorf, 2007; Casson & Wadeson, 2007; Companys &
McMullen, 2007; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Kirzner, 1997; McMullen et al., 2007;
Plummer et al., 2007; Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Shepherd et al.,
2007; Stevenson, 1983; Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985; Stevenson, & Jarillo, 1990).
Indeed, one of the entrepreneurship field’s core definitions focuses on opportunity: “From our perspective, entrepreneurship is an approach to management that
we define as follows: the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled” (Stevenson, 1983). Yet, recent discussions about characteristics
of opportunity, as an aspect of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship (e.g., Alvarez &
Barney, 2007; McMullen et al., 2007; Plummer et al., 2007; Shepherd et al., 2007)
appears to be somewhat myopic in regards to the relevance of contributions from
a variety of sources outside of economics to this discourse. Because Shane and
Venkataraman’s (2000) article on the importance of opportunity to the study of
entrepreneurship has become fundamental to views of the nature of entrepreneurship, there has been a great deal of thoughtful discussion about definitions of the
attributes of opportunity and explorations of the processes by which opportunity

<-----Page 15----->114

W.B. Gartner et al.

occurs, as well as the beginnings of specifying the value of the concept of opportunity to entrepreneurial studies (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Buenstorf, 2007; Casson &
Wadeson, 2007; Companys & McMullen, 2007; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; McMullen
et al., 2007; Plummer et al., 2007; Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000;
Singh, 2001; Zahra & Dess, 2001). While there is some systematic evidence about
the nature of opportunity by which these current ideas can be tested (Busenitz, 1996;
Hills & Schrader, 1998; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Shane, 2000; Singh et al., 1999),
we believe the interpretations of these results are, at best, equivocal. The evidence
from individuals involved in opportunity discovery and recognition is meager. We
believe that data from the PSED can provide many insights into how the process of
opportunity discovery and recognition actually occurs.
Discussions about the nature of opportunity are discussions about how circumstances external to the entrepreneur are construed. Most scholars currently pursue
a line of reasoning about the nature of opportunity that suggests that opportunities
are, sort-of-speak, concrete realities waiting to be noticed, discovered, or observed
by entrepreneurs (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Kirzner, 1997; Shane, 2000; Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000). This view has come to be labeled as the “opportunity discovery” perspective (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Gartner & Carter, 2003). Such a
perspective uses the economics literature to emphasize the importance of alertness, observation, and the informational asymmetries among all individuals who
are pursing their best interests (Arrow, 1974; Hayek, 1945). We propose another
alternative. We argue that in many circumstances, opportunities are enacted, that
is, the salient features of an opportunity only become apparent through the ways
that entrepreneurs make sense of their experiences (Gartner & Carter, 2003; Gartner
et al., 1992; Sarasvathy, 2001; Weick, 1979). Indeed, we suggest that merely by talking about opportunities as a part of the circumstances of entrepreneurship, scholars
invoke a way of making sense of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship that provokes entrepreneurs to see their experiences in a certain way. Entrepreneurs may talk
about “discovering opportunities” because that is the way we (academic scholars)
ask them to talk about opportunity.
In the opportunity enactment perspective, opportunities are seen to emerge out
of the imagination of individuals by their actions and their interactions with others (Daft & Weick, 1984; Dutton, 1993a, 1993b; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Gioia
et al., 2000; Hill & Levenhagen, 1995; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Scott & Lane,
2000; Thomas et al., 1993). Conceptualizing entrepreneurship and opportunity as
an emergent cognitive and social process is not new to the field of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1993; Gartner et al., 1992; Shaver & Scott, 1991; Stevenson, 1983;
Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985; Stevenson, & Jarillo, 1990), yet, social psychological
approaches to the study of this phenomenon seem to have been lost in the current
fashion for an economic rationality to this process.
Since the theory and logic of these two perspectives are covered in more detail
elsewhere (Gartner et al., 2003), we will offer evidence from Gartner and Shaver
(2009) using data from PSED 1 to suggest there is no preponderance of evidence
for either view. This study explores the label “opportunity” in the strategic issue
literature as a point of departure for offering an attributional framework for categorizing opportunities entrepreneurs offer as they undertook efforts to start businesses.

<-----Page 16----->5

Entrepreneurial Behavior: Firm Organizing Processes

115

The strategic issue literature broadly labels opportunities as: positive, controllable,
and involve potential gain (Dutton & Jackson, 1988; Thomas et al., 1993). The
article demonstrates that this is similar to an attribution theory approach. Openended questions from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) were
analyzed in which entrepreneurs offered comments about reasons for starting their
businesses and problems they faced during the startup of their firms. Entrepreneurs
were more likely to offer attributions about their opportunities that can be categorized as dependent on their abilities (internal and stable attributions) and efforts
(internal and variable attributions). We suggest that this study provides evidence
about the kinds of attributions entrepreneurs are likely to offer about opportunities supports perspectives that suggest that entrepreneurial action stems from the
resources that are within these entrepreneurs’ immediate control (Baker & Nelson,
2005; Sarasvathy, 2001, 2008) as well as from their own efforts and activities.
Given an appreciation that the phenomenon of entrepreneurial activity is very
diverse, and that for many nascent entrepreneurs, a broad range of startup activities
are occurring before they appear to “discover” their opportunity. Indeed, we wonder
whether many of these nascent entrepreneur ever “discover” an opportunity, at all.
Overall, we do not believe there is a preponderance of support for a belief that
most entrepreneurs see opportunities in an objective way, that is, there is not very
much evidence that opportunities are discovered in the manner assumed by some
academic scholars (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Kirzner, 1997;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Much more empirical evidence on the actual process
of opportunity recognition needs to occur. Both PSED I + II provide evidence to be
used to explore this topic in more detail.

Planning1
Frederic Delmar and Scott Shane (2003) offer four broad reasons for why
entrepreneurs should engage in planning during the process of venture creation.
They suggest that planning helps individuals develop a framework and context for
taking action so that individuals can: (1) quickly identify what they do not know, (2)
understand what resources they need and when these resources might be utilized,
and (3) identify specific actions that can help solve problems and attain goals, and
(4) help communicate to others the purposes, objectives, and activities necessary to
achieve venture success.
Entrepreneurs who develop a plan become conscious of their assumptions about
how their proposed new business will succeed. Assumptions regarding: the ability
of the new firm to be profitable, the amount of resources necessary to start and
operate the firm, the knowledge necessary to provide products and services in a

W.B. Gartner et al.

timely and cost-effective manner, and number of potential customers are just a few
of the many issues that entrepreneurs would consider when planning. By surfacing
these assumptions, entrepreneurs can test their beliefs, rather than invest time and
resources in actions that may have little chance of succeeding. Planning, therefore,
can save time and money in the venture creation process.
Planning can also reduce the likelihood that there will be delays in organizing the
new venture, acquiring plant and equipment, as well as producing goods or providing services. Planning can help an entrepreneur identify when key resources (such as
inventory, equipment, licenses and permits, trained personnel) will likely be needed
during the business creation process, thereby saving time and money (Armstrong,
1982; Bracker et al., 1988).
Planning can help entrepreneurs identify specific actions they will need to take
to achieve their goals (Locke & Latham, 1980). By identifying specific actions,
entrepreneurs can focus their efforts, as well as realize when their efforts are not
producing their desired goals. Planning, therefore, keeps individuals “on track” by
channeling their energy and providing benchmarks (Robinson, 1984; Schrader et al.,
1984).
Finally, planning helps entrepreneurs communicate their vision to others, thereby
enabling the emerging venture to gain support and resources (Bird, 1992). By having
a plan, entrepreneurs can thereby enlist potential investors, suppliers, customers, and
employees into involvement in the new venture. A business plan also represents a
form of “legitimacy,” in that entrepreneurs who have a plan are likely to be seen by
others as individuals who have knowledge of the requirements for business success,
rather than “dreamers” who are unaware of potential pitfalls in the startup process
(Delmar & Shane, 2004; Honig & Karlsson, 2004).
One of the major problems in the search for research on the value of planning for
creating new ventures is that most studies have not actually looked at new business
creation. For example, Bhide (2000) uses as his primary source of data, businesses
on the INC Magazine list of the 500 fastest growing private firms in the United
States. His sample, then, looks at already established firms, and only firms that have
high rates of sales growth. There are no failures in Bhide’s sample and there are no
low growth firms either, to compare with the high growth sales firms. When a study
looks only at successful firms there is a high likelihood that the study has “survivor
bias.” The successful firms are “survivors” in that over a period of time many firms
would have likely failed, and, the failures would not be listed in a register of the
“survivors” to be studied.
The number of research studies that have compared entrepreneurs who have successfully created new firms with entrepreneurs who have failed at this process, is
very small. Indeed, the studies that have looked at planning and its influence on new
venture creation stem from data that either use the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial
Dynamics (Liao & Gartner, 2006; Reynolds, 2007) or use data collection methods and questions based on the PSED (Delmar & Shane, 2003, 2004; Honig &
Karlsson, 2004; Shane & Delmar, 2004). Table 5.3 lists the studies that have focused
on planning during the process of business creation, the size of these samples, and
highlights of their findings about the value of planning and success at getting into
business.

These studies strongly suggest that planning matters [with Honig and Karlsson
(2004) finding a nearly significant result, p > .10]. Entrepreneurs who complete a
business plan are more likely to either: continue in the business startup process, or
actually start a business than those individuals who do not plan.
There are a number of other factors that influence whether entrepreneurs will be
successful in the venture creation process. For example, Delmar and Shane (2003)
suggest that the nature of the opportunity pursued by entrepreneurs has a more significant impact on success than the act of planning, itself, though in terms of actions
that an entrepreneur can take, planning is the most important activity to engage
in. Liao and Gartner (2006) found that entrepreneurs who were more uncertain
about their chances of financing their businesses and more uncertain about their
understanding the competitive dynamics of their industries were more likely to
be successful if they planned early in the startup process, rather than later. Shane
and Delmar (2004) found that entrepreneurs who completed business plans before
engaging in efforts to talk to customers and engage in marketing and promotional
efforts were more likely to be successful in continuing in their startup efforts (i.e.,
not quit).
Overall, it would seem that completing a business plan is beneficial to enabling
entrepreneurs to successfully create new businesses. Even though there are differences in: the various sample sizes used from each of the two major samples
(US PSED and the Swedish PSED); how certain measures were constructed to
indicate planning, as well as success at getting into business; and the analytical techniques used to evaluate the data, the results seem to be fairly robust.
Business planning is an important activity that significantly correlates with creating
new ventures.

Recommendations for Future Research
It is our belief that the Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics I and II is a
decisive moment in the study of entrepreneurship. The PSED studies are the first
large-scale national database to offer systematic, reliable, and generalizable data on
the process of business formation. While no data set can provide all of the answers
about firm formation processes, it is our expectation that the PSED studies can offer
a foundation of generalizable findings about entrepreneurial behavior. What should
not be underestimated is the value of having the depth and breadth of information on
this sample of nascent entrepreneurs. A major complaint about many entrepreneurship studies has been the idiosyncratic nature of the samples used (Gartner, 1989). It
has been difficult to judge whether a sample of entrepreneurs is similar or different
to other kinds of samples of entrepreneurs, to entrepreneurs overall, or to nonentrepreneurs. Since the PSED is a generalizable sample of all nascent entrepreneurs
in the population (as well as a generalizable sample of non-nascent entrepreneurs),
the PSED provides a way to compare any sample of entrepreneurs to the population of nascent entrepreneurs, and to the population of non-nascent entrepreneurs.

<-----Page 21----->120

W.B. Gartner et al.

In addition, given the longitudinal nature of the PSED, the dataset also will be valuable for studying differences between the population of nascent entrepreneurs to
those individuals who become the founders of established businesses. Studies of
nascent entrepreneurs in the PSED should therefore provide important signposts
for guiding all knowledge development in the entrepreneurship field. We hope that
more scholars will devote the time and effort needed to explore this rich source of
information on entrepreneurs.
Besides studies that utilize the PSED, there are a number of other ways that
research on firm formation processes can and should be conducted. We suggest
certain methodologies, rather than specific studies of entrepreneurial situations best
apply those approaches.
There is a great need for scholars to undertake in-depth case studies (Stake, 2000)
of the activities of individuals involved in the process of starting business. Firm
formation involves a multitude of interdependent activities among a variety of individuals (e.g., founders; investors; prospective employees, buyers, and suppliers; and
paid and unpaid mentors and advisors). Systematic evidence needs to be generated
to better understand how all of these different actors interrelate during the founding process. In addition, there is very little evidence about the “micro-behaviors” of
organization founders. For example, there is not much beyond anecdotal evidence
about the specific behaviors and the sequences of these behaviors when nascent
entrepreneurs actually negotiate with others for critical resources to start a new business (Baker & Nelson, 2005). What, specifically, occurs when nascent entrepreneurs
attempt to convince other individuals to become investors? Do nascent entrepreneurs
follow similar negotiating strategies and tactics (compared to managers or individuals in other negotiation situations), or are there unique characteristics of organization
formation that require different behaviors? We would assume that the indeterminate and future-oriented characteristics of firm founding would influence how the
process of negotiation occurred among nascent entrepreneurs and others, and that
these characteristics of the situation (indeterminacy and future orientation) would
be different than other kinds of negotiations.
We would also hope that some scholars would devote their efforts to documenting
and discussing their own involvement in entrepreneurial activities through participant observation (Tedlock, 2000), action research (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000),
and the exposition of their own narratives and stories of organization formation
through reflexivity, personal narrative, and autoethnography (Ellis & Bochner, 2000;
Gartner, 2007). In addition, many highly successful entrepreneurs have written autobiographies of their experiences that could be explored for insights (Gartner, 2007;
Silverman, 2000).
Finally, while there can, and should, be scholarly efforts to explore entrepreneurial behavior using more controlled methodologies (e.g., lab studies and simulations), it is our belief that major gains in scholarship on organization formation
activities will primarily occur through field research. The phenomenon of organization formation, itself, is larger than a particular theoretical perspective or methodology. So, we celebrate using multiple theories and multiple methods to understand
organization formation that can look at this phenomenon comprehensively. We take

seriously Weick’s admonition to “Complicate Yourselves” (Weick, 1979), that is,
scholars need to recognize that no one particular theory or method can adequately
explain the phenomenon under observation, and that a variety of approaches are
required.
If our experiences studying the process of organization formation have shown
us anything, it is that there is: substantial variation in the kinds of organizations
that are started by nascent entrepreneurs; substantial variation in the characteristics that would signal to researchers that these organizations, do, indeed exist; and
substantial variation in when these characteristics that signal the existence of these
new organizations, occur. There is no escaping this fact—entrepreneurial behavior
is fundamentally an activity involved with generating “variation” as an organizational phenomenon (Aldrich, 1999; Katz & Gartner, 1988; Weick, 1979). There is
no one particular way in how organizations emerge because there is no one particular kind of organization that results as an outcome of the startup process (Gartner
et al., 1989; Reynolds, 2007). Research that can both recognize variation in the
phenomenon of organization creation, while also offering insights into how these
diverse activities might lead to patterns of successful formation of organizations is
needed and required (Reynolds, 2007).
