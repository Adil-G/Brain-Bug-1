The dynamic ownership arrangements surrounding the venture capitalist–entrepreneur (VCE) relationship inherent in new ventures make the examination of principals’ or venture capitalists’ (VCs) and agents’ (entrepreneurs) governance arrangements interesting to explore.
This article examines the limitations of agency theory and then stewardship theory in
explaining the behaviors of individuals in the VC-E relationship. Our analysis points out the
potential problems inherent in each theory’s explanatory ability as it relates to the VC-E relationship. Lastly, theoretical gaps in the VC-E relationship are discussed along with suggestions for new theory surrounding this important and intriguing relationship.

ntrepreneurs typically start firms with an innovative idea with the anticipation that
the venture will become a long-term success. Often the new venture obtains some business angel financing to aid its development (Mason & Harrison, 1996). If the venture
achieves some early success, resource gaps often emerge and need to be filled if the
venture is going to achieve its potential. As the venture progresses through the initial
startup phase, venture capital investments are often sought. In addition to providing risk
capital to high potential ventures in exchange for partial ownership of the firm, venture
capitalists (VCs) are typically active investors who seek to add value through their interaction with and advice for the managers of the entrepreneurial venture (Macmillan,
Kulow, & Khoylian, 1989; Bygrave & Timmons, 1992), as well as through their

Gupta, 1994). Given the substantial equity stake that VCs typically take in a firm, the
relationship between VCs and the entrepreneurs that they fund has been compared to that
of large block stockholders in leveraged-buyout firms (Jain & Kini, 1995).
Efforts to explain this intriguing VC-E relationship have relied on agency theory and
its assumptions (e.g., Barney et al., 1989; Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza & Gupta, 1994).
Agency theory prescribes actions that focus on the protection of the investment of the
principal (VC) against the harmful behaviors of the agent (entrepreneur) (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976). Whereas agency theory has been developed primarily in the context
of publicly traded firms with diffuse ownership structures and managers with very limited
equity stake, its logic has some appeal for explaining the VC-E relationship. When VCs
buy into a venture, they are like outside stakeholders (or large blockholders) who carefully observe the firm to track its business potential and monitor agent behavior to protect
against opportunism. Except for a few isolated articles (e.g., Cable & Shane, 1997;
Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996), agency theory has been the dominant theoretical perspective applied to the VC-E relationship. However, some cracks are beginning to appear
in the agency logic as applied to VC-backed firms (Bruton et al., 1997; 2000; Busenitz
et al., 2001). This article probes temporal issues in the VC-E relationship. It appears that
the dominance of agency theory in explaining the VC-E relationship is partially misdirected because of its insensitivity to temporal boundaries. Researchers applying agency
theory to explain certain phenomena in the VC-E relationship will likely generate theoretical misspecifications or draw indefensible conclusions unless the timing for the use
of agency theory is appropriate. Interestingly, recent research fails to find much relevance
of agency theory in explaining the business angel/entrepreneur relationship (e.g., Kelly
& Hay, 2001; Landstrom, 1992; van Osnabrugge, 2000).
At issue is the idea of goal congruence between the VC and the entrepreneur. When
there is goal congruence between the two, agency theory is silent. Only when there is
goal incongruence between the two is agency theory applicable. Thus, researchers must
provide a theoretical rationale for why goals between the two have diverged before applying agency theory to explain the behaviors.
Like agency theory, stewardship theory also focuses on goal alignment between the
principal (VC) and the steward (entrepreneur). Since stewardship theory assumes that the
goals of the principal and steward are aligned, it would seem that this theory could further
inform our understanding of the VC-E relationship. However, our analysis will indicate
that stewardship theory is inadequate to explain most of the VC-E relationship because
it implicitly assumes the subordination of the steward’s (entrepreneur’s) goals. More
specifically, the steward subdues his or her self-interest in order to serve the interests of
the principal. This assumption pushes stewardship theory outside the nomological net
surrounding the actual dynamics of the VC-E relationship. In essence, researchers have
tended to ignore the individual entrepreneur and his or her goals and vision for the venture
and have instead placed overemphasis on the principal.
This article proceeds in the following manner. First, it addresses agency concerns
and attempts to clarify the contribution and limitations of agency theory as it pertains
to the VC-E relationship. Second, it analyzes stewardship theory and shows why it is a
particularly limited paradigm for explaining the VC-E relationship. Lastly, the theoretical gaps in explaining the VC-E relationship are discussed and directions for theory
are offered. In viewing the shortcomings of agency and stewardship theories in explaining the VC-E relationship, attention is focused on how these theories tend to overlook the goals and motivations of the entrepreneurs and overemphasize the centrality of
the VC.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->Agency Theory in the VC–E Relationship
Agency theory has emerged as the dominant theory in explaining the VC-E relationship in entrepreneurship literature (cf. Barney et al., 1989; Amit et al., 1990; Sapienza
& Gupta, 1994; Sahlman, 1990). This principal-agent relationship arises when the entrepreneur engages a VC for funding of a new venture (Amit et al., 1990; Sahlman, 1990).
According to agency theory, an agency problem can arise between the entrepreneur
(agent) and VC (principal) as a result of incongruent goals and potentially different risk
preferences (Eisenhardt, 1989; Bruton et al., 1997). This theory assumes that both the
agent and principal are self-interested and boundedly rational (Eisenhardt, 1989), consequently, individual utility-maximizing behavior is likely to emerge if proper incentives
and controls to align the goals of the entrepreneur with the VC are not enacted.
Bounded rationality on the part of each actor gives rise to information asymmetry
between the parties (Amit et al., 1990; MacIntosh, 1994; Amit et al., 1998; Bohren, 1998).
This information asymmetry may allow an entrepreneur to engage in opportunistic behavior, more specifically, adverse selection or moral hazard (Amit et al., 1998; Chan, 1983;
Williamson, 1985). Adverse selection is the misrepresentation of ability on the part of
the agent. For example, the entrepreneur may attempt to “oversell” the merits and viability of the venture (Levy & Lazarovich-Porat, 1995) in order to secure more favorable
financing terms (Amit et al., 1998). In addition, the entrepreneur may claim to have
greater knowledge about a particular technology than is true. Moral hazard refers to negative behaviors such as a lack of effort or shirking by the agent. For example, an entrepreneur may expend effort on activities that maximize personal utility but such efforts
may add little or no value to the venture. Furthermore, the entrepreneur may use VC
funds to purchase excessive perquisites.

Normative Versus Positivist Elements of Agency Theory
Bacharach (1989) has argued that the primary goal of a theory is to answer the questions of when, how, and why. A primary concern here is to identify the temporal boundaries of agency theory’s explanatory ability for the VC-E relationship. Thus, this article
first addresses when agency theory has the greatest potential in explaining behaviors in
the VC-E relationship. In order to point out agency theory’s limitations for the VC-E relationship, the difference between the normative and positivist elements of agency theory
are specified (cf. Jensen, 1983). Normative elements are prescriptive and are directed
toward accomplishing some objective given certain limitations. Jensen (1983, p. 320)
states, “Answers to normative questions always depend on the choice of the criterion or
objective function which is a matter of values. Therefore, normative propositions are
never refutable by evidence.” A normative question for agency theory would be: “How
can the principal best avoid the agency problem?” In contrast, positivist elements are
explanatory in nature—they provide explanation for a given phenomenon. On this point,
Jensen (1983, p. 320) writes, “Answers to positive questions, on the other hand, involve
discovery of some aspect of how the world behaves and are always potentially refutable
by contradictory evidence.” A positivist question for agency theory would be: “How does
separation of ownership and control affect the value of a firm?”
The enumeration of these two elements of theory is important because together
they provide insight into boundary problems for any given set of research questions.
Within management and entrepreneurship literatures, many of agency theory’s normative
assumptions have been adopted as given and then applied within a certain realm such as
diversification or compensation to explain interesting phenomena or behaviors (Balkin,
Winter, 2003

147

<-----Page 3----->Markman & Gomez-Mejia, 2000; Fox & Hamilton, 1994). If non-significance or weak
significance is observed, the normative assumptions may not be applicable to the situation under study, or may not be applicable at certain times. This does not mean that the
normative assumptions are necessarily false. If the normative assumptions are not applicable at certain times, then the researcher must first specify the logical timing of when
those assumptions are applicable and then take observations during those time periods
(Mitchell & James, 2001). Naturally, such an approach limits the generalizability of the
theory but increases its precision (Dubin, 1978). The researcher’s assumptions will drive
his or her selection of the dependent and independent variables under examination for
any given study. This makes the clear specification and demarcation of theory in time
and space vitally important in order to avoid the identification of spurious relationships,
let alone non-significance in true relationships.

Boundaries of Agency Theory in the VC-E Relationship
One of the primary normative prescriptions of agency theory is that the principal
should seek to avoid or mitigate the agency problem (Jensen & Meckling, 1976;
Eisenhardt, 1989). However, it appears that the agency problem is not uniform throughout the life of a venture. As a result, agency theory is likely to vary in its usefulness
in explaining the VC and entrepreneur behaviors. For example, agency theory may be
most applicable in explaining behaviors immediately prior to the initial investment VCs
make in a new venture. Then, after the VC has invested in the new venture, it appears
that agency concerns rapidly decline followed later by some potential upswings. To
clarify these arguments, a distinction is made between actual goals and perceived
goals between the VC and entrepreneur. An embedded assumption of Figure 1 is that the
market for VC capital is not efficient in that the future value of a venture remains largely
ambiguous.
When the goals of the VC and entrepreneur are aligned, there is no agency problem
(Eisenhardt, 1989). Agency theory prescribes actions for the VC such as offering incentives and utilizing monitoring to achieve this goal alignment in order to protect against

Thus, agency theory attempts to move the relationship into the upper left quadrant of
Figure 1 where there is no agency problem. Note, however, that agency theory offers
little explanation concerning behaviors after this alignment of goals is achieved. In effect,
agency theory is something of a precursor to explaining behaviors when there is actual
goal congruence. When the goals of the principal (VC) and agent (entrepreneur) are
aligned, the normative assumptions of agency theory are temporarily less or not applicable in explaining behaviors (Jensen, 1983). Assumptions can be made about how the
principal would act if the relationship were in this quadrant. For example, the principal
is likely to be more trusting and cooperative toward the agent if the relationship were in
this quadrant. However, agency theory’s normative focus is on avoiding or mitigating the
potential agency problem. Thus, agency theory has little to say after the relationship is
in this quadrant except to warn about the possibility of an agency problem.
Agency theory also has some limitations in explaining behavior in the upper right
quadrant of Figure 1 where actual goals are aligned but perceived goals are different. In
the case where actual goals between VCs and entrepreneurs are the same but the VC perceives them to be different, a blind spot for agency theory develops because it imputes
goal misalignment as the cause of an agency problem. In this situation, there is no actual
agency problem (e.g., no goal misalignment) even though the principal may perceive an
agency problem. In such a case, the principal’s (VC’s) behavior will tend to be based on
his or her perceptions. For example, the principal (VC) may implement a much more
extensive contract than is necessary or dismiss the agent (entrepreneur) or engage in
excessive monitoring. Therefore, agency theory’s normative assumptions are likely to
encourage overbearing contracts and unnecessary structural constraints in this quadrant.
Any evidence of an agency problem would be the result of a Type I error. This brings up
a fascinating issue in that a researcher querying only the principal (VC) would confirm
the normative assumptions of agency theory and would accurately explain the behavior
of the principal (VC) using agency theory. Thus, if the researcher were strictly interested
in the principal’s perceptions, then the use of agency theory would likely provide significant results. However, the researcher querying only the entrepreneur would not
confirm the normative assumptions of agency theory and would not be able to explain
the behavior of the agent (entrepreneur) using agency theory. The use of agency theory
in this situation would be a theoretical misspecification for the results (cf. James, Mulaik,
& Brett, 1982). For example, Lane, Cannella, and Lubatkin (1998) reanalyzed the results
of Amihud and Lev (1981) and found results that were actually contrary to the original
agency theory pronouncements.
When the actual goals of both the VC and entrepreneur are different. then a potential agency problem exists. Thus, agency theory’s normative assumptions are valid for
the two bottom quadrants of Figure 1. Agency theory argues that it is important for the
principal (VC) to engage in monitoring of the agent (entrepreneur) in order to occlude
and/or uncover any agency problem. In effect, agency theory warns that the potential
agency problem should drive the principal (VC) to invest in certain monitoring mechanisms and to offer certain incentives or else the result will be a manifesting of adverse
selection and/or moral hazard on the part of the agent (entrepreneur). That is, the principal-agent (VC-E) relationship will move to the bottom right quadrant in Figure 1. By
investing in monitoring mechanisms and by offering incentives to the agent, however,
the principal-agent (VC-E) relationship will move to the upper left quadrant of goal
alignment. Thus, as long as the principal (VC) takes certain steps up front before employing the agent (entrepreneur), the agency problem will largely be mitigated a priori
(Williamson, 1988).

<-----Page 5----->The actual goal and perceived goal alignment of VCs and entrepreneurs provides a
clearer picture of why agency theory is particularly applicable before the VC’s decision
to invest in the new venture but less applicable after the investment decision is made.
Before the VC has invested in the new venture, the VC is likely to be focused on the due
diligence process so as to avoid a bad investment decision. The VC does not know the
motivation of the entrepreneur and must assume the worst in order to protect his or her
investment. On the other hand, the entrepreneur’s goal is likely venture success (or it is
unknown). At this point, the actual goals of each are different, giving rise to potential
agency problems. However, after the VC has decided to invest in the new venture, the
VC’s goal becomes venture success. Thus, after the VC has decided to invest in the
venture, the VC and entrepreneur’s goals tend to become aligned. It is important to
specify, however, that because of a potential hidden agency problem, the VC will utilize
mechanisms to safeguard his or her investment. These safeguards in effect seek to ensure
that the VC-E relationship is pushed into the upper left quadrant of the 2 ¥ 2 matrix in
Figure 1. The following section details these mechanisms and confirms agency theory’s
applicability in explaining behaviors in the VC-E relationship particularly before the VC’s
investment decision.

Agency Problem Mitigation Before the VC’s Investment Decision
Before investing in a new venture, the VC typically conducts a due diligence assessment of the venture and the entrepreneur (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). It is during this time
that the VC’s uncertainty concerning the entrepreneur and the venture will likely be the
highest (Galbraith, 1977). For the VC, the due diligence process is a form of insurance
against potential adverse selection as previously mentioned. The VC can better determine
the entrepreneur’s credibility and the viability of the new venture before deciding to
invest; as a result, potential agency problems (particularly adverse selection) can be
mitigated beforehand.
The VC’s trepidations concerning adverse selection or moral hazard on the part of
the entrepreneur will be reduced by the due diligence process. Four additional mechanisms are also likely to reduce the potential for agency problems. First, the entrepreneur’s
bonding (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) will act to occlude behaviors on the part of the entrepreneur that would be detrimental to the venture’s success. For example, the entrepreneur typically will have invested a substantial portion of his or her personal wealth in the
venture (Busenitz et al., 2001). Any behaviors by the entrepreneur that would increase
the likelihood of venture failure (such as purchasing excess perquisites) in order to grasp
a short-term benefit would likely be avoided (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). The entrepreneur’s personal wealth tied up in the venture is a transaction-specific asset that cannot
be redeployed or recouped if the venture fails. Thus, this personal investment is a form
of self-bonding. Second, the contractual obligations of the entrepreneur specified by the
VC in the financing agreement will act to reduce the likelihood of future moral hazard
due to the legal and financial ramifications. Third, the incentives provided the entrepreneur for meeting certain venture performance goals will also reduce the likelihood of
future moral hazard. Finally, the VC’s monitoring of the venture, its performance, and
the decision making of the entrepreneur will also reduce the likelihood of moral hazard
on the part of the entrepreneur.
It is important to point out that these mechanisms are agreed upon or have occurred
before the VC’s final decision to invest in the venture. This would tend to suggest that
most potential agency problems are addressed and minimized before the actual investment by the VC.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Agency Problems after the Investment Decision
The argument here is that agency problems are to a large extent addressed before
VCs actually invest in a new venture. That is, goals become aligned after the VC makes
the decision to invest in the new venture. This logic is consistent with the findings
reported by van Osnabrugge (2000) that VCs are most concerned with reducing agency
costs in the pre-investment process. Figure 2 models the relevance of agency theory to
the VC-E relationship over time, by placing time on the horizontal axis and the likelihood of the agency problem on the vertical axis.
Note that agency theory’s normative assumptions would place the probability of an
agency problem as high (line 1 in Figure 2) when protective mechanisms are not in place.
The agency theory prescriptions for the VC to engage in monitoring and to provide incentives to align the goals of the entrepreneur with those of the VC should partially reduce
the likelihood of an agency problem (line 2 in Figure 2). Without temporal boundaries,
however, agency theory’s normative assumptions would indicate that the possibility of
the agency problem should remain significant even with protective measures in place. By
specifying logical temporal boundaries, it would appear that the more realistic likelihood
of an agency problem will curve drastically downward initially followed later by possible inflexion points that would cause the curve to slope upward (line 3 in Figure 2).
Consequently, during those times when the likelihood of an agency problem is low, the
use of agency theory to explain behaviors would be improper.
Once the investment has been made, the probability of opportunistic type behavior
occurring in the VC-E relationship will be low and probably slightly decreasing over time
as reflected in line 3 of Figure 2. As the VC and entrepreneur work together over time,

<-----Page 7----->the VC-E relationship has the potential to move beyond just the more formal financierentrepreneur relationship with the common goal of a successful venture exit. Research
suggests that VCs sometimes become friends and close confidants of entrepreneurs;
indeed, entrepreneurs often desire even more involvement with their VCs (Ehlrich et al.,
1994; Bygrave & Timmons, 1992; Perry, 1988). When such a relationship builds, the
probability of opportunistic behavior on the part of the entrepreneur should usually
decline. That is, trust (rather than distrust) will likely become the dominant ethic in
the relationship. Using the assumptions from agency theory, researchers examining the
behaviors of each party during those time periods when trust is likely high between
the VC and entrepreneur would have an increased chance of obtaining non-significant
results.
It is argued here that the inflexion points (indicating an increased likelihood of an
agency problem) can be triggered by signals from either the entrepreneur or venture itself.
An entrepreneur’s actions may signal to the VC the possibility of malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance. For example, if ongoing disagreements emerged concerning
certain venture decisions or if the VC perceived that the entrepreneur was being duplicitous or deceptive, the likelihood of goal incongruence between the two and the potential for opportunism on the part of the entrepreneur would likely rise. Note, however, that
these signals would likely emerge over time and would change the way the venture capitalist dealt with the entrepreneur. Venture signals would include the perception by the
VC that the business model was not going to be successful, or that emerging competition was going to prevent the new venture from succeeding. This type of signal could
indicate a potential increase in the likelihood of an agency problem because the VC would
be concerned with some sort of opportunistic defection on the part of the entrepreneur
(Cable & Shane, 1997). If strong enough, these signals (in effect) indicate that the future
value of the venture is substantially less than was previously believed. Game theorists
would argue that the situation would have become something of a terminal prisoner’s
dilemma in which each player’s dominant strategy would be to defect from the relationship (Rasmusen, 2001). On the other hand, if the venture remained on course to meet its
goal of attaining IPO, the potential for an agency problem would likely continue to
decline over time.1 Without these signals or inflexion points, the use of agency theory to
explain behaviors in the VC-E relationship by researchers would seem unwarranted after
the VC has decided to invest in the new venture.

Limitations of Agency Theory
The limitations of agency theory for explaining behaviors in the VC-E relationship
can now be summarized. Agency theory has provided both predictions and prescriptions
for explaining individual behavior when outside ownership is involved (Bohren, 1998;
Jensen, 1983). A key prescription of the theory is for principals to minimize the agency
costs by imposing internal controls to restrain the agent’s self-serving behavior (Jensen
& Meckling, 1976; Davis et al., 1997). It is assumed that if there is no principal-agent
(VC-E) goal incongruence then the agent’s self-interested utility-maximizing behavior
will result in wealth maximization for the principal (VC). Interestingly, a second key
prescription of agency theory that has thus far obtained only weak or no association in

involved, we suspect that a new set of agency issues come to the forefront. However, the post-IPO era is
beyond the scope of this analysis.

152

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->organization research is the idea of better goal alignment between principal (VC) and
agent (entrepreneur) through compensation incentives and partial ownership schemes
(Bohren, 1998; Balkin et al., 2000). The assumption is that these incentives will spur the
agent (entrepreneur) to maximize his or her utility and concomitantly maximize the
wealth of the firm.
The general lack of empirical support for an agency relationship among VCs and
entrepreneurs (Bruton et al., 2000; Busenitz et al., 2001) suggests at least two responses.
One, there are those who would suggest that future research should adjust and do a better
job measuring agency variables. For example, in response to their nonsignificant findings on the impact of ownership levels, Sapienza and Gupta (1994) suggested alternative
ownership measures. They also suggested focusing more on process rather than on structural issues and encouraged longitudinal studies. A second response, and the position of
this article, recognizes the limitations in agency theory’s explicative ability. While the
logic of improving firm performance by aligning the goals of the agent with the owner
seems unassailable, a partial financial ownership stake does not seem to necessarily spur
an agent to behave in ways that an owner would (Pierce et al., 1991).
While agency theory seems useful for explaining the VC-E relationship before the
VC’s decision to invest in the new venture, its explanatory power becomes more limited
once the VC decides to invest in the new venture. The reason for this is threefold. First,
the goals of the VC and entrepreneur will likely become aligned thereby mitigating the
potential agency problem. Second, after deciding to invest in the new venture, the VC is
likely to change from being a wary investor to a willing collaborator (Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984; Sapienza, 1992). Third, the founding entrepreneur remains a substantial legal
owner, albeit at a reduced percentage, while maintaining strong individual-specific investments in the venture he or she has founded. Even after VCs become investors in a venture,
entrepreneurs generally retain significant interest and therefore remain significant principals even though the percentage of ownership tends to decline with further rounds of
VC financing. If entrepreneurs were to engage in behaviors to take advantage of VCs,
they would harm their own long-term financial position by increasing the likelihood of
venture failure. The cost of venture failure would likely hurt the entrepreneur much more
than the invested VC.
The above arguments concerning agency theory revolve around the theory’s primary
concern with instituting governance mechanisms to safeguard the principals’ investments
from shirking-type behavior. The focus of agency theory on protection against down-side
risk, in our opinion, helps clarify in an overall sense why it so often fails to capture phenomena in the VC-E relationship. Entrepreneurship is almost always about the pursuit of
upside potential and much less about downside protection. The upside potential specified
by agency theory is limited because an agent (entrepreneur) is supposed to have little
concern for the long-term success and direction of the venture unless properly motivated
by the principal. However, an entrepreneur is highly likely to be very concerned with the
long-term success and direction of the venture even after ceding a portion of the ownership to a VC. Indeed, entrepreneurs generally engage a VC for funding in order to maximize the long-term success of the venture. While the entrepreneur would be concerned
with his or her fiduciary responsibility to those providing funding, it is highly unlikely
that the entrepreneur would completely subordinate his or her vision for the venture to
the VC. Agency theory logic does not recognize that those involved with an entrepreneurial venture are almost always primarily concerned with its upside potential.
In sum, it has been argued that an entrepreneur will rarely act like an agent described
by agency theory. The venture’s success is uncertain and so the entrepreneur is highly
unlikely to pursue a short-term (and much lower) gain at the expense of the venture’s
Winter, 2003

<-----Page 9----->long-term success. Agency theory’s description of an agent, (e.g., an entrepreneur), as
one who is potentially verging on malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance for the
attainment of some short-term gain, is generally not indicative of entrepreneurs and their
intimate involvement with the ventures they have founded. Consequently, agency theory’s
description of an entrepreneur (agent) renders it unsatisfactory for accurately explaining
many of the behaviors in the VC-E relationship after the VC invests in the new venture.

Stewardship Theory as an Alternative in VC-E Relations
With the theoretical and empirical limitations of agency theory in explaining the VCE relationship now becoming clearer, stewardship theory is probed to determine whether
it could provide greater explanatory power for the VC-E relationship. Several articles
have recently offered stewardship theory as the antithetical counter to agency theory (e.g.,
Fox & Hamilton, 1994; Davis et al., 1997). Our purpose was to fill in the gaps left by
agency theory and find a theoretical foundation that could better explain the VC-E relationship when the entrepreneur and venture capitalists’ goals were in alignment. After all,
goal alignment between the two is a logical assumption after the VC has decided to invest
in the new venture. With its roots in sociology and psychology, stewardship theory characterizes human beings as having higher-order needs for self-esteem, self-actualization,
growth, achievement and affiliation. This is in contrast to agency theory’s characterization of human beings as opportunistic, inherently untrustworthy, and focused on a narrow
pursuit of financial gains. Davis and colleagues (1997) used McGregor’s Theory X and
Theory Y (McGregor, 1960) to represent two different “models of man” that support
agency theory and stewardship theory respectively. Instead of betraying the principal,
stewardship theory suggests that the steward’s behavior is organization centered, seeking
to improve organizational performance by satisfying the principals.2 In essence, stewardship theory is centrally concerned with identifying the situations in which the interests of the principal and the steward are aligned. The steward’s utility is maximized when
his or her goals are aligned with those of the principal and other stakeholders and thus
stewardship theory relegates itself to explaining behaviors in the upper left quadrant of
the 2 ¥ 2 matrix in Figure 1. By default, then, stewardship theory has no ability to explain
behaviors before the VC has decided to invest in the new venture because goals are not
aligned at that point. That is, before investing in the new venture, the VC’s goal is to
avoid a bad investment decision, whereas the entrepreneur’s goal is venture success (or
it is unknown).
Unfortunately, stewardship theory provides little help in shedding theoretical light on
the VC-E relationship even when goals are aligned. Although some of the factors concerning the “model of man,” such as identification and cultural differences are insightful
(cf. Davis et al., 1997), other assumptions generally lack explanatory power for the entrepreneurship context. One problem with the application of stewardship theory for the VCE relationship is that attention is still focused on aligning the interests of the steward
(entrepreneur) with the principal (VC). For example, “Although agency theory addresses
manager-principal interest divergence, additional theory is needed to explain what, if

2. Those writing about stewardship theory are typically concerned with all stakeholders. However, given the
focus of this article on the VC-E relationship, and for the sake of parsimony in our comparison of agency
theory and stewardship theory, we will refer to stakeholders as principals or VCs.

theory is better suited to answer what causes interests to be aligned because it recognizes
that agents and principals are inherently self-interested and that their interests may not
be aligned in the first place. It is this self-interest that may result in behaviors on the part
of the agent that are contrary to what the owner would prefer from the agent. Stewardship theory argues that individuals can “turn off” self-interest. For example, “stewardship theory defines situations in which managers are not motivated by individual goals,
but rather are stewards whose motives are aligned with the objectives of their principals”
(Davis et al., 1997, p. 21). It is likely that the entrepreneur’s prevailing concern or interest is the success of the venture that he or she has founded. If the entrepreneur is primarily concerned with venture success, it would not be in the best interest of the venture
(and VCs) for the entrepreneur to “turn off” his or her self-interest.
While agency theory paints a gloomy picture of the agent, stewardship theory paints
an excessively rosy picture of the steward. In short, the same problem of agency theory
in explaining VC-E behaviors plagues stewardship theory. That is, an entrepreneur will
generally not act like the steward portrayed by stewardship theory or like the agent portrayed by agency theory. Again, it seems that the entrepreneur will maintain a strong
attachment and psychological ownership (Pierce et al., 2001) toward the venture even
after ceding a portion of ownership to the VC. The entrepreneur will remain an owner
and will act like an owner after the VC invests in the new venture. As such, the entrepreneur will not likely subordinate his or her interests to those of the VC. Because the
VC is “signing on” to the organization after investing in the new venture, he or she is in
essence buying into an idea and vision established by the entrepreneur. This process
results in goal congruence between the two in that they both want the venture to succeed.
Cyert and March (1963) also argue that there is likely to be agreement on the goals of
the organization but also a potential for latent conflict. The VC may not always agree
with how the entrepreneur wants to run the business, but we suggest these differences
will be primarily the result of good-faith disagreements and not some sort of selfinterest, evidencing moral hazard on the part of the entrepreneur (Bruton et al., 2000).

Foundations for a New Paradigm
The fundamental logic of agency theory and stewardship theory and their focus and
prescriptions to preserve the wealth of investors tends to provide an incomplete and to
some extent inaccurate picture of the entrepreneur and to a lesser extent the VC. The
above analysis suggests that a great deal more theoretical work is needed to accurately
explain the VC-E relationship. More specifically, we believe that turning the focus away
from the entrepreneur is counterproductive to the development of good theory for entrepreneurship research. This focus runs counter to entrepreneurship research where the individual entrepreneur is increasingly being seen as a cornerstone in the development
of new opportunities and the founding process (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000). The VC literature has often drawn attention to the centrality of the
entrepreneur and the founding team (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Furthermore, the VC
literature frequently highlights the importance of the quality of the founding entrepreneurs in the funding decision (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998).
In essence, exploring entrepreneurship-related phenomena frequently starts with the
founder. Failure to integrate the individual perspectives severely limits the explanatory
power of any theory for entrepreneurship, particularly when the motives and capabilities

Winter, 2003

155

<-----Page 11----->of the entrepreneur are ignored. More specifically, agency theory and stewardship theory
draw attention away from the entrepreneur and toward the VC. Given the critical importance of the founding team to a venture, it is becoming increasingly evident that new
theory that specifically considers the centrality of the entrepreneur in the VC-E relationship is needed.
In reality, it appears that the VC’s contribution to the VC-E relationship is not solely
financial (Steier & Greenwood, 1995; Busenitz et al., 1999). Yet, agency theory prescribes
actions that focus on the protection of the investment of the principal (VC) against the
harmful behaviors of the agent (entrepreneur). Similarly stewardship theory prescribes
actions that would result in the principal (VC) obtaining the same performance by using
a steward that the principal would have gotten had the principal run the business himself
or herself. Neither theory addresses the upside that an entrepreneur can offer for the
venture and neither theory can explain the relational rents that are possible through the
VC-E relationship (De Clercq & Sapienza, 2000; 2001).
Given the limitations of agency theory and the inadequacy of stewardship theory for
explaining the VC-E relationship, better theory is needed for understanding this important relationship. While developing new theory goes beyond the scope of this article, we
develop some foundational issues that future theory needs to address if the dynamics of
the VC-E relationship are to be more accurately explained. More specifically, we discuss
three issues that appear to be central in the VC-E relationship.

Beyond Separation of Ownership and Management
Agency theory as a central paradigm for understanding capital markets, firm valuation, and the implications of the separation of financial ownership and control (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976) emerged as a viable choice in the search for a paradigm to explain the
VC-E relationship. VCs are clearly outside owners who often play an active roll in overseeing the entrepreneurs and the strategic decisions of a funded venture. Consistent with
the above analysis, agency theory does indeed appear to have some explanatory value
concerning behaviors within the VC-E relationship, particularly in the initial stages of
the VC-E relationship. A critical issue that significantly limits agency theory’s relevance
to the VC-E relationship after the VC investment is made, is the assumption that goals
between the VC and entrepreneur are necessarily divergent and that the entrepreneur
must be induced and monitored to act in ways that will lead to venture success and preservation of the VC’s wealth. This inaccurately portrays entrepreneurs as potential thieves
or deadbeats and portrays VCs as police officers enforcing the law. If future research
examines the VC-E relationship from an agency perspective, consideration needs to be
given in more accurately portraying the nature of the relationship. Instead of focusing
solely on a principal/agent relationship in which VC involvement is seen as a way to
monitor entrepreneurs, researchers will need to account for the trust developed in the
relationship and will need to view VC involvement as a form of collaboration to grow
the venture.

Beyond Just Financial Ownership
Future theory development also needs to address the fact that ownership of entrepreneurial ventures involves more than just financial ownership (Pierce et al., 2001; Steier
& Greenwood, 1995). Again, agency theory tends to point toward ownership percentages, contractual obligations, and the rights of external financial owners versus internal
managers. Conceptualizations of the VC-E relationship using agency theory have usually
156

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->minimized the individual perspective of entrepreneurs and how they think. This static
view imposed on the VC-E relationship through the agency lens has tended to put a veil
over the richer dynamics of this critical relationship.
Since levels of financial ownership apparently have little effect (Sapienza & Gupta,
1994; Busenitz et al., 2001), perhaps future research should probe the investment of self
that virtually all entrepreneurs make in the ventures they found. The entrepreneurs by
definition are the ones who have founded the venture and have invested a large amount
of sweat equity generally long before VCs get involved. While entrepreneurs progressively give up a portion of the ownership of a venture in exchange for additional rounds
of VC funding, they are still likely to feel that the venture is “their venture” or “their
baby.” After launching the business and getting it through some of the early stages, the
entrepreneur realizes that more resources are needed to fully develop the venture. After
first round funding, VCs may now own 40% of the venture and the entrepreneur 60%.
But does the entrepreneur really view his or her ownership as just 60%? We suspect not.
Taking into consideration the non-financial investments of time, energy, and sweat equity
that the entrepreneur has already made, it is likely that the entrepreneur will view his or
her ownership level as something greater, creating what we refer to as the “ownership
plus” mentality. Furthermore, buy-back arrangements in the contracts with VCs will
usually leave entrepreneurs with the hope that their ownership stake will rise if the
venture reaches certain targets. These issues should frequently leave the entrepreneur
thinking in terms of a higher ownership stake.
The non-financial contributions and sweat equity invested in a venture by the founder
are clearly a non-trivial component of the overall ownership that an entrepreneur is likely
to have or perceive toward the venture. This ownership plus perspective has several
important implications. First, positively, the more psychological ownership that the entrepreneur has over and above his or her legal ownership, the more likely the entrepreneur
will continue to offer large amounts of sweat equity to the venture. This has implications
for valuing ventures higher due to their “entrepreneurial assets.” This is in contrast to
valuing corporations lower due to their agency costs (Jensen & Meckling, 1976).
Second, the ownership plus perspective has implications for the VC-E relationship
and the extent to which VCs are encouraged to become involved in the venture beyond
their financial investment. If the entrepreneur’s ownership plus is very high, VC nonfinancial contribution and participation in the venture may not be needed or well received.
In light of this, it may become critical for VCs to offer their business advice and counseling in such a manner that the entrepreneurs feel like they are being treated in a procedurally fair manner (Busenitz et al., 1999; Korsgaard et al., 1995). Without this
perception of procedural justice/fairness in their relationship with the VCs, entrepreneurs
are likely to feel as though they are being preyed upon or that the VCs really do not
understand the business. The VC-based agency theory literature has tended to focus attention on VCs, the protection of their investments, and their newfound influence in monitoring the venture. All of these agency issues essentially focus on downside protection.
Furthermore, the current literature by default appears to relegate the entrepreneur to the
back seat once VCs make their initial investments.
In light of the above discussion, it would seem that future research should attempt
to more explicitly develop theoretical frameworks that integrate the upside potential of
these high-growth potential ventures. Procedural justice theory is one perspective that
has good potential to further explain and inform this relationship (Sapienza & Korsgaard,
1996; Busenitz et al., 1997). Procedural justice logic would suggest that when entrepreneurs are treated in a procedurally fair manner by their VCs, such as by giving them their
fair say and by respecting their skills and insights, entrepreneurs will in all likelihood
Winter, 2003

157

<-----Page 13----->continue to invest their sweat equity in the venture. Even though their actual ownership
percentage becomes diluted with each round of funding, entrepreneurs are likely to act
in a manner that is more consistent with full ownership when they are treated in a procedurally fair manner. Given that entrepreneurs often embody firm-specific skills and
capabilities that are potential sources of competitive advantage (Alvarez & Busenitz,
2001), a venture is much more likely to reach its fuller potential if the entrepreneurs are
treated fairly.

The Centrality of the Entrepreneur
Agency theory supports the perspective that the firm (new venture in this case) is a
legal entity that essentially serves as a nexus of contracts among various resources and
factors of production (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The above arguments add to earlier
research that recognizes the limitations of agency theory in the business angel/entrepreneur relationship (Kelly & Hay, 2001; Landstrom, 1992; van Osnabrugge, 2000). While
agency theory and contracts in the entrepreneurial venture are of some assistance in
understanding why VC firms exist (Amit et al., 1998), the dynamics inside the entrepreneurial firm have only begun to be tapped. In going beyond viewing the venture as a
nexus of contracts, it seems that it could be beneficial to view the venture as an extension of the individuals involved.
Focusing attention on the individual entrepreneur and the unique resources that he
or she brings to a venture has provided significant progress in understanding how entrepreneurs think and make strategic decisions (Baron, 1998; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). If
entrepreneurs do indeed have a unique cognitive structure, then it follows that they have
the potential to generate a competitive advantage. Alvarez and Busenitz (2001) noted that
one of these advantages may be in the recognition of new opportunities. The cognitive
ability of entrepreneurs enables them to more readily make sense out of uncertain and
complex environments that baffle most others. Their knowledge structures enable them
to cut through massive amounts of information and chaos to see a pattern and a potential opportunity. In sum, it appears that those with an entrepreneurial cognition can gain
a competitive advantage by learning more quickly and by making faster decisions that
nicely facilitate the development of new opportunities. An entrepreneurial cognition facilitates a unique decision-making style that is particularly beneficial to a venture in the
initial stages of venture development. This cognition or knowledge structure enables
entrepreneurs to “readily navigate through a wide array of problems and irregularities
inherent in the development of new firms” (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001, p. 759).
If there is to be application of stewardship theory research to the VC-E relationship,
we suggest that the focus shift toward the entrepreneur and his or her vision for the
venture. Most research on the VC-E relationship seems to implicitly assume that VCs
become the point-of-focus and superordinate once they choose to invest. Given the set
of unique resources and capabilities that an entrepreneur possesses, it seems that the VC
should focus on maintaining, developing and leveraging the entrepreneur’s unique inputs
to the venture. In the context of the VC-E relationship, the question then becomes, “How
can VCs promote the entrepreneur’s full application of his or her resources and abilities
in the venture which he or she has founded?” Since entrepreneurs have an enduring
impact on the firms that they create (Schein, 1983; Bamford et al., 1999), it would seem
that capitalizing on their individual-specific resources may well represent a potential
source of competitive advantage.
Researchers have taken different positions in regard to VCs actually adding value to
ventures with their non-financial assistance (e.g., Sapienza, 1992; Steier & Greenwood,
158

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->1995). While research findings are mixed, the above analysis suggests another way of
viewing the VC-E relationship. We suggest that VC input be examined from a complementary perspective. The VC should perhaps first consider the strengths and weaknesses
of the entrepreneur and then seek to provide inputs that exploit those strengths and mitigate weaknesses. Most of the literature on VC input discusses the VC’s role in offering
help in strategic planning or generating needed links to key suppliers or customers.
Instead of focusing on the possible value that VCs may provide as strategic planners or
nodes of communication, viewing the VC-E relationship in a complementary manner may
prove to be more productive. This would involve matching the strengths and weaknesses
of the entrepreneur in a complementary manner with the strengths and weaknesses of the
VC. This position assumes that VCs are also unique and are likely to have varied
resources, some of which have the potential to be valuable, rare and difficult to imitate
(Barney, 1991). Failure to account for the uniqueness of entrepreneurs and VCs is highly
likely to diminish the potential for the establishment of a competitive advantage through
the combined skills and abilities of those in the VC-E relationship. Indeed, the failure to
integrate and complement the capabilities of entrepreneurs by the VC team may increase
the chances of the venture incurring a competitive disadvantage.
Finally, because of the embeddedness of the entrepreneur within the venture he or
she has created, we suggest that without careful consideration of who the entrepreneur
is, understanding and accurately explaining the VC-E relationship will not be possible.
A common assertion among VCs is that it can be very legitimate to fund a “B” level idea
as long as it is being championed by an “A” level entrepreneurial team (Bygrave &
Timmons, 1992). While one could debate the ranking of entrepreneurs and their ideas, a
more fruitful line of questioning may be to ask how an entrepreneur’s influence within
the venture attenuates over time. Furthermore, is the influence of VCs in a new venture
vitiating, additive, or multiplicative?

Conclusion
This article has carefully examined VC-E research that used agency theory as its
theoretical foundation. Our analysis suggests that agency theory still has relevance to
the VC-E relationship but that its explanatory power is strongest in the pre-funding era.
Although stewardship theory has been recently juxtaposed as an alternative to agency
theory, our analysis casts doubts on stewardship theory as an effective lens through which
we can further probe the VC-E relationship.
We suspect that a solid theoretical foundation for the VC-E relationship has yet to
be laid. With the goal of charting some new directions for this critical relationship, we
discussed three key gaps and issues that show promise for future theoretical work. First,
we argued that the nature of the relationship should be more accurately articulated by
assuming goal congruence and the development of trust after the VC has decided to invest
in the new venture. Second, we suggested that future work consider entrepreneurs as
much more than partial financial owners after VCs invest; it is important to account for
their psychological ownership because they often think and act like owners beyond
what their financial equity position would suggest. We refer to this as ownership plus.
Finally, we argued that the venture is really an extension of the individual entrepreneurs
and the unique resources that lead them to found their ventures. Without better theoretical consideration of the entrepreneur within the VC-E relationship, we suspect that the
explanatory power of theory surrounding this critical relationship will be unnecessarily
restricted.
