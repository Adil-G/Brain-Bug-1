This paper investigates the structure of outside investment in a profitable entrepreneurial
venture. Though efficient, financing the venture up front may be infeasible because the entrepreneur cannot commit to not renegotiate down the outside investor's claim once she's sunk her
investment. Staging the investment over time helps to mitigate this commitment problem. The
early rounds of investment create collateral that support the later rounds. We characterize the
optimal staged investment path and show how it is affected by various features of the venture.
The predictions of the model are consistent with observations on staged financing in venture
capital.

1. INTRODUCTION
The fact that entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints is well documented (Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994a, 1994b)). This paper investigates
one source of such constraints, and how they may be mitigated by the structure of investment into entrepreneurial ventures. Our focus is on the use of staged financing to overcome a commitment problem that arises in entrepreneurialfinance due to the critical role
that the entrepreneur himself plays in determining the success of the venture.
To illustrate, consider an entrepreneurial venture that is efficiently financed if K dollars are provided up front to purchase physical assets which are then used by the entrepreneur for one period. After this period the venture returns sK with certainty, where s is
large enough to ensure that the initial investment was profitable. When the entrepreneur
is cash constrained, it would seem that an outside investor's participation can be ensured
via a claim of at least K dollars against the venture's return. However, this simple solution
may not be feasible for the reasons explored by Hart and Moore (1994) in their analysis
of debt contracts: the claim offered the investor may not be credible as the entrepreneur
cannot commit not to renegotiate the investor's claim after the investor has sunk her K
dollars investment, but before the entrepreneur has completed his work. If the outcome
of the renegotiation leaves the investor with a claim of less than K, then she would ex
ante not be willing to finance the venture.
Now imagine that the venture could be financed by investing half of the needed
amount (K/2) up front, and the other half after one period. If the entrepreneurworks with
the physical assets purchased with both rounds of investment, then the venture returns sK
after two periods. The initial investment by the investor is now smaller, hence the investor's ensuing claim is less susceptible to being renegotiated down in the venture's first
period. The venture can also build up collateral, through the entrepreneur's work with
the first round of investment, that can be used to protect the investor's claim from being
renegotiated down in the second period. Staging the financing thus helps to mitigate this
255

commitment and renegotiation problem, and may therefore facilitate the funding of ventures that could not be funded under "up-front" financing.
The main result of this paper is the derivation of the optimal staged investment path
in the face of this commitment, or hold-up, problem. We also examine how the venture's
profitability, the tangibility of the venture's physical assets, and the entrepreneur's wealth
affect the form of the optimal investment path, and the question of whether a given
venture can be financed at all. The predictions of our model are found to be broadly
consistent with recent empirical studies on the financing of ventures in the venture capital
market (Sahlman (1990), Gompers (1992, 1995), Lerner (1992)). Of most importance is
the almost universal use of staged financing by venture capitalists. As noted by Sahlman
(1990): "The most important mechanism for controlling the venture [by the venture capitalist] is staging the infusion of capital".
The commitment problem that motives the use of staging comes from our perspective
on the important role of the entrepreneur:in a given venture the entrepreneur has unique
human capital that is critical to achieving the venture's full potential. However, the
entrepreneur cannot be contractually bound to work. In the words of Hart and Moore
(1994), his human capital is "inalienable". The entrepreneur always retains the right to
repudiate the contract with the investor and exit the venture.1 As in Hart and Moore's
(1994) work on debt contracts, we suppose that upon repudiation of the investor's claim
by the entrepreneur the physical assets of the venture revert to the investor. If these assets
have little value without the entrepreneur in place (investment is largely sunk), then the
entrepreneur retains bargaining power in the subsequent negotiations over claims to the
venture's return (earned if the entrepreneur returns to work). The resolution of the bargaining may leave the investor with a much diminished claim, hence it is in this sense that
the entrepreneur can "hold-up" the investor after the investor has made her investment.2
Staging the financing reduces the possibility of hold-up through our view of how the
venture evolves. Over the life of the venture what begins as part of the human capital of
the entrepreneur (and hence inalienable), gradually becomes embodied in the physical
capital of the venture (and hence alienable). The value of the venture's physical assets
without the entrepreneur in place (the venture's collateral value) therefore grows over
time. When investment into the venture is staged, this collateral can support the later
rounds of outside investment. The venture's early rounds of investment are also safe from
hold-up if they are small enough so that the claims held by the outside investor cannot
be bid down further.
Our model is one of perfect certainty. Other works on the staging of investment in
venture capital have taken a "real option" view of staging that revolves around the generic
problem of investing under uncertainty (Gompers (1992), Hellman (1993), Sahlman (1988,
1990)).3 In these models the value of staging investment is the option value of waiting to
invest, rather than the outcome of the agency problem that exists between the entrepreneur
and the venture capitalist. The real option model of staging and the model presented
here share some interesting similarities (and predictions), but fundamentally they address
1. Note that venture capital contracts between the venture capitalist and entrepreneur often contain
elements that try to bind the entrepreneur to the venture. These include noncompete clauses and vesting schedules that penalize entrepreneurs if they leave the venture early (Sahlman (1990)). These contractual elements can
only affect the outside option of the entrepreneur. They cannot affect the fundamental issue addressed here,
which is the value that the entrepreneur has within the venture.
2. For further discussion of these issues, and related literature on the noncontractibility of human capital,
see Neher (1996).
3. The role of staging has also been investigated in a more general real option framework (not directly
based on venture capital) by Roberts and Weitzman (1981).

different although parallel concerns in venture capital finance. The parallels (and divergences) between these models are discussed in some detail in Section 6.
Our model is also one of symmetric information. The staging of investment has been
discussed as solving an agency problem revolving around asymmetric information in
Gompers (1992, 1995). In Gompers (1992) the venture capitalist chooses to stage the
financing in an entrepreneurial project to ensure that she can stop the entrepreneur from
pouring money into a project that is doomed to fail. The venture capitalist cannot observe
whether the project has "become" a failure without bearing a monitoring cost, hence the
choice of stages balances this monitoring cost with the benefit of being able to observe
and discontinue funding of a failed venture. This perspective is also discussed in more
general terms to motivate the empirical analysis of Gompers (1995). These papers and
ours share an agency perspective on staged investment; however, Gompers' focus is on
the role of staging as a form of monitoring, whereas we focus on staging as a reaction to
the growth in a venture's ability to take on outside finance due to a diminishing hold-up
problem.
Asymmetric information is also at the core of the model explored in Admati and
Pfleiderer (1994). They too investigate the financing of an entrepreneurial venture in
stages, but they are interested in analysing the role of the venture capitalist as a financial
intermediary who can resolve informational asymmetries between the entrepreneur and
the capital markets. Staging is not an endogenous feature of their model. Neither is it an
endogenous feature of the financial contracting models of Neher (1996), and Bolton and
Scharfstein (1990). These papers address contracting issues that surround staged financing,
but do not address the process of staging itself.
Finally, the model presented here is related in spirit to Admati and Perry (1991).
They too study the role of staged investment in overcoming a commitment problem. In
their model, two like players alternate in making sunk contributions to a joint project
that gives each of them a private benefit when the total contributions exceed a certain
level. An inability to commit to make future contributions, on the part of both players,
creates a free rider problem because each player would like to free-ride on the other
player's contribution. Similar to the effects of the entrepreneur's commitment problem in
our model, the free-rider problem constrains the level of contributions that each player is
willing to make and some socially desirable projects must go unfunded. There is no collateral in their model. However, Admati and Perry derive a result reminiscent of ours by
showing that when the players' disutilities from contributions functions are convex, some
projects may be financed in equilibrium by the players alternating making small (relative
to first best) contributions (a form of staged investment).
The paper is organized as follows. The model is set out in Section 2. In Section 3 we
outline and solve the bargaining game that follows a repudiation by the entrepreneur. The
analysis of the bargaining game is quite rich, and of some independent interest. In Section
4 we analyse the determination of the optimal investment path. Here we address the
question of whether a given venture can be financed at all, and if so what the form of the
optimal investment path is. In Section 5 we briefly explore some comparative statics and
some simple extensions to the model. In Section 6 we discuss the model's predictions in
light of recent empirical work on the venture capital industry, the relationship between our
model's predictions and those of a real option model of staged financing, and conclude.
2. THE MODEL
We study the problem facing an entrepreneur who needs to raise capital to finance a new
project, or venture. We assume that the entrepreneur has no wealth (this assumption is

<-----Page 4----->258

discussed in Section 5 below) and therefore must turn to an outside investor or venture
capitalist. We assume a competitive supply of deep-pocketed venture capitalists, hence the
entrepreneur simply needs to offer an investment contract that allows any one investor to
break even. The venture that we consider bears a return after investments of both physical
and human capital. Physical capital investment comes in the form of an investment path,
II, I2, . . ., IT. Both the size of each investment (Ii), and the number of rounds of investment (T) are determined endogenously. We assume that each round of investment corresponds to a single period of the venture. Investment is assumed to come at the beginning
of the period, and each period is of fixed and equal length with a common per period
discount factor, ,B. We put no restrictions on the allowable path other than an upper
bound on its scale. The total amount of physical capital investment into the venture
cannot exceed K, so that i=TIi- K. We further assume that once the investment path has
been chosen and investment has begun, the nature of the path remains fixed. We do not
allow the dimensions of the path to be changed midway through the venture.4
Human capital investment comes uniquely from the entrepreneur. He makes this
investment simply by working with the physical capital that is provided in each round.
There is assumed to be no effort cost on the part of the entrepreneur (see note 5 below).
If all physical capital investment is made, and the entrepreneurworks with the capital
for all T periods, the venture returns R = s yT I Ii after the T-th period. We call the return
to the maximum scale of the venture RM, where sK = RM. The venture is assumed to
generate no returns other than those provided at completion. Because our focus is the
endogenous determination of the path of investment into the venture, we assume this
simple structure of returns out of the venture. However, the venture may be terminated
early, in which case it provides a return based on the outside value of the assets in place
at termination. This outside value is the value of the venture without the entrepreneur's
human capital. We call this early termination "liquidation", and if liquidation occurs in
period i the venture immediately returns Li. This liquidation value of the venture's assets
could be their resale, or scrap value, or simply the value that the assets have under the
control of someone other than the entrepreneur. We also assume that the entrepreneur
has no opportunities for income outside that provided by the return from the venture.
The determination of how the venture's liquidation value evolves over the life of the
venture captures our concept of how the human capital of the entrepreneur gradually
becomes embodied in the venture's physical capital. We assume that any physical capital
investment is sunk before it has had its full period with the entrepreneur (this is weakened
in Section 5 below). Once the investment has had its period with the entrepreneur it gains
transferable or liquidation value at the venture's return rate s. Thus the liquidation value
+ Ii) = Li+ 1. Note that the investment Ii1+ is not
of the venture in period i + 1 is s(Il ?
included in Li+, . This round of investment has zero outside value until the entrepreneur
completes round i + 1. Furthermore, we are implicitly assuming that growth in the venture's liquidation value comes solely from new investment. This assumption is weakened
in Section 5. The timing of the model is illustrated in Figure 1.
In every period i the venture could be liquidated for Li, or continued, where continuation means that the entrepreneur stays with the venture, and there is further capital
investment (Ii+ 1, Ii+2,...).
Continuation also requires that the current physical assets
remain in place. The choice to liquidate is a permanent end to the venture. The venture
cannot be liquidated and then started over (this is perhaps most consistent with the view

4. As our model takes place with perfect information and no uncertainty this assumption is quite unrestrictive. It simply allows us to simplify the renegotiation process described below.

A criticalfeatureof the model'sstructureis that thereis an efficiencycost to financing

structure of investment, staged financing leads to a costly delay in realizing this return.5

worksfor a penod, thenthe venture
For exampleif A = K is investedand the entrepreneur
returnssK= Rm after this first period (to focus our analysis on potentiallyprofitable
ventureswe will requirethe conditionthat s > 1/fl). The net returnto this singleinvestment "path" is greater than the net return to any multiple investmentpath where
xT L - K and the venturereturnsRm afterthe T-thperiod(thisconclusionfollowsfrom
the equal lengh of the venture'speriods of any path).6 Note that this conclusionalso
holds trueif the returnfromthe multipleinvestmentpath is generatedby earlyliquidation
ratherthan completion.
Though up-front financing is preferredon efficiency grounds, the entrepreneur
(henceforthknown as E) may not be able to crediblyoffer the venturecapitalist(henceforth known as V) a large enough claim against the returngeneratedby a one period
ventureto coverher investment.This is due to our assumptionthat E is unableto commit
not to repudiatethe investmentcontractwith V by removinghis valuablehumancapital
fromthe venture.As in Hartand Moore(1994)we assumethat E alwaysretainsthis right
to repudiate,and thereforecan do so in any periodof the venture.FollowingHart and
Moore we furtherassumethat the worst penaltythat can be assessedE is that control
over the physical assets of the ventureare transferredto V. No other penalty can be
exacted(V cannot have accessto E's personalbelongings,nor have E jailed). This also
implies that any money that E may have borrowed beyond that invested in the venture is
similarly untouchable.
In light of this structure we consider the following type of investment contract
betweenE and V. V agreesto provideall rounds of investmentin the investmentpath

P). E agreesto work on the venture for all T periods and receivesthe residualclaim
5. Note that introducing an efrort cost for the entrepreneuralso creates another "cost" to staged financing
(the entrepreneur would have to work more periods). This cost bome by the entrepreneur could potentially
interact with his incentives to engage in hold-up, and hence affect the determination of the equilibrium investment path. This is an interesting avenue for future research.
6. Note that the assumption that periods are of fixed and equal length, rather than perhaps depending on
the level of the period's investment, is not crucial to drawing this conclusion. it simply makes net present value
calculations more tractable without qualitatively affecting the analysis. Similarly note that other ways to consider
the efects of the staging process will lead to the same qualitative conclusions as our model if this efficiency cost
to staging the investment is maintaine. For exampe, this would be the case in a model where the costs of staging
came not specifcally fron delay, but from a reduced return to later investments relative to early investments.

against the venture's final return (R - P0). If E repudiates the contract in any period of
the venture (for example i), control over the physical assets is passed to V. E and V can
then negotiate a new contract, or V can simply liquidate the assets for Li. If a new contract
is agreed to, we assume that E is given back control over the venture, and that the venture
starts up at the same place it left off when E repudiated. V continues to provide investment, in return for her new claim on the venture's return (call this Pi). Note that we do
not explicitly model V's claim against any early liquidation proceeds. We assume that any
early liquidation must have followed a repudiation by E, hence V has control over the
venture's physical assets and an implicit claim for their total value.
The above formulation implicitly assumes that V cannot initiate renegotiation by, for
example, refusing to input an agreed-upon round of investment. This assumption may
seem restrictive because allowing V to initiate renegotiation could possibly help to
counteract the effects of E's right to repudiate and renegotiate, hence could possibly help
to get the venture financed more efficiently. However, as Propositions 2 and 3 will illustrate, the optimal investment path has the feature that V's initial claim on the venture's
return (P0) equals her post-renegotiation claim (Pi) for renegotiation in every period.
Therefore along an optimal investment path there is no scope for V to better her claim
through initiating renegotiation. For ease of exposition we thus restrict to E the right to
initiate renegotiation.7
We can consider contracts with the given structure without loss of generality because
they give V the maximum possible protection against E's inability to commit not to
repudiate and renegotiate. E therefore faces the problem of designing an investment path
that maximizes the venture's net present value and allows the venture to be feasibly
financed under a break even contract of the above form. Feasibility is governed by the
commitment, or hold-up, problem, which in turn is characterized by the outcome of the
renegotiation process that follows a repudiation by the entrepreneur in any period of the
chosen investment path.
3. RENEGOTIATION
Following E's repudiation of the investment contract, V gains control over the venture's
physical assets. We characterize the division of bargaining power in the subsequent
renegotiation by assuming that bargaining power is connected to the control of capital.
Both E and V consequently have some bargaining power as V has control over the physical capital, while E retains control over his human capital. We therefore structure their
bargaining over the surplus available from continuing the venture along the lines of the
strategic bargaining model studied by Binmore, Shaked and Sutton (1989), and Osborne
and Rubinstein (1990). The players make alternating offers, and V can only pursue her
outside option (liquidation of the physical assets) in response to an offer by E. We assume
that E makes the first offer, and that the alternating offers take place in small periods of
length A, therefore with an associated common discount factor 3= /3'. The outcome of
bargaining will be either the liquidation of the venture's assets, or the resumption of the
venture under a new contract.
7. Note that this discussion assumes that renegotiation forced by V is done under the same terms as
renegotiation forced by E. In fact it is likely that V's bargaining power would actually be less in the former
situation because E would still control the venture, whereas in the latter situation control over the venture's
physical assets have been passed over to V. Thus, the need to consider the possibility of V-induced renegotiation
is even weaker. Furthermore, if E can draw upon the competitive supply of investors to step in and make a
round of investment that V has threatened not to make, then V has no bargaining power in the renegotiations.
In this case V has no incentive to attempt to force renegotiation.

We denote the present value to V of the outcome of renegotiation in period i by ufv
If the venture resumes following the bargaining then this outcome is implemented via a
new contract with V's claim against R designated by Pi. Because our model is deterministic we can, without loss of generality, restrict our attention to contracts which are repudiation-proof (this is proven as part of the proof of Proposition 1 below). Therefore Pi will

(other paths should lead to a mutual agreement to abandon).
The intertemporal nature of the venture, and the possibility of renegotiation in any
period, makes the analysis of renegotiation in a given period quite rich (and of some
independent interest). The equilibrium outcome depends on the interaction between the
value of liquidation, the surplus value of continuation, and the constraint imposed by the
possibility of repudiation and renegotiation in any period between the current period and
the venture's end. This is best understood by first analysing the bargaining in period T,
and then working backwards period by period. In period T the value of continuing the
venture until the end is ST= PiR, and V has the "outside option" to liquidate the assets
for LT. The equilibrium and outcome of this alternating offers bargaining game is well
known. When A->0 (hence 3-- 1) E and V agree to "split the surplus", unless V's outside
option is greater, in which case V receives the value of her outside option and E receives
the residual. Agreement is immediate and the venture continues until the end (T+ 1) with

and PT

The bargaining game in period T- 1 is similar to the above, except for the need to
consider the effects of possible repudiation and renegotiation in period T on the bargaining in period T - 1. When bargaining over the surplus ST- I V needs to consider the
possibility that a large claim on R may be bid down through a repudiation by E in period
T. In fact there can be no credible claim on R larger than PT. In turn this constrains the
share of ST- 1 that can be credibly offered to V. It could be the case that this constraint
is so severe that V prefers immediate liquidation for LT-, even though it is efficient to
continue the venture until completion. Incorporating this constraint into the alternating
offers bargaining framework is not difficult. A complete analysis found in the appendix.
When A-0 (hence 3-- 1) the result of the bargaining can be characterized quite easily.

tract will not be repudiated and renegotiated in period T.
The outcome of the bargaining game in period i, where 1 -<i T- 2, is analysed similarly, except that the possibility of repudiation and renegotiation in all periods between i
and T needs to be considered. This can be quite easily done by defining the variable Qi
min {P i+1,... ,PT, R} for i, 1 i?j T. The variable Qi represents the largest claim on R
that can be credibly offered to V in the bargaining game in period i. Any larger claim
would be bid down in a subsequent period. The general counterpart to equation (1) is
established in the following proposition.

4. THE OPTIMAL INVESTMENT PATH
The threat of future repudiation, and the renegotiation outcome characterized in Proposition 1, governs the credibility of any investment contract initially offered to V. By
staging the investment the entrepreneur can create interim collateral which can help to
mitigate the repudiation threat. An example illustrates.
Example 4.1. Define a venture by K= 1, ,= 09, and s =2. Consider the possibility
of financing the venture at full scale in one period. V would have to be given a claim P0 =
1 11 against RM= 2 to provide the $1 investment. To see whether this claim is credible we
need to consider the outcome of E repudiating sometime in the first period. There is no
constraint due to the possibility of future repudiation, and LI = 0, and GI = 0, hence by
Proposition 1 Uv= ,BR/2 = $0 90, and PI = 1. The ex ante claim P 1 11 is therefore not
credible and the venture cannot be financed in one period. Consider now the possibility
of financing the venture via the investment path (II = $0.6, I2= $0 4). To provide these
investments V must be offered a claim P0 = 1 185 against RM= 2, which comes at T + 1 =
3. To determine whether this claim is credible we need to consider the outcome of E
repudiating in both the first and second periods. The analysis of renegotiation in the
second period is as above except that L2 =$1 20. By Proposition 1 U2V=L2 =$1 20, hence
P2= 1 33. E will therefore choose not to repudiate in the second period as the renegotiation leads to an increase in V's claim. Renegotiation following repudiation in the first
period needs to incorporate Ql =P2= 1 33, and GI =0 36. Again by Proposition 1
Uv= $0 63, hence P1 = 1 22. E will therefore choose not to repudiate in the first period.
As E will not repudiate in either period V's claim of P 1 185 is credible, and the venture
can be financed via the staged investment path.
To determine the optimal investment path we first establish conditions under which
any given investment path can be feasibly financed. Consider the investment path
{I1, .. , IT} which returns R. Feasibility implies that E must be able to offer V a credible
claim on R (PO) that covers her investments. As argued above our deterministic model
allows us to restrict our attention to repudiation-proof contracts, hence feasibility can be
captured by two conditions:
Po? min{P1,.

.

, PT},

p TPo> jET3B'11I

(3)

(4)

Note that by construction Pi:5R, hence P0 ?R (hence (4) also implies that the net return
to the venture is positive). We can restrict attention to equality in (4) as E only needs to
ensure that V breaks even on her investments.

<-----Page 9----->NEHER

STAGED FINANCING

263

It is useful to characterize (3) as a system of T "feasibility" inequalities, or constraints: Po0 P1, 1?i-<T. Each inequality represents the repudiation-proof constraint for
the given period of the venture. By using equality in (4) to establish PO,and the definition
of Pi established in Proposition 1, we can rewrite (3) as

,x B I. <5Ui,v

1- i -<T.

(5)

The system of inequalities in (5) simply recasts the feasibility constraints in terms of investments and the payoff to repudiation. The post-repudiation payoff to V in each period
must be great enough to cover her investments to date (suitably discounted). The following
proposition, which is proven in the appendix, establishes two features of an optimal investment path.
Proposition 2. Optimality requires that a feasible investmentpath satisfies thefollowing two conditions:
(a) UiV=Li, 2?-i-<?T,
(b) Yj

=

1=
p U-V,
I 2 <i -<T.

Condition (a) of Proposition 2 states that along an optimal investment path all
rounds of investment, save the first, are fully backed by the liquidation value of the venture's assets (the venture's collateral). A similar result cannot hold for the first period as
the venture has not yet built up any collateral (L1 = 0). The intuition for condition (a)
comes from the consideration of a feasible investment path that does not satisfy (a) for
some i, 2-<i-<T. Feasibility implies that 1'_ J-3I.? U!v, but Uiv is based either on the
surplus value of continuing the venture, or on a future period's repudiation. Neither of
these are affected if we consider adding I+ 1 to I;, hence constructing a new investment
path one period shorter. The new path remains feasible and delivers the return one period
sooner. Therefore the new path is preferred by E.
Condition (b) of Proposition 2 states that there cannot be any "slack" in the 2
through T feasibility constraints of an optimal investment path. When there is slack in
1
'I)<
I. U/', investment can be moved from an earlier
any constraint, for example
round to round i and the feasibility of the path can be maintained. Pushing investment to
the future means a lower present value for the investment path, which is again preferred
by E.
We can use Proposition 2 to generate candidates for the optimal investment path.
Conditions (a) and (b) of Proposition 2 imply that
Ii=LiL-'j_1'-PiIj,

2:5 i-<T.

(6)

Along an optimal investment path each round of investment beyond the first is made
equal to the debt capacity of the venture, or equal to the venture's total collateral value
minus the claims arising from previous investments. Condition (6) generates a unique
candidate for an optimal investment path for any given initial investment, II, and path
duration, T. It remains to determine the choice of II, the choice of T, and to determine
the overall feasibility of the candidate path constructed using I, T, and condition (6).
By construction the path generated by (6) satisfies the 2 through T feasibility constraints of condition (5). The feasibility of the overall path is therefore determined by the

<-----Page 10----->264

first feasibility constraint, I 5 U(v.This constraint can be simplified to
II?5SI /2,

(7)

by appealing to the definition of Ulv, and by noting that LI = 0 and by construction
p TQl - GI = I. An important observation to be made here is that the satisfaction (or not)
of condition (7) is divorced from the "scale" of the venture. To see this consider the T
period investment path dictated by condition (6) and I, = 1. Call this path (1, I2,.., IT),
which defines SI. Now consider the T period investment path dictated by condition (6)
and I, = k. Using condition (6) it is straightforward to establish that the new investment
path (k, Il, . .. ., IT) is simply k times the old, or I' = kIi for all i. Therefore S' = kS1 (as S1
is a linear combination of the investments). The satisfaction (or not) of condition (7) is
the same for both paths. This is a direct result of the constant returns to scale nature of
our venture.
The invariance of feasibility with respect to scale changes implies that we need only
consider investment paths that are at full scale, or
EJ1I=K.

(8)

Scaling up a feasible investment path also scales up the venture's surplus, hence full scale
is preferred by E. The condition that the venture operates at full scale allows us to
uniquely define II: for any given T and I, condition (6) uniquely defines the investment
path which can then be rescaled until condition (8) is satisfied. The following proposition,
which is proven in the appendix, summarizes the discussion of this section and defines the
optimal investment path.
Proposition 3. For a venturedefined by s, ,B,and K consider the candidate investment
paths given by (6) and (8) for all T> 0. If (7) is satisfiedfor any T the venturecan befeasibly
financed. If the venture can be feasibly financed then the optimal investmentpath is the
feasible candidatepath for which T is a minimum.
Proposition 3 is proven by analysing how the structure of the candidate investment
paths changes as T decreases. This is then compared to the increase in the present value of
the venture's return that arises due to the decreased completion time. The basic intuition is
that the venture's surplus is larger the faster the venture is completed. Fast completion
(when feasible) is therefore preferred by E. Note that Proposition 3 implies that when
sf3 2 the optimal financing of the venture will be in one round, or up-front (condition (7)
holds as S1/2 = (sIi )/2 -I,1). In this case the venture's return is high enough that staging
is not needed to protect V's claim.8 We illustrate the results of Proposition 3 (for sf3 < 2)
in Example 4.2 and Example 4.3.
Example 4.2. Consider a venture with the following characteristics:s = 1 5,
095,
K= 100. Take I, 1 and use (6) above to construct unscaled candidate investment paths.
The investment levels for periods 1 through 8 are shown in Figure 2.
8. This also implies that if staging creates no collateral, then the only way the venture can be financed is
if it is profitable for V to do it up-front. A related result is found in Lemma 4.1 of Admati and Perry (1991). In
their model (with no collateral) when the players have investment cost functions that are linear (as V's is) the
commitment problem cannot be overcome by staging the investment. The project can only go forward if one
player finds it profitable to complete the project in one round by himself.

Figure 2 shows us candidate paths for T = 1 through T = 8. We then use these same
investment levels to construct an S1/2, for each T, to address the question of feasibility
(via condition (7)). The path of these SI /2 is shown in Figure 3.
The first value of T for which I, = 1 ?S1/2 is 6, therefore the minimum number of
periods in which the venture can be feasibly financed is 6. By Proposition 3 the optimal

question of feasibility (via condition (7)). This path is shown in Figure 4. We can see that
this path never crosses the I, = 1 boundary, hence there is no way to feasibly finance this
venture.

defined venture from proceeding under up-front finance. Example 4.3 shows that even

under staged financing some profitable ventures are not feasibly financed. Note that the
defined venture in Example 4.3 would be profitable if financed up-front as sf > 1.
The optimal investment path found in Example 4.2 has the interesting property that
the second round of investment is smaller than the first, with the subsequent investments
monotonically increasing (this is illustrated, but not to correct scale, in Figure 2). The
relationship between the first and second rounds of investment arises from the first investment's special role. The first investment creates collateral (L2) that is used to back V's
claims in the venture's second round. These are the claims that arise from V's first and
second investments. Therefore the second investment is equal to the debt capacity that is
left over after the first investment has been backed by the second round collateral (I2 =
L2 - II /,). If the collateral does not grow fast enough (s < (,B+ 1)/fl) the second round of
investment will be less than the first round. This differs from the venture's subsequent
rounds where the growth in collateral that comes from each round of investment backs
only the following round's investment (plus the time value adjustment of the old claims).
As the collateral grows at rate s > 1 the investment path is increasing round to round. In
fact it can be shown, by using conditions (6), (7), and Proposition 3, that along an optimal
investment path the investments grow until the final round, IT. An optimal path has this
characteristic because without it there would be a shorter feasible investment path, which
violates optimality via the results of Proposition 3.
5. COMPARATIVE STATICS AND EXTENSIONS
In this section we investigate how changes in the model's underlying parameters and basic
assumptions affect the feasibility of the venture and the structure of the optimal investment path. We first analyse some comparative statics with respect to s and ,B.Second we
change the assumption that the investments into the venture are sunk (until they gain
value through the work of the entrepreneur). Third we let the assets in place earn some
return (or grow in value) after their initial period with the entrepreneur. Fourth we allow
the entrepreneur to have positive wealth.
The effect of changing s or ,Bon any given venture's feasibility and optimal investment
path is easily understood by noting the change's effect on condition (7).
Proposition 4. For any given venture consider the investmentpath constructed using
(6) for a given I, and T. As s or ,B increase the path continues to satisfy the 2 through T
feasibility conditions of (5), and S1/2 increases.

<-----Page 13----->NEHER

STAGED FINANCING

267

The proof of Proposition 4 is straightforward. When s increases the liquidation values
along the path (Li, 2<i- T) all rise, hence the 2 through T feasibility conditions of (5)
continue to hold. Furthermore the increase in s increases the return of the venture (R),
hence S1/2 also rises. When ,Brises the given investment path becomes "cheaper" in a
discounted value sense. The 2 through T feasibility conditions of (5) continue to hold as
in each period the investments to date (now discounted at a smaller rate) continue to be
covered by the post-repudiation payoff to V. The lower discounted value of the investment
path also means that S1/2 rises.
An increase in S1/2 implies that condition (7) is more easily satisfied, hence it is more
likely that the venture can be feasibly financed. If the venture is already financeable then
it is more likely that the venture can be feasibly financed in fewer periods (which is preferred). This result is not surprising in light of the roles of s and /B.Together they dictate
the net present profitability of the venture, and when this profitability rises (via either s
or /3 increasing) the venture becomes easier to finance. An important corollary to Proposition 4 is
Corollary 4.

As ,B 1 all profitable venturesbecomefinanceable.

The proof of Corollary 4 is established by considering conditions (6) and (7) as f--> 1.
For an investment path constructed using (6), a given II, and T, it is easily shown that as
P3-- 1 condition (7) becomes I_<sT- 1(s -_)I . For T sufficiently large this condition will
hold, hence the venture is financeable for any s > 1.
The cost of staged financing comes from the delay it imposes on the venture's return.
When /-->1 there is no discounting of the future, hence there is no cost of delay, hence
there is no cost to staged financing. Staged financing can therefore entirely overcome the
commitment problem, though potentially in an infinite number of rounds. When s-> 1 the
collateral that provides the basis for staging the investment builds very slowly and hence
the venture requires many stages to be completed.
Now consider the following simple change to the model. Let the assets purchased
with Ii have immediate outside value caIi,while maintaining the assumption that they have
outside value sIi after a period with the entrepreneur. A way of interpreting a (where
0`5 a< 1) is as a measure of the intangibility of the assets. When a is 0 (as in the original
model) the assets purchased are completely intangible until the addition of E's human
capital (which requires a period to implement). When a > 0 the assets are not completely
intangible and the venture's collateral in period i increases from s ,JIl Ij to
s ?I 11+ aI. The construction of the optimal investment path for this extended model
closely follows the construction of the optimal investment paths in the basic model. In
fact Proposition 3 holds when we substitute the following condition for condition (6)
i

(LIJ,=

(6a)

As above, we can understand the effect of changing a on any given venture's feasibility
and optimal investment path by noting the effect on condition (7). It is straightforward
to establish the following extension to Proposition 4 (the proof is omitted).
Proposition 4A. For any given ventureconsider the investmentpath constructedusing
(6a) for a given Il and T. As a increases the path continues to satisfy the 2 through T
feasibility conditions of (5), and S1/2 increases.

<-----Page 14----->268

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

Proposition 4A establishes that the new source of collateral diminishes the effect of
the commitment problem. In fact if the assets are perfectly tangible (ao= 1) repudiation
by E becomes meaningless as V's claims are entirely protected by the assets purchased.
Another simple change to the basic model is to let the venture's physical assets that
have had their period with E continue to grow in outside value at rate y. This implies that
the assets that are worth Li in round i are worth y Li in round i + 1, hence
Li+, = yLj+sI1.

(9)

Note that this also implies that the final value of the venture will be
SE,J-1 )/

VI

10

The parameter y can be thought of as representing how the venture grows in value in
ways that are not directly tied to the human capital of the entrepreneur. As above, the
construction of the optimal investment path for this extended model closely follows the
analysis of Section 4. Proposition 3 continues to hold when condition (6) is modified by
(9) and condition (7) is modified so that SI incorporates (10). It is again straightfoward
to establish the following extension to Proposition 4 (the proof is omitted).
Proposition 4B. For any given ventureconsider the investmentpath constructedusing
(6) (under(9)) for a given I, and T. As y increases the path continues to satisfy the 2 through
Tfeasibility conditions of (5), and S1/2 (under (10)) increases.
The new growth in value diminishes the effect of the commitment problem along the
lines of a decrease in the discount rate (an increase in I3).It makes the cost of staging
smaller because the assets are gaining value while the staged path delays the realization
of the venture's return. Therefore, an increase in ymakes the venture more likely to be
feasibly financed, and if already financeable then financeable in fewer periods. In fact
when the assets in place grow in value at the rate 1/,B there is no cost of staging, and as
in Corollary 4 all profitable ventures can be financed (though again in a potentially large
number of rounds).
Finally consider allowing E to have wealth greater than zero. The immediate impact
is that E's wealth ensures that all profitable ventures will go forward. E simply has to
provide the first round of investment himself, and then the collateral that is built up will
back outside investment for future rounds. However, full efficiency may not be achieved.
Ventures may still be financed in stages (E's wealth may not be enough to fully overcome
the effects of the commitment problem), and ventures may not go forward at full scale.
This second observation comes from noting that our above results on the invariance of
the venture's feasibility with respect to scale do not necessarily apply. An investment path
that includes a contribution from E cannot be scaled up without limit as E has a fixed
amount of wealth. The scale (the total amount of investment) of a venture financed at
partial scale is therefore dependent on the level of E's wealth.9
Allowing E to have some wealth can also change the character of the optimal investment path provided by an outside investor (the investments into the venture can now
include contributions from both E and V). It can be shown that it is optimal for E to
invest all his wealth at t = 1. This implies that the collateral in the second round of the
9. Note a similar finding in a different context in Hart and Moore (1994) and Moore (1992). The important
role of entrepreneurial wealth in predicting the scale of their activities is empirically documented in Evans and
Jovanovic (1989) and Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994a, 1994b).

venture comes from both E's investment, and V's initial investment. This collateral still
must support both of V's first and second rounds of investment, but the collateral increase
due to E's investment can lead to V's second round being larger than his first. The optimal
investment path from outside investors may now be monotonically increasing throughout,
rather than only after the first period (as was discussed above).
6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A useful place to consider the predictions of our model is in the venture capital market
where investment is often staged. What drives the staging of investment in our model is
the gradual embodiment of the entrepreneur's human capital in the physical capital of
the venture. This evolution increases the venture's collateral, hence allows more outside
financing. Each new stage of financing should therefore coincide with a significant development in the venture, such as a new patent, the final creation of a product, a clearer
view of the marketability of a product, etc. These are all ways in which the entrepreneur's
human capital becomes embodied in the physical assets of the venture. The coincidence
of the choice of stages of investment by venture capitalists and stages in the development
of ventures is well documented. As Sahlman (1990) says: "Each successive stage [of
financing] is generally tied to a significant development in the company" (see also Perez
(1986) and Lorenz (1989)). Lerner (1992) also reports this finding in his study on the disk
drive and biotechnology industries.
The end of the entrepreneurialprocess in our model consequently corresponds to the
time when all of the entrepreneur's relevant human capital is embodied in the venture's
physical capital. This seems to have empirical support in the findings of Perez (1986) and
Sahlman (1990). They note that entrepreneurs are often replaced towards the end of the
venture capital process when the venture has become less an entrepreneurial venture, and
more a standard firm. At this point the management of the venture requires the skills of
a standard manager, rather than those of an entrepreneur.10
Another important element of the hold-up problem that motivates the use of staged
financing in our model is the initial intangibility of the physical capital that is invested in
the venture. In fact Proposition 4A predicts that a reduction in the intangibility of a
venture's physical capital investments both increases the likelihood that the venture is able
to get financed, and decreases the optimal number of investment stages. Both Gompers
(1992, 1995) and Lerner (1992) find evidence that is consistent with these predictions.
Gompers finds that when assets are less tangible, more rounds of financing are required,
and Lerner finds that in firms with more tangible achievements there should be larger
infusions per round. Other empirical findings by Lerner, Gompers and Sahlman (1992)
on the nature of investment paths in venture capital are also consistent with our model's
predictions. All three authors find that the outside funds disbursed to a venture increase
with each round, and that outside finance comes after opportunities for inside finance
(entrepreneurialwealth and other sources) are exhausted.
It is interesting to consider what related conclusions a "real option" model of staged
financing might deliver. A real option model of investment into an entrepreneurialventure
is a model of investment under uncertainty, where the uncertainty creates an option value
to waiting to invest. Staged financing may arise as optimal due to the tradeoff between
the venture's current need for capital, and the value of the option to withhold capital until
10. This process is studied in a learning model by Chang, Siegel, and Thakor (1990) and in a model of
control rights by Hellman (1993).

the resolution of some uncertainty regarding the advancement of the venture. Empirically
then, each stage of financing should coincide with a development in the venture that
reflects a resolution of some uncertainty. If uncertainty is resolved at points of significant
development in the venture (as above) then the real option model delivers a similar prediction to our model regarding the coincidence of stages of investment and stages of development. The two models also may share similarities in their predictions of how the tangibility
of the capital investments affects the staged investment path. In both models the benefit
of staged financing comes from the interplay between sunk investment (investment in
intangible physical assets) and the progression of the venture. In our model staging arises
because up-front sunk investment is subject to hold-up. In a real option model staging
arises because waiting to make a sunk investment has an option value. In both cases a
reduction in the intangibility of the physical capital investments affects the need to stage
investment.
It is unclear whether a real option model would share our model's other empirically
supported predictions regarding the nature of staged investment in venture capital.
Further analysis of a real option model requires a precise specification of the process by
which uncertainty is resolved. However it is important to note that although they share
some relevant predictions, our model and a real option model address fundamentally
different issues. A real option model is simply a model of investment under uncertainty
and thus does not explicitly address the agency problem that surrounds the likely divergence in the objectives of the entrepreneur and the objectives of the venture capitalist.
Conversely the model in this paper is deterministic. We have abstracted away from uncertainty to focus on the role of the entrepreneur, and his unique human capital, in the
financing of an entrepreneurial venture. Both agency and uncertainty are significant
aspects of entrepreneurial finance, and incorporating them into a common framework is
an important avenue for future research. One question that arises when both uncertainty
and agency are present in a model of staged financing is: how is control over refinancing
decisions contractually allocated across different realizations of the uncertainty? This is
investigated in Neher (1996), where convertible preferred stock (a commonly used financial instrument in venture capital) is shown to allocate this control efficiently.
Though we have focused on the relationship between our model and venture capital
investment, the conclusions reached here may shed light on general issues involving the
ability of investment structure to overcome hold-up, or commitment, problems. These
may arise in other realms of entrepreneurial finance including the financing of entrepreneurial type projects within firms.

APPENDIX
Here we provide a thorough analysis of the alternating offers bargaining game that follows a repudiation of the
existing contract by E in period i of the venture. We first present Lemma I which concerns the general problem
of bargaining over a fixed amount of surplus (Si) when one of the players has an outside option (V can liquidate
for Li) and faces a constraint on the amount of the surplus that can be credibly offered to her. Label the
constraint C.

following 2 cases characterize the equilibrium:

correspondingto V ahvays choosing
Ccase2. If Li > C then the game has a uniquesutbgamepeifect equilibriumn
liquidation. The result is i:mmediateliquidationby V.
Proof of Lemma 1. As we are using a standard bargaining framework, and the bargaining is over a
known quantity, the proof of the unique subgame perfect equilibrium follows closely the presentation of Osborne
and Rubinstein (1990). The point of departure is the constraint imposed by C. We proceed by showing the
subgame perfection of the outlined strategies. The proof of uniqueness follows that presented by Osborne and
Rubinstein (1990) and is omitted.
(1.a) Given the strategies outlined and as Lij-SS/l + 3 V cannot ever improve her position by liquidating
the venture's assets. Also as C>Si/l + 3 there is no relevant constraint on the divisions of surplus offered. The
standard result therefore applies and the outlined strategies form a subgame perfect equilibrium of the bargaining
game.
(1.b) Given the strategies outlined and as Li <3CV cannot ever improve her position by liquidating the
venture's assets. To determine that the strategies offered form a subgame perfect equilibrium consider a subgame
starting in period t* of the bargaining game that begins with a move by E. Is E's proposed strategy an optimal
response to that played by V? Any strategy played by E will either yield division (xl, x2) in period t, where
xI -Si - 3C and t- t*, or division (Si - C, C) in period t, where t-' t* + 1. Clearly offering (Si - 3C, 3C) immediately is optimal as Si - 3C?'t- t1XI where t- t*, x1 ?Si - 3C, and Si - 3C> 3't' (Si - C) where t- t* + 1.
Now, given the strategy proposed by E, is V playing an optimal response? If V accepts (Si - 3C, 3C) in t*
that yields V 3 C. Anything else would generate 3C in period t, t > t*, or Y2in period t, where Y2- C and t - t* + 1.
+
Note that E would accept the division (3(Si - 3C), Si - 3(S, - 3C)) where Si - 3(Si - 3C) > C as C< Si/I ?,
but by assumption the constraint C is the maximum share that V can credibly collect. Clearly then the best of
these options is to accept (Si -6C, 3C), or reject and propose (Si - C, C). V's strategy is therefore a best
response. The other possible subgames are similar.
(1.c) As C?-Si - 3(Si - Li) there is no relevant constraint on the divisions of surplus offered. The standard
result of bargaining with an outside option therefore applies and the outlined strategies form a subgame perfect
equilibrium of the bargaining game. Consider for example V's liquidation decision. Consider, as above, a
subgame starting in period t* with E proposing a division of surplus (xi, xJ). Note that if x2 < Li, then V should
liquidate immediately. Not liquidating would yield at most Si - 3(Si - Li) in period t* + 1, or Li in period t* + 2
(as Es proposal is stationary we need not consider times past t* + 2; they are clearly worse for V). Liquidating
immediately is best as Li > 3(Si - 3(Si - Li)) > 322Li(note the assumption on the size of Li). E must therefore offer
an (xi,,x2) such that x >Li, the best choice being (Si- Li, Li). Showing the subgame perfection of the outlined
strategies follows the arguments of case (1.b) above.
(1.d) This is like case 1.c, but V's proposed division of surplus violates the feasibility constraint
C(C < Si - 3(Si - Li)). The proposed strategies clearly form a subgame perfect equilibrium as the strategies of
both E and V reflect their best possible payoffs given the constraints due to C and Li. Consider the discussion
of the C constraint in case (i.b) above, and the discussion of the Li constraint in case (I.c) above.
2. As Li > C there is no feasibly division of surplus that yields VLi. V's optimal response to any proposed
division of surplus is therefore immediate liquidation. II
It is straightforward to establish that as 3-k 1, V's payoff from the equilibrium outlined in Lemma 1
becomes max {Li, min (C, Si/2)}.

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

Proof of Proposition 1. We first use an induction argument to establish that V cannot be credibly offered
a claim on Si greater than BT+ -Qi -Gi. Conversely a claim smaller or equal to pT+ l-Qi - Gi is credible. We
then use Lemma 1 to establish equationi (2). It follows by construction that if the venture is continued then Pi
is repudiation-proof.
Assume that Proposition 1 holds for all periods j, i <j - T. Consider the bargaining in period i over the
surplus Si. Label as wi a proposed claim for V on Si. A claim on Si is implemented via a claim on R, call it pi
(this claim is in $T+ 1 and must incorporate the investments yet to be made). When Coi> PT? liQi - Gi this
implies that pi> Qi. There are 2 cases to consider. If Qi = R then clearly Pi, and hence oi, is not credible. If
Qi < R then for some jPj < pi. As the outcome of repudiation and renegotiation in period j is continuation of the
venture with a smaller claim on R for V, E will clearly repudiate to bid down V's claim from pi. The claim pi,
and hence wi, is not credible. When wi_ T+'
-G, this implies that pi < Qi. Now if E repudiates in any
period j, i <j- T the venture is either immediately liquidated, or continued under a repudiation-proof contract,
Pj, where Pj>pi. In either case repudiating is not in the interests of E. The claim pi, and hence ci, is credible.
This establishes pT+ I -iQi - Gi in the role of C in Lemma 1. Lemma 1 therefore establishes (2) as characterizing
the subgame perfect equilibrium of the bargaining game in period i. By construction if the venture is continued
then UiV-<I3T+ -Qi- Gi, and hence Pi- Qi, and by the above argument Pi is repudiation-proof.
To complete the proof we simply need to establish the equilibrium in period T. Here QT= R, so trivially
QT represents C in Lemma 1 and immediate liquidation is never chosen (QT>
LT). Lemma 1 establishes the
subgame perfect equilibrium, which as 3-* 1 can be chracterized by UTV=max {Li, min (R, Si/2)} = max {Li, Si/
2). This can be implemented via the repudiation-proof contract PT= UT//p. |
Proof of Proposition 2. To prove parts (a) and (b) we will consider a feasible investment path that does
not satisfy one (or both) condition(s) and show how the path could be changed profitably while maintaining
feasibility. First consider a feasible investment path (II,
IT), where Uiv"?Li*for some i (2 -<i-<T). Now

establish the T- 1 feasibility constraints of the new investment path, (II, I2, .JT1). All the conditions for
the constraints i through T - 1 are satisfied, as these correspond with the conditions for the constraints i + 1
through Tofthe old path. For example Uiv= Lu,i2and l

the i - 1-th constraint we also know that U/il = Ui7 because by assumption Uri# Li, and by construction
Li* >Li_., hence both u/i1,and Ur are based on the surplus available, or the constraint imposed by future
repudiation, and these are the same for both paths. Again iI p,i+ ljI <y1 flP-iJ*
and the i - 1-th constraint
is satisfied. What remains is the 1 through i - 2 constraints. We will show that the i - 2-th constraint holds, the

original path is trivially not optimal as this i - 1-th round of investment could be removed, thus finishing the
project one period earlier). For E small enough the i-th feasibility constraint still holds and this new path
(II, I2,...,IT) is preferred by E as the discounted value of the investments is lower. The other feasibility constraints also continue to hold. For the constraints k, where i+ 1 <k?T, Ukv= Lk= Lk*= Ukv and

path is therefore feasible as all T feasibility constraints hold.
Proof of Proposition 3. We prove Proposition 3 by showing that a given venture that is feasibly financed
using a T period investment path (that satisfies (6) and (8)) yields E a higher payoff than if the venture were
financed using a greater than T period path (also satisfying (6) and (8)). Define an investment path
