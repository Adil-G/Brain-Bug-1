RATIONAL CHOICE AND THE STRUCTURE
OF THE ENVIRONMENT*
HERBERT A. SIMON
Carnegie Institute of Technology

A growing interest in decision making
in psychology is evidenced by the recent
publication of Edwards' review article
in the Psychological Bulletin (1) and
the Santa Monica Conference volume,
Decision Processes (7). In this work,
much attention has been focused on the
characterization of rational choice, and
because the latter topic has been a central concern in economics, the theory of
decision making has become a natural
meeting ground for psychological and
economic theory.
A comparative examination of the
models of adaptive behavior employed
in psychology (e.g., learning theories),
and of the models of rational behavior
employed in economics, shows that in
almost all respects the latter postulate
a much greater complexity in the choice
mechanisms, and a much larger capacity
in the organism for obtaining information and performing computations, than
do the former. Moreover, in the limited range of situations where the predictions of the two theories have been
compared (see [7, Ch. 9, 10, 18]), the
learning theories appear to account for
the observed behavior rather better than
do the theories of rational behavior.
Both from these scanty data and from
an examination of the postulates of the
economic models it appears probable
that, however adaptive the behavior of
organisms in learning and choice situations, this adaptiveness falls far short
of the ideal of "maximizing" postulated

in economic theory. Evidently, organisms adapt well enough to "satisflce";
they do not, in general, "optimize."
If this is the case, a great deal can
be learned about rational decision making by taking into account, at the outset, the limitations upon the capacities
and complexity of the organism, and by
taking account of the fact that the environments to which it must adapt possess properties that permit further simplication of its choice mechanisms. It
may be useful, therefore, to ask: How
simple a set of choice mechanisms can
we postulate and still obtain the gross
features of observed adaptive choice behavior?
In a previous paper (6) I have put
forth some suggestions as to the kinds
of "approximate" rationality that might
be employed by an organism possessing
limited information and limited computational facilities. The suggestions were
"hypothetical" in that, lacking definitive
knowledge of the human decisional processes, we can only conjecture on the basis of our everyday experiences, our introspection, and a very limited body of
psychological literature what these processes are. The suggestions were intended, however, as empirical statements, however tentative, about some
of the actual mechanisms involved in
human and other organismic choice.2
Now if an organism is confronted

Since writing the paper referred to I have
found confirmation for a number of its hypotheses in the interesting and significant
study, by A. de Groot, of the thought processes of chess players (3). I intend to discuss
the implications of these empirical findings for
my model in another place.

with the problem of behaving approximately rationally, or adaptively, in a
particular environment, the kinds of
simplifications that are suitable may depend not only on the characteristics—
sensory, neural, and other—of the organism, but equally upon the structure
of the environment. Hence, we might
hope to discover, by a careful examination of some of the fundamental structural characteristics of the environment,
some further clues as to the nature of
the approximating mechanisms used in
decision making. This is the line of attack that will be adopted in the present
paper.
The environment we shall discuss initially is perhaps a more appropriate one
for a rat than for a human. For the
term environment is ambiguous. We
are not interested in describing some
physically objective world in its totality, but only those aspects of the totality that have relevance as the "life
space" of the organism considered.
Hence, what we call the "environment"
will depend upon the "needs," "drives,"
or "goals" of the organism, and upon
its perceptual apparatus.
THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ORGANISM
We consider first a simplified (perhaps "simple-minded") organism that
has a single need—food—and is capable of three kinds of activity: resting,
exploration, and food getting. The precise nature of these activities will be
explained later. The organism's life
space may be described as a surface
over which it can locomote. Most of
the surface is perfectly bare, but at isolated, widely scattered points there are
little heaps of food, each adequate for
a meal.
The organism's vision permits it to
see, at any moment, a circular portion
of the surface about the point in which
it is standing. It is able to move at
some fixed maximum rate over the surface. It metabolizes at a given aver-

age rate and is able to store a certain
amount of food energy, so that it needs
to eat a meal at certain average intervals. It has the capacity, once it sees
a food heap, to proceed toward it at the
maximum rate of locomotion. The problem of rational choice is to choose its
path in such a way that it will not
starve.
Now I submit that a rational way for
the organism to behave is the following:
(a) it explores the surface at random,
watching for a food heap; (b) when it
sees one, it proceeds to it and eats (food
getting); (c) if the total consumption
of energy during the average time required, per meal, for exploration and
food getting is less than the energy of
the food consumed in the meal, it can
spend the remainder of its time in
resting.8
There is nothing particularly remarkable about this description of rational
choice, except that it differs so sharply
from the more sophisticated models of
human rationality that have been proposed by economists and others. Let
us see what it is about the organism
and its environment that makes its
choice so simple.
1. It has only a single goal: food.
It does not need to weigh the respective
advantages of different goals. It requires no "utility function" or set of
"indifference curves" to permit it to
choose between alternatives.
2. It has no problem .of maximization. It needs only to maintain a certain average rate of food intake, and
additional food is of no use to it. In

A reader who is familiar with W. Grey
Walter's mechanical turtle, Machina speculatrix (8), will see as we proceed that the description of our organism could well be used
as a set of design specifications to assure the
survival of his turtle in an environment
sparsely provided with battery chargers. Since
I was not familiar with the structure of the
turtle when I developed this model, there are
some differences in their behavior—but the
resemblance is striking.

<-----Page 2----->RATIONAL CHOICE AND ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE
the psychologist's language, it has a
definite, fixed aspiration level, and its
successes or failures do not change its
aspirations.
3. The nature of its perceptions and
its environment limit sharply its planning horizon. Since the food heaps are
distributed randomly, there is no need
for pattern in its searching activities.
Once it sees a food heap, it can follow
a definite "best" path until it reaches it.
4. The nature of its needs and environment create a very natural separation between "means" and "ends." Except for the food heaps, one point on
the surface is as agreeable to it as another. Locomotion has significance only
as it is a means to reaching food.4
We shall see that the first point is not
essential. As long as aspirations are
fixed, the planning horizon is limited,
and there is a sharp distinction between
means and ends, the existence of multiple goals does not create any real difficulties in choice. The real complications ensue only when we relax the
last three conditions; but to see clearly
what is involved, we must formulate
the model a little more precisely.
PERCEPTUAL POWERS, STORAGE
CAPACITY, AND SURVIVAL
It is convenient to describe the organism's life space not as a continuous
surface, but as a branching system of
paths, like a maze, each branch point
representing a choice point. We call
the selection of a branch and locomotion
to the next branch point a "move." At
a small fraction of the branch points are
heaps of food.
Let p, 0<p<l, be the percentage of
branch points, randomly distributed, at

It is characteristic of economic models
of rationality that the distinction between
"means" and "ends" plays no essential role in
them. This distinction cannot be identified
with the distinction between behavior alternatives and utilities, for reasons that are set
forth at some length in the author's Administrative Behavior, Ch. 4 and S (5).

which food is found. Let d be the average number of paths diverging from each
branch point. Let » be the number of
moves ahead the organism can see.
That is, if there is food at any of the
branch points within v moves of the
organism's present position, it can select
the proper paths and reach it. Finally
let B be the maximum number of moves
the organism can make between meals
without starving.
At any given moment, the organism
can see d branch points at a distance of
one move from his present position, d2

points. When it chooses a branch and
makes a move, d" new points become
visible on its horizon. Hence, in the
course of m moves, md" new points
appear. Since it can make a maximum
of H moves, and since » of these will be
required to reach food that it has discovered on its horizon, the probability,
Q = 1 — P, that it will not survive will
be equal to the probability that no food
points will be visible in (H — v) moves.
(If p is small, we can disregard the
possibility that food will be visible inside
its planning horizon on the first move.)
Let p be lie probability that none of
the d" new points visible at the end of a
particular move is a food point.

Then:

We see that the survival chances, from
meal to meal, of this simple organism
depend on four parameters, two that
describe the organism and two the environment : p, the richness of the environment in food; d, the richness of the environment in paths; H, the storage
capacity of the organism; and v, the
range of vision of the organism.

CHOICE MECHANISMS FOR
MULTIPLE GOALS
We consider now a more complex
organism capable of searching for and
responding to two or more kinds of goal
objects. In doing this we could introduce any desired degree of complexity
into the choice process; but the interesting problem is how to introduce multiple
goals with a minimum complication of
the process—that is, to construct an
organism capable of handling its decision
problems with relatively primitive choice
mechanisms.
At the very least, the presence of two
goals will introduce a consistency requirement—the time consumed in attaining
one goal will limit the time available for
pursuit of the other. But in an environment like the one we have been considering, there need be no further relationship
between the two goals. In our original
formulation, the only essential stipulation was that H, the storage capacity, be
adequate to maintain the risk of starvation below a stipulated level (1 — P).
Now we introduce the additional stipulation that the organism should only devote a fraction, X, of its time to foodseeking activities, leaving the remaining
fraction, 1 — X, to other activities. This
new stipulation leads to a requirement
of additional storage capacity.
In order to control the risk of starving,
the organism must begin its exploration
for food whenever it has reached a level
of H periods of food storage. If it has
a total storage of (M + H) periods of
food, and if the food heaps are at least
a(M + -ff) in size, then it need begin the
search for food only M periods after its
last feeding. But the food research will
require, on the average, M periods.
Thus, in terrestrial animals there is little oxygen
storage and life can be maintained in the absence
of air for only a few minutes. I am not arguing
as to which way the causal arrow runs, but only
that the organisms, in this respect, are adapted
to their environments and do not provide storage
that is superfluous.

133

Hence, if a hunger threshold is established that leads the organism to begin
to explore /* periods after feeding, we
will have :

Hence, by making n sufficiently large,
we can make X as small as we please.
Parenthetically, it may be noted that
we have here a close analogue to the very
common two-bin system of controlling
industrial inventories. The primary
storage, H, is a buffer stock to meet
demands pending the receipt of new
orders (with risk, I — P, of running
out); the secondary storage, n, defines
the "order point" ; and p + M is the
average order quantity. The storage ju
is fixed to balance storage "costs" against
the cost (in this case, time pressure) of
too frequent reordering.
If food and the second goal object
(water, let us say) are randomly and
independently distributed, then there are
no important complications resulting
from interference between the two activities. Designate by the subscript 1 the
variables and parameters referring to
food getting (e.g., MI is the food threshold
in periods), and by the subscript 2 the
quantities referring to water seeking.
The organism will have adequate time
for both activities if Xi + X2 < 1.
Now when the organism reaches either
its hunger or thirst threshold, it will
begin exploration. We assume that if
either of the goal objects becomes visible,
it will proceed to that object and satisfy
its hunger or thirst (this will not increase
the number of moves required, on the
average, to reach the other object) ; but
if both objects become visible at the
same time, and if Si and S% are the
respective quantities remaining in storage at this time, then it will proceed to
food or water as Mi/Si is greater or less
than Mz/S}. This choice will maximize
its survival probability. What is required, then, is a mechanism that produces a drivejproportional to Mi/Si.

<-----Page 5----->134

HERBERT A. SIMON

A priority mechanism of the kind just
described is by no means the only or
simplest one that can be postulated.
An even simpler rule is for the organism
to persist in searching for points that
will satisfy the particular need that first
reached its threshold and initiated exploratory behavior. This is not usually
an efficient procedure, from the standpoint of conserving goal-reaching time,
but it may be entirely adequate for an
organism generously endowed with storage capacity.
We see that an organism can satisfy
a number of distinct needs without requiring a very elaborate mechanism for
choosing among them. In particular,
we do not have to postulate a utility
function or a "marginal rate of substitution."
We can go even further, and assert
that a primitive choice mechanism is
adequate to take advantage of important
economies, if they exist, which are derivable from the interdependence of the
activities involved in satisfying the different needs. For suppose the organism
has n needs, and that points at which he
can satisfy each are distributed randomly
and independently through the environment, each with the same probability, p.
Then the probability that no points
satisfying any of the needs will be visible
on a particular move is />", and the mean
number of moves for discovery of the
first need-satisfying point is:

Suppose that the organism begins to
explore, moves to the first need-satisfying
point it discovers, resumes its exploration, moves to the next point it discovers
that satisfies a need other than the one
already satisfied, and so on. Then the
mean time required to search for all n
goals will be:

M „ = mn +

In particular, if p is close to one, that
is, if need-satisfying points are rare, we
will have:

and
[3.5]

Now substituting particular values for
n in [3.5] we get: Mt — 3/2 M\;
Ms = 11/6 My, Mt = 25/12 Mi, etc.
We see that if the organism has two
separate needs, its exploration time will
be only 50 per cent greater than—and
not twice as great as—if it has only one
need ; for four needs the exploration time
will be only slightly more than twice as
great as for a single need, and so on.
A little consideration of the program just
described will show that the joint exploratory process does not reduce the
primary storage capacity required by the
organism but does reduce the secondary
storage capacity required. As a matter
of fact, there would be no necessity at
all for secondary storage.
This conclusion holds only if the needsatisfying points are independently distributed. If there is a negative correlation in the joint distribution of points
satisfying different needs, then it may
be economical for the organism to pursue
its needs separately, and hence to have
a simple signaling mechanism, involving
secondary storage, to trigger its several
exploration drives. This point will be
developed further in the next section.
A word may be said here about
"avoidance needs." Suppose that certain points in the organism's behavior
space are designated as "dangerous."
Then it will need to avoid those paths
that lead to these particular points. If
r per cent of all points, randomly distributed, are dangerous, then the number
of available paths, among those visible

<-----Page 6----->RATIONAL CHOICE AND ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE
at a given move, will be reduced to
(1 - r)d\ Hence, p' = (1 - pY1-^
will be smaller than p (Equation 2.1),
and M (Equation 2.6) will be correspondingly larger. Hence, the presence of
danger points simply increases the average exploration time and, consequently,
the required storage capacity of the
organism.
FURTHER SPECIFICATION OF THE
ENVIRONMENT: CLUES
In our discussion up to the present
point, the range of the organism's anticipations of the future has been limited by the number of behavior alternatives available to it at each move (d),
and the length of the "vision" ( v ) . It
is a simple matter to introduce into the
model the consequences of several types
of learning. An increase in the repertoire of behavior alternatives or in the
length of vision can simply be represented by changes in d and v, respectively.
A more interesting possibility arises if
the food points are not distributed completely at random, and if there are clues
that indicate whether a particular intermediate point is rich or poor in paths
leading to food points. First, let us
suppose that on the path leading up to
each food point the k preceding choice
points are marked with a food clue.
Once the association between the clue
and the subsequent appearance of the
food point is learned by the organism,
its exploration can terminate with the
discovery of the clue, and it can follow
a determinate path from that point on.
This amounts to substituting v' = (v
+ k) for v.
A different kind of clue might operate
in the following fashion. Each choice
point has a distinguishable characteristic
that is associated with the probability
of encountering a food point if a path is
selected at random leading out of this
choice point. The organism can then
select at each move the choice point

135

with the highest probability. If only
certain choice points are provided with
such clues, then a combination of random and systematic exploration can be
employed. Thus the organism may be
led into "regions" where the probability
of goal attainment is high relative to
other regions, but it may have to explore randomly for food within a given
region.
A concrete example of such behavior
in humans is the "position play" characteristic of the first phase of a chess
game. The player chooses moves on
the basis of certain characteristics of resulting positions (e.g., the extent to
which his pieces are developed). Certain positions are adjudged richer in attacking and defensive possibilities than
others, but the original choice may involve no definite plan for the subsequent
action after the "good" position has
been reached.
Next, we turn to the problem of
choice that arises when those regions of
the behavior space that are rich in
points satisfying one need (pi is high
in these regions) are poor in points
satisfying another need (p% is low in
these same regions). In the earlier case
of goal conflict (two or more points
simultaneously visible mediating different needs), we postulated a priority
mechanism that amounted to a mechanism for computing relative need intensity and for responding to the more
intense need. In the environment with
clues, the learning process would need
to include a conditioning mechanism
that would attach the priority mechanism to the response to competing clues,
as well as to the response to competing
visible needs.
Finally, we have thus far specified
the environment in such a way that
there is only one path leading to each
point. Formally, this condition can always be satisfied by representing as two
or more points any point that can be
reached by multiple paths. For $ome

<-----Page 7----->136

HERBERT A. SIMON

purposes, it might be preferable to
specify an environment in which paths
converge as well as diverge. This can
be done without disturbing the really
essential conditions of the foregoing
analysis. For behavior of the sort we
have been describing, we require of the
environment only:
1. that if a path is selected completely at random the probability of
survival is negligible;
2. that there exist clues in the environment (either the actual visibility of
need-satisfying points or anticipatory
clues) which permit the organism, sufficiently frequently for survival, to select
specific paths that lead with certainty,
or with very high probability, to a needsatisfying point.

satisfaction of any particular need is
not critical.
We have introduced other assumptions that represent characteristics of
the environment, the most important
being that need satisfaction can take
place only at "rare" points which (with
some qualifications we have indicated)
are distributed randomly.
The most important conclusion we
have reached is that blocks of the organism's time can be allocated to activities related to individual needs (separate means-end chains) without creating any problem of over-all allocation
or coordination or the need for any general "utility function." The only scarce
resource in the situation is time, and its
scarcity, measured by the proportion of
the total time that the organism will
need to be engaged in some activity,

tral argument. We can introduce a
mechanism that leads the organism to
choose time-conserving paths, where
multiple paths are available for satisfying a given need, without any assumption of a mechanism that allocates time
among different needs. The former
mechanism simply increases the "slack"
in the whole system, and makes it even
more feasible to ignore the complementarities among activities in programming the over-all behavior of the organism.
This is not the place to discuss at
length the application of the model to
human behavior, but a few general
statements may be in order. First, the
analysis has been a static one, in the
sense that we have taken the organism's needs and its sensing and planning capacities as given. Except for a
few comments, we have not considered
how the organism develops needs or
learns to meet them. One would conjecture, from general observation and
from experimentation with aspiration
levels, that in humans the balance between the time required to meet needs
and the total time available is maintained by the raising and lowering of
aspiration levels. I have commented
on this point at greater length in my
previous paper.8
Second, there is nothing about the
model that implies that the needs are
physiological and innate rather than
sociological and acquired. Provided that
the needs of the organism can be specified at any given time in terms of the
aspiration levels for the various kinds
of consummatory behavior, the model
can be applied.
The principal positive implication of
the model is that we should be skeptical
in postulating for humans, or other

rat's aspiration levels to considerations of realizability, see Festinger (2).

organisms, elaborate mechanisms for
choosing among diverse needs. Common denominators among needs may
simply not exist, or may exist only in
very rudimentary form; and the nature of the organism's needs in relation
to the environment may make their
nonexistence entirely tolerable.
There is some positive evidence bearing on this point in the work that has
been done on conflict and frustration.
A common method of producing conflict in the laboratory is to place the
organism in a situation where: (a) it is
stimulated to address itself simultaneously to alternative goal-oriented behaviors, or (b) it is stimulated to a
goal-oriented behavior, but restricted
from carrying out the behaviors it usually evinces in similar natural situations. This suggests that conflict may
arise (at least in a large class of situations) from presenting the animal with
situations with which it is not "programmed" to deal. Conflict of choice
may often be equivalent to an absence
of a choice mechanism in the given
situation. And while it may be easy to
create such situations in the laboratory, the absence of a mechanism to
deal with them may simply reflect the
fact that the organism seldom encounters equivalent situations in its natural
environment.7
CONCLUSION
In this paper I have attempted to
identify some of the structural characteristics that are typical of the "psychological" environments of organisms.
We have seen that an organism in an
environment with these characteristics
requires only very simple perceptual and
choice mechanisms to satisfy its several
needs and to assure a high probability
of its survival over extended periods of
