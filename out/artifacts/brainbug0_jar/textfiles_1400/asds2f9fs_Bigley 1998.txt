STRAINING FOR SHARED MEANING IN

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE: PROBLEMS OF 

TRUST AND DISTRUST

We present a problem-centered organizing framework of trust. in which prominent
conceptualizations of trust and distrust from the organizational and allied social
sciences are categorized based on the questions they attempt to answer. The framework we outline here is intended to complement earlier typologies by suggesting
alternative strategies for employing the diverse trust literature. identifying questions
that could be profitably addressed through interdisciplinary research efforts. and
distinguishing disagreements where debate and research would seem to be especially worthwhile from those where such activities would appear to be much less
useful.

A scientific concept h a s meaning only because
scientists mean something by it. The meaning is
scientifically valid only if what they intend by it
becomes actual: Droblems are solved and intentions a r e fulfilled as inquiry continues (Kaplan,
1964: 46).

What is trust? This question h a s been receiving increasing attention by scholars in organizational science a n d related fields. However, as
the volume of research emphasizing constructs
labeled "trust" a n d "distrust" h a s expanded
over the last several decades, the number of
uses a n d meanings ascribed to these terms h a s
grown also. The present conceptual diversity in
the literature on trust is reflected in the works of
several scholars, who have suggested typological systems intended to organize the vast interdisciplinary research on the subject (e.g., Bromiley & Cummings, 1995; Hosmer. 1995; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1995a.b; Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth,
1993).
For example, Sitkin a n d Roth (1993) suggest
that the work on trust could be collected into
four basic categories: (1) trust as a n individual
attribute, (2) trust as a behavior, (3) trust as a
We presented a n earlier version of this article a t the
a n n u a l Academy of Management meeting in Boston, 1997.

comments on earlier versions of this article.

situational feature, a n d (4) trust as a n institutional arrangement. Hosmer (1995) posits that
individual expectations, interpersonal relations,
economic exchanges, social structures, a n d ethical principles represent the major approaches
to, or contexts of, trust. Following closely on the
work of Worchel (1979). Lewicki a n d Bunker
(1995a.b) contend that research on trust could be
grouped into three primary categories, each a s sociated with a particular disciplinary perspective: (1) personality theorists' view of trust as a n
individual difference, (2) sociologists' a n d economists' notion of trust as a n institutional phenomenon, a n d (3) social psychologists' conceptualization of trust as a n expectation of another
party in a transaction.
The remarkable diversity in conceptualizations of trust seems to be disconcerting for many
scholars (e.g., Barber, 1983; Butler, 1991; Hosmer.
1995, Lewicki & Bunker, 1995a.b; Shapiro, 1987;
Zucker, 1986).For instance, Shapiro laments that
the attention scholars have given h a s resulted
in "a confusing potpourri of definitions applied
to a host of units a n d levels of analysis" (1987:
624). Hosmer agrees, stating that "there appears
to be widespread agreement on the importance
of trust in human conduct, but unfortunately
there also appears to be equally widespread
lack of agreement on a suitable definition of the
construct" (1995: 380). Lewicki a n d Bunker a d d
that, despite the level of interest a n d range of

viewpoints in the area of trust, "there h a s been
remarkably little effort to integrate these different perspectives or articulate the key role that
trust plays in critical social processes" (1995b:
135).
The uneasiness associated with the lack of
consensus on the meaning of trust (and distrust)
is understandable, because disagreement of
this sort h a s been regarded as a serious impediment to collective efforts a t scientific advancement (Pfeffer, 1993). Here, though, we challenge
the notion that the use of multiple conceptualizations of trust in organizational science h a s
been a major obstacle to our understanding of
organizational phenomena. In fact, we assert
that considerable knowledge h a s accumulated
on issues of trust. However, it h a s accrued to
specific problems a n d related theoretical frameworks, rather than to the topic area of trust as a
whole (cf., Lewicki & Bunker, 1995b). Consequently, we contend that a more reasoned discourse on trust-related issues in organizational
science would likely consist of research programs acknowledging or attempting to take a d vantage of the extant conceptual variety, rather
than trying to eliminate it altogether.
Accordingly, we propose a problem-centered
approach designed to assist organizational scientists to manage more effectively the diversity
on the trust topic. The particular framework we
present groups prominent conceptualizations of
trust a n d distrust from the organizational a n d
allied social sciences into categories based on
the general types of questions they attempt to
answer. This method contrasts with earlier classification schemes, in that it is not based primarily on the theoretical differences or disciplinary roots of the works examined. Although
the previous systems have been quite useful in
helping scholars to organize the oceanic volume
of literature focusing on constructs of trust, they
have also accentuated the topic area's conceptual diversity without providing a n effective
means of dealing with it.
The framework we outline here is intended to
complement earlier typologies by suggesting to
researchers alternative ways of employing the
diverse a n d voluminous trust literature. We
have grounded the framework on the idea that
differences among theories or definitions of
trust require attention only to the extent that the
differing conceptualizations themselves attempt
to address the same organizational problems.

The utility of a problem-centered focus derives
from several sources. First, it provides a way for
researchers to coherently delimit the work on
trust a n d distrust to that which is pertinent to
their own specific research issues. Second, it
affords scholars a means of distinguishing disagreements where debate a n d research would
seem to be especially worthwhile from those
where such activities would appear to be less
useful. Third, it suggests how two substantively
different-and
seemingly incommensurateconceptualizations of trust may be employed together, without necessarily compromising the
theoretical integrity of either. In general, the
framework we introduce in this paper is part of
a shift in the question, "What is trust?" to what
may be a better question: "Which trust a n d
when?"
We begin the article with a discussion in
which we attempt to suggest the magnitude of
the incongruities that exist among trust constructs. We contend that while the extant diversity probably cannot be accommodated under a
single conceptualization of trust, there does appear to be some coherence within the topic area,
which we discuss in terms of a trust theme. Next,
we introduce the problem-centered categorization system, considering several illustrative approaches to trust within each problem class, a n d
we specify the advantages of employing this
type of approach. We conclude the article with a
discussion of how a n appreciation for the diversity in the organizational problems related to
trust perspectives can benefit future research.

VULNERABILITY: A COMMON THEME O F
TRUST RESEARCH
Organizational scientists employing t h e
terms "trust" a n d "distrust" have drawn from a
broad range of social science disciplines in order to gain perspectives, develop models, a n d
identify methods for explaining a n d predicting
a n array of organizational phenomena at varying levels a n d units of analysis. In fact, the
extant variety in approaches to trust is largely a
function of the diverse theoretical perspectives
a n d research interests of those scholars who
have used the term (cf., Lewicki & Bunker, 199533).
A comparison of several prominent models is
illustrative of the extent of conceptual diversity
on this topic.

<-----Page 3----->nd Pearce

Rotter, for instance, defines trust as "a generalized expectancy held by a n individual that the
word, promise, oral or written statement of a n other individual or group can be relied upon"
(1980: 1). He views it as a disposition that would
be most predictive in situations where individuals a r e relatively unfamiliar with one another.
In contrast, Gambetta (1988)conceives of trust as
a calculated decision to cooperate with specific
others, based on information about others' personal qualities a n d social constraints. Dunn
(1988) explicitly advances two distinct trust concepts: one based on calculated decisions a n d
another grounded in human emotions. Alternatively, Zucker proposes that trust is "a set of
expectations shared by all those involved in a n
exchange" (1986: 54), a n d she maintains that
these expectations a r e preconscious in nature in
that they a r e taken for granted as part of the
world known in common, until they a r e violated.
Finally, Shapiro (1987) defines trust as a n agentprincipal relationship.
In addition to the diversity associated with
authors' basic definitions of trust, the various
subcategories many scholars have posited have
introduced further complexity. For example,
McAllister argues for two kinds or bases of trust
(1995: 25): one grounded in cognitive judgments
of another's competence or reliability (reierred
to as "cognition-based trust"), a n d another
founded in affective bonds among individuals
(referred to as "affect-based trust"). Lewicki a n d
Bunker (1995a.b) distinguish three types of trust:
calculus-, knowledge-, a n d identification-based
trust. Sitkin (1995)also identifies three aspects of
trust; his a r e competency-, benevolence-, a n d
value-based trust.
Furthermore, although constructs of trust have
been the most common foci for organizational
scholars within the topic area, they have increasingly emphasized distrust (e.g., Bies &
Tripp, 1996; Fein & Hilton, 1994; Kramer, 1994;
Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin & Stickel, 1996). Moreover, in some recent works centering on distrust,
researchers treat it as a distinct concept from
that of trust. For example, Sitkin a n d Roth posit
that trust i s a "belief in a person's competence to
perform a specific task under specific circumstances," whereas distrust is a "belief that a
person's values or motives will lead them to
approach a l l situations in a n unacceptable
manner" (1993: 373). Defining trust a n d distrust
as independent constructs i s at odds with the

407

perspectives of many other scholars, who view
trust a n d distrust as polar opposites (e.g., Rotter,
1967).
These examples help to demonstrate that
meaningful a n d substantive differences exist
among various conceptualizations of trust a n d
distrust in organizational science a n d the allied
social sciences. Furthermore, they suggest that
the threads connecting many of the different
trust-type constructs may be very thin, or even
nonexistent. Yet, a n extensive consideration of
the trust literature does seem to indicate a coherent theme. When the terms "trust" a n d "distrust" have been evoked in the social sciences,
they almost always have been associated with
the idea of actor vulnerability.
For instance, Mishra (1996) draws on Moorman, Zaltman, a n d Deshpande (1992) to make
the point that, in the absence of vulnerability,
the concept of trust is not necessary, since outcomes a r e not of consequence to trustors. Kee
a n d Knox (1970) suggest that the study of trust
involves situations where at least one party h a s
something meaningful a t stake a n d is cognizant
of the potential for betrayal a n d harm from the
other. Likewise, Gambetta claims that "for trust
to be relevant, there must be the possibility of
exit, betrayal, defection" (1988: 217). Similarly,
Coleman proposes that trust situations a r e
those "in which the risk one takes depends on
the performance of another actor" (1990: 91), a n d
Granovetter (1985) insists that the very nature of
trust provides the opportunity for trustee malfeasance. Moreover, many organizational scientists who have attempted to understand how
economic transactions come to be organized
(e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Bromiley & Cummings, 1995; Chiles & McMacklin, 1996; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996; Granovetter, 1985;
Nooteboom, 1996; Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997; Ring, 1996; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992;
Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995) view trust as a
mechanism that mitigates against the risk of
opportunistic behavior among those engaged in
various types of economic transactions.
In some instances scholars have embedded
the notion of vulnerability directly within their
trust definitions (e.g., Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Mishra, 1996; Sabel, 1993; Zand, 1972).
For example, Mayer et al. propose that trust is
"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to
the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular

<-----Page 4----->408

Academy of Management Review

action important to the trustor, irrespective of
the ability to monitor or control that other party"
(1995: 712). Sabel employs the idea of vulnerability somewhat differently: "Trust is the mutual
confidence that no party to a n exchange will
exploit the other's vulnerability" (1993: 1133).
The above examples a r e far from exhaustive.
In fact, considered as a whole, the research on
the topic of trust appears to be premised on the
g e n e r a l i d e a that actors (e.g., individuals,
groups, organizations) become, in some ways,
vulnerable to one another as they interact in
social situations, relationships, or systems.
Trust h a s been viewed as a suitable label for
various constructs employed to understand different phenomena connected with the issue of
actor vulnerability.
Despite this common ground, the likelihood of
devising a universal conceptualization of trust
a n d distrust that i s useful for organizational science researchers appears low, for at least two
reasons. First, the idea of vulnerability itself h a s
been incorporated into projects in various ways.
Some scholars view trust as a willingness to be
vulnerable (Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996).
Shapiro (1987), however, views trust as actual
vulnerability when s h e e q u a t e s it with the
agency relationship. Other researchers conceive
of trust as a rational decision regarding the extent to which others are likely to cause harm
(e.g., Coleman, 1990; Gambetta, 1988). From this
perspective, willingness to be vulnerable or actual exposure to potential harm (e.g., when one
cooperates with another) may subsequently follow from the trust decision. In contrast, Rotter
(1980) attempts to explain how the dispositions
of different individuals lead them to react differently in a particular type of vulnerable circumstance (e.g., interactions with unfamiliar others),
a n d Zucker's (1986) notion of trust as a preconscious expectation suggests that vulnerability is
only salient to trustors after a trustee h a s
caused them harm.
Second, tenets of theory building indicate that
a universal conceptualization of trust a n d distrust may have difficulty attaining a sufficient
level of theoretical a n d empirical viability for
research purposes. Dubin (1978)emphasizes that
theory building must acknowledge the constraints of human cognitive ability. On the one
hand, given the extreme conceptual diversity
discussed above, a construct that incorporates
the relevant complexities presented by the var-

July

ious extant perspectives is likely to be cognitively overwhelming. On the other hand, a conceptualization that omits these complexities in
favor of a more abstract definition is likely to be
too obscure to suggest a specific array of concrete data to be collected in empirical investigations (cf., Osigweh, 1989). In other words, attempts to "stretch" trust to cover the extant
range of usages seem to be a t a n extremely high
risk of producing constructions that a r e either
too elaborate for theoretical purposes or relatively meaningless in the realm of empirical
observation.
Still, although the theme of vulnerability may
not necessarily result in a universally accepted
or particularly useful conceptualization of trust,
one can use it to help establish the current
boundaries of the topic area, a n d it also suggests a n explanation for the increasing use of
the term in organizational science research. As
organizational a r r a n g e m e n t s h a v e become
more complex, actors' vulnerabilities to one another have become broader a n d deeper, a n d
problems revolving around how actors cope
with t h e s e n e w conditions s e e m to h a v e
emerged as central concerns.

PROBLEMS O F TRUST AND DISTRUST
We present our basic organizing framework in
Table 1, in which we classify works on trust
according to their general problem focus: interactions among unfamiliar actors, interactions
among familiar actors within ongoing relationships, a n d organization of economic transactions. These categories emerged from our analysis of the trust literature a n d a r e based on
logical distinctions among the fundamental
problems addressed by trust researchers. The
first classification in the table contains work
that centers on social interactions among actors
who have not gathered information about-or
established affective bonds with-one another.
The next consists of research focused on interactions among those who have meaningful information about-or
e s t a b l i s h e d affective
bonds with-one
another. The final grouping
concerns work addressing the general question
of how economic transactions come to be governed structurally.

this framework w a s how finely tuned a catego-

rization of so many disparate works should be.
Our bias w a s to create as few categories as
possible, both for the sake of clarity a n d because it allowed u s to juxtapose more works of
authors from different disciplinary backgrounds
who have addressed similar issues. Thus, this

framework seemed to reflect the best level of
abstraction of researchers' problem foci. Employing these groupings, we discovered insights
that would not have been apparent using a system with narrower problem classes. Even so,
this classification system is intended to clarify

<-----Page 6----->410

a n d spur problem-focused research-not to confine it.
Although the system we propose is meant to
elucidate the general kinds of organizational
problems to which various conceptualizations of
trust a n d distrust thus far have been applied
a n d proven useful, we acknowledge that it i s not
the only problem-focused framework possible.
Moreover, we recognize that other problem formulations may suggest different insights a n d
alternative deployments of the trust literature.
This is not inconsistent with our main objective,
which i s to argue that knowledge of organizational phenomena where trust-type constructs
a r e concerned i s gained more effectively by att e n d i n g to researchers' common problems,
rather than by attempting to force those working
with widely disparate research perspectives
a n d objectives to adopt a common definition or
theory of trust.
The notion that scientific constructs, a n d the
theories they constitute, have utility to the extent that they contribute to our understanding of
the social phenomena they may be applied to
h a s been a central tenet of social science research (e.g., Dubin, 1978; Hempel 1965; Kaplan,
1964; Kerlinger, 1986). The value of the problemcentered scholarship that we espouse derives
from a re-emphasis of this fundamental idea in
conjunction with the acknowledgment that trust
researchers have developed different trust constructs to address disparate sets of questions. Its
practical utility results from the strategies it presents to scholars for effectively a n d coherently
employing the enormous volume of trust literature in their efforts to address the specific issues
in which they a r e interested. We will highlight
some of these strategies throughout the remainder of the article.
Before elaborating on the trust problems contained in the table, we need to note that several
prominent works familiar to readers do not uppear there. We have omitted some of these because they address a problem not usually considered within the purview of organizational
science: the problem of social order-broadly
considered (e.g., Barber, 1983; Durkheim, 1933;
Garfinkel, 1963; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Parsons,
1967; Simmel, 1964).We excluded others because
they center solely on conceptualizations, measures, definitions, or critiques, without linking
their discussions to specific organizational
problems (e.g., Cook & Wall, 1980; Cummings,

July

Harnett, & Stevens, 1971; Hosmer, 1995; JohnsonGeorge & Swap, 1982; Williamson, 1993). Our
intention was to limit the works in the table to
those that address relatively specific problems
a n d that appear to have direct implications for
the organizational researcher.
In addition, while we have made every attempt to be comprehensive in citing organizationally focused work, the lengthy list must necessarily remain incomplete in allied areas, such
as person perception, negotiations, law, a n d so
forth. However, we hope we have provided at
least enough of a sample of these works to a s sist interested readers in further exploration of
these fields' approaches. The table, then, represents our attempt to provide a problem-focused
context for research a n d debate on the topic of
trust in organizational science.

Interactions Among Unfamiliar Actors
One major problem addressed by trust researchers pertains to interaction among unfamiliar actors-that is, actors who have little information a b o u t , or h a v e not e s t a b l i s h e d
affective bonds with, one another. Several different disciplinary perspectives a r e represented
here. We highlight three of the more prominent
a n d distinct perspectives pertinent to understanding interactions among relative strangers
in this section, in order to demonstrate the utility
of the framework. Previous typologies typically
would have considered them separately.
The first perspective, involving dispositional
theories of trust, assumes that factors exist
within individuals that predispose them to trust
or distrust others, whom they do not know. The
central issues for these types of models revolve
around the questions of how individuals develop their propensities to trust a n d how these
predilections affect their thoughts a n d actions
(e.g., Hardin, 1993; Rotter, 1967, 1971, 1980). Rotter's (1967, 1971, 1980) research on trust is the
most representative of this category a n d h a s
been among the most widely recognized a n d
acknowledged work in the organizational studies literature on the topic. He posits that trust is
a fairly stable belief based on individuals' extrapolations from their early-life experiences.
Further, h e suggests that the strength of trust's
impact on behavior is a function of the situational novelty with which people a r e confronted.
According to Rotter, as situations become in-

<-----Page 7----->1998

Bigley and Pearce

creasingly unfamiliar to individuals, the influence that their trusting dispositions have over
their behavior grows. Put another way, as people become more acquainted with specific others, their personal knowledge of those others
becomes the primary driver of their thoughts
a n d actions.
Another example is provided by Hardin (1993),
who recently argued that those who develop a
distrusting predisposition tend to avoid cooperative activities (because they expect to be exploited in such ventures), so a r e apt to have
fewer positive interactional experiences that
can function to adjust somewhat initial distrust
levels. By their own actions, these people contribute to perpetuating their distrusting predilections. In organizations those who distrust
may be expected to seek roles that have limited
dependencies on others or to resist job changes
that cause them to be more reliant on coworkers.
A second major approach to understanding
trust among unfamiliar actors can be called "behavioral decision theory." Like dispositional
models, many behavioral decision theories a d dress questions associated with the interaction
of unfamiliar others (although many also have
implications for ongoing relationships a n d ,
thus, we include them in the following problem
category as well). In contrast to the dispositional
approaches, however, these frameworks tend to
focus on immediate situational factors in the
context of game settings a n d posit that "trusting" is a function of relatively rational decisionmaking processes (e.g., Axelrod, 1984; Deutsch,
1958, 1960; Deutsch & Krauss, 1962; Loomis, 1959;
Matthews, Kordonski, & Shimoff, 1983), rather
than personality characteristics. Typically, they
define or operationalize trust a n d distrust in
terms of cooperative a n d competitive behavior,
respectively, a n d they usually attempt to ascertain how changes in the game affect these behaviors. Although behavioral decision theories
have been used to investigate relationships of
varying lengths, much of the research pertains
to situations where partners a r e strangers. According to Good (1988), some of the situations
that have been linked to trusting behaviors include those where the long-term interests of the
participants were stressed initially (e.g., Pruitt &
Kimmel, 1976),where only small initial rewards
were at stake (Deutsch & Krauss, 1962), where
there w a s no potential for threat (Deutsch &
Krauss, 1962).a n d where there w a s great poten-

41 1

tial for successful communication (e.g., Wichman, 1970).
Institutional frameworks represent a third
prominent approach. Like behavioral decision
theories, these models emphasize the causal
role of situational factors in fostering trust
among strangers. However, they a r e typically
concerned with the effects of organizational a n d
institutional structures a n d processes. Shapiro
(1987),for instance, concentrates on the problem
of how certain conditions necessary for economic exchange a r e maintained. She defines
trust as "a social relationship in which principals-for whatever reason or state of mindinvest resources, authority, or responsibility in
another on their behalf for some uncertain future return" (1987: 626). These principal-agent
relationships allow individuals, groups, or organizations to bridge the extreme social a n d
physical distances occurring in a complex industrialized society so that they may obtain the
benefits of more extensive trade with strangers.
Since principals regularly find themselves in
situations where they cannot specify, scrutinize,
evaluate, or constrain the performance of those
on whom they depend, certain social mechanisms (e.g., procedural norms, selection criteria,
risk-spreading devices-all
of which Shapiro
calls "guardians of trust") function to maintain
trust. In the aggregate, "the guardians of trust
offer a mix of normative prescriptions, socialization practices, institutional arrangements, structural constraints, a n d networking strategies designed to maintain the integrity of agency
relationships" (Shapiro, 1987: 635).
Zucker (1986) also emphasizes economic exchange a n d attempts to explain the emergence
of specific social structures a n d processes in the
United States' economy. She describes how certain institutional arrangements (e.g., rational
bureaucratic organizations, the professions, regulations, a n d laws) have developed for the purpose of producing the trust required to support
complex economic systems. For example, rationa l bureaucratic organizations generate common
expectations (i.e., trust) through written rules
a n d formal hierarchy in order to support transactions within a n d between organizations.
Thus, the bureaucratic organizational form is a n
example of a trust-producing mechanism for situations where the scale a n d scope of economic
activity overwhelm interpersonal trust relations.
Pearce, Bigley, a n d Branyiczki (in press) tested

<-----Page 8----->412

Academy of Management Review

several of these ideas, finding that, indeed, relatively more bureaucratic organizational practices a r e associated with greater participant
trust.
Both Shapiro (1987) a n d Zucker (1986) focus on
understanding which organizational a n d institutional arrangements produce trust among
strangers. Although works such as these typically have originated in sociologists' interest in
explaining why certain modern organizational
forms arise, such researchers as Xin a n d Pearce
(1996) more recently have extended this work to
questions of how individuals working in societies without stable modernist institutions sustain
their organizations through aggressive use of
personal trust relationships.
The three perspectives on trust (dispositional,
behavioral decision, a n d institutional) we discuss above offer potential insights into understanding organizational situations involving the
interaction of unfamiliar actors. By focusing on
different levels a n d units of analysis, they each
a r e suggestive of a different locus of explanation for trust among strangers: trustors' personalities, relatively more proximal situational factors (e.g., "rules of the game"), a n d relatively
more distal contextual elements (i.e., organizational or societal structures a n d processes).
Particular applications-either
individually
or in combination-of
the trust models contained in this class may depend, to a large extent, on the more specific components of the
problem under investigation. For example, both
institutional a n d behavioral decision theory a p proaches tend to emphasize different components of actors' situations in their explanations
of behavior, whereas dispositional models focus
on stable psychological elements to predict individuals' actions in novel circumstances.
Therefore, a determination of the situational
strength (cf., Mischel, 1973) facing the actors being studied may help investigators select the
framework(s) that would be most useful. If the
objective i s to explain initial levels of cooperation among strangers trying to form new associations in the absence of influential contextual
factors, then dispositional models may be the
most useful theories to use when addressing the
issue.
In addition to assisting researchers select the
work that may have the most potential for a n swering their specific questions, problemfocused scholarship can help them ascertain

July

where theoretical debate a n d empirical testing
would be beneficial. As one example, Rotter
(1967, 1971, 1980) a n d Hardin (1993) appear to
make competing claims regarding the conditions under a n d the extent to which dispositions
to trust a r e malleable. Rotter's work indicates
that the trusting (or distrusting) personality
characteristic is quite fixed, once it h a s been
established in one's relatively early life. Hardin,
however, a r g u e s that t h e predilection to
(dis)trust is, at least partially, a function of individuals' own behavior. In particular, since distrustors tend to avoid cooperative situations,
they do not provide themselves with enough opportunities to modify their basic inclinations to
view others generally as untrustworthy. So, for
instance, if the specific research issue involves
whether distrusting dispositions can be modified through organizational interventions (e.g.,
compelling individuals to work with unfamiliar
others on a series of project teams), a test of
these two theories seems warranted.
Grouping approaches to trust according to
their problem focus can help distinguish useful
frameworks a n d identify a r e a s where debate
a n d testing a r e worthwhile. The possibilities
that this approach suggests a r e not readily apparent through the use of disciplinary-based topological systems alone.

Interactions Among Familiar Actors
As we stated previously, this problem category consists of research focused on interactions
among actors who have accumulated meaningful knowledge about, or established affective
bonds with, one another. This classification
comprises the largest grouping of organization
a n d organization-related trust a n d distrust
work, a n d it includes studies of relationships a t
various levels of analysis. Some of these investigations focus on interpersonal relationships
(e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995); others
highlight relations among different groups, organizations, or classes (e.g., Dodgson, 1993; Fox,
1974; Lorenz, 1992, 1993; Sabel, 1993).In addition,
although most of this research h a s emphasized
trust constructs, recent work increasingly h a s
been accentuating distrust conceptualizations
(e.g., Bies & Tripp, 1996; Fein & Hilton, 1994;
Kramer, 1994; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin &
Stickel, 1996). A consideration of all of the various relationship levels would be beyond the

<-----Page 9----->1998

Bigley and Pearce

scope of this article. Instead, we focus primarily
on interpersonal interactions in this section as a
way of showing the usefulness of the approach.
Researchers whose works have been grouped
here typically have conceptualized trust as a
state of mind. However, although there appears
to be substantial consensus on this point, there
is much less agreement when it comes to the
more precise formulations of trust that have
emerged over the last several years. One of the
most contested issues along these lines relates
to whether trust i s exclusively the product of
individuals' calculative decision making processes or is emotion based.
The conceptualizations set forth by Gambetta
(1988) a n d Coleman (1990) a r e fairly representative of the rational choice viewpoint. Gambetta
contends, for instance, that some agent A trusts
some other agent B, when A calculates that the
probability of B performing a n action that is
beneficial, or at least not detrimental, to A i s
high enough for A to consider engaging in some
form of cooperation with B. Similarly, Coleman
argues that situations of trust can be viewed as
a subset of those involving risk: "The elements
confronting the potential trustor a r e nothing
more or less than the considerations a rational
actor applies in deciding whether to place a bet"
(Coleman, 1990: 99).
Other researchers, however, have argued that
trust i s a product of peoples' emotions, at least to
some extent (e.g., Holmes, 1991; Johnson-George
& Swap, 1982; Lewicki & Bunker, 1995a,b; Mayer
et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995; Rempel, Holmes, &
Zanna, 1985; Ring, 1996). Furthermore, empirical
work seems to support the distinction between
these rational a n d emotional bases of trust. For
example (and as we mentioned above), research
conducted by McAllister (1995),with a sample of
managers a n d professionals, distinguishes between cognition- a n d affect-based trust. He also
suggests that cognition-based trust is a n antecedent of affect-based trust.
Holmes (1991) presents a somewhat different
kind of relationship between calculative a n d
emotional processes in his trust theory. In his
developmental framework of trust in close relationships, h e posits that existing states of trust
affect people's perceptions a n d evaluations of
their partners a n d function to inhibit the calculative aspects of trust decisions. Trust forestalls
the monitoring a n d evaluating of a partner's
behavior. In fact, Holmes suggests, "A trusting

413

relationship can probably be recognized by the
absence of a n active appraisal process in the
normal course of events" (1991: 82). Therefore,
although there is some agreement that the psychological nature of trust in ongoing relationships involves a decision based on information
about the other a n d the situation, there is considerable debate over whether-and
in what
form-emotional processes are involved.
We contend that the best approach to these
types of disputes is, again, to attend to researchers' specific organizational problems. For example, decision-based conceptualizations of trust
may be quite useful for problems involving interactions taking place within contexts that
present actors with salient a n d harsh penalties
for untrustworthy behavior. One illustration i s
Coleman's (1990) investigation of the problem of
how close communities allow diamond dealers
in London a n d New York to engage in transactions worth considerable sums of money solely
on the basis of verbal agreements. He concludes
that the communities in which these transactions take place support interactions of this sort
because they effectively disseminate information regarding a trustee's reputation to all those
on whom he or she must rely for business in the
future. This particular problem may call for a
purely rational choice perspective on trust. In
other circumstances, where personal relationships are expected to be particularly strong a n d
situational factors relatively weak, one of the
trust theories that involves emotional elements
may be most predictive.
In some instances, however, conceptualizations of trust or distrust may be competing to
answer the same research questions. Here, direct empirical testing may be called for to determine which is preferred. Mayer et al. (1995)a n d
McAllister (1995). for instance, represent a case
where a head-to-head test would seem to be
appropriate. Both works provide carefully argued, literature-grounded trust models attempting to account for approximately the same types
of organizational phenomena. However, they
are contradictory on key points. One of the most
fundamental discrepancies between the two
pertains to the dimensionality of the trust construct. Mayer et al. view trust in unidimensional
terms, conceptualizing it as a willingness to be
vulnerable based on reasoned judgment. As
mentioned previously, McAllister distinguishes
among two kinds of trust (cognition a n d affect

<-----Page 10----->414

Academy of Marnagement Review

based), which seem to have different antecedents, a n d they appear to differentially affect certain work-related behaviors.
Given that these two theories seem to have
been intended to address the s a m e sorts of
problems, empirical attention to theoretical
discrepancies a p p e a r s warranted. Tests pitting these two trust theories a g a i n s t e a c h
other to predict important work behaviors,
such as employee citizenship or coworker cooperation, would help researchers determine
which best advances our understanding of organizational behavior.
Similar logic applies to the trust-distrust issue
emerging in organizational science. Although
many researchers seem to regard these terms as
labels for antithetical or mutually exclusive concepts, some scholars have used the terms to
identify more independent constructs (e.g.,
Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin & Stickel,
1996).Here again, the differences between these
two types of theories a r e problematic only to the
extent that they attempt to address the same
problems. The questions asked by Sitkin a n d
Roth (1993), for instance, center on why organizations' legalistic responses to trust-type problems often have unintended, negative consequences. Debate a n d empirical testing pitting
their perspective against distrust-as-the-opposite-of-trust formulations a r e required, to the degree that the latter can be effectively applied to
Sitkin a n d Roth's specific concerns.
Finally, grouping organizational trust research according to problems highlights certain
a r e a s begging for integrative research. One
such example i s the lengthy list of antecedents
employed by various researchers investigating
ongoing relationships with constructs labeled
"trust" or "distrust." These antecedents include
the other's reputation for trustworthiness (Jarillo,
1988). symbolic exchange (Haas & Deseran,
1981), transformational leadership (Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, & Bommer, 1996).openness (Butler &
Cantrell, 1984),a n d organizational development
programs (Kegan & Rubenstein, 1973). For some
purposes it may be useful to include many of
these in a single project. Must certain combinations of them be present in minimal amounts
before a n ongoing relationship can be sustained? Are some substitutes for one another?
This seems to be a valuable area for future re-

organization of Economic Transactions

Research in this problem class centers on the
general question of how economic transactions
come to be governed structurally. Scholars in
the transaction cost economics tradition originally addressed this issue (cf., Coase 1937; Commons, 1934; Williamson 1975, 1985). More recently, scientists from other organizational
research perspectives have become increasingly interested in problems of transaction governance (e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Bromiley &
Cummings, 1995; Granovetter, 1985; Ring & Van
d e Ven, 1992).
From the basic transaction cost economics
viewpoint, the transaction-that is, the transference of a good or service across a technologically separable interface (Williamson, 1985:
1)-is regarded as the fundamental unit of analysis. Researchers typically analyze how transactions of different types become aligned with
various governance structures (e.g., market, hierarchy, or hybrid) in ways that supposedly minimize their costs. When researchers consider intra- and interorganizational relationships, they
view them within the context of transaction
costs and transaction governance.
In early works on this problem (cf., Williamson, 1975),scholars identified trust as a phenomenon that could affect certain kinds of governance costs. Recently, a number of scholars
have attempted to formulate trust constructs
a n d specify their functions relative to the basic
tenets of transaction cost economics (e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989;Bromiley & Cummings, 1995;
Chiles & McMacklin, 1996; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996; Granovetter, 1985; Nooteboom, 1996;
Nooteboom et al., 1997; Ring, 1996; Ring & Van d e
Ven, 1992; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). For example, Bromiley a n d Cummings (1995; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996) have developed a conceptualization a n d measure of trust a n d tried to
demonstrate how it may affect transaction governance. Along similar lines, Nooteboom et al.
(1997) argue that their trust construct interacts
with governance structures to influence the perception of risk for agents of firms in alliances.
Ring and Van d e Van (1992) focus on how their
notion of trust affects the structure of interfirm
relationships.
Some theorists employ their trust concepts as
a basis for critiquing the assumptions a n d theories of transaction cost economics itself. Bra-

<-----Page 11----->1998

Bigley and Pearce

dach a n d Eccles (1989).for instance, regard trust
as a n alternative control mechanism, along with
price a n d authority, a n d they contend that trust,
price, a n d authority often coexist as governance
devices within organizations. Another example
is Granovetter (1985), who criticizes Williamson's (1975) theory for not considering that economic activity is typically embedded in networks of social relations, which involve trust.
Researchers whose works we group into this
category have used several different types of
trust constructs to address a variety of specific
transaction governance concerns. For example,
Bradach a n d Eccles (1989) conceive of trust as a
calculated decision by one party regarding the
likelihood that another will cause harm. Ring
a n d Van d e Ven, however, in their work (Ring,
1996; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992), conceptualize
trust as being grounded in affect-based or relational factors, such as goodwill a n d benevolence. Their intention i s to explain transaction
governance between firms engaged in collaborative activities.
Consistent with our central argument, we contend that the discrepancies between these a p proaches require attention to the extent that
they are applicable to the same particular problem sets. Since Bradach a n d Eccles (1989)specifically indicate that their view of trust is approp r i a t e for u n d e r s t a n d i n g both intra- a n d
interfirm transaction governance, we believe
theoretical debate a n d empirical testing a r e especially warranted on problems emphasizing
transactions between firms. Testing may involve specific questions concerning, for example, which conceptualization best explains the
governance structure a n d stability of transactions between organizations engaged in multinational joint ventures.
Applying trust constructs to the problem of
transaction governance i s a relatively recent occurrence in the organization studies literature.
Although their central concern h a s been the organization of transactions, many of the researchers using a transaction cost economics
perspective have attempted to demonstrate how
the organization of transactions within a n economic system is dependent, at least partially, on
the quality of interpersonal, intergroup, or interorganizational relationships. Consequently, the
research in this category i s somewhat less selfcontained than that of the two other problem
areas. For this reason these theorists seem to be

415

at particular risk of applying conceptualizations
of trust originally developed to address problems quite different from their own, without a d equate care in specifying the logical connections between the problems.

PROBLEM-CENTERED ORGANIZATION 

SCIENCE RESEARCH 

Social science researchers striving to address
divergent sets of problems from different perspectives have defined trust a n d distrust in a
variety of ways a n d at various levels of abstraction. A consideration of the works of previous
scholars, who attempted to organize the trust
literature according to theory types (i.e., Bromiley & Cummings, 1995; Hosmer, 1995; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1995a,b; Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth,
1993), reveals that the conceptual diversity
among trust constructs is considerable. We have
examined several prominent works to illustrate
the degree of the diversity. Rotter (1980), for instance, views trust as a personality characteristic, whereas Gambetta (1988) suggests it i s a
rational decision. Alternatively, Zucker (1986)
conceives of it as a preconscious expectation. In
her work Shapiro (1987) equates the principalagent relation to trust. These are not trivial differences.
Although the theme of actor vulnerability may
represent the common ground of trust research,
the degree of diversity in the literature nevertheless seems to preclude the possibility of a
useful universal definition. We have argued that
efforts to incorporate existing trust perspectives
under one conceptualization a r e likely to result
in concepts that are either unreasonably complex or inordinately abstract for organizational
science research purposes. In addition, attempts
to force disparate approaches together may result in misapplications of previous approaches.
For instance, Rotter is explicit in his contention that dispositional trust h a s predictive
power only in novel situations-that is, where
individuals have little information about the obj e c t ( ~of
) their trust. Mayer et al. (1995) cite Rotter's research a n d incorporate a dispositional
moderator in their model of one person's trust in
another at work. However, their model neglects
the situational ambiguity condition discussed
by Rotter. The personality factor included in the
Mayer et al. model is expected to function independently of the trustor's familiarity with the

<-----Page 12----->416

Academy of Man,agement Review

trustee. Although such a dispositional element
ultimately may prove useful, it is not Rotter's
dispositional trust.
In view of what may be unresolvable differences among trust constructs, a n d in line with
Kaplan's (1964) quote at the beginning of this
article, we have presented a n approach intended to assist researchers in managing the
conceptual diversity. Our framework h a s several specific benefits. First, it provides a basis
for organizational scholars to delimit the enormous volume of trust research to that which is
pertinent to their specific research questions.
Scholars should not be compelled to discuss definitions a n d theories focused on problems far
removed from their own, simply because those
also use the word "trust." The general categories
of organizational problems that we propose represent a n initial set of decision rules for this
task. The more specific questions employed in
research may further circumscribe the body of
relevant works.
Second, our framework helps to distinguish
debates that would appear to be beneficial from
those that would seem to be less functional. We
have suggested that the models presented by
McAllister (1995) a n d Mayer et al. (1995) appear
to address very similar problems. Therefore, theoretical debate a n d empirical testing designed
to establish which i s the most predictive framework would seem justified. However, the problems addressed by McAllister (1995) a n d Zucker
(1986),for example, appear to have problem foci
that a r e so dissimilar that efforts to identify the
best theory between these two would not be
warranted (and, indeed, would be irrelevant to
problem-focused organizational research).
In other words, discussions in the a r e a of trust
that a r e not anchored in problems a r e likely to
lead to unproductive debates. For example, Williamson (19931, a n economist, attempts to marshal a careful a n d comprehensive critique of the
use of trust in organizational science. He focuses
on the works of sociologists, such as Coleman
(1990)a n d Gambetta (1988),as those most representative of the literature on the topic. Williamson argues that if trust reduces simply to a decision u n d e r risk (as explicitly s t a t e d by
Coleman, for example), then trust as a scientific
construct should be abandoned in favor of the
more suitable conceptual machinery found in
transaction cost economics.

July

Williamson writes, "[Ilt is redundant at best
a n d can be misleading to use the term 'trust' to
describe commercial exchange for which costeffective safeguards have been devised in support of more efficient exchange" (1993: 463). Citi n g Dunn's (1988) work, Williamson d o e s
acknowledge a type of trust that is based on
people's emotions (which he terms "personal
trust" or "nearly noncalculative trust"), only to
dismiss it as irrelevant to commercial exchange
relationships. He argues that because personal
trust involves switching out of a rational decision-making mode, it "is warranted only for very
special personal relations that would be seriously degraded if a calculative orientation were
'permitted.' Commercial relations do not qualify" (Williamson, 1993: 486). Williamson's position-that personal trust does not, or should not,
operate in economic realms-sharply contrasts
with that of other organizational scholars, who
consider the emotion-laden aspects of interpersonal relationships (e.g., Lewicki & Bunker,
1995a,b; Mayer et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995) to
figure prominently in organizational behavior.
Thus, Williamson h a s staked out a provocative position-the conventional economist's critique of sociology as a discipline, as well as a
dismissal of the role of emotions in organizationa l relationships-one that flies in the face of the
work of many organizational behavior scholars.
Such strong statements may serve as a n invitation to counterargument by a t least some of the
many whose understanding of trust Williamson
(1993)h a s dismissed. However, the lack of a specific problem focus in Williamson's critique undermines much of the potential for productive
debate. In the absence of a concrete problem,
disputants have no effective means for evaluating the usefulness of various constructs against
one another. In other words, since definitions or
theories of trust have developed to address different kinds of organizational problems, general
criticisms of this sort typically a r e not beneficial.
A third benefit of problem-centered scholarship on the topic of trust is that it invites consideration of alternative perspectives rooted in different disciplinary traditions. This is evident
when employing our framework in conjunction
with any of the previous approaches mentioned
earlier. For example, particular works grouped
into three of the four categories proposed by
Sitkin a n d Roth (1993)-that is, trust as a n indi-

<-----Page 13----->1998

Bigley a n d Pearce

vidual attribute, trust as a behavior, a n d trust as
a n institutional arrangement-can be brought
to bear on our problems of interactions among
unfamiliar actors. The same point can be made
when using our approach together with the
works of other scholars, such as Bromiley a n d
Cummings (19951, Hosmer (1995). Lewicki a n d
Bunker (1995a,b),or Mishra (1996).In this regard,
our approach encourages a sort of comprehensiveness in the use of the literature, but one that
centers on specific issues or questions.
Finally, the problem-centered framework we
propose calls attention to the distinctiveness of
trust constructs a n d suggests that, since various
conceptualizations of trust may answer different
sorts of questions, it may be more profitable to
use them in conjunction with one another, rather
than to invariably a n d forcibly integrate them.
For example, one research problem of interest
may involve understanding the dynamic development of cooperative behaviors of organizationa l members during their first year of employment. For this problem it may be useful to
consider using both Rotter's (1980) a n d Gambetta's (1988) theory. Since Rotter designed his
model to explain behavior in situations where
actors interact with unfamiliar others, it may be
most predictive during the initial weeks of employment. Gambetta's model could be the basis
for hypotheses about cooperation in l a t e r
months, since h e intended it to explain actors'
behaviors in situations where they have some
familiarity with one another a n d with situational constraints. Certainly, when joining different theories of trust, one must identify their
boundary conditions. This may be accomplished
through logical bridging statements, which a r e
propositions that develop theoretical relationships between existing perspectives (Cappelli &
Shere, 1991; House, Rousseau, & Thomas-Hunt,
1995).
Again, we a r e not arguing that our framework
i s the only problem-centered one possible. Certainly, other such typologies may provide additional insights. Still, the categories that we identify reflect the general kinds of problems that
have been addressed by those employing trust
constructs, a n d they should provide a reasonable starting point for most investigations. Furthermore, we a r e not contending that scholars
can never benefit from considering work outside
their specific problem focus. However, we advocate that very special attention should be given

417

to the rationale justifying the use of such material.
In conclusion, whether because of its nonscientific origins or its wide-ranging appeal as a
social science construct label, the term "trust"
h a s taken on a n array of diverse meanings in
organizational science. Since the area seems to
be fundamentally fragmented in its problems
a n d approaches, straining for a shared meaning
of trust in the organizational sciences is likely to
be a relatively unproductive endeavor. We have
attempted to demonstrate that the most relevant
criterion for assessing the viability of a conceptualization is the extent to which it is useful in
addressing particular organizational problems
or issues. We hope that this framework h a s
helped to alert readers to the substantial intellectual differences in conceptual uses of trust in
organizational science a n d that it will encoura g e them to worry less about attacks on their
definitions or the lengths of their reference lists
a n d more about meaningful organizational
problems.
