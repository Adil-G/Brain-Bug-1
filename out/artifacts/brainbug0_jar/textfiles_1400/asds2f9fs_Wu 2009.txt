Causal knowledge based on causal analysis can advance the quality of decision-making and thereby facilitate a process of transforming strategic objectives into effective actions. Several creditable studies have
emphasized the usefulness of causal analysis techniques. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is one
of several popular causal analysis techniques. However, one difﬁculty often faced when we commence
research is that the causal direction is unknown due to the lack of background knowledge. To solve this
difﬁculty, this paper proposes a method that links the Bayesian network and PLS path modeling for causal
analysis. An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. Based on
the ﬁndings of this study, conclusions and implications for management are discussed.

1. Introduction
In recent years, knowledge management and related strategy
concepts are often promoted as important components of organizations’ survival strategies (Martensson, 2000). Knowledge management is regarded as a key source of sustainable competitive
advantage (Holsapple & Singh, 2001; Liao, 2003), and is also seen
as playing a fundamental role in the process of transforming individual knowledge into organizational knowledge (Liebowitz,
2001).
Knowledge is generally considered as intangible, and is difﬁcult
to measure, but it is generally accepted that it sometimes increases
through use (Wiig, Hoog, & Spek, 1997). More importantly, for the
purpose of advancing the quality of decision-making and thereby
facilitating a process of transforming strategic objectives into effective actions, causal knowledge based on causal analysis is needed
(Lin & Wu, 2008; Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004; Tan & Platts, 2003).
Several creditable studies have placed emphasis on the usefulness
of causal analysis techniques. Tan and Platts (2003) conduct an
appraisal of causal analysis techniques ranging from ﬁshbone
(Ishikawa) diagrams, Why/Why diagrams, inﬂuence diagrams,
mind maps, to cognitive maps. In an especially relevant study,
Lin and Wu (2008) implement a fuzzy DEMATEL method to produce a causal diagram. In addition, Bayesian networks and PLS path
modeling are popular causal analysis techniques. Through these
causal analysis techniques, causal maps can be created. Causal
maps represent the causal knowledge of subjects in a speciﬁc
domain, and they have been applied widely in the areas of policy
analysis and management sciences to demonstrate the relation* Tel.: +886 3 5927700x2902; fax: +886 3 5925715.

ships between relevant factors, knowledge, and conditions
(Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004).
Among causal analysis techniques, the PLS path modeling is
particularly famous for its successful applications in customer satisfaction analysis; both the American Customer Satisfaction Index
(ACSI) and the European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) were
constructed using PLS path modeling. However, many researchers
and experts have experienced a certain amount of difﬁculty
regarding how to establish the causal directions between constructs, due to lack of background knowledge or previous theoretical support. To deal with this difﬁculty, this paper proposes using
the Bayesian network prior to implementing PLS path modeling for
causal analysis.
The Bayesian network is a causal map, a kind of graphical representation of an expert’s knowledge, based on probability theory
(Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004). The Bayesian network enjoys the
advantage that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions: it graphically displays as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and represents a
set of conditional independence constraints among a given number
of variables and their related conditional probability distributions
(Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). Because of the special nature and merit
of the Bayesian network, the DAG can serve as a guide to help us
decide the causal directions between constructs when using PLS
path modeling. This paper, therefore, suggests a method that links
the Bayesian network and PLS path modeling for causal analysis.
An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of
the proposed method. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows. In Section 2, the proposed method is presented. In Section 3, the Bayesian network and PLS path modeling are discussed.
In Section 4, an empirical study is presented by way of illustration.
Finally, based on the ﬁndings of this research, conclusions and
implications for management are presented.

2. The proposed method
According to Al-Tabtabai (1998), causal knowledge is a kind of
knowledge structure which is concerned with the conﬁguration
of a given system and the way its components work together to
perform a speciﬁc task. Through the use of a causal analysis technique we may obtain a causal map where causal knowledge is
exhibited. A causal map is a kind of compact diagram, which captures causal knowledge by picturing relationships among concepts
connected with labeled arrows. It is also a method for visualizing
the relationships among different concepts within a downwardbranching hierarchical structure. A causal map, with its embedded
causal knowledge, is an important and useful tool, because it helps
us stimulate the generation of ideas, promote creativity, communicate complex concepts, and transform an individual’s tacit knowledge into a team’s explicit knowledge.
Lin and Wu (2008) note that: (1) cause and effect are two different concepts; (2) causes tell the reason why something happened,
whereas effects are the results of that happening; and (3) to capture the cause–effect relationship is not an easy task, because the
interaction between cause and effect is often complex and subtle.
Fortunately, several causal analysis techniques can be used to produce causal maps (Lin & Wu, 2008; Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004; Tan
& Platts, 2003). Among them, the Bayesian network and PLS path
modeling are vital, trend-setting techniques. The former is currently gaining importance as a data mining technique, while the
latter is becoming popular as a modeling method.
Many studies have attempted to advance the usefulness of the
Bayesian network. Barrientos and Vargas (1998) combine Bayesian
networks and case-based reasoning to create a knowledge representation scheme capable of dealing with time-varying processes;
Sucar and Martínez-Arroyo (1998) propose a hybrid approach for
structure learning of Bayesian networks; Garside, Rhodes, and
Holmes (1999) discuss the efﬁcient estimation of missing information in causal inverted multiway trees, and propose a simpliﬁed
Maximum Entropy model; Kang and Golay (1999) present a Bayesian network-based advisory system for operational availability in
complex nuclear power plant systems; Nadkarni and Shenoy
(2001) present a Bayesian network approach to making inferences
in causal maps; Jurgelenaite and Lucas (2005) propose a method of
using equivalence classes of binomial distributions as a means to
deﬁne very large Bayesian networks; Viaene, Dedene, and Derrig
(2005) use Bayesian learning neural networks for auto claim fraud
detection; Liu, Sung, and Mittal (2006) propose a semi-ﬁxed model
to represent the gene network as a Bayesian network with hidden
variables; Cho (2006) uses the linear Bayesian approach to update
the distribution of activity duration; Lauria and Duchessi (2007)
suggest a methodology for developing Bayesian networks; De Melo
and Sanchez (2008) present a knowledge-based representation for
maintenance project delays, etc.
As for PLS path modeling, it has been successfully applied to a
variety of areas, such as: exploring the human side of client/server
system success (Guimaraes & Igbaria, 1997); examining the impact
of poor performance on risk-taking attitudes (Lee, 1997); investigating effects of source and participant anonymity and difference in initial pinions in an EMS context (Kahai, Avolio, & Sosik, 1998);
performing the technological aspect of environmental scanning
(Raymond, Julien, & Ramangalahy, 2001); examining the impact of
shared domain knowledge and its unit structure (Ranganathan &
Sethi, 2002); satisfying and retaining customers through independent service representatives (Brown & Chin, 2004); discussing the
extensions of PLS path modeling (Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin, &
Lauro, 2005); testing the inﬂuence of technology on user expectancies (Looney, 2006); investigating the relationship between
interpersonal trust, employee satisfaction, and employee loyalty
(Matzler & Renzl, 2006); deﬁning relationship quality for

Edvardsson, 2006); arguing the error term in formative measurement models (Diamantopoulos, 2006); examining the determinants
of students’ satisfaction and their perceived learning outcomes
(Eom, Wen, & Ashill, 2006); arguing the issue of strategic sourcing
(Kocabasoglu & Suresh, 2006); making decisions for resource allocation (Andreou & Bontis, 2007); assessing the performance of business unit managers (Bouwens & Vanlent, 2007); performing a
modiﬁed PLS path modeling algorithm handling reﬂective categorical variables (Jakobowicz & Derquenne, 2007); examining the role of
problem recognition and cognitive bias (Keil, Depledge, & Rai,
2007); discussing competitive and cooperative positioning in supply chain logistics relationships (Klein, Rai, & Straub, 2007); and discussing the relationships among latent variables and residuals in
PLS path modeling (Vittadini, Minotti, Fattore, & Lovaglio, 2007);
performing a trust-based consumer decision-making model in electronic commerce (Kim, Ferrin, & Rao, 2008); developing an index for
online customer satisfaction (Hsu, 2008), and so on.
However, few studies have dealt with the issue of ‘theory
dependency’. Regarding theory dependency, the Bayesian network
is data driven with no restrictions, while PLS path modeling is
based on theory (Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). If one uses PLS path
modeling in a situation lacking a previous theory, serious problems
arise. For example, the task of deciding the causal direction between constructs would become excessively complicated because
we need to guess at a huge number of possibilities in terms of causal directions between several constructs. To solve this problem,
this paper proposes an effective way to implement the Bayesian
network prior to conducting PLS path modeling. Using the proposed method, the execution of PLS path modeling, according to
the DAG of the Bayesian network, can be performed smoothly
and effectively. For this scenario, the proposed method is shown
in Fig. 1. Before carrying out the causal analysis, software preparation is needed. For this purpose, there are a number of free
software packages available, such as ‘WEKA’ for the Bayesian network, and ‘SmartPLS’ for PLS path modeling.
The proposed method for causal analysis consists of four
phases: ‘Data preparation’, ‘Bayesian network’, ‘PLS path modeling’,
and ‘Synthesization and application’. Data preparation is the preparation phase, in which we are required to cleanse and format the
data for the use of the chosen software. The next step is to employ
‘WEKA’ to obtain a DAG through Bayesian network classiﬁers with
a search algorithm. Based on the DAG, the PLS path modeling phase
can be implemented with ‘SmartPLS’. Finally, synthesization and
application are conducted to support better decision-making and
to apply in problem-solving.

Popular data-mining techniques include K-means clustering,
decision trees, Bayesian networks, regression models, and neural
networks. Such data mining techniques are supported by the

software known as ‘WEKA’, a package which incorporates a large
number of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
WEKA provides a series of comprehensively practical utilities, such
as: Preprocess, Classify, Cluster, Associate, Select attributes, Visualize. Among data mining techniques, the use of the Bayesian network can produce a DAG that models causal relations between
attributes. Additionally, the software ‘SmartPLS’ excels at graphic
path modeling with latent variables. As described in the SmartPLS
manual, it is a software application to be used for structural equation modeling with a user-friendly graphical interface. More details
are as follows.
3.1. Bayesian networks
The Bayesian network is a graphical representation of probabilistic relationships between multiple attributes/variables
(Klopotek, 2002). It is more robust for inferring structure than
other methods because it is better resistant to noise in data (Wang,
Touchman, & Xue, 2004). Moreover, the Bayesian network incorporates probabilistic inference engines that support reasoning under
uncertainty (Hruschka & Ebecken, 2007). It is an outcome of a machine learning process that ﬁnds a given network’s structure and
its associated parameters, and it can provide diagnostic reasoning,
predictive reasoning, and intercausal reasoning (Lauria & Duchessi,
2007). A Bayesian network is a DAG that consists of a set of nodes/
vertices linked by arcs, in which the nodes represent the attributes
and the arcs stand for relationships among the connected attributes (Hruschka & Ebecken, 2007). In a DAG, the arcs designate
the existence of direct causal relations between the linked variables, and the strengths of these relationships are expressed in
terms of conditional probabilities.
Inferring Bayesian structure from expression data can be
viewed as a search problem in the network space (Wang et al.,
2004). Thus, to heuristically search the Bayesian network space,
it is necessary to employ a variety of search methods such as: simulated annealing algorithm, genetic algorithm, tree augmented
Naïve Bayes (TAN). For structure learning through Bayesian networks, the ‘WEKA’ offers various algorithms such as: hill climbing,
K2, simulated annealing, genetic, tabu, TAN, and so on. Among
these algorithms, the TAN can produce a causal-effect graph (not
just a tree-like graph) in which the class attribute treated as the
only and greatest parent node of all other nodes is located at the
top in the DAG (Friedman, Geiger, & Goldszmidt, 1997). The causal-effect graph of the TAN is formed by calculating the maximum
weight spanning tree using Chow and Liu’s method (1968).
The TAN is an extension of the Naïve Bayes: it removes the
Naïve Bayes assumption that all the attributes are independent.
Moreover, the TAN ﬁnds correlations among the attributes and
connects them in the network structure learning process. According to Friedman et al. (1997), the TAN provides for additional edges
between attributes that capture correlations among them, and it
approximates the interactions between attributes by using a tree
structure imposed on the Naïve Bayes structure. Davis, Costa,
Ong, Page, and Dutra (2004) note that (1) although the Naïve Bayes
is more straightforward to understand as well as easy and fast to
impart through training, the TAN, on the other hand, allows for
more complex network structures than the Naïve Bayes; and (2)
the TAN achieves retention of the basic structure of Naïve Bayes,
permitting each attribute to have at most one other parent, and
allowing the model to capture dependencies between attributes.
Bayesian network classiﬁers incorporated in WEKA, such as the
Bayesian network with the TAN search algorithm, have exhibited
excellent performance in data mining (Cerquides & De Mantaras,
2005). In fact, the conditional independence assumption of Naïve
Bayes is not real, and the TAN was developed to offset this disadvantage. It does achieve a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of clas-

siﬁcation accuracy, efﬁciency and model simplicity (Jiang, Zhang,
Cai, & Su, 2005). Although the TAN may not always perform the best
with regard to classiﬁcation accuracy, this study adopts the TAN because it can create a causal-effect graph in which the class attribute
treated as the supreme parent node is located at the top in the DAG.
3.2. PLS path modeling
PLS path modeling and LISREL (LInear Structural RELations) are
two main SEM (structural equation modeling) approaches to modeling relationships between latent variables (Tenenhaus et al.,
2005; Temme, Kreis, & Hildebrandt, 2006). The LISREL approach focuses on maximizing the explained covariation among the various
constructs, while PLS path modeling maximizes the explained variation among the various constructs (Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). Unlike LISREL, with its assumption of homogeneity in the observed
population, PLS path modeling is more suitable for real world
applications. It is particularly more advantageous to employ PLS
path modeling when models are complex (Fornell & Bookstein,
1982; Hulland, 1999). Moreover, a major merit of using PLS path
modeling is that its required minimum sample size is a mere 30
(Wixom & Watson, 2001).
Anderson and Vastag (2004) stress that the SEM is likely the
preferred method if the objective is only a description of theoretical constructs with no interest in inference to observable variables,
while the Bayesian network approach should be selected if objectives include prediction and diagnostics of observed variables.
Moreover, although both LISREL and PLS path modeling are SEM,
the former highlights theory conﬁrmation while the latter stresses
causal explanation (Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). More importantly,
PLS path modeling is more suited for analyzing exploratory models
with no rigorous theory grounding, it requires minimal assumptions about the statistical distributions of data sets, and it can work
with smaller sample sizes (Ranganathan & Sethi, 2002).
PLS path modeling handles two models at the same time: (1) a
measurement model called the outer model relating the MVs (manifest variables) to their own LVs (latent variables), and (2) a structural model called the inner model relating some endogenous LVs
to other LVs. The measurement model is tested by the reliability
and validity analyses, and the structural model is tested by path
coefﬁcients between constructs in the model (Matzler & Renzl,
2006). There are at least two important tasks in conducting PLS path
modeling: checking convergent reliability and validity, and explaining path coefﬁcients and predictive ability. Through PLS path modeling, we can obtain standardized regression coefﬁcients for the paths,
R2 values for endogenous variables, and factor loadings of indicators.

relationships and to take productive actions based on the causal
analysis (Lin & Wu, 2008). In this section, an empirical study is
presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method for
causal analysis. Phase 1 is data preparation. This study adopts the
Computer Hardware Data Set selected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. As shown in Table 1, this dataset has 209 instances
regarding relative CPU performance between vendors. This study
sets out to model the relationships between six independent attributes (MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMIN, and CHMAX) and the
dependent attribute (PRP).
In phase 2, the Bayesian network classiﬁer with the TAN search
algorithm was implemented with WEKA, using a test mode of 10fold cross-validation. As a result, the causal relationship diagram
(Fig. 2) can be obtained. In Fig. 2, it is apparent that MYCT (machine
cycle time in nanoseconds) is the most important factor, because it
plays a core role, and one that further affects MMIN (minimum
main memory in kilobytes) and CHMIN (minimum channels in
units). However, the MYCT does not directly affect MMAX (maximum main memory in kilobytes), CACH (cache memory in kilobytes), and CHMAX (maximum channels in units).
In phase 3, referring to the causal relationship diagram (Fig. 2),

becomes quite easy. Therefore, after setting up the causal directions, implementation of PLS path modeling can be promptly performed. As a result, Fig. 3 is produced to display the relations
between attributes. Because each of the independent attributes
and the dependent attribute is measured by one item, both the
CR (Composite Reliability) value and the AVE (Average Variance
Extracted) value for each attribute is acceptable. Table 2 shows
path coefﬁcients between attributes. Except for ‘CACH ? PRP’,
‘CHMAX ? PRP’, and ‘CHMIN ? PRP’, all path coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant. In particular, the highest path coefﬁcient is the
‘‘MMAX ? MMIN” of 0.758. As for the R2 value, the PRP exhibits
the best ability to explain (91.1%) in this model. On the whole,
the combination of MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMIN, and
CHMAX has predictive ability for 91.1% of the PRP. If non-signiﬁcant path coefﬁcients are removed, then Fig. 4 exhibits relations
between attributes more clearly and, in this way, the MYCT is
depicted outstandingly. Finally, synthesizing and application of
the above analysis results is required in order to achieve better
decision-making.

constructs tends to become so complicated so we are compelled
to guess at enormous numbers of possibilities for causal directions.
In an effort to solve this difﬁculty, this paper proposes an effective
method of pursuing a causal analysis process, i.e. the author suggests implementing the Bayesian network prior to conducting
PLS path modeling. Additionally, an empirical study is presented
to demonstrate the successful application of the proposed method.
The proposed method embodies a successful combination of the
Bayesian network with the TAN search algorithm and PLS path
modeling for causal analysis. Although this methodology is successful in that the task of deciding the causal directions between
attributes becomes easy through use of the proposed method, this
study has some limitations. For instance, although the proposed
method can save us from countless instances of trial and error in
deciding causal directions, it is not necessarily the best solution
when using the TAN search algorithm to settle on the causal directions. This is a signiﬁcant issue calling for further future research.

Profoundly reasoned decision-making relies greatly on the ability of decision-makers to model complex cause–effect relationships, and thus to undertake constructive actions based on
dependable causal knowledge. Causal knowledge based on causal
analysis can improve the quality of decision-making and facilitate
the transformation and conversion of strategic objectives into
effective actions. Several studies have suggested various causal
analysis techniques to achieve causal knowledge. Among causal
analysis techniques, PLS path modeling is one of the most powerful
and popular causal analysis techniques.
However, few studies have concerned themselves with the
issue of theory dependency in implementing PLS path modeling.
When using PLS path modeling in a situation lacking the support
of an underlying previous theory, serious problems may arise. This
is because the task of deciding the causal direction between
