Entrepreneurs involved in planning or starting firms must engage in a
continuing process of appraising prospects for success. These assessments
presumably bear upon the preparations they make, as well as, at some
later point, whether they decide to make major changes or even to discontinue the business. In this study, data from 2994 entrepreneurs who
had recently become business owners were analyzed to determine their
perceived changes of success.
Although previous evidence on business survival led to the hypothesis that the entrepreneurs
would only be cautiously optimistic, this was not the case. They perceived their prospects as very
favorable, with 81% seeing odds of 7 out of IO or better and a remarkable 33% seeing odds of success
of 10 out of 10. In considering the prospects for other businesses like their own, they perceived odds
which were significantly lower, but still moderately favorable.
Based upon previous research on factors associated with new business success, it was hypothesized that those who were “more likely to succeed’ (based upon their personal backgrounds and the
nature of their new firms) would be more optimistic. However, this was not the case. Those who were
poorly prepared were just as optimistic as those who were well prepared.
At this point, shortly after having become business owners, the assessment by entrepreneurs of their
own likelihood of success was dramatically detachedfrom past macro statistics, from perceivedprospects
for peer businesses, andfrom characteristics typically associated with higher pedorming new$rms.
The psychological literature on “post-decisional bolstering” suggests that decision makers, in
many settings, tend to bolster or exaggerate the attractiveness of an option after it has been chosen.
This, coupled with the tendency of entrepreneurs to believe that they can control their own destinies,
implies that the extreme optimism observed here is probably a typical occurrence.

For entrepreneurs the findings suggest that it is probably natural to experience feelings of
entrepreneurial euphoria when first becoming a business owner. With the available evidence, it is
d@cult to judge whether this leads to inadequate preparations or an inability to diagnose problems
and make adjustments after the business is started. This extreme optimism probably does contribute
to the heavy personal commitments observed here, in which the median entrepreneur devoted more
than 60 hours per week to the business. The entrepreneur would seem weli advised to form relationships
with outsiders. such as board members and professional advisors, who can be objective and detached
in diagnosing problems and assessing objectively the prospects for the business in its current form.

INTRODUCTION
When an entrepreneur starts or buys a business, many would perceive this to be a risky
undertaking. The entrepreneur appears to have much at stake---capital, long hours invested,
reputation, and foregone opportunities. Yet, despite the combination of having much to lose
and the apparent poor chances for success, more than 50,000 new corporations are established
every month. In addition, many other entrepreneurs start unincorporated businesses or purchase existing firms.
This paper examines how entrepreneurs perceive their chances for success shortly after
they have become business owners. Do they see themselves as undertaking risky ventures,
with marginal prospects, or are they confident that, come what may, they will succeed?
What do they perceive as the chances for success for other businesses like theirs? Does
degree of optimism relate (in a rational manner) to the nature of their businesses or to factors
which previous research suggests might be associated with success?
Consideration of these questions should allow us to assess the degree of objectivity
exercised by entrepreneurs in rating their own potential for success. To the degree that
entrepreneurs grossly misjudge their prospects or have evaluations totally unrelated to success
factors demonstrated in prior research, they may operate under suboptimal biases. If there
is overoptimism,
entrepreneurs
may underestimate
the difficulties associated with their
businesses, thus failing to make the necessary preparations, e.g., larger capital bases, income from other sources, lines of credit, or adequate marketing expenditures. They may
further find it difficult to recognize problem areas, to make major changes, or to appraise
objectively whether to continue to make commitments.
If entrepreneurs are unduly pessimistic, then short-term problems may dominate their perspectives and reduce inclinations to stay with their firms through the start-up difficulties. Hence, by examining how
entrepreneurs perceive their prospects, we should increase our understanding of entrepreneurial thinking and of the processes leading to the formation and development of new
firms. This should alert both entrepreneurs and those who work with them to biases which
may develop. It may enable them to bring more objective thinking to bear about whether
their preparation and early progress are likely to lead to success or whether major changes
are necessary.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND HYPOTHESES
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic previous examination of how
entrepreneurs perceive their chances for success.
However, there has been research on factors that we might expect to influence these
perceptions. This would include research on the historic survival experience and success of
new firms. Presumably, if the actual success rate for new firms is low or high, entrepreneurs

<-----Page 2----->ENTREPRENEURS’

PERCEIVED CHANCES FOR SUCCESS

99

might sense this and adjust their assessments for their own businesses accordingly. There
has also been research examining relationships between characteristics of entrepreneurs and
the later performance of their firms. These relationships, if recognized, might lead entrepreneurs to take into account their own preparation and characteristics in judging whether
prospects for their firms are favorable or unfavorable.
Past studies of business survival suggest poor prospects for long-term survival for most
new businesses. (Some specialized groups, such as high-technology
firms, appear to have
much higher likelihood of success.) Shaper0 and Giglierano in 1982 reported on 13 previous
studies of discontinuance rates for new firms or the population of existing firms. One of the
largest was a U.S. Department of Commerce study of all operating businesses started or
transferred to new ownership during the eight years ending in 1954 (Churchill 1955). It
reported 46% discontinuing or changing hands within 1.5 years and 71% within 4.5 years.
The most frequently quoted study is that by Dun and Bradstreet, which reported that 67%
of new businesses discontinue within four years (Dun and Bradstreet 1967). A number of
focused studies, examining firms in specific industries and locations, have found discontinuance rates for nontechnical firms ranging from 50% after two years to 35% after three years
(Shaper0 and Giglierano 1982). However, Shaper0 and Giglierano, tracking firms through
telephone company Yellow Pages, found somewhat lower discontinuance rates-34%
after
two years and 50% after five years.
Variations in findings appear to reflect two factors. One is the sample of firms examined,
whether it is a cross section of all firms or a less diverse group such as manufacturing or
high-technology firms. Of particular importance is whether the sample is of new firms or a
cross section of established, more seasoned companies. A second point of difference relates
to the definition of “discontinued.” Many firms are sold, moved, or changed (merged, name
changed, etc.). These changes complicate the question of determining whether “a business”
has survived.
Even while recognizing these problems of sample selection and measurement, it appears
that 34%-50% of businesses discontinue or change hands after two years, with 50%-71%
meeting similar fates after five years. These numerous studies suggest that, at best, less than
50% of businesses survive for more than five years with a given owner/manager. In the light
of such historic experience, we might expect entrepreneurs who think objectively and rationally about their prospects to be cautiously optimistic and to assign at best an average
probability of 0.5 when evaluating their potential for success. This leads to our first
hypothesis.
Hypothesis
0.5.

The entrepreneurs’

perceived odds of success will be less than or equal to

A corollary of the above hypothesis is the expectation that entrepreneurs would perceive
their own odds to be about the same as those who are in similar businesses. While some
firms are better prepared and others less so, on average, the entrepreneurs should have the
same prospects as those in similar businesses. If their perceptions of odds for success are
based primarily on objective considerations, then entrepreneurs’ odds of success should not
deviate significantly from those assigned to their peer groups. Thus, the second hypothesis
states:
Hypothesis 2 The entrepreneurs’ perceived odds of success for their own businesses
not differ significantly from the odds assigned to businesses similar to their own.

Research on the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics and new business
success has been spotty, with relatively few studies that build upon each other. Probably
most relevant have been several longitudinal studies following firms through time, which
identified factors associated with survival and success.
A number of longitudinal
studies of manufacturing
and high-technology
start-ups
suggest that teams tend to be more successful than single founders (Hoad and Rosko 1964;
Roberts 1972; Cooper and Bruno 1977). Multiple founders usually have a broader base of
skills and experience and are also able to give one another psychological support. In regard
to education and industry experience, a study of 95 new manufacturing firms found that the
combination of education (one or more years in college) and prior industry experience was
associated with the greatest success. Education or experience alone was better than the
combination of inexperience and little education. Surprisingly, researchers found that the
entrepreneur’s prior experience might be in managerial or nonmanagerial
work with equal
benefit to the firm. However, a variety of experience seemed to correlate with greater success
(Hoad and Rosko 1964). A study of the founders of 8 1 Rhode Island retail and service
establishments revealed similar findings about the role of education, but contrasting findings
about experience. For these entrepreneurs, less than 10% of whom had completed college,
greater education was associated with success. Yet, those who had previously worked in
the same industry were not more successful. Prior experience as an owner, however, led to
a higher success rate (Mayer and Goldstein 1961). A broad cross-sectional study of 1805
business owners found that those with at least some college as well as those with supervisory
experience had achieved more growth than their counterparts with less education or experience (Dunkelberg and Cooper 1982).
For high-technology
firms, founders who had previously worked in an organization
utilizing similar technology and serving similar markets tended to be more successful (Roberts
1972; Cooper and Bruno 1977). In a broad cross section of firms, greater growth was
achieved by those that offered the same products or services as in their previous organizations
(Dunkelberg and Cooper, 1982). Interestingly, entrepreneurs who had spun off from larger
organizations (more than 500 employees) also did better (Cooper and Bruno 1977).
Success also seems to be related to the amount of initial capital; firms that have more
initial capital tend to be more successful (Mayer and Goldstein 1961; Lamont 1972; Roberts
1972). Presumably, the greater capital gives the new firm a longer period in which to work
out its problems and survive. The ability to raise a large amount of initial capital may also
reflect a more impressive strategy and management team.
The overall pattern of relationships is consistent with conventional wisdom. Despite
some mixed findings, success generally attended those entrepreneurs who were involved in
a founding team, who had education and relevant experience, who had owned previous
businesses, who started businesses similar to those they had left, who came from large firms,
and who had more initial capital. These findings suggest that entrepreneurs who have these
characteristics would be better prepared, more likely to succeed, and possibly more optimistic. In view of the above, we hypothesize that:

in the spring of 1985 to members of The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB)
who reported that they had recently become owners of businesses.’
A total of 2994 entrepreneurs (Table 2) who had become owners (primarily through
start-up or purchase) in 1984 and 1985 were selected from an initial sample of 4814 businesses. With this sample, the median entrepreneur had been in business for 12 months. The
interquartile range was 8-15 months. All of the businesses in the sample were underway
and had experienced some feedback from the marketplace. However, the firms had not really
been tested over time and some may have been surviving on their initial capital. Of course,
perceptions of chances for success may change over time and with experience. With this in
mind, we shall later examine whether entrepreneurs’ perceived odds of success vary with
months in business.
The sample is described more fully in Table 2. It seems broadly representative of
small business in the United States, with entrepreneurs from virtually all industries and parts
of the country. As noted, about 64% of these entrepreneurs became owners through starting
their firms and about 30% through purchase.
‘The NFlB has over half a million member firms. Based upon census and other government data, the
membership is reasonably representative of the population of small business in terms of industry, legal forms of
organization, and employment. Average NFIB employment does tend to be somewhat larger.

All entrepreneurs (n = 2994) became owners in 1984 or 1985. Data were gathered in May 1985
“Number of full-time + 0.5 x number of part-time employees.

It should be noted that this sample of entrepreneurs had substantial stakes in their
ventures. For the sample, 67% invested $lO,OOO or more and 51% invested $2O,OOO or
more. Their investment of time was particularly noteworthy. The median entrepreneur reported devoting 60 hours or more per week to the venture and 75% reported a work week
of 50 hours or more. It is clear from these profiles of commitment that these entrepreneurs
had major stakes in their ventures. These were not investments “on the side,” like lottery
tickets, which, if lost, could be easily absorbed. Thus, there were incentives for the entrepreneurs to assess with care their chances for success.
Against this backdrop of heavy commitments,
the entrepreneurs were asked, “What
are the odds of your business succeeding ?” They were given 11 choices, ranging from 0
chances in 10 to 10 in 10. Similarly, they were asked, “What are the odds of any business
like yours succeeding?’ These two measures labeled O&yours and Oddlike, as well as other
variables measuring the success factors listed in Table 1, were used to test the hypotheses.

RESULTS
The results for the entrepreneurs’
perceptions of their own odds for success display a
noteworthy degree of optimism. As shown in Table 3, 95% perceived odds of success of 5
out of 10 or better, and 81% odds of 7 out of 10 or better. A remarkable 33% perceived
their chances as “dead certain,” 10 out of 10. The mean value was 8.1. This is substantially
and significantly more than the hypothesized value of 5.0 or less (a = 0.000). We reject
the first hypothesis that entrepreneurs would perceive their own odds to be less than or equal
to 5.0 out of 10.0.
The results when entrepreneurs were asked, “What are the odds of any business like
yours succeeding?” are shown in Table 4. Of the entrepreneurs, 78% perceived these odds
as 5 out of 10 or better and 39% perceived odds of 7 out of 10 or better. The mean value
of 5.9 is substantially and significantly less than the value of 8.1 which the entrepreneurs
saw as their own odds for success (CX= 0.000). We reject the second hypothesis that
entrepreneurs would perceive their own odds as not significantly different from those assigned
to similar businesses.

A comparison
of their own prospects for success with those for others in the same
kind of business is revealing (see Table 5). Only 5% perceived their own chances as poorer
than for others in the same business. About 27% saw their chances as exactly the same as
others, and 68% perceived their odds for success as better than others. The cross-tabulations
are shown in Table 6.
We now consider whether entrepreneurs’ perceptions of their own prospects are relelated to objective predictors of success. As noted earlier, previous research has identified
a number of factors related to the background of the entrepreneur or the nature of the new
business which seem associated with success.
Two dependent variables were available for analysis: first, the entrepreneur’s probabilistic assessment of success on a scale of 0 to 10 (Oddyours). The second measure compares
perceived chances of success for the entrepreneur’s own firm to those of similar businesses.
This measure is constructed by forming a simple difference between the firm’s own odds
of success and the odds for similar firms (Difodd). Thus, an objective assessment of 7 (out

of 10) might be optimistic or pessimistic
depending
on whether the entrepreneur feels that
the odds of success for others is 7 in 10 (a difference of 0) or only 3 in 10 (a difference of
4). Essentially, this is a measure of whether the entrepreneur perceives his or her chances
for success to be substantially better or poorer than those for similar firms.
Regression analyses were performed, using the “objective predictors” as independent
variables and using each of the measures of expected success discussed above as dependent
variables. Results are shown in Table 7.
The first analysis, that involving only the entrepreneurs’ probabilistic assessments of
success (Oddyours), produced disappointing results. It explained little of the variation in
odds, with a R2 of only 0.01.
The second analysis used the dependent variable derived from the difference between
the entrepreneur’s perceived chances of success and the perceived chances of success for
similar businesses (Difodd). The resulting analysis, shown in Table 7, again exhibited a
lack of systematic relationships between objective predictors and this measure of optimism.
Despite the large sample size, most variables were not significant and the R2 was only 0.02.
Those who were poorly prepared seemed just as optimistic as those who were well prepared.
It is clear that we must reject the hypothesis that perceived odds of success are related to
the “objective predictors” of success listed in Table 1.
Since the sample firms had been in business for varying amounts of time, we examined
whether degree of optimism was related to months in business. One might have expected
that entrepreneurs with older, more “seasoned” businesses would be more optimistic. Pre-

<-----Page 9----->106

sumably, their firms had demonstrated the ability to survive over time. However, examination
of odds for success by months in business showed no significant differences. Those who
had just started their firms were just as optimistic as those who had been in business 16
months or more.

DISCUSSION
In this, the first systematic examination
success, several findings seem clear:

of how entrepreneurs

perceive

their chances

for

1. Entrepreneurs who have already made the commitment to become business owners display
a remarkable degree of optimism. Most see their own odds for success as extremely
high, far higher than would seem justified by the historic experience of new firms.
2. Entrepreneurs perceive their prospects for success as substantially better than those for
similar businesses.
3. Entrepreneurs’ perceptions of their own chances for success do not seem to be systematically related to factors which previous research suggests might be associated with
success.
Clearly, the assessment by entrepreneurs of their own likelihood of success is dramatically detached from past macro statistics, perceived likelihood of the peer group, and
characteristics typically associated with higher-performing
new businesses. The proposed
model, one based on rational, objective evaluation of relevant factors totally fails to account
for the perceptions of new business owners. To understand the observed extreme bias toward
optimism, we turn to an alternative perspective outside of the rational framework for possible
explanations. The psychological literature on post-decisional bolstering and on the psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs offers insights.
The theory of cognitive dissonance leads to the expectation that decision makers will
bolster or exaggerate the attractiveness of an option after it has been chosen (Abelson and
Levi 1985, p. 276). In field experiments conducted in real-life settings, a high degree of
post-decisional bolstering has been observed as people made choices regarding jobs, candidates in a political campaign, or betting in a horse race. Thus, entrepreneurs who have
already made the decision to start a business may express optimism as an example of “activity
(that) involves developing new defensive attitudes and rationalizations
that enable the decision maker to recommit himself” (Janis and Mann 1977, p. 317). These considerations
would account for the high degree of optimism among entrepreneurs who have made substantial commitments.
The psychological makeup of entrepreneurs may also have played a role. There has
been research on entrepreneurs’ propensity to take risks. (External observers might perceive
entrepreneurs to be undertaking ventures in which the probability of success seems low and
might thereby conclude that entrepreneurs have a high propensity to take risks.) McClelland
noted that in a variety of laboratory tests individuals who perform well in an entrepreneurial
role have demonstrated a preference for tasks in which the risks are moderate and their
efforts or skills can make a difference (McClelland
1961). Furthermore, Brockhaus, reviewing the literature on entrepreneurial risk-taking, found that most of the empirical evidence
suggested that entrepreneurs are only moderate risk-takers (Brockhaus 1982). Entrepreneurs
have also often been found to have high levels of internal locus-of-control beliefs, meaning
that they believe they can control their own destinies. Brockhaus has commented on this
characteristic as it relates to entrepreneurial expectations, “Entrepreneurs have such a high

belief in their ability to influence the achievement of business goals that the perceived
possibility of failure is relatively low” (Brockhaus 1986, p. 29). The findings presented here
are clearly consistent with the previous research on these entrepreneurial characteristics.
It may seem particularly surprising that those who were well prepared and those who
were poorly prepared seemed equally optimistic. It may be that entrepreneurs,
at least at
this stage of their commitment,
are unable to assess objectively their own strengths and
weaknesses and the early progress of their firms. If so, this would raise serious questions
about their ability to diagnose problems, make adjustments, and make objective assessments
about whether to continue their heavy personal commitments. It may also be that the psychological process of postdecisional bolstering has an overwhelming effect as entrepreneurs
make these assessments. All entrepreneurs, whether well prepared or not, may experience
“entrepreneurial euphoria,” in which they feel they must succeed and then assess their odds
accordingly.
What are the implications of these findings? For scholars, they add to our understanding
of the processes leading to the formation and development of new firms. Furthermore, the
findings seem consistent with earlier research on “risk-taking propensity” and “locus-ofcontrol” characteristics of entrepreneurs. We should further note that the sample considered
here is a broad cross section of small businesses, with many of the retail and service firms
noted for high rates of discontinuance.
These optimistic entrepreneurs were not concentrated
in the segments of the economy noted for long business lives.
For entrepreneurs the findings suggest that it is probably natural to experience feelings
of entrepreneurial euphoria when first becoming a business owner. With the available evidence, it is difficult to judge whether this leads to making inadequate preparations or overlooking potential problems. We can note that the median firm started with an investment of
slightly more than $2O,OOO. While this is not a trivial investment, it probably provides little
cushion for unexpected problems which might arise. This may mean that the overwhelming
optimism observed here is often associated with thin capitalization and thus an inability to
survive unexpected problems. Extreme optimism may also make it difficult for the entrepreneur to diagnose problem areas, to redirect the venture, or possibly to close it down.
Given the psychological processes at work, the entrepreneur would seem well advised to
form relationships with outsiders who can provide objective assessments. Board members,
other business people, accountants, and attorneys can, if kept informed, provide not only
expertise, but also objective assistance in diagnosing problems and appraising prospects.
However, there may also be benefits associated with extreme optimism. It may thereby
become easier to make the great time commitments observed here. (Recall that the median
entrepreneur was devoting more than 60 hours per week to the business.) Thus, buoyed by
optimism he or she may work to make the entrepreneurial decision turn out right and, in
doing so, may actually increase prospects for success. In addition, optimism may help the
entrepreneur to avoid discouragement
and to find ways to overcome the many problems
which often arise.
For those who work with entrepreneurs,
the high, possibly unrealistic degrees of
optimism observed here may be what will usually be observed. It may not be desirable to
try to dampen this optimism, but the external advisor is in a position to provide objective
and detached advice. Working closely with the entrepreneur, it may be possible to make
real contributions in diagnosing strengths and weaknesses and in helping the entrepreneur
to assess objectively prospects for the business in its current form. The entrepreneurial
euphoria observed here may make it difficult for the entrepreneur to make these judgments
when working alone.

This is the first stage of a longitudinal
study, in which the sample firms and their
performance will be tracked for two successive years. It should then be possible to relate
subsequent performance to the entrepreneurs’ original projections of prospects for success
as well as to variables normally thought to be related to entrepreneurial
success.
