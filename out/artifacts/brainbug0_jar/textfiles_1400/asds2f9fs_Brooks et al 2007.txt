Abstract
In this paper we utilise data from the Australian version of the TV game show, "Deal or No
Deal", to explore risk aversion in a high real stakes setting. An attractive feature of this
version of the game is that supplementary rounds may occur which switch the decision frame
of players. There are four main findings. First, we observe that the degree of risk aversion
generally increases with stakes. Second, we observe considerable heterogeneity in people's
willingness to bear risk – even at very high stakes. Third, we find that age and gender are
statistically significant determinants of risk aversion, while wealth is not. Fourth, we find that
the reversal of framing does have a significant impact on people's willingness to bear risk.

<-----Page 2----->1. Introduction
The analysis of decisions under uncertainty is fundamental to modern economics and finance.
This paper contributes to a recently developing empirical literature that adopts the central
research question: How risk averse are individuals? Subsidiary questions regarding risk
aversion that we address include its heterogeneity and how it varies with individual
demographic characteristics (especially age, wealth and gender). While the theoretical
literature on risk aversion and expected utility theory is large and long-standing, the literature
explicitly testing for risk aversion is comparatively small. Such empirical tests as exist, either
in laboratory or field experiments involving real stakes, have mostly been confined to small
cash values. There has been a recent debate doubting the applicability of such estimates when
extrapolated to high real stakes (see Rabin, 2000 and Segal, 2005). Our paper exploits an
Australian game show dataset to explore the nature of risk aversion of contestants who face
an environment of very high stakes.
"Deal or No Deal" is a half-hour TV game show in which contestants make a series of
choices between a sure thing and a lottery.1 It is ideal for studying a range of issues relating to
economic decision making. The show consists of a chosen contestant faced with 26 suitcases,
randomly containing amounts ranging from 50 cents to $200,000 dollars. There are up to nine
"normal" rounds in the main stage of the game. Unlike other versions of the show, the
Australian version of “Deal or No Deal” also involves the potential for one of two extra
rounds - the Chance round and the SuperCase round.
First, when only two suitcases are left, the contestant may be offered a "Chance"
round, allowing them to exchange the certain amount that they've already won for a fifty-fifty
lottery between the two remaining prizes. Second, when all suitcases have been revealed, the
1

We use data from the Australian version of Deal or No Deal, although the show has now been syndicated in
over 30 countries. It should be emphasized that the show, although franchised from the same Dutch source (the
Endemol TV entertainment company) is not identical across all its franchises. Variations in the game show
introduced by different countries leads to different datasets. Confining our attention to a single version of Deal
or No Deal has the advantage of giving us a uniform experimental setting.

<-----Page 3----->2
contestant may be given the option of swapping the certain amount that they have won for the
"SuperCase", which is a lottery in which one of eight prizes may be won. Both these
possibilities are entirely at the discretion of the producers. These special rounds involve a
reversal of the contestants' frame of reference and, hence, are ideal for testing framing effects.
Accordingly, we exploit this feature of our dataset.
Our paper investigates two fundamental issues. First, we explore the willingness of
contestants to take risks with large monetary gambles. Second, we assess whether contestant
decision-making reflects framing effects. Regarding the first issue, we find that, while on
average most contestants on “Deal or No Deal” are probably risk averse, their willingness to
bear risk is greater than had previously been found in studies of US game shows. Moreover,
many contestants are willing to take very risky gambles, even when the stakes are high. There
is a high degree of heterogeneity among contestants. Our results also re-affirm the prior
literature that people become more risk averse as stakes rise (Holt and Laury, 2002).
The theoretical and scientific attraction of expected utility theory is that it posits a
consistent preference relation regardless of changes in the ‘frame’ of the decision, especially
with respect to changes in a decision-maker's wealth. Prospect theory (which implies loss
aversion2) is a well-known example of a theory of decision-making under uncertainty where
that is not the case. The Australian version of the “Deal or No Deal” game show is well-suited
to test framing effects because some contestants face a reversal of the framing of their choice
when they participate in either the Chance round or the SuperCase round described above. In
the "normal" rounds, contestants face the prospect of swapping their rights to the lottery for a
sure amount of money. In contrast, in the Chance and SuperCase rounds, contestants face the

‘Loss aversion’ describes how a person's welfare will fall more as a result of losing a specified amount of
money than it rises when they win the same amount of money. People who are loss averse will be willing to take
large risks to avoid losses but will tend to be risk averse with potential gains. See, for example, Kahnemann and
Tverskey (1979).

<-----Page 4----->3
prospect of exchanging a certain amount of money already won (via the "Deal" agreed to
earlier) for a gamble.
Approximately 40 percent of the contestants in our dataset participate in one of these
"special" rounds. We find that contestants exhibit a considerably higher level of risk aversion
in both the Chance and SuperCase rounds than in the normal rounds. Assuming the validity of
an underlying assumption that contestants are characterisable by some type of non-expected
utility model, this appears to provide some support for a kind of preference reversal or
framing effect. Notably, other game show studies in the literature, as well as versions of the
“Deal or No Deal” game show exhibited in other countries, do not involve such a reversal of
the choice framework, and so were not able to test this behavioural effect.
On the important issue of the variation in risk aversion with agent characteristics, we
find, consistent with much of the pre-existing literature, that attributes like age and gender
have a statistically significant effect. While the evidence to date on this issue is mixed, where
studies have found an impact, it is almost always that women are more risk averse than men.
Our findings are consistent with Hartog et al. (2000) using survey data from the Netherlands,
with Holt and Laury (2002), using experimental data, and with Cohen and Einav (2005), who
utilize a large car insurance dataset to structurally estimate risk aversion and attributes long
thought to influence risk aversion. A similar gender effect has also been found in several
studies in the finance literature (see, for example, Cohn et al., 1975; Lewellen et al., 1978).
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The next section briefly outlines
the relevant literature. Section 3 outlines the “Deal or No Deal” game show and describes the
data it generates. Section 4 presents and discusses our empirical results, and Section 5
concludes.

<-----Page 5----->4
2. Relevant Literature
Researchers have, to date, largely relied upon three methods to study the magnitude and
variability (with stakes) of risk aversion. First, they have run experiments in which people
face actual monetary gambles.3 Given the funding limits of such studies, many (though not
all) were perforce small-stakes. The second method is to rely upon responses to surveys (see
the discussion at the beginning of Camerer, 1995). This permits the consideration of people's
attitudes to gambles involving much larger sums – but such studies are limited to hypothetical
choices and there is no reason for thinking that what people say they will do when faced with
high stakes, is what they in fact will do (see Holt and Laury, 2002, and the discussion in
Hartog et. al., 2000). Finally, there is the use of `field experiments,' or situations of datageneration outside the direct control of the researcher in which people are faced with large
gambles. This includes a game show literature as well as a small literature utilizing
experiments conducted in developing countries. Collectively, these studies have found that
people are generally (though only moderately) risk averse in high stakes environments, and
that they become more risk averse as the stakes of the gamble increase (though, again, only
mildly).
Most of the game show papers are limited in their direct comparability to our paper
because they involve strategic interaction rather than, as is the case with “Deal or No Deal”,
pure decision theoretic considerations. Papers concerning strategic game shows focus on the
disjunction and possible means of reconciliation between actual play and the theoretically
prescribed optimal play, an issue since resolved in laboratory experiments via the use of
quantal response equilibrium models (see McKelvey and Palfrey, 1995).4 A game show
paper that focuses explicitly on measuring risk aversion is Gertner (1993). He utilizes data
3

See for example the survey of the laboratory auction literature by Bajari and Hortascu (2005), and also Holt
and Laury (2002), Harrison et. al. (2003) and Goeree et. al.(2000).

Three papers consider the show `The Price is Right': Bennett and Hickman (1993), Berk, Hughson and
Vandezande (1996) and Healy and Noussair (1995). A paper by Metrick (1995) examines data from the game
show `Jeopardy.' None of them explicitly test for risk aversion.

<-----Page 6----->5
from the show ‘Card Sharks’. Gertner finds a very high coefficient of risk aversion. Further,
Gertner finds that individual player-behavior is inconsistent with expected utility theory.
Fullenkamp, Tenorio and Battalio (2003) consider lottery games and find risk aversion
displayed and also that it varies with the size of the stakes. Hersch and McDougall (1997)
consider the same type of data for lottery games and find that income is not a significant
determinant, a finding replicated in the current paper. Beetsma and Schotman (2001) consider
the show `Lingo' and find evidence of risk aversion.
An advantage of the current paper compared to other game show papers is that “Deal
or No Deal” requires no special skills in order to succeed. This has been recognised as an
important characteristic by researchers – so much so, that a rapidly expanding literature using
“Deal of No Deal” data has emerged contemporaneous with our work. Such studies are well
represented by: Bombardini and Trebbi (2005); Blavatskyy and Progrebna (2006a and
2006b); Post et al. (2006); de Roos and Serafidis (2006) and Andersen et al. (2006a, b and c).
Bombardini and Trebbi (2005), analyse the Italian version of the “Deal or No Deal”
global franchise and structurally estimate a sample average constant risk aversion parameter
of about unity. Contrary to our work, they find no evidence for the dependence of risk
aversion on agent characteristics like age and gender. In a finding relevant to our paper, they
are unable to rule out that their dataset was generated via contestants possessing non-expected
utility preferences. Two further papers utilising the Italian version of the show are Blavatskyy
and Progrebna (2006a and 2006b). The main focus of the first of these is in confirming that
contestant risk aversion is invariant under differing likelihoods of identical gains. In the
second paper, the authors exploit a special suitcase-swapping feature of the Italian version of
the game show to directly test for (and refute) contestant loss aversion. Andersen et al. (2006a
and b) find evidence for probability weighting, but not for loss aversion. The paper by Post et
al. (2006) uses combined data from the German, Dutch and Belgium franchises and they find

<-----Page 7----->6
that, independent of nationality, player behaviour is both path-dependent and framedependent. Like us, de Roos and Serafidis (2006) employ Australian data. They obtain (in a
model which ignores the supplementary rounds) a structural estimate of risk aversion of one
half (assuming zero initial wealth). They too are unable to rule out the hypothesis that their
dataset was generated via contestants possessing non-expected utility preferences.

3. The Game Show
3.1 Description of the Show
The TV game “Deal or No Deal” is comprised of three stages. The first two involve the
selection of a player ("the contestant") chosen to play the game (they reduce the contestant
pool from 150 to one), and the third stage deals with the playing of the game proper.
In Stage 1, the 150 members of the studio audience are sorted into 6 groups of 25. One
of these groups is chosen at random. An additional, 26th person is chosen at random from the
remaining pool of 125. These 26 people progress to Stage 2. Stage 2 is a trivia contest based
on three simple questions.

Of the Stage 2 participants that answer the most questions

correctly, the chosen contestant is the person with the fastest reaction time. The contestant
then moves on to Stage 3, which is the segment of the game that is of interest for this paper.
Stage 3 constitutes the game proper, and is the part which generates the dataset used in
this paper. It starts with 26 numbered suitcases, each of which contains a concealed, predetermined monetary prize. The 26 unique money prizes range from 50 cents to a maximum
of $200,000, with most of the values falling below $10,000. The schedule of prizes is
contained in Appendix A. The schedule of prizes remains the same in each show, although the
amount allocated to each numbered suitcase is determined randomly before the start of each
show.

<-----Page 8----->7
At the start of Stage 3, the contestant chooses one suitcase, which is set aside. If the
contestant plays Stage 3 to its ultimate conclusion, the contestant will win the prize contained
in that suitcase. The remaining 25 suitcases are given to the 25 unsuccessful participants in
Stage 2 ("the suitcase contestants").
Next, in Round 1 of the game, the contestant chooses six suitcases, from the remaining
25, for removal. As the contestant nominates each suitcase for removal, the monetary prize
contained in that suitcase is revealed by the suitcase contestant holding it. Once a money prize
has been revealed, it is removed from the game and can no longer be won.
After the first six suitcases have been removed, the "Bank" (i.e. the producers of the
game show) makes an offer to the contestant via the host of the game show: the "Bank Offer".
The Bank Offer is a cash prize - determined, in part, by which money prizes remain available
to be won in the 20 remaining unopened suitcases. The contestant can either accept this offer
by choosing "Deal", or continue to the next round of Stage 3 by choosing "No Deal". When
making this and all future decisions, the contestant is fully aware of which prizes remain
available to be won.5
If "Deal" is chosen, the contestant wins the money offered by the Bank but forfeits the
right to continue playing Stage 3. If "No Deal" is chosen, then the contestant moves to Round
2 of the game and must nominate a further five suitcases for removal from the 19 unopened
cases still held by suitcase contestants.

The contestant may not nominate the suitcase

originally set aside. After the money prizes contained in these five suitcases are revealed, the
contestant receives a second, revised Bank Offer. If, after the second Bank Offer, the

5

One possible issue that could be raised concerning the mechanics of the bank's offer is whether it involves
some strategic or informative element, transforming the environment of the field experiment from a pure
decision-theoretic to a game theoretic one. We found that the correlation between, on the one hand, the ratio of
the bank offer to the expected value of the remaining suitcases, and, on the other, the ratio of the contestant's
initially chosen suitcase to the expected value of the remaining suitcases, was 0.08 - a value sufficiently low to
suggest that strategic behaviour is a non issue. Moreover, this correlation falls in the final two rounds and even
turns slightly negative in round nine. Thus, our operating assumption in this paper – that the contestants find
themselves in a pure decision-theoretic environment – is justified.

<-----Page 9----->8
contestant chooses "No Deal", a further four suitcases must be removed (Round 3). The Bank
then makes a third Bank Offer based on the remaining 11 suitcases.6
The contestant again chooses either "Deal" or "No Deal". If "No Deal" is chosen, the
contestant moves to a fourth Round and must nominate a further three suitcases for removal.
After their removal, the Bank makes a fourth offer, based on the remaining 8 unopened
suitcases. The contestant again chooses "Deal" or "No Deal". If "No Deal" is chosen, two
more suitcases must be removed in Round 5, after which a fifth Bank Offer is made. If "No
Deal" is chosen after the fifth offer, the game enters a phase (Rounds 6-9) in which suitcases
held by the suitcase contestants are removed one by one. After the removal of each suitcase, a
new Bank Offer is made.
When only one unopened suitcase held by a suitcase contestant remains, the contestant
must either accept the 9th Bank Offer or choose their own suitcase over the suitcase held by
the single remaining suitcase contestant.
If at any time during the game the contestant has accepted a Bank Offer, s/he will
continue to nominate suitcases for removal "as if" s/he were still playing Stage 3. This
heightens tension allowing TV viewers to imagine "what might have been." Finally, this
counter-factual exercise allows for the possibility (since this occurs at the discretion of the
producers) of one of the two supplementary rounds (the Chance and SuperCase rounds) to be
played. These rounds, unique to the Australian game show, are important for our test of
framing effects.

Appendix B contains a characterization of the rounds of play in the

Australian version of “Deal or No Deal”. Appendix C summarizes the play in 9 normal
rounds and a Chance round from an illustrative actual game from our dataset in which the
contestant wins $100,000.

That is, the suitcase originally chosen by the contestant and the 10 unopened cases still held by suitcase
contestants.

<-----Page 10----->9
3.2 Description of the Data
We have data for 102 episodes from the second and third series of the Australian version of
the “Deal or No Deal” game show. Table 1 displays descriptive statistics. The mean value of
prizes won in these episodes is $15,810 with a standard deviation of $18,541.7 The minimum
prize won was $1 and the maximum $105,000. Not surprisingly, the Bank Offers in the initial
rounds were generally low relative to the expected value of the remaining suitcases. Given
that there is only one contestant per show, the producers have a strong incentive to ensure that
each contestant plays at least a few rounds. In our sample, no contestants accepted an offer in
rounds 1, 2 or 3, and only one contestant accepted in the fourth round. A total of 91
contestants played until at least round 6.
However, these averages obscure interesting behavioural heterogeneity at the agent
level. Perhaps most notably, 49 Bank Offers that were greater than the expected value of the
remaining suitcases were rejected. Of these 49 rejected offers, 14 were greater than $8,000,
10 were for greater than $10,000 and 3 exceeded $20,000. The mean Bank Offer greater than
expected value that is rejected is $6,000. Out of a sample of 102, 8 different contestants
rejected at least one offer greater than an expected value of more than $10,000. As such, this
represents a sizeable minority of the sample who exhibit risk-loving behaviour with very large
stakes.
We have data on three personal characteristics of each contestant: gender; age; and the
postcode in which they reside.8 Forty eight percent of contestants in the sample were male.
The age of contestants varied from 18 to 66 years, with a mean of 32 and standard deviation
of 10. For each postcode, we obtained average income data from the 2001 Australian Census,
and used this as a proxy for individual wealth.

7

For comparative purposes it should be noted that the 26 suitcases that are available to be won at the beginning
of each game have a mean of $19,112 and standard deviation of $44,576.
8
Postcodes in Australia are analogous to Zip Codes in the U.S.

<-----Page 11----->10
3.3 Strengths and Limitations of the Data
Strengths
Two important advantages of our data are that they describe decisions with both high stakes
and real financial consequences. Notably, Holt and Laury (2002) find evidence that people's
risk aversion is different when there are real stakes as opposed to hypothetical choices.
Further, several studies (Binswanger, 1980, Kachelmeier, 1982 and Holt and Laury, 2002)
find that risk aversion increases along with the stakes of a gamble. It is important to stress
that the stakes in “Deal or No Deal” are higher than any feasible experiment and almost any
other game shows. The mean prize won by contestants is almost $16,000 with the highest
prize being $105,000.9
“Deal or No Deal” also offers contestants very simple, stark choices. Almost all other
game shows that have been studied by economists involve some element of skill, whether it
be knowledge of trivia, skill in word games or an ability to compute the odds in a game of
chance involving cards. The only skill needed in “Deal or No Deal” is the comparison of a
gamble with a certain offer: precisely the computational capacity in which economists are
interested when studying decision making under uncertainty.
Finally, the format of the Australian version of “Deal or No Deal” (or, more precisely,
the existence of the Chance and SuperCase rounds), is ideal for testing framing effects as
many contestants face a change of framing in the final round of the game. This feature is not
present in other game shows based on lottery choices, and is also not present in other
franchises of the “Deal or No Deal” paradigm shown in other countries.

9

Put another way, to perform this experiment from scratch would have required a total prize pool of
approximately $1.6 million.

<-----Page 12----->11
Limitations
The possibility of selection bias in the contestant pool is an issue for this paper, as it is for all
studies based upon game show data. The process of selecting the contestant in Stages 1 and 2
is likely to mitigate this problem.
As just explained above, there are two stages in the selection of the contestant. First,
26 people are randomly chosen from the audience. It is not clear that the people who
volunteer for quiz show audiences are systematically more risk averse or more risk seeking
than the broader population. Arguments might plausibly be made that, for example, they may
be more extroverted, on average, than the general population, or that they may have more free
time on average. But even if these conjectures are true, there can be no a priori supposition
that these qualities are correlated with risk aversion, and certainly there is nothing in the
existing literature to suggest that they are.
In the second stage, the 26 people randomly chosen from the audience compete to
become the contestant by participating in a very simple trivia quiz in which the emphasis is on
speed. There is no reason to think that there is any correlation between reaction time in a
simple quiz and risk aversion.
The fact that the contestant is, in effect, randomly chosen from the audience via a twostage process means that it is simply not possible for the producers of the show to engage in
as much vetting of contestants as they would if contestants were chosen directly via an
application process.
The artificial environment of the game show could potentially increase or decrease
people's risk aversion. On the one hand, the excitement of being on television, surrounded by
lights and a screaming audience could make people more prone to risk taking or to errors of
judgement. On the other hand, some people may become more risk averse when in front of a
national audience and carefully avoid doing anything embarrassingly foolish. The possibility

<-----Page 13----->12
that these factors are roughly in balance, on average, is consistent with earlier studies of game
shows which have found that contestants display levels of risk aversion broadly in line with
participants in experimental studies.

4. Empirical Findings
4.1 Baseline Analysis ignoring Supplementary Rounds
To explore our main research questions, we conduct probit regression modelling of the
likelihood of accepting a bank offer against a number of factors related to the game and
observable agent heterogeneity. Factors which raise the likelihood of accepting bank offers
can be said to be covariates of risk aversion. Panel A of Table 2 shows both the chosen
regressors and the results for the full dataset comprising rounds 1-9 of such a probit
regression (where the dependent variable is whether or not a Bank Offer is accepted). It is
reported as model (1).
Previous studies have found that risk aversion increases with rising stakes (see
Binswanger, 1980; Kachelmeier and Shehata, 1992; and Holt and Laury, 2002). Our results
lend support to this. The higher is the Bank Offer relative to the expected value of the
remaining suitcases, the more likely a person is to accept. The marginal effect of this ratio is
0.35. We also found a mild scale effect. The higher is the offer, the more likely is a person to
accept. The marginal effect of a change in the offer of $10,000 is 0.04. With respect to
observable personal characteristics, only age was statistically significant.10 The model was
better at approximating the effects of age when a quadratic, rather than linear, form was used.
In unreported results, we also tested a model that included the standard deviation of the

10

In supplementary analysis, we experimented with all three proxies for income for which we had data:
household income, family income and personal income. The results for household income are shown. None of
these measures of income was statistically significant.

<-----Page 14----->13
remaining prizes and various measures of regret.11 Neither of these variables was statistically
significant.12
To check the robustness of our initial finding with respect to gender, we also included
it as an interaction dummy. The results are contained in Panel A of Table 2 as model (2). We
interact gender with the offer and with the ratio of the offer to the expected value of the
remaining suitcases. Males are more likely to have increasing risk aversion as the stakes of
the gamble rise. They are also less likely than females to accept an offer for a given ratio
between the offer and the expected value (i.e. to be less risk averse). The current consensus,
in what is a still-developing literature, appears to be that when gender has been found to have
a significant effect on the measurement of risk aversion (not all studies show an effect), the
effect has been that women are more risk averse than men. Our results fit comfortably into
this consensus.13
Panel B of Table 2 shows the hit-miss table for model (2) - i.e. the likelihood of model
(2) correctly predicting the decision for each observation when considering rounds 1-9. Of
the 728 offers made, 609 were rejected and 119 accepted. Our model correctly predicts 586
of the rejections (96%) and 49 of the acceptances (41%). This represents a 22% improvement
over a baseline model that predicts rejection in all rounds. Notably, an alternative benchmark
that separately predicts each round individually does no better than the benchmark used as
there is a greater than 50% chance of accepting in only rounds 8 and 9 and it is only slightly
higher than 50% in those rounds (51% and 52%, respectively).

11

To test regret, we included the ratio of the current Bank Offer to the immediately preceding Bank Offer and,
alternatively, the ratio of the current Bank Offer to the highest previous Bank Offer made to the contestant. We
also tested the difference between the current Bank Offer and the immediately preceding/highest previous Bank
Offer. None of these was statistically significant. Results are not reported to conserve space.
12
For each of the models tested in the paper, we also estimated results for a panel specification (fixed effects),
grouping each agent's sequence of decisions. Depending upon which variables we included and the subset of our
sample that we used (i.e. whether we included all rounds or just rounds 6-9), we found that the results either
reverted to the non-panel specification or that our estimates of the ratio of the variance of the individual effects
to the total variance were not statistically significant.
13
For a recent survey see Crossen and Gneezy (2004).

<-----Page 15----->14
Rounds 1-5 are relatively uninformative since the Bank Offers are typically set low
enough to ensure rejection. Given that there is only one contestant per show, it is necessary
for there to be at least 5 rounds to create a meaningful half hour TV program.

As a

consequence, almost all of the interesting choices occur in rounds 6-9. Accordingly, Table 3
shows the probit results and hit-miss table when the data for estimation is confined to rounds
6-9. Note that focusing solely on later rounds reduces concern about the assumption of
myopic decision-making made in this paper.
Focusing on rounds 6-9 reduces the sample size to 233. Both the ratio of the Bank
Offer to the expected value of the remaining suitcases and the size of the Bank Offer remain
statistically significant in model (1) and the ratio is significant in model (2). Age is only
statistically significant at the 10 percent level, which probably reflects the smaller sample
size. Gender and income remain statistically insignificant.
The results for model (2) in Panel A of Table 3 include interaction dummies with
gender for rounds 6-9. The interaction dummies remain statistically significant (although
only at the 10 percent level for the interaction with the ratio) and once again indicate that
males are more likely to become risk averse as the stakes increase but that males are also less
likely than females to be swayed by a positive bank offer-expected value ratio.
As shown in Panel B of Table 3, model (2) now correctly predicts 55% of
acceptances, although the prediction rate for rejections falls to 83%. Overall, the model
represents a 33% improvement over the baseline case in rounds 6-9.

<-----Page 16----->15
4.2 Extended Analysis incorporating Supplementary Rounds
One of the most serious challenges to expected utility theory is the potential for preference
reversals when the framing of a choice changes. Prospect theory is one example of a framing
effect in which individuals will behave differently, depending upon their ‘reference point’.
Prospect theory asserts that people will display an asymmetry in their attitude to risk
delineated by gains versus losses.

Specifically, prospect theory posits that people will

generally be risk averse in lottery choices involving gains and risk seeking in lottery choices
involving losses. In particular, prospect theory suggests a utility function that is (i) defined on
deviations from the reference point (not on overall wealth); (ii) is concave for gains and
convex for losses; and (iii) is steeper for losses than gains. This results in the well known Sshaped utility function of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1992).
It was mentioned in the section describing the rules of the game that, even once a
contestant has accepted a bank offer, the game does not technically end.

Rather, the

contestant is required to engage in the counter-factual exercise of continuing to remove
suitcases from the remaining suitcases until only two remain, at which time the possibility
(since this is entirely at the discretion of the producers) of playing a supplementary Chance or
SuperCase round arises.
In the chance situation, the Bank offers the contestant a chance to retract the "Deal"
they had accepted in an earlier round. If the contestant accepts the retraction, they swap all
winnings from that previously made deal for a lottery. Since the Chance round only ever
occurs in Round 9 when just two prize outcomes remain, the Chance round represents a
choice between a fifty-fifty gamble between two prizes versus the amount already won in a
previous round when the bank offer had been accepted. It is important to note that the Chance
round is only ever offered when the two remaining prizes differ by a large magnitude,
highlighting the contrast between the risky and the safe options. For example, in one actual

<-----Page 17----->16
game, the contestant faced a choice between a certain offer of $15,100 and a gamble between
$10 and $75,000. The person chose the sure amount of money. Accepting the "Chance" offer
is not compulsory. In our sample, the Chance option was offered 20 times, with the mean
value of the two cases being $18,229 compared to the considerably lower mean value of
already accepted deals of $9,824. Notwithstanding this, in only 7 Chance rounds was the
suitcase gamble accepted, suggestive of loss aversion at work.
The SuperCase round is played after all suitcases have been opened. If the contestant
elects to take the SuperCase option, they will win whatever cash amount is revealed to be
inside the SuperCase, and forfeit their previously struck deal. In each game where it is
offered, one of the following cash values will be selected at random, and placed inside the
SuperCase: $0.50; $100; $1,000; $2,000; $5,000; $10,000; $20,000; or $30,000. The mean
and standard deviation of the SuperCase option are $8,510 and $11,000 respectively. In our
sample, the SuperCase was offered 24 times, with the contestants having previously accepted
deals ranging from $2,100 to $17,800. The mean of previously accepted deals was $8,750.
For example, in one game, the contestant had previously accepted a Deal of $6,350. After all
suitcases had been revealed, the contestant was offered the SuperCase option. The contestant
accepted, and won $20,000. In only eight SuperCase rounds was the SuperCase chosen.
It can be seen from this description of the two supplementary rounds that they involve
a change in the framing of the choice faced by the contestant. On the one hand, in rounds 1-9,
the contestant chooses whether or not to swap his/her right to a lottery for a sure amount of
money. The choices involve only possible gains, not possible losses. The contestant "owns"
the right to keep removing suitcases until only the suitcase initially nominated remains and to
receive Bank Offers after each round of this process. Each time a Bank Offer is made, the
contestant is being asked to sell this lottery. On the other hand, in the Chance and SuperCase
rounds, the choice is reversed, and the possibility of making a loss is introduced. Specifically,

<-----Page 18----->17
the contestant has already accepted a Deal and is being asked to swap his/her sure winnings
for a gamble. In other words, the contestant is now being asked to buy a new lottery. If the
contestant's current winnings become the new reference point (as suggested by prospect
theory), then accepting either the Chance or SuperCase deals will mean accepting a positive
probability of suffering a loss relative to the reference point and a positive probability of
enjoying a gain relative to the reference point. Specifically, consider the Chance round in
which a person will face a choice between the 2 remaining suitcases or a sure amount of
money. Thus in the Chance round, the contestant chooses between a 50-50 chance of losing
or gaining relative to the reference position or status quo. A person with an S-shaped utility
function which is steeper for losses than gains will be less likely to accept a Chance (or
SuperCase) round gamble.
To explore the issue of loss aversion, we again re-estimate the probit regression but
this time include the impact of the Chance and SuperCase rounds on the willingness of a
contestant to accept an offer. While the offer is usually the Bank Offer, in the Chance and
SuperCase rounds, the offer represents the status quo. The results of this new probit
regression are shown in Table 4.
Panel A of Table 4 contains the results of a Probit for rounds 1-9 that includes
dummies for whether the decision is made during a Chance or SuperCase round. A further
variable, "high cases remaining" is also included. The highcase variable is the proportion of
remaining suitcases that are higher than that round's Bank Offer. We include it to capture the
possible heuristic behaviour by contestants – that the contestant takes account of how many
remaining suitcases are above the Bank Offer for that round.
The Chance and SuperCase dummy variables and the highcase variable are all
statistically significant at the one percent level. Further, the Chance and SuperCase dummies
have a high marginal effect. Males are less likely to accept the Bank Offer in the Chance and

<-----Page 19----->18
SuperCase rounds (i.e. they are more likely to take the gamble by giving up their already won
prize) and are also less likely to be affected by the high case rule of thumb. The statistical
significance and high marginal effect of the dummies for the Chance and SuperCase rounds in
these probit regressions is suggestive of a reference point switching explanation for any
greater reluctance to accept risk in the Chance or SuperCase rounds compared to the scenario
faced in earlier rounds.
Panel B of Table 4 repeats the earlier exercise of comparing the predictive power of
the model against the benchmark. The model performs considerably better than the model in
the previous section, correctly predicting 50% of acceptances and representing an overall 31%
improvement on the benchmark model.
Table 5 tests the same model as outlined in Table 4, but using data only from rounds
6-9. As discussed, almost all of the difficult choices faced by contestants are in rounds 6-9.
Once again, most variables are statistically significant at the one percent level and the Chance
and SuperCase dummies have a high marginal effect. Once more, the highcase variable is
statistically significant and, as expected, its marginal effect is much higher for these later
rounds than it was for the entire sample. Despite a small loss of accuracy on the rejections, we
see a 44% overall improvement on the benchmark.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we analyse a simple lottery-choice setting within the Australian version of the
TV game show, "Deal or No Deal", that allows us to explore a range of issues related to risk
aversion in the context of both very high and wide-ranging (possible) payoffs. Notably, a
feature of the game is especially convenient for testing non-expected utility theories relating
to the effects of changes in reference points.
The main findings of our analysis are easily summarized. First, we generally observe
that as the stakes of this lottery game increase, so to does the degree of risk aversion (similar

<-----Page 20----->19
to Holt and Laury, 2002). Having said that however, we observe considerable heterogeneity in
people's willingness to bear risk – indeed, a sizeable proportion of contestants in our sample
appear to be risk-loving. Moreover, such risk loving behaviour is sometimes evident with
decisions involving very high stakes. We also find heterogeneity with respect to observable
agent characteristics, with age and gender being statistically significant determinants of risk
aversion, while wealth is not.
Second, we are able to exploit a special feature of the game show that sometimes
appears at the final decision-stage and which reverses the choice faced by contestants up till
that time. Specifically, instead of being offered a sure-thing in exchange for a lottery,
contestants who are entitled to end the show with money already secured, are offered a lottery
in exchange for that sure-thing. In this context, we find that the reversal of framing has a
significant impact on people's willingness to bear risk, and that their high level of risk
aversion during the Chance and SuperCase rounds is consistent with the existence of framing
effects.

Table 2: Probit Model of Accepting the Bank Offer in the TV Game Show “Deal or No Deal” – All Nine
Rounds
This table reports the results of two probit regression models of the probability of accepting the bank offer in a given round of the
Australian version of the TV game show “Deal or No Deal”. The data used in this analysis are for the complete set of nine normal
rounds of the game. Panel A shows the probit regressions results for model (1) – no interaction terms and model (2) – including
interaction terms. The dependent variable (DV) takes a value of unity if the bank offer is accepted by the contestant and zero
otherwise. The independent variables are defined as follows: OFFER is the value of the bank offer measured in $10,000 units;
RATIO is the ratio of the bank offer to the expected value of the gamble; MALE is a dummy variable that takes the value of unity if
the contestant is a male; AGE is the contestant’s age measured in years; AGE2 is the square of the contestant’s age measured in
years2; HINCOME is proxied by the average household income associated with the postcode (analogous to zip code) of the
contestant based on data from the 2001 Australian Census. Immediately below each estimated coefficient in parentheses are the
associated z-statistics. The reported coefficient on and marginal effect of AGE2 are both scaled by 103 to enhance readability.
Statistical significance at the 1% and 5% levels is indicated by ** and *, respectively. Panel B shows hit-miss tables associated with
Model (2) estimates reported in Panel A. These contingency tables show a 2x2 scheme of correct and incorrect classifications. In the
left hand side of the panel (‘estimated equation’) the predicted probability of each observation is determined relative to a 0.5
probability cutoff value. In this case a correct classification occurs when the predicted probability ≤ 0.5 (> 0.5) coincides with an
actual value for the dependent variable equal to 0 (1). In the right hand side of the panel (‘constant probability’) a naïve prediction is
made that all observations are equal to the most common case i.e. the offer is not accepted (DV = 0). In this case all DV = 0 (DV =
1) observations are correctly (incorrectly) classified. The ‘predictive ability’ of the model is gauged by a measure of the gain
achieved from applying the probit specification relative to the naïve case, and is recorded as the Total Gain: in percentage points and
Percent Gain: as a percentage of the incorrect classifications in the constant probability model.

* In 41 of the 102 episodes of the game show for which we have data, a new car was substituted as the prize in
place of the $25,000 amount. The car was worth approximately $25,000 and, therefore, for convenience, we used
the monetary value of $25,000 for that suitcase in all instances.
