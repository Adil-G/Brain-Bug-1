ABSTRACT

The ‘credibility gap’ is not often cited as a problem by marketers; for this reason
marketing texts pay little or no attention to it. Yet, for the entrepreneurial marketer it
may well be the most fundamental marketing challenge. Addressing the credibility gap
may not have received any previous research interest, but theoretical support for its
relevance abounds. Risk and its corollary, making use of trust, have been seen as
quintessentially entrepreneurial activities. If they do epitomise entrepreneurship, then
surely, studying how entrepreneurs use trust ought to provide valuable insights into
what entrepreneurs do.
While there is increasing research into trust, particularly from an organisational
behaviour perspective, there is none in an entrepreneurial context. This lack of research
provides the reason for the exploratory nature of this investigation.
The search for trust in this investigation focuses on entrepreneurs’ usage of
elements of the marketing mix. Respondents are asked about what they have done, why
they have taken that course of action and what the outcomes have been.
We find that there is a wide panoply of ways in which entrepreneurs use trust.,
for example ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘shared values’. The latter two are particularly important
because they can lead to trust in situations where there may not already be existing
relationships (the most likely place for finding trust). We also identify the methods
entrepreneurs use to build trust - which they can then use to mitigate customers’
perception of risk.

<-----Page 2----->This paper starts with the presentation of a model which summarises some
existing research into how trust functions, in the light of our findings adaptations to this
model are then made in order to highlight the contribution of this research.

INTRODUCTION

It has been pointed out that the nature of trust varies according to context. However
while there are numerous studies on trust in the fields of marketing and organisational
behaviour e.g. Moorman, Deshpande & Zaltman (1993) and Mayer et al (1995) this is
not the case in entrepreneurship research. Moreover, it has recently been said that ,
‘entrepreneurial activity can be considered in terms of: reassuring potential principals
(customers) of their trustworthiness Shapiro (1987636).
This paper starts with the presentation of a model of trust based on the existing
literature on trust, which is primarily from the fields of marketing and organisation
behaviour. Since our interest is the marketing activities of entrepreneurs establishing
new ventures, we then present the research question which provided the focus for our
research. It should be stressed that the focus of our interest is the establishment of new
ventures (start-ups), for this reason we refer to the principal(s) as entrepreneurs - we
consider this appellation to appropriate, particularly since our respondents were selected
on the basis that they were not going into self-employment, but rather had the intention
to grow.
Subsequently we show how the initial model of trust we presented can be
adapted in the light of the findings from our research. We hope that the adapted model
reflects more realistically the issues surrounding trust facing the entrepreneur. Of course
some of the findings may be of relevance to researchers in other managerial fields.

THETRUSTMODEL

The model which is developed below addressesthe following issues:
1. On what bases should the customer trust the marketer‘? We distinguish between the
entrepreneurs’ characteristics; the rule of law and how they behave.

<-----Page 3----->2. Specifically in terms of the latter we then consider how customers find out whether
the marketer is trustworthy. This is may be through a combination of social
learning, self-disclosure or reputation.
3. This research deals with entrepreneurs who are establishing new ventures and
focuses on their management of trust in their marketing activities. Thus the model
focuses on why others may consider the entrepreneurs themselves to be trustworthy
(based on their behaviour). The answer is because of a possible combination of
antecedents to trust specifically, ability, integrity, and benevolence.
The following three paragraphs summarise the key issues, which are subsequently
considered in more detail.
Why should one individual trust another? This question has been approached
from three distinct perspectives: buses of trust, umecedent factors of trust and furms of
trust. The fundamental distinctions between these approaches are as follows.

The

‘bases of trust’ approach explains that trust may exist due to the rule of law or shared
personal characteristics; moreover, trust may develop due to interpersonal interaction.
The ‘forms’ of trust approach shares some common ground with the above, but
the essential difference appears to be that it allows for the existence of ‘affect-based
trust’ (i.e. people may trust each other because of emotional bonds).
The ‘antecedent factors’ approach appears to be the most holistic of the three
since it seeks to identify specific antecedent factors which may account for the existence
of trust between two people. The approach has advantages since it is possible to
identify different antecedent factors depending on the situation being studied. In
organisational behaviour, for example, benevolence, integrity and ability have been
identified. The discussion below integrates material from the three different approaches.
3.1.

On what basesshould the customer trust the marketer?

seeks to resolve is why

should a customer trust a marketer? This is answered by identifying the bases to trust
i.e. a customer could trust the marketer because of the ‘rule of law’ (institutional based
trust) and/or because of the trustee as an individual (Luhmann 1979). In the latter

<-----Page 4----->instance, the bases for trusting are specifically the trustees’ inherent characteristics
(characteristic based trust) or their previous behaviour, referred to as process based
trust by Zucker (1986).
3.1.1.

Characteristic based trust

Characteristic-based trust only pertains to individuals; it cannot be acquired in the way
that the other two forms of trust can be obtained. Its presence or absence is a cognitive
factor between the focal individual and the third party. It exists if the third party feels
that there is a social similarity between themselves and the focal individual. So, for
example, an exchange partner may consider the ethnic background

of

their

suppliers/customers to be an important factor in exchange since common social and
cultural norms may make a satisfactory exchange easier to achieve.
It should be noted that characteristic-based trust is a commodity which exists
according to the inherent characteristics of an individual and their perception by the
wider social environment.
3.1.2.

Process bused trust

The association between trust and long-term relationships (process based trust) is welldocumented by Good (1988:33), who emphasises that exchanges requiring trust will
not be ahistorical instances, i.e. they will not take place on a one-off basis.
Social exchange theory also shows the association between trust and long-term
exchange. According to Blau (1964), social exchange is embedded in trust. ‘Social
exchange,

therefore

entails

supplying

benefits

that

create

diffuse

future

obligations...since the recipient is the one who decides when and how to reciprocate a
favour, or whether to reciprocate at all so social exchange requires trust . . . typically
however social exchange relations evolve in a slow process, starting with minor
transactions in which little trust is required because little risk is involved and in which
both the partners can prove their trustworthiness’ (Blau 1964:454).
Where, at the start of a relationship, individuals are dealing with strangers, they
do not know to what extent the other party can be trusted and there is little basis for

<-----Page 5----->trust. Scanzoni (1979) suggests that trust is unlikely to appear early in a relationship
because there would be little basis in past experience for its development. In these
situations it is posited that parties will exchange on a basis of little risk and therefore
little need for trust; as parties prove themselves to be trustworthy, more trust will be
placed in them. The following analysis considers the factors at play in the development
of interpersonal trust within long-term exchange relationships.
3.1.3.

Forms of trust

From the preceding argument it may seem that trust is simply a ‘cognitive’ construct
which may develop through an acquisition of information. According to Luhmann,
familiarity is the precondition for trust (i.e. trust requires a degree of cognitive
familiarity or knowledge of the object being trusted). The extent of this knowledge lies
between total ignorance and complete information. The manifestation of trust on the
cognitive level of experience is reached when social actors no longer need or want any
further evidence or rational reasons for placing their trust in third parties.
However, the value of research which deals with the ‘forms’ of trust is that it
distinguishes between ‘affect-based trust’ and ‘cognition-based trust’ (McAllister
1995). The emotional base of trust is argued to be complementary to the cognitive base.
This consists of the emotional bond among those who take part in a relationship. The
emotional basis of trust exists in interpersonal trust, emotional trust can also be present
in public or institutional trust, since the public can feel indignant about the abuse of
power. The emotional content of trust is just as reciprocal and intersubjective as its
cognitive base.
The discussion below considers how individuals find out whether or not others
are to be trusted. We consider three specific methods, social learning, self-disclosure
and reputation.

<-----Page 6----->3.2.

How does the customer find out whether the entrepreneur

is

trustworthy?
There are a number of different methods individuals can use to find out whether
potential trustees are, in
3.2.1.

fact,

trustworthy.

Social learning

The diagram shows that one of the methods the trustor can use, through interpersonal
interaction, to find out whether someone is trustworthy is ‘social learning’, where trust
evolves out of past experience and prior interaction (Rempel et al. 1991). Exchange
partners make dispositional attributions of each other in terms of their reliability and
dependability. Having identitied how a customer can find out that the marketer is
trustworthy, the next issue is what does the customer look for in order to identify
trustworthiness? This is answered in the next box which identifies ‘ability’, ‘integrity’
and ‘benevolence’ as antecedent factors to trust.
The final box shows that when all of the above have been answered it may be
possible to engage in a trusting exchange i.e. the customer’s perceived risk is
overcome, this is referred to as the behavioural enactment of trust. In the diagram it is
shown to be linked to all three bases to trust i.e. the reason why a customer enters into a
trusting exchange is because of their trust in the rule of law, the seller’s characteristics
and past behaviour. Of course the extent to which each basis contributes to the overall
level of trust in each purchase will vary.
Furthermore, the diagram shows that the demonstration and development of
trust between exchange parties is an on-going and iterative process.
3.2.2.

Self-disclosure

Self-disclosure theory provides a model for explaining how individuals are to acquire
information about the trustworthiness of their interaction partners. Trust develops
gradually through repeated encounters involving the potential for rejection or ridicule
(Altman and Taylor 1974; Rubin 1973). However, if agents protect themselves from
the risks of dealing with one another, they eliminate diagnostic opportunities for

<-----Page 7----->leatlling about the dispositional qualities of the partner that relate to trust. In order to
find out that the other person can be trusted they must be given the opportunity to show
that they do not care (Strickland 1958).
3.2.3.

Reputation and process-based trust

Process-based trust develops as individuals demonstrate their trustworthiness

to

exchange partners through concrete actions. Process-based trust cannot be transferred
from one individual to another; it is acquired within the marketplace by a particular
person, institution or brand name with a reputation. The definition of reputation offered
by Zucker is: a symbolic representation of past exchange history; brand name is a
deliberately constructed proxy for reputation (Zucker 1986:62).
3.3.

On what personal bases (antecedents) do others consider entrepreneurs
to be trustworthy?

Mayer et al (1995) provide an explanation as to what the trustor looks for in a trustee.
In their model, trust has specific antecedents which are ‘ability’,

‘integrity’ and

‘benevolence’. Benevolence refers to the extent to which the trustee is believed to want
to do good to the trustor and thereby qualifies the relationship between the trustor and
the trustee. Integrity refers to the trustor perceiving that the trustee adheres to a set of
principles that the trustor tinds acceptable.
In terms of ability, Mayer et al. (1995) draw the following distinction: an
individual may be entrusted to do analytic tasks related to his or her technical area; the
individual may not be trusted to initiate contact with an important customer. Therefore
trust is domain specific (i.e. people have ability in different areas). Ability they consider
to be composed of aptitude, training and experience.
Like previous commentators, Mayer et al. (1995) make the impolTant point that
the demonstration of trust requires there to be risk taking by the trustor: ‘Behavioural
trust is the assuming of risk’(Mayer et al. 1995:724).

<-----Page 8----->3.3.1.

Behavioural

trust

Behaviourally, to trust, is to act as if the uncertain future actions of others are indeed
going to be cer&ain, in situations where the violation of the expectations will yield
negative consequences (Lewis and Weigert 1985:971). Such demonstration of trust
builds trust in the trustee and as such encourages them to act in a trustworthy manner
‘we trust them (trustors) more because trust-implying

behaviour contributes to the

emotional and cognitive foundation of trust’ (Lewis and Weigert 1985:464).
4.

RESEAKCH AGENDA

Since entrepreneurship is associated with ‘risk’ and entrepreneurial activity can
involve passing some of that risk onto other people, logically, in these latter instances
entrepreneurship must also involve getting those people to trust

you.

Furthermore, the

amount of risk someone is willing to take in another person depends 011how much they
trust them. There may well be an iterative process of manipulating the levels of risk and
trust in a new venture, so that an equilibrium is reached when the entrepreneur only
asks others to take as much risk in the venture as the amount of trust they have in him.
Given our view of entrepreneurship as a process which seeks to alive at an
equilibrium, we define the domain of this research was: How do entrepreneurs manage
risk and trust?
At the start-up stage of any venture, when entrepreneurs are trying to acquire
customers, among other resources, the management of risk and trust is of crucial
importance. It is at this time that the venture will have least credibility with the target
customers and, if sufticient credibility is not established, the venture will be still-born.
For this reason the research focuses on the acquisition of customers. The question
driving this research was: how do entrepreneurs explicitly manage customer-perceived
risk at the start of a new venture, and does trust play a role?
The question is phrased in such a way that the focus of the study becomes the
process of new venture management. Our interest is in what entrepreneurs actually do.
Secondly, because we are interested in their motivations for their actions, we restrict

<-----Page 9----->our interest to entrepreneurs’ explicit management of CPR. This is an important
methodological issue; it means that we will not read into entrepreneurs’ descriptions of
their actions as to whether they are managing risk and trust. The identification of
customer-perceived risk and the need to use trust must be explicit in entrepreneurs’ own
words. One of the reasons for taking this approach is to reduce the chances for the
researcher ‘finding’ evidence which may not really be there. This should not deny the
value of future research looking into the implicit management of risk and trust.
Having established the research question, which research design should be used
to answer it? Material for the development of hypotheses or selection of themes can
obviously only come from existing research; for this reason, the following

section

explains which variables may be relevant and where the search for evidence may prove
to be fruitful.
5.

METHOD

Since this was an exploratory study which sought to find out in entrepreneurs’
own terms how they used trust in their marketing activities, in-depth interviews were
undertaken. In an inductive enquiry, even the basis for representativeness is not
known, so there has been no attempt to control for any variables. Instead emphasis has
been put on acquiring a diverse sample of respondents who could provide a large
amount of rich detail. There were 40 respondents, who wcrc selected on bases
identified by Eisenhardt (1989) and Yin (19X4), who says that cases can be selected
because similar results are predicted (literal replication) or to generate different results
for predictable reasons (theoretical replication).
This method of sampling is synergistic with the theory building objective of our
research. The existence of some similar cases and some contrasting ones, makes it
possible to understand the single case finding, generalisations can then be made from
one case to another on the basis of a match to the underlying theory and not to a larger
universe (Miles and Huberman 1994). Given this method for sample selection, the
findings cannot be generalised to a specific population (Yin 1984), instead, the aim is to

<-----Page 10----->generalise to theoretical propositions: ‘the investigator’s goal is to expand and
generalise theories (analytic generalisation) and not to enumerate frequencies’, Yin
(1984:2 1).
Indeed it should be noted that random selection of respondents is not to be
preferred. According to Miles and Hubelman (1994), theoretical sampling means that:
choices of informants, episodes and interactions are driven by a conceptual question not
by a concern for representativeness...Miles and Huberman (1994:29).
Therefore, because of the lack of existing theory relating risk and trust to
marketing in an entrepreneurial context, this research is inductive, because of the need
to develop theory the sample is a heterogeneous one and it is for this reason that the
research method is principally qualitative.
6.

ADAPTING THE TRUST MODEL

TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP

The findings below deal with the usage of trust to mitigate CPR. There are four key
constructs which we have identified which could be added to the trust model.
‘Enthusiasm’ we argue should be considered to be one of the personal traits which
contribute to characteristic based trust. ‘Association’ and ‘shared vision’ we consider to
be two separate antecedents to trust i.e. they are two possible reasons why others
should trust the entrepreneur. Finally ‘forgiveness’ is critical for understanding why
trusting behaviour may persist even where trust has been abused, this is important for
entrepreneurs who may find that they abuse trust, without malevolent intent and need to
maintain others’ trust.
6.1.

Enthusiasm

The word ‘enthusiasm’, as an important characteristic of a firm’s management, was not
a construct for which respondents were specifically asked and given the attention paid
to it by them, it is considered that it is sufficiently important to be analysed further.
The role of ‘enthusiasm’ is most succinctly put forward by respondent 3 1, who
had used the services of an experienced associate to find out from large corporates
whether or not they would be interested in developing the venture. While the associate

<-----Page 11----->is described as being competent, the trial was not successful: ‘At this stage a substitute
for credibility and expertise is enthusiasm’.
This section investigates the meaning of the term ‘enthusiasm’ and the role it
plays in acquiring customers. The question which arises is whether ‘enthusiasm’ is
related to risk and trust or whether it is like ‘inertia’, and is a construct which exists
outside the realms of risk and trust.
6.1.1.

What is enthusiasm?

Unlike concepts such as risk and trust, which have a substantial literature supporting
them, there appear-s to be very little published material on ‘enthusiasm’. For a
definition, the dictionary is the only source for a definition: ‘ardent and lively interest or
eagerness’, Collins Dictionay (1987). The reference to someone who is enthusiastic
being ‘lively’ and ‘eager’ seems to be in line with one respondent’s understanding of
the telm ‘enthusiasm’: ‘I think that [failure to generate interest] is just because we didn’t
have somebody with enough oomph to get there’, I think that [the failure was due to]
his approach, which was, ‘can I come and talk to you about’.
6.1.2.

Whut role does enthusiasm plrcy?

From the definition above it can be surmised that enthusiasm demonstrates the
marketers’ personal interest in the product. With a multitudinous array of products
available to the customer, we argue that it is the enthusiasm of the marketer which tells
the customer that the product being promoted is worth further consideration.
In the first instance, prior to making a purchase, enthusiasm thus encourages
further interest on the part of the customer. It should be stressed that taking note of a
product and finding out more about it do not require trust on the part of the customer,
since such activity does not require the taking of a risk. According to one respondent,
enthusiasm is an alternative to expertise and credibility. The customer may or may not
consider that the entrepreneur has credibility or expertise; however, their willingness to
consider what is being sold, to take more than a cursory interest, will depend on their
perception of the marketer’s enthusiasm.

<-----Page 12----->The question remains as to whether enthusiasm will also lead to customers
making a purchase. The centml tenet of existing literature is that risk cannot be
undertaken if there is no trust. In this respect there are three ways in which enthusiasm
may be categorised:
1. enthusiasm is a component of an antecedent to trust
2. enthusiasm is a component of a basis of trust
3. enthusiasm is neither a component to an antecedent to trust nor a basis of trust
4. enthusiasm may or may not be a component to an antecedent or basis of trust
depending on the context.
The section below considers the theoretical reasons as to whether enthusiasm is a
component of an antecedent to trust or a basis of trust. Whatever the conclusions
reached in that discussion, it can be said here that enthusiasm may play a role in
overcoming customers’ inertia and lethargy and lead to them becoming more aware of
the product/service than they would otherwise have been. In this respect ‘enthusiasm’ is
an important characteristic of the people involved in a new venture, however in this
function it is not related to risk and trust.
6.1.3.

A link between enthusiasm and trust?

It should be noted that in the organisation behaviour literature there has been no
reference made to enthusiasm as an antecedent to trust. The antecedents to which Mayer
et al. (1995) refer are ability, integrity and benevolence. Benevolence refers to the
extent to which the trustee is believed to want to do good to the trustor and thereby
qualifies the relationship between the trustor and the trustee. Integrity refers to the
trustor perceiving that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds
acceptable.
According to an organisational behaviour-based model of trust (Mayer et al.
1995), there is no justification for arguing that enthusiasm is an antecedent to trust.
Nevertheless, this should not discount a role for enthusiasm in a marketing or
entrepreneurial context. The reason is due to the inherent difference between the nature

<-----Page 13----->of dyadic ties within an organisation as opposed to dyadic ties between independent
individuals or organisations.
For example, within organisations, the interaction between individuals is
indiscrete and ongoing: at one extreme, employee contracts may reyuiw contact between
individuals. Employees do not need to be enthusiastic about their work for contact to
take place.
In contrast, in a marketing context, interaction is discrete: what contact there is
has to be deliberate and requires pro-active motivation on the part of individuals for it to
take place. In this framework, enthusiasm may be important because, if the marketer
demonstrates enthusiasm which is shared by the customer, this may be construed as a
sharing of values and may over a period of time lead to trust.
Qualifying the level of enthusiasm is important, because where both parties have
low levels of enthusiasm then although vision is shared there is no motivation to spend
time together. Secondly, where one party has high enthusiasm and the other low
enthusiasm there are no shared values. It is only when a high level of enthusiasm is
shared that values will be shared and enthusiasm may work as an antecedent to trust.
The enthusiasm of entrepreneurs can only be relevant where they are dealing
with small numbers of customers (i.e. business customers or consumers who were
placing orders of relatively high value).
Entrepreneurs use enthusiasm to share their vision and values with their target
customers. Enthusiasm we would argue is a personal trait, some people in terms of
personality are enthusiastic. We would argue that just as the psychology literature on
trust identified that people who are perceived as ‘open’ and ‘trusting’ are likely to be
trusted, so people who are ‘enthusiastic’ may be perceived as trustworthy.
At the start of a venture entrepreneurs may not only have to contend with CPR,
they may also have to overcome customers’ apathy or inertia - in order to do this
enthusiasm can be important.
characteristic based trust.

Moreover enthusiasm can be a component of

<-----Page 14----->6.2.

Association

‘Association’ is a means of acyuiring trust. Entrepreneurs can identify

which

organisations, corporations and individuals already have credibility amongst their target
customers and by association confer such credibility onto themselves. Thus association
is a means of bringing credibility from the external environment into the organisation.
Branding can be used to distinguish the entrepreneur’s offering and also to
acquire trust. Unlike established brands, new brands launched by new ventures have
little or no track-record and the endeavour is towards developing a reputation. One of
the ways in which entrepreneurs can acquire such reputation is to have their brand in
close proximity

to established brands which already enjoy credibility

amongst

customers - this is an example of association serving as an antecedent to trust.
Customers are willing to trust the brand because it is associated with other credible
brands.
In terms of contribution to theory it should be noted that ‘association’ does not
fall into the antecedents to trust already identified in the literature (e.g. Mayer et al.
(1995)). ‘Association’ does not arise out of integrity, benevolence, or ability. It simply
arises from being in the right place. For the new venture, therefore, there may be a
fourth antecedent to trust, namely ‘association’.
6.3.

Shared vision

It is important to distinguish between vision and values, we argue that the former are a
component of ‘ability’.
It has been acknowledged (e.g. Mayer et al. (1995) and Morgan &L Hunt
(1994)), that an antecedent to trust are ‘shared values’, which in the Mayer et al (1995)
argument fall within the wider category of ‘integrity’.

Material from respondents

suggests that, in an entrepreneurial context, trustors can trust trustees because they both
share the same vision. Such vision can relate to what are considered to be appropriate
elements of the marketing mix and future trends in the market place. Moreover, unlike
shared values which are a component of ‘integrity’, we argue ‘shared vision’ is a
component of ‘ability’ (i.e. customers or channel intermediaries trust the entrepreneur

<-----Page 15----->because he demonstrates his ability by presenting a vision of the future which is in
accordance with theirs).
There are three cases from the interviews which lend credence to this notion. A
leisure venture gained support from a government agency, because they felt that the
time had come for this idea. In contrast, a potential publisher had not found support to
date, because potential advertisers did not consider that the concept to have any value.
For some manufacturers, there are two groups of customers, the retailer and the
ultimate consumer. The first person the entrepreneur deals with is the retailer. Retailers’
trust will be obtained if they share the entrepreneur’s vision as to which elements of the
marketing mix will secure sales. The distributors of a snack-food product felt that their
product would be a very important development in the snack-food industry and agreed
to distribute it. They also wrote letters to potential investors and other stakeholders
supporting the venture.
Another set of examples which supports the notion of ‘shared vision’ arises
from the decision to use branding by some respondents. In some instances
entrepreneurs’ decisions regarding branding were influenced by what they felt would
conform to the vision of their channel intermediaries.
Entrepreneurs who use shared vision/values also need to consider that this
means of getting others to trust you requires others to do the sharing. Entrepreneurs
will therefore need to search to find such people.
6.4.

Forgiveness

Situations where customers are willing to forgive entrepreneurs fall into two categories:
1. Where the core benetit does not appear to be affected
2. Where customers believe the marketer is acting out of benevolence and integrity and
in the long-run will provide a quality product or service.
This shows that the relationship between risk and trust is not as straightforward as
some of the existing literature presents it. Evidence from respondents suggests that even
where trust has been ‘abused’ the customer is willing to caily on trusting - rather than
what existing principles would suggest - that customers would take their custom away.

<-----Page 16----->For entrepreneurs to understand why customers forgive and to what extent they
can benefit from the existence of ‘forgiveness’ is a very important issue. This is
because lack of resources means that entrepreneurs may well have to make
compromises on quality and yet retain the goodwill of their customers.
Bitner (1990) finds that employee explanations, offers to compensate and the
appearance of the physical environment can determine how customers perceive the
causes of service failure. In particular Bitner (1990) hypothesised that: ‘less control is
attributed to the firm when the service failure occurs in an organised service
environment than when the event occurs in a disorganised environment’ Bitner et al.
(1990:73).
Thus in instances of service failure customers can be forgiving, i.e. even though
promises have not been kept, they may still trust the marketer if they feel the failure was
beyond the control of the marketer. In the entrepreneurial context the latter may be due
to the age of the business.
7.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper has identified the role of ‘enthusiasm’, ‘association’, ‘shared vision’ and
‘forgiveness’, as constructs which are relevant to the understanding of trust in an
entrepreneurial context. Of course these constructs may play an important role for an
understanding of trust on other contexts as well.
The notion of forgiveness is an important contribution because the abuse of trust
need not necessarily lead to a breakdown of trusting behaviour and the situations in
which forgiveness comes into play is important for those who rely on using trust.
Enthusiasm is also a trait which people often consider to be important amongst
entrepreneurs - this research has provided a possible explanation as to why it can be
important: in two separate ways it may help to develop trust. We have also explained
why enthusiasm may be useful to entrepreneurs in situations where it does not function
as an antecedent to trust. The latter is also an important notion - it is possible for
constructs such as enthusiasm to be antecedents to trust in some but not all situations.
