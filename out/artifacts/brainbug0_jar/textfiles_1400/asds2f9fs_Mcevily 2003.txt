Introduction
In the introduction to this special issue we observed that
empirical research on trust was not keeping pace with
theoretical developments in the field. We viewed this as
a significant limitation and surmised that a special issue
devoted to empirical research on trust would serve as a
valuable vehicle for advancing the literature. In addition
to the lack of empirical research, we would also make the
observation that theories and evidence accumulating on
trust in organizations is not well integrated and that the
literature as a whole lacks coherence. At a general level,
extant research provides "accumulating evidence that
trust has a number of importantbenefits for organizations

and their members" (Kramer 1999, p. 569). More specifically, Dirks and Ferrin's (2001) review of the literature
points to two distinct means through which trust generates these benefits. The dominant approach emphasizes
the direct effects that trust has on important organizational phenomena such as: communication, conflict management, negotiation processes, satisfaction, and performance (both individual and unit). A second, less well
studied, perspective points to the enabling effects of trust,
whereby trust creates or enhances the conditions, such as
positive interpretations of another's behavior, that are
conducive to obtaining organizational outcomes like cooperation and higher performance.
The identification of these two perspectives provides a
useful way of organizing the literatureand generating insight into the mechanisms through which trust influences
organizational outcomes. However, we are still left with
a set of findings that have yet to be integrated on a theoretical level in a way that yields a set of generalizable
propositions about the effects of trust on organizing. We
believe this is due to the fact that research has, for the
most part, embedded trust into existing theories. As a result, trust has been studied in a variety of different ways
to address a wide range of organizational questions. This
has yielded a diverse and eclectic body of knowledge
about the relationship between trust and various organizational outcomes. At the same time, this approach has
resulted in a somewhat fragmented view of the role of
trust in an organizational context as a whole.
In the remainder of this paper we begin to address the
challenge of integrating the fragmented trust literature.
While it is not feasible to develop a comprehensive
framework that synthesizes the vast and diverse trust literature in a single paper, we draw together several key
strands that relate to the organizational context. In particular, our paper aims to advance the literature by connecting the psychological and sociological microfoundations of trust with the macro-bases of organizing.

Specifically, we propose that reconceptualizing trust as
an organizing principle is a fruitful way of viewing the
role of trust and comprehending how research on trust
advances our understanding of the organization and coordination of economic activity. While it is our goal to
generate a framework that coalesces our thinking about
the processes through which trust, as an organizing principle, affects organizational life, we are not Pollyannish:
trust indubitably has a down side, which has been little
researched.
We begin by elaborating on the notion of an organizing
principle and then move on to conceptualize trust from
this perspective. Next, we describe a set of generalizable
causal pathways through which trust affects organizing.
We then use that framework to identify some exemplars
of possible research questions and to point to possible
downsides of trust.

Organizing Principles

As Ouchi (1980) discusses, a fundamental purpose of organizations is to attain goals that require coordinated efforts. Interdependence and uncertainty make goal attainment more difficult and create the need for organizational
solutions. The subdivision of work implies that actors
must exchange information and rely on others to accomplish organizational goals without having complete control over, or being able to fully monitor, others' behaviors.
Coordinating actions is further complicated by the fact
that actors cannot assume that their interests and goals are
perfectly aligned. Consequently, relying on others is difficult when there is uncertaintyabout their intentions, motives, and competencies. Managing interdependence
among individuals, units, and activities in the face of behavioral uncertaintyconstitutes a key organizationalchallenge.
Organizing principles represent a way of solving the
problem of interdependence and uncertainty.An organizing principle is the logic by which work is coordinated
and information is gathered, disseminated, and processed
within and between organizations (Zander and Kogut
1995).1 An organizing principle represents a heuristic for
how actors interpret and represent information and how
they select appropriatebehaviors and routines for coordinating actions.
Examples of organizing principles include: market, hierarchy, and clan (Ouchi 1980). Other have referred to
these organizing principles as authority,price, and norms
(Adler 2001, Bradach and Eccles 1989, Powell 1990).2
Each of these principles operates on the basis of distinct
mechanisms that orient, enable, and constrain economic
behavior. For instance, authority as an organizing principle solves the problem of coordinating action in the face
92

of interdependence and uncertainty by reallocating
decision-making rights (Simon 1957, Coleman 1990).
Price-based organizing principles revolve aroundthe idea
of making coordination advantageous for each party involved by aligning incentives (Hayek 1948, Alchian and
Demsetz 1972). Compliance to internalized norms and
the resulting self-control of the clan form is another organizing principle that has been identified as a means of
achieving coordinated action (Ouchi 1980). We propose
that trust is also an organizing principle and that conceptualizing trust in this way provides a powerful means of
integrating the disparate research on trust and distilling
generalizable implications for how trust affects organizing.
We view trust as most closely related to the clan organizing principle. By definition clans rely on trust
(Ouchi 1980). However, trust can and does occur in organizational contexts outside of clans. For instance, there
are a variety of organizational arrangements where cooperation in mixed-motive situations depends on trust,
such as in repeated strategic alliances (Gulati 1995),
buyer-supplier relationships (Dyer and Chu this issue),
and temporary groups in organizations (Meyerson et al.
1996).
More generally, we believe that trust frequently operates in conjunction with other organizing principles. For
instance, Dirks (2000) found that while authority is important for behaviors that can be observed or controlled,
trust is important when there exists performance ambiguity or behaviors that cannot be observed or controlled.
Because most organizations have a combination of behaviors that can and cannot be observed or controlled,
authority and trust co-occur. More generally, we believe
that mixed or plural forms are the norm, consistent with
Bradach and Eccles (1989). In some situations, however,
trust may be the primary organizing principle, such as
when monitoring and formal controls are difficult and
costly to use. In these cases, trust represents an efficient
choice. In other situations, trust may be relied upon due
to social, rather than efficiency, considerations. For instance, achieving a sense of personal belonging within a
collectivity (Podolny and Barron 1997) and the desire to
develop and maintain rewarding social attachments
(Granovetter 1985) may serve as the impetus for relying
on trust as an organizing principle.

Trust as an Organizing Principle

At a general level trust is the willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations about another's
intentions or behaviors (Mayer et al. 1995, Rousseau et
al. 1998). Because trust represents a positive assumption

about the motives and intentions of another party, it allows people to economize on information processing and
safeguarding behaviors. By representing an expectation
that others will act in a way that serves, or at least is not
inimical to, one's interests (Gambetta 1988), trust as a
heuristic is a frame of reference that allows actors to conserve cognitive resources (Uzzi 1997). Trust makes decision making more efficient by simplifying the acquisition and interpretationof information. Trust also guides
action by suggesting behaviors and routines that are most
viable and beneficial under the assumption that the trusted
counterpartwill not exploit one's vulnerability.
As this discussion demonstrates, trust has been conceptualized as an expectation, which is perceptual or attitudinal, as a willingness to be vulnerable, which reflects
volition or intentionality, and as a risk-taking act, which
is a behavioral manifestation. Although these facets of
trust are closely related, it is important to be clear about
which specific facet is the focus. In this paper, we concentrate on trust as an expectation or an intention because
we are most interested in explaining the behavioral manifestations of trust that shape and influence organizing.
Further, while our definition of trust is inherently relational (i.e., it requires a trustor and a trustee), we also
recognize that there is a dispositional element to trust
(Rotter 1967).
In an organizational context "expectations about another's intentions or behaviors"' include "technically
competent role performance from those involved with us
in social relationships and systems" (Barber 1983, p. 9).
In addition to competence, trust is also based on the anticipated behavioral integrity, and the benevolence of others (Mayer et al. 1995). And, trust is based, in part, on a
"leap of faith" (Lewis and Weigert 1985). Consequently,
while our view of trust includes an element of calculated
expectation, it also encompasses a noncalculative component, recognizing the bounded rationality and uncertainty of organizational life.
In addition to trust, trustworthiness influences the pervasiveness and efficacy of trust as an organizing principle
(although trustworthiness has received far less research
attention than trust). Trustworthiness implies being worthy of having trust placed in one (Barney and Hansen
1994). Because we define trust as an expectation, the distinction between trustworthiness and trust is based on the
actual versus perceived intentions, motives, and competencies of a trustee-the former being trustworthinessand
the latter being trust. Without trustworthiness,trust is not
sustainable. Like trust, we view trustworthinessin an organizational context as a social phenomenon too; meaning that it is not only an inherent quality of an individual,
group, subunit, or organization. An actor may choose to
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 14, No. 1, January-February2003

limit or enhance his/her trustworthiness toward another.
For example, one may refuse to allow oneself to become
a repository of another's trust (Coleman 1988). Thus,
trust and trustworthiness coevolve.
The speed and degree of alignment between trust and
trustworthiness are among the factors that determine the
effectiveness of trust as an organizing principle. In the
case where trustworthyactors are perceived as such, equilibrium is achieved and trust is an effective organizing
principle. In contrast, where opportunistic actors are not
trusted, trust itself is irrelevantand some other organizing
principle is necessary. However when there is a mismatch
between trust and trustworthiness one of several outcomes will occur. In the case where opportunistic actors
are trusted, there are going to be negative consequences
and trust will eventually decline. As a result of the mismatch between trust and trustworthiness, over time equilibrium will be reached where opportunistic actors are
distrusted. Another route to equilibrium exists in cases
where trust and trustworthinessare mismatched: By placing trust, one signals that another is expected to behave
in a trustworthy manner, which can become a selffulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, when trustworthy
actors are not trusted, there is an opportunity cost of unutilized latent trustworthiness.Ghoshal and Moran (1996)
argue that this distrust can also become a self-fulfilling
prophecy, and the trustworthinessof organizationalmembers will decline. Alternatively, this disequilibrium could
remain until trust is eventually ventured. Learning to discriminate between those that are trustworthy and opportunistic requires cumulated and diverse relational experiences. In an organizational context, the nature and
diversity of relational experiences are shaped in part by
the organizational arrangements (e.g., structure, culture,
incentives) that influence and constrain individuals' behaviors (Ferrin and Dirks this issue, Perrone et al. 2003).
In our view, trust influences organizing through two
main causal pathways: structuring and mobilizing. Because the level of trust varies, the way that activities are
organized and coordinated will differ. From a structuring
perspective, trust shapes the relatively stable and enduring interaction patternsin and between organizations. For
example, by influencing the status and reputation of certain actors, trust affects their positions within a social network and changes the shape and structureof the network
itself. In addition, breaches in trust are structuringevents
in the sense that they initiate a reorganizationof the social
system, e.g., certain ties are abandoned while others are
created; some actors become more central in the social
hierarchy, while others are pushed toward the margin and
disconnected from the rest of the network. From a mobilizing perspective trust motivates actors to contribute,

combine, and coordinate resources toward collective endeavors. For example, by increasing openness in knowledge transfer and by speeding the circulation of knowledge, trust facilitates cooperation and joint problem
solving. In the next section, we detail specific structuring
and mobilizing causal pathways that relate trust to organizational outcomes. In developing our ideas about structuring we utilize network terminology. Because trust occurs at both dyadic and organizational levels, network
concepts are particularlyapplicable.

Pathways Through Which Trust Affects
Organizing

We develop the notion of trust as an organizing principle
by articulating the causal pathways through which trust
influences several important properties of organizations.
By "causal pathways" we mean the conceptual logic that
explains how and why trust affects certain elements of
organization. We previously identified two broad causal
pathways: structuring and mobilizing. Within these two
broad categories we now describe specific mechanisms
that we believe to be among the most central for organizing (see Table 1). Specifically, we theorize that trust
operates through the causal pathways to affect two broad
properties of organizations: the interaction patterns and
processes that enable and constrain the coordination of
work among individuals.
We note that the set of mechanisms identified in Table
1 is representativebut not comprehensive. We do not intend to develop an exhaustive inventory of the consequences of trust. Rather, our aim is to articulatethe pathways through which trust influences organizing and to
develop a conceptual framework for integrating research
on trust. The specific mechanisms discussed are intended
to be illustrative of how trust can inform our understanding of organizing. At the same time, we believe that the

structuringand mobilizing categories capturemany of the
key causal chains through which trust affects organizing.
We further recognize that trust not only affects organizing, but also is affected by organizing, although these
latter effects are beyond the scope of this paper.
Structuring
By structuring we mean the development, maintenance,
and modification of a system of relative positions and
links among actors situated in a social space. The result
is a network of stable and ongoing interaction patterns,
both formal (e.g., routines and organizational units) and
informal (e.g., cliques and coalitions). Structuring also
creates social stratification that produces differential
status, power, and knowledge. We argue that trust as an
organizing principle molds the social structureof an organizational system in both of these ways. More specifically, trust influences the density, multiplexity, stability,
and nonredundancy of social structure through the processes of transferability,generative capacity, delayed reciprocity, and role making, respectively.
Transferability and Density. A key assertion of social
capital theory is that network density and closure promote
trust and norms of cooperation (Coleman 1988). We suggest that trust also increases the density and closure of a
network through transferability. The basic premise behind trust transfer is that ratherthan being based on direct
experience with the object of trust, initial trust impressions are based on trust in a source other than the trustee,
such as another individual or collectivity (Stewart this
issue). At an individual level, two people who have little
or no knowledge of each other can develop trust for each
other relatively quickly when they share trust in a common third party. Trust in the third party serves as a proxy
for trust in the unknown counterpart (Simmel 1950,
Krackhardt1992). More specifically, "[a] third party offers to each person a definition of the other as trustworthy.
Each accepts or rejects this definition . . . largely on the
basis of his trust for the third party's judgment" (Strub
and Priest 1976, p. 408). In this way, the third party acts
as an intermediarywho brokers trust (Shapiro 1987). This
is Coleman's (1990) "advisor" form of trust intermediation, whereby a third party makes referrals about the perceived trustworthinessof others. Trust in the thirdparty's
judgment serves as the foundation for trust in an unknown
counterpart.
Another form of trust transferoccurs when an individual transfers the trust in the group to which they belong
to another member of the group with whom they have no
direct history or experience. This is Zucker's (1986)
characteristic-basedtrust, which may be driven by value
congruence as well (Sitkin and Roth 1993). An extension

of this idea appliesto trusttransferto an externalgroup
(thatone is not a memberof). Heretrusttransferis driven
by perceivedsimilarityamongmembersof the collectivity. Individualsformulateperceptionsaboutthe trustworthinessof collective entitiesbasedon theirhistoryof interactionswith individualmembersof the collectivity.
The greaterthe perceivedsimilarityamongmembersof
a collectivity,the morereadilytrustin one membertransfers to trustin others(Williams2001). Clearly,this assumes thatthe signal from the source(e.g., thirdparties
or collectivities)is reliableand accurate.
Trusttransferimplies the formationof a new relationship betweenpreviouslyunacquaintedindividuals(or, as
we discuss in the next section,the creationof a new dimension of a previouslymore limited relationshipbetween two people). Consequently,transferabilityhelps
explain how an individual'snetworkgrows in size and

thatcould resultin exclusionarynetworks,a reductionin
the flow of novel information,and the lack of flexibility
and adaptability(Uzzi 1997).

The gradualexpansionof relationshipsto incorporate

initially,the partiestakesmallrisksto assess eachother's

social interactions,the partiesupdatetheir information

Chu 2003), which results in more stable and durable relationships (Molm et al. 2000) and, by extension, organizational networks. Whenever exchange is not instantaneous, there necessarily will be some temporary
inequity in outcomes between exchange partners. Time
lags in the completion of exchange introduce risk for the
parties who first fulfill their obligations in an exchange
(Coleman 1988). One risk is that compensation will be
delayed beyond an acceptable period of time or will not
be forthcoming at all. A second risk is that when the
goods being exchanged are not perfectly fungible the
equality in value may be unclear or questionable. Trust
reduces the need for perfect congruence in value in a single exchange because there is an expectation that balance
will be reached across a series of exchanges that occur
over the course of an ongoing relationship. Trust also
reduces the need for instantaneous compensation because
each party is confident that commitments will be honored
at some point in the future. More generally, trust creates
the conditions for expecting serial equity to occur. Specifically, the expectation that the relationship will continue for the foreseeable future (Axelrod 1984, Heide and
Miner 1992) and the expectation that a counterpart has
taken the focal actor's interests to heart are preconditions
for serial equity to occur. Both expectations are an outgrowth of trust.
The ability for an organization to operate on the basis
of serial equity provides it with a degree of flexibility
because the completion of exchanges can take place over
time and through a variety of different currencies, e.g.,
exchange in kind (Ouchi 1980). Serial equity also increases the capacity of an organization to handle uncertainty while maintaining its basic structure. Uncertainty
creates the need to alter the terms of agreements and
adjust the design and operation of coordination mechanisms to respond to unforeseen events. By allowing the
parties to search for the resolution of inequities across
time and across exchanges, serial equity makes both
structures and agreements more resilient. Serial equity
alleviates the need for renegotiation of agreements each
time there is a change that affects the relationship. Moreover, the trust that supports serial equity also eases the
adjustment process by reducing the likelihood that it will
generate conflict and eventually lead to a breach in the
relationship (Carson this issue, Zaheer et al. 1998). In
some cases, however, delayed reciprocity may actually
reduce a party's ability to extricate itself from relationships that have ceased to generate value or have become
less valuable than other opportunities. For instance, a
purchasing manager may feel compelled to continue
dealing with a particular supplier, even when better alternatives exist, because of outstanding obligations to
that supplier representative.

Role Specialization and Nonredundancy. We propose
that a fourth way that trust affects the structuringin organizations is by reducing redundancy in a network
through the establishment of specialized roles. As mentioned previously, structuringalso includes the differentiation of roles and positions within a social system. By
designating differentiated roles and positions, the members of a unit or organization rely on a particularindividual to act on behalf of that unit or organization (e.g., leaders, liaisons, or boundary spanners). In many cases,
specialized roles act as a bridge between otherwise disconnected individuals, units, or organizations, which
makes trust in the role occupant a relevant consideration.
For example, one important structuring act that individuals in specialized boundary-spanning roles can perform on behalf of a unit or organization is to extend a
link to another unit or organization and serve as a broker.
In the absence of trust, delegating the power to establish
and maintain linkages with external actors would be exceedingly difficult. Trust engenders confidence that the
brokeris conveying accurate and timely informationfrom
and to external actors, rather than selectively filtering
what is shared with other members of the unit or organization. Trust also creates the expectation that brokers
will provide access to valuable contacts and referrals
when possible, ratherthan the brokersreserving exclusive
ties for themselves. In the absence of trust,the other members of a unit or organization may grow suspicious about
whether the broker is playing their interests off of those
of external actors to advance his/her own interests (see,
for example, the discussion of the tertius gaudens strategy
in Burt 1992 and Simmel 1950). Consequently, each
member of the unit or organization may seek to establish
their own connections with external actors in an effort to
bypass the broker, leading to an increase in the redundancy of ties. However, when trust is relied upon to delegate responsibility to brokers, the organization is exposed to certain risks. For instance, the departure of a
trusted broker may jeopardize relationships with external
parties or compromise information access.
Reducing redundancy provides organizations with a
measure of efficiency because it allows for a fixed amount
of network time to be spread over a larger and more diverse set of contacts. And, the expanded reach of a unit
or organization that nonredundancy affords increases the
prospects of discovering novel and diverse opportunities
for creating value. We should note that we do not view
the effect of trust on reducing redundancy as contradictory with trust increasing network density or closure. The
two effects refer to two different aspects of network structure. The effect of trust on density and closure highlights
the ongoing pattern of interaction. In contrast, the effect
ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol. 14, No. 1, January-February2003

<-----Page 7----->BILL McEVILY, VINCENZOPERRONE,AND AKBAR ZAHEER Trustas an OrganizingPrinciple

of trust on redundancy points to the social stratification
and role differentiation that occurs within networks. The
two effects parallel the two distinct structuringprocesses
that we highlighted at the beginning of this section. Moreover, high network density within the organizational unit
can coexist with low redundancy of ties with external
actors. In fact, recent research (Burt 2000, Reagans and
Zuckerman 2001) suggests that this may be an optimal
configuration for accessing and disseminating knowledge.
Mobilizing
Mobilizing is a second causal pathway through which
trust affects organizing. By mobilizing we mean the process of converting resources into finalized activities performed by interdependent actors. Resources, both material and nonmaterial (such as time, effort, attention, and
knowledge), are decentralized and unevenly distributed
among actors. Mobilizing involves motivating actors to
contribute their resources, to combine, coordinate, and
use them in joint activities, and to direct them toward the
achievement of organizational goals. Mobilizing results
in organizational action and, we argue, trust influences
the pathways through which such actions arise. Specifically, trust influences the processes of knowledge sharing,
committing, and safeguarding through the mechanisms of
disclosing and screening, identifying, and suspending
judgment, respectively.
Disclosing, Screening, and Knowledge Sharing. Trust
encourages knowledge sharing by increasing the disclosure of knowledge to others and by granting others access
to one's own knowledge (Dirks and Ferrin 2001). Trust
also reduces the screening of knowledge received from
others. This highlights the fact that trust affects knowledge sharing in two ways: from the point of view of the
receiver and of the sender of knowledge.
From the perspective of the knowledge sender, trust in
a receiver reduces concerns about knowledge appropriation and misuse. Organizational actors are expected to be
more willing to share sensitive and proprietary details
about themselves, others, and their unit or organization
when trust is in place. For example, a subordinate that
trusts his manager will be more inclined to reveal his
limits in skills and abilities because he expects that his
manager will not use the disclosure of this knowledge
against him. And, managers of different units of an organization are more likely to convey knowledge about
innovations and best practices when they are confident
that their counterparts will not divulge such knowledge
to competitors or other actors that could undermine the
value of the knowledge. More generally, a sender's trust
in a receiver influences the sender's degree of openness
ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol.14, No. 1, January-February
2003

in sharing knowledge with the receiver (Nahapiet and
Ghoshal 1998, Ouchi 1981). Such openness provides the
foundation for organizational learning because it increases the potential for the exploitation of knowledge to
be more widely dispersed and because it creates the conditions for the exploration of how knowledge can be recombined in novel ways.
From the standpoint of the receiver, trust affects the
perceived veracity of knowledge. When knowledge is received from a trusted source, the receiver is less likely to
verify the knowledge for accuracy and is more inclined
to accept the knowledge at face value. This allows the
receiver to immediately act on the knowledge and use it
to generate additional knowledge. In this way, the receiver uses the trustworthiness of the source as a proxy
for the quality and veracity of the knowledge conveyed.
This further highlights how trust works as a heuristic to
conserve cognitive effort. Without trust, receivers would
have to expend time and effort verifying the accuracy and
validity of knowledge received, rather than immediately
using and refining the knowledge. Another way that trust
acts as a heuristic in knowledge sharing is by allowing
the receiver to economize cognitive effort in locating the
most relevant and useful knowledge. Because the receiver
expects the source to take the receiver's best interests into
consideration, the receiver can assume that the knowledge
conveyed is important and relevant. As a consequence,
knowledge from a trusted source changes the cognitive
map of the receiver by directing her attention and search
toward the domain of the transferred knowledge. Such
shortcuts in knowledge acquisition can speed organizational learning, alertness, and responsiveness. On the contrary, knowledge transferred from a source that is not
trusted is less likely to have the capacity to reorient a
receiver's attention, to be stored in memory, and to be
immediately used in the production of new knowledge.
At the same time, there are limits to the effectiveness
of sharing knowledge solely on the basis of trust. Even
the most reliable and best-intentioned source can mistakenly share knowledge that is inaccurate, invalid, or
outdated. This is one reason why organizations that rely
excessively on trust as an organizing principle may experience strategic blindness, overconfidence, inertia, or
the inability to innovate.
Identifying and Committing. The social identity literature has shown that identity fosters trust (e.g., Kramer
1993). Lewicki and Bunker (1996) suggest that a reciprocal effect may operate as well; trust strengthens identity. An initial stage of calculus-based trust is followed

97

<-----Page 8----->BILL McEVILY, VINCENZOPERRONE,AND AKBAR ZAHEER Trust as an Organizing Principle

by knowledge-based trust, which in turn develops into
identification-based trust. "As the parties come to learn
more about each other [through knowledge-based trust],
they may also begin to identify strongly with others'
needs, preferences, and priorities and come to see them
as their own" (Lewicki and Bunker 1996, p. 125). The
literature on social identity suggests that identification
can increase the salience of group goals and values, and
increase the perception that an actor's own goals and values are similar to those of other group members (Kramer
and Brewer 1984, Krameret al. 1996).
As identification intensifies, the strengthof attachment,
or commitment, to a collectivity and their objectives increases as well (Kramer 1993). Identificationfosters commitment by shaping expectations about the behaviors and
intentions of the members of a collectivity. Specifically,
"when ingroup members perceive similarities in goals
and values, they believe that other ingroup members are
more likely to behave in accordance with these values
(i.e., beliefs about ingroup members' integrity) and that
ingroup members are more likely to care about goals that
are good for all group members (i.e., beliefs about ingroup members' benevolence)" (Williams 2001, p. 382).
The cognitive processes of social categorization and ingroup bias tend to lead people to make positive attributions about the cooperativeness and commitment of other
ingroup members (Kramer 1999; Brewer 1981, 1996).
The expectation that other members of a collectivity are
willing to cooperate partially determines an individual's
own willingness to cooperate and commit to collective
efforts (Brann and Foddy 1988, Kramer 1991, Messick
et al. 1983). Shared identity also increases the perception
of interdependence and common fate with a collectivity
(Gaertneret al. 1999, Kramer 1991), which are key components of commitment and cooperation. When individuals are committed to a collectivity, they are more loyal
to it and are more willing to invest their time, effort, and
attention on behalf of it.
Over-identification, however, carries its own set of
problems for the organization: Organizational members
are less likely to countenance alternative views and critically evaluate their own organization resulting in groupthink, the not-invented-here syndrome, and other forms
of constrained thinking. In extreme cases, overidentification can engender inertia and core rigidities that
may hinder the organization's ability to adapt and respond to environmental change.
Suspending Judgment and Safeguarding. Trustreduces
the inclination to guard against opportunistic behavior
(e.g., through monitoring and safeguarding) by encouraging actors to suspendjudgment of others (Bromiley and
98

Cummings 1995). By suspending judgment we mean
adopting an orientation toward anotheractor that assumes
the other party's intentions and motives are benevolent,
or at least benign. It involves giving others the "benefit
of the doubt" when uncertainties arise or potential conflicts emerge (Carson this issue). For instance, when an
apparent breach of an agreement occurs, the parties do
not immediately assume that their counterparthas sought
to take advantage of them. Suspending judgment is the
opposite of being calculating and attempting to specify
in as much details as possible the terms of an agreement.
In the absence of trust, monitoring and safeguarding
are measures used to manage uncertainty by influencing
others' behaviors and protecting oneself. As Ouchi
noted, "People must either be able to trust each other or
to closely monitor each other if they are to engage in
cooperative enterprises" (1979, p. 846). This suggests
that relying on trust as an organizing principle entails
relaxing oversight and granting autonomy to others. For
example, one way trust reduces safeguarding is by allowing actors to accept incomplete contracts or agreements based on the expectation that their counterpart
will not exploit their tolerance for ambiguity. Trust gives
actors the confidence that they will be able to work
things out with their counterpartin an equitable and reasonable manner as unforeseen contingencies arise in the
future (Dore 1983, Macneil 1980). By reducing efforts
and investments in taking precautions against potential
losses, trust liberates resources that can be put to better
use. Monitoring and safeguarding generally represent
nonproductive organizational activities (McAllister
1995). As a consequence, trust reduces transaction costs
(Dyer and Chu 2003, Zaheer et al. 1998). Moreover,
trust grants a degree of flexibility and adaptability to the
process of organizing, enabling the parties to exploit opportunities to generate transaction value (Zajac and
Olsen 1993). Taken together, the lowering of transaction
costs and the enhancement of transaction value may represent a sustainable source of competitive advantage
(Barney and Hansen 1994). Of course, the transaction
cost savings and value creation stemming from the use
of trust are premised on a close alignment of trust with
trustworthiness. Where trust exceeds trustworthiness,
the trustor risks hold-up, adverse selection, and moral
hazard (Barney and Hansen 1994).
Moreover, the use of legalistic "remedies" in organizations where interpersonalrelations are strained can actually inhibit and undermine the development of trust.3
While the adoption of bureaucraticprocedures and controls can engender a sense of reliability in an organization, these same mechanisms often thwart efforts to

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/VOI. 14, No. 1, January-February 2003

<-----Page 9----->BILL McEVILY, VINCENZOPERRONE,AND AKBAR ZAHEER Trust as an Organizing Principle

achieve the congruence of values that serves as a foundation for trust (Sitkin and Roth 1993). Excessive monitoring and safeguarding have the potential of becoming a
self-fulfilling prophecy. In the same way that trust begets
trust (Lewis and Weigert 1985), formal control mechanisms can foster attitudes of ill-will, skepticism, and distrust by signaling suspicion. In addition, when organizations limit the role autonomy of their agents, it is more
difficult to ascertain the trustworthinessof individuals because their true intentions and motives are masked by
excessively restrictive role constraints (Perrone et al. this
issue). In such circumstances it is difficult to determine
if observed trustworthy behaviors are a result of the individuals' volition or role constraints. For trustto emerge,
organizations must grant agents the freedom to use their
own discretion as a means of conveying their willingness
to fulfill obligations and meet the positive expectations of
those with whom they deal.

Stepping Back and Looking Forward
Trust as an Organizing Principle
Trust as an organizing principle is sometimes looked at
with suspicion as a premoder concept that provides a
slippery basis for the organization and coordination of
economic transactions (Williamson 1993). From this perspective, rational economic actors should not rely on trust
when managing interdependencies and the allocation of
scarce resources. Moreover, Williamson argues that the
need for personal acquaintance reduces the likelihood of
economic exchanges among strangers, thereby limiting
economic progress. Accordingly, trust binds and blinds,
making economic actors insufficiently vigilant and excessively vulnerable.
We believe that the Williamsonian view reflects an
under-socialized view of the organization and coordination of economic activity and the relationships between
economic actors, based on a limited understandingof how
trust really works. Rather than limiting economic progress, trust in fact is a basic necessity for virtually all forms
of exchange (Arrow 1974). From our perspective, trust
expands the opportunity set for the coordination of work
both inside and outside the organization (Barney and
Hansen 1994). Without trust, the uncertainty that pervades the organization and coordination of economic activity would be debilitating. Although trust is not the only
solution to the organization of work, trust can generate
efficiencies by conserving cognitive resources, lowering
transaction costs, and simplifying decision making.
Moreover, trust may enhance the value of transactions
(Zajac and Olsen 1993).
ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol. 14, No. 1, January-February2003

The Williamsonian view of trust is also inaccurate because individuals in an organizational context do not trust
unconditionally. Trust is not a naive faith, where people
take for granted the reliability, competence, and integrity
of their counterpartbased on a decision made in the distant past. Those that do would rightly be considered gullible. On the contrary, individuals in an organizational
context periodically process information and clues about
their counterpartsto assess: the fragility of trust, whether
it is appropriatelyplaced, how they should interpretcontradictory events and behaviors, and if and when they
should increase their trust and vulnerability. Trust requires intermittent information processing because it is
an intrinsically social organizing principle. Members of
organizations actively probe their counterparts to see if
they can maintain or increase their level of trust. This is
the case, for example, when a supervisor assigns a more
difficult than usual job to a subordinate she wants to test
before risking her credibility by recommending him for
a promotion. This is also the case when a client company
asks its supplier to collaborate in the development of a
new product before placing new orders, or when two
firms spend time in an alliance with each other before
agreeing to merge.
It is this fragility of trust that lends it its heuristic quality, ratherthan being something that can be decided with
precision, once and for all. Trust operates like a "rule of
thumb," using the information that is available to formulate an expectation, rather than acquiring all of the
relevant information to make a comprehensive, rational
decision. The gaps in information and uncertainties that
preclude quantification are what necessitate "judgment
calls" and "leaps of faith" based on social knowledge.
These are also the very elements that distinguish the
placement of trust from the calculation of risk. Nevertheless, the fragility of trust does not imply that it is an antiquated or irrelevant concept for understanding moder
organizations. Indeed, trust is seen as a critical feature of
several contemporary organizational forms, such as strategic alliances, distributed groups, electronic commerce,
and knowledge-intensive organizations. More generally,
whenever actors are simultaneously dependent on and
vulnerable to the actions and decisions of others, trust is
a relevant organizing principle that warrants consideration.
The Downside of Trust
Our focus on the propertiesof trust as an organizing principle should not, however, blind us to the considerable
downside of trust. Scholars have noted that trust by itself
does not guarantee trustworthybehavior; in fact, it may
lead to even greater fraud than if it were absent

99

<-----Page 10----->BILL McEVILY, VINCENZOPERRONE,AND AKBAR ZAHEER Trust as an Organizing Principle

(Granovetter 1985, Shapiro 1987). This arises not only
from misplaced trust, but also from a surfeit of trust. Despite careful calibration, trust in organizational contexts
includes a probabilistic leap of faith, which may lead the
trustor astray. As situations change, supporting commitments may unconditionallybecome untenable for individuals and organizationsat some stage. It is in such situations
that the need arises for "pardonsand paroles" to smooth
over and maintainamicable and trustingorganizationaland
interorganizationalrelationships (Doz and Hamel 1998).
From a research perspective, this suggests that rebuilding
trust-in additionto creating and maintainingit-is an important area of study; one that organizationalresearchers
have only begun to consider (Ferrin2002).
Another downside of trust draws from its heuristic
quality. Using "rules of thumb"to formulate expectations
about the trustworthinessof others is expedient and quite
often reasonably accurate (Ferrin and Dirks this issue).
However, as with cognitive heuristics (Kahneman et al.
1982) trust as a heuristic may produce systematic biases
that can result in judgments that are substantially flawed
and costly. The identification of such biases, and the conditions conducive to formulating faulty assessments of
trustworthiness, represent important areas for future research. Indeed, little systematic research exists on the
downside of trust, with some notable exceptions (e.g.,
Soda and Usai 1999, Gulati and Gargiulo 1999). We believe that the structuringand mobilizing causal pathways
described above can guide research in this area, as we
have illustrated and highlighted for each mechanisms. To
advance our understandingof trust as an organizing principle, attention to both its beneficial and detrimental effects is required.Moreover, quite apartfrom the downside
of trust are the costs involved in creating, upholding, and
maintaining trust. Research has also neglected this aspect
of trust, which is likely to have a significant bearing on
the trade-offs inherent in establishing trusting relationships and on the overall efficiency of trust as an organizing principle.
Implications for Future Research
By conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle we
believe that researchers are able to consider traditional
perspectives of organizations anew. For instance, trust
makes organizations more organic in the sense that members do not need to rely exclusively on mechanistic coordination devices and impersonal rules to manage interdependence in the face of uncertainty. Considering trust
as an organizing principle also furthers our thinking on
the configuration of organizations. Organizational forms
are the outcome of the workings of dominant organizing
principles and, in theory, should have different characteristics depending on the underlying principle. A form
100

where trust is the dominant organizing principle should
have a different structureand set of behaviors than a form
where authority or price predominate.
Viewing trust as an organizing principle also calls into
question our understanding of the issue of organizationenvironment fit (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967, Thompson
1967). It suggests that the realization of an organizational
form depends on not only environmental contingencies,
but also on ingrained organizing principles that act as
implicit frameworks for establishing relationships and
fostering behavior. Organizationalforms can accordingly
be viewed as partially closed systems that are shaped by
the organizing principles that its members internalize. As
with the concept of equifinality (von Bertalanffy 1968),
organizations structuredin accordance with different organizing principles may change in response to external
stimuli in different, but equally effective ways, while
keeping intact the core organizing principle. Such stability may counterbalance the pressures for destabilizing
change and assure the identity and continuity to organizational forms in the face of changing strategic priorities
and external stimuli. How resistant organizing principles
are to changes in external environments (whether trust
when employed as a dominant organizing principle is
more or less susceptible to external change than other
organizing principles) and with what consequences are
importantquestions for future research.
Apart from casting new light on existing organizational
perspectives, we also believe that conceptualizing trustas
an organizing principle stimulates novel and fresh avenues of organizational research. The structuringand mobilizing mechanisms described earlier provide fodder for
further theoretical development and empirical investigation. For instance, the structuringmechanisms encourage
us to think about how trust defines and alters the character
and capacity of a network of stable and ongoing interaction patterns. This entails a subtle but important shift
in research attention from trust in dyadic relations to trust
in aggregate social systems. Research topics representative of this line of inquiry might include questions addressing: the establishment of trust as a reputationwithin
an organization or community (transferability and density); how trust can be signaled or used strategically to
influence others and enhance centrality and power (transferability and density); the role of trust in promoting new
organizational arrangementsconducive to innovation and
value creation (generative capacity and multiplexity);
how trust affects the resiliency, or inertia, of organizations to exogenous shocks (delayed reciprocity and stability); and, the role of trust in legitimating individuals
across organizational boundaries (role making and nonredundancy). The mobilizing mechanisms, on the other

hand,drawour attentionto the role of trustas a theory
of actionin organizations.Trustprovidesa powerfullens
for scrutinizing the social motives driving individuals to
combine their efforts toward common goals. Examples of
research topics based on the mobilizing processes include: the extent to which trust defines the propriety and
exclusivity of knowledge and the efficacy of learning in
organizations (disclosing, screening, and knowledge
sharing); how trust within (e.g., among peers) and across
(e.g., subordinates in managers) levels of organizations
moderates motivational dynamics such as the acceptance
of goals, interpretation of feedback, and perceptions of
equity (identification and committing); and, the means by
which trust translatesinto efficiency gains and value creation (suspending judgment and safeguarding). While by
no means comprehensive, these research questions do illustrate the trajectory of new research directions that are
generated by conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle.
One additional issue that we believe is important for
future research is laying to rest questions about the definition of trust. While the field has made important advances in defining trust, from an empirical standpointdefinitional issues have continued to stymie progress as
researchers conceptualize and operationalize trust in different ways. For instance, we observed earlier that trust
could be an expectation, a willingness, and a behavior.
Rather than debating which of these definitions is more
correct, we believe that the field would be better served
by researchers acknowledging that trust is a multifaceted
concept, clearly identifying which definition is most relevant for their particular research question, and applying
that definition consistently.

Conclusion
Researchon trustin an organizationalcontexthas made
considerablestridesin recentyearsas an impressivebody
of knowledge has accumulated on the topic. To leverage
the progress made thus far, and to ensure that continuing
research has enduring effects on organizational science
more broadly, it is important to clarify the pathways
through which trust affects the organization and coordination of economic activity. Our paper aims to advance
the literature by connecting the psychological and sociological micro-foundations of trust with the macro-bases
of organizing. The framework developed here represents
a step in this direction, one that we hope will be followed
by additional efforts to further articulate the significance
of trust for organizational life.
