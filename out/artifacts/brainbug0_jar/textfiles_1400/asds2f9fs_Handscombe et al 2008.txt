Abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to focus on the attempts to implement the challenges of teaching
enterprise to science and engineering students by the embedding approach chosen by the White Rose
Centre for Enterprise (WRCE), one of the centres formed under the Science Engineering Challenge in
the UK.
Design/methodology/approach – WRCE’s objective was to have departmental science and
engineering staff teach enterprise modules as part of their overall departmental teaching and to have
such modules integrated into the course provision. The WRCE approach emphasized the value of
giving students some real life or simulated “real” experience and of developing a strand or track of
enterprise through the years of the course.
Findings – The general propositions of WRCE are reviewed in the light of the outcomes in a number
of departments, but most specifically within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Sheffield,
which would claim to be one of the most successful departmental interventions of WRCE. Whilst good
examples of embedded modules exist, the successful results in Mechanical Engineering appear to
depend on the appointment of non-traditional staff, the integration of enterprise in a track broader than
enterprise and leadership of that track that has the confidence and resource to deliver its agenda in
part using external rather than internal teaching.
Originality/value – The embedding of enterprise learning into an engineering curriculum and a
mechanical engineering degree program in particular, is discussed from the perspective of the
programme leadership, the sponsoring body and the implementing instructor.

Introduction
The Science Enterprise Challenge (SEC) was established in a UK Government White
Paper (Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 1998) and launched in 1999. Awards
were made in autumn 2000 and by the end of that year, there were 12 centres involving
33 universities. The government’s objective was “culture change” to increase wealth
creation, via improved technology transfer from the university research base and the
introduction of enterprise modules into science and engineering degrees (Handscombe,
2003).
In 1999, much of the enterprise teaching provision to science and engineering
students was from business schools and recent mapping (National Council for

Graduate Entrepreneurship (NCGE), 2007) indicates that this remains the case –
though there are questions concerning the extent of data collection and of mapping
module titles and not necessarily module content.
Some of the centres formed by SEC were based in business schools and have
extended that provision, others, such as White Rose Centre for Enterprise (WRCE),
were formed separately from a business school and committed at the outset to an
approach of embedding enterprise within science and engineering departments. The
approach within WRCE was for minimal central support and direct interaction with
those staff in science and engineering departments who wished to introduce enterprise
at each of the three collaborating universities – Leeds, Sheffield and York. Thus,
enterprise was intended to become part of the provision of a department and taught by
the members of staff in the department.
Neither enterprise as a topic nor enterprise modules for science and engineering
students were new in 1999. For example, Babson College, then Babson Institute traces
its enterprise teaching back to the early part of the twentieth century and Stevenson
and Gumbert (1985) in a paper characterising entrepreneurial management comment
wryly that enterprise was back in fashion, again. In UK business schools, enterprise
teaching can be traced back to the 1970s (Watkins and Stone, 1999) and over the years
a range of provision has developed, from a rather academic and theoretical approach to
a more practical, applied approach of preparing students for entrepreneurship (Gibb,
2002). Academic research into the subject has generated a number of theoretical
propositions, most prominently characterized by opportunity recognition or
personality frameworks (Alvarez, 2005).
Content is, of course, essential but much literature also stresses the way the material
is delivered and the desirability of enabling students to experience, as far as possible
what Gibb terms “the feel” of entrepreneurship. In this context, there are strong
arguments in favour of group learning and more specifically, group or cooperative
learning that focuses on solving problems (Smith et al., 2005; Curran and Stanworth,
1989).
The outcome is intended to be a more valuable set of graduates – ones that are
able to show more initiative, solve more problems, be more creative, more flexible
and in so doing revitalize economies and create wealth and jobs. To do this,
enterprise education needs to provide appropriate information and knowledge in
useful frameworks, with the necessary skills development content whilst meeting
the individual learning needs of the student – not least to enthuse them to behave
entrepreneurially (i.e. to take risks; to start and manage new ventures) (Bechard and
Toulouse, 1998).
The emphasis on skills and on the personal or psychological development of the
students makes entrepreneurship an unlikely candidate for a traditional academic
subject. Module design requires a synthesis of information provision (students need to
know something about enterprise) with the development of relevant skills (so that they
are equipped for the task of enterprise) and delivered in such a way they get to
understand the interpersonal and emotional aspects and get a feel of what is involved
(a journey that takes them through an enterprise experience).
SEC provided the opportunity for new infrastructure support to introduce
enterprise into the science and engineering curriculum and clear arguments existed
to do this in specialist centres outside of business schools (Berlin Institute of

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded by Temple University At 16:08 24 July 2015 (PT)

Entrepreneurship, 1999). Equally clearly, such specialist centres, by their very
nature require funding and without institutional support, they are vulnerable when
external grants expire (McMullan and Long, 1987). Yet without such centres
existing it is difficult to see a sustained strategy of embedding enterprise. Staff in
the science and engineering departments – particularly staff new to enterprise
teaching – can be expected to require a level of support to develop and to learn that
is beyond the provision that is available from those staff in other science and
engineering departments who have begun to embed enterprise teaching in their
modules.
It is the task of equipping existing staff in science and engineering departments to
teach enterprise that is central to the success of an embedding strategy. Two specific
pieces of guidance can be identified (Hytti and O’Gorman, 2004). First the
encouragement for the specialist centre to achieve its targets of an increased number
of students taking enterprise modules by focusing on the staff rather than the students;
a strategy of training the trainers rather than the students. Second, in the departments,
the specialist centre and the university itself, the need for policy makers to be clear
about the rather vague and overused phrase “enterprise learning” and to identify what,
for them is its meaning in their context. This second aspect can be taken further, to
establish a third guidance, one of policy articulation – in vice chancellor
pronouncements of the type of university; of the characteristics of a particular
university’s graduates (Ashworth, 1982); and in the web pages and prospectuses of the
departments claiming to have embedded enterprise.
The challenge of introducing enterprise into the engineering curriculum had been
made easier than for the sciences as a consequence of the clarity of statements from the
engineering accreditation bodies, Accreditation Board for Engineering and
Technology (see www.abet.org) in the USA and Standards and Routes to
Registration (SARTOR) in the UK. SARTOR (www.engc.org.uk/UKSPEC/SARTOR/
default.aspx) for example sets out an agenda for engineers to “have the capability and
competence to match the SARTOR definition”:
Chartered Engineers are concerned primarily with the progress of technology through
innovation, creativity and change. They develop and apply new technologies; promote
advanced designs and design methods; introduce new and more efficient production
techniques and marketing and construction concepts; and pioneer new engineering
services and management methods. They may be involved with the management and
direction of high-risk and resource intensive projects. Professional judgment is a key
feature of their role, allied to the assumption of responsibility for the direction of
important tasks, including the profitable management of industrial and commercial
enterprises.

The considerable enterprise content of this definition is highlighted here by the
authors’ use of italics.
This paper reviews the ambition and rhetoric of the WRCE and compares it
with some of the outcomes in science and engineering departments at one of its
universities

(including funding support) with staff in science and engineering departments whose
bids for support to introduce enterprise met with the criteria of the WRCE enterprise
learning development panel. The clear and stated objective was for enterprise to
become part of the provision of a department, taught by the members of staff in the
department.
The consequence of this objective was the requirement to integrate enterprise
modules or enterprise elements in non-enterprise modules in such a way as to provide a
coherent student learning experience. It has been proposed (Handscombe et al., 2005)
that enterprise learning should have three-dimensions, namely “about” (useful and
relevant information about enterprise), “for” (equip them for enterprise by developing
practical skills) and “through” (provide them with a conductive learning environment
through which they engage with real enterprise activity). However, it became clear at
the outset that in these engineering modules there was a need to enhance or extend
existing provision which led to the proposition that a fourth dimension might be added
to the criteria of module design. We term this “enterprise from discipline” to indicate
that the learning needs to begin from where the student is and in the context of the
student’s chosen subject.
The WRCE approach to the task of embedding enterprise encouraged staff and
departments to introduce elements of enterprise into existing modules as well as to
development new enterprise modules. The view was that by such an approach a large
number of students could be reached and that in some cases, student learning could be
cumulative and reinforcing by enterprise tracks in courses.
The paragraph above refers to elements of enterprise and needs some clarification.
If we are to count enterprise modules we need to know what to count? What are the
criteria that need to be met? Enterprise courses (like other courses) should seek to
provide knowledge/skills/competencies. Enterprise courses should seek to enable the
student to think as an entrepreneur (just as a chemistry course seeks to have its
graduates thinking as chemists) and enterprise modules within science or engineering
courses need at least to make the student think about their subject in an enterprising
way.
For a WRCE module, there are four key criteria that challenge the way the module is
taught and how the students learn. These criteria are:
(1) make things happen;
(2) have commercial ideas;
(3) do something about them; and
(4) take advantage of opportunities to bring about change.
Additionally, there are eight key elements that affect the module content:
(1) innovation;
(2) strategy and business planning;
(3) marketing;
(4) intellectual property;
(5) human resource management (including leadership and teamwork);
(6) creativity;

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded by Temple University At 16:08 24 July 2015 (PT)

(7) finance; and
(8) communication skills.
Fully developed modules were expected to be the exception. On the other hand,
departmental teaching staff were encouraged to introduce a sufficient number of
“elements” to ensure that students were able to obtain some enterprise understanding
and at least begin to develop an enterprise mindset.
The WRCE team encouraged wider implementation of the embedded approach
(developed from student feedback and teacher conversations) by suggesting that
students liked and valued learning enterprise skills, that there was student enthusiasm
and demand, that academic colleagues who had begun the process found it enhanced
rather than detracted from core subject learning and that it enabled a more
participative rather than directed teaching approach that spread to other modules’.
Overall, the embedding proposition of the SEC and its implementation by WRCE
may be characterised, broadly, as follows:
P1.

Prioritise introducing some aspects of enterprise into existing modules rather
than developing and offering full enterprise modules.

P2.

Develop an enterprise track such that students (through core or elective
modules) can develop their interest, knowledge and skills continuously and so
that they see enterprise as an important theme in their study rather than say a
final year option to assist with career decisions.

P3.

Seek to have enterprise modules (both existing modules with added enterprise
and new modules) taught by departmental staff rather than by service
teaching from Business School or central unit.

P4.

Seek to provide the students with information, skills and “enterprise
experiences”, and do this in a way that connects to the core subject.

To what extent has this proposition been effected and, if there has been achievement,
how has it been achieved?
Observational outcomes
It is possible to group the responses to the WRCE initiative in three general
categories. These general categories were evident across the White Rose Universities
though the examples below are selected, for coherence, from Sheffield, one of the
three universities.
First, there was a response centred on a department’s perceived need to increase its
student intake by attempting to offer something that attracted a difference segment of the
market. Such a response often led to the development of new courses (x with enterprise,
where x was the main departmental subject – or in the case of chemistry more exactly, x
with enterprise management). Examples include biomedical science with enterprise,
physics with enterprise management, and chemistry with enterprise management. With
“enterprise” identified as a second subject for a joint degree provision from the business
school became the inevitable choice. Teaching of enterprise was external to the
department and there was little effect upon the departmental staff (who continued to teach
their own subject and on students who chose that subject and not the joint courses.

620

Evidence to date is that these courses are poorly subscribed compared with the
mainstream science subjects.
The second category was the response from enthusiastic teachers. The major
response to the offer by WRCE for cash to develop new modules was from individual
members of staff who recognized the need and opportunity to develop their material.
Often, this was motivated by the desire to provide modules that were more relevant
and responsive to the needs of students to get jobs. Supporting enthusiasts proved to
be a rapid means of creating activity and new, enterprise learning material. It enabled
grant targets of “science and engineering students receiving enterprise education” to be
met and introduced the words “enterprise” and “enterprise modules” into coffee room
conversations in a wide number of departments. The modules developed were often
developments of existing modules and not full and coherent modules (as might have
been developed by enterprise experts, such as the Entrepreneurial Template proposed
by Gibb (2006). They also had names such as:
[. . .] group project in physics or “information management in the digital economy” though
there are some more clearly labeled physics in an enterprise culture for example. Modules that
do not include the word “enterprise” can tend to be omitted in national mapping of enterprise
modules. Nevertheless, introducing change into organizations through the desired,
professional development of its staff – a seep rather than sweep strategy – may well be a
significant and effective strategy (Kothari and Handscombe, 2007).

The third category was a departmental response and the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Sheffield in the UK was one of the first departments at
the White Rose Universities to embedded enterprise. The department was motivated
by its desire to respond to external criticism during an accreditation visit and internal
criticism from its students of its provision of engineering management provision. The
desire to align with the aspirations of the professional body, the Engineering Council,
corresponded with the availability of funding support within the SEC grant, and so
there was the opportunity to make a distinctive change in provision. A new Level
1 module, called “Enterprise and Technology” was developed by commissioning some
relevant research and the services of an external expert. In addition, a technology
start-up case study was written, based on invention from the research base of the
department (Cross et al., 2004). There was the opportunity to recruit new staff and a
young, lively engineer with an MBA was recruited as a project officer in 2002 and
given a permanent role in the department in 2004. Finally, and in parallel with the
initiatives funded by the SEC grant, an existing associate with industry experience and
who had been providing inputs in design and technology audits was brought more into
the main stream of teaching. The objective was an enterprise track within the
engineering degree and new modules have been created and new assessment processes
introduced. Early market research (with students, employers and others) indicated a
distaste for the word “enterprise” whilst an embrace of the learning material and
approaches. As a consequence, the emphasis on the word “enterprise” is minimized in
the four modules developed “Enterprise and Technology”; “Business Skills for
Engineers”; “Innovation and Management”, and “Technology Strategy and Business
Planning” (one at each level of the four-year MEng course).
The approach in this third category depended on the enthusiasm of individual staff
but sought to set that enthusiasm in the context of an overall departmental vision. The
starting point for such an approach lies with the department leadership and there

<-----Page 8----->Downloaded by Temple University At 16:08 24 July 2015 (PT)

appear to be a number of relevant success factors of which four critical ones are
discussed here. First, the head of department needs to aware of the opportunities and to
have confidence in the source of the new initiative and its advocate. The latter is crucial
not just initially for the advocate to receive a hearing but also on a larger scale if the
head of department is to initiate the change in departmental culture implied by the
embedding approach. Second, the awareness and confidence of the departmental
leadership has to coincide with a need. Matching against a need is important in order to
raise the initiative sufficiently high on the priority list that it will receive attention from
the leadership and professors of the department. Third, resources need to be available
and external resources always help in stimulating change although McMullan and
Long (1987) have highlighted that this approach can be difficult to sustain. In this case,
resources from SEC provided the activation energy for the department to begin
embedding enterprise in its curriculum. The maintenance of the curriculum is
significantly less expensive than making major changes and since the changes were
embedded their delivery were progressively absorbed into the recurring cost of
teaching the mechanical engineering degree programme. Fourth and no less important
than the preceding factors, was the appointment of an “entrepreneur-in-residence”,
i.e. an individual who was an engineering graduate with an MBA who had worked in
small businesses, in other words an individual who could teach “enterprise from” a
clear and relevant perspective. This appointment was initially fully funded by WRCE,
then 50:50 by WRCE and the department, and then in 2004 the department took on the
entire commitment. The embedding of this individual into the department had the
advantage of allowing continuous development of the programme and provided a
resource for other teaching staff who also introduced elements of enterprise into their
teaching.
The importance of continuous development can be outlined from the example of the
fourth year capstone project, entitled “Technology strategy and business planning”.
The students work in teams to find solutions to a real problem provided by a real
customer. The challenge is for the student teams to identify a technical solution to the
customer problem and then develop a business proposition from this. Teams pitch
their ideas to an invited audience and defend their poster presentation of their business
idea to judges from a mixed background (technical, commercial and legal). Prizes are
awarded to the best presentations.
The objective of the module is to give the student an opportunity to try to solve a
real problem by combining their engineering knowledge with the commercial
constraints that would need to be met in making a business success of their technical
solution. It is also an opportunity for students to develop their presentational skills –
oral and graphic (poster).
Feedback is an integral part of the module; informing both the performance of
the students throughout the module in the form of a mentorship scheme and the
performance of the module itself. Each year the module leader critically reviews the
feedback provided by the students, every contributor involved in the module, her own
observations and current developments in enterprise learning taking place at that time.
Based on this knowledge she asks herself “what do I need to change to make next year
better?” An essential aspect of this reflective activity is ensuring that only what needs
to be enhanced is enhanced and to not change what works.

Through the years, the focus of the module has moved from the exploitation of
university research (no “real” dimension, low-technical involvement from students, too
much stress on business venturing, virtually no emotional engagement from students)
through working with external companies with real problems predominantly in the
area of product development (“real” dimension, more technical involvement, still high
emphasis on business venturing and again, no emotional attachment from students) to
working directly with disadvantaged individuals with specific needs that can be
improved by engineering and enterprise solutions (truly real dimension, high-technical
involvement, meaningful engagement on business venturing and an astonishing
emotional commitment from students).
This “social enterprise” approach has proven to be the most successful in terms of
commitment both from the students and the external contributors. It has also
unearthed new opportunities including; working with both local hospitals and
hospices, volunteering work by students (social responsibility impact) and more
engagement of research-orientated professors in this area.
Conclusions
To what extent do the findings at Sheffield match up to the broad characterisation of
WRCE embedded approach? The four characteristics are repeated with commentary:
(1) Prioritise introducing some aspects of enterprise into existing modules rather
than developing and offering full enterprise modules.
There is evidence of modification of existing modules though the greatest
success appears to be in Mechanical Engineering, where new enterprise
modules have been carefully designed and developed.
(2) Develop an enterprise track such that students (through core or elective
modules) can develop their interest, knowledge and skills continuously and so
that they see enterprise as an important theme in their study rather than say a
final year option to assist with career decisions.
In Mechanical Engineering, a successful track has been introduced, generally
to very positive acclaim by students (and crucially the external professional
bodies) but a key feature of this has been the embedding of enterprise in a
broader management and design track rather than a stand alone enterprise
track. In science, there are new degrees or isolated modules or part modules but
no clear evidence of enterprise tracks.
(3) Seek to have enterprise modules (both existing modules with added enterprise
and new modules) taught by departmental staff rather than by service teaching
from Business School or central unit.
Examples exist across the science and engineering faculties of partial
enterprise modules taught by existing departmental staff. The “science with
enterprise” degrees are largely taught by Business School staff. In Mechanical
Engineering, the teaching of the enterprise modules is carried out from within
the departmental teaching resource and specifically from within the Design,
Manufacturing and Management Group. It should be noted that the leader of
that group is a teaching fellow (successful business person rather than
academic by background and originally appointed for departmental knowledge
partnership activities), the key enterprise teacher was a new appointment

<-----Page 10----->Downloaded by Temple University At 16:08 24 July 2015 (PT)

specifically for the task and that the person now teaching the Level 2 module is
hired on an external contract. The success appears to reside in leadership from
within and does not need staff from the business school but there is no evidence
here that existing departmental academic staff have embedded enterprise in
their modules.
(4) Seek to provide the students with information, skills and “enterprise
experiences” and do this in a way that connects to the core subject.
There is broad evidence that the design of enterprise modules involved a
careful blend of information, skill development and enterprise experience. The
module leaders for the Levels 2 and 4 modules in Mechanical Engineering
(co-authors of this paper) would identify “technological venturing” (i.e.
challenging the student to solve technical problems in a business environment
and, or to identify technical opportunities for business) to be more important in
obtaining student interest and hence, student learning, than business venturing
(i.e. challenging the students to solve a business problem or come up with a
business plan). Both have student feedback that indicates a kindling of business
venturing interest as a consequence of involvement in “technological
venturing”. Additionally, the reflection of instructors involved with the
enterprise teaching in Mechanical Engineering is that it is not simply what you
do, but the way that you do it, the impact on society and that pedagogic
approaches are perhaps more critical than content.
In summary, the findings do not map very closely with the first three characteristics of
the WRCE approach and encourage a closer and more rigorous evaluation, perhaps
across all three universities. There is very positive mapping of the final characteristic.
The importance of trying to connect with the core subject appears crucial and seems
to provide a module/course equivalence of the findings (Lucas et al., 2006) that for
placements; relatively high-student learning is achieved in properly managed
placements that are close in content to the student’s field of study.
As a general conclusion, we would say that enterprise learning helps develop
student confidence and self-efficacy and that a possible outcome of this is their
willingness to take control of their careers and an increased willingness to consider
setting up and running their own companies. It additionally means that they have, on
graduation, attitudes and skill that enable them to differentiate themselves in a
crowded graduate market place.
Future research
There is an opportunity to map enterprise activity more rigorously and quantitatively
and to seek to interpret aspects of institutional changes (in attitude and substance) that
can be related to the implementation of the SEC award. There is also opportunity to
assess student learning and perhaps specifically changes in technology venturing
self-efficacy as a consequence of enterprise modules. The discussion and conclusions
here are partial and qualitative, though in defence, they are the observations of three
separate individuals who were all closely involved with the SEC programme and
provided from three separate perspectives. The above conclusions are largely
qualitative and the findings interpreted through the lens of those individuals closely
involved. In part, the authors’ understanding of the value and outcomes of enterprise

teaching is based on the feedback received from students and it is recognized that
enthusiastic teachers can take particular notice of loud and enthusiastic students and
whose motivation (“thanks Bob, it made a pleasant chance from maths”) needs careful
evaluation.
