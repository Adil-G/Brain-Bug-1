ABSTRACT. This paper reports an empirical study of Canadian informal “angel” investors. A key contribution is the development of a portrait of the decision making of these angels as well as a framework
which was successful in structuring this decision making. Angels are well educated and experienced as
investors. They tend to hold other full time jobs. They invest in new growth-oriented businesses, usually at the earliest stages of business development. They report a shortage of investment-ready businesses
in which the principals are willing to partner with experienced investor-mentors. Investors learn about
opportunities mostly from business associates. Evaluation tends to be informal, although some investors
have extensive sets of due diligence materials. The key dimensions of investable business opportunities
are the market potential of the business, the capability of the principals to commercialize the service or
product, and the opportunity for investors to make substantive non-financial contributions to the firm.
SOMMAIRE. Cet article présente les résultats d’une étude empirique portant sur les investisseurs providentiels canadiens. Une contribution importante est le développement d’un bilan de la prise de décision des investisseurs providentiels ainsi qu’un cadre de référence permettant une bonne organisation
de cette prise de décision. Les investisseurs providentiels possèdent une solide formation et de l’expérience à titre d’investisseurs. Ils ont généralement un autre emploi à temps plein. Ils investissent dans
des entreprises en démarrage orientées vers la croissance, habituellement dans les premières phases de
leur développement. Ils constatent également un manque d’entreprises où les dirigeants sont prêts à
s’associer avec un financier d’expérience. Les investisseurs apprennent l’existence de la plupart des
occasions d’affaires par leurs partenaires d’affaires. L’évaluation est davantage informelle, quoique certains investisseurs possèdent une panoplie d’outils pour la vérification diligente. Les facteurs principaux
d’un investissement fortement considéré sont le marché potentiel pour l’entreprise, la capacité des
dirigeants de commercialiser les produits ou services et la possibilité pour l’investisseur de contribuer
substantiellement d’une manière autre que financière à l’entreprise.

Introduction
Small firms play an important role in job creation and economic welfare.
These enterprises require access to both loan and equity capital for this employment growth to occur. The primary sources of equity capital for growing small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are friends and relatives (“love money”) and
informal investors (sometimes referred to as “angels” or “private investors”).
Angels are active and important in equity financing between the stages of owners’
initial financing (personal financing and “love money”) and institutional venture
capital or public financing. The purpose of this paper is to report on an empirical
study of Canadian informal investors. The specific goals of this study were to:

1. update profiles for typical individual investors,
2. describe the nature of the informal investment process, and
3. identify key parameters of the investment process.
Background
The expansion capital provided by private investors is essential for many growing businesses. Moreover, this employment growth and its importance to governments as a source of tax revenues is substantial. Historically in Canada, the relative
contribution to job creation by small firms has varied. Table 1 lists the relative contribution, by size of business enterprise, to net private sector paid employment
change over the 1994–2000 period.1

According to Industry Canada (http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/pics/rd/table3.pdf),
2.4% of Canadian SMEs sought equity financing of some type during 2000. The
most frequently-sought forms of equity financing were from Crown Corporations
(43.3% of requests), banks and credit unions (15.6% of requests), friends and relatives (12.3% of requests) and business angels (9.7% of requests). Angel financing
was the single most frequently sought form of equity for knowledge-based firms
(25.9% of requests) and of particular importance to exporters (17.7% of exporter
firms sought angel capital compared with 7.8% of non-exporter firms). Firms located in urban areas were much more likely to seek angel financing (14.5% of urban
firms) than firms located in rural settings (2.4% of rural firms).
Industry Canada data (http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/rd00673e.html;
12/18/2002) also indicates that in 2001 the contribution to job creation shifted
from large and medium-sized firms to firms with fewer than 100 employees. This is
noteworthy because this arguably reflects informal investment made in businesses
during the year 2000, the year covered by the data in this study.
An important part of the market for informal capital investment in SMEs in
Canada was the creation of the Canadian Community Investment Program (CCIP)

in 1995 (Industry Canada, 2001). Twenty-two pilot sites were created across Canada
with a five-year mandate to work with early stage firms to help the firms become
investment ready, to introduce investment-ready firms to angel investors (and
venture capitalists if the firm was thought to be ready for such investment), and to
work with the investors and entrepreneurs to help with post-investment expansion
and viability. This experiment ran from 1995 to 2001 and was financed by Industry
Canada. The program received strong, positive evaluations. However, the experiment is now over. The CCIP experiment left a legacy of economic developers with
a strong sense of angel needs and identities. The motivation for this work is to study
whether the needs of informal investors have changed, to understand better the current nature of the informal investment process in Canada, and to inquire what next
steps could facilitate the informal investment market in Canada. To achieve this, it
is necessary to understand the current status of the investment process in Canada.
To accomplish the objectives stated above, this paper is organized as follows.
First, previous research is discussed, followed by a statement of specific research
goals and objectives. This is followed by a description of methodology and research
findings. The paper concludes with a summary and conclusions section.
Previous Research
There has been an evolution of research on the informal capital market. Prior
to 1980 this market was unknown to academics and public policy makers. During
the decade of the 1980s initial research results began to establish the existence and
importance of this market. During the 1990s further research led to more in-depth
understanding of investment preferences and criteria. Recent research has yielded
a yet better understanding of the role of informal investors in helping to enhance
the value of the firms in which their investments are made. At the same time, there
appears to have been an evolution in the informal market itself. While little is
known about the operation of this market prior to 1980, this market was seen as
fragmented and regional during the 1980s. Matching programs were first established in the early and mid-1980s as a means of reducing this fragmentation. A proliferation of matching programs occurred during the early 1990s. Throughout
these periods, angel syndication became more common and increasingly formalized. Informal investor syndicates in the 1990s were generally thought to be fluid
and informal. Recent years have seen a proliferation of angel groups, now more
structured and formal than before, and (in the US) the start of angel “side-funds.”
Investor Profiles
Wetzel (1983) carried out the seminal research on the informal investment
market for risk capital. He documented demographic attributes of New Hampshire
private investors and provided evidence that informal risk capital investors may
represent one of the largest pools of risk capital in the United States. Wetzel and
Freear (1986) provided further evidence that angels are the primary source of
equity capital to new technology-based firms in the United States. Mason and
Harrison (1990, 1991, 1995) have documented the importance of informal
investors to capital formation for early stage firms in the United Kingdom. In
Canada, previous work by Riding and his associates (Feeney, Riding and Haines,
1999; Duxbury, Riding and Haines, 1996; Watson, Riding and Haines, 1998;
Riding, Duxbury and Haines, 1997; Duxbury, Riding and Haines, l994; and DalCin,

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

Duxbury, Haines, and Riding 1994) and Farrell (1998) has established basic knowledge about Canadian angels.
Demographic profiles of informal investors in the United States have been
reported by Gaston and Bell (1986), Wetzel (1983), Haar, Starr, and Macmillan
(1988), and Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000). Common themes emerge
from these profiles. Investors are well educated, wealthy individuals who have typically had experience in start-up of new business ventures. Investors prefer to invest
close to home and sometimes to syndicate with other informal investors. On average, they anticipate holding a given investment for five to eight years and expect to
realize a capital gain on exit that provides the equivalent of an after-tax annualized
rate of return of 30 to 40%. Recent work has found that informal investors bring
far more to the firms in which they invest than merely money. Their non-financial
contributions help prepare firms for growth and for further investment by venture
capital firms (Lindstrom and Olofsson, 2001; Haines, Madill, and Riding, 2002).
The Informal Investment Process
A framework describing the process that informal investors are hypothesized to
use in arriving at their investment decisions was developed to guide this study (see
Figure 1). This model reflects the seminal work of Tybjee and Bruno (1984) and a
generic eight-stage investment process advanced more recently by Van Osnabrugge
and Robinson (2000, p. 116). The staging framework presented in Figure 1 combines these models to reflect three sub-stages of the latter model (investment motivations, investment criteria, and finding deals) that are apparently subsumed within Tybjee and Bruno’s “deal origination” stage. In addition, the model used here
incorporates Van Osnabrugge and Robinson’s suggestion of an initial screening
stage.

Figure 1. The Informal Investment Process

The works of Tybjee and Bruno and Van Osnabrugge and Robinson are important contributions among several archetypes of the process by which managers of
institutional venture capital firms are thought to make investment decisions.
Figure 2 (Nitani 2002) presents a graphical comparison of the elements of the
most frequently cited models. However, venture capital fund managers and private
investors differ in at least one important respect. Venture capital fund managers
are paid employees, agents of the funds’ sponsors. Informal investors invest their
personal funds and are therefore principals as opposed to agents. This fundamental agency theoretic difference would suggest that angels and fund managers may
differ in decision-making process and criteria. However, there has been very little
research on the decision-making process and criteria employed by angels particularly in the Canadian context. Two exceptions are Riding, Duxbury and Haines
(1997) and Feeney, Riding and Haines (1999). Both of these papers are suggestive

that the informal investor decision process is similar, but the criteria, particularly
for rejections, differ. However, neither of these studies examined in detail all of the
stages of the decision process. This paper uses focus group data to inform further
both the process and criteria utilized by Canadian informal investors.
Specific Research Goals and Objectives
There are three specific research objectives for the paper. First, to update, from
empirical data, profiles for typical individual investors. Profiles include breakdowns
of investors’ personal characteristics (education, experience, financial attributes,
and occupation); investors’ expectations and investment patterns (investment size,
sector, stage, frequency of investments, location of businesses); and investors’ experiences regarding the availability of investment opportunities. Second, to describe
the nature of the informal investment process following from Figure 1, starting
with deal origination, and concluding with how investors expect to exit from their
investments. Third, to identify key parameters of the investment process, including: essential factors prompting investors to make an investment; investors’ experience, and investors’ perceptions of level of preparedness of small and medium
size enterprises (SMEs) with respect to private investment.
Methodology
Eleven focus group interviews with informal investors and other individuals
involved in financing new enterprises were held across Canada during the winter
and spring of 2001. A summary of the focus group protocol is provided in the
Appendix. These focus groups were conducted with the cooperation of the CCIP
sites in Mt. Pearl Newfoundland (5 participants), Halifax Nova Scotia (10 participants), Moncton New Brunswick (3 participants), Fredericton New Brunswick (9
participants); Ste. Hyacinthe Quebec (3 participants), Ste. Therese Quebec (9 participants), Waterloo Ontario (9 participants), Niagara Ontario (5 participants),
London Ontario (6 participants), Canmore Alberta (6 participants), Victoria

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

British Columbia (6 participants). The participants were selected by the managers
of the eleven CCIP sites; the managers were asked to invite individuals that were
known to be active angels. In addition to 51 informal investors, twenty other individuals involved in financing new enterprises were included in these focus groups.
These other individuals included, for example, representatives from institutional
venture capital firms as well as representatives from local agencies and banks.
Participants were asked to complete a short questionnaire (available from the
authors on request) designed to provide baseline data, in addition to taking part
in the focus group interview. The focus groups conducted in Quebec were conducted in French, all others were conducted in English.
As is standard focus group procedure (Morgan and Krueger 1998), participants
were asked to respond in their own words with no prompting nor with any predetermined categories provided by the researchers. These focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and the resulting qualitative data were analyzed using
NUD*IST (Qualitative Solutions and Research Proprietary, Ltd., 1997), a technique specifically designed for rigorous exploration and analysis of qualitative data.
At this point, the data were coded to determine whether the categories suggested
by the model could be found in the data. As part of the NUD*IST analysis each relevant quotation is treated as a piece of data and stored in a tree structure. The
resulting tree structure allows the researcher to examine patterns and relationships
among the qualitative data and across categories of respondents. The tree structure
also allows for cross referencing of these patterns and relationships. The result is a
structured organization of what heretofore was unstructured qualitative data. The
approach also allows for the identification of categories based on the words and
statements of the respondents and therefore goes beyond reliance on the
researchers’ preconceived expectations. This tool further allows selection of representative pieces of data to be easily included as evidence in the sections that follow.
Research Findings
Profile of Participants
The participant profiles, which focus on the demographic data on informal
investors, are drawn from the questionnaires completed as a supplement to the
focus group interviews.
The 51 investor participants had been involved in 142 deals during the preceding two years, collectively investing more than $107 million in these investments.
The average stake invested per angel of about $750,000 per investment was almost
exactly the figure that one would get if the figure of $632,000 reported in Riding,
Dal Cin, Duxbury, Haines, and Safrata (1993, p. 40) is scaled up using CPI excluding food (CANSIM Series P100284). This suggests the average stake invested per
Canadian angel has been relatively stable in real terms over the last decade.
The investor respondents were well educated, with more than 44% of respondents reporting a post-graduate degree and another 24% an undergraduate university degree. Forty-five percent of investors held professional designations, most
frequently accountants and professional engineers. Investments tended to be local,
with 68% of the deals being located within 50 km of the investors’ home or office.
Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the responses from the question where
investors were asked to identify their full-time occupation. Some respondents

reported more than one full-time occupation. The vast majority of investor respondents held other jobs; hence, investing and managing their investments was not
their primary occupation. This observation implies the amount of time informal
investors can accord due diligence, post-investment management, and other
aspects of private investment may have severe limitations. This further implies that
informal investors might wish to rely on syndicates as a way of dealing with this time
limitation. Almost all respondents (91%) were currently business owners or had
been business owners at some point in their lives.
The investor participants tended to be experienced investors, representing an
average of 11.6 years of informal investment experience. As shown in Chart 2,
Canadian angels tend to be repeat investors in the informal marketplace, with
more than 70% of respondents reporting at least one investment every two or three
years and with one-third of respondents investing several times annually.
The frequency of investments is not too different from results reported by
DalCin, Haines and Riding (1994, p. 3):
The informal investors surveyed for this study report having made an
average of 4.2 investments within Canada and 0.6 foreign investments for
a total stake that averages $632,000 per investor (an average of $126,000
per year per investor) over the 1968–1991 period.

the most frequent investments, the average size of such deals tended to be small.
Of the 142 deals, 60 (42%) were to businesses described as being in knowledgebased enterprises. Deals in the finance and real estate sector accounted for a disproportionate amount of the capital invested. Most investors reported deals in multiple sectors. Also, as has been found in previous research, investments were predominantly placed in early stages, usually at the seed and start-up stages. As shown
in Chart 4, below, more than 60% of investors had invested at the start-up stage and
50% of investors responded that they had invested at the seed stage of projects.
The Informal Investment Process
The data on the investment process is drawn almost completely from the focus
group interviews. It is of interest to note that most investors expected that there
would be regional differences in investor activity. Questionnaire responses were
used to assess differences by major geographic region (Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario,
and the West), as to investor experience, education, capital availability, investment
frequency, stage and sector of investment, expectations, proposals reviewed, perceptions as to deal flow and use of syndicates. Based on a series of one-way ANOVAs,
no statistically significant (Type 1 error of 5%) regional differences existed.
The major hypothesis guiding this study states that the framework in Figure 1 is
a useful and faithful description of informal investors decision processes.
Therefore, the order in which the material is presented follows the sequence given
in the framework in Figure 1. This section begins with a discussion of the findings
of the three components of deal origination.
Deal Origination
Investment Motivations and Investment Criteria. By virtue of the focus group
methodology, 51 investor participants were individuals who were already motivated

<-----Page 9----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 22

22

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

to invest. Collectively, these investors reported having a total of more than $47 million available “for the purpose of making private investments in Canadian SMEs,”
an average of slightly less than $1 million each.
In addition to the 51 already-active investors, five of the focus group participants were individuals who were interested in becoming angel investors. In each
case, these individuals were recently cashed-out entrepreneurs who had already
established and developed a successful business. These nascent investors came to
the focus groups sessions to network with existing investors and to learn about the
investment process. What was apparent was that both the investors’ and nascent
investors’ motivations went far beyond purely financial intentions. Investors were
virtually unanimous that they wanted to make substantial non-financial contributions to the firms in which they invested and to be a part of the development of the
new businesses. This is witnessed by the following verbatim comments from focus
group participants.
“… an investment criteria for me is to be able to determine what value I
can add and if I see no value that I can add to an investment then I tend
to walk away.”
“Whether it is a network of contacts and the leverage that comes from
that or personal skill and ability that can be applied to a situation, the
whole aspect of value added is absolutely necessary to move those things
forward.”
“A lot of times you become a mentor to the individual because they don’t
have the business experience, that is why they came to you in the first
place.”
“In an investing company, I always take a board position and insist that
proper board governance be put into place. I insist on the development
of a board of directors as a breadth of ability and experience in governance … to hold management’s feet to the fire constantly.”
“I’m in a deal with somebody now and he’s got a business in Bangkok and
he’s limited to the Asian circle just because of his experience but now he’s
got somebody in North America and I’ve got European roots as well so
I’m able to help him expand that way where he may not have been able
to without me.”
“… we do a whole service and we can actually … help build the business
plan and raise the capital and bring in managers who do the operating.”

The qualitative data show that investment criteria are a mixture that arises out
of the motivations for making informal investments as well as the goals associated
with informal investments that are applied when due diligence occurs. This implies
that the key investment criteria are to find small businesses with capacity for growth
that can supply significant returns on investment (see Exit Strategies section) when
the investor contributes his or her expertise that is currently missing in the small
business in its current form.
Finding deals. The primary means by which investors learn about potential
investment opportunities is through referrals from business associates. A majority
of participants in the focus groups in all parts of the country mentioned that professional contacts—including accountants, bankers, lawyers and other investors—

<-----Page 10----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 23

INFORMAL INVESTMENT IN CANADA

23

are key sources for introductions to potential investments. This confirms the findings reported in Dal Cin, Haines and Riding (1994, p.6). Investors in each discussion group also count the local CCIP site as an important source of potential investment opportunities. Many investors also note that investment opportunities found
the investor—the individuals become known in the community as potential
investors. Potential investors are approached often with a wide range of investment
opportunities (however, as will be seen later, few opportunities are well prepared
for investment).
It is interesting to compare the Canadian practice with data reported from the
United States and the United Kingdom. Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000, pp.
77–84) list and describe ten ways, including professional networks, for businesses
seeking informal investors in the United States to find potential investors, but present no data on how commonly each of these ten ways are used. Recent, albeit anecdotal, evidence from the US indicates that the US market for informal capital is
changing to a more formal structure (de Noble, 2001, p. 362) with the establishment of formal angel groupings and angel side funds. In the UK, Mason and
Harrison (1996, p. 107) studied LINC (Local Investment Networking Company), a
well-established business introduction service in the United Kingdom, and found
it was a source for deal flow. However, a somewhat similar service in Canada known
as COIN (Canadian Opportunities Investment Network) failed for lack of informal
investor and business interest (Riding and Blatt, 1992). Moreover, Canadian securities legislation is relatively more of a constraint with respect to both establishing
investor syndicates and providing investment recommendations.
Initial screening. In the supplementary questionnaires, the investors reported
“reviewing,” collectively, approximately 1,200 proposals per year (on average, about
24 proposals per year each). As noted above, 142 deals were accepted during the
previous two years. This results in an estimated acceptance rate of approximately
6%. This acceptance rate is higher than the approximately 2.5–3% reported in Dal
Cin, Duxbury, Haines and Riding (1994, pp. 124–126) and by Watson, Haines and
Riding (1998, p. 3). However, the qualitative focus group data suggest that most
investors are exposed to considerably more projects than 24 proposals per year per
participant. Participants frequently commented that many potential deals are not
pursued beyond very preliminary discussions and that such deals may not have been
reported among the 24 proposals per year reported as having been considered.
The quantitative data from the questionnaires also showed that investors were
split on the issue of whether or not they experienced a sufficient deal flow: 55% of
respondents reported that they have a sufficient deal flow; 45% reported to the
contrary. Dal Cin, Haines and Riding (1995) report that 61% of investors stated
that investment opportunities were scarce. The figure of 45% in this study compared with the figure of 61% in the earlier study suggests that respondents in the
present study have a more satisfactory deal flow than participants in the earlier
study. This may reflect that focus group participants were selected by CCIP site
managers and the higher deal flow may reflect the activities of the CCIP sites.
However, in interpreting this response, it is worth noting that investors may also
define the term “deal flow” differently from each other. It is likely that some
investor respondents interpreted this question to pertain to all deals, while others
may have restricted their response to what they perceive as viable deals. (“Nous
avons peu de projets bien montés.”)

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

Investors were consistent in their views that entrepreneurs and small business
owners who are seeking investment are frequently not well prepared to attract private investment. From the private investor viewpoint, there are a number of common ways in which potential entrepreneurs and small business owners are not well
prepared. These include business plans not well developed, expectations that large
investments from outside investors would occur with little “interference” from
those outside investors, unwillingness to relinquish control, poorly developed ideas
about markets and revenue streams, and an inability to recognize the need to
acquire the multitude of skills needed to develop their businesses. Quotes that
illustrate these investor views include:
“In my experience, about 95% are not at a stage where they can properly
use financing. The business plans are not well thought through and often
there is no pragmatism for the approach… There is a lack of entrepreneurial culture, which means that people who have an idea … give very
little thought towards growing the business. Once they have the idea they
move to asking, ‘Now where’s my money for my business?’ They give very
little thought towards business planning or cash flow—it’s a very high percentage that are not ready for cash, but are ready for assistance.”
“Il y a un manque de vision à long-terme puisqu’on peut toujours se
réadapter.”
“Manque de préparation dans les plans d’affaires.”
“… a lot of times they have a great idea, but have no idea about how the
cash is going to come in. I can think of cases where my first question is
‘How is this idea going to pay your bills?’ They say, ‘Well, I don’t know’. I
say, ‘Well it’s a great hobby then’. It’s not a business until they can answer
some of these questions.”
“I have certain red flags: … I have identified similar patterns repeating in
people’s lives. Therefore I look for a pattern because I expect to see it
emerge again in the venture contemplated. For example, failed relationships with close business associates most always repeat.”
“I think the biggest challenge is the recognition that the entrepreneur
does not have the necessary skill set to be successful… they are probably
really good at one item like developing software or whatever, but they are
lousy at marketing or management. Our biggest problem is do they recognize that and get the help they need—sometimes it takes a long time to
convince them…”

Overall, these shortcomings can be characterized as the inability of most potential entrepreneurs to manage the commercialization process, and inappropriate
views by entrepreneurs (in the opinion of the investors) regarding the value of the
firm as a whole and, within the firm, the value of an idea compared to the overall
value of a business. Most investors note that potential entrepreneurs overvalue the
idea and undervalue the contributions (both financial and non-financial) that are
required to grow and develop a business.
Due Diligence
Private investors consistently mention that they are looking for investment
opportunities (a) with the right people, (b) with market potential, and (c) where

they can add significant value. These three factors were mentioned as key in every
focus group. These factors were also identified by Watson, Haines, and Riding
(1998) as key reasons for deciding to invest in an opportunity. While there is strong
agreement on these points, there is a wide variety of approaches that Canadian
investors use in evaluating potential investments.
At one extreme, most investors indicated that their due diligence process is fairly informal. These investors report that they go over the financial statements and
projections that are available about the potential opportunity, they meet with the
principals and get to know them over a period of time, and they conduct informal
reference checks on the track records of the principals. Many investors using these
informal approaches indicate that they use a “gut feel” and have to feel that they
can trust the people involved in potential deals and would like to work with them.
Granovetter (1985) emphasized the importance of trust and personal relationships
in arriving at this type of economic decision.
At the other extreme, a smaller number of investors (these tended to be largerscale investors) indicated that their due diligence process is very sophisticated.
These investors report that they use checklists, hire assistants to examine all documentation and search out other evidence about the principals seeking investment. This importance of the people involved is best expressed by the investors
themselves:
“I invest in jockeys not horses. Good jockeys will ride good horses.”
“For me, I only want to invest in entrepreneurs who are going to maintain
control of their company. I’m investing in the person; I want them making the decisions.”
“Il faut tenir compte autant de la capacité de l’entreprise dans son produit, dans la capacité de gérer et aussi de mettre en marché le produit.”
“I didn’t always feel this way, but there’s only one thing that makes the
world go round and that’s who are sitting around this table—people, and
if you have people with the wrong expectations, then you are in trouble
to start with. If you can get the right kind of people with the right tools
that you want to work with, then that can make a whole lot of difference.”

Negotiation
The investors studied agreed that it is necessary to meet with the principals of
the firm in which they might invest and get to know them over a period of time.
While the establishment of a trust relation is essential, most investors require a
shareholder agreement. Most of the various aspects of the shareholders agreement
are, of course, negotiated to some extent. The details are beyond the scope of this
paper. For a summary of the typical attributes of shareholder agreements, see
MacLean (1995).
It is also essential to debate the value of the firm, and the relative value of the
respective contributions of the angel and the firm’s owners, and to reach agreement on these values. Thus, three aspects of the investment process dominate the
negotiation stage. The first relates to the current valuation of the business. The second aspect concerns the relative values of the founders’ business idea and innovations and the financial and non-financial contributions required to execute the

concept. The third aspect of negotiation is associated with establishing a mutually
agreeable exit strategy.
Current Valuation. Investors reported that one of the most frequent reasons for
not making particular investments was entrepreneurs’ unrealistic valuations. This
frequent point of disagreement in the negotiation process is witnessed by responses from the questionnaire that accompanied the focus groups. In the questionnaire, investors were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which nine
items inhibited investment. The two items rated the biggest inhibitors were entrepreneurs’ unrealistic valuations and unrealistic expectations (see Chart 5).
These ratings are echoed in the following statements of investors:
“I have seen opportunities where 30% of the company was represented by
$300,000 or $400,000 and 70% was represented by less than $1,000 and
they wanted to look at raising more money.”
“Souvent le promoteur aimerait avoir l’investissement en comptant, sans
avoir aucune autre forme de support ou de participation de l’investisseur.
Le promoteur a peur de perdre le contrôle de son entreprise.”

Relative values of contributions. In addition to the need to come to agreement
with respect to the overall value of the enterprise, it is also essential that the
founder(s) and investor(s) arrive at understandings about the values of their relative contributions. Typically, founders provide the original innovation and energy
about a potential product or services. Angel investors then provide the capital necessary (as well as substantive non-financial contributions) to take the innovation to
subsequent early stages (Haines, Madill, Riding, 2002). The relative values of these
respective contributions are difficult to measure. Moreover, they change over time.
As noted by the investors, these issues are often sticking points.
“What’s important to me is that the entrepreneur have an understanding
of the relative value of the contributions of the necessary cogs of the
wheel to make the idea work. If you work that way, you avoid some of the

<-----Page 14----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 27

problems of the absolutes in valuation and you just say my contribution as
the production manager is a 10% value of the ultimate success of this
business. Whether its 10% of 100 million or 200 million I don’t know and
some investment banker can tell us that in 3–4 years when we are about
to go public…but it’s that relative value.”
“There is a misunderstanding of the value of an idea compared to the
value of a business. We can sit around this table and generate good ideas
that would be quite executable, but it’s the execution and the preparedness to take risk with it that makes a difference. If you have management
that not only don’t see what their own limitations are, but at the same
time, they place the value of their idea at 95% of the enterprise value,
they are not willing to slice the equity value of the business in a way that
reflects the important contribution of those 4–5 components that are
needed for business to succeed—be it to attract the right talent or financing. Most entrepreneurs are unrealistic, are likely to overvalue the idea
and if they do that, they won’t get the talent or the equity that they need.”

Exit strategies. Angels’ investment decisions are often rooted in their exit
expectations.
“… they won’t go in unless they know how they’re going to get out.”
“Il faut se retirer quand nous sentons que notre investissement a aidé la
compagnie à fructifier. Il ne faut pas devenir le gestionnaire de l’entreprise.”
“I think the greatest fear is to be in an investment that is successful and
you’re not getting a return. … if you don’t put any controls in and you
don’t have a proper exit, and you don’t have the right to control management. [For example], what if we made a million dollars this year and
he took five hundred thousand bonus and you took five hundred thousand bonus. ‘We are really sorry, we can’t declare any dividends.’ And if
you can’t get out, they can do that to you forever. So that’s where you have
to be very cautious on that, how you get out, how do you protect yourself.
You can tie up management or you can be guaranteed a return, but
you’ve got to do something.”
“Si l’entreprise a des projets d’investissements et de développement de
nouveaux produits, ou que le promoteur a identifié des nouveaux
marchés,ces différents éléments pourraient justifier de maintenir notre
investissement à plus long-terme.”

Investors expect to obtain a 30 to 40% annualized rate of return, usually in the
form of capital gains, over a holding period of five to seven years (see Charts 6 and
7).
Investors recognized that it can take a long time before they realize their gains:
“We always have a big window to get out… you have to because, as the
business changes the relationship changes and certainly sometimes it had
been a long, slow, tedious buyout. [For example ] where … it’s a family
business you’ve invested in and you know you’re not going to become
part of the family and you want your money out, you know you can’t pull
it all out at once.”

Investors generally acknowledge the reality that most firms will not succeed.
They also understand that it will take from three to seven years before the firms in

which they invest will reach the stage where exit can be expected, and that entrepreneurs do not often anticipate investors’ need to exit.
“La plupart n’ont pas de stratégie fixe de retrait de l’entreprise.”
“Exits aren’t quick and anybody who looks at these things like it is a twoor three-year cycle I think that every now and then that happens, but I
don’t think it happens, not if you are doing this in an ongoing basis. You
end up living with the companies for a long period of time.”
“Tout projet a un cycle de vie. Il faut profiter du plateau de profit pour
se retirer. Mais il faut toutefois voir comment l’entreprise peut croître à
long-terme et dans certains cas il est avantageux de continuer sur une
plus longue période.”
“That’s the fun of being an angel investor—staying in and watching that
company grow.

For most investors, exit provisions are negotiated with business owners at the outset and are usually specified in the shareholder agreement. Several forms of exit
provision through mandatory transfers are common. These include a put option
provision (also described as a “retraction clause”), a call option provision, and an
agreement of purchase and sale usually predicated on predefined triggering events.
According to the put option approach, the investor maintains the legal right to
force the business owner to repurchase the investor’s shares at an agreed and prespecified price at particular points in time.
“We’ve used a model in a number of cases which have in effect treated the
money put in by the investors as … an equity position which has a retraction feature that after 2, 3, or 5 years is exercisable by the shareholder.
The theory is that it places the management of the company under the
discipline that if they’re not doing well then people do have a mechanism
by which they can vote with their wallet, and if enough people vote that
way then in fact you’ve voted to dissolve that company.”
“In one case it worked particularly well there were three, no there were
two retraction dates and about 10% of the shareholders retracted, so
there was a payout and it was for a dollar in two dollars out so you could
look to double your money. It provided that safety valve.”

This approach also has the advantage of adding a “discipline” on the business
owners. The owners recognize from the outset that they might be obliged to come
up with the cash necessary to buy out the investor(s) upon the investor’s demand.
Thus, this provides an incentive to generate the requisite amount of cash. This
clause provides incentive to the principals to build a business in which the investors
would prefer to continue as principals.
Investors also understood that if they were to invoke such a retraction clause,
they might well place the firm in jeopardy. At the extreme, if the business or its
principals could not generate the requisite buyout cash, exercising a retraction
clause might force the firm into liquidation. The inclusion of a retraction clause,
therefore, is no guarantee that the firm will ultimately be able to accommodate
investors’ exit intentions.
“It’s a setting where you’re a minority shareholder and you say to them
[the principal owners], ‘We have the right to ask for our money-out based

<-----Page 17----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 30

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

on the accountant evaluation and has to be a fair market value and without a discount for being a minority shareholder’, and you grab it all at
once and the business goes under and can’t pay you anyway so its usually
a slow, tedious way to get out.”
“I would take back the loan and then you exit with everybody.”
“The laws of insolvency and bankruptcy prevent you from acting on
retractions because it would put the company further in debt and of
course you can’t do that.”

Shareholder agreements also typically specify how valuation is undertaken in
the event of an intra-shareholder sale and purchase: frequent valuation approaches include consensus, third-party appraisals, and shotgun clauses. Exits through
intra-shareholder transfers tended to be triggered according to whether or not the
firm had met predetermined milestones.
“The initial shareholder’s agreement created around this company
described a number of milestones and those milestones either being hit
or missed by certain dates triggers the sale of the company or a decision
to alter the plan… I think exit strategies need to be determined. We are
also working with people and people need clear and common expectations about what the exit strategies are.”

Decision Making
The model portrayed in Figure 1 suggests that the investment decision is made
at a particular point in time. A more accurate way of looking at this is to regard the
successful culmination of the negotiations as tantamount to a positive decision, recognizing that investors can and do reject opportunities over the entire continuum
of the process. However, there are particular factors that lead to both positive and
negative decisions.
Essential factors prompting investors to make investments. Investors across Canada
in all discussion groups were consistent in identifying and discussing three critical
factors that prompt their investment in a project: people, the product and/or technology potential, and the non-financial value that the investor sees he or she can
bring to a project. This result is very similar to that reported in Watson, Haines, and
Riding (1998, pp. 7 and 15–16).2 Investors in the present study note that the people involved in a potential investment opportunity are the most critical factor in
their decision to make an investment. Many investors said that they would be
spending considerable time with these people, so it is important that the people be
the right ones for the job and be individuals with whom the investor would like to
spend some time.
The investors noted that they look for people who are honest, exhibit a strong
work ethic, understand what it takes to make the business succeed, have invested
in their own business; and have a realistic notion of how to value the business.
____________________
2. Watson, Haines, and Riding suggest two principal groups of attributes, each of which has three and
four subgroups respectively: desirable owner attributes, with subgroups of management track record,
realism (on the part of owners of the business), and integrity and openness of the owner(s); desirable
attributes of the opportunity, which included potential for high profit, a reasonable exit plan, security, and involvement of the investor.

<-----Page 18----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 31

“I want somebody who is honest—if everybody is honest, you usually make
money. If something happens, it’s not because they have screwed you, it
could be bad luck or economic conditions.”
“Il faut s’impliquer directement avec l’entrepreneur pour analyser les
potentiels d’investissement, faire la pré-analyse, faire le montage financier. Il est aussi important avant de rencontrer le promoteur et de pouvoir
faire enquête sur la crédibilité et la solvabilité de ce dernier.”
“A big thing is work ethic—are they willing to put in 60–70–80 hours a
week to build the business.”
“Make sure the entrepreneur understands he gets paid a salary for working really hard—that’s his job and they better understand that in 10 years
time if the shares are worth 2 million dollars, my shares are worth the
same as his on a per share basis.”
“I look that somebody in the company has all the different knowledge
needed—you don’t mortgage the building to fund cash flow.”
“Whether the entrepreneur acknowledges he is missing key ingredients
and step 2 is on what basis is he willing to try and acquire that expertise.”
“The investments I’ve made have been structured pretty well as far as
accounting, paper work and paper trail. When I was starting out in my
business, I thought why would I bother doing all this 5-year forecasting
stuff, I have no idea what my sales are going to be in year 2—I’m just starting out from scratch. But now that I’ve gone through it myself, you can
see that the people who’ve at least taken the time to think about it—
whether its right or wrong—tend to have a better chance of success.”
“The most critical thing there is, if I’m investing in somebody’s company,
if they don’t have money in it, I’m not interested. They have to have something in it—not just sweat equity; sweat equity doesn’t mean a lot. If I’m
standing there holding all the paper… there is a reason the banks like
personal guarantees; they [the entrepreneurs] need to suffer if they are
going to walk away from the business.”

The second critical factor is the market potential for the product or technology. For a minority of investors, the product or technology is even more key than the
people. Investors who express this point of view believe that they can always change
or add to the people necessary to make a business successful, but what they really
want is an extremely promising technology or product. These investors are often
seeking new breakthrough technologies and their approach is to seek these opportunities and if necessary change the people involved in the venture.
“Beyond that if you are looking at something that is coming to you across
your desk I would tend to look more for a technology that is what you
would call “a platform,” like something that has really great potential …
something that is exciting. After that a very key thing are the people
involved.”
“Il faut comme investisseur être capable de visualiser comment l’entreprise pourrait se développer. Cette aptitude vient avec l’expérience.”
“What we look at are people, people and people; the other significant one

<-----Page 19----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 32

32

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

is the magnitude of the market for the product… We like at least North
America or global markets—that is the upside potential, you’ve got to
look at the upside potential in my opinion.”
“I look for management and the markets that they are looking to
penetrate—are they looking just for the New Brunswick region, Atlantic,
North America, these are key things… Once you look at what they are trying to achieve, does management have the ability to do that—do they
have the proper skill sets? Can they execute?”

The third major criteria mentioned by a majority of Canadian private investors
is the value added that the investor judges he or she can bring to a given project.
Virtually all investors believe that other forms of value they add to the projects are
as important as the money they invest (Haines, Madill and Riding, 2002). The following statement by one investor provides an excellent summary of much of the
discussion:
“Provided the business opportunity contemplated meets the first criteria
[in this case, an acceptable fit with the investor’s personal priority for sustainable development] then second level considerations come into play.
These are grouped as follows:
Prior to investing I am guided by the three P’s: People—their character,
background and personality. I am influenced too by their network—by
their other champions and mentors and whether their advisers think as I
do? Patents—strength of and who filed them? Products—competition and
their products, place in the market.
Prior to investment I also look for the 3Cs: Confidence—is the entrepreneur
outgoing and well able to communicate; Character—is the entrepreneur
really driven to succeed—and is this his overriding passion and is that passion driven by money, greed or ego? Is he honest? Do others speak well of
him. I would not care if his only asset was a fine reputation; Common sense—
is the entrepreneur a realist and does he or she posses a practical down-toearth attitude? Can he or she think on their feet? Are they flexible?
I am also influenced by the 3E’s: Experience—background, breath of knowledge and a history of success. Ego—and temperament, drive and openness.
I must know that an individual is a net contributor to his community—a
giver not a taker. Eccentricities—these sometimes take years to unearth.”

Post-Investment Activity
Haines, Madill and Riding (2002) report that angels make substantial nonfinancial contributions in addition to their financial investment. These contributions include ongoing advice, particularly with respect to financing and business
strategy; contacts that include additional sources of financing as well as potential
customers; participation on boards of directors; involvement in hands-on, day-today operations of the firm; business and market intelligence; and credibility. These
contributions, according to Haines, Madill and Riding (2002), may help explain
why angel-financed enterprises are so much more likely to obtain institutional venture capital than firms that had not been angel-financed.
What was apparent from the focus groups was the importance that angels
placed on such activities. For the majority of respondents, being able to provide the

<-----Page 20----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 33

33

benefit of their experience and knowledge is crucial to making their investment
decisions. The following is a sampling of statements to this effect made by discussion participants.
“We tell everybody who comes in to us that ‘you’re not just looking for a
cheque, what you’re also looking for is that ability, the skill level that the
investor brings to the table as well. They don’t have money for no reason
—they have money because they have a business and a business acumen
or an entrepreneurial ability that you need to tie into as well.’”
“When I want to be passive I go to the NASDAQ or the New York Stock
Exchange.”
“I definitely want my hands on the steering wheel and they [business
owners] know that up front.”
“What I like about investing in small companies is that as opposed to
investing in a public company one’s capacity to be able to contribute is
much more limited and the ability to be able to guide and assist and cajole
a smaller company is part of the reason I enjoy my association with them.”
“When I assume angel investment I’m talking about angel where I can
add value.”

The forms of non-financial contributions that private investors mentioned mirror many of the categories identified by Haines and his colleagues. These include
contacts, guidance, and hands-on assistance with the development of the firms.
“I think networking is so important. If you bring someone in and bring in
five or six other people, there is a good chance that those people will have
connections, whether it be accounting, legal or within that particular
business. All the doors fly open.”
“Whether it is a network of contacts and the leverage that comes from
that or personal skill and ability that can be applied to a situation, the
whole aspect of value added is absolutely necessary to move those things
forward.”
“In an investing company, I always take a board position and insist that
proper board governance be put into place. I insist on the development
of a board of directors as a breadth of ability and experience in governance … to hold management’s feet to the fire constantly.”
“… we do a whole service and we can actually … help build the business
plan and raise the capital and bring in managers who do the operating.”

The excerpts from the focus group interviews with angels illustrate that the provision of contacts, guidance, involvement, and governance is not accidental or
serendipitous. Rather, this is intentional, and a valued part of most private
investors’ ways of doing business. However, it is by no means universal and some
angels are involved on a selective basis:
“My background is engineering and project management so I tend to get
involved, [but] only at the procedural level, not at the operating level.”

Angel participants also reported that it is frequently the case that many owners
resist their non-financial contributions. This resistance is often a factor in investors’
decisions to refuse investment. Moreover, even in those firms in which angels had
invested, they report that owners rarely offer thanks:

<-----Page 21----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 34

34

HAINES, MADILL AND RIDING

“… an investment criteria for me is to be able to determine what value I
can add and if I see no value that I can add to an investment then I tend
to walk away.”

In summary, the majority of informal investors see their role as mentors—
providers of contacts, guidance, and hands-on assistance. To be sure, there is a
minority who do not take that view. However, most angels view these non-financial
contributions as a critical aspect (perhaps the most critical element) of their investments in small businesses.
Exits
Cumming and McIntosh (2002) list the following forms of exit (see Table 2):
initial public offering, strategic acquisition, buy-back by the founder(s), secondary
sale by the investor, and write-off. In the event of sale of shares to third parties,
additional provisions of the shareholder agreement may come into play. These
include rights of first refusal, “drag-along,” and “piggyback” rights.3

Definition
the sale of investors’ shares at the point when the business raises
additional capital through the sale of shares to the public. Often,
shares of founders and investors, however, can be subject to hold
periods and escrow requirements;
the sale of the investors’ shares as part of the sale of the firm to a
third-party acquirer. Often, acquirers are “strategic acquirers,”
buyers that have potential synergy to offer or that may be related to
the business as suppliers or clients;
the shares of the owner are repurchased either by the company or by
the staff and other owners of the firm;
the sale, of only the investor’s shares to a third party investor. The
acquirer could be a different investor or a strategic acquirer;
the realization of a capital loss on the wrap-up of a business.

While private investors certainly mentioned IPOs as a means of exit they also
recognized that IPOs were rare:
“… a lot of companies are turning out very solid returns, [have] very good
management, [are] well run, and are trading at ridiculous multiples of
earnings—but it is a way out. Going public is one way of getting out … if
you can find a good broker and there are a few companies out there that
will help you go public at a reasonable rate.”
____________________
3. The right of first refusal provides one shareholder with the option to purchase the shares of another
shareholder when that shareholder wishes to sell his or her shares. According to Thompson, of
Gowling, Lafleur, Hendrerson (1999), “a drag-along right entitles a shareholder (usually the controlling shareholder) who wishes to sell his shares to an arm’s length third party to force the minority
shareholder (the Angel) to sell to the third party at the same time and for the same price. This right
enables the controlling shareholder to maximize his sale price where the third party purchaser
requires 100% of the corporation’s shares. … and “piggyback” rights provide that a shareholder may
not sell his shares to a third party unless the third party offers to buy the shares held by the remaining shareholders on the same terms. Typically the piggyback right is extended by a controlling shareholder to the minority shareholder (the Angel) thereby permitting the Angel to share in any premium paid by the third party buyer for control.”

The most frequently mentioned exit mechanisms were through acquisition:
“We do see in this market is more acquisitions of companies from outside
the jurisdictions than companies going public.”
“You either go public or get acquired. If a potential acquisition comes
along that looks good, that certainly has a lot of appeal depending on the
valuation you get.”

Investors also identified various types of buy-backs as exit mechanisms:
“Another exit strategy that is an extremely valuable one is an employee
buyout strategy and employee share ownership program that allows for
acquisition of the company by employees over time.”
“With my engineering business I transferred my assets internally to longterm employees.”

Another investor provided an example of a secondary sale to other investors:
“There were four partners and we had the opportunity to buy each other
out based on the traditional shotgun … to assess values and that sort of
thing, so that is in place. We haven’t gone the next step in terms of what
we will do with the company as a whole but it will be based on a business
valuation, conducted by a third party and under the terms of a shareholder agreement that compels the company to be sold against certain
milestone events, made or unmade.”

Certainly, the write-off was well known as an exit mechanism:
“Never ever had anybody ask me how do you exit? <everyone laughing>
It’s just done for you.”

Summary and Conclusions
The work described above provides information with respect to the decision
processes of Canadian informal investors. One of the key contributions of the work
is the development of a framework (Figure 1) which was found to be very successful in structuring the qualitative comments of the informal investors regarding
their decision-making processes. The results suggest that the framework is able to
organize the qualitative descriptions that informal investors give of the processes
followed during the informal investment process. However, considerable caution
should be exercised before concluding that this model represents the actual
process that informal investors use in making decisions about informal investments. Recent work in the development of descriptive models of the planning
process suggest that the process is not linear, but rather circular and/or iterative
(Ryans, More, Barclay and Deutscher, 2000). It is likely that the actual process used
in informal investing is similarly non-linear.
The profiles of the angel investors who participated in this study are fully consistent with those documented in previous Canadian research. It was found that
angels are well educated and report considerable experience as investors. They
tend to hold other full-time jobs, limiting the time they can devote to their investments. They account for a considerable amount of investment in new growthoriented businesses, investments usually made at the earliest stages of business
development. These private equity investors would argue that a problem lies in the
shortage of investment-ready businesses in which the principals are willing to
partner with experienced investor-mentors.

Also consistent with previous studies, investors reported learning about potential opportunities mostly from business associates. Evaluation tends to be conducted informally, although some investors have developed extensive sets of due diligence materials. The key dimensions of investable business opportunities are the
market potential of the business and the capability of the principals to commercialize and market the service or product. Investors also seek the opportunity to
make a substantive contribution to the success of the firm.
Two points of difference were noted. First, the acceptance rate of proposals is
higher than that found in earlier studies. Second, the proportion of respondents
stating a satisfactory deal flow is somewhat larger in this study than in previous studies. Both of these results may be attributable to the fact that the investor participants were selected by CCIP site managers. CCIP sites were funded by Industry
Canada with the specific mandate of assisting investors with deal flow and to facilitate the investment process. Some CCIP sites report using and improving upon the
IOP (Investment Opportunity Program): Hopkins (2001), LeBorgne (2001), and
Cooke (2001). This program represents a formal process by which a third party
associated with an economic development agency prepares small businesses seeking informal investment to receive the informal investment before they contact
informal investors. However, a limitation of the present study is that no matching
sample of non-CCIP site affiliated informal investors was obtainable. Therefore, it
is not possible to be sure whether the differences observed are due to general secular trends in the Canadian economy or the active involvement of CCIP sites in the
process of informal investment.
Implications for Researchers, Policy Makers, Informal Investors and Business Owners
A primary implication of this work is the need for a marketing intermediary in
what is otherwise a chaotic and fragmented market. These intermediaries would
provide assistance to nascent entrepreneurs to prepare them to best utilize informal investment. These market makers also provide a mechanism for creating contact between potential informal investors and small business owners who are now
prepared to receive informal investment. By drawing on the findings of this study,
market makers would be able to yet better inform nascent entrepreneurs about
salient aspects of the process and criteria that angels consider important. These
market intermediaries must go beyond simple match making or web sites.
In part the need for market maker intermediaries might be addressed by the
establishment of formal angel groups. Is there a possible role for the private sector
with respect to the development of formal angel groups? Such groups would be
able to spread risk, augment capital availability, and draw on a wider range of people who could counsel prospective SME owners and provide contacts and experience. For this to occur in Canada, however, there is a need to address constraints
imposed by securities regulations.
The results of this research could be of particular interest and value to economic development agencies who are trying to promote the financing of local
small businesses by local informal investors. The results provide useful baseline
data on the investors and their decision making which can be helpful to such
groups in working with local angels and attracting them to winning investment
opportunities.
As well, it is hoped that the results of the study will be of particular value to

<-----Page 24----->Journal.qxd 07/07/03 8:22 AM Page 37

business academics in both their teaching and research on small business creation
and entrepreneurship. It is hoped that the results of this paper could be used in
future research to guide the development of more detailed and formal approaches to understanding investment decisions in general and by angels in particular. In
particular, it should be noted that this research does not address the link between
informal investors and institutional venture capitalists—a subject that certainly
worthy of future research.
Lastly, government policy makers and security regulators who require baseline
data and understanding of the Canadian informal investment process to inform
policy making at both the national and local levels might find the results useful.

Appendix
1. We’d like to begin by asking about the availability of investment opportunities
for you:
a) How do you learn of potential investments?
b) From your experience, are the owners of companies that are seeking investment well prepared to attract private investment? Are they prepared to work
with private investors like you? In what ways are they well prepared? In what
ways are they not well prepared?
c) Can you tell us how you evaluate potential investments? What do you do
when you conduct due diligence? What are you looking for when you conduct
your due diligence?
d) In your experience, what are the most common shortcomings of the business
opportunities that you have reviewed recently?
e)What are the essential factors that prompted you to invest in the firms you
chose? How difficult has it been for you to find investment-ready firms? Have
you been able to find sufficient numbers of investments?
2. We’d like to move to talking about how you work with the companies in which
you invest:
f) What level of involvement do you have with your investee businesses? Can you
give examples of the non-financial contributions that you make to your investee
firms?
g) Can you tell us about any difficulties you encounter when you work with the
companies in which you invest?
h) Can you tell us about the ways that you try to exit from the businesses in
which you have invested? What exit strategies have worked very well for you?
What strategies have not worked well?
3. Are you involved in syndication or networking groups with regard to placing
investments?
i) Can you tell us about how these groups function? (PROMPT FOR “How stable are these groups over time—are they stable and loose, or do they shift frequently?).
j) Do you find these groups to be useful to you? In what ways are they useful? In
what ways are they not useful?
4. Moving towards the last of the questions we would like to discuss with you, we’d
like to talk a bit about tax measures. Do you have any suggestions about what the
Government of Canada could be doing to encourage more private investor activity?
k) Last year, the federal government introduced a number of measures to stimulate angel financing. These included reduced taxes on capital gains and a taxfree rollover provision. What are your views on how these tax measures will stimulate equity financing in Canadian small businesses?
l) What are the three most attractive features about investing in your region
(NAME IT)? What are its three least attractive features?
