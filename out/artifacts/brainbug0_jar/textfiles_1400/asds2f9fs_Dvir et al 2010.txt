Person–Organization ﬁt, the match between individuals and the organizations in which they
work, has been extended to the ﬁt between entrepreneurs' personalities (EP) and the proﬁles
of ventures (VP) they manage (EP–VP ﬁt), and its relationship to the venture's success.
Eighty eight Israeli entrepreneurs working in new ventures responded to a specially designed
questionnaire that included the following parts: (A) provided general data about the new
venture; (B) assessed the venture type along two dimensions: Novelty and Technological
uncertainty; (C) assessed the entrepreneurs' personality traits and (D) assessed the ventures'
success.
Findings revealed that entrepreneurs in high Novelty and high Technological uncertainty
ventures had higher education, they love challenges, and they are more committed,
entrepreneurial, dreamers, creative, risk-takers, intuitive, investigative, and ambitious than
those in low Novelty and low Technological uncertainty ventures. Entrepreneurs in low novelty
and low technological uncertainty ventures were found to be more likely to exhibit behaviors
characterizing Type A personality. In addition, high novelty high technological uncertainty
ventures were found to be signiﬁcantly more successful on measures reﬂecting potential for
building the future when compared to the low novelty and low technological uncertainty
ventures, while on measures reﬂecting short-term success (meeting economic and budget
goals) the results are in favor of the low novelty, low technology groups.
These ﬁndings suggest that entrepreneurs are more attracted to ventures that ﬁt their
personality and the way they manage the new ventures is affected by their personality traits.

1. Introduction
The resurgence of the entrepreneurial spirit has been said to be the most signiﬁcant economic development in recent business
history, and interest in entrepreneurship to have never been higher than it is at the beginning of the 21st century (Zimmerer &
Scarborough, 2001). Entrepreneurs have been described as “the makers of new worlds” (Czarniawaka & Wolff, 1991) who are
“instrumental to the conception of the idea of an enterprise and its implementation” (de Vries, 1996), “innovators are catalysts of
change who continuously do things that have not been done before and do not ﬁt established societal patterns” (Schumpeter,
1934; 1965).
Many researchers throughout the world have turned their attention to the study of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship,
coming from different theoretical perspectives and different basic approaches and using different methodologies. The result has
been an acknowledgement of the fact that entrepreneurship is a very complex and heterogeneous phenomenon (Cunningham &

Lischeron, 1991). They proposed that it is not possible to understand the phenomenon of entrepreneurship if one does not
consider the individual (the entrepreneur), the venture, the environment and the links between them over time.
Findings have been especially mixed regarding the psychology of entrepreneurs (Deakins, 1999; Geldern, 2000; Watson,
Ponthieu & Doster, 1995). So much so, that it has been argued that the trait approach has failed in the case of entrepreneurs
(Gartner, 1989) and that the entrepreneurial personality is nothing but a myth (Shaver, 1995). Only in recent years research on the
entrepreneurial personality has re-emerged as an important area of interest. Rauch & Frese (2007) argue that entrepreneurship
should be an active participant in the revival of personality research, although it should use more sophisticated theories and
methodological approaches. In a study conducted (Rauch & Frese, 2005), they used a meta analysis approach to classify studies on
entrepreneurs' traits according to the speciﬁcity of the of personality assessment. They found that speciﬁc traits produced higher
relationships with both business creation and business success than global trait measures. Furthermore, recent research on
personality and performance has showed that relationships between personality and performance varied depending on what type
of class of performance was researched (Rauch & Frese, 2007).
Another explanation for the mixed results can be the difﬁculty in distinguishing in a meaningful way between different types of
new ventures and as a result, the inability to associate speciﬁc entrepreneurial traits with the needs of various types of ventures.
Based on the Person–Organization (P–O) ﬁt theory (Caplan, 1987; Chatman, 1989; Kristof, 1996), it can be hypothesized that
entrepreneurs with certain personal traits will be attracted to new ventures in which they ﬁnd such a ﬁt. Furthermore, based on
studies showing that individuals are not only attracted to jobs that ﬁt their personality but also tend to be successful in them (Dvir,
Sadeh & Pines, 2006), it can be hypothesized that entrepreneurs personal traits will have an effect of the venture success and that
effect will vary for different types of ventures.
The current study is one in a series of studies that started with examining the ﬁt between project managers, the type of projects
they manage, and the relationship between this ﬁt and project success (Dvir et al., 2006; Pines, Dvir & Sadeh, 2009). In the current
study, the notion of Person–Organization ﬁt is extended further to the case of ﬁt between entrepreneurs and the ventures they
build (EP–VP ﬁt) and its relationship to venture success.
2. Theoretical background
The modern concept of entrepreneurship was introduced by Schumpeter (1934) who deﬁned entrepreneurship as carrying out
of new combinations we call “enterprise” and entrepreneurs are the individuals who carry them out. A person is an entrepreneur
only when he actually “carries out new combinations,” and loses that character as soon as he has built up his business and settles
down to running it as other people run their businesses (p. 74).
Following Schumpeter's deﬁnition, Carland, Hoy, Boulton and Carland (1984) distinguished between the small business owner
and the entrepreneur. A small business owner could be considered an entrepreneur when he starts a new business, but loses that
title when the business enters the mode of regular operation. Gartner (1988), in response, suggested that rather than trying to
deﬁne the entrepreneur, we should, instead, be trying to deﬁne types of entrepreneurship.
2.1. Venture types
Several attempts were made to classify new ventures in a meaningful way that will enable to study the speciﬁc characteristics
of the various venture types. According to Bygrave (1995), for example, some would argue that entrepreneurship research focuses
on high-potential companies with the prospect for substantial growth because these are organizations that have the potential to
make signiﬁcant contributions of employment and wealth to society. However, Carton, Hofer and Meeks (2004) claim that lowerpotential organizations should also be included in entrepreneurship research because by their sheer numbers they make
substantial contributions to employment and wealth creation. Both types of ventures undertake essentially the same tasks to form
a new organization, accumulate and allocate resources, and build networks.
Kunkel (2001) provided a different perspective on new ventures. Following the classical deﬁnition of market pull innovations
vs. technology pushed innovations, he differentiated between Need-Driven New Venturing and Technology-Driven New
Venturing. The high growth-potential new venturing is “Need-Driven.” It ﬁnds its raison d'être in the marketplace. An entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team notices an unfulﬁlled need in the marketplace and sets out to ﬁll it. The entrepreneur may know
little about the technology or the product, but he/she can see the need. This ﬁxation on the need frequently leads practitioners of
Need-Driven New Venturing to ﬁnd new and unique ways of satisfying that need, breaking or rewriting the pre-established “rules
of the game.” The second type of high growth-potential entrepreneurial activity is “Technology-Driven New Venturing” which
comes into being because of the entrepreneur's desire to make the technology accessible. Many of the high-ﬂyers in the leadingedge technologies are Technology-Driven New Ventures. Rather than seeing a need and looking for a way to fulﬁll that need, the
founders of technology-driven new ventures begin with the technology and then ﬁnd a way to make the technology need-fulﬁlling
in the marketplace. Henderson and Clark (1990) have suggested another distinction between autonomous and systemic
innovations and between modular and architectural change. According to their study, the success of architectural innovation is
greatly based on cooperation and strategic alliance using the best kinds of knowledge and capabilities of their partner ﬁrms (Teece,
2000, pp. 63–64).
Although, the above cited references propose different approaches for classifying new ventures and innovations, they all
use one-dimensional scheme for that purpose, whether it is a distinction between low-potential innovations to high-potential

<-----Page 2----->D. Dvir et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 21 (2010) 43–51

45

innovation, market-driven vs. technology-driven, autonomous and systemic innovations or the distinction between modular and
architectural change.
Shenhar and Dvir (2007), who studied project management, suggest a multidimensional conceptual framework for classifying
projects. Their framework includes four dimensions: Novelty, Technology, Complexity and Pace (NTCP)
Novelty
Technology
Complexity
Pace

How novel is the product to its intended customers?
How much new technology is required, from low-tech to super high-tech?
How complicated are the product, the process and the project?
How urgent is the work? Is the timing normal, fast/competitive, time-critical or blitz?

Each dimension of the NTCP framework is divided into three or four categories that enable to deﬁne more accurately the
speciﬁc project at hand. For example, the novelty dimension is divided into three categories: Breakthrough, Platform and
Derivative, in correspondence to the level of newness of the product developed to its intended users.
The OECD (1991) deﬁnes an innovation as an iterative process initiated by the perception of a new market and/or new service
opportunity for a technology based invention which leads to development, production, and marketing tasks striving for the
commercial success of the invention. According to that deﬁnition, it is clear that except for the initial phase of innovation where
the entrepreneur has to secure the funds needed for starting development, all following activities actually describe a project aimed
at the development, production and marketing of a product or service. From that point of view it is only natural to use a similar
classiﬁcation scheme to assess entrepreneurial activities.
Kunkel (2001), as we have seen, distinguishes between need-driven and technology-driven new venturing. However, in real
life most entrepreneurial activities are not either need-driven or technology-driven but rather a spectrum of entrepreneurial
activities driven by a combination of a market need that has a technological solution. The ﬁrst two dimensions of the NTCP
framework, novelty and technology provide a convenient way to describe the spectrum of different types of entrepreneurship,
from pure technology-driven new venturing, through various combinations of market need and technological capabilities to solve
that need to a need that has not yet a technological solution. Novelty addresses the market dimension and describes how new the
idea developed by the new venture is to its potential users (market) or in other words, the gap between the entrepreneur's
understanding of the market needs and the actual needs of potential customers. A breakthrough idea is completely new to the
market; the customers do not have a clue for what purpose or how to use the new product. On the other side of the spectrum, there
are derivative products that provide only minor improvements to an existing product and the customers do not have any difﬁculty
in adopting and using them.
The technology dimension corresponds to the level of technological uncertainty that exists at the onset of the new venture, or
in other words, how many new technologies the venture has to master in order to be able to build the new product in a way that
would answer the customers' needs. Low-Tech new ventures have in-house all the technologies required for the new product,
while on the other side of the technology spectrum there are new ventures that have to develop completely new technologies to
meet the functional capabilities of the new product. The level of technological uncertainty is related to the industry the new
venture is operating in; while a speciﬁc technology might be considered High-Tech for one industry, it might be considered only
Medium-Tech in another, more developed industry.

2.2. Personal characteristics of entrepreneurs
Considerable attention has been given in the literature to the personality of entrepreneurs, trying to identify traits that
characterize entrepreneurs. The personality traits most frequently cited as being characteristic of entrepreneurs include the desire
for independence (Collins & Moore, 1964) locus of control (Brockhaus, 1980; Brockhaus & Horwitz, 1986; Shapero, 1975)
creativity (Wilken, 1979) risk-taking propensity (Rauch & Frese, 2005; Begley & Boyd, 1987; Brockhaus, 1980; Wilken, 1979), need
for achievement (Rauch & Frese, 2005; Begley & Boyd, 1987; McClelland, 1961), and credible role models (Bygrave, 1995; Shapero,
1975). However, these traits have not been conclusively shown to be related to new venture performance, but, they have been
shown to have an inﬂuence in new venture formation (Dvir et al., 2006; Mitchell, 1994). In addition, it is extremely difﬁcult to
demonstrate a causal relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial behavior and success (Brockhaus & Horwitz,
1986; Cooper, Dunkelberg & Woo, 1988). Borman and Motowidlo (1997) who showed that personality factors have contributed
more strongly to contextual performance than task performance, is an exception.
While personality traits failed to predict entrepreneurial success, background characteristics have been shown to do that rather
well. Background characteristics that were shown to be signiﬁcant in previous literature include: prior managerial experience
(Chandler, 1996; Hoad & Rosko, 1964; Lant & Mezias, 1990; Roure, 1986; Roure & Keeley, 1990), prior start-up experience
(Langowitz & Minniti, 2007; MacMillan, 1986; Lamont, 1972), prior management team experience (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996;
MacMillan, Seigel & Narasimha, 1985; McGee, Dowling & Megginson, 1995; Roure & Keeley, 1990; Roure & Maidique, 1986; Stuart
& Abetti, 1990), knowledge, skills and abilities (Chandler & Hanks, 1994; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Mitchell, 1994), and prior
experience in the line of business (Chandler, 1996; Hoad & Rosko, 1964; Roure & Maidique, 1986; Sandberg, 1986). The empirical
studies of background characteristics found more signiﬁcant links to venture performance and successful venture formation, than
studies of entrepreneurial personality traits. The most signiﬁcant determinants of new venture performance that have been shown
are venture strategy and industry structure (Kunkel, 2001; Robinson, 1995; Sandberg, 1986).

The current study revisited the question of the relationship between entrepreneurs' personality traits and their relationship to
venture success. But unlike the previous literature (most of it twenty and more years old) the current study did not look at
entrepreneurial ventures as one-dimensional, but rather used the Novelty and Technology (NT) dimensions, with the assumption
that different ventures have different engineering and managerial needs, and as a result, will be attractive to and appropriate for
different types of entrepreneurs and managers, with different personality traits as well as different background.
The study was conducted under the assumption that if it is possible to make a better and more precise distinction between
different types of ventures and that it will also be possible to identify the relevant personality traits that the entrepreneur has to
posses in order to cope effectively with the challenges the new venture presents.
3. Method
3.1. Hypotheses
Based on Person–Organization ﬁt (P–O ﬁt) theory (Cable & Judge, 1994; Caldwell & O'Reilly, 1990; Caplan, 1987; Collins
& Moore, 1964; Judge & Bretz, 1992; Kristof, 1996) and looking from the perspective of the entrepreneurs (rather than the
perspective of the new ventures) it was hypothesized that entrepreneurs will be attracted to new ventures that ﬁt their
personality.
Based on Contingency theory (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967; Thompson, 1967) and the classiﬁcation framework suggested by
Shenhar and Dvir (2007), it was further hypothesized that the success of different types of ventures will be related to the venture
type and will be manifested by different levels of success along the various success dimensions.
3.2. Sample
Seventy four Israeli new ventures and their entrepreneurs participated in the study. All ventures were in the early stages of
their life, ranging from one year from initiation to ﬁve years. The ventures were mainly R&D oriented in Internet applications,
communication, biotechnology, agriculture, satellite and space. Some of the projects were in entertainment, tourism, and
consulting. Most ventures were independent and not part of a bigger organization. Some of the ventures were hosted in “green
houses” which provided them the necessary funding and infrastructure before the next stage of funding. Of the 88 entrepreneurs
(in several new ventures more than one entrepreneur was interviewed), 78 (89%) were males. Their average age was 39.9 with an
average of 16.7 years of formal education. Most of the entrepreneurs have worked in another new venture prior to establishing the
current venture.
The ventures were chosen randomly by students who were collecting data for their ﬁnal project in college, and as such are
representative of the population of new ventures in Israel.
3.3. Instrument
The instrument, a self-report measure, included four parts. The ﬁrst (A) provided general data about the new venture; the
second (B) assessed the venture type along two dimensions: Novelty and Technological uncertainty; the third (C) assessed the
entrepreneurs' personality and the fourth (D) assessed their ventures' success.
3.3.1. Background
The general data on the new ventures included items such as the industry the venture is active in, when it started operating,
size of the team and the role of the entrepreneur in the new venture.
3.3.2. New venture classiﬁcation
Projects were classiﬁed along the two dimensions (NT) of the NCTP classiﬁcation suggested by Shenhar & Dvir (2007).
3.3.3. Entrepreneurs' personality
Personality traits used in earlier studies to portray project managers and to distinguish among managers and entrepreneurs
(Pines, Sadeh, Dvir & Yanai, 2002, Dvir et al., 2006; Pines et al., 2009), were also used in the current study.
Seven of the “Openness to Experiences” items in the Big Five factors of personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992) were used: 6 items
that indicate high openness to experiences (e.g., interest in solving problems or complicated riddles, interest in many subjects,
thinking differently from others) and one item that indicates low openness to experiences (preference for spending time in a
familiar rather than in an unfamiliar environment). Respondents were asked to what extent they agree with the statements on a
7-point scale ranging from 1 = very much disagree to 7 = very much agree. They received one score for openness to experiences.
Risk-Taking was assessed using The Choice Dilemma Questionnaire (Wallach, Kogan & Bem, 1964). Respondents were
presented with three hypothetical situations and asked to indicate the lowest probability of success in which they would take the
particular risk from 1 out of 10 (the greatest risk) to 9 out of 10 (the lowest risk). The dilemmas included an entrepreneurial risk,
(an engineer with a secure position and low salary is offered a challenging position with options for equity shares if the start-up
is successful), an investment risk and a managerial risk. Respondents received three risk scores: Entrepreneurial, Managerial,
Investment.

<-----Page 4----->D. Dvir et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 21 (2010) 43–51

Two measures were chosen for assessing attitudes towards uncertainty: 1. The “Inventor” personality type in Jung's (Jung,
1990) typology. A 20-item measure is based on this typology (Wilde & Labno, 2002). Out of the 20, 10 items were chosen.
They included Intuition (e.g., preference for thinking about possibilities rather than dealing with actualities) and Perceiving
(e.g., tendency to be ﬂexible rather than pre-planned). 2. The “Investigative” personality type according to Holland's (1997)
classiﬁcation of vocational personalities. The activities that characterize the Investigative type include, for example: reading
scientiﬁc books and solving math problems. Respondents received one score: Investigative.
In addition, the questionnaire included three other clusters of traits that seemed more generally relevant to the study:
entrepreneurial and managerial traits, behaviors associated with Type A personality and attachment styles.
Entrepreneurial traits: personality traits that were found in previous research to characterize high-technology entrepreneurs
(love of challenge and risk-taking) and successful managers (e.g. commitment, involvement, and love of management) (Pines
et al., 2002). A 15-item measure was used. It included 8 items characterizing entrepreneurs and 7 items characterizing managers.
The items were presented randomly and respondents were asked to rate to what extent these traits characterize them on a 7-point
scale.
The activities that characterize the enterprising type according to Holland's (1997) classiﬁcation of vocational personalities
include, for example, running an independent business. Participants received one score: Enterprising.
Type A personality refers to driven individual who feels oppressed by time (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974). This is the person for
whom punctuality is a supreme value; who barks at sluggish salesclerks, and feels compelled to do several things at once. Items
that measure aspects of Type A behavior that seemed relevant for the current study were chosen (e.g. viewing absolute punctuality
as of highest importance, doing and thinking two things at once, hastening the speech of others, getting overly angry when forced
to wait in line, getting impatient when watching others who seem to be doing things too slowly.) Respondents were asked to what
extent these behaviors characterize them on a 7-pont scale from 1 = very little to 7 = very much. They received one score.
Secure attachment: Based on the assumption that in order to succeed, entrepreneurs need to feel self conﬁdent and secure, on
Bowlby's (1969; 1973; 1980) attachment theory and the measure of attachment styles developed by Hazan and Shaver (1987),
three short paragraphs were presented: for secure attachment style: “It is relatively easy for me to become close to people”…for
avoidant attachment style: “I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to people”….for anxious/ambivalent attachment style:
“People are reluctant to get as close as I would like...” Respondents received three scores: Secure, Avoidant and Anxious/
Ambivalent.
3.3.4. Success criteria
New venture success was measured along three dimensions: Meeting planning goals, Business results and creating Future
opportunities and a measure of overall success. These success dimensions and measures were developed following a framework
developed by Shenhar, Dvir, Levy and Maltz (2001) for measuring the success of projects (see Table 1).
3.4. Venture types
The ventures were classiﬁed into three groups based on their level of novelty and technological uncertainty. Out of the twelve
possible combinations, only three groups were selected due to the limited size of the sample and small number of projects. Since
the sample did not include breakthrough or super high-tech products, six possible cells were eliminated. In the second phase,
three groups of ventures were deﬁned according to the type of products they developed:
1. Low to medium-tech, derivative products (products or services that present only modest improvements relative to older products
with respect to the market and level of technology used).
2. Low to medium-tech, platform products (a new generation of products, with low to medium technological uncertainty).
3. High-tech, platform products (a new generation of high-tech products).

4. Results
Analysis of the data included descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) for the entire sample and an analysis of
variance for the differences among the three groups of ventures that differed in their novelty and technological uncertainty (from
low novelty and low technology in group 1 to high novelty and high technology in group 3). The comparisons included the
entrepreneurs' background and personality and their venture's success. Mean values for each group and the mean for the three
groups combined are provided for each variable. Pair- wise comparisons between the mean values of groups, using LSD post-hoc
test and the levels of signiﬁcance are also presented. The F statistic and the corresponding p values for the MANOVA results are
reported as well.
4.1. Entrepreneurs' background
The background information presented in Table 2 reveals a signiﬁcant difference among the three groups (F = 7.88; p b .00) in
level of education. Not surprisingly, the entrepreneurs who started high novelty high-technology ventures had signiﬁcantly higher
education than the entrepreneurs who started low novelty low technology ventures. Mean years of education in group 3 was 18
and in group 1–15.1 years. The entrepreneurs in group 3 were also older than the entrepreneurs in group 1. In addition, the
percentage of women among entrepreneurs in all three groups was rather low (about 11%).
4.2. Entrepreneurs' personality traits
There were several interesting ﬁndings related to the personality traits that characterized entrepreneurs in the different types
of ventures (see Table 3). Entrepreneurs in high novelty and high technological uncertainty ventures (group 3) were found to love
challenges signiﬁcantly more and be signiﬁcantly more committed, entrepreneurial, dreamers, creative, risk-taking, intuitive,
investigative, and more ambitious than entrepreneurs in low novelty and low technological uncertainty ventures (group 1).
Entrepreneurs in low innovation and low technologically uncertainty ventures (group 1) were found to be more likely to
exhibit behaviors characterizing Type A personality (punctual and mad when waiting in line) than those in higher novelty
and uncertainty ventures, however, these differences are not signiﬁcant. A signiﬁcant difference was found in one behavior
characterizing Type A personality (Does several things at a time), but in this case the relationship is U shaped, where the mean
level of group 2 is the lowest.
4.3. Ventures types and success
Table 4 presents the comparison among the three types of groups on the four success dimensions used in the study: Meeting
planning goals (efﬁciency), Business success (economic goals and market penetration), Future opportunities (for new products and
new markets) and Overall success representing a weighted average of all three success dimensions.
As can be seen in Table 4, there was a signiﬁcant difference in six out of the seven success measures presented in the table. In
the ﬁrst two measures (meeting economic goals and meeting budget goals) the results are in favor of the low novelty, low
technology groups. However, the measures reﬂecting the potential for beneﬁts in the future (potential to create a new market,
new product line, new operational and technological infrastructure and knowledge for new products) are all in favor of the high
novelty high technological uncertainty ventures (group 3). The difference was especially notable in the ﬁnding that high novelty
and high-technology ventures had the potential to create a new product line and have created new technological infrastructures
and the knowledge necessary to develop and produce these new product lines.
5. Discussion and conclusion
The comparison between the entrepreneurs in high novelty high-technology ventures and in low novelty low technology
ventures enabled a testing of the ﬁrst hypothesis of the study. The ﬁndings that revealed that the former were signiﬁcantly more
entrepreneurial, creative, risk-taking, investigative committed and challenge lovers while the latter were more likely to exhibit
Type A behavior, offers a tentative support of the ﬁrst hypothesis and of P–O ﬁt theory from which the hypothesis was derived
(Cable & Judge, 1994; Caldwell & O'Reilly, 1990; Caplan, 1987; Carton et al., 2004; Judge & Bretz, 1992; Kristof, 1996). The ﬁndings

traits that entrepreneurs in low novelty low technology ventures possess vs. entrepreneurs in high novelty high-technology
ventures are the largest on being investigative, committed and challenge lover. These traits are probably the best differentiators

between entrepreneurs who are attracted to more risky and uncertain new endeavors as opposed to entrepreneurs who prefer
more certain ventures that might show results in the near future.
The comparison between high novelty high-technology ventures and low novelty low technology ventures in terms of their
level of success enabled a testing of the second hypothesis that was based on Contingency theory (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967;
Thompson, 1967) and on the classiﬁcation of ventures derived from the conceptual framework suggested by Shenhar and Dvir
(2007). Once again, the ﬁndings, which showed high novelty high-technology ventures to be signiﬁcantly more successful when
compared to low novelty low technology ventures on almost all measures of success related to creation of future opportunities to
the new venture, offer tentative support for the second hypothesis. The creation of future opportunities included a potential to
create new markets and product lines, the creation of new technological infrastructure and the creation of knowledge for new
products. Low novelty low technology ventures were shown to perform better in terms of meeting budget and economic goals.
The inescapable conclusion is that high novelty high-technology ventures (group 3) are signiﬁcantly more successful when
compared to the low novelty low technological uncertainty ventures (group 1) in terms of creating new opportunities and
establishing the necessary infrastructure for exploiting these opportunities. However, when looking at short-term results, low
novelty low technology ventures are more efﬁcient and achieve better results in terms of meeting economic and budget goals.
These ﬁndings offer tentative support for the second hypothesis that the success of different types of ventures will be related to the
venture type and will be manifested by different levels of success along the various success dimensions.
Our ﬁndings also provide a tentative explanation to the mixed results regarding the psychology of entrepreneurs (Deakins,
1999; Geldern, 2000; Watson et al., 1995). The current study shows that a careful examination of the market and technological
uncertainties involved in establishing a new venture may provide a meaningful way to distinguish between different types of new
ventures. Using that new conceptual framework for distinguishing among ventures enables to identify and associate speciﬁc
entrepreneurial traits with the needs of various types of new ventures. These ﬁndings support Rauch and Frese (2007) claim that
research on personality and performance has showed that relationships between personality and performance varied depending
on what type of class of performance was researched. They also support the results of Lee and Tsang (2001) indicating that internal
locus of control and need for achievement have positive impact on venture growth.
Another ﬁnding that deserves attention has been mentioned very brieﬂy. This is the ﬁnding that the percentage of women
among entrepreneurs in all groups was rather low (about 11%). This result conﬁrms other studies that show women's
entrepreneurship to be signiﬁcantly lower than that of men (Langowitz & Minniti, 2007), this despite a radical acceleration in the
number of women entrepreneurs in recent years (Weiler & Bernasek, 2001). Women's entrepreneurial activity level has global
implications because starting a business is an occupational channel for women to advance economically (Izyumov & Razumnova,
2000). There are today a few examples of countries that have started promoting entrepreneurship for both women and men
(Bullough, 2006).
As a limitation of the study, the small sample size and limited types of projects are paramount. Other obvious limitations are the
reliance on self-report measures and cross-sectional design. Future studies intended to investigate the relationship between
entrepreneurs' personality and success of their ventures will require a much larger sample and a larger variety of ventures types,
including breakthrough and super high-technology ventures.
