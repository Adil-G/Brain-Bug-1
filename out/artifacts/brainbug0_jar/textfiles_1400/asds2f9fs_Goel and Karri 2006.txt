Entrepreneurs, Effectual
Logic, and Over-Trust
Sanjay Goel
Ranjan Karri

This article complements extant literature on entrepreneurship and trust by proposing a
model of over-trust (the tendency to trust more than what is warranted) using entrepreneurial
characteristics and effectual logic. We trace how entrepreneurs following effectual processes may tend to over-trust. More formally, we propose that specific personality characteristics of the entrepreneur interact with effectual logic to make the entrepreneur more
susceptible to over-trust. The proposed model is value neutral in that we do not imply that
over-trust has negative consequences for entrepreneurs. In fact, it may be part of the overall
risk that entrepreneurs assume in a new venture creation.

Introduction
The entrepreneurial function is one in which the intermediary induces the trust of
several trustors and combines these resources, ordinarily placing them in the hands
of one or more other actors who are expected to realize gains for the original investors
(Coleman, 1990, p. 181).
Entrepreneurs need to trust others and serve as trustees in order to form and grow their
organizations. Trust among entrepreneurs, their coworkers and between the entrepreneurs
and their business partners plays a key role in the early stages of the formation of a new
company (Kohtamäki, Kekäle, & Viitala, 2004). Indeed, trust can even serve as a substitute for institutional deficiencies to promote entrepreneurial activity (Welter, Kautonen,
Chepurenko, Malieva, & Venesaar, 2004). Trust can substitute for formal institutions and
can act as an informal institution, thereby reducing transaction costs (Smallbone & Lyon,
2002).
When entrepreneurs serve as trustors or trustees, they also expose themselves to
vulnerability and risk. Vulnerability to the trustor is an explicit condition of trust (Brenkert,
1998). For instance, Nooteboom (2002) states that “you ‘really’trust someone when you are
willing to forego guarantees on the basis of coercion or self-interest.” Foregoing guarantees
willingly and accepting vulnerability is an important feature of trust, even when trustors
cannot quantify the chance of a possible betrayal (Bachmann, 2001). Welter et al. (2004,
p. 11) note that “. . . entrepreneurs . . . implicitly appear to know or assume that the

no written or explicit rules set out” (emphasis added by authors).
In this article, we focus on modeling why entrepreneurs may trust more than the
situation merits or why they may over-trust, that is, trust where trust may not be warranted. We draw on extant literature on the differences between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs, and the decision-making lens of the effectuation theory (Sarasvathy, 2001)
to argue that entrepreneurs are more likely to over-trust than nonentrepreneurs are. The
effectuation theory provides a useful perspective to investigate trust behavior among
entrepreneurs because it combines both the stock elements of entrepreneurial traits and the
situational characteristics (inputs to an entrepreneurial decision), as well as the process
elements of a decision (constraints and selection criteria). An effectual approach to
decision making is distinct from the widely understood rational decision-making models
that use a causal approach. According to Sarasvathy (2001):
Causal processes take a particular effect as given and focus on selecting between
means to create the effect. Effectuation processes take a set of means as given and
focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means.
Rational decision-making processes that use the causal approach rely on the logic of
prediction as compared to the effectual approach that relies on the logic of control. In
other words, effectual reasoning does not necessarily adopt a systematic acquisition and
analysis of information within certain bounds; instead, it is based on the assumption that
given what one knows, one can control the future, thereby eliminating the need to predict
the future. The effectual approach to decision making is especially relevant in entrepreneurial settings where uncertainty is the order of the day, where markets are nonexistent
and where opportunities are not merely recognized but created (Sarasvathy, Dew,
Velamuri, & Venkataraman, 2003).
We argue that entrepreneurial traits interact with the elements of the effectuation
entrepreneurial process to make entrepreneurs more susceptible to over-trust. Entrepreneurs recognize the set of means that they are endowed with and, given their situational
characteristics, entrepreneurs use certain selection criteria that principally stem from the
affordable loss principle of the effectuation process and assume trust in their partners, as
they do not necessarily evaluate the trustworthiness of their relationships using a causal
approach. We examine the specific entrepreneurial characteristics and the typical situational characteristics that entrepreneurs face and apply the effectual logic of decision
making to establish links to the entrepreneurial propensity to over-trust. Our model is
value neutral in the sense that we do not believe that over-trust is an undesirable risk for
entrepreneurs to take. Rather, we believe that by modeling antecedents of over-trust
through the effectuation lens we shed light on risks that may be hidden and subconsciously assumed or actively ignored by the entrepreneurs. Our overall argument utilizes
well-established results from the psychological traits literature in entrepreneurship on the
ability of entrepreneurs to engender trust in other individuals combined with placing a bet
against opportunism through an effectual logic as the drivers of entrepreneurial activity.
The model, therefore, details how Coleman’s (1990) characterization of the role of
entrepreneur as tertius gaudens––the arbiter of trust––may work.
We begin with a brief overview of the literature to discuss the definitions of trust and
over-trust and to state the significance of trust and over-trust in the entrepreneurial context.
In the next section, we introduce the tenets of the effectuation theory, which serves as
a useful lens to understand the entrepreneurial process and the importance of over-trust
in entrepreneurial relationships. Based on the assumption that entrepreneurs predominantly apply effectual logic, we develop propositions as to how the unique attitudes of

entrepreneurs.

Literature Review and Model Development
Trust and Over-Trust
Trust is a complex construct that has been conceptualized in multiple ways; yet a
common definition of trust suggests that it is “a psychological state comprising the intention
to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions and behavior of
another” (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). A decision to trust is also concomitantly a decision to accept the vulnerability (and the risk of loss if the positive expectations
of another prove to be misplaced). On the positive side, trust implies that actors involved in
trusting relationships will veer away from the tendency of seeking self-interest with guile
or, in other words, will avoid opportunism. The definition suggests that trust is relational as
it involves interdependence and neither party in the relationship has complete control over
the other. To the extent that there is an inability to control, the relationship is fraught with
unpredictable outcomes in the relationship between the trustor and the trustee.
Trust as an attitude has cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. The cognitive component of trust suggests a belief or an expression of faith and confidence that
the trustor holds with regard to the trustee. The affective component of trust evokes
emotions such as a sense of security, both physically and psychologically (Wicks,
Berman, & Jones, 1999). The behavioral intention component of trust refers to the
ability of a person to rely upon another’s words and upon the actions of another. Behavioral intention is a strong predictor of trusting behavior that may vary from high levels
of trust to low levels of trust between the trustor and the trustee (McKnight, Cummings,
& Chervany, 1998). Acceptance of vulnerability in an exchange relationship implies
surrendering of power by the trustor to the trustee with an expectation that the trustee
will not take advantage of the situation and cause harm. Therefore, inherent in a trustbased relationship is the risk in the sense of perceived probability of loss and interdependence in that the interests of the trustor cannot be achieved without reliance on the
trustee (Rousseau et al., 1998).
Trust is useful to the trustor to the extent that the trustee is trustworthy (Hardin, 1996).
While trust may be assumed consciously or habitually, trustworthiness is revealed only
after the outcome of the decision to trust is realized. While opportunistic tendencies are
not transparent ex ante (Williamson, 1985), individuals will attempt to be trustworthy
even if the reality is otherwise, leading to over-trust in the relationship. Goel, Bell, and
Pierce (2005) proposed: “Over-trust reflects a condition where one chooses, either consciously or habitually, to trust another more than is warranted by an objective assessment
of the situation.” We refine this definition further in the context of the entrepreneurs’
trusting behavior by forgoing reliance on deviation from the objective merits of the
situation. We observe that some people can trust in contexts where others may urge
caution and seek cautionary safeguards. In this respect, over-trust can be viewed as
instrumental in making deals under the assumption that the other parties will keep their
end of the bargain. The assumptions guiding over-trust in this context are diametrically the
opposite of Williamson’s (1985) prescription of assuming opportunism in the same
context. In other words, the effectual entrepreneur is placing a bet in the opposite direction
of the Williamsonian entrepreneur.

<-----Page 3----->Over-trust does not reflect a conscious irrational belief that may result in “blind trust,”
which is deplete of any assessments or calculations (Williamson, 1993). Instead, overtrust suggests either an unwillingness to predict the future by taking into account the
potential risk involved in the relationship or an inability to assess the intentions of the
other party and the nature of the relationship. From a rational perspective, such a situation
may be labeled as a case of willful negligence of risk resulting from overconfidence or
naivety. We propose that entrepreneurs choose not to predict the future. They are often
confronted with situations where they are not in a position to make any objective assessments of the risk involved, thereby denying them the ability to predict the future.
The importance of trust is highlighted in the context of numerous business relationships, whether it is interpersonal, institutional, or organizational. The entrepreneurial
context is characterized by numerous interpersonal relationships (often untested) under
conditions of uncertainty, especially in the formative stages of an enterprise (Larson,
1992). The objects of trust change systematically with personal trust in the early stage to
institutionalized trust in the later stages of new business development (Kohtamäki et al.,
2004). For entrepreneurs, the early stages of venture creation are crucial where the level
of uncertainty is the highest and the degree of predictability is the lowest. During the very
early stages, entrepreneurs decide the extent to which they would like others to get
involved and the extent to which they place their confidence in others. In this context, trust
needs to emerge rather quickly to enable a smooth process of venture creation and
development. Such a form of trust is referred to as “swift trust”: a form of trust that is
prevalent in temporary groups of individuals who do not have history with each other or
do not necessarily envision any continuation of pursuits of mutual interests (Meyerson,
Weick, & Kramer, 1996). Therefore, swift trust is often based on faith in the entrepreneur’s (the individual responsible to coordinate the individuals in the group) own ability
and the expectation from the partners in the trusting relationship (Harrison, Dibben, &
Mason, 1997). The so-called swift trust relations are pieced together in an almost ad hoc
fashion to exploit the contingencies that arise in the early stages of venture creation and
are not necessarily resulting from existing social networks through strong ties, instead
arising spontaneously or serendipitously through weak ties (Granovetter, 1973). Entrepreneurial relationships not strictly based on existing social networks and coupled with
unclear expectations of the future give rise to conditions conducive to the occurrence of
over-trust. In the absence of perfect information, entrepreneurs are not in a position to
conduct a systematic evaluation of objective criteria. Therefore, entrepreneurs make bets
on relational outcomes, leading to situations of over-trust.

Effectuation and Over-Trust
An integral part of understanding the process of creation of new ventures involves
understanding entrepreneurial decision making. Sarasvathy (2001) proposed that entrepreneurs predominantly apply effectual logic to guide their decision making. Effectuation
is a decision-making process or rather a type of human reasoning that involves choosing
between possible effects using a given set of means, whereas the causation process
involves choosing a set of means to achieve a desired effect. According to Sarasvathy
(2001), a better understanding of decision making by entrepreneurs is developed by
viewing the entrepreneurial process through the framework of effectuation rather than
causation, even though the processes of causation and effectuation are likely to occur
concurrently. Effectual logic involves consideration of the given set of means, possible set
of effects, constraints on such possible set of effects, and the selection criteria of the
desired effect from the set of possible effects. Unlike causal logic that involves careful
480

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->planning for the acquisition of the means to achieve the desired effect, an effectual
approach to decision making is characterized by reconfiguration of means until the desired
effect emerges from the possible set of effects. Effectual logic is applied especially in
situations where the future is highly uncertain and the precise nature or characteristics of
the objectives are not known with any amount of certitude.

The Simplot Case: Contrasting Effectuation and Causation
A compelling illustration of the contrast between effectual and causal processes at
work is found in the way that the Idaho-based potato giant, The Simplot Company,
evolved from its effectual entrepreneurial origins under the leadership of its founder J.R.
Simplot (Anders, 2004). The founder’s son, Scott Simplot, approaches the business with
a causal approach in his pursuit to consolidate the company’s fortunes.
For nearly 8 decades, J.R. Simplot of Boise, Idaho, now a nonagenarian, grew his
modest pig farm to a multibillion empire with a wide spectrum of business interests
ranging from its dominant potato farm and cattle farm businesses to gold mines in the
Dominican Republic and coconut operations in Columbia. J.R. Simplot’s exuberance
and homegrown ingenuity took him on numerous entrepreneurial endeavors in a variety
of landscapes. J.R. succeeded and relished his entrepreneurial adventures based on
“hunches.” According to his son, Scott Simplot, J.R. had to “try everything.” Simplot
enterprise ventured into processing onion, iron ore mining, fish farming, hamburger
patties, gold mining in the Dominican Republic, and plywood and coconut operations in
Columbia among others. Few of these decisions were made by detailed analysis or causal
logic. Many of these were driven by J.R. Simplot’s ambition and interests, combined with
information about these projects. Simplot is now a $3-billion company with worldwide
operations with a focus on potato processing, fertilizers, cattle ranches and a presence in
phosphate mines and silica production.
During the 1970s, J.R. Simplot began to cede control of his empire to his son,
Scott Simplot, MBA. Stark differences in approaches to business became apparent. Scott
Simplot, driven by efficiency motives, argued with his father over diversification moves,
budgets, and technology. Under the leadership of Scott Simplot, several ailing plants were
eliminated; workers were laid off and family interests in nonperforming ventures were
scaled back. Because of the slow growth in Simplot’s livestock operations, Scott Simplot
took the step of reducing the size of cattle feedlots and relocated Simplot’s fertilizer unit
to Boise in order to tighten controls over costs and speed up decision making. J.R. Simplot
was less than pleased at his son’s moves driven by analysis and calculation. He expressed
his frustration in a symbolic gesture of “You are fired.” By then, of course, J.R. was but
a nominal head of the gigantic family enterprise and the best that J.R. could do was to
reminisce his adventurous days and hope that his son Scott would succeed.
The contrast in the distinct approaches of J.R. Simplot and Scott Simplot is illustrative
of the effectual approach of the entrepreneurial father and the causal approach of the
managerial son. For the purpose of illustration, some of the categories of differentiation
between the two approaches (based on Sarasvathy, 2001) as applied to the Simplot case
are illustrated in Table 1.

The Link between Effectuation and Over-Trust
We adopt the theoretical lens of effectuation to understand entrepreneurial decision
making to develop the antecedents of over-trust in the bilateral relations that entrepreneurs
engage in. In examining the effectuation process of decision making, we examine the

The goal is given. He had to ensure that Simplot Inc. dealt with threats

Armed with the analytical tools that he learned in his MBA program, Scott
is driven by his principal criteria of expected return. He systematically
pruned the businesses along the efficiency criterion as long as the
expected returns were achieved.
Scott focused on exploiting the knowledge available to him. He emphasized
the use of technology (upgrading constantly), taking advantage of
opportunities that emerged in ventures abroad through his knowledge
that it was not necessary to own physical assets to be successful in new
ventures.
Consolidation of existing markets is the main thrust.

means available to entrepreneurs that may lead to their tendency to over-trust. Table 2
provides an overview.
For instance, the “givens” in the effectuation processes necessitate entrepreneurial
hunches and leaps, which are more likely to lead to over-trust as entrepreneurs craft a
sense-making glue to create their worldview, which may stymie nonentrepreneurs operating under rational causation. The effectuation decision criteria of affordable loss or
acceptable risk make over-trust acceptable if spread (diversified) over multiple trust
contexts. Failure from prior over-trust decisions may not make people driven by effectual
logic more conservative (unlike people using causal logic) because affordable losses may
be considered the cost of doing business, and occasional failures as positive signs of
entrepreneurial qualities. This may explain serial entrepreneurs. If loss from trusting is
seen as affordable, then trust will be deposed in contexts where calculative logic dictates
caution and avoidable loss. Actor-dependent choices of effect make the entrepreneur’s
characteristics particularly critical for outcomes.
Similarly, fluid competencies of exploiting contingencies as they arise imply that
entrepreneurs make stopgap arrangements to exploit immediate contingencies rather than
a master plan as causation would dictate, increasing the likelihood of over-trust. Since
effectuation is more relevant in human action and entrepreneurs assume dynamic, nonlinear, and ecological environments, they do not expect to be perfect in their trust
decisions but as long as they are not catastrophically wrong, they are willing to trust (and
over-trust).
Entrepreneurs also may regard trusting as an inevitable and uncontrollable aspect of
an unpredictable future and, therefore, may focus on aspects that are controllable because
of their bias for action rather than inaction or causal analysis. Rather than going for the
efficiency of a single course of analyzed action, they focus on the pursuit of multiple
opportunities, each fraught with risk and inefficiency but none of them, in their perception,
enough to lead to ruin. Because of their focus on alliances and cooperative strategies, they
stretch their networks and rely more heavily on their partners and their partners’ networks.
This stretching can cause stresses in the use of disciplining mechanisms and communication inefficiencies, leading to delay and loss of transmission of critical communication.

<-----Page 7----->This could lead to pockets of over-trust developing in their networks as their perception of
risk in trusting someone is understated and not accounted for by real, but unknown,
information embedded in each relationship.
Entrepreneurs focus only on those things that they control. Therefore, they tend to
frame “trust” as uncontrollable, and thus over-trust. They may view trusting someone as
an integral risk of doing business, and thus a constraint. As a result, they may not devote
any cognitive capacity of trying to reduce the risk of over-trust. In other words, viewing
trusting others as a constraint may lead them to view making the distinction between
trusting and over-trusting as superfluous.
In summary, entrepreneurs driven by effectuation processes are more likely to have
a larger number of over-trust relationships than nonentrepreneurs because they overtrust. In addition, in sharp contrast to the Williamsonian entrepreneurs who are focused
on protecting themselves from opportunism, these same entrepreneurs are more likely to
enter into greater numbers of deals, some of which may turn out to be economically
viable ex post. However, that does not imply that they fail more often than nonentrepreneurs or Williamsonian entrepreneurs do because of the criteria of affordable loss. In
each specific case where they over-trust, their losses are likely to be small. In cases
where multiple over-trust relationships cause failure, entrepreneurs frame new opportunities to repose trust (over-trust) in new parties. In addition, in cases where trust appears
as a justified ex post, these entrepreneurs create new economic opportunities where none
existed before.

Characteristics of Entrepreneurs and Over-Trust
The effectuation theory puts the focus back on entrepreneurs and their worldview,
which makes them different from nonentrepreneurs in the specific way they process
information and sense and create opportunities by following an effectual logic. Historically, researchers studied the traits of entrepreneurs such as internal locus of control,
self-efficacy (Markman, Balkin, & Baron, 2002), high need for achievement (McClelland,
1961), risk propensity (Brockhaus, 1980), and other demographic characteristics such as
age, education, and family ties. The trait approach is useful in understanding personality
characteristics that suggest why certain individuals are likely to be more entrepreneurial.
However, the trait approach is limited in its ability to describe entrepreneurs (Gartner,
1989). According to Gartner (1989), in addition to developing an understanding of the
traits of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial behavior should be the focus of entrepreneurship
literature. A useful framework to understand the behavior is the theory of planned behavior (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), according to which the underlying attitudes create intentions that eventually lead to behavior. Therefore, we will focus on both traits and attitudes
of entrepreneurs that have an impact on how entrepreneurs behave and attempt to determine why they are more prone to use effectual logic, which leads to over-trust. In this
article, our object of behavior is the trust propensity of entrepreneurs. More specifically,
we focus on the tendency of entrepreneurs to trust too much (over-trust).
In the role of a trustor, entrepreneurs influence the level of trust between those
partners whose interests are focused on the success of venture creation. Entrepreneurial
attitudes and the past experiences in trust-based relationships cause the entrepreneur in the
role of a trustor to overestimate the likelihood of continued positive outcomes of trust and
thereby making the decision to trust as a “default choice” (Bell, Oppenheimer, & Bastien,
2002).
484

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->Nonconformity
Originality, rule conformity, and efficiency are three subconstructs used in measuring
innovation and adaptation (Kirton, 1976). Individuals can channel their creativity toward
adaptive innovations that follow accepted rules and procedures. High conformity to rules
will likely produce adaptive or incremental innovations and solutions. Low conformity
to rules, on the contrary, enhances originality, resulting in original innovations (Mudd,
1996; Rosenfeld, Winger-Bearskin, Marcic, & Braun, 1993). Entrepreneurs display a high
degree of nonconformity as compared to nonentrepreneurs. Therefore, challenging the
status quo is a strong indicator of entrepreneurial attitudes.
Nonconformity as a dominant characteristic results in entrepreneurs’ ignoring conventional signals or warnings against opportunism. The ability to recognize opportunities
that are not visible to others is a by-product of the nonconformity exhibited by entrepreneurs. While others may view rules and norms as constraints, successful entrepreneurs,
with a worldview that does not necessarily conform to the “conventional wisdom,” take
advantage of opportunities that are invisible to others. The benefits of challenging the
existing norms will promote over-trust. For instance, while some are bound by the norms
in a culture and therefore may be cautious about the amount of trust they place in others,
entrepreneurs will defy these norms and place their trust without appraising the likelihood
of failure of trust.
Proposition 1: Entrepreneurs with a high degree of nonconformity are more likely to
over-trust.

Self-efficacy
The persistence and effectiveness of entrepreneurs is an effect of the belief that they
are capable of successfully completing a task or attaining a goal. A study that examined
patent inventors found that those who successfully started businesses had a significantly
higher self-efficacy than those who did not (Markman et al., 2002). Self-efficacy is a belief
that reflects high levels of core self-evaluation including self-esteem, emotional stability,
and internal locus of control (Judge, Erez, Bono, & Thoresen, 2003). Self-efficacious
individuals maintain a positive, optimistic, and determined view (Watson, Clark, &
Tellegen, 1988). As an attitude, self-efficacy is found to be a reliable predictor of entrepreneurial behavior (Chen, Green, & Crick, 1998). An entrepreneurs’ perceived ability to
muster the necessary resources for a start-up is significantly related to their self-efficacy
(Erikson, 2002).
Perceived self-efficacy has a significant effect on aspiration levels, goal commitment,
task persistence, and work attitudes (Gist, 1987). Self-efficacy will therefore influence the
entrepreneurs’ perceived ability to control the behavior of people they trust. Such a
perception also leads to their belief that they are in a position to predict any contingencies
that arise out of such a trust relationship. The outcomes of trusting others are seen as
positive owing to the optimistic view of self-efficacious entrepreneurs. For instance, some
studies found a significant positive effect of actual self-efficacy on risk taking (Heath &
Tversky, 1991). Similarly, perceived self-efficacy leads to risk taking as entrepreneurs
frame risky choices as opportunities that they can control and manage through their
competence (March & Shapira, 1992). Any negative signals are dismissed, which diminishes their capability to consider any negative outcomes of trusting others.
Entrepreneurs are also susceptible to overconfidence as reflected in their tendency to
make risky decisions (Busenitz, 1999). Overconfidence as a decision-making bias results
from an anchoring and adjustment heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Decision

despite the availability of additional information (Schwenk, 1988). Risk propensity is
found to have a significant positive association with self-efficacy. Individuals who believe
in their abilities are more likely to see opportunities in a risky choice, while individuals
with low self-efficacy are more likely to see threats and consequently take fewer risks
(Krueger, Jr. & Dickson, 1994).
Proposition 2: Entrepreneurs with high self-efficacy are more likely to over-trust.

Achievement Motivation
Entrepreneurs are more achievement-oriented than the general population (Hornaday,
1982). Compared to entrepreneurs, managers of large firms showed a higher need for
power and a lower need for achievement (McClelland & Winter, 1969). Tenacity and the
single-minded pursuit of opportunities is a common characteristic of entrepreneurs. Under
conditions of trust, signals from initial small losses are often ignored. Entrepreneurs have
a tendency to view initial setbacks as a motivation to persevere through the “rough
weather.” A high-achievement orientation may therefore result in an unwarranted placement of one’s trust in others.
Proposition 3: Entrepreneurs with a high-achievement orientation are more likely to
over-trust.

Preference for Innovation
Entrepreneurs are distinct in their creative urge and innovativeness (Drucker, 1985;
Schumpeter, 1934). Empirical studies conclude that entrepreneurs are significantly different from managers in their preference for innovation (Carland & Carland, 1991;
Timmons, 1990). Managers are typically inclined toward actions that are efficient rather
than creative. Experimentation and creativity feed the entrepreneurial drive and make
entrepreneurs hypersensitive to opportunity recognition. This preference for innovation
implies that entrepreneurs are unfazed by lack of priors in a given context. In addition,
they have a limited “overhang of history” because of their sensitivity to the novelty of the
situation rather than similarity with priors. These characteristics are more likely to cause
them to over-trust more than a nonentrepreneur operating under a causal logic.
Proposition 4: Entrepreneurs with a preference for innovation are more likely to
over-trust.

Contribution of Culture
Following Hofstede’s research on cultural values (Hofstede, 1980), several studies
examined the association between cultural dimensions and entrepreneurial behavior.
Important cultural dimensions studied in the context of entrepreneurial behavior are
individualism–collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power-distance, and masculinity–
femininity (Shane, 1992). In general, the findings of the empirical studies suggest that
cultures characterized by high individualism, low uncertainty avoidance, low power
distance, and high masculinity exhibit higher levels of entrepreneurial activity (cf. Hayton,
George, & Zahra, 2002). For example, internal locus of control and innovativeness were
found to be dominant in individualistic and low uncertainty avoidant cultures (Mueller &
486

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->Thomas, 2000). Comparisons of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs across cultures
suggest that entrepreneurs are similar in their characteristics across cultures and entrepreneurs are similar in cultural values regardless of their national affiliation (McGrath,
MacMillan, & Scheinberg, 1992).
According to Fukuyama (1995), levels of trust at the nation-state level manifest
themselves at the individual level (Fukuyama, 1995). Therefore, it is relevant to study the
relationship between the dimensions of culture at the nation-state level and the phenomenon of over-trust at the individual level. Individuals with collectivistic values rely on
close interdependent relationships. In contrast to those with individualistic values who
tend to engage in self-serving behavior, individuals in collectivistic cultures are likely to
be prone to over-trust. We therefore argue that entrepreneurs with collectivistic values tend
to rely on informal trust-based relationships. Trustworthiness is assumed in such cultures
in contrast to those who espouse individualistic values. Entrepreneurs in individualistic
cultures are more cautious and guarded in trusting others.
Proposition 5: Entrepreneurs in collectivistic cultures are more likely to over-trust
than do entrepreneurs in individualistic cultures.
Uncertainty avoidance is an important dimension identified by Hofstede (1980). Low
uncertainty avoidance suggests that individuals accept uncertainty and high uncertainty
avoidance suggests that individuals are apprehensive of uncertainty. Acceptance of uncertainty signifies the readiness with which individuals are willing to make changes, even if
it means departing from past relationships. Low uncertainty avoidance leads to opportunistic behavior when faced with a threat (Doney, Cannon, & Mullen, 1998). Mueller and
Thomas (2000) found an empirical support for a strong correlation between low uncertainty avoidance and internal locus of control. Therefore, entrepreneurs in low uncertainty
avoidance cultures are more likely to exploit any trust-based relationship, while in a high
uncertainty avoidance culture, entrepreneurs are more likely to persist with trust-based
relationships despite the perceived threat in the environment.
Proposition 6: Entrepreneurs with low uncertainty avoidant values are less likely to
over-trust than do entrepreneurs who are high uncertainty avoidant.

Entrepreneurs’ Prior Experience
Over-trust is likely to occur due to experiences that indicated trustworthiness among
partners. Previous entrepreneurial success involving trusting relationships are likely to be
used as indicators of trustworthiness regardless of the nature of the new situation. Serial
entrepreneurs who had positive outcomes from their previous relationships will have
difficulties in forming a neutral assessment of the trustworthiness even if the changed
circumstances warrant such an assessment.
Proposition 7: Serial entrepreneurs with positive experiences from trusting others
are more likely to be prone to over-trust.
Effectual reasoning of entrepreneurs employs the principle of affordable loss or
acceptable risk rather than expected return. The emphasis of entrepreneurs in such an
event is on experimenting with many strategies with the given set of means and relies on
their ability to create options in the future as opposed to maximizing returns in the present
(Sarasvathy, 2001). An affordable loss or an acceptable risk means that entrepreneurs may
risk over-trusting if the size of the gamble is relatively small and does not evoke a ruin

<-----Page 11----->context. Unlike a nonentrepreneurial person, negative experiences from prior over-trust
decisions may not make entrepreneurs hold back because affordable losses may be
considered an inevitable cost of doing business and occasional failures as positive signs of
entrepreneurial qualities. Despite the calculative logic warranting caution, when the loss
from trusting is seen as affordable, trust will be deposed.
Proposition 8: Entrepreneurs with prior negative experiences in trust-based relationships combined with diversified trust relationships are prone to over-trust.
Successful entrepreneurs gain a reputation for making the right choices and build an
aura of “invincibility” around them in their ability to establish successful new ventures.
While the success of entrepreneurs may be specific to an area of expertise, their ability to
start new enterprises may engender a sense of confidence in others with respect to their
ability to succeed in other areas as well. Goel et al. (2005) refer to this phenomenon as
“cross-domain errors.” For instance, Donald Trump is seen as the most successful entrepreneur. Over time, those who bestowed their trust upon him and were satisfied with the
results are prone to trust Mr. Trump in areas that are not part of his domain. Such a
generalization of the abilities of a successful entrepreneur across a domain leads to
over-trust on behalf of the trustors. Entrepreneurs are more prone to these “errors” (in a
causal sense) since they develop working hypotheses rather than comprehensive ones and
settle on the “best” and first-available cues to take action rather than being overly
analytical.
Proposition 9: Entrepreneurs may commit more cross-domain errors, leading to
over-trust.

Discussion and Conclusion
We develop a model of why entrepreneurs may over-trust. A summary of the propositions developed in this article are summarized in Table 3. Trust is usually considered a
positive attribute in a situation, even though trust and risk are two sides of the same coin
(Moesel, Fiet, Busenitz, & Barney, 1996). Over-trust in this article refers to conditions

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->where the trust deposed is independent of the merits of the situation, thereby exposing
trustors to greater risks that are invisible to them. Effectual logic used by entrepreneurs
plays a dominant role in causing over-trust and is the basis of the role of entrepreneurs as
tertius gaudens (Coleman, 1990). This article advances knowledge and contributes to
detailing effectuation by tracing specific personality aspects of entrepreneurs (the givens)
that may lead them to over-trust. While we have focused on entrepreneurial characteristics
and their relationship to over-trust, future research could also focus on how effectual
processes lead to over-trust more directly. That is, whether the elements of effectual logic
have main effects on over-trust, as we have outlined in Table 2. For instance, do the
selection criteria employed by entrepreneurs make them more liable to over-trust? How
does the entrepreneurial propensity for sense making and bias for action affect their
perception of vulnerability in trust contexts? Does the way in which entrepreneurs use
networks (relative to nonentrepreneurs) lead to over-trust?
Even though over-trust could have negative consequences, the model proposed here is
value neutral. The fact that entrepreneurs may over-trust more often than nonentrepreneurs does not necessarily mean that it has negative outcomes for entrepreneurs, their
ventures, or even entrepreneurial activity in general. Over-trusting may be part of entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurs’ bias for action and effectual logic may make
over-trusting part of the risks that entrepreneurs take and the opportunities that entrepreneurs create. Viewing over-trust as a predictor construct, it would be an empirical question
if in fact over-trust causes entrepreneurs to fail more often, as one would predict from
causal logic. What would be at least as useful to investigate, however, would be whether
the initial condition of over-trust causes changes in trustee behavior subsequently, leading
to a level of trust being in line with that required by the situation. In other words, is
entrepreneurial optimism and risk taking infectious and inspiring to cause a “change of
heart” in the trustee over time? This could be one way in which entrepreneurial activity at
a collective level could have a significant positive externality in an entrepreneurial climate.
Over-trusting by a population of entrepreneurs could make trusting others relatively
unconditionally a cultural norm and isolate people who violate this collective norm. While
outcomes of over-trust is beyond the scope of this article, future research could detail the
processes through which this takes place as well as identify other effects of over-trust at
individual, firm, institutional, cultural, and national levels.
In this article, we have focused on why entrepreneurs may over-trust. As a trustee,
entrepreneurs engage in establishing their trustworthiness. Trustworthiness increases the
probability of success for an entrepreneur as it provides access to resources and leverages
the strength of networks and relationships between crucial partners in the creation and
management of new ventures. Future research could pursue the notion of whether entrepreneurs in their role as trustees engender over-trust in themselves. In other words, do
entrepreneurs tend to emit signals of trustworthiness (even unwittingly) when none exists?
Several proxies of trust have been acknowledged in literature such as participation in a
network and moral and ethical beliefs (Fukuyama, 1995). Because there is value in
projecting trustworthiness, trustees are constantly striving to reinforce their image of
trustworthiness either through weak signals or through tangible actions. One could argue
that in their pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities using effectual logic, entrepreneurs
are likely to promote over-trust by projecting trustworthiness when it may not exist. Some
of the traits and behaviors of entrepreneurs could make them more prone to engender
over-trust by trustors, even without any specific motivation or concerted action directed at
this outcome.
There are some practical implications of understanding the causes of over-trust as well.
Entrepreneurial activity involves taking risks, and accepting and recognizing over-trust as

quick to “size-up” potential partners and associates; awareness of over-trust may make
entrepreneurs more sensitive to the trust-related cues in the situation. In addition, entrepreneurs may have a better assessment of differences and a worldview of potential associates
who are entrepreneurs relative to nonentrepreneurs. At the margin, this could improve the
strength and quality of their network as well as their chances of success.
In conclusion, this article complements extant literature on entrepreneurship and trust
by proposing a model of over-trust using entrepreneurial characteristics and effectual
logic. In the process, it highlights how specific entrepreneurial characteristics could lead
to over-trust in combination with effectual logic, leading to a greater understanding of the
role that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship play in trust formation and economic opportunity creation in their role as trustors.
