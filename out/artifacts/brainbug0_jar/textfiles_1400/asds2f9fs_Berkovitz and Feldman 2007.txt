Abstract
This paper examines how innovation strategy influences firms’ level of involvement with university-based research. Our results
suggest that firms with internal R&D strategies more heavily weighted toward exploratory activities allocate a greater share of
their R&D resources to exploratory university research and develop deeper multifaceted relationships with their university research
partners. In addition, firms with more centralized internal R&D organizations spend a greater share of their R&D dollars on
exploratory research conducted at universities. In contrast to other external partners, we find evidence suggesting that universities
are preferred when the firm perceives potential conflicts over intellectual property.

Firms face two interrelated decisions when they
engage in innovation. The first is the strategic decision as
to what balance to strike between the exploration of new
opportunities and the exploitation of existing capabilities
(March, 1991; Levinthal and March, 1993; Tushman and
O’Reilly, 1996). The most successful firms are ambidextrous, developing ideas for new products and investing in
new capabilities for growth while simultaneously refining existing products to maximize current capabilities
(O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004). The balance selected is
influenced by internal research and development (R&D)
organizational structure (Argyres and Silverman, 2004)
and differentiates the firm’s innovation strategy from

that of other firms in the same industry (Tushman and
O’Reilly, 1996). The second, and related, decision is
how to best allocate scarce R&D resources between
internal activities and external alliances (Pisano, 1991;
Chesbrough, 2003). While large firms conduct significant amounts of internal R&D, cross-boundary alliances
provide access to specialized knowledge that may be
difficult, if not impossible, to bring into the firm. R&D
alliances augment and extend firms’ internal efforts to
achieve strategic objectives. In sum, the firm’s challenge
is to determine the relative weight to be given to exploration versus exploitation, and then judiciously select
among potential external partners in order to benefit
from the diverse explore and exploit capabilities of these
entities.
There has been substantial growth in all types
of cross-boundary research alliances—firm–firm,
firm–university, or firm–government laboratory—in the
recent past. Firms vary, however, both in the degree to

<-----Page 1----->J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

which they engage in R&D alliances and the nature of the
activities pursued in these alliances (Arora et al., 2001;
Rosenfeld, 1996; Link, 1996; Koza and Lewin, 1998).2
Some alliances focus on exploitation—incrementally
building on the firm’s existing internal knowledge
with an external partner’s specific capabilities. Other
alliances emphasize exploration—tapping external
knowledge to aid in investigating trajectories that are
new to the firm (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001; Ahuja,
2000). In general, when selecting external partners,
firms appear to value diversity for exploration and
complementarity for exploitation.
Prior research on cross-boundary alliances focuses
mainly on inter-firm alliances (Arora et al., 2001;
Rosenfeld, 1996). Although the literature mentions universities as strategic research partners, it does not delve
deeply into the unique character of university–firm
alliances and tends to investigate these alliances from
the perspective of the university, rather than from the
perspective of the commercial partner. When universities
are considered as strategic partners, the focus is typically
on start-up firms, not the large corporations that account
for three-quarters of R&D funding in the economy
and fund the majority of industry-sponsored research
conducted at academic institutions. Moreover, the typical conceptualization of innovation, the linear model,
places universities at the earliest stage of knowledge
creation and upstream from firms’ more applied R&D
(Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004). Yet, in practice, university research involves a rich mix of scientific discovery,
clinical trials, beta testing, and prototype development.
While many university breakthroughs address fundamental scientific questions, they may simultaneously
provide practical implications for current commercial
products (Stokes, 1997). The university–firm dyad is
a particularly unique mechanism for cross-boundary
learning for firms as universities operate with different
incentives, goals, routines, decision-making structures
than for-profit entities. An open question is if, or how,
the balance a firm maintains with the R&D conducted
in-house influences the firm’s proclivity to pursue external alliances in general, and university-based alliances
in particular.
The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of university–firm research alliances and the
role these alliances play in the R&D efforts of large,
2 The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF, 2001, p. A4-73) estimates that the percentage of funds spent on R&D alliances was 6.3%
compared to what was spent in-house for all industries. The range was
from 13.4% for chemicals (NAICS 31–33) to 0.3% for computer and
electronic products (NAICS 334).

research-intensive firms. One key question is how a
firm’s innovation strategy, in terms of both internal focus
and internal organization, influences the decision to
engage in R&D alliances with universities. Drawing on
previous research in innovation and learning, we develop
a set of predictions that link firms’ internal innovation
strategy and internal R&D organization to the level of
involvement and the intensity of the R&D relationship
firms maintain with universities (March, 1991; Levinthal
and March, 1993; Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Argyres
and Silverman, 2004). We argue that firms pursuing
internal R&D strategies more heavily weighted toward
exploratory activities and those firms with more centralized internal R&D organizations will make greater
use of exploratory university-based research alliances
and engage in more multifaceted relationships. We test
our predictions with original data drawn from a survey of executives at R&D-intensive firms in Canada.
Our empirical analysis confirms that universities are
preferred as partners when firm’s internal R&D strategy emphasizes exploration and the development of new
capabilities. In contrast to other external partners, universities are preferred when the firm’s R&D strategy
emphasizes long-term exploratory projects and when it
perceives potential problems protecting the knowledge
created through the alliance.
The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the concepts of exploration and
exploitation particularly in the context of university–firm
alliances. In the third section, we develop four predictions linking firm R&D strategy and internal R&D
organization with the degree of university research activity. We also consider factors that may influence the
relative use of university-based alliances as compared
to other cross-boundary alliances by innovating firms.
The fourth section of this paper describes our data and
methodology. Empirical results are presented in the fifth
section. Conclusions and suggestions for further research
are offered in the sixth section.
1. Exploration, exploitation, and
university-based alliances
Innovation is the ability to create economic value
from new ideas and the pursuit of innovation requires
firms to define a strategy.3 A central concern in designing an innovation strategy is the balance between the

the management of innovation and the management of technology.

organizational context for producing successful products and processes

exploration of new ideas and the exploitation of existing competencies and well-developed expertise (March,
1991). To be precise, R&D can be characterized as
either explorative or exploitive, where exploration spurs
new discoveries, while exploitation refines current capabilities. A second dimension concerns the sourcing of
useful knowledge and the most basic dichotomy is
either internal or external to the firm. While the majority of R&D is done internally, external R&D alliances
are important because critical knowledge and resources
for both exploration and exploitation reside in diverse
organizations, such as upstream suppliers, downstream
customers, academic institutions, and national laboratories (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Our focus is on the use of
universities as strategic external R&D partners. This section of the paper details the key concepts of exploitation
and exploration and considers how firms may pursue
each of these goals internally or via university-based
alliances.
Both exploration and exploitation are essential for
organizational learning; however, these activities compete for scarce resources. Firm strategy involves finding
a balance that simultaneously allows for organization
survival and the generation of competitive advantage
(Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). Indeed, Levinthal and
March (1993, p. 105) note that, “The basic problem
confronting an organization is to engage in sufficient
exploitation to ensure its current viability and, at the
same time, to devote enough energy to exploration to
ensure its future viability. Survival requires a balance,
and the precise mix of exploitation and exploration that
is optimal is hard to specify.” Differences in the balance
of explore and exploit between firms in the same industry
is the essence of innovation strategy and may contribute
to observed differences in performance.
Exploitation represents the refinement, extension, and
intelligent use of existing competencies (March, 1991;
Levinthal and March, 1993). R&D activities focused
on exploitation are typically incremental and shorter
term in orientation. Empirical evidence suggests that
the majority of industrial R&D is exploitative in character with approximately 75% allocated to development
activities, 20% committed to applied research, and only
5% targeting basic research (NSF, 2001).4 Most inter-

while economizing on time and resources. In contrast, the management
of technology focuses on the capabilities underlying the portfolio of
existing and prospective technologies.
4 It is important to recognize that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between basic research and exploration and applied R&D and
exploitation. Basic research asks fundamental questions, without direct
concern about practical applications and encompasses experimental or

nal R&D is capabilities deepening as in-house R&D
departments concentrate on fine-tuning existing products
and processes, or coming up with model enhancements (Argyres, 1996). For example, Henderson and
Clark (1990, pp. 24–27) provide an in-depth analysis of
Kasper Instrument’s internal R&D focus on incremental
improvements and extensions to their existing product
line. Helfat (1994) documents the highly applied and
firm-specific nature of R&D activity in the petroleum
industry. Of course, an incremental R&D strategy aimed
at exploitation allows firms to make the optimal use of
existing complementary assets (Helfat, 1997).
Some cross-boundary alliances are formed specifically to exploit an existing capability of the firm and,
in this sense, complement and extend the firm’s internal R&D activities (Koza and Lewin, 1998; Rothaermel
and Deeds, 2004). External partners may provide costeffective access to specialized resources needed for
incremental innovations. These resources may be so
highly specialized that it is costly or impractical to
bring them under the corporate umbrella. For example, when entering a market in a new country a firm
may partner with a local firm that understands local customers and can successfully adapt an existing product for
greater local market acceptance. Alternatively, a medical device firm may contract out prototype production
to specialized design firms that refine their products for
better customer acceptance and easier manufacturability. These cross-boundary alliances give a firm access to
knowledge that differs from, but can complement, their
existing technology activities.
Exploitation-based alliances with university partners
are surprisingly common. In a survey of industrial R&D
managers, Cohen et al. (2002a,b) find that more than
one-third of their respondent firms use public research
to address existing problems, suggesting the benefit of
universities to assist the firm’s ability to exploit existing
capabilities. For example, a paper company that we interviewed sponsored a university-based project to optimize
their current process of removing contaminants from
recycled paper. Similarly, the pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly sponsors academic research to improve
its existing product line in insulin. For the university,
the research creates knowledge that provides new findings and potential scientific breakthroughs. However, for
the firm, this knowledge improves an existing product
line that allows it to better deploy its existing capabil-

theoretical work. Applied research focuses on specific applications
with a direct concern for using the results. Applied R&D may advance
the findings of basic research towards some commercial object.

<-----Page 3----->J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

ities and increase its market share in a known product
space. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms regularly
engage in sponsored research agreements with universities having strong medical schools and hospitals to
conduct clinical trials and analyze trial data of drugs
developed in-house. This phenomenon extends broadly
across industrial sectors: Feller et al. (2002, p. 465) report
that 63% of the companies that participated in Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) received direct technical
assistance from university researchers.
Exploration refers to the search, discovery, and development of knowledge that is new to a firm (March, 1991;
Levinthal and March, 1993). The returns to exploratory
R&D are “uncertain, distant, and often negative” (March,
1991, p. 85). Exploration is associated with capabilitiesbroadening activities in which innovation arises from
the synthesis of distinct streams of knowledge (Argyres,
1996). Often driven by dissatisfaction with current performance, firms may shift the R&D balance toward
more experimental projects to search for new ideas and
new technologies that may be successfully commercialized (Holmqvist, 2004). As exploration generates
the potential for exploitation, many firms recognize the
importance of conducting some exploratory research
in-house (Cohen, 1994; Tripsis and Gavetti, 2000). Internal exploratory activities include long-term projects to
develop new capabilities and new product platforms.
Well-known examples of firms that have conducted
exploratory research internally include Xerox with Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC), AT&T with Bell Labs,
IBM, and 3M. The other face of this strategy is that
firms that invest R&D resources on exploration internally develop absorptive capacity, the ability to “identify,
assimilate and exploit knowledge from the environment”
(Cohen and Levinthal, 1989, p. 569). A firm’s investment in internal exploration positions it to act on new
discoveries from external sources.
Linking with external entities has been shown to
be a key element of successful exploration strategies (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001; Von Hippel, 1988;
Mowery et al., 1996). Competitors, upstream suppliers or
downstream customers, as well as national laboratories,
and academic institutions are potential R&D alliance
partners (Leonard-Barton, 1995). These cross-boundary
alliances provide access to knowledge currently not
existing within the firm (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998;
Dussauge et al., 2000). The integration of new external knowledge extends the firm’s technology portfolio
and may lead to path-breaking innovation (Nagarajan
and Mitchell, 1998; Ahuja, 2000).
Many firm–university alliances are exploratory in
character, as demonstrated by Table 1. Universities have

long served as a source of foundational scientific and
technical knowledge; however, the discovery of breakthroughs with significant commercial potential such as
biotechnology, computer science, material science, and
nanotechnology is driving increased industry sponsorship of university research (Geuna, 1999; Mowery et
al., 2001). In interviews, firms reported that they fund
university projects in order to tap academic experts and
to enhance the technological vitality of the company’s
projects. In a survey of R&D managers, Mansfield (1998)
found that, in the absence of academic research, approximately 14% of new product introductions in seven
industries would not have been developed without substantial time delay. In addition, firms fund research at
universities to promote experimentation and to investigate new research directions. For example, General
Motors Corporation funds university research projects
on hydrogen fuel cells and related technologies at different universities in order to develop capabilities in this
technology and explore the possible introduction of new
product. Of course, simultaneously General Motors is
also devoting internal resources to absorb and extend
this knowledge.
In addition to research type, university–industry
interactions may differ in terms of level of ongoing
involvement. A firm’s R&D alliances with universities
may involve either single transactions such as individual
projects, or in-depth long-term relationships as another
part of R&D strategy. Single transactions are common
for university research results that are basically “ready
to use” (Colyvas et al., 2002). A company may have a
research target in mind and then transact with a number
of different universities in order to create a portfolio of
ideas. For example, the company AbioMed is developing an artificial heart, and their product prototype blends
elements from research projects at a variety of different universities. Their objective is to define a unique
product and their strategy is to vet multiple potential
sources of technology. In this case, the firm may allocate
a significant portion of their budget to university-based
projects, but because these resources are spread across

<-----Page 4----->934

J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

many research teams, the overall mode of interaction is
more transactional than relational in character.
In contrast, relationships are bundles of linked transactions. For example, relationships exist when a firm
engages in several activities such as funding multiple
sponsored research projects, hiring graduate students,
participating in research centers, and providing endowment funding. A commonly seen example occurs when
a firm has strong ties to a particular faculty member,
funds numerous open-ended projects, licenses the resulting inventions, and then hires the graduate students that
worked in the professor’s laboratory. In other instances,
firms that are leaders in certain technologies may make
long-term commitments to universities that have related
strong expertise such as the Bell Labs Project at the
University of Toronto. Another example occurs when a
company establishes close ties to a university through an
alumni connection. An example would be the Wallace H.
Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech University which has numerous links with the
Coulter Corporation, a manufacturer of medical devices
and diagnostics, and the associated non-profit Coulter
Foundation.
2. Firm’s R&D strategy and university research
The balance between the exploration of new capabilities and the exploitation of existing capabilities
differentiates the innovation strategies of firms. Moreover, firms are heterogeneous in the ways they organize
their R&D activities. In this section, we develop a set
of predictions to explore how firm’s R&D strategy and
structure may influence the university–industry R&D
interface. We focus on the subset of university-based
alliances first, addressing the overarching question as to
when university-based alliances are the preferred vehicle for tapping external knowledge as compared to other
types of external alliances in the final part of this section.
2.1. Firm strategy and university interactions
Consider two firms, one in which the majority of
internal research is exploitative and another that places
much greater emphasis on exploration internally. Which
firm would be more likely to seek university partners
for an exploration-focused alliance? One strand of the
literature on university–firm alliances contends that a
division of innovative labor is common and suggests
that university–firm interactions are driven, to a large
extent, by the need to “trade in knowledge and technologies between those sectors with complementary
comparative advantages at different points in the inno-

vation process” (Graff et al., 2002, p. 95). Given that
university researchers are the largest performers of basic
research, while the majority of applied and developmental research is conducted in industrial laboratories, this
perspective implies that firms with greater emphasis on
exploitation activities would be most apt to partner with
university players.
The research on search, absorptive capacity, and organizational learning, on the contrary, implies that pursuing
university interactions to tap such expertise is likely to
be more highly valued by firms with innovation strategies that emphasize exploration (Cyert and March, 1963;
March, 1991; Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). First, exploration is aided by variation and diversity (March, 1991).
As such, a firm with significant internal investments in
exploratory activities may seek to enhance this investment by accessing external sources of variation. Both
universities and other firms in the value chain (supplier,
buyer, or competitor) may hold knowledge that is distinct from the knowledge or capabilities of the focal firm.
However, it is possible that there will be substantial overlap in the knowledge base of the firm and the knowledge
base of others in its value chain as these entities operate
in the shadow of the same dominant industry technology
paradigm. The university players, on the other hand, are
somewhat isolated from competitive demands and thus
may search more broadly and subsequently offer a more
unique set of know-how. Academic researchers, in particular, perform a great deal of foundational research.
The new knowledge generated by university research
may provide important breakthroughs with longer-term
commercial potential (Rosenberg and Nelson, 1994).
The attractiveness of universities as research partners is
further enhanced if, as Greve and Taylor (2000) argue,
the innovations of competitors catalyze firms to widen
their search in a non-mimetic response.
Second, firms with little internal exploration will
be poorly positioned to either recognize or assimilate
knowledge generated externally as compared to firms
that are actively generating new and diverse knowhow internally (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). A firm’s
investment in internal exploration builds absorptive
capacity that positions the firm to take advantage of
cross-boundary exploratory alliances. The need to invest
in generating absorptive capacity is particularly acute
when tapping university-based resources. As Cohen and
Levinthal (1990, p. 140) note, “When outside knowledge is less targeted to the firm’s particular needs and
concerns, a firm’s own R&D becomes more important
in permitting it to recognize the value of knowledge,
assimilate and exploit it. Sources that produce less targeted knowledge would include university labs involved

<-----Page 5----->J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

in basic research, while more targeted knowledge may be
generated by contract research labs, or input suppliers.”
The organizational learning literature links internal
exploratory activity to increases in a firm’s valuing
of variation and development of absorptive capacity.
There is an implied complementarity between internal exploration and the use of university exploratory
research. This suggests that the greater the proportion
of its internal R&D expenditures that a firm allocates to
exploratory projects, the greater will be the share of its
total research budget allocated to exploratory universitybased research projects.
The mode of external interactions is also believed
to be influenced by firm’s innovation strategy.
Our interviews with firm’s R&D executives, university technology-transfer officials, and others involved
in the university–industry interface suggest that
university–firm interactions can be roughly segregated
into two categories: transactions and relationships.5
Transactions are arms-length, limited agreements. For
example, the stand-alone license of a university invention
that is not linked to either previous research sponsored by
the firm or an ongoing faculty-consulting contract would
constitute a transaction. In contrast, longer term, bundles of multiple transactions represent relationships. Two
attributes, stage of technology development and ease of
knowledge transfer, are believed to interact to affect the
choice of either a transaction or relationship interaction mode. In general, early stage technologies require
more extensive research investment to reach commercial
viability. The likely need for follow-on research suggests that relationships will be required in early stage,
exploratory projects (Thursby and Thursby, 2004). Turnkey transactions or arms-length contracts may be viable,
however, with exploitative research that focuses on more
incremental technological advances or proof of concept projects. Further, while the transfer of knowledge
across organizational boundaries is always challenging,
the challenge is intensified when the recipient has limited
direct experience with the technology to be transferred
(Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). As Mowery and Rosenberg
(1989, p. 7) note, “a new technology is a complex mix
of codified data and poorly defined “know-how.” The
successful transfer of the tacit component of this new
knowledge generally requires close and ongoing interactions between the inventor and the purchaser (Teece,
1985; Kogut, 1988; Levin et al., 1987). For example,
Thursby and Thursby (2004) find that an estimated 40%

5

Other researchers have alluded to this distinction (Colyvas et al.,
2002; Feller, 1990; Duysters and Man, 2003; Shane, 2002).

935

of the inventions licensed from universities could not be
commercialized without ongoing faculty involvement.
Relationships provide partner-specific absorptive capacity that increases the ability to recognize and assimilate
knowledge for a particular partner (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Mowery et al., 1996). Such knowledge develops informally over time as individuals within the allied
organizations get to know one another and understand
how to best work together.
Exploratory research, by definition, is concerned with
the development of new knowledge, defined as knowledge or technology that differs substantially from the
knowledge base held by the firm. The need for additional
development and hands-on transfer of substantially
new knowledge implies multiple transactions. Type of
research arguably has a significant role in determining
type of interaction maintained. In this respect, how the
firm allocates its university-based expenditures between
exploratory projects and exploitation projects should be
related to the depth of the relationship. This suggests
that the greater the proportion of external academic R&D
expenditures the firm allocates to exploratory projects,
the more it will use relational-based interaction modes
with universities.
2.2. Firm’s R&D organization and university
interactions
Firms also have different ways of organizing internal
R&D that may further affect interactions with universities. In some firms, the R&D function is centralized
with all research coordinated through a small number
of linked R&D units that report directly to a corporatelevel executive. In other firms, the R&D organization
is decentralized with research activities conducted by
rather autonomous divisions of the firm, often in geographically disparate locations. Yet other firms operate
with a hybrid structure that melds the other two organizational modes. In practice, we observe that companies
are differentiated by the centrality of the control and
coordination in organizing their R&D (Gassman and
von Zedtwitz, 1999). These alternative organizational
forms certainly have differing competencies and as such
may lead to, and support, different research strategies
(Argyres, 1995, 1996; Feller et al., 2002).
However, to date there has been little empirical examination of the organization of R&D. The incentive and
coordination attributes of centralized R&D are believed
to support longer-term capabilities-broadening research
(Argyres and Silverman, 2004). Generally organized as
cost centers, centralized R&D units are shielded to some
degree from immediate market pressures. Centralized

<-----Page 6----->936

J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

R&D units operate under the broader mission of innovating so as to improve the long-term performance of the
firm as a whole. Concomitant with this broader mission
is greater discretion in the selection of both the problem
to be solved and the approach for solving the identified technological challenges. In addition, centralized
structures serve as knowledge repositories integrating
and coordinating information acquired across the firm’s
product-lines. Christensen (2002) argues that corporations with central coordination are more likely to engage
in synergistic activities focusing on upstream relationship involving science-based R&D.
In contrast, decentralized structures may excel in the
pursuit of incremental improvement. A decentralized
R&D operation will typically have incentives that are
more closely tied to immediate outcomes. Specifically, in
decentralized facilitates, R&D personnel operate closer
to the marketplace and are assumed to have a better
understanding of customer needs and product performance (Jensen and Meckling, 1992). This motivates
capabilities-deepening research efforts that are directly
linked to the goals of increasing demand and market
share (Kay, 1988). The broader focus, greater decisionmaking authority, and more diverse knowledge base of
the centralized R&D unit favor exploratory research.
Given our previous arguments that link external alliances
with exploratory research, we expect that firms with
more centralized R&D organizations will allocate a
greater percentage of their budget to exploratory university research.
A firm’s internal R&D organization may also reflect
the manner in which the firm interacts with its university partners. With respect to internal organization,
the propensity to form relationships as opposed to
engaging in transactions is believed to depend on
two factors—recognition of potential research synergies across projects and allocation of decision-making
authority. With respect to the first factor, the broader
focus and more diverse knowledge base of the centralized R&D unit enhances a firm’s ability to bring
together and evaluate disparate pieces of information
(Argyres and Silverman, 2004). As such, a centralized
R&D organization should be more likely to recognize
situations where it is rational to build relationships by
linking or extending existing university–firm transactions. BASF, a company noted to have one of the most
administratively centralized R&D operations of European chemical companies, provides an example of such
relationship building. The company recently announced
the opening of a research laboratory at the Institut
de Science et d’Ingenierie Supramoleculaires (ISIS),
Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France (Milmo,

2003). The focus will be on developing novel nanostructured polymer materials with the stated goal of
linking its R&D activities to cutting edge academic
research. Centralized organizations in general, and centralized R&D organizations in particular, have the further
advantage of operating with definitive decision-making
authority (Williamson, 1991). With decentralized R&D,
potentially costly cross-laboratory negotiations would
be required to allocate financial contributions and determine the terms of any add-on sponsored research projects
or subsequent licenses. This favors transactions rather
than relationships. Thus, it seems likely that firms with
more centralized R&D organizations will make more use
of relational-based interaction modes than their decentralized counterparts.
2.3. Universities as preferred exploratory partners
A background question concerns the fundamental
reasons why firms choose to partner with universities.
Given the variety of available external partners, what
is unique about universities and why do firms chose
research alliances with universities over alliances with
other firms? Universities, because they have limited
incentives to act opportunistically, may be preferred as
research partners when firms face appropriability concerns.
It is well known that firms are not able to fully appropriate the value of the knowledge created through their
R&D investments. The decision to engage in R&D partnerships heightens this appropriation challenge. While a
collaborative research endeavor may enhance the potential for discovery, it also enhances the potential for a
loss of control over the intellectual property generated
as the outcome of joint research is often known to, and
subsequently claimed by, both parties. This challenge is
particularly salient in firm-to-firm alliances as research
partners who hold complementary assets are in an advantaged position to exploit potential commercial value. In
the worse case, a commercial partner could act opportunistically withholding and/or skewing data in order to
independently file for a patent after the project is complete.
Firms that have strong concerns about the loss of control over intellectual property may choose not to engage
in external alliances, instead concentrating their R&D
efforts internally. Of course, this is an extreme strategy that limits the firm’s access to external knowledge.
The best strategy may be to seek external alliances that
minimize the potential loss of intellectual property. For
exploitation projects contractual rights may be negotiated if the results are more easily determined in advance.

<-----Page 7----->J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

The uncertainty associated with exploratory research
makes it very difficult to specify and price property rights
ex ante as the intellectual property does not yet exist
(Mowery and Rosenberg, 1989).
Universities are in a unique position as R&D partners. Not only are universities a source of exploratory
research but they also lack the complementary assets to
compete directly in commercial markets. While universities have recently asserted their rights to ownership of
intellectual property, the emphasis on making profits are
much weaker for universities than for firms and a minor
objective compared to the university’s primary functions of education, research, and service. Concerns about
universities behaving opportunistically with intellectual
property can be addressed contractually: the firm may
either be granted the rights to any intellectual property
developed during the research project or the university
may retain intellectual property ownership. If the university retains ownership then the industry partner is
routinely given the right of first refusal to negotiate a
license. Universities have an interest in licensing any
subsequent intellectual property developed that extend
the research because licenses are their primary means
for creating economic returns from the generation of new
ideas (Shane, 2004).
At first glance, it may appear that university alliances
would be leaky. After all, publishing research findings is critical for academic advancement. However,
research contracts with industry typically contain standard clauses that provide firms with pre-publication
review and the potential to delay publication for a limited period of time in order to secure intellectual property
rights. In addition, the material published in scientific
journals is abstract and seeks to advance the academic literature rather than provide direct commercial relevance.
Only firms that have made the requisite investments in
absorptive capacity will be in a position to potentially
benefit. Moreover, to the extent that the knowledge created in the research project has a tacit component, the
firm that contracted for the research will be advantaged
in realizing its commercial potential.
While we may debate specific cases, it seems that
universities, because of their mission, limited market
presence and lack of complementary assets, offer an
advantage to firms in appropriating joint research project
results, particularly for projects involving exploratory
research. Thus, we expect that universities may be preferred research partners when firms have concerns about
appropriating the returns to cross-boundary research.
The next section presents the data and empirical
model that we employ to examine the relationship
between firm strategy and university research alliances.

3. Empirical analysis: data and methods
Data for this study was collected via a Web-based survey during the summer and fall of 2004. We contacted
R&D executives at each company included in Research
Infosource Inc.’s, Canada’s 100 Top Corporate R&D
Spenders List 2003. Though the population from which
the sample is drawn is small, we chose not to extend
our sampling frame as the amount of R&D expenditures
dropped significantly for companies below this cut-off
point. A cover letter sent to these individuals explained
that the purpose of the survey was to gain an understanding of the firm’s perspective on working with universities
in R&D activities and to assess how university interactions compare to other forms of R&D outsourcing
employed by the firm. The survey instrument was created based on in-depth interviews with industry R&D
professionals and university technology transfer personnel. The instrument incorporated the language of the
informants, drawing upon their knowledge in order to
elicit responses that accurately reflect the organization’s
viewpoint (Campbell, 1955). The survey required about
20 min to complete, and began by asking respondents
to verify information collected about their company
from data available from CompuStat. The respondents
were guaranteed anonymity of their responses and were
offered a summary report in exchange for their participation.
Forty-nine individuals responded to the survey. After
omitting those surveys with incomplete or unusable
responses, our sample totals 45, giving us an effective response rate of 45%. In all cases, respondents
were asked if they had the information required to
complete the questionnaire or to refer the questionnaire to the individual in the corporation who would
have the appropriate information. As a group, the
respondents were highly experienced R&D professionals with two-thirds of the respondents reporting
directly to Board level executives. The majority of the
respondents held the rank of Vice President (27 or
60%) with titles such as VP–Technology & Innovation, VP–Research & Development, or VP–Business
Development. Another 11 (24%) of the respondents
held positions at the rank of Director or Associate Director with titles such as Director–Technology
Development, Director–External R&D Partnerships, or
Director–Research & Development. Six respondents
(13%) were in upper management with titles like
Manager–Research Initiatives, or Manager–Strategic
Innovation. The remaining respondent was from Media
Relations. One issue to examine is that positional
level of the respondent may influence the questionnaire

<-----Page 8----->938

J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

responses. We will address this concern in our empirical
results.
Non-response bias was considered by comparing
early (first 75%) to late (last 25%) responses (Armstrong
and Overton, 1977). Independent sample t-tests of
dependent and independent variables indicated no statistically significant differences between the early and
late responses. As a further test of non-response bias,
we compared the CompuStat data on revenue and R&D
spending of the companies that responded with those that
did not respond. Again, independent sample t-tests confirm that there are no statistically significant differences
between the two groups on these dimensions.
Table 2 summarizes the variables and provides their
operational definitions. We now describe how the variables are constructed.
3.1. Dependent variables
Our first dependent variable, University-based Exploration, is measured as the average percentage of the
firm’s total R&D expenditures that was allocated to
exploratory research conducted at universities or other
academic institutions over a 3-year period (2001–2003).
Firms were asked to report the internal allocation of
their R&D budget among exploration and exploitation,
using definition from March (1991). Next, we asked
about the extent of external alliances for universities and
others. Respondents were then asked to allocate external R&D to explore/exploit by type of external partner.
We find that, on average, firms in the sample commit
approximately six and one-half percent of their R&D
budget to university-based projects, with approximately
two-thirds of this six and one-half percent going to
exploratory projects and one-third committed to projects
with an exploitation focus.
Our second dependent variable, Mode of Interaction,
seeks to capture the depth of the firm’s interactions with
universities. Using a five-point Likert scale, we asked
respondents to rate the average depth of their firm’s relationships with universities over the past 3 years with
a rating of 1 corresponding to “only limited, armslength transactions” and a rating of 5 corresponding to
“on-going, multifaceted relationships.” Recognizing the
firms may use a combination of transactions and relationships, responses covered the full range of 1–5, with
an average response of 2.82.
To explore when universities are preferred alliance
partners, we create two additional dependent variables.
The first, External Exploration Comparison, is calculated
as the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated to universities for exploratory research projects

the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated to universities for exploitative research projects
minus the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated to other external partners for exploitative
research.
3.2. Independent variables
Two key independent variables in this study relate to
the firm’s innovation strategy. A central component of a
firm’s innovation strategy is the relative emphasis placed
on exploration versus exploitation. To measure this distribution, each respondent was asked to specify the percentage of R&D dollars committed to exploration—the
search, discovery, and development of new knowledge
and products and alternatively the percentage of R&D
dollars earmarked for exploitation—the refinement and
extension of firm’s existing competencies and products,
for their firm’s internal R&D, university-based R&D,
and other externally conducted R&D. Two innovation
strategy variables are derived from the data provided.
First, the variable Percent Internal Exploration is the
overall share of the firm’s internal R&D expenditures
allocated to exploratory activities. On average, the firms
in our sample maintain a 36:64% balance between exploration and exploitation for research conducted in-house.
A second, more focused measure of the firm’s universitybased innovation strategy is Percent University Exploration, a variable that captures the percentage of the
firm’s research budget that is allocated to projects with
universities which the firm designates as exploratory.
The two other theory-driven independent variables
capture aspects of the firm’s R&D organization. The first
variable, structure, provides a measure of the firm’s internal R&D configuration. R&D organizations can be (1)

939

highly centralized with the majority of all research conducted at a small number of R&D laboratories, (2) highly
decentralized with R&D taking place at a large number
of facilities, or (3) a hybrid mix conducting significant
operations in a moderate number of locations (Argyres
and Silverman, 2004; IRI, 1995). Our structure measure
is calculated as a Herfindahl concentration index based
on the distribution of research activities across internal
laboratories:

Si2
Structure =
i

where Si is the share of total company R&D expenditures
accounted for by location i. Respondents were asked to
list their R&D facilities and note the share of R&D conducted at each facility. The higher the value of structure,
the more centralized the company’s R&D organization.
The second organization variable, authority, reflects
R&D decision-making autonomy within the firm.
Decision-making authority was identified using two
items querying the degree of discretion the laboratory
was allowed in (1) choosing technology focus and (2)
selecting specific research projects within a technical
area. Responses were based on a Likert scale from 1 to
5, with 1 corresponding to “no discretion” and 5 to “total
discretion.” The scale reliability coefficient for this set
of items is 0.71.
Finally, to test questions of external partner selection, we employ data from the Carnegie Mellon Survey
(Cohen et al., 2000) that details the perceived effectiveness of patents as an appropriability mechanism for
product and process innovations. Using data at the threedigit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industry,
Cohen et al (2000, pp. 5–6) provide a “response scale
(that) reflects how central a mechanism is to firms’ strategies of appropriating rents to their innovations in the
sense that it reflects both the frequency with which a
mechanism is employed and the effectiveness of that
mechanism given its use.” We assigned the 45 firms in our
sample to their three-digit industry, resulting in 16 unique
industries.6 Since exploratory R&D covers the spectrum
of outcomes, our measure of patent effectiveness is constructed as averages of the reported effectiveness values
with respect to product and process innovation.
3.3. Control variables
We control for industry effects using dummy variables for the following sectors—pharmaceutical/bio6

Industry dummy variables are assigned at the more aggregate twodigit SIC level.

<-----Page 10----->940

J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

technology (9 companies), communication/telecom
equipment (10 companies), electronics (8 companies),
energy (6 companies), and minerals/mining (6 companies) with miscellaneous (6 companies) as the omitted
category. The distribution of industries in our sample
closely mirrors the population of top 100 R&D performers in Canada.
Though all of the firms in our sample are among
the top 100 corporate R&D spenders in Canada, there
are still significant differences in the R&D expenditure among firms. We control for these differences
in R&D spending via two variables. The first, calculated as log of average total R&D dollars spent by
the firm in 2001–2003, provides a direct measure of
R&D budget. The second measures Relative R&D Intensity and is calculated as the difference between firm
R&D ratio (R&D dollars/sales) and industry average
R&D ratio normalized by the industry average R&D
ratio. We also control for firm size using the log of
sales.
Finally, when estimating mode of interaction, we also
control for the total share of the firm’s R&D budget allocated to university-based research (explore and exploit).
This allows us to investigate whether type of research
has a significant role in determining mode of interaction maintained independent of the firm’s overall level
of involvement in university-based research, using the
following models:
Mode of Interaction = β0 + β1 Percent University
Exploratory + β2 Structure + β3 Decision-making
Authority + β4 R&D Dollars + β5 Relative R&D
Intensity + β6 Sales + β7 Pharm/Biotech
+β8 Comm/Telecom Equipment
+β9 Electronics + β10 Mining+β11 Energy
+β12 Total University Share + εi
Appropriability issues are examined using the following model:

+β10 Mining + β11 Energy
+β12 Average Patent Effectiveness + εi
Table 3 displays summary statistics and correlation
coefficients for each of the variables. Correlations are
generally low to moderate. Given that the first two
dependent variables are bounded—level of involvement
between 0 and 1 and mode of interaction between 1
and 5—the two-sided Tobit estimation model is used for
the analysis of these models.7 The models examining
appropriability issues are estimated using OLS.
4. Results
Table 4 reports the results of the Tobit estimation.
University-based exploration is the dependent variable
in Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1 contains just the control variables, of which only one shows significance. Not
surprisingly, we find that pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms are more likely than firms in other industries
to allocate a considerable share of their R&D budget
to university-based exploration (p < 0.05). This result
is consistent with results from the Yale and Carnegie
Mellon industrial R&D surveys (Cohen et al., 2002a,b;
Klevorick et al., 1995) as well as other studies of innovation networks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries (Powell et al., 1996; Zucker et al., 2002).
Model 2 incorporates the three primary covariates
capturing firm innovation strategy and R&D organization: Percent Internal Exploration, Structure, and
Decision-making Authority. The explanatory power of
the model increases significantly with the addition of
the independent variables of theoretical interest. A likelihood ratio test comparing Model 2 with Model 1 is
significant with a p-value of less than 0.01. The coefficient on Percent Internal Exploration is positive and
significant (p < 0.01), indicating that the greater proportion of internal R&D expenditures the firm allocates to
exploratory projects, the greater will also be the share
of its total research budget allocated to exploratory
university research. Firms with internal innovation
strategies more heavily weighted toward exploratory
activities allocate a greater share of their R&D dollars

As a robustness check, we also estimated the main models using
OLS rather than Tobit. In all cases, the signs on the coefficients are
consistent, though we do see a slight reduction in significance for some
of the independent variables. We also ran the VIF procedure following
the OLS regression. In no case was multicollineraity an issue. For
Model 2, the mean VIF was 2.20 with the highest value on any one
variable 2.73. Similarly, for Model 4, the mean VIF was 2.31 with the
highest value on any one variable 3.55.

Two-tailed tests for controls, one-tailed tests for variables of interest.

to exploratory research conducted at universities. These
cross-boundary research relationships appear to be an
important means for linking to sources of new knowledge. Firms with active exploratory research agendas
in-house are likely to have both an interest in tapping
university-based expertise and to have developed the
absorptive capacity necessary to digest university-based
exploratory research (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). The
marginal effect of a 10% increase in internal exploratory
activity, evaluated at the mean of the independent variables, translates into a 0.5% increase in exploratory
research with universities.
The coefficient for R&D Structure is also positive
and significant at the p < 0.05 level, indicating an important strategy–structure link. Firms with more physically
concentrated R&D configurations have greater levels of
involvement with university-based exploratory research
activities. Having a more centralized R&D organization where a large share of the firm’s research personnel
interact seems to facilitate use of university alliances
for non-local search. The coefficient on the DecisionMaking Authority variable, while positive, does not
reach significance. It does not appear that R&D organizations with greater discretion in the selection of research
paradigms use academic research resources more extensively.

Mode of Interaction is the dependent variable in
the second set of models (Model 3 and Model 4) in
Table 4. Model 3 is the baseline model containing control variables only. Model 4 includes the independent
variables of interest: Percent University Exploration,
R&D Structure, and Decision-making Authority. The
change in the log-likelihood χ2 statistic between Model
3 and Model 4 is significant, with p < 0.05. In Model
4, the coefficient for exploration at universities is positive and significant (p < 0.01). The more a firm uses
its university interactions to pursue exploratory projects,
the more likely these projects will be handled as part
of an ongoing relationship rather than as an armslength transaction. Relationships are believed to be
important for the transfer of tacit knowledge (Dyer and
Singh, 1998). The structure of internal R&D organization and the allocation of decision-making authority
do not appear to influence depth of interaction. There
is some evidence, however, that that Mode of Interaction differs across industry sectors with firms in
the electronics sector having significantly less depth
in their university interactions. This is consistent with
the idea that firms in rapidly changing environments
use more transitory alliances to acquire very specific
knowledge in a swift manner (Duysters and Man,
2003).

When are university-based alliances preferred?.

To test for respondent bias due to the position of the
respondent within the organization, we ran Model 2 and
Model 4 with a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respondent reported directly to a board-level executive and 0
otherwise. The estimations results did not change for
the variables of interest, while the dummy variable on
organization position was not statistically significant. We
verified that multicolinearity was not an issue using the
VIF procedure on OLS versions of these models.
4.1. The uniqueness of universities as external
research partners
The above analyses provide support for the argument
that firms pursuing exploratory R&D strategies in-house
are also likely to fund university-based exploratory
research projects to augment internal search efforts. Universities, however, are not the only external partners that
a firm may tap to gain new knowledge. The question
thus becomes one of selection. Namely, when do firms
prefer to engage in strategic research partnerships with
universities rather than with other (non-academic) external alliances? What is unique about university-based
research partnerships?
Table 5 reports the results for our investigation of partner selection. Our dependent variable for Models 1a–1b,
External Exploration Comparison, is calculated as the
percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated
to universities for exploratory research projects minus
the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allo-

cated to other external partners for exploratory research.
Similarly, our dependent variable for Models 2a–2b,
External Exploitation Comparison, calculated as the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated
to universities for exploitative research projects minus
the percentage of the firm’s total research budget allocated to other external partners for exploitative research.
Models 1a and 2a are the baseline estimations of the
exploration and exploitation comparisons, respectively.
Interestingly, none of the control variables are significant in these two models. Industry sector and/or R&D
levels and intensity do not seem to directly influence
the type of external partner preferred. Models 1b and 2b
add the independent variable of interest—average patent
effectiveness. The coefficient on patent effectiveness is
positive and significant (p < 0.01) when External Exploration Comparison is the dependent variable (Model 1b).
The more effective patents are in protecting product
and process innovations, the greater the use of university alliances for exploratory projects when compared
to the use of other types of cross-boundary alliances.
The coefficient is smaller and just below statistical
significance in the External Exploitation Comparison
Model (Model 2b). The effectiveness of patents does
not lead to a preference for university partners when
projects are exploitative in nature. Much of the literature on cross-boundary alliances suggests that strong
property rights enable firms to make better use of
cross-boundary alliances by reducing appropriability
hazards. It may be that when firms see the potential

<-----Page 14----->944

J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

of economic gains through patent-protected intellectual
property, they seek partners that provide the greatest
assurance that the firm will be able to garner these important rights at a reasonable cost. Further, this assurance
is of greater importance in projects with an exploratory
focus.
5. Discussion and conclusions
The ability to tap external sources of knowledge has
become increasingly important for firms seeking to gain
competitive advantage through innovation. Though academic research institutions have long served as a key
external source of scientific and technical knowledge
for industrial firms, the growing level of activity at the
university–industry interface makes it imperative that we
augment our understanding of how university interactions fit within firms’ broader R&D strategy. This study
investigates the links of firm innovation strategy and
internal R&D structure with the firm’s level and degree
of involvement with university research partners. Consistent with predictions, we find a strong relationship
between firm innovation strategy and firm–university
research interactions. Firms spend a greater share of their
R&D dollars on university-based research projects and
these projects are more likely to be considered part of an
ongoing relationship when the firm is pursing an internal
innovation strategy more heavily weighted toward exploration and when a greater share of the research conducted
at universities is exploratory, respectively. The link found
between firm R&D organization and firm–university
research interactions is somewhat weaker. While a more
centralized R&D function is related to greater involvement with exploratory university-based research, the
depth of these university-based interactions appear to be
independent of the firm’s internal R&D organizational
structure.
This paper also sheds light on the factors that
differentiate university partners from other external
partners. Although firms may leverage all types of
cross-boundary alliances to gain distinct knowledge,
our evidence suggests that universities are preferred
partners when there are concerns about the perceived
ability to fully appropriate the results. This is particularly true for exploration-based projects. Firms that focus
on exploratory research are engaging in a risky, longterm strategy. The firm may be attempting to develop
new platform capabilities and be engaged in a competitive race with significant consequences. As a result,
the firm needs to protect its R&D investment by establishing legal ownership of intellectual property through
patenting (Laursen and Slater, 2005).

The fact that universities have different objectives
from firms may provide unique strategic partnering
opportunities. Notably, in R&D alliances there is the
potential that commercial partners may behave opportunistically, appropriating knowledge created through
the alliance to their own advantage. In contrast, the
fundamental differences between private sector and
university objectives, coupled with the lack of complementary market-oriented assets, limit the risk that
a university research partner may opportunistically
attempt to benefit commercially from the knowledge
created in the alliance. Industry research contracts with
universities typically include the right of first refusal to
license intellectual property resulting from the project
and since licensing is the primary way that universities
derive revenue from their intellectual property, they have
an incentive to negotiate a license. In sum, universities
may be privileged R&D strategic partners for exploration
for large R&D performers.
The results suggest a more nuanced understanding of firm strategy based on the balance of firms’
allocation of R&D funds to exploratory and exploitative efforts and its use of external partners in general
and universities specifically. Our consideration of the
role university-based alliances play in the R&D efforts
of large, research-intensive firms informs the broader
exploration/exploitation literature in three ways. First,
we demonstrate that choice of external partner is explicitly linked to the firm’s internal R&D allocation. Even
after controlling for industry, we find variation in firm
strategies that may be an important source of subsequent
performance heterogeneity. Second, by considering the
perspective of large R&D performers, those firms that
conduct the majority of R&D in any economy, we add
to the burgeoning literature on university-industry relationships. This paper considers strategy at the firm level,
changing the focus from prior studies that examine laboratory managers or R&D directors. Rather than ask
firms to enumerate why they partner with universities,
we provide empirical evidence that firms that focus
on exploration internally and have more centralized
R&D operations make greater use of university research.
Finally, we provide evidence that universities are the
preferred partner when firms are concerned about appropriability. This finding suggests that universities have a
unique role in the system of innovation and larger policy
concerns about industrial competitiveness.
A limitation of this study is the relatively small data
sample which may give rise to concerns about the representativeness of our results. Though small, the current
sample mirrors industry distribution and characteristics
of the population of Canada’s top 100 R&D spenders. A

<-----Page 15----->J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948

mitigating factor of its small size, however, is the unique
content that our data set provides. Through the survey, we
have been able to collect detailed data on firm innovation
strategy, internal R&D organization, and firm–university
interactions that are seldom available from secondary
sources. These data are generally hard to obtain given
the secrecy concerns of firms whose competitive advantage is strongly linked to the competence of their R&D
efforts (Cohen, 1995). Our results suggest that a larger
scale study across different national contexts and across
firms of varying sizes is warranted in order to establish
the generalizability of our findings.
There are other clear opportunities for further
research. Our study shows that the balance between
exploration and exploitation the firm chooses for its
internal research activities is related to the focus of the
firm’s cross-boundary research activities. Causality is
always difficult to establish and it is possible that some
common underlying factor drives both greater internal
exploration and greater use of university exploratory
alliances. Certainly this is a fruitful area for additional
research. The small sample size limits our ability to
run a two-stage model that might clarify this issue.
One other way to untangle issues of causality is to
conduct longitudinal studies. The absorptive capacity
literature highlights the important role of exploration
as a precursor to exploitation (Cohen and Levinthal,
1989, 1990). When successful, exploration can catalyze
performance-enhancing exploitation, which could conceivably lead to a shift in the focus of cross-boundary
research alliances. The explore/exploit literature, on the
other hand, highlights challenges associated with the
“myopia of learning” (Levinthal and March, 1993).
Namely, positive feedback may drive an organization
toward excessive exploration or excessive exploitation,
both of which have the potential to dampen subsequent
performance. In such a situation, the focus of crossboundary alliance may remain static even in the face
of declining performance. The questions of when performance signals will trigger changes in the external
explore/exploit balance and whether these changes will
lead or follow internal changes in this balance merit
study.
Our study also finds a positive relationship between
centralized internal R&D organizations and firm
involvement with exploratory university-based research.
Previous research has shown that R&D organization
may change substantially over time—moving from centralized to decentralized and back again (Argyres and
Silverman, 2004; DeSanctis et al., 2002). A longitudinal
study that investigates how changes in R&D organization
affect the focus of cross-boundary alliances—namely,

945

whether the effect is direct or whether it comes in
response to structurally induced changes of the internal
explore/exploit balance—would also be of interest.
Finally, it would be useful to expand our understanding of the factors that differentiate university
partners from other external alliance partners. The
university–industry technology transfer landscape is
continually changing. Several of our industry respondents mentioned their unease over the increasingly
strong assertion of intellectual property rights by their
university partners. If, as our study suggest, concerns about the ability to appropriate the returns from
cross-boundary research alliances influence the choice
of partner, aggressively claiming ownership over the
resultant intellectual property may decrease relative
desirability of academic partners. Lacking other differentiating factors, firms might shift their resources
to other external partners or to the expansion of internal exploratory efforts. Universities need to understand
whether in their rush to garner immediate economic
returns from industry interactions they may significantly
limit their opportunities in the long term.
