• Shortsighted managements often
fail to recognize that in fact there is
no such thing as a growth industry.

MARKETING MYOPIA
By Theodore Levitt
Every major industry was once a growth industry. But some that arc now riding a wave of
growth enthusiasm are very much in the shadow
ot" decline. Others which are thought of as seasoned growth industries have aetually stopped
growing. In every ease the reason growth is
threatened, slowed, or stopped is not because
the market is saturated. It is because there has
heen a failure ot" management.

Fateful Purposes
The failure is at the top. The executives responsible for it, in the last analysis, are those
\vho deal \vith broad aims and polieies. Thus:
C The railroads did not stop growing because tlie
need for passenger and freight transportation dceh'ned. That grew. The railroads are in trouble
today not because the need was filled by others
(ears, trucks, airplanes, even telephones), but because it was not filled by the railroads themselves.
They let others take eustomers away from them
beeause they assumed themselves to be in the railroad business rather than in the transportation

business. The reason they defined their industry
wrong was beeause they were railroad-oriented instead (if transportation-oriented; they were produetoriented instead of eustomer-oriented.
e Hollywood barely escaped being totally ravished by television. Aetually, all the establisbed
film eompanies went through drastic reorganizations. Some simply disappeared. All of them got
into trouble not because of TV's inroads but beeause of their own myopia. As with the railroads,
Hollywood defined its business ineorreetly. It
thought it was in the movie business when it was
actually in the entertainment business. "Movies"'
implied a specific, limited product. This produeed
a fatuous contentment which from the beginning
led producers to view TV as a threat. HollywootI
seornetl and rejeeted TV when it should have welcomed it as an opportunity — an opportunity to
expand the entertainment business.
Today TV is a bigger business tban the old narrowly defined movie business ever was. Had HolKwood heen customer-oriented (providing entertainment), rather than produet-oriented (making movies), would it have gone through the fiseal purgatory that it did? I doubt it. What ultimately saved
Hollywood and accounted for its recent resurgence
was tbe Ava\e of new young writers, producers,
and directors whose previous successes in television

had decimated the old movie companies and toppled the big movie moguls.
There are other less ob\ious examjiles of industries that have heen and are now endangering
their futures by improperly defining their jiurposes. J shall discuss some in detail later and analyze the kind of policies that lead to trouble.
Right now It may help to show what a thoroughly eustomer-oriented management can do to keep
a growth industry growing, even alter the obvious opportunities have been exhausted; and here
there are two examples that have been around
for a long titne. 1 hey arc nylon and glass —
spceilically, E. I. duPont de Nemours & Company and Corning Class ^\•^)rks:
Both companies ha\e great teelinical eonipctenee.
Their product orientation is untjiicstioiKHl. lUit
this alone does not explain their success. Alter ail,
who A\as more pridefully protlucl-orientetl and
product-conscious tban the erstwliilc Xcw I nglaittl
textile eompanies that ha\e been so thoroughK
massacred? The Dul'onts and the Comings lia\c
succeeded not primarily because of their product
or research orientation but because thc\ lia\i' been
tboroiighK cusLojiier-orieiited also. It is constant
watclifLibiess for ojiportiuiities to apply their teebnical kno\\-liow to the creation of CListumer-satisfying uses whicli accounts for iht'ir prodigious output of SLiccessfiil new iirocliieLs. WMtJioiil a vcr\'
sophisticated eye on tlie custiiincr, most itf tlicir
new protiucts Jiiigbt lia\e been wrong, tlicir sales
niethotls useless.
Aluminum lias also continucti Lo be a growth
industry, thanks to the efforts of two wartimecreated com|ianies which deliberately set about
creating new customer-satisfying uses. \A ithout
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Cx)rporation antl
lUnnolds Metals Company, the total tlcmand for
aluminum toda> would he vastK Jess than it is.

Terror of Analysis
Some may argue that it" is Foolish to set the
railroads off against aluminum or the mo\ ics
olf against glass. Arc not aluminum ami glass
naturally so \ersatile that the industries arc hound
to h a \ c more growth opportunities than the railroads and nn)vies? This view commits prccisciv
the error I have been talkin'^ about, it dclines
an industrv, or a product, or a cluster of knowbow so narrowly as to guarantee its premature
senescence. When we mention "railroads." we
should make sure we mean "transportation."
As transporters, the railroads still have a gooil
chance for \cr\' considerahle growth. 'Tlic\ arc

not limited to tlie raih'oad business as sucli
(though in my opinion rail transportation is
potentially a much stronger transportation medium than is generally hclicvcd).
What the railroads lack is not opportunity,
but some of the same managerial imaginati\eness and audacity that made them great. Vxcn
an amateur like Jacques Barzun can see what is
lacking when he says:
"I gric\e to see t h e most advanced physical and
social organization of the last cenlurx go down in
sliabb\ disgrace for lack of the same eomprebensixe
imagination that built it u|i. j W h a t is lacking is[
tlic \^i\\ of tlie eonipanics Lo s u r \ i \ c and Lo satisfy LIH' public b\ inventiveness and skill."'

Shadow of Obsolescence
It is impossible Lo menLion a single major Industry tbaL did noL at one time qualify f{)r the
magic appcllaLion of "growth industry." In each
case iLs assumed strength lay in the apparentiv
unchallcngcil superiority of iLs product. 'I bere
appeareii to be no cHccLi\e substitute for it. It
was iLself a runaway subsLitulc for the product
it so triumpiiantiy replaced. YcL one after another of tbese celcbraLed indusLries lias conic
under a shadow. LcL us look brieily at a lewmore ol' them. Lhis time taking examples that

How can anybody miss by investing in utilities, with
no eompetition, nothing but growth ahead?
But a second look is not quite so eomforting. A
score of nonutility companies are well advaneed
toward developing a [Xiwerful chemical fuel cell
whieh eould siL in some hidden closet of every
home silently ticking off elceLrie power. The electric lines that vulgarize so many neighborhoods
will be eliniinatcd. So will tbe endless demolition
of streets and service interruptions during storms.
Also on Lhe horizon is solar energ\, again pioneeretl

W^'ho says that Lhe utilities ba\-e no conipeLiLion?
They may be natural monopolies now, huL Loinorrow they may be natural deaLhs. To a\x)id this
prospect, they too will have to develop fuel cells,
solar energy, and other power sources. To survi\e, they themselves will hiwc Lo plot Lhe ol)solescence of what now^ produces their li\t'iiliood.
C Ci-ocery stores — Many people find it hard Lo
realize tbat Lhcre ever was a thriving esLablishment knowii as the "corner grocery store." The
supermarket has taken over wiLli a powerful effectiveness, Yet the big food chains of Lhe 1930's narrowly escaped being eompletely wiped out by the
aggressive expansion of independcnL supermarkets.
1 he first genuine supermarkeL was opened in i 930,
in Jamaiea, Tong Island. Ey 1933 .supermarkets
were thriving in California, Ohio. Pennsylvania,
and elsewhere. VeL Lhe csLablished chains pompously ignored them. A\'hen they cho.se to notice
them, iL was with sueb derisive descriptions as
"eheap>," "horse-and-bugg)," "eracker-liarrel storekeeping." and "unethical opportunists."
The e\ecuLive of' one big chain anjiounced at
Lhe time that he found iL "hard to helieve thaL
people will drive for miles Lo sho|-) for foods and
sacrifice Lhe personal service chains have perfected
and to which Mrs. Consumer is accusLomed." As late as 1936, the NaLional Wholesale Grocers conxenLion and Lhe New Jerse\ BeLail Grocers
Association said there was noLhing to fear. They
said LhaL Lhe supers' narrow ajipeal to Lhe price
bu\er limited Lhe size of their market. They had
to draw from miles aromid. When iniitaLors eame,
there would be wholesale liquidations as volume
fell. Tbe currcnL liigh sales of Lhe supers was said
to be partly due Let their novelty. Easicalh- people
wanted convenient neighborhood grocers. If the
neighborhood stores "cooperate wiLh their suppliers,
pay attention to their costs, and improxe Lhcir service," Lhe\ would be able to weaLher the compeLiLion until it blew over.''
It never blew over. The chains disco\'ercd that
survival required going into the supermarket busi- K(ir more dchiils sc-c M. M. '/Ammcrman, The Super

ness. Tbis meant Lhe Avholesale destruction of their
huge in\esLmenLs in corner sLore sites and in established distribution and nierehandising methods.
Tbe companies ^viLli "the eourage of their convictions" resoluLeh sLiick to Lhe corner store philosophy. They kepL Lheir pride but lost their shirts.

Self-Dctciving Cycle
But memories are short. For example, it is
liard for people who Loday confidently hail the
twin messiahs of electronics and chemicals to
see how things eould possibly go wrong with
these galloping industries. They probably also
cannot see how a reasonably sensible businessman could have been as jn\opic as the famous
Boston millionaire who 50 years ago unintentionally sentenced bis heirs to po\crty by stipulating tbat his entire estate be forever invested
exclusively in electric streetcar .securities, flis
posthumous declaration, "1 here will always be a
big demand for efficient urban transportation,"
is no consolation to his heirs who sustain life by
pumping gasoline at automobile filling stations.
Yet, in a casual sur\cy 1 recently took among
a group of intelligent business executives, nearly
half agreed that it vvould be hard to hurt their
heirs by tying their estates forever to the electronics industry. When I then confronted them
w ith the Boston streetcar example, they chorused
unanimously. "That"s dilFcrent!"' But is it? [s
not the basic situation identical?
In truth, there is no sneh ihln'^ as a growth
industry. 1 bclic\e. There arc only companies
organized and operated to create and capitalize
on growth opportunities. Industries that assume tbemsches to be riding some automatic
growth escalator invariably descend into stagnation. The history of every dead and dying
"growth" industry shows a self-deceiving cycle
of bountiful expansion and undetected decay.
There arc four contliLions which usually guarantee this cycle:
1. The belief Lhat growth is assured by an expantling and more aliluciiL populaLion.
2.

Tbe belief LluU there is no eompetitive substitute for the industry's major product.

3.

'loo much faith in mass production and in
Lhe advanLages of rapidly declining unit
costs as output rises.

4.

nienLation, inipro\cmcnL, and manufacturing cost reiluction.

I shotild like now to begin cxaniiniiT^ each of
these conditions in sonic detail. To build my
case as boldh' as possible, I shall illusLratc the
jioints w itb reference to three iTicUistries —
petroleum, aut()m(»biles, and electronics - - |:>articulariy jictrolcum. because it spans more u'ars
and more \ieissitudcs. \oL only do tlicsc three

iincstors. but their managenicnLs ha\e become
known Tor progressi\e thinking in ai"eas like
financial control, product research, and in;magcmeiiL training. II obsolescence can cripple vwn
these industries, it can happen an\wluM'e.

P o p u l a t i o n Alytli
The belief that profits arc assured In :in expanding and more allhicnt population is dear to
ibc heart of every industry. IL Lakes the edge
oil' the apprehensions c\cryb(>d\ undcrstandubh'
feels about the I'uLure. If consumers arc iiiidlip l u n g atid also buying iiioix- oT Noiir jiroduet oi'
sci"\icc, you can I'acc Lhe Tuturc with considerably more comfort Lhan il: the marki't is shrinking. .An expanding market keeps the manulacUn"er irom Inning lo think \c!'\ hard or imaginaLi\el\". If thinking is an intellectual response to a problem, then the absence of a problem leads to the absence ol' tbinkijii^. IT \our
product has an aiilomaLicalK cxpantiin;^ market,
tben \{)u will not gi\c much tliougliL to how to
expand iL.
One ol" the iiiosL interesting examples ol this
is pr{)\idcd by Lhe petroleum industrx. Probably our oldest growth industry, it has an en\iablc recorti. While there arc sonic current .ipjirehcnsions about its growth rate, the industrv'
itself Lends to be O[)timistic. IJut I l)eiie\c it can
be demonstrated that it is iindergoiriL: a fundamental \ct t\pical change, it is not oni\ ceasing
io be a growth industry, buL nia\ acLualK he ,i
declining one. relative to other business. \!tliough tbere is w idcsi:>rcatl imawarcncss ol it.
bclie\e that w ilhin
\ c ars the (til industry
ma\ find itself in much the same position of
retrospective glorv that Lhe railroatis are now in.
Despite its pioneering work in cle\eloping and
applying the present-value nirthod of in\csLnicnt evaluation, in eniplovcc i-clations, and in
working with backward counLrics. the petroIcmn busine'ss is a disLressing example ol liow

conijilaccncv and vvronghcadedness can sLuhbornly convert opportunity into near disaster.
One of tbe characteristics of this and oilier
indusLries thaL have believed very strongly in
the beneficial consequences of an expanding
population, while at the same time being industries wiLh a generic product for which there has
appeared to be no competiLive substitute, is that
the jiKli\idual companies bavc sought to outilo
their competitors bv" inijiroving on wiiat they are
already doing. Ibis makes sense, of course, if

sake of continuity, because this second behef is
tied closely to the first, I shall continue with the
same example.
Idea of Indispensability
The petroleum industry is pretty much persuaded that there is no competitive substitute
for its major product, gasoline — or if there is,
that it will continue to be a derivative of crude
oil, such as dicsci fuel or kerosene jet fuel.
There is a lot of automatic wishful thinking
in this assumption. The trouble is that most refining companies own huge amounts of crude
oil reserves. These ha\e value only if there is a
market for products into which oil can be converted — hence the tenacious belief in the
continuing competitive superiority of automobile
fuels made from crude oil.
This idea persists despite all historic evidence
against it. T'he evidence not only shows that
oil has never been a superior product for any
purpose for very long, but it also shows that the
oil industry has never really been a growth industry. It has been a succession of different
businesses that have gone through the usual historic cycles of growth, maturity, and decay. Its
over-all survival is ov\cd to a series of miraciilous escapes from total obsolescence, oi' lastminute and unexpected reprieves from total disa.ster reminiscent of the Perils of Pauline.
Perils of Petroleum
I shall sketch in only the main episodes:
t First, erude oil was largely a patent medicine.
BuL even before thaL fad ran ouL, demand was
greati) expanded by Lhe use of oil in kerosene
lamps. The prospect of lighting the worlds lamps
ga\'e rise to an extravagant promise of growth. The
prosj>ccLs were similar to tbo.se the industry now
holds for gasoline in other parts of Lhe world. IL
can hardly wait for Lhe undcrckneloped nations to
get a ear in every garage.
In the days of the kerosene lamp, the oil eompanies competed witb each other and against gaslight b\' Lrying to improve the illuminating characteristics of kerosene. Then suddenly the impossible happened. F.dison invenLed a light whicb was
totallv nondependent on crude oil. Had it not been
for the growing use of kerosene in spaee beaters,
the incandescent lamp would bave completely finished oil as a growth industry at that Lime. Oil
would have been good for little else than axle grease.
i[ Then disaster and reprieve struek again. Two
great innovations oecurred, neither originating in
the oil industry. The successful de\elopmenL of

49

coal-burning domestie eentral-heating systems made
tbe spaee heater obsolescent. While the industry
reeled, along eame its most magnifieent boost yet
— the internal combustion engine, also invented
by outsiders. Then when the prodigious expansion
for gasoline finally began to level off in tbe 1920 s,
along came the miraculous escape of a central oil
heater. Once again, the eseape was provided by an
outsider's invention and development. And when
that market weakened, wartime demand for aviation fuel eame to tbe rescue. After the war tbe expansion of civilian aviation, Lhe dieselization o-f
railroads, and Lhe explosive demand for cars and
trucks kept the industry's growth in high gear.
I! Meanwhile centralized oil heating — whose
booni poLential had only reeently been proclaimed
— ran IJILO severe eompetition from natural gas.
Wbilc the oil companies themselves owned Lhe gas
tbat now conipeted with their oil, the intlusLry did
not originate the natural gas rc\olution, nor has it
Lo Lhis day greatlv' profited from its gas ownership.
The gas revoluLion was made by nev\Iy formed
transmission companies that luarkeLed the product
with an aggressive ardor. Tbey started a magnilicciiL new industry, firsL against Lhe advice and Lhen
against Lhe resistance of tbe oil com|ianies.
By ail Lhe logic of the siLuaLion, Lhe oil companies Lliemselves should ha\e made Lhe gas revohiLion. They not onlv' owned Lhe gas; they also were
the onh pefjple experieneeti in handling, scrubbing, and using iL, the only people experienced in
pipeline Leclinology and Lransmission, and Lhey undcrsLood beating problems. BuL, parth heeause thev
knew that natural gas would eonipete with their
own sale of heating oil, Lhe oil companies poohpoohed Lhe potentials of gas.
The revolution was finalh starLed bv oil pipeJine
executives who, unable to persuade their own companies to go into gas, quit and organized Lhe .spectaeularh successful gas Lransmission companies.
I:vcii after their success became painfullv evident
Lo tbe oil companies, Lhe laLter did not go into gas
Lransmission. The multibillion dollar business
wbicb should have been theirs went Lo others. As
in the [last, the indusLry was blinded by iLs narrov\' preoccujiation with a specific jiroclucL and Lbe
value of its reserves. It jiaitl litLie or no attention
to its cusLomers' basic needs and preferences.
i[ 1 he posLwar \ cars liav e Jiot witnessed anv
ehange. Immediately after \\"orld War [I the oil
industry was greatly eneouraged about its future
by the rapid expansion of demand for its traditional line of products. In 1950 mosL companies
projecLed annual rates of domestic expansion of
around 6 % through at least 1975. Though tbe
ratio of erude oil reserves Lo demantl in the Free
\\'orid was aboiiL 20 to T, with 10 Lo i being usuallv considered a rcasf>nable workiii'j ratio in the

<-----Page 5----->50 Ihirvani Bitshicss Revicit^
L'nitcd States, bwrniiiii; demand sent oil men searching for more without suffieient re«^atd to what the
future really promised. In 1952 they "liit" in
the Mitldle Hast; the ratio sk\ roeketed to 42 to i.
Ii' ^ross aiklitions to reserves eoiitlnue at the avern<j,v rate ol' the past five years (37 billion harrels
annually), then i)y 1970 tlie reser\e ratio will he
up to 45 to 1. This abundanee of oil has weakened
erudc and produet priees all o\er the world.
Unccrt;nii FuLuic
Manaj^enicnt cannot l'md Jiiiich coiisoialioii
today in the rapidly expanding petrochemical
inchistry, another oil-using idea that did not
orij^inato in the leading firms. The total United
States pi-oductiun ol' petrochemicals is equixalent to about 2% (by volume) ol' the demand
lor cill petroleum products. Althouj^h the petrochemical industry is now expected to grow by
about 10% per year, this will not ollset other
drains ou the growth ol' crude oil consum[)ti(in.
Furthermore, while petrochemical jiroducts aie
many and growing, it is well to remember that
there are non]ietroleuni soiu'ces ol' the basic raw^
material, such as coal. Besides, a lot ol' plastics
can be produced with relatively little oil. A
50,000 barrel-per-day oil rclinery is now considered the abstilule minimum si/e I'or eOieiency.
But a 5,000-barrel-per-day ebeniical plant is a
giant operation.
Oil has never been a continuously strong
growth industry. It has grown by fits and starts,
always miraculously saved by innovations ant!
developments not of its (nvn making. The reason
it has not grown in a smooth progression is that
each time it thought it had a superior product
safe Irom the possil)ility of conii)etiti\e substitutes, the product turned out to be inferior and
notoriously subject to obsolescence. Until now ,
gasoline (lor motor fuel, anyhow") has eseapetl
this fate. But, as we shall see later, it too may
be on its last legs.
The i^oint of all this is that there is no guarantee against product obsolescence. If a eompan\'s own research does nt)t make it obsolete,
another's w ill. Unless aii induslrv is especially
lucky, as oil has been until now, it ean easily
go dow n in a sea of red figures — just as tlic
railroads have, as the buggy whip manulaeturers ha\e. as the eorner grocery chains have, as
most of the big movie companies have, anti indeed as man\' otlier industries ha\"e,
rhe 1>est way for a firm to be lucky is to make

its own luck. That requires knowing what malics
a business suceessful. One of the greatest enemies of this knowledge is mass production.

Produclion Pressures
Mass-production industries are impelled by a
great drive to produee all they ean. The prospeet of steeply declining unit costs as output
rises is more than most companies ean usually
resist. The profit possibilities look spectacular.
All effort ioeuses on protluetion. fhe result is
that marketing gets negleeted.
John Kenneth Galbraith contejuls that just
ihe opposite occurs.' Output is so prodigious that
all elfort concentrates 011 tryiug to get rid of it.
Fie says this accounts [or singing comniercials,
desecration of tbe countryside \\ilh advertising
signs, and other wasteful and vulgar practices.
(lalbraith has a finger on something real, but he
misses the strategic point. Mass jiroduction tlocs
indeed generate great pressure to "move" ihe
product. But ^vhat usually gets emphasized is
selling, not marketing, Marketing, being a more
sophisticated antl complex process, gets ignored.
The differenee between marketing ant! selling
is more than semantic. Selling Focuses on the
needs of tiie seller, marketing on tbe needs of
tbe buyer. Selling is preoccupied with the seller's need to convert his product into cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of
the customer by means ol' the product and the

In some industries the enticcinents ol full
mass production have been so j^owerful that for
many \'ears top management in elFect has told
the sales tlepartments. "You get ritl of it; we'll
worry about prolits." By coiitrast, a truly marketing-minded lirm tries to ereate value-satisfying goods and services that consimiers will want
to l)uv. What it oilers !br sale includes not only
the generie product or service, but also how it
is made available to the customer, in what form,
when, under what conditions, and at what terms
of trade. Most imptulant. what it offers !or
sale is determined not by the seller but by the
buyer. The seller takes bis cues froui the buyer
in sueh a way that the product becomes a consequence of the marketing elfort, not vice versa.
T.ag in IX'lroit
This may sound like an elementary rule tif
Inisiness. but that does not keep it from being

<-----Page 6----->Marketing Myopia
\'iolated wholesale. It is certainly more violated
than honored. Take the automobile industry:
Here mass production is most famous, most honored, and has the greatest impact on the entire
society. The industry has hitched its fortune to
the relentless requirements of the annual model
change, a policy that makes customer orientation
an especially urgent necessity. Ctmsequently the
auto eonipanies annually spend millions of dollars
on consumer research. But the fact that the new
compact cars are selling so weil in their Hrst year
indiciites that Detroit's vast researches have for a
long time failed to reveal what the customer realU'
wanted. Detroit was not persuaded that he wanted
anything different from \^hat he had heen getting
until it lost millions of customers to other sninll
car manufacturers.
Ho\v could this unbelie\'ahle lag bcliind consumer wants have heen perpetuated so long? W hy
did not research reveal eonsunier preferences hefore consumers' buying decisions themselves revealed the faets? Is that not what eonsumer research
is for — to hnd out before the fact what is going
to happen? The answer is that Detroit never really
researched the eustomer's wants. It only researclied
his preferences between the kinds of things which
it had already decided to offer him. For Detroit
is mainly produet-oriented, not customer-oriented.
To the extent that the customer is reeogni/.ed as
having needs that the manufaeturer should try to
satisfy, Detroit usually aets as if tlie job can be dOne
entirely by product changes. Oeeasionally attention
gets paid to financing, too, hut that is done more
in order to sell than to enable the customer to buy.
As for taking care of other customer needs, there
is not enough being done to write about. The areas
of the greatest unsatisfied needs are ign!)red, or at
best get stepchild attention. These are at the point
of sale and on the niatter of automoti\'e repair and
maintenance. Detroit views these problem areas as
being of seeondary importance. That is underscored by the fact that the retailing and servicing
ends of this industry are neither owned and operated nor controlled by the manufacturers. Once
the ear is produced, things are pretty nuieh in the
dealer's inadequate hands. Illustrative of Detroit's
arm's-length attitude is the fact that, while servicing
holds enormous sales-stimulating, profit-building opportunities, only 57 of Chevrolet's 7,000 dealers
provide night maintenance service.
iXfotorists repeatedly express their dissatisfaetion
with servieing and their apprehensions about buying cars under the present selling setup. The anxieties and problems they encounter during the auto
buying and maintejiance processes are probably more
Intense aiic! widespread today than 30 years ago.
Yet the automobile companies do not scan to listen
to or take their cues from the anguished consumer.

51

If they do listen, it must be through the filter of
their own preoccupation with produetion. The marketing effort is still view^ed as a necessary eonscquence of the product, not vice versa, as it should
he. That is the legacy of mass produetion, with its
paroehial view that profit resides essential!} in lowcost full production.

What Ford Put First
The jirolit lure of mass production obviously
has a place in the plans and strategy of business
management, but it must always follow harii
thinking about the customer. This is one of the
most important lessons that we can learn from
the contradictory Ijchavior of Henry Ford. In a
sense Ford was both the most brilliant and the
most senseless marketer in American history.
He was senseless because he refused to give the
customer anything but a black car. He was
brilliant because he fashioned a production system designed to fit market needs. We habitually
celebrate him Tor the wrong reason, his production genius. His real genius Avas marketing.
We think he w as able to cut his scllino; price and
therefore sell millions of S500 ears because his
in\ention of the assembly line had reduced the
costs. Actually be invented the assembly line
because he had concluded that at S500 he could
sell millions of ears. Mass prothiction was tbe
result not the cause of his low prices.
Ford repeatedly emphasi/ed this point, but a
nation of production-oriented business managers
refuses to hear the ,t;reat lesson he taught. Here
is his operating philosophy as he expressed it
succinctly:
"Our polic) is to reduce the price, extend tlie operations, and impro\e the artiele. You will notiee
tliat tlie reduction of price comes first. We ba\ c never considered any costs as fixed. Therefore we iirst
rctiucc tlie price to the point wliere w'c believe more
sales will result. Then we go ahead and try to
nijikc tlie priees. W'c do not botlicr about tlic costs.
The new priee forces the eosts down. The more
usual way is to take the costs and then determine
the priee, and although that method may be seientiiic
in the narrow sense; it is not seicntifie in the broad
sense, because what carthh' use is it to know tlie
eost if it tells >ou that you eannot manufaeturc
at a price at whicli the article can be sokl? But
more to the point is the fact that, although one
may calculate what a eost is, and of course all of
our costs are carefully calculated, no one knows
Avhat a cost ought to be. One of the ways of discovering . . . is to name a price so low as to
forec e\er>body in the place to the highest point
of efficiency. The low price makes e\er\body dig

Product Provincialism
The tanlali/ing pfulil possibilities ol' lo\v nnit
prodiRtion costs Jiiay I)C the most seriously sell(iecei\ing attitude that can afllict a company,
particularly a "growth" company where an apparently assured expansion of demand already
tends to undermine a proper concern for the
importance of marketing and the customer.
The usual result of this narrow preoccupation \\ith so-called euncrete matters is that instead oi <:;ro\ving, the industry declines. It usually means that the product fails to atlapt to the
constantly clian!iing patterns of consiniier needs
and tastes, to new asid modiliet! marj^ieting institutions and jiraetices, or to protluct de\elopnients in competing oi" complementary industries. 'Lhe industry has its eyes so jirmly on its
own specific product that it does not see how it
is being made obsolete.
The chissieal example of this is the buggy
whip industry. No amount of prothict impro\ement eoukl stave off its death sentence. But had
the intlustry delinetl itself as being in the transportation business rather than the buggy whip
business, it might iKne sur\i\ed. It woidd ha\e

providing a stiiiiulant or catalyst to an energy
source, it might lia\e survived b\ becoming a
manui'acturcr oi', say, fanbelts or air cleaners.
What may some day be a still more classical
example is. again, tlie oil industry. ILning let
others steal marvelous opportuiiities from it
fe.g., natural gas, as already mentionetl. missile
fuels, and jet engine lubricants"), one would expect it to ha^e taken steps ne\er to let tiiat happen again. But this is not the ease. W'e are
now getting extraordinary new de\eiopments in
fuel systems speeifically designed to power automohiles. Not only are these developments eoncentrated in ilrms outside tlie petroleum industry, hut petroleum is almost S) stematlcalh ignoring them, securely content in its wedded bliss
to oil. It is the story of the kerosene lamp \ersus
the incandescent lamp all over again. Oil is trying to improve hydrocarbon fuels rather than
to develop any fuels hest suited to the needs of
their users, whether or not made in dill'ercnt
ways and with diflerent raw materials from oil.
Here are some of the things w iiich nonpetroleimi companies are working on:

<-----Page 8----->Marketing Myopia
oil companies do ^mything different? Would not
chemical fuel cells, batteries, or soliir energy
kill the present product lines? The answer is
that they would indeed, and that is precisely
the reason for the oil firms having to develop
these power units hefore their competitors, so
they will not be companies without an industry.
Management might he ]nore likely to do what
is needed for its own preservation if it thought
of itself as being in the energy business. But
even that would not be enough if it persists in
imprisoning itself in the narrow grip of its tight
proeluct orientation. It has to think of itself as
taking care of customer needs, not finding, refining, or even selling oil. Once it genuinely
thinks of its business as taking care of people's
transportation needs, nothing can stop it from
creating its own extra\ agantly profitahic growth.
"Creative Destruction"
Since words are cheap and deeds are dear, it
may be appropriate to indicate what this kind
of thinking involves anel leads to. Let us start
at the beginning — the customer. It can he
shown that motorists strongly dislike the hother,
delay, and experience of buying gasoline. People actually elo not buy gasoline. They cannot
see it, taste it, feel it, appreciate it, or really test
it. What they buy is the right to eontinuc driving their cars. The gas station is like a tax eollcctor to whom people are compelled to pay a
periodic toll as the price of using their ears.
This makes the gas station a hasically unpopular
institution. It can never be made popular or
pleasant, only less unpopular, less unpleasant.
To reduce its unpopularity completely means
eliminating it. Nohody likes a tax collector, not
even a pleasantly cheerful one. Nobody likes to
interrupt a trip to huy a phantom product, not
even from a hand.some Adonis or a seductive
Venus. Hence, companies that are w^orking on
exotic fuel substitutes which will eliminate the
need for frequent refueling are heading elirectiy
into the outstretched arms of the irritated motorist. They are riding a wave of inevitability, not
because they arc creating something which is
technologically superior or more sophisticated,
hut because they are satisfying a powerful eustomer need. They are also eliminating noxious
odors and air pollution.
Once the petroleum companies recognize the
customer-satisfying logic of what another power
system ean do, they will see that they have no
more ehoiec ahout working on an efficient, long-

53

lasting fuel (or some way of delivering present
fuels without bothering the motorist) than the
big food chains had a choice ahout goiug into
the sitpermarket husiness, or the vacuum tuhe
companies had a choice ahout making semiconductors. For their own good the oil lirms will
ha\e to destroy their own highly profitable assets. \ o amount of w ishl'ul thinking can save
them from the necessity of engaging in this form
of "creative destruction."
I phrase the need as strongly as this because T
think management must make quite an effort to
break itself loose from conventional \va\s. Tt is
all too easy in this day and ago i'or a company or
industry to let its sense of purpose hecome dominated by the economies of full production and
to develop a dangerously lopsided prodtict orientation. Tn short, if management iets itself
drift, it invariahly drifts in the direction of thinking of itself as producing goods and services, not
customer satisfactions. While it probahly will
not descend to the depths of telling its salesmen,
"You get rid of it; we'll ^vorry al)out prolits," it
can, without know ing it, be practicing precisely that formula for withering deeay. The historic fate of one growth industry after another
has been its suicidal product provincialism.

Dangers of R & D
Another big danger to a firm's eontinued
growth arises when top management is wholly
transfixed by the jirofit possibilities of technical
research and development. To illustrate I shall
turn first to a new industry — electronics —
and then return once more to the cfil companies.
i3y comparing a fresh example with a familiar
one, I hope to emiihasi/e the prevalence and
insidiousness of a hazardous way of thinkiiig.
Marketing Shortchanged
In the ease of electronics, the greatest danger
which faces the glamorous new companies in
this field is not that they do not pay enough
attention to research and development, but that
they pay too much attention to it. And the fact
that the fastest growing electronics firms owe
their eminenee to their heavy emphasis on technical research is completely heside the point.
They have vaulted to allluenee on a sudden crest
of unusually strong general reeeptiveness to new
technical ideas. Also, their sueeess has heen
shaped in the virtually guaranteed market of
military subsidies and by military orders that in

has, in other words, been almost totally devoid

In short, the managements of the new glamonrgrowth eompanies tend to favor those business activities which lend themselves to careful stud\% experimentation, and control — the hard, practieal,

Stepchild Ircatment
The oil industry is a stunning example of
how science, technology, and mass production
can divert an entire group of companies from
ihcir main task . To the extent the consumer is
studied at all (which is not much), the focus
is forever on getting information w'hich is designed to help the oil companies impro\e what
they are now doing. I'hey try to discover more
convincing acKertising themes, more eirecti\c
sales promotional dri\es, v^'XvAt the market shares
of the various companies arc, what people like
or dislike about service station dealers and oil
companies, and so forth. Nobody seems as interested in probing deepl\' into the basic human
needs that the industry might be trying to satisfy
as in probing into the basic properties of the raw
material that tlie companies work w ith in trying
to ddi\'cr customer satisfactions.
Basic questions about customers and markets
seldom get asked. The latter occupy a stepchild
status. TIie\' are rccogni/ccl as existing, as ha\
in>i to be taken care of, but not worth \erv mueb

<-----Page 10----->Marketing
real thought or dedieatcd attention. Nobody
gets as excited about the customers in his own
backyard as alxiut the oil in the Sahara Desert.
Nothing illustrates better the neglect of marketing than its treatment in the industry press:
The centennial issue of the American Petroleum
btstlinie Quancrly, published in 1959 to celebrate
the discovery (if oil in Titusvillc, Pennsylvania,
contained 21 feature articles proclaiming the industry's greatness. Only one of these talked about
its achie\cincnts in marketing, and that was only
a pictorial record of how service station architecture
has changed. The issue also contained a special
secticm on "New Horizons," which was devoted to
showing tbe magnificent role oil would play in
America's future. livery reference was ebulliently
optimistic, never implying once that oil might have
some hard competition, liven the reference to
atomic energy was a cheerful catalogue of how oil
would help make atomic encrg\' a success. There
was not a single apprehension that the oil industry's alllnence might be threatened or a suggestion
that one "new iiorizoii" might include new and
better ways of serving oil's present customers.
Gut the most revealing example of the stepchild
treatment that marketing gets was still another special scries of short articles on "The Revolutionary
Potential of F.kctronics," Under that licading this
list of articles appeared in the table of contents:
• "In the Seareli for Oil"
• "In ProdiK'ilon Operations"
• "In Tleiinery Processes"
• "In Pipeline Operations"
Signilicantly, e\ery one of the industry's major
funetional areas is listed, except marketing. Win?
I'Jther it is l)elie\ed that electronics holds no revolutionary potential for petroleum marketing (which
is palpabK' wrong), or tlie editors forgot to discuss
jiiarketiiig (which is more likely, and illustrates its
stepeJiild status).
The order in which the four functional areas
are listed also betrays the alienation of the oil industry from the consiuner. The industry is implicitly (lelined as beginning with the search for
oil and ending with its distribution from the refinery. But the truth is, it seems to me, that the
industry begins with the needs of the customer for
its products. From that primal position its defhiition moves steadily backstream to areas of progressively lesser importance, imtil it finally comes to
rest at the "search for oil."
Beginning i^- End
The view that an industry is a customer-satisfying process, not a goods-producing process, is

Myopia

S5

vital for all businessmen to understand. An industry begins with the customer and his needs,
not with a patent, a raw material, or a selling
skill. Given the customer's needs, the industry
develops backwards, first concerning itself \\ ith
the physical delivery of customer satisfactioi>s.
Then it moves back further to ereatiiv^ the things
by whieh these satisfactions are in part uchicxcd.
How these materials are created is a matter of
indifference to the customer, lience the j:)articular form of manufacturing, processing, or whathave-you cannot be considered as a vital aspect
of the industry. Finally, the industry mo\cs
back still further to finding the raw materials
necessary for making its products.
The irony of some industries oriented tow ard
technical research and develojiment is that the
scientists who occupy the high executive jiositions are totally unscientific when it conies t(»
defining their companies' o\er-all needs and |iiuposes. They violate the first two rules of tbe
scientific method — being aware of and defining their companies' problems, anel then developing testable hypotheses about so]\ing them.
They are scientific only about the conxenicnt
things, sueh as lahoratory and product exjicrinients. The reason that the customer (and tbe
satisfaction of bis deepest needs) is not considered as being "the jiroblcm* is not because there
is any certain belief that no such problem exists,
bitt because an organizational lifetime has conditioned management to look in the opposite direction. Marketing is a stepchild.
T do not mean that selling is ignored. Far
from it. But selling, again, is not marketing.
As already pointed out, selling concerns itself
\vith the tricks and techniques of getting people
to exchange their cash for your product. Ft Is
not concerned w ith tbe values that the exchange
is all about. And it does not, as marketing in\ariably does, vie/w' the entire business process
as consisting of a tightly integrated effort to discover, create, arouse, and satisfy customer needs.
71ie customer is somehody "out there" w ho, with
jiropcr cunning, can be separated from his loose
change.
/\ctually, not even selling gets much attention in some technologically minded firms. Because there is a virtually guaranteed market for
the abundant flow of their new products, they
do not actually know what a real market is. It
is as if they lived in a planned economy, mo\ ing
their products routinely from factory to retail
outlet. Their suecessful concentration on prod-

ucts tends to convince them of the soundness of
what they have been doing, and they fail to see
the "otherins clouds over the market.

Conclusion
Less than 75 years ago American railroads
enjoyed a fierce loyalty among astute Wall Strccters. Furopean monarchs invested in them heavily. Eternal ^vealth w as thought to be the benediction for anybody who could scrape a few
thousand dollars together to put into rail stocks.
No other form of transportation could compete
with the railroads in speed, flexibility, durability,
economy, and growth potentials. As Jacc|ucs
Barzun put it, 'By the turn of llic century it
was an institution, an image of man, a tradition,
a code of honor, a source of poetr)-, a nurscr\'
of boyhood desires, a sublimcst of toys, and the
most solemn machine ^ next to the funeral
hearse — that marks the ciwchs in in;m"s life." "
Fven after tbe advent of automobllc-s, trucks,
and airplanes, the railroad tycoons remained imperturbably .self-confident, [f you had told them
60 years ago that in 30 years they would he flat
on their backs, broke, and pleading for government subsidies, they would ha^c thought you
totally demented. Such a future was simply not
considered possible. It was not enen a discussaf)le subject, or an askable question, or a matter
which any sane person \\c»uld consider worth
speculating about. The \cry thought was insane.
Yet a lot ol' insane notions no\^' ha\c matter-offact acceptance — for example, the idea of 100ton tubes of metal moving smoothly through the
air 20,000 feet above the earth, loaded with
100 sane and solid citizens casually drinking
martinis — and they have dealt cruel blows to
the railroads.
What specifically must other companies do to
avoid this fate? What does customer orientation in\olve? f bese questions have in part been
answered by the preceding examples and analvsis. It would take another article to show in
detail what is required for specific industries,

me merely suggest what appear to be some general requirements.
Visceral Fed of Greatness
Ob\i()usK the company has to do what sur\i\al demands. It has to adapt to the requirements of the market, and it has to do it sooner
rather than later. But mere sur\i\al is a so-so
aspiration. Anybody can survive in some way
or other, even the skid-row bum. The trick is
to siu-\i\e gallantly, to feed the surging impulse
of conunercial mastery; not just to experience
the sweet smell of success, but to bave the visceral fed of entrepreneurial greatness.
No organization can achieve greatness without a vigorous leader who is driven onward by
his own pulsating will to succeed. He has to
ha\ e a \ ision of grandeur, a vision that can produce eager follo\i'crs in \ast numbers. In business, the followers arc the customers. To produce these cuslomers, the entire corporation
must be viewed as a customer-creating and customer-satisfying organism. Manageinent must
think of itself not as producing products but as
providing customer-creating value satisfactions.
It must push this Idea (and everything it means
and rccjuircs) into every nook and cranny of the
organization. It has to do this continuously and
with the kind of Hair that excites and stimulates
tbe people in it. Otherwise, the company will
be merely a series of pigeonholed parts, witli no
consolidating sense of purpose or direction.
In short, the organization must learn to think
of itself not as producing goods or services f)Ut
as hiniii^i cnstoiiicis, as doing the things that
will make people jraiit to do business with it.
And the chief executive himself has the inescapable responsibility for creating this environment, this \iewpoint, this attitude, this aspiration. He himself must set the company's style,
its direction, and its goals. This means he has
to know precisely where he himself wants to go,
and to makc^ sure the whole organization is enthusiastically aware of where that is. Tliis is a
first rec|uisite of leadership, for niiless he kn<nv>
irJieie he is <j.(>in<i. any road will take him

there.

ff anv road is okay, the chief executive might
as well pack his attache case and go fishing. If
an organization docs not know or care where it
is going, iL docs not neccf to iid\ertise that fact
with a ceremonial figurehead. F.xcrybody will
notice it sf>on enough.
