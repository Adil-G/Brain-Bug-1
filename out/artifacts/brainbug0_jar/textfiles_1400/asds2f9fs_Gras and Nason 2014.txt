We advance understanding of the embedded role of the family household in governing ﬁrm
performance in an impoverished setting. Drawing on bricolage theory, which articulates how
individuals make do with resources at hand, we suggest that family household diversity facilitates
creativity while family household shared business experience facilitates routinization. While
initially performance enhancing, unfettered creativity and overroutinization have detrimental
effects and thus expect the highest levels of performance to occur at moderate levels of family
household diversity and shared business experience. We ﬁnd general support for our hypotheses
using a large sample of ﬁrms and families in impoverished Indian households.

1. Executive summary
Extant entrepreneurship research on the global poor has largely focused on the role of formal and external forces, but there are
powerful informal institutions that play an inﬂuential role on entrepreneurial activity. We build a deeper understanding of the
embedded role of the family household in governing existing economic activity in an impoverished setting. In this context, there is
reason to believe that family and ﬁrm institutions are still inextricably linked (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003) and that the family household
may act as the basal system for economic activity (cf. Zellweger et al., 2012). Yet the family household is not a monolithic force, as
characteristics of family households differ substantially. We utilize two measures of family household composition and explicate
how these characteristics inﬂuence ﬁrm performance in an impoverished context.
Drawing on bricolage theory, which articulates how individuals make do with resources at hand (Baker and Nelson, 2005), we suggest that family household diversity facilitates creativity while family household shared business experience facilitates routinization.
At low levels, diversity creates family household level economies of learning due to increased combinative capabilities and creativity
enhancing cognitive conﬂict. However, at high levels diversity can lead to household diseconomies of learning due to excessive improvisation and detrimental relational conﬂict. Family household shared business experience creates economies of learning that facilitate routinization due to smoother team functioning and increased applicability of the household resource base. However, there are
diseconomies at high levels of shared business experience due to conformity in resource utilization and competence traps that stiﬂe

improvisation. As a result, we contend that while initially performance enhancing, unfettered creativity and overroutinization can
have detrimental effects and thus expect the highest levels of performance to occur at moderate levels of household diversity and
shared business experience.
We test our theoretical development on a sample of 1,307 ﬁrms in 1,056 families of Indian households living in an impoverished
context. More than half of the households consist of makeshift structures and live below the $2.16 per day poverty line (Banerjee and
Duﬂo, 2007). Household sizes are large (average of 6.3) and often include three or more generations (47%) or in-laws (27%) living
under the same roof. The businesses in this context tend to be small micro-enterprises operating in a diverse range of industries
from kirana stores (akin to small convenience stores) to tailoring to operating rickshaws. Most businesses are run out of the household
often without even a separate room, creating particularly weak boundaries separating the family household from the business
operations. In this deeply embedded context, we ﬁnd general support for curvilinear relationships between both family household
diversity and shared business experience on ﬁrm performance.
Our results have implications for both theory and practice. We extend family embeddedness research by exploring differences in
compositional structure across family household units. We also contribute to theoretical development in bricolage by examining the
family as a context for bricolage, drawing greater attention to the underdeveloped component of routinization and highlighting the
threat of unfettered creativity. With regard to practice, our research has implications for diversifying industry and business experience
within family households and proactively managing the threats associated with family household compositional features. These
ﬁndings point to the potential for organizations attempting to serve economically disadvantaged beneﬁciaries to train individuals
to creatively engage in the socially constructed nature of resources and develop family dynamics related initiatives aimed at improving family functioning.
2. Introduction
Research on ﬁrms in developing economies has largely focused on the roles of formal market institutions, large multinational companies, or heroic social entrepreneurs (Bruton, 2010; Dacin et al., 2011). Extant paradigms have sought to stimulate economic activity,
often arguing for institutional reforms to mirror Western societies while largely ignoring organic entrepreneurial activity already taking place. Yet, existing economic activity is extensive in impoverished areas (Schneider, 2002) and ﬁrms vary signiﬁcantly in terms of
type and performance (Frese et al., 2007). We focus on the family as a foundational informal institutional force that inﬂuences ﬁrm
performance in this context. Speciﬁcally, we examine family households, which refers to all individuals related by blood or marriage
who reside in the same household structure.
Pre-industrial economies are characterized by economic activity embedded in social relations (Polanyi, 1944), and these relations
place a particularly strong emphasis on kinship ties (Peredo and McLean, 2013). Family and economic activity are “inextricability
intertwined” (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003), especially in impoverished, informal ﬁrms (Khavul et al., 2009) and collectivist societies
(Hofstede, 1980). Family households are one of the few sources of resources in impoverished contexts (cf. Danes et al., 2008), may
serve as a default governance mechanism for ﬁrms without formal structures (cf. Carney, 2005), and provide a driving force in all
new venture team formation (Ruef et al., 2003).
However, the family household is not a monolithic force. There is substantial variance not only within family ﬁrms (Melin and
Nordqvist, 2007), but also within the family household unit itself. The collective family household bundle of resources may differ in
value and applicability to embedded ﬁrms. We contend that the inﬂuence of the family household on ﬁrm performance will depend
on family household composition characteristics, speciﬁcally, family household diversity and family household shared business
experience.
We draw on the theory of bricolage to explicate the relationship between family household composition characteristics and
ﬁrm performance. In the face of resource-depleted environments, entrepreneurs tend to engage in bricolage, deﬁned as “making
do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities” (Baker and Nelson, 2005: 333). However, not all bricoleurs are equally successful. In impoverished contexts, some entrepreneurs conform to institutionalized constraints on resources while others engage in improvisation across too many domains, stunting potential growth (Baker and
Nelson, 2005). Successful bricoleurs, by contrast, display characteristics of both creativity and routinization (Fisher, 2012). In
our theoretical development, we link family household diversity to creativity and family household shared business experience
to routinization.
Family household diversity reﬂects an array of skills, perspectives, and knowledge that a focal ﬁrm may put to use. The additive
effect of these dimensions is likely to play a critical role on ﬁrm performance, especially in a context with weak boundaries between
family and ﬁrm. At low levels, increasing family household diversity is likely to bring creativity-related performance beneﬁts by
rejecting singular uses of discarded resources and generating novel resource combinations. However, the initial economies of learning
from diverse individual knowledge pools may reach a threshold level as the costs of excessive creativity and relational conﬂicts set in
at high levels. Thus, we expect to ﬁnd the highest performance at moderate levels of family household diversity. Family household
shared business experience refers to total household entrepreneurial experience and industry experience matching the focal ﬁrm.
In resource depleted environments, ﬁrms may be forced to rely on the collective business experience of family household members,
as there are few alternatives for knowledge resources. At low levels, increasing family household shared business experience is likely
to bring routinization-related performance beneﬁts by providing applicable resources and smoothing team functioning. Yet, economies of learning from common experience may eventually give way to path dependence that stiﬂes improvisation (Baker and
Nelson, 2005). As a result, the highest ﬁrm performance is likely to occur at moderate levels of family household shared business
experience.

We test our theoretical development on a sample of 1,307 ﬁrms in 1,056 randomly selected family households located in
impoverished slums of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Recent estimates suggest 70 million Indians dwell in slums
(National Buildings Organization, 2011) and 56% of households from our sample live under the $2.16 per day poverty line
(Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2007). The majority of these houses are “kutcha,” meaning that they are makeshift structures made with
roofs of mud, hay, and other crude material (Banerjee et al., 2006). The ﬁrms in this environment are generally small, with an
average of less than one employee and 2302 Rupees (the equivalent of $52) in sales per week. These micro-enterprises operate
in a diverse range of industries from tailoring and electrical repair to rickshaws and gutka (a tobacco product mixed with fruits,
nuts and spices) selling. As with any community, there is variance in the level of development and resources of households. For
instance, 71% of individuals are literate and 37% of ﬁrms have electricity. We use detailed data on individual family household
members to construct household compositional characteristics and test their inﬂuence on the performance of ﬁrms embedded
in these households.
We make two contributions with this paper. First, we contribute to a growing stream of literature on entrepreneurship in
impoverished settings by examining the important role of the family household as an informal institutional force. In doing so,
we contribute to work on family embeddedness (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003) by exploring heterogeneity in family household
units and revealing compositional factors that help or hinder ﬁrm performance. Second, we contribute to the theoretical development of bricolage by introducing the family household as a context for bricolage activity. In addition, whereas previous research has emphasized the creative and improvisational nature of bricolage (Baker, 2007; Baker et al., 2003; Halme et al., 2012;
Senyard et al., 2014), we draw greater attention to the necessary component of routinization in successful bricolage (Baker and
Nelson, 2005). In doing so, we offer a more comprehensive picture of bricolage that incorporates both creativity and routinization
in a group-level context.
3. Theoretical development
3.1. Entrepreneurship in impoverished settings
The role that entrepreneurship can play in addressing societal needs in developing economies is the subject of an increasingly important dialogue in both research and practice (Bruton, 2010; Bruton et al., 2013; Dacin et al., 2011; Datta and Gailey, 2012; Peredo
and Chrisman, 2006). In this stream, extant studies have focused on the role of formal institutions or external actors and paid relatively
less attention to existing local entrepreneurial activities. Studies have examined microﬁnance actors who control access to capital
(Kent and Dacin, 2013), the potential of innovations to beneﬁt the disenfranchised (George et al., 2012), and the role of macroeconomic institutions (Mair and Martí, 2009). The dominant weltanschauung has been Western-focused, taking the perspective of
multinational corporations that can utilize the world's poor population as a proﬁtable untapped market (Prahalad, 2005) or individual
“heroic” social entrepreneurs who can effect change (Dacin et al., 2011). This orientation has led some to characterize extant research
on the global poor as biased. As Peredo and Chrisman (2006: 331) say of research efforts in impoverished populations, “Despite good
intentions, the most widely adopted approaches have been paternalistic, seeking, even if unintentionally, cultural assimilation, while
ignoring the strength of local organization.”
We attempt to eschew extant literature's Western biases by focusing on existing entrepreneurial activity in impoverished areas.
The economic and cultural environment of entrepreneurs in impoverished settings looks very different from the assumptions that
form the foundation of most management theories. While this difference has been characterized as an institutional void with relatively weak market structures (Khanna and Palepu, 2000; Mair and Martí, 2009), it can also be understood as economic activity that takes
place outside of formal institutional structures (Godfrey, 2011; Webb et al., 2009). In such impoverished contexts, economic activity is
governed by a very different set of institutional forces (Peredo and McLean, 2013). Polanyi (1944) described the marked difference
between industrial and pre-industrial societies as the “great transformation” and contemporary scholars have noted similar
transitions facing many developing countries today (Stiglitz, 2000). A primary differentiating feature of these two socioeconomic structures is embeddedness. In the course of the transformation, Western society moved from a context where social
relations and economy were highly embedded to one dominated by disembedded market forces (Peredo and McLean, 2013).
Entrepreneurship in the impoverished context must consider the unique features of preindustrial economies. Two of the
most important differentiating features include an emphasis on collective orientation (Peredo and Chrisman, 2006) and especially kinship relationships (Khavul et al., 2009; Peredo and McLean, 2013). Most developed Western societies are characterized
by high levels of individualism, whereas many developing countries and India in particular, demonstrate higher levels of a collectivist
orientation (Hofstede, 1980). Rich social networks are a distinguishing characteristic of subsistence marketplaces (Viswanathan,
2007) in which consumers and entrepreneurs play multifaceted and often overlapping roles (Viswanathan et al., 2010). A collectivist
orientation is also reinforced by strong kinship ties that cause the family to become deeply embedded in entrepreneurial activity in
impoverished areas (Danes et al., 2008).
3.2. Family embeddedness in impoverished settings
Throughout much of history, family business was a redundant term (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003). In pre-industrial contexts, the family
unit has long been the dominant source of resources, most notably cheap or even free labor performed by family members
(Stinchcombe, 1965). Recent trends in family composition have increasingly decoupled the relationship between family and business
in Western societies (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003). The average family household size has steadily decreased from 5.7 in 1770 to 4.9 in 1890

to 3.01 in 1970 to 2.55 in 2012 (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003; Glick, 1942; United Nations, 2011). However, these same trends do not
necessarily hold in developing economies and impoverished contexts. In India, the current average household size is nearly double
that of the United States (4.8) and has been relatively high since at least 1970 (5.3) (United Nations, 2011). Evidence from our sample
suggests that mean household size may be even higher in impoverished areas of India (6.3 in our sample). These households engage
more than the nuclear family, as 47% of households in our sample consist of 3 or more generations of family members living in the
same residence and more than 27% of households include in-laws. Further, there is a high overlap between family and ﬁrm in our speciﬁc context of slum ﬁrms in Hyderabad. Less than 1% of ﬁrms even have a separate room in the family household for the business to
operate and business owners report working on average 72 hours a week (Banerjee et al., 2006), indicating weak boundaries between
family and work roles (Ashforth et al., 2000). As a result, there is reason to believe that family and ﬁrm institutions in impoverished
areas are still inextricably linked (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003) and that the family household may act as the basal system for economic
activity (cf. Zellweger et al., 2012).
3.3. Bricolage
Entrepreneurs in impoverished environments may be embedded in the social support of their families, but their larger environment
is characterized by tremendous hardships. Entrepreneurs in impoverished areas must navigate unique challenges such as crime (Sutter
et al., 2013), political conﬂict (Anderson et al., 2010; Tobias et al., 2013), and poor healthcare systems (Banerjee et al., 2006). Even the
once heralded savior of impoverished populations, microﬁnance, has come under criticism and revealed to have unclear beneﬁts
(Field et al., 2013; Verrest, 2013). Mainstream banking logic is increasingly displacing poverty alleviation logic (Kent and Dacin, 2013)
and microﬁnance organizations compete with powerful commercial actors, often to the detriment of the beneﬁciaries they are meant
to serve (Khavul et al., 2013). More generally, the economic environment in impoverished areas lack abundant resources waiting to
be combined to exploit opportunities, but rather are characterized by persistent resource scarcity with only resources of very limited
standard value available (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Bricolage has emerged as a theoretical framework to understand how entrepreneurs
attempt to overcome resource constraints and achieve some success in this challenging context.
Originating with the concept of mythical thought, bricolage has come to refer to the pursuit of “tinkering” or giving new meaning
to existing ideas, terminology, or resources (Levi-Strauss, 1962). Karl Weick (1993) described bricolage as an improvisational process
using resources at hand. Bricolage has since been applied across a wide range of entrepreneurial domains including institutional
entrepreneurship (Cleaver, 2001), technology entrepreneurship (Baker et al., 2003) and social entrepreneurship (Di Domenico
et al., 2010). However, bricolage offers particular explanatory power in understanding the entrepreneurial processes of individuals
faced with penurious environments (Baker and Nelson, 2005).
Building on a Penrosean view of resources and the environment, bricolage contends that even worthless resources can be
imbued with value. Since the use of resources is socially constructed, individuals are only limited in the utilization of resources
by the services for those resources which they envision (Penrose, 1959). Bricoleurs refuse to accept commonly imposed limitations to
existing resources, but rather take action to give otherwise worthless resources new meaning (Fisher, 2012). By improvising and
creatively combining what is at hand, entrepreneurs can create something out of nothing in an impoverished setting (Baker and
Nelson, 2005).
However, not all bricoleurs are equally successful. Firms will grow in resource-depleted environments not only if they are able to
engage in creative processes that generate unique services from worthless resources, but also if they develop efﬁcient processes
(Fisher, 2012). Successful bricoleurs limit the breadth of their entrepreneurial pursuits (Baker and Nelson, 2005), prevent themselves
from becoming overly enmeshed in the environment (Uzzi, 1997), and avoid reinforcing patterns of continuous improvisation that
stall ﬁrm growth (Baker and Nelson, 2005). In doing so, ﬁrms are able to routinize operations in a way that increases efﬁciency and

allows for greater performance (Baker and Nelson, 2005). We suggest that, in impoverished contexts, the family household represents
a powerful force that informs both creativity and routinization and in turn ﬁrm performance.
4. Hypotheses
In order to explain the relationship between family household and ﬁrm performance in an impoverished setting, we develop theory regarding the family household as a context for bricolage. The family household plays an integral role in entrepreneurial and resource utilization processes by providing resources and setting the norms of business operations (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003; Steier,
2009). These inﬂuences are likely to be ampliﬁed in an impoverished context where resources outside of the family are scarce and
there is a strong emphasis on collective kinship ties (Peredo and McLean, 2013). However, since family ﬁrms are not homogeneous
organizations (Chua et al., 2012; Melin and Nordqvist, 2007), family inﬂuence on entrepreneurial behavior may depend on heterogeneity within family units (Sciascia et al., 2013).
We suggest that impoverished family households may be more or less conducive for making do with resources at hand, depending
on their compositional qualities. Speciﬁcally, family household diversity is likely to increase creativity while family household shared
business experience is likely to increase routinization. These theoretical mechanisms of bricolage will have a corresponding effect on
ﬁrm performance. Table 1 summarizes our arguments and expected results. In addition, in offset text boxes, we present short
vignettes of actual families within our sample, describe their household composition at the time of the study, and then engage in
brief ﬁctionalized thought-experiments on how this composition may inﬂuence performance via the hypothesized mechanisms of
creativity and routinization (See Boxes 1 and 2). We present one household that is relatively low on diversity (similarity of business
experience) and one that is relatively high on diversity (similarity of business experience). Each vignette closes with reﬂections on
how changes in household diversity or similarity of business experience may improve current business performance. All ages,
education levels, genders, industries, and business ownership experience are facts while names and events are ﬁctionalized.
4.1. The effects of family household diversity
Family household diversity refers to heterogeneity in a family household's socio-demographic proﬁle. This construct includes four
factors of diversity – business expertise diversity, educational diversity, age diversity and sex diversity. Conceptually this measure
builds on group heterogeneity literature and utilizes salient diversity characteristics identiﬁed by Foo et al. (2005). Since recent literature has shown that individual diversity dimensions may not only have aggregate (Horwitz and Horwitz, 2007), but also additive
effects (Lau and Murnighan, 1998), we utilize a composite measure of household diversity. Family households with low levels of
diversity will have the same type of business expertise, higher ratios of either male or female members, and similar levels of education
and age. On the other hand, family households with high diversity will exhibit substantial heterogeneity across these dimensions. We
suggest that family household diversity will positively inﬂuence creativity.
At low levels, family households should be able to create collective economies of learning by incorporating the individual differences of its members (cf. Yelle, 1979) and thus create a context that is more conducive to the creative utilization of resources. First,
a diverse family household resource bundle will have greater means of being conﬁgured into alternative uses. Resources inherently
differ in the range of productive services that they provide (Penrose, 1959) and the family household bundle is likely to have more
combinative possibilities as the diversity of its individual member skills, peer groups (cf. Byrne, 1971), and networks increase. Diverse
family households will have a heterogeneous collection of individual knowledge pools that can be combined in unique ways to
generate new insights for creative action.
Second, family household diversity provides cognitive beneﬁts that facilitate the novel use of resources at hand. While resources
provide the means to take creative action, bricolage is essentially a cognitive exercise that involves imbuing new meaning to resources
at hand (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Since resource uses are socially constructed, growth is limited by the “productive possibilities that
[a ﬁrm's] ‘entrepreneurs’ see and can take advantage of” (Penrose, 1959: 28). Entrepreneurial individuals leading a ﬁrm must identify
the range of services (uses) resources can provide and envisage ways to combine them in novel ways (Penrose, 1959). Family household diversity should allow entrepreneurs to see a more diverse range of services for the resources at hand by learning about new resource uses. Heterogeneity in a group's demographic characteristics creates a cognitive conﬂict that reduces the threats of homophily
(Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Ruef et al., 2003) and leads to increased group performance, especially for creative outcomes
(Milliken and Martins, 1996). Speciﬁcally, family households may be able to collectively learn from the diverse skill and knowledge
bases of it individual members. These household-level economies of learning may translate into a greater ability to provide new
meaning to otherwise discarded resources in impoverished settings (cf. Baker and Nelson, 2005). The heterogeneous levels of familiarity with resources and family members' different perspectives looking at the same resources (e.g., sewing machines and pushcarts
are common primary assets in our sample) will prevent the singular application of resources. Rather, collective family learning about
resource services will encourage creative experimentation and lead to growth.
However, there are likely to be limits to the beneﬁts family household diversity and potential diseconomies of learning at high
levels. First, diverse family households may become too creative and engage in improvisation across too many domains. The diversity
of perspectives may push ﬁrms in impoverished contexts in so many directions at once that they are unable to reconcile differences
and focus operations on business activities with potential. Unfettered creativity may ultimately entangle embedded ﬁrms in reinforcing patterns that stall ﬁrm growth (Baker and Nelson, 2005).
Second, family household diversity may lead to unhealthy conﬂict that undermines the productive uses of resource combinations.
High levels of demographic diversity increase affective and emotional conﬂict within teams (Pelled, 1996). Families working closely

together can suffer from relational conﬂict (Kellermans and Eddleston, 2004). Diverse family households may develop a kinship distance
that hinders close-knit group functioning (Ensley and Pearson, 2005) and prevents learning as a cohesive unit. The potential for unhealthy
relational and affective conﬂict may be particularly salient for family households in poverty, where family members live in extremely close
physical proximity. In the Hyderabad slum context, there are on average more than 6 individuals living in a single household, with only 2
rooms and no separate workspace. Research has shown that at very close levels of physical proximity, people are very uncomfortable
(Keisler and Cummings, 2002) and an inability to gain physical separation may exacerbate existing conﬂict within diverse groups.
For these reasons, we suggest that family household diversity is likely to have a curvilinear effect on ﬁrm performance in
impoverished settings. At the extreme low end, families may be constrained by their similarity and lack the diversity of perspectives
to spark the creative utilization of resources. At the extreme high-end, very diverse family households may become too creative, suffer
from unhealthy conﬂicts, and be unable to restrict their endeavors to promising avenues that can be productively developed. However, at moderate levels of diversity family households may enjoy the creative beneﬁts of cognitive conﬂict and leverage their collective
learning for novel and productive resource utilization. More formally stated:
Hypothesis 1. Family household diversity will exhibit an inverse U-shaped relationship to ﬁrm performance such that a moderate amount
of diversity will be optimal for ﬁrm performance, ceteris paribus.
4.2. The effects of family household shared business experience
Household shared business experience refers to the extent of business ownership and industry experience that matches the focal
ﬁrm's industry. A family household with signiﬁcant work experience outside the ﬁrm's industry may have extensive expertise but will
be low in shared business experience. By contrast, a family household with multiple business owners and extensive experience in the
ﬁrm's focal industry will be high in shared business experience. Conceptually, our measure represents an isomorphic composition

model (Kozlowski and Klein, 2000) and is modeled after Haynes and Hillman's (2010) industry embeddedness measure of board
capital depth.
Household shared business experience is likely to increase routinization. At initial low levels, family households will be able
to accumulate their common experiences into household level economies of learning (cf. Yelle, 1979). Routines are developed
when repetitive focused action is taken to smooth operations and create an efﬁcient process (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Family
households with common business experience develop shared knowledge and mental models (cf. Haynes and Hillman, 2010)
that are reﬁned through repetitive action in the same business or industry operations. These collective experiences create a
family-level labor and knowledge pool that can be more directly applied to a focal ﬁrm. For instance, if a lone individual is involved in an industry compared to half of a family household, there may be a greater ability for the household with deeper
labor, skills and knowledge resources to increase performance. The existence of active and applicable human capital resources
is likely to be critical for a bricolage process that goes to great lengths to convert any passive individual into an engaged stakeholder (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Further, a family household knowledge pool based on within-industry experience may allow
for advice to help individuals avoid making mistakes that other members have made or observed in the industry. With regard to
experience as a business owner, regardless of industry, entrepreneurs often face similar problems and engage in similar
activities (Macmillan, 1986). Greater experience in the entrepreneurial process may allow family embedded ﬁrms to avoid
mistakes and ultimately develop deeper and more efﬁcient routines.
Routines developed through common experience also promote a well-functioning team. In the Penrosean framework on which
bricolage rests, shared experience reduces the adjustment costs of working together and is the only means to develop true “teamwork” (Penrose, 1959:41). As group members have increased familiarity with each other and knowledge of common topics in their
industry, they will communicate with greater ease (Sciascia et al., 2013). The improved functionality of the group should allow for
a smoothing of operations, collective learning and the development of efﬁciencies.
However, there may be costs to very high levels of shared business experience due to the threat of over-routinization. Shared industry experience can create a homogeneity of thinking that prevents strategic change (Haynes and Hillman, 2010) and ultimately
undermine the beneﬁts of household level learning. Families with members from the same industry may be more likely to intentionally or unintentionally pressure individuals to conform to industry and environmental norms (cf. Uzzi, 1996). In the impoverished
context, the detrimental effects of shared business experience will likely reveal itself in an inability to identify novel uses for worthless
resources or to develop creative resource combinations.

In this way, shared business experience may eventually lead family households into a learning trap. While expertise in the industry
facilitates routinization, strong and deep routines can lead to a myopia that limits new development (Levinthal and March, 1993). As
household embedded ﬁrms learn more about shared industry practices and success factors, individuals may become increasingly focused on reﬁning common industry practices. Such family households may become unwilling to incorporate discarded resources and
conﬁne resource utilization to known services. Whereas deep common routines constrain combinative capabilities, successful
bricoleurs consistently test and reject institutionalized constraints placed on resources, instead using resources for purposes for
which they were not designed (Baker and Nelson, 2005).
As a result of its effect on routinization, family household shared business experience may have a curvilinear effect on ﬁrm performance. At the extreme low end, families with little shared business experience will be constrained by an inability to smooth knowledge combinations and create efﬁcient outcomes. At the extreme high end, families with shared business experience will be
constrained by a tendency to conform to norms of resource use that limit combinative possibilities. However, at moderate levels of
shared business experience family households in impoverished settings may derive the beneﬁts of routinization without yet
succumbing to diseconomies of learning, thus achieving the highest levels of performance. More formally stated:
Hypothesis 2. Family household shared business experience will exhibit an inverse U-shaped relationship to ﬁrm performance such that a
moderate amount of shared business experience will be optimal for ﬁrm performance, ceteris paribus.

5. Methods
5.1. Empirical setting and sample
In 2007, a team of academics from two prominent universities in the United States partnered with a large microﬁnance organization (Spandana) to conduct a random household survey of roughly 6,800 households in 104 slums in Hyderabad, India. Researchers
were primarily interested in collecting data that could be used to evaluate the impact of microﬁnance entering the region and
Spandana was interested in expanding operations by opening new branches in the area (Banerjee et al., 2014). As a result, these
slums were selected based on having residents who were desirable microloan borrowers: impoverished, yet had the potential to generate income and repay loans. This classiﬁed the residents as poor, but not ‘the poorest of the poor’ (Banerjee et al., 2014) as the vast
majority of households are not living below the $1 per day extreme poverty line (Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2007).
Within each slum, surveyed households were randomly selected, conditional on the presence of a woman between the ages of 18–
55. Women between the ages of 18 and 55 are typically charged with the maintenance of the household and household ﬁnances in
particular. As a result, they are well-suited to answer questions concerning the household and its members. For each household, survey administrators identiﬁed the woman in this age range most knowledgeable about household ﬁnances. This woman was identiﬁed
by asking directly (to the ﬁrst adult encountered upon arrival): 1) “Is there any woman in the household aged 18–55?” and 2) “Who
(among the women in the 18–55 age group) knows the most about the household ﬁnances?” This respondent was asked for information on anyone who had resided in the household for at least 30 days in the past year and had contributed to and/or drawn from the
household resources. Each individual who met these criteria was further identiﬁed through their relationship to the head of the
household (or as the head of the household). Options included: ‘spouse/partner’; ‘son/daughter’; ‘son-in-law/daughter-in-law’;
‘stepson/stepdaughter’; ‘grandchild’; ‘brother-in-law/sister-in-law’; ‘grandparent’; ‘great-grandchild’; ‘other family’; ‘household
help’; ‘lodger’; and ‘friend’. The last three of these categories were excluded from this analysis as they were deemed not to be family
members; they comprised less than 1% of all individuals identiﬁed. As a result, we restrict our analysis to individuals in the household
related by blood or marriage, which we refer to as the family household.
The respondents were also asked whether any members of the family household owned a business. The interviewer deﬁned a
business in the following manner: “each business consists of an activity you conduct to earn money, where you are not someone's employee.” The interviewer then asked how many businesses the family household is involved in, who in the family household is most
knowledgeable about each business, and who is the owner of each business? A separate interview about each business in the family
household was then conducted with the person most knowledgeable about the business, when possible (see robustness section for
further information on the respondent most knowledgeable about the business). The businesses owned by the entrepreneurs vary
greatly and include kirana stores (akin to convenience stores in the U.S.), gutka sellers, electricians, carpenters, ﬂorists, and mechanics,
along with many other types of business. The common threads among all of these businesses are that they are small – the largest business in our ﬁnal sample has 21 employees (most have none) – and that they are based in resource-poor areas. We were able to match
the business surveys with the corresponding households according to identiﬁcation numbers given to each household and individual.
In total, the two surveys took between one and two hours to complete. Our sample is comprised of these surveys on 1,307 ﬁrms in
1,056 family households.
In an effort to determine the extent to which our family households and entrepreneurs are representative of larger or differing
contexts, we compare several characteristics of our sample to those of the US and India, where possible. First, Gentry and Hubbard
(2004) report that 11.5% of US households own active business assets compared to 34.8% of households with businesses in our sample. Second, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports entrepreneurship activity among 14.1% of US adults and 13.9% of adults in
India (Bosma et al., 2007). Within our sample, 14.1% of adults own a business. Lastly, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor's Report on
Women and Entrepreneurship (Allen et al., 2007) noted that 35% of U.S. entrepreneurs are female and 20% of entrepreneurs in India

are female. Within our sample, 41.1% of entrepreneurs are female. Taken together, we ﬁnd higher levels of household size (previously
discussed), entrepreneurial activity per household, and women entrepreneurship in our Indian sample as compared the U.S.
5.2. Dependent variable
Measuring ﬁrm performance within an impoverished context is a challenging task, primarily due to the fact that detailed accounting records are rarely kept (Frese et al., 2007; McPherson, 1998). Absent such records, we were forced to rely upon ﬁgures drawn from
respondents’ memories. As a result, the longer the time period over which performance is measured, the greater the likelihood of recall biases. Furthermore, a lack of accounting records limits the type of performance measure available. Asking an entrepreneur without such records to produce a ﬁrm's return on investment over a certain time period, or growth from one time period to another,
introduces further complexities and biases. Therefore, we use each respondent's estimation of sales over one week. While relatively
rudimentary in nature, sales ﬁgures have been a common and enduring measure of ﬁrm performance in entrepreneurship research
(Brush and Vanderwerf, 1992), particularly in contexts where more sophisticated measures are difﬁcult to capture (Daniels, 1999;
Frese et al., 2007; Krauss et al., 2005; Lerner et al., 1997). The rationale for a one week time period is that it is a short enough time
period to accurately recall the ﬁgure, yet long enough to represent a larger business cycle. In addition, this measure may be a more
salient indicator of ﬁrm performance in this context than alternative measures. Firms operating in areas near the poverty line have
satisfaction of immediate family needs as primary goals, and thus performance within the last week may provide the best indication
of their ability to provide for and ensure the survival of the family household.
Sales are measured in Rupees. The conversion rate for January 2007 was roughly 1 U.S. Dollar (USD) = 44 Rupees. The average
amount of sales over the last week accrued by the ﬁrms in our sample is 2,302 Rupees, or approximately $52 USD; if that ﬁgure
remained constant over a one-year period, the average ﬁrm in our sample would have roughly $2,720 USD in sales for the year.
Given the distribution of the variable, sales was log-transformed prior to analysis.
5.3. Independent variables
5.3.1. Family household diversity
Family household diversity captures heterogeneity within the socio-demographic proﬁle of a family. The more diverse a family
household, the greater the variety of perspectives, knowledge, advice, skills, experience, and contacts that may be offered by the collective members. We treat diversity as a multidimensional construct and utilize four measures of composition characteristics to produce the household-level diversity construct: business expertise diversity, educational diversity, age, and sex diversity; these
indicators of diversity are based on those used by Foo et al. (2005). As business expertise is a categorical variable, we calculated a

Fig. 1. The curvilinear relationship between family household diversity and ﬁrm sales.

Blau index to operationalize its diversity. Blau's index is calculated as 1 – ΣPi2 where P is the proportion of individuals in a category and
i is the number of categories (Blau, 1977). Business expertise refers to the type of business the individual listed as their primary occupation. There are 41 such categories; the top 10 most common are: tailor, labor, food vendor, agriculture, product vendor, transportation, ﬁnance, communications, retail, and grooming. Similarly, we calculated a Blau index for the categorical variable sex. For the
continuous variables - educational level and age – we calculated the coefﬁcient of diversity (Allison, 2003). Education level is the
individual's last level of schooling completed, ranging from ‘Kindergarten or less’ to ‘Second year post graduation’, with 19 levels of
education possible. Each of the four measures were calculated for the entire household, excluding the focal entrepreneur. Our
items were then summed to create the diversity variable.

5.3.2. Family household shared business experience
Family shared business experience refers to the family household's entrepreneurial experience and level of experience in the focal
ﬁrm's industry. That is, family households with more entrepreneurs and members who work in a business of the same type as the
focal entrepreneur will have greater shared business experience. As a result, our measure of shared business experience captures
both industry-speciﬁc and meta-industry family attributes (Sieger et al., 2011). The greater the family household shared business
experience, the more related and applicable the family's experience is to the focal ﬁrm. The shared business experience variable is
a composite of two measures. The ﬁrst is a ratio of the number of family members (excluding the focal entrepreneur) who have an
occupation in the area of the type of business, over the number of family members in the household. If a focal ﬁrm is a rickshaw
business, the higher the number of family members who also work in transportation, the higher the shared business experience
will be. The second is a ratio of the number of entrepreneurs (excluding the focal entrepreneur) in the family over the number of

family members in the household. These two measures were summed to create family household shared business experience, with a
possible range between zero and two.
5.4. Control variables
We control for several variables that may account for variance in ﬁrm performance in an impoverished setting. Business Type. We
control for the top 10 most common types of business; within our research setting these represent the industries in which the ﬁrm
competes. Roughly 84% of our sample falls into one of the top 10 types of businesses included in our models. The types of businesses
in our sample are those identiﬁed in the diversity and shared business experience variables. Each was assigned a dummy variable in
the model, with a ‘1’ indicating that the ﬁrm is in this line of business and ‘0’ otherwise. Size of Household. We control for the size of
the family (number of persons in household) given that larger families often may draw upon a larger resource base to support the
ﬁrm. Business Partners. We control for the number of partners in the business given that partners may bring additional resources
to an organization and may allow the ﬁrm to handle more customers. A business partner was described by surveyors as “someone
who shares the proﬁt of the business with you, rather than earning a wage.” Firm Size. We include the number of employees in the
organization as a control (employees are designated as those members of the business that receive wages and do not share in proﬁts).
Uses Electricity. We include a dummy variable indicating whether the business uses electricity (1 = yes, 0 = no). This measure serves
as a proxy to control for the ﬁrm's level of technological advancement that may account for ﬁrm performance. Business Age. We
control for the age of the business, in years. Owner Sex. We control for the sex of the business owner (1 = male, 0 = female), as
prior work has demonstrated signiﬁcant differences between male and female entrepreneurs and their businesses (Jennings and
Brush, 2013).
5.5. Analysis procedures
5.5.1. Missing data
As is often the case in contexts such as ours (Daniels, 1999), there is a signiﬁcant amount of missing data present in the sample. The
number of missing data points and missing percentage (indicated in parentheses of all cases for our variables of interest) are broken
down as follows: Sales – 553 (16.19%); Shared business experience – 27 (0.79%); Diversity – 389 (11.39%); Type of Business – 245
(7.17%); Size of Family – 37 (0.79%); # of Business Partners – 535 (15.76%); # of Employees – 355 (10.45%); Uses Electricity – 304
(8.9%); Business Age – 1,487 (43.54%); Owner Sex – 0 (0%). Data was handled via listwise deletion. To determine if there are significant differences between the subsample used in our models and those not used, we created a dummy variable coded ‘1’ if the case
was used in our analyses and ‘0’ otherwise. We then ran a logistic regression using our dependent variable (sales) and independent
variables (diversity and shared business experience) as predictors. Neither sales nor diversity were signiﬁcant predictors of whether
the case was employed in our analysis, but omitted cases (due to missing data on other variables in these cases) did have a signiﬁcantly higher mean shared business experience score than those we included in our analysis. We discuss this issue further in our limitations section.
5.5.2. Primary models and analysis
To test our hypotheses, we ran hierarchical regression with two nested models presented in Table 3. Model 1 consists of the control
variables only. Model 2 includes the variables from Model 1 as well as the terms for diversity and shared business experience and their
squared counterparts. The incremental variance explained by the second model is reported, along with an R2 difference test. To
account for the non-independence of the error terms – a violation of OLS regression – for multiple ﬁrms that came from the same family (roughly 25% of families own multiple ﬁrms), we clustered standard errors by family. The correlation coefﬁcients and descriptive
statistics are displayed in Table 2. The coefﬁcients among continuous variables are derived from Pearson correlations, those among
binary variables are derived from tetrachoric correlations, and those between a continuous and binary variable are derived from
biserial correlations.
5.5.3. Robustness checks and post-hoc analyses
In addition to our primary analyses, we conducted several alternative speciﬁcations to the empirical model to ensure the robustness of our results and explore the data further. First, we run our models with an alternative dependent variable – the extent to which
ﬁrm sales exceeded or fell short of the averages sales for a particular type of business. This variable was created by calculating the
average sales for each type of business in our sample and subtracting this value from each individual business's sales. As this is an alternate method to account for industry effects (Sharp et al., 2013), the industry dummy variables were not included in the models. The
results of this alternative speciﬁcation are in Models 3 (controls only) and 4 (controls plus independent variables).
Second, since roughly half of the ﬁrms in our sample come from households that operate multiple ﬁrms, we ran our analysis on this
subsample. Having multiple ﬁrms in a family household may weaken the effect of household composition characteristics as attention
to and interactions with the ﬁrms may be spread thin, contributing little to each ﬁrm. On the other hand, the relationships may
strengthen if having multiple ﬁrms is synergistic with respect to family member attention and interactions. We explore these possibilities by running our primary models on this subsample, via a Heckman selection model. Our selector variable was coded ‘1’ if a family has multiple businesses and ‘0’ if the family only has one business. In the ﬁrst stage, we used family size and number of working
members of the family as predictors of the likelihood of having multiple businesses. The second stage is identical to the models reported in the paper, with the addition of the inverse mills ratio from the ﬁrst stage. The results are presented in Table 3 under Model 5

(controls only) and Model 6 (controls plus independent variables). We ﬁnd that our IV coefﬁcients, both linear and curvilinear,
remained in the same direction and became more strongly signiﬁcant in this subsample.
Third, in order to get a more ﬁne-grained picture of the effects of our composite independent variables of interest, we ran our
model with each dimension of family household diversity and shared business experience entered as separate variables. The results
of this robustness test showed that no diversity dimension, including occupational diversity (β = 0.53; p N .10), educational diversity
(β = 0.35; p N .10), sex diversity (β = 1.03; p N 0.10) or age diversity (β = −0.55; p N .10) had any signiﬁcant direct effects on performance. This suggests that no single diversity dimension is necessarily driving our results. However, we do ﬁnd that business ownership experience is signiﬁcantly positive (β = 1.79; p b 0.05) while shared industry experience is signiﬁcantly negative (β = −3.84;
p b 0.05). This indicates that entrepreneurial experience is likely driving the upward portion of our shared business experience curve
while industry experience is driving the downward negative slope at high levels.
Fourth, as noted above, interviewers asked to speak to the person most knowledgeable about the business's operations, expenses,
and income when populating the business survey. In 14% of the cases, the surveyor was not able to speak directly to the person most
knowledgeable about the business. We ran a robustness check by inserting a dummy variable capturing whether or not the interviewer spoke with the most knowledgeable person – the coefﬁcients remained in the same direction and signiﬁcance levels were retained.
Lastly, as a robustness test to account for non-independence of error terms, we modeled the data as cross-sectional panels with random effects and the households representing the panel variable. There were no signiﬁcant differences in our results.

6. Results
The descriptive statistics and correlations (Table 2) reveal some interesting aspects and relationships in our sample. Regarding
ﬁrm size, the majority of ﬁrms in our sample have no employees (mean of 0.34, ranging up to 21 employees) and no business partners
(mean of .05, ranging up to 10 partners) for the focal entrepreneur. While very small organizational sizes are common in
impoverished contexts, they certainly highlight a limitation in generalizing our ﬁndings to other types of ﬁrms. Next, we note that
while families in our sample tend to have a fairly large amount of diversity, ranging from 0.96 to 4.14 with a mean of 2.55, they
tend to have very little shared business experience, ranging from zero to .92 with a mean of .06. The latter is somewhat surprising
given the limited occupational opportunities traditionally available in resource-scarce contexts. As may be expected, the number of
business partners, ﬁrm size, the use of electricity, and the age of the business are all positively correlated with the performance of
the business, although the number of partners is not signiﬁcant. Inasmuch as the use of electricity is a proxy for how technologically
advanced a ﬁrm is, the correlations demonstrate that ﬁnance, communications, retail, and grooming are the more advanced business
types, whereas labor, food vendor, agricultural, product vendor, and transportation are relatively less advanced. Lastly, shared business experience and diversity are not signiﬁcantly correlated with sales; however, bivariate correlations are not particularly well suited for testing curvilinear relationships. We next investigate these curvilinear relationships with our hypothesis tests.
Hypothesis 1 predicts that family household diversity will exhibit a curvilinear effect with a moderate amount of diversity
being optimal for ﬁrm performance. The diversity coefﬁcients in Model 2 (β = 3.12; p b 0.05), Model 4 (β = 3.11; p b 0.05), and
Model 6 (β = 4.74; p b 0.05) are positive and signiﬁcant. The squared diversity coefﬁcients are negative and signiﬁcant in Model 2
(β = −0.58; p b 0.05), Model 4 (β = −0.58; p b 0.05), and Model 6 (β = −0.86; p b 0.05). These results indicate a quadratic relationship between family household diversity and performance. To shed more light on the results, we plotted the relationship between
family household diversity and performance, based on the primary analysis in Fig. 1. As predicted, the apex of the curve falls at a moderate level, with very high levels of diversity corresponding to the lowest levels of performance. Taken together, we ﬁnd support for
Hypothesis 1.3
Hypothesis 2 predicts that family shared business experience will exhibit a curvilinear effect with a moderate amount of shared
business experience being optimal for ﬁrm performance. The coefﬁcients for shared business experience in Model 2 (β = 2.48; p b
0.05), Model 4 (β = 2.52; p b 0.05), and Model 6 (β = 4.79; p b 0.01) are positive and signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcients for the squared
terms are negative and signiﬁcant in Model 2 (β = −5.56; p b 0.01), Model 4 (β = −5.90; p b 0.01) and Model 6 (β = −8.40; p
b 0.01). These results indicate a quadratic relationship between shared business experience and performance. The plot of the predicted curve provided in Fig. 2 reveals moderately low levels of family household shared business experience corresponds to the highest
level of performance. Hypothesis 2 was therefore supported.4
Beyond our hypothesis tests, the control variables produced some interesting and unexpected results as well. Surprisingly, neither
the size of the family household nor the size of the business is signiﬁcant a predictor of sales. Firm size (number of employees) is interesting as it is a traditionally strong predictor of sales in much of management research that focuses on larger ﬁrms in more developed contexts; this does not appear to be the case in our context. Of the top industries we analyzed (omitted from table), the highest
performing businesses seem to be those in food vending, transportation, retail, and grooming, whereas organizations concerning traditionally more advanced lines of business such as communications and ﬁnance do not perform as well. Lastly, it may be notable that
while no control variables shifted into signiﬁcance when the independent variables were added to our models, one shifted out of signiﬁcance (albeit slightly) between Models 1 and 2 – number of Business Partners – which indicates some degree of shared variance.
3
To further understanding of the difference diversity makes on performance, we calculated the change in sales based on a one unit change in diversity: 1318 Rupees,
or roughly $29.
4
To further understanding of the difference shared business experience makes on performance, we calculated the change in sales based on a one unit change in
shared business experience: 301 Rupees, or roughly $7.

This might suggest that family household members may sometimes act as de facto business partners; that with certain levels of similar
business experience or entrepreneurship in the family, one may not need as many business partners to perform well.

7. Discussion
The family household has an important inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance in an impoverished setting. This ﬁnding lends support to
the treatment of the family as an informal institution embedded in economic activity especially in the context of developing economies (cf. Aldrich and Cliff, 2003; Peredo and McLean, 2013). Further, we ﬁnd the nature of family household inﬂuence is not uniform,
but rather contingent on household compositional characteristics. Our analysis extends the approach of exploring heterogeneity
amongst family businesses (Melin and Nordqvist, 2007) to differences across family units (cf. Sciascia et al., 2013).
Our results indicate that embedded ﬁrm performance is highest at moderate levels of family household diversity and moderately
low levels of shared business experience (Figs. 1 and 2). In further analysis of household shared business experience, the positive effect of household entrepreneurial experience on ﬁrm performance may indicate the existence of entrepreneurial spillover beneﬁts
within households. By contrast, the negative effect of shared industry experience may be evidence of collective knowledge corridors
that restrict, rather than expand, growth opportunities. As a result, families in impoverished households should be judicious in the
extent to which they engage in the same industry and when possible seek to diversify industry experience amongst family members.
Our study opens up avenues for further research to examine a more ﬁne-grained understanding of the nature of family inﬂuence
on embedded entrepreneurial activity. While we focus on sustaining existing businesses, the family household is likely to play a critical role in the decision to start a business (Laspita et al., 2012; Zellweger et al., 2011) and in the new venture creation process (Aldrich
and Cliff, 2003; Steier, 2009). Families may also be aware and take action to minimize the risks and exploit the beneﬁts of their household compositional structures. Such proactive tactics may be achieved through adaptive learning (cf. Teece et al., 1997), modulating
the family's conversation or conformity orientation (Sciascia et al., 2013) or calibrating responses towards risk-taking activities
(Chrisman and Patel, 2012). If diverse family households can more effectively manage negative conﬂict, they may be able to extend
the beneﬁts of their diverse resource pool. This points to the potential for insights from family therapy and other family science ﬁelds
to beneﬁt impoverished ﬁrm performance (cf. James et al., 2012). For instance, microﬁnance organizations and NGOs seeking to serve
beneﬁciaries in this area may develop family dynamics related initiatives aimed at improving family functioning.
In addition, future research may focus on other family inﬂuences that can be more directly controlled. For instance, the family
household can provide (or not) resources beyond human capital such as ﬁnancial, social and physical resources to their ﬁrms
(Sharma, 2008). These resources may be of great import in otherwise resource-depleted environments, especially since broader
sets of family capital are especially relevant in collectivist cultures outside of Western norms (Danes et al., 2008). Finally, unobserved
variables such as family values, norms and beliefs are likely to play a critical role in shaping the entrepreneurial activity that occurs in
impoverished settings (cf. Aldrich and Cliff, 2003).
Our theoretical development extends bricolage research. Whereas previous studies have examined the individual bricoleur characteristics (Zahra et al., 2009) or larger macro-economic bricolage processes (Mair and Martí, 2009), we introduce the meso-level institution of the family household as a context for bricolage activity. In doing so, we provide a deeper understanding of a context within
which bricolage occurs (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Speciﬁcally, we suggest that family households have an important inﬂuence on the
critical components of creativity and routinization. Further, our approach indicates that micro-ﬁnance and NGO organizations may
stimulate economic activity not only through investment in tangible and single application assets, but also through training individuals to creatively engage in the socially constructed nature of resources in impoverished settings.
While extant research has tended to focus on the beneﬁts of creativity in bricolage (Baker et al., 2003; Senyard et al., 2014), we
draw attention to the potential downside of too much creativity. We suggest that a disproportionate emphasis on the creativity component of bricolage may lead to a misunderstanding of effective entrepreneurial action in impoverished settings. We may ﬁnd an illustrative parallel in the world of art. In the artistic style that bears its name, bricolage involves the creation of a work of art by
assembling a diverse collection of items that happen to be available, but imbues the utilized items with a new logic and meaning.
On the other hand, a style also involving the use of diverse items, but focusing exclusively on creativity is Dadaism. Dadaist art embraces the creative combination of random material but seeks to assemble them in a way that is intentionally nonsensical. As a result,
Dadaism actively rejects logic and meaning. Using this analogy, our theoretical development suggests that entrepreneurs in
impoverished settings enacting a Dadaist approach of unfettered creativity will suffer performance disadvantages.
Bricolage is often acknowledged for its contributions to understanding creativity and improvisation (Fisher, 2012), yet far less attention is given to the important and foundational factor of routinization (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Our theoretical development explicates the role of routinization in an impoverished context by articulating the beneﬁts of household level economies of learning from
shared experience and the downside of competence traps. Future research should devote further attention to the underdeveloped
aspect of routinization in bricolage theory.
Future research should also explicitly examine the relationship between creativity and routinization. While we examine the
downside of too much creativity or too much routinization, the two factors may act as important complements to offset each other's
negative effects. On the one hand, creativity may provide a means break out of the path dependence and strategic conformity that
plagues overroutinization. On the other hand, routinization may provide a means to reﬁne creative activity in a way that harnesses
its beneﬁts and prevents inefﬁcient outcomes (cf. Ancona and Caldwell, 1992; Taggar, 2002). If this is the case, successful bricoleurs
may need to navigate the sensitive tension between creativity and routinization. With direct measurements of creativity and routinization, scholars would be able to model and test moderation effects to answer this important question.

Future research exploring the tension between creativity and routinization may draw inspiration from and contribute to dynamic
capabilities literature by revealing how ﬁrms can develop smooth functioning routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982) that simultaneously allow for creative adaptation and change (Teece et al., 1997). While this literature was developed outside of a realm of ﬁrms in
impoverished areas, it has quite broad intellectual roots (building on Polanyi's work about knowledge) and may provide insights useful for the new theoretical work necessary to fully contextualize our understanding of bricolage in impoverished settings. In doing so,
new theorizing may be able to fulﬁll Baker and Nelson's (2005) call to develop the concept of bricolage capabilities as a means to understand how certain ﬁrms are able to more successfully implement bricolage compared to other ﬁrms.
While great care should be taken in any attempt to generalize our study to other research settings, our empirical results and theoretical development may be insightful outside of the realm of impoverished settings as well. Our approach to understanding heterogeneity in family household composition may be instructive for future research on family entrepreneurship. The dominant approach
in family business studies has been to examine differences between family and non-family ﬁrms or variance in level of family involvement in ﬁrm ownership and management (Gedajlovic et al., 2012). However, our approach suggests that the family household has an
inﬂuence on individual owner operated businesses regardless of whether other family members are involved in the ﬁrm. In this way,
the family household may spawn the creation of new ventures (Steier, 2009) and serve as a vehicle for entrepreneurial activity over
time (Jaskiewicz et al., in press; Zellweger et al., 2012).
In addition, our approach to examining differences in family units may shed light on conﬂicting debates regarding the impact of
family on ﬁrm performance. Some have argued that family negatively inﬂuence performance due to nepotistic agency costs
(Schulze et al., 2001) or risk aversion due to sensitivity to accumulated socio-emotional wealth endowments (Chrisman and Patel,
2012; Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007). Others contend that the stewardship orientation of family ﬁrms (Miller et al., 2008) cultivates a
long-term orientation (Zellweger, 2007) and idiosyncratic resource bundles that lead to competitive advantage (Habbershon and
Williams, 1999). The nature of family inﬂuence on performance may hinge upon inter-family differences, and allowing for heterogeneity in family units may be instrumental to resolving conﬂicts in the family ﬁrm literature.
The role of creativity and routinization should continue to be explored in more developed Western contexts as well. While we
focus on family household composition, in contexts where family and business are not too tightly intertwined, ﬁrms may rely on alternative mechanisms to modulate their level of creativity or routinization. For instance, governance boards and management team
composition will likely inﬂuence the level of ﬁrm innovativeness as well as its development of efﬁcient routines (Hambrick and
Mason, 1984; Haynes and Hillman, 2010).
8. Limitations
First, caution should be taken when attempting to generalize our results to other contexts. The small gutka sellers and rickshaw
organizations in our sample bear little resemblance to the large publically traded ﬁrms or fast growing gazelles, which may be
more familiar to scholars in developed economies. However, ﬁrms in impoverished settings represent an important phenomenon
and the study of them expands the domain of management and entrepreneurship research in meaningful ways (Bruton, 2010;
Bruton et al., 2013). In fact, they represent a more prevalent organizational form than the very large public ﬁrms that have
dominanated strategy studies. Second, due to data limitations, we do not directly test the inﬂuence of the family on creativity and routinization components of bricolage. Rather, we rely on theory to guide the ways in which our family household composition measures
will impact creativity and routinization and provide evidence that those ﬁrms effectively engaging in bricolage will have higher levels
of performance (Baker and Nelson, 2005). However, a more direct test of our model would be that bricolage processes mediate the
relationship between family household composition and ﬁrm performance.
Third, the nature of our research setting limited our ability to employ more sophisticated measures of ﬁrm performance. As
discussed in the methods section, without detailed records of business transactions (Rutherford, 2000) traditional accounting performance measures are not possible and may not be meaningful to the focal entrepreneurs we study. While we employ a measure that
we believe is relevant to entrepreneurs in impoverished settings, developing rigorous and salient measures of ﬁrm performance represents an important area of inquiry for future research in this context. Fourth, there was a signiﬁcant amount of missing data on several variables in our dataset. This may be an artifact of the research setting as respondents may be less likely to understand survey
questions (particularly those regarding business operations) or less willing to provide information on certain family matters. These
factors were partially mitigated by having locals conduct the interviews, but the scope of the missing data remains a limitation.
Our observation that family households with higher levels of shared experience were more likely to be omitted suggests that our results may underestimate or misspecify the true effects of shared business experience on performance. It is possible that family households with higher levels of shared industry experience and ﬁrm ownership were unwilling to provide answers regarding other
questions, such as performance. This points to the estimated nature of performance in our sample and opens the potential for individuals to be biased in their response in effort to gain an advantage (either by not responding or manipulating their response). While we
have no reason to suspect systematic biasing of the performance indicator in our randomly selected sample of family households, the
estimated nature of performance opens avenues for interesting future research, especially in studies using microﬁnance loan applications where biased estimates may lead to advantages in loan approval.
Fifth, reverse causality is a concern with our cross-sectional data. It may be that (up to a point) owners of increasingly successful
ﬁrms are likely to have more children over time or support more grandparents (increasing age and education diversity). It may also be
that ﬁrm performance inﬂuences household similarity of business experience, but reverse causality in this case may be more likely to
manifest as a positive linear relationship to performance (rather than the negative relationship that we ﬁnd at high levels) as more
successful ﬁrms would be able to hire family members or allow members to start their own ﬁrms. Nevertheless, reverse causality

remains a concern, but also an opportunity to fulﬁll calls for future research to examine how ﬁrms inﬂuence family level outcomes
(Jennings et al., 2013)
Finally, by utilizing the family household as the unit of analysis we limit our examination to family members living within the
household and contributing to or drawing from household resources. While this approach excludes non-family members living within
a household (b.1% in our sample), these individuals may be more prevalent in other contexts. It would be interesting to examine the
ways in which non-family household residents differ (or not) from family household members (cf. Distelberg and Sorenson, 2009). In
addition, while we are restricted to examining the impact of the immediate family household it is likely that family members living in
other households have a qualitative impact on ﬁrm operations. It is worthwhile for future research to examine the effects of
composition and activities in the broader family unit.
9. Conclusion
In this study, we examine the effect of household compositional structure on ﬁrm performance in impoverished Indian slums. We
ﬁnd that our sample of enterprises have the highest performance at moderate levels of household diversity and shared business
experience. Our study draws attention to the heterogeneous inﬂuences of family on entrepreneurial performance, illuminates the
importance of routinization in bricolage, and hopefully provides a meaningful basis on which future research can build to explain
performance of micro-enterprises in impoverished areas.
