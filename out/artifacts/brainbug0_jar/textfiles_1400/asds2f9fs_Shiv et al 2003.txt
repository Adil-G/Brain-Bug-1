ABSTRACT—Can

dysfunction in neural systems subserving
emotion lead, under certain circumstances, to more advantageous decisions? To answer this question, we investigated how normal participants, patients with stable
focal lesions in brain regions related to emotion (target
patients), and patients with stable focal lesions in brain
regions unrelated to emotion (control patients) made 20
rounds of investment decisions. Target patients made more
advantageous decisions and ultimately earned more money from their investments than the normal participants
and control patients. When normal participants and control patients either won or lost money on an investment
round, they adopted a conservative strategy and became
more reluctant to invest on the subsequent round; these
results suggest that they were more affected than target
patients by the outcomes of decisions made in the previous
rounds.
In contrast to the historically dominant view of emotions as a
negative influence in human behavior (Peters & Slovic, 2000),
recent research in neuroscience and psychology has highlighted
the positive roles played by emotions in decision making (Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1997; Damasio, 1994;
Davidson, Jackson, & Kalin, 2000; Dolan, 2002; LeDoux, 1996;
Loewenstein & Lerner, 2003; Peters & Slovic, 2000; Rahman,
Sahakian, Rudolph, Rogers, & Robbins, 2001). Notwithstanding the fact that strong negative emotions such as jealousy and
anger can lead to destructive patterns of behavior such as
crimes of passion and road rage (Loewenstein, 1996), in a series
of studies using a gambling task, researchers have shown that
individuals with emotional dysfunction tend to perform poorly
compared with those who have intact emotional processes (Bechara
et al., 1997; Damasio, 1994; Rogers et al., 1999). However,
there are reasons to think that individuals deprived of normal

emotional reactions might actually make better decisions than
normal individuals (Damasio, 1994). For example, consider the
case of a patient with ventromedial prefrontal damage who was
driving under hazardous road conditions (Damasio, 1994).
When other drivers reached an icy patch, they hit their brakes
in panic, causing their vehicles to skid out of control, but the
patient crossed the icy patch unperturbed, gently pulling away
from a tailspin and driving ahead safely. The patient remembered the fact that not hitting the brakes was the appropriate
behavior, and his lack of fear allowed him to perform optimally.
A broad thrust of the current research is to delve into this latter
possibility, that individuals deprived of normal emotional reactions might, in certain situations, make more advantageous
decisions than those not deprived of such reactions.
Recent evidence suggests that even relatively mild negative
emotions that do not result in a loss of self-control can play a
counterproductive role among normal individuals in some situations (Benartzi & Thaler, 1995). When gambles that involve
some possible loss are presented one at a time, most people
display extreme levels of risk aversion toward the gambles, a
condition known as myopic loss aversion (Benartzi & Thaler,
1995). For example, most people will not voluntarily accept a
50–50 chance to gain $200 or lose $150, despite the gamble’s
high expected return. Myopic loss aversion has been advanced
as an explanation for the large number of individuals who prefer
to invest in bonds, even though stocks have historically provided a much higher rate of return, a pattern that economists
refer to as the equity premium puzzle (Narayana, 1996; Siegel
& Thaler, 1997).
On the basis of research showing that patients with neurological disease that impairs their emotional responses take risks
even when they result in catastrophic losses (Bechara et al.,
1997), as well as anecdotal evidence that such patients may,
under certain circumstances, behave more efficiently than normal subjects (Damasio, 1994), we hypothesized that these same
patients would make more advantageous decisions than normal
subjects (or than patients with neurological lesions that do not
impair their emotional responses) when faced with the types of
positive-expected-value gambles we have just highlighted. In

other words, if myopic loss aversion does indeed have an
emotional basis as suggested in the literature (Loewenstein,
Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001), then any dysfunction in neural
systems subserving emotion ought to result in reduced levels of
risk aversion and, thus, lead to more advantageous decisions in
cases in which risk taking is rewarded.
To test our hypothesis, we developed a risky decision-making
task that simulated real-life investment decisions in terms of
uncertainties, rewards, and punishments. The task, closely modeled on a paradigm developed by Gneezy (1997) to demonstrate
myopic loss aversion, was designed so that it would behoove
participants to invest in every round because the expected value
on each round was higher if one invested than if one did not. Our
goal, then, was to demonstrate that an individual with a deficient
emotional circuitry would experience less myopic loss aversion
and make more advantageous decisions than an individual with
an intact emotional circuitry. Such a finding would provide a
new source of support for the idea that emotions play an important role in risk taking and risk aversion.

On, Tranel, Denburg, & Bechara, 2003). All control patients
have been shown to perform advantageously on the Iowa Gambling Task and to have normal EQi scores (Bar-On et al., 2003;
Bechara et al., 2003). The target and control patients had a
mean age of 53.6 (SD 5 11) at the time of this study; they had
14.5 years of education on average (SD 5 3) and mean verbal
and performance IQs of 107.2 (SD 5 11.5) and 103.4 (SD 5
14.5), respectively.
The normal participants were recruited from the local community through advertisement in local newspapers. None had
any history of neurological or psychiatric disease (assessed by
questionnaire). Their mean age was 51.6 years (SD 5 13); on
average, they had 14.6 (SD 5 3) years of education and verbal
and performance IQs of 105.5 (SD 5 7) and 101.4 (SD 5 10),
respectively.
All participants provided informed consent that was approved
by the appropriate human subject committees at the University
of Iowa.

METHOD

Procedure
At the beginning of the task, all participants were endowed with
$20 of play money, which they were told to treat as real because
they would receive a gift certificate for the amount they were left
with at the end of the study. Participants were told that they
would be making several rounds of investment decisions and
that, in each round, they had to decide between two options:
invest $1 or not invest. On each round, if the participant decided not to invest, he or she would keep the dollar, and the task
would advance to the next round. If the participant decided to
invest, he or she would hand over a dollar bill to the experimenter. The experimenter would then toss a coin in plain view.
If the outcome of the toss were heads (50% chance), then the
participant would lose the $1 that was invested; if the outcome
of the toss were tails (50% chance), then $2.50 would be added
to the participant’s account. The task would then advance to the
next round.
The task consisted of 20 rounds of investment decisions, and
the three groups of participants took roughly the same time on
the task. Note that, as indicated earlier, the design of this investment task is such that it would behoove participants to invest in all the rounds because the expected value on each round
is higher if one invests ($1.25) than if one does not ($1). In fact,
if one invests on each and every round, there is only around a
13% chance of obtaining lower total earnings than if one does
not invest in every round and simply keeps the $20.

Participants
We studied 19 normal participants and 15 target patients with
chronic and stable focal lesions in specific components of a
neural circuitry that has been shown to be critical for the
processing of emotions (Damasio, 1994; Davidson et al., 2000;
Dolan, 2002; LeDoux, 1996; Rahman et al., 2001; Sanfey,
Hastie, Colvin, & Grafman, 2003). Specifically, the target patients’ lesions were in the amygdala (bilaterally; 3 patients), the
orbitofrontal cortex (bilaterally; 8 patients), or the right insular
or somatosensory cortex (4 patients). We also studied 7 control
patients with chronic and stable focal lesions in areas of the
brain that are not involved in emotion processing. All these
patients had a lesion in the right (4 patients) or left (3 patients)
dorsolateral sector of the prefrontal cortex.
The patients were drawn from the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience’s Patient Registry at the University of Iowa and have
been described previously (Bechara et al., 1997). The lesions in
the prefrontal cortex are due to stroke or surgical removal of a
meningioma, those in the right insular or somatosensory region
are due to stroke, and those in the amygdala are due to herpes
simplex encephalitis (2 patients) or Urbach Weithe disease (1
patient). (The patients with bilateral amygdala damage due to
herpes simplex encephalitis also have damage to the hippocampal system, and consequently have severe anterograde
memory impairment. However, they have normal IQ and intellect. Removing the data for these patients did not affect the
results.) The control patients’ lesions in the dorsolateral sector
of the prefrontal cortex are due to stroke.
All target patients have been shown to perform poorly on the
Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2003) and
to have low emotional intelligence as measured by the EQi (Bar-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Overall Investment Decisions and Amounts Earned
Examination of the percentage of the 20 rounds in which participants decided to invest revealed that the target patients
made decisions that were closer to a profit-maximizing view-

point than the other participants did (see Table 1). Specifically,
target patients invested in 83.7% of the rounds on average,
whereas normal participants invested in 57.6% of the rounds
(Wilcoxon statistic 5 345.0, p < .002) and control patients
invested in 60.7% of the rounds (Wilcoxon two-sample test
statistic 5 44.5, p < .006). Further, as hypothesized, target
patients earned more money over the 20 rounds of the experiment ($25.70, on average) than did normal participants ($22.80;
Wilcoxon statistic 5 315.5, p < .03) or control patients ($20.07;
Wilcoxon statistic 5 44, p < .006); the average amount earned
by normal participants did not differ from that earned by control
patients (Wilcoxon statistic 5 73, n.s.).
Figure 1 shows the percentage of rounds in which participants
decided to invest, broken down into four 5-round blocks. The
pattern of results suggests that all three groups of participants
started close to the normative benchmark. However, unlike
target patients, who remained close to the normative bench-

mark, normal participants and control patients seemed to become more conservative, investing in fewer rounds, as the
investment task progressed. One potential account for these
findings is that emotional reactions to the outcomes on preceding rounds affected decisions on subsequent rounds for
normal participants and control patients, but not for target patients. We examine this potential account in greater detail in the
next section.

Impact of Outcomes on Previous Rounds on Decisions in
Subsequent Rounds
We conducted a lagged logistic regression analysis to examine
whether the decision-outcome combination in preceding rounds
(did not invest, invested and won, invested and lost) affected
decisions on successive rounds more for control participants
(normal participants and control patients) than for target patients. The dependent variable in this analysis was whether the
decision on a particular round was to invest (coded as 1) or not
invest (coded as 0). The independent variables were several
dummies that were created for the analysis: control (coded as 1
for control participants, 0 otherwise), invest-won (coded as 1 if
the participant invested on the previous round and won, 0
otherwise), invest-lost (coded as 1 if the participant invested on
the previous round and lost, 0 otherwise), and participantspecific dummies (e.g., dummy1, coded as 1 for Participant 1, 0
otherwise). The overall logit model that was tested was decision
5 control invest-won invest-lost control by invest-won control by
invest-lost dummy1 dummy2 etc. Note that any significant interactions would indicate that the effects of the decisions and
outcomes in preceding rounds on decisions made in successive rounds were different for target patients and control participants.
Both interactions in the logit model were significant: control
by invest-won, w2(1) 5 10.27, p < .001; control by invest-lost,
w2(1) 5 31.98, p < .0001. These results suggest that normal
participants and control patients behaved differently from target patients both when they had won on the previous round and
when they had lost. As detailed in Table 1, control participants
were more likely than target patients to withdraw from risk

437

taking both when they lost on the previous round and when they
won. Compared with the target patients, who invested in 85.2%
of rounds following losses, normal participants invested in only
40.5% of rounds following losses (Wilcoxon statistic 5 350.0,
p < .001), and control patients invested in only 37.1% of such
rounds (Wilcoxon statistic 5 45, p < .006). Similarly, although
target patients invested in 84.0% of rounds following wins,
normal participants invested in only 61.7% of rounds following
wins (Wilcoxon statistic 5 323, p < .01), and control patients
invested in 75.0% of such rounds (Wilcoxon statistic 5 67.5,
p 5 .16). These results also suggest that normal participants and
control patients were considerably less risk aversive following
wins than following losses (normal participants: 61.7% vs. 40.5%,
difference 5 21.2%; control patients: 75.0% vs. 37.1%, difference 5 37.9%); in contrast, target patients invested equally
often following wins and following losses (84.0% vs. 85.2%,
difference 5 1.2%).
CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study support our hypothesis that patients
with lesions in specific components of a neural circuitry critical
for the processing of emotions will make more advantageous
decisions than normal subjects when faced with the types of
positive-expected-value gambles that most people routinely shun.
Such findings lend support to theoretical accounts of risk-taking
behavior that posit a central role for emotions (Loewenstein
et al., 2001). Most theoretical models of risk taking assume that
risky decision making is largely a cognitive process of integrating the desirability of different possible outcomes with their
probabilities. However, researchers have recently argued that
emotions play a central role in decision making under risk
(Mellers, Schwartz, & Ritov, 1999; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &
MacGregor, 2002). The finding that lack of emotional reactions
may lead to more advantageous decisions in certain situations
lends further support to such accounts.
Our results raise several issues related to the role of emotions
in decision making involving risk. It is apparent that neural
systems that subserve human emotions have evolved for survival purposes. The automatic emotions triggered by a given
situation help the normal decision-making process by narrowing down the options for action, either by discarding those that
are dangerous or by endorsing those that are advantageous.
Emotions serve an adaptive role in speeding up the decisionmaking process. However, there are circumstances in which a
naturally occurring emotional response must be inhibited, so
that a deliberate and potentially wiser decision can be made.
The current study demonstrates this ‘‘dark side’’ of emotions in
decision making. Depending on the circumstances, moods and
emotions can play useful as well as disruptive roles in decision
making. It is important to note that previous experiments demonstrating a positive role of emotion in decision making involved tasks in which decisions were made under ambiguity

438

(i.e., the outcomes were unknown; Bechara et al., 1997). In the
present experiment, the patients made decisions under uncertainty (i.e., the outcome involved risk but was defined by some
probability distribution). We do not know at this point whether
decisions under uncertainty and decisions under ambiguity
draw upon different neural processes, so that emotion is disruptive in one case but not the other. Regardless, the issue is not
simply whether emotions can be trusted as leading to good or
bad decisions. Rather, research needs to determine the circumstances in which emotions can be useful or disruptive, and
then the reasoned coupling of circumstances and emotions can
be a guide to human behavior.
