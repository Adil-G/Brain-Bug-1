ABSTRACT
Scholars have studied how entrepreneurs acquire resources but have not
examined how resources may be bundled with constraints, which can
threaten entrepreneurial autonomy. Organizational sponsors, such as
incubators and accelerators, provide entrepreneurs with resources, but
how do entrepreneurs sustain autonomy while seeking resources and support? We studied five entrepreneurial firms in a business incubator over a
six-month period. While benefitting from incubator resources, entrepreneurs also experienced unexpected constraints, including mentor role
conflict, gatekeeper control, and affiliation dissonance. By showing how
entrepreneurs unbundled the incubator’s resources from constraints, we

One challenge for entrepreneurs starting new ventures is how to gather the
resources needed to pursue nascent opportunities (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Baker & Nelson, 2005; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Singh, Tucker, &
House, 1986). By definition, entrepreneurs are under-resourced (Stevenson &
Jarillo, 1990), and thus those wishing to be successful figure out early on that
they will need the help of many others (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). In
addition to capital investment, entrepreneurs seek support to craft their new
role, validate their business model, and mobilize social networks to identify
and secure new suppliers and customers (Katila, Rosenberger, & Eisenhardt,
2008; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Zott & Huy, 2007). The generation of
personal wealth is not the only motivator for entrepreneurship (Graebner &
Eisenhardt, 2004). In addition to creating wealth, social change, or other
forms of value, one reason many entrepreneurs launch new ventures is to
create and control their own organization (Rindova, Barry, & Ketchen,
2009). Rindova and colleagues call attention to the emancipatory dreams of
entrepreneurs who seek to “escape from or remove perceived constraints”
(Rindova et al., 2009, p. 480) as a vital and under-appreciated motivator to
starting new ventures. They argue that what is core to entrepreneurs’ motivation is the pursuit of freedom and autonomy.
Few entrepreneurs can successfully launch a venture entirely on their
own, and most will rely on the support of outside individuals and organizations to obtain resources and increase their chances of survival (Aldrich &
Ruef, 2006; Stinchcombe, 1965). When entrepreneurs initiate new ventures,
they typically seek mentoring, capital, and other resources from a diverse
array of informal connections (such as friends, family, and business associates) as well as from formal organizations (such as investors, government
agencies, business incubators, and venture accelerators). Traditionally, as
many as one quarter of new ventures have obtained support from one or
more of these formal types of organizational sponsors (Reynolds, 1997;

<-----Page 2----->Help Me Do It on My Own

279

Thornton, 1999). Organizational sponsors help “mediate the relationship
between new organizations and their environments” by providing resources
intended to increase firm survival rates (Amezcua, Grimes, Bradley, &
Wiklund, 2013, p. 1628).
Organizational sponsors differ in the range and type of resources they
provide to entrepreneurs and the expectations associated with that support.
Government loan programs and investors typically provide capital with the
promise of achieving specific milestones, while incubators and accelerators
may offer capital along with a variety of social resources such as networking, mentoring and shared office space, with less-specified constraints
(Cohen, 2013; Leblebici & Shah, 2004). From 2000 to 2012, the number of
incubators increased by 50% in the United States, and applications to incubators doubled (Needleman & Maltby, 2012). If it is true that entrepreneurs’ desire for autonomy is a central motivation to launching a new
venture, then it is puzzling why so many entrepreneurs seek support from
sponsoring organizations such as incubators and accelerators. One explanation on the demand side is that entrepreneurs increasingly seek the social
benefits that can stem from interacting with their peers within such organizations. An explanation on the supply side is that investors are interested in
gaining early access to investment opportunities and incubators and accelerators can help them “pre-screen” the viability of new ventures and reduce
the risks associated with potential investment.
From our perspective, the more interesting question is not why incubators are so popular but, rather, what takes place within an incubator’s four
walls. If it is the interactions between organizational sponsors and entrepreneurs that are purported to create value, then understanding this process is
critical. Collaboration in the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities is
essential for success, yet entrepreneurs also seek autonomy when launching
their new ventures. How both incubators and entrepreneurs recognize,
adapt to, or address this tension is under-appreciated. “Previous research
has emphasized the need for entrepreneurs to mobilize resources to accomplish objectives … but it has not fully explicated the consequences of the
‘strings attached’ that come with these resources” (Rindova et al., 2009:
484). While the “strings attached” with formal investment decisions are
usually clearly codified, the “strings attached” in managing embedded relationships (Uzzi, 1996) are less so. There are benefits to be gained from the
relational capital that organizational sponsorship can provide, but it also
may entail becoming embedded in a web of social relations can constrain
as well as enable an entrepreneur’s autonomy (Granovetter, 1985;
Uzzi, 1996).

Despite the awareness that resources often come with “strings attached,”
there has been tremendous fanfare about the role business incubators and
venture accelerators play in helping entrepreneurs without an appreciation
of how the twin desires to both seek autonomy and support may conflict.
How do entrepreneurs sustain their autonomy while seeking resources and
support from a sponsoring organization? To answer this question, our
research examines how entrepreneurs make use of incubator resources
while trying to maintain their autonomy and launch independent ventures.
We conducted six months of field research at a Silicon Valley business incubator which hosted entrepreneurs and their new ventures. While much of
the incubator’s value in supporting nascent ventures was in line with theoretical expectations, we also observed ways in which resources were
bundled with constraints, threatening entrepreneurs’ autonomy. In
response, we discovered that both entrepreneurs and incubator staff used
distinct practices to unbundle resources from their associated constraints.
Our research provides a grounded theoretical explanation of how a specific
type of embedded relationship, organizational sponsorship, not only provides resources but also involves constraints on entrepreneurial behavior.
We show how entrepreneurs and sponsors work to unbundle resources
from constraints so that entrepreneurs can exert their autonomy while cultivating resources to support their nascent ventures.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND AUTONOMY
The desire for autonomy has been consistently cited as one of the primary
reasons that individuals choose to become entrepreneurs. Early theories of
entrepreneurship emphasized that entrepreneurs shared a “desire for independence” (Collins & Moore, 1964, p. 93). A survey of 405 owner-operators
of growth-oriented ventures found that, on average, the highest ranked
reason for starting a new business was to have freedom in the way the founder worked (Birley & Westhead, 1994). In a more recent study, the desire
for independence was, on average, the highest ranked reason for starting a
business (Carter, Gartner, Shaver, & Gatewood, 2003). While Rindova
et al. (2009) define this desire for autonomy as breaking free from the
authority of another, the reality is that entrepreneurs depend on many
others, such as suppliers, customers and investors, for resources.
A large body of literature elaborates on the vulnerability of nascent
firms and shows how the viability of nascent firms depends on the ability of

<-----Page 4----->Help Me Do It on My Own

281

entrepreneurs to manage relationships with others in their environment
(Baum & Oliver, 1991; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996; Ozcan &
Eisenhardt, 2009). Resource dependence scholars have long argued that
reliance on resources can drive firms to seek ties with others to increase
their organization’s viability (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). For example, firms
that established alliances with an array of actors, such as universities,
research institutions, marketing firms, or other companies exhibited significantly higher growth (Baum, Calabrese, & Silverman, 2000). A firm’s ability to draw upon a diverse portfolio of organizational partners can be quite
valuable and enhance a firm’s ability to innovate and maintain viability
(Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996; Powell, White, Koput, & OwenSmith, 2005).
While the need to garner support for nascent ventures from other organizations is well documented, what is less explored is the degree to which
resources, once acquired, place constraints on the entrepreneur’s autonomy
over his or her venture. Entrepreneurs dependent on organizational sponsors can face emergent constraints similar to those embedded in dense
social networks. For example, firms in New York City’s garment district
gained the benefits of joint problem solving from the dense social networks
within which they were embedded, but those firms also faced constraints
that firms in arm’s-length relationships did not (Uzzi, 1996). Rindova and
colleagues note that “individuals who seek freedom and independence often
find that they become controlled by the arrangements they make to gain
legitimacy and access to resources” (Rindova et al., 2009, p. 483). Yet, little
research has examined how entrepreneurs negotiate the tension between
seeking independence on the one hand and relying on others for resources
and support on the other hand.
While the entrepreneurship literature has long been aware of entrepreneurs’ need for autonomy and independence, scholars have not reconciled
this need with entrepreneurs’ growing interest in organizational sponsors
such as accelerators and incubators. Incubators and accelerators differ
from other types of organizational sponsorship
such as investors
in
that they require frequent interaction between the organization and the
entrepreneurs they are supporting. Because hosted firms are typically
embedded in incubators and accelerators at a shared physical premise, if
there is tension between entrepreneurs’ desire for autonomy and the constraints placed on them from a sponsoring organization, this tension would
likely be amplified in this context. Thus, incubators provide a rich setting
in which to examine the tensions that arise from entrepreneurs’ twin desires
of autonomy and support, and to examine how this tension is addressed.

ENTREPRENEURS AND ORGANIZATIONAL
SPONSORSHIP
Organizational sponsors, such as business incubators and venture accelerators, mediate the relationship between new organizations and their environments by creating a “resource-munificent context intended to increase
survival rates among those organizations” (Amezcua et al., 2013, p. 1628).
Organizational sponsorship can enhance firm survival rates in two ways: by
either buffering nascent firms from the harsh realities of their environment
or by providing a bridge between nascent firms and the relational connections critical to their survival (Amezcua et al., 2013; Baum & Oliver, 1991).
For example, organizational sponsors such as business incubators can buffer new firms by offering infrastructural and business support that would
otherwise be prohibitive. They can also enhance new ventures’ social capital (Shane & Stewart, 2002) by acting as a conduit to critical network
resources. The general assumption is that a sponsor’s social networks can
remove possible barriers to resource providers and grant preferential
access to the types of social connections that new organizations may lack
(Baum & Oliver, 1991; Leblebici & Shah, 2004).
Both venture accelerators and business incubators are models of organizational sponsorship where entrepreneurs can receive mentorship and other
resources helpful to the development of new ventures (Cohen, 2013;
Leblebici & Shah, 2004). While venture accelerators focus on taking a
cohort of entrepreneurs from initial concept to a business plan within a fixed
time period, business incubators focus on accepting entrepreneurs and their
team after a business opportunity has already been identified. Incubators
provide a physical space and prepare ventures to acquire financial backing
and eventual independence from the incubator. Although their forms differ
slightly (Cohen, 2013), in both cases organizational sponsorship is generally
understood to be a temporary relationship targeting the very earliest stages
of a new venture, when ventures are at their most vulnerable to failure. The
aim is to help the venture pass through the rocky first stages of formation to
transition successfully into an independent venture.
Business incubators in the United States date from the 1950s, and they
were initially non-profit organizations representing attempts by local governments to promote regional small business development (Allen &
McCluskey, 1990). Entrepreneurs typically seek admission to an incubator
in return for payment which may be direct or through an equity stake in
the enterprise (Leblebici & Shah, 2004; Rice, 2002). Business incubators

<-----Page 6----->Help Me Do It on My Own

283

vary in the intensity of their engagement with entrepreneurs
from
“laissez-faire” to “strong intervention” (Bergek & Norrman, 2008).
Historically, incubators provided limited resources such as shared space
and business services (Leblebici & Shah, 2004). Over time, incubators have
evolved to take on mentoring, networking, education, and even investment
roles (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Hansen, Chesbrough, Nohria, & Sull,
2000; Leblebici & Shah, 2004). This change has ignited academic interest in
incubators as unique organizations that give rise to new organizations
themselves (Leblebici & Shah, 2004).
Prior research on business incubators has identified four primary benefits that incubators extend to entrepreneurs: mentoring, brokering, legitimacy, and shared physical resources (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Hansen
et al., 2000; Leblebici & Shah, 2004). First, mentoring services may take the
form of advice on how to refine a business plan, approach possible investors, or write a marketing plan. Second, incubators may provide entrepreneurs with preferential access to network resources that would otherwise be
difficult for a nascent firm to access. Third, incubators can confer legitimacy to the founder which may indirectly affect others willingness to invest
in the new firm; as has been pointed out in prior research, “When there is
extensive competition among potential entrepreneurs to get the attention
and advice of those who have the resources, membership [in an incubator]
provides the legitimacy needed to summon the help of those who are in critical decision-making positions” (Leblebici & Shah, 2004, p. 369). Fourth,
but perhaps least important, incubators help nascent ventures reduce their
administrative overhead costs by sharing office space and associated
infrastructure.
The role of incubators as funders, coaches and mentors to entrepreneurs
has grown, but how they create value for entrepreneurs remains understudied. The extant research has been largely atheoretical and focused on
either the configuration or attributes of incubators (Hackett & Dilts, 2004)
or incubator outcomes (Bergek & Norrman, 2008). Little scholarship examines the processes and interactions that take place inside incubators which
convert entrepreneurial opportunities into independent ventures. It is precisely these interactions, however, that are proposed to create the most
value: “If the area of incubator-incubation research is to advance in a theoretically meaningful manner beyond simple lists of critical success factors,
then we must turn our attention from ‘what’ are the important factors to
‘how’ and ‘why’ and ‘in what context’… these factors are interrelated”
(Hackett & Dilts, 2004, p. 74). In other words, what is needed is a focus on

<-----Page 7----->284

the dynamic processes that take place within incubators rather than on
their static features or outcomes. We need to understand how organizational sponsors engage and support entrepreneurs and the expectations
under which this support is received. Thus, we examined how five entrepreneurial firms hosted by a single incubator interacted with incubator staff
while attempting to create independent ventures.

RESEARCH SETTING AND METHODS
The primary research setting for this study was a high-technology business
incubator located in the Silicon Valley region of California. We refer to the
incubator as Incupro and individual names have been changed for the purpose of this study. The incubator started operations eight months prior to
the start of this study, and it was funded by a medium-sized venture capital
firm which had the option of investing in incubated firms but had no obligation to do so. The incubator’s business model was to earn revenue
through a combination of monthly payments from incubated ventures
along with gaining early access to potential investment opportunities in the
incubated firms. The incubator employed a director, Tim, to manage operations. Company founders would contact Tim if they were interested in
space in the incubator, and he could charge them a per-month fee for the
use of office space or he could negotiate equity in their company in lieu of
rent. Physically, Incupro occupied the top three floors of a multistory building in a vibrant suburban downtown area.
The director, Tim, had twelve years of experience forming ventures in
Silicon Valley and many years of prior experience leading large organizations. He referred to himself as “a gray-hair,” one who had participated in
several ventures in Silicon Valley over the years. In addition to Tim, there
were three other people on staff: a deputy director, who focused on an
internal venture fund for the incubator; a part-time chief financial officer
(CFO) who provided ad-hoc advice to incubated companies; and a fulltime office manager, who handled general administration for the incubator.
The five incubated companies we studied were all technology-focused
and ranged in size from 2 to about 15 employees, but varied in their product offerings: Digitech, in digital appliances; Optico, in optical components (both cofounders were interviewed); Geotech, in mapping
applications; Earthtech, in outsourcing software; and Worldtech, in global
marketing applications. We interviewed six founders from these five firms

<-----Page 8----->Help Me Do It on My Own

285

who were all new to founding and leading a company in Silicon Valley.
Tim planned to host companies on the premises of the incubator for
approximately six months; they would “graduate” when they secured
venture-backed funding. At the onset of this study, there were eight companies incubated and no companies had yet graduated. During the course of
data collection, two companies graduated and three new companies joined
the incubator.
We employed a grounded-theory approach to our study (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967) drawing on field observation, interviews, and archival data.
Field data at the primary research site, Incupro, were collected over the
course of six months, taking the form of field notes from both scheduled
meetings and general observation, from e-mail message archives, and from
various incubator and start-up documentation, such as investor presentations. One author served as field researcher and was given keys to the building, a cubicle at the incubator, and was on the e-mail distribution list for
all messages sent from the director to his distribution list of founders. Over
100 e-mail messages sent by the director were logged during the course of
the study. On average, observations were made weekly over the course of
the six months, with over fifty hours of direct observation. This six-month
window of observation was about the length of time that firms were
expected to make use of the incubator, giving us a longitudinal view of the
range of interactions between entrepreneurs and incubator staff during the
process of incubation.
Semi-structured interview data were gathered from the entrepreneur
founders of the five companies incubated at the research setting, as well as
from two members of the incubator management team. In addition, interviews were conducted with the directors of six other incubators, to understand incubator activities and processes more broadly. The first author
collected observational data, but for ease of presentation, the collective will
be used when describing observations.
The primary field researcher first proposed a set of codes to explain the
activities within the incubator. A second researcher used the qualitative
coding software nVivo to independently analyze the transcripts and observational data. All authors discussed elements of disagreement and the refining of codes and categories as needed. In doing so, we discovered that
while entrepreneurs experienced many of the types of incubator benefits
suggested by extant research, entrepreneurs also experienced significant
constraints on their autonomy in ways that was not predicted by the existing literature. We identified three different types of threats to entrepreneurs’ autonomy: mentor role conflict, gatekeeper control, and affiliation

<-----Page 9----->286

dissonance. Incubated firms experienced mentor role conflict when there
was disagreement as to the incubator’s role as a source of expertise to the
entrepreneur. Incubated firms confronted gatekeeper control when the
incubator overstepped the boundaries of their role as a resource broker for
the entrepreneur. Finally, all incubated firms experienced affiliation dissonance, where affiliation between the entrepreneur and incubator was
viewed as no longer beneficial but rather as constraining.
We analyzed how entrepreneurs and incubator staff worked to address
these different threats to autonomy and how they crafted collaborative, but
distinct, practices to resolve them. We distinguished between the practices
that entrepreneurs and incubator staff engaged in and attended closely to
the events that ignited those practices. We maintained tables comparing
data from interviews and observations in order to triangulate across data
sources and the five firms studied. We discovered that all entrepreneurs in
our study often met with unexpected constraints imposed by the incubator
but worked to preserve their autonomy by unbundling resources from these
constraints, and we identify the conditions that enabled this process.

MANAGING AUTONOMY AND CONSTRAINT WITHIN
A BUSINESS INCUBATOR
First, we briefly describe the benefits the incubator we studied provided to
the five entrepreneurial firms, which largely confirms prior research on the
potential value that sponsoring organizations can provide. Second, and less
expected, our interviews and observational data revealed three types of
threats to autonomy that arose as entrepreneurs worked with incubator
staff. Third, we inductively identified the practices both entrepreneurs and
incubator staff used to address these threats, allowing entrepreneurs to preserve their autonomy while acquiring the resources needed to develop their
nascent ventures.

Resources and Support for Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs entered the incubator with typically three months to a year
of experience on their own. Immediately after joining the incubator, entrepreneurs reported experiencing clear benefits such as mentoring from

<-----Page 10----->Help Me Do It on My Own

287

Incupro’s professional staff, gaining access to a broader resource network,
and being seen as more legitimate by other critical stakeholders.
Expertise Mentoring
Entrepreneurs valued the mentorship they received from the Incupro director and his team. While the entrepreneurs we studied sought advice to differing degrees, we observed many examples of founders making regular use
of mentorship from the incubator staff. One incubator staff member we
interviewed noted how they tried to mentor their resident firms, stating
that: “We had a whole process that we set up to train and prepare these
people for the venture shows.” We observed Tim sharing his experience
with the founder of Worldtech, showing him how important it was to establish a set of “back-up charts” that could be called upon when pitching a
business plan to potential investors. As a further example, we observed that
the co-founder of Optico used the incubator director’s advice on many
occasions, and, upon graduation, he provided a public endorsement of
the incubator.
Resource Brokering
Entrepreneurs valued both the formal and informal resource brokering
activities that Incupro staff made available. Resource brokering occurred
formally when Incupro’s director scheduled and participated in meetings
between entrepreneurs and his network of early-stage “Angel” investors.
For example, breakfast meetings with potential Angel investors not only
helped legitimate the firms hosted by the director’s incubator, they also
served as a formal means to connect entrepreneurs to potential investors.
The founder of Worldtech noted that “one of the good things about being
here is that [Tim] introduces you to others that he feels would be an asset
to the company …. And [Tim] comes in contact with a lot of different individuals.” Resource brokering also occurred informally when Incupro
hosted well-attended roof-top cocktail parties, that allowed investors,
entrepreneurs, and other Silicon Valley professionals to interact on their
own initiatives. The founder of Worldtech reflected that he must have
“come away with probably eight or ten [business] cards” from guests at one
party. Incubator staff were instrumental at bringing their network to bear
for their entrepreneurs, with Tim, the director, stating, “You can open
doors [as an incubator for member companies] through phone calls and
e-mails. Two guys, three guys in a garage, probably wouldn’t get a return
call.” The co-founder and CEO of Optico noted that four of their initial
investors were directly from the director’s contacts.

<-----Page 11----->288

VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.

Endorsing Ventures
Entrepreneurs observed that their membership in the incubator was perceived as an endorsement which increased the legitimacy of their ventures
immediately upon joining. Incubator directors knew that this endorsement was a key resource they could provide to their ventures. One incubator director stated: “What [incubated companies] are able to say is
that … somebody has let them into their very selective incubator … [and]
is investing their time in the future success of that company.” This sentiment was seconded by the firms accepted into Incupro. As the co-founder
and CEO of Optico reflected, “So the professionalism part really kicked
in and Angel investors looked at it and said, ‘Hey, you guys look like
you [have] got momentum here.’ And the only difference was now we
went from being in the living room to being in the office …” Although
Optico’s progress toward product milestones had not changed significantly, their image in the eyes of others had, much as Zott and Huy
(2007) would predict. Similarly, the founder of Worldtech noted, “We
just put in [the incubator’s] address, and it obviously looked like we were
upgrading.” Incubator staff also actively endorsed the ventures they
hosted. At a meeting for Angel investors, the Incupro director presented
a slide with the logos of numerous “Incupro Partners” who were law
firms and venture capitalists well known in Silicon Valley. On the next
slide, the director included logos of “Incupro Companies” housed in the
incubator. By presenting the partners and ventures side-by-side, he tried
to connect these nascent ventures to more established partners in order
to increase the legitimacy of the firms he hosted. As the Co-founder and
CEO of Optico noted, “Being able to help us secure funding from angel
investors [was a benefit] because of the credibility we had [from
the incubator].”
Benefits to the Incubator Organization
Expertise mentoring, resource brokering, and endorsing ventures were three
activities that incubators provided to entrepreneurs, but these activities
benefited the incubator as well. The financial model of the incubator relied
on collecting payments in the form of rent or equity stakes in some of the
ventures they incubated. The venture capital firm that established Incupro
used the incubator as a means to gain preferential access to early-stage
investment opportunities. In return for the support the incubator provided,
investors received a close up view of the evolution of the firms for their six
months in residence which improved the efficiency of investors’ due diligence efforts.

<-----Page 12----->Help Me Do It on My Own

289

Incubator staff received non-monetary benefits from the firms they
hosted as well. By being exposed to the range of challenges facing their
entrepreneurs, Incupro staff could stay at the forefront of the relevant issues
facing start-up teams in Silicon Valley. The director of Incupro often stated
how involvement in prior ventures on current issues kept his start-up
knowledge up-to-date. By acting as a broker of resources, Incupro staff
were able to occupy structural positions that increased their relevance
within their professional network. By endorsing a range of new entrepreneurial firms, the legitimacy of the incubator could be heightened if these
firms turned out to be successful. Given the existing research on entrepreneurs and incubators, none of these benefits are particularly surprising for
either entrepreneurs or for incubator staff. All entrepreneurs were quick to
point to these three benefits as reasons to be at Incupro. What has been less
appreciated in prior research are the ways in which incubators can constrain entrepreneurs’ autonomy and how those constraints are resolved.

Bundling Resources and Constraints
Entrepreneurs soon learned that the incubator’s resources were sometimes
bundled with constraints. Expertise mentoring could be accompanied with
the expectation that the entrepreneur follow the advice given. Resource
brokering could happen with the expectation that the entrepreneur accept
funding from an investor selected by the incubator. Conferring legitimacy
by endorsing ventures in the incubator could conflate the identities of the
entrepreneur’s venture and the incubator. The incubator offered abundant
resources, but these resources could be bundled with expectations that the
entrepreneur act in accordance with the incubator’s wishes. When these
constraints materialized, Incupro’s actions compromised entrepreneurs’
autonomy over decisions critical to their ventures, threatening entrepreneurs’ ability to craft ventures independent from the incubator. As shown
in Table 1, we identified three types of threats to entrepreneurs’ autonomy:
mentor role conflict, gatekeeper control, and affiliation dissonance, which
are examined in turn.
Mentor Role Conflict
While incubator staff were viewed as capable of offering relevant expertise
and mentoring to the entrepreneurs in residence, sometimes incubator staff
overstepped the boundaries of their supporting roles. We defined mentor
role conflict as disagreement as to the incubator’s role as a source of

Observation and Interview Data

Mentor role conflict

Observation data: During a heated
discussion between Tim, the Director
of Incupro and a Co-Founder of
Optico, the founder states “You think
I travel too much” and goes on to
describe how he doesn’t appreciate
being told by Tim how to run his
company in front of his employees.
(From field notes of 9/29)
Interview data: “And so now it becomes
more of a conflict issue and so as time
has gone on, [Tim, the Director of
Incupro,] plays more of an investment
role. So now it’s more like: I’m talking
to my investors …” (Co-founder and
CEO of Optico)
Observation data: The angel investor
asked in an angry tone: “Why would
anyone want to do that?” when told
that the only way to invest was
through the incubator. The deputy
director claimed that for Geotech,
“I am basically acting as their CEO.”
(From field notes of 9/19)
Interview data: “And we had that
problem with [further funding options
presented to us by Tim], because they
both were a primary contact, their
relationship with Tim overrode their
relationship with us.” (Co-founder and
CEO of Optico)
Observation data: The Director of
Incupro distanced himself from one
failed company that used space in the
incubator, noting in a private
discussion with us that “we only
housed them, they were not an
Incupro company.” (From field notes
of 11/3)
Interview data: “Tim is very
dramatic … which is a great marketing
tool … [but investors] hate being
dramatic and [Tim’s comments]
reflects as our company being
dramatic.” (Co-founder and CEO of
Optico seeking increasing
independence from the incubator after
initial funding)

expertise as opposed to a source of direction to entrepreneurs. As the following example from Optico’s CEO demonstrates, at times, entrepreneurs
felt that the incubator staff were bundling their advice with the expectation
that entrepreneurs act on that advice even if it ran counter to how the
entrepreneur wished to run their venture.
At a critical time in the firm’s funding cycle, the Optico CEO entered
into a heated exchange with the incubator director because the director had
told Optico employees that he thought their CEO was traveling too much
when they were nearing the closing of a funding round. At the end of a
meeting in which the Optico CEO was seeking help from the Incupro director and deputy director on how to draft a fax cover sheet to a lead angel
investor, we observed the following exchange:
The computer was shut down and the three men sat in their chairs, loosely around the
table, leaning back. It was clear there was more to say, and the CEO started off that he
did want to go over something more. In his loud baritone voice, the CEO stated to Tim
“You think I travel too much,” following up with the remark that he wanted to know
why that was the case.
Tim responded that yes he had been worried about his trip last week during what he
thought would be the closing week for his funding and that he had asked the CEO’s
colleagues, “Where the [expletive] is your CEO?!”
The CEO replied that he had a few issues with how Tim responded, the first and most
important was how it made him look in front of his employees. Tim said he was sorry
to have “blown up” in front of them. Tim explained to the CEO’s employees later that
it was no big deal that [the CEO was] not around, it’s just that if I was your CEO, I
would not be away the week I was closing. (From field notes of 9/29)

The Optico CEO felt that his role as CEO of his own firm was compromised when the incubator director expressed his displeasure over the
CEO’s performance directly to Optico employees. Conflict over the boundaries of the incubator director’s role as mentor seemed to spill-over to other
members of the firm as well. Earlier that month, the other co-founder
returned to his desk after meeting with Tim, exasperated and stating “I’m
not going up [to his office] anymore.” He didn’t know how to balance the
advice of the incubator director with his team’s own opinion as to what
needed to be done to make their venture succeed. We observed repeated
episodes where incubator staff’s mentorship across broad topics was
bundled with the expectation that the entrepreneur or the founding team
act in accordance with their advice. Entrepreneurs found this expectation
to be a threat to their autonomy and to their ability to make decisions as
they saw fit.

Gatekeeper Control
Disagreement as to the incubator’s role as a resource broker for entrepreneurs led to another threat to entrepreneurs’ autonomy, as summarized in
Table 1. While entrepreneurs valued the ability of incubator staff to broker
connections to potential investors and customers, they did not want to be
obligated to use those connections. On the other hand, incubator staff realized that social capital was not necessarily a renewable resource: if they
exhausted their social networks to help one or two ventures, they might
saturate their network, compromising their ability to make future introductions. Thus, if incubator staff made an introduction, they wanted to know
what type of exchange was produced, as it might affect their ability to help
other ventures. This interest in supporting a number of ventures equally led
them to engage in gatekeeper control behaviors without realizing the effect
on individual entrepreneurs. For example, we observed one meeting the
Incupro staff brokered between the Geotech founder and potential Angel
investors where the deputy director of Incupro stated to the investor that “I
am basically acting as their CEO.” This implied to the investors that he, as
incubator staff, could make decisions on how Geotech was funded (which
was far from the case). This proved to be an on-going source of frustration
to both the Angel investor and the Geotech entrepreneur as they negotiated
the terms of a possible funding arrangement, which in the end, did not
work out. Geotech eventually received funding, not from the investor
arranged by the incubator, but from an alternative source.
When incubator staff acted as a resource broker, entrepreneurs valued
the potential connections made. But when incubator staff stepped beyond
their broker role, confusing the right to make introductions with the right
to represent the firm or make decisions on the firm’s behalf, entrepreneurs’
decision-making authority over their own ventures was compromised and
their autonomy constrained. Incubator staff were gatekeepers, ready to
introduce entrepreneurs to their rich networks in the Silicon Valley ecosystem, but when they bundled those connections with the constraint (and
expectation) that the entrepreneur use those resources as incubator staff
saw fit, entrepreneurs felt subject to gatekeeper control.
Affiliation Dissonance
A third type of threat to entrepreneurs’ autonomy arose when affiliation
between the entrepreneur and the incubator was viewed as constraining; we
refer to this as affiliation dissonance in Table 1. Early in the entrepreneur’s
relationship with the incubator, the incubator’s endorsement and affiliation
was viewed as valuable to all entrepreneurs. However, at later times,

<-----Page 16----->Help Me Do It on My Own

293

entrepreneurs experienced dissonance in their affiliation and sought to distance their ventures from the incubator, in order to assert their independence. For example, the co-founder and CEO of Optico explained that he
moved away from using his association with the incubator in later rounds
of financing, in part because: “Tim is very dramatic … which is a great
marketing tool … [but investors] hate being dramatic and that reflects as
our company being dramatic.” While his firm had made good use of
Incupro resources in their earliest stages, as the firm matured, the Optico
CEO found that bundling his venture’s affiliation with the incubator was
not necessarily in line with the identity he sought for his firm.
In summary, as entrepreneurs sought resources from the incubator, they
found these resources to be readily available, but often bundled with constraints on their use, leading to three types of threats to their autonomy:
mentor role conflict, gatekeeper control, and affiliation dissonance. As
incubator staff and entrepreneurs gained more experience working
together, they adapted their practices in order to unbundle resources from
constraints. An overview of the process is given in Fig. 1 and the practices
are detailed below.

Unbundling Resources from Constraints
Over the six-month period observed, entrepreneurs and incubator staff
made adjustments to their practices to mitigate against potential conflict.
Both parties shared a common interest in eventually creating an independent venture, even when the roles of help provider and help-seeker became
muddied so they were motivated to adapt their behavior. We found that
entrepreneurs and incubator staff relied on three sets of practices to

<-----Page 17----->294

unbundle resources from constraints and reduce threats to entrepreneurs’
autonomy. These practices had benefits for both entrepreneurs and incubator staff. We outline these practices in Table 2 and describe each set of
practices in turn.

Practices Addressing Mentor Role Conflict
Expertise mentoring at Incupro was focused on providing guidance to
entrepreneurs on how to structure, fund, and manage their ventures. Much
mentoring was done face-to-face in the director’s office, but unsolicited
advice was also distributed via regular e-mail to founders, to which we had
access. When expertise mentoring was bundled with expectations as to how
the entrepreneur should manage their firm, mentor role conflict often
emerged. To reduce mentor role conflict and create a productive relationship, each party adjusted their practices. First, entrepreneurs began to
proactively solicit help on specific business problems rather than broad
advice on their role as firm founders. Second, incubator staff began to confer ultimate decision rights to the entrepreneur and his team
especially
when they were prompted for advice.
Entrepreneurs: Seek Problem-Focused Advice
Entrepreneurs were able to receive and make the best use of the incubator’s
advice when the entrepreneur brought a specific problem to the incubator
staff and sought advice on how to address that issue. In some cases, this
entailed actually collaborating on a specific task, such as when the CEO of
Optico sought help communicating a difficult change of plans to his investor. Over the course of an hour-and-a-half, the CEO, the incubator director, and the deputy director worked out different ways to frame and
communicate the sensitive issue to the investor:
The Incupro Deputy Director asked “is there anything you need to qualify the prototype?” to which the Optico CEO replied it was ‘a good question’ and they began to
address this aspect. As the Deputy Director, Tim, and the CEO worked together to
craft phrasing for the letter, Tim said to the CEO: “Push back if you don’t agree!”
“No, no, I agree,” agreed the CEO, “but I’m concentrating on typing with three fingers!” At this point, the Deputy Director suggested he could take over the typing, as he
can touch type.
The Optico CEO began pacing as he and the Deputy Director continued to provide
much of the text; the Deputy Director had not slowed down in his input since sitting

Observation, Archival, and Interview Data
Observation data: Earlier stage companies used
their affiliation with Incupro in seeking
funding and customer contacts. When
companies were at later stages, they did not
cite Incupro in their press releases, even
though Incupro used them in their marketing
material at the same time.
Interview data: Optico co-founder noted that,
“we’ve used all of their investment contacts,
infrastructure contacts, ramp-up facility, it’s
been pretty much a great deal for us.” even
though he didn’t mention Incupro in press
when expanding.
Archival data: Incupro director sent out e-mail
touting milestones and featured successful
companies in marketing materials:
“… Geotech has a killer solution to the next
big thing in wireless!!! We hope that you can
join … in welcoming Geotech to the Senior
class at Incupro.” (e-mail of 10/13)

looking intently at the image of the letter on the screen…
All three were providing language for the “key drivers” that led to the new schedule.
There was no animosity, just high-charged focus on getting this document done. Eyes
were mostly glued to the screen. There was some discussion as to whether the reasons
for the new schedule should be termed “key drivers” or “key items” or “key differences.” (From field notes of 9/29)

Even though he had experienced mentor role conflict in the past over the
incubator’s general expectations for the CEO role, the Optico CEO now
approached incubator staff for problem-focused advice with a specific issue
of some urgency to him. Incubator staff were able to provide expertise on
the spot to help him work through a sensitive but specific quandary without conflict.

<-----Page 20----->Help Me Do It on My Own

297

We observed a similar dynamic during sessions with the founders of
Geotech, Worldtech, and Digitech. Seeking problem-focused advice also
helped incubator staff leverage their scarce resources across more firms. An
incubator director’s time and ability to help five or six firms at the same
time was limited, so priorities needed to be made: “… if you’re the CEO,
you tell me today, when we sit down, what the two or three things are that
are your biggest problems and we’ll figure out a way to help you on one of
them, and the other two are still yours.” When entrepreneurs sought
problem-focused advice, they helped incubator staff provide expertise while
maintaining the boundary of their mentor role. This also helped incubator
staff to leverage their limited resources and enable the most relevant impact
across their incubated firms.
In short, seeking problem-focused advice helped address mentor role
conflict in two ways: first the entrepreneur solicited advice rather than
receiving unsolicited advice from the incubator staff and second, the advice
sought was rooted in demand-driven situations rather than based on the
incubator’s expectation of the entrepreneur’s performance. As summarized
in Table 2, seeking problem-focused advice helped to partially address mentor
role conflict, but to actually unbundle resources from constraints, incubator
staff also needed to adjust their behavior by conferring decision rights.
Incubator Staff: Confer Decision Rights
When incubator staff reminded everyone present that the entrepreneur had
final say in addressing the venture’s issues, this helped reduce mentor role
conflict by publicly reinforcing the entrepreneur’s autonomy and bounding
the reach of the incubator’s authority. For example, in the prior example,
when Tim told the Optico CEO, “Push back if you don’t agree!” he explicitly conferred decision rights to the entrepreneur, after being approached
for advice and laying out potential courses of action. By recognizing the
entrepreneur’s right to disagree, the entrepreneur was free to engage in
extensive problem solving with both incubator staff without threat to the
entrepreneur’s autonomy. Even though Tim and the Optico CEO had previously experienced mentor role conflict when the Optico CEO traveled at a
crucial time in his firm’s funding round, both parties learned to adapt their
practices: while entrepreneurs learned to ask for problem-focused advice,
incubator staff learned to confer decision rights.
We observed this behavior unfolding in other productive exchanges over
time, such as this exchange between the founder of Digitech and the director and deputy director of Incupro evaluating whether to serve a specific customer:

<-----Page 21----->298

VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.

After the various options had been discussed for quite some time, Tim turned to the
founder of Digitech and said “Well, you’ve heard the Deputy Director’s good ideas.
What do you want to do?” This prompted a bit more discussion focused around the
founder, where he seemed to hone in on a plan asking for a limit of 1-year exclusivity.
(From field notes of 11/3)

In this instance, Tim reminded everyone in the room (including the entrepreneur) where ultimate decision authority lay. This was an approach that
he and other incubator directors reported learning over time. Conferring
decision rights helped make the mentee and mentor roles distinct and reinforced these boundaries in the moment when advice was delivered. This
practice helped mitigate mentor role conflict by removing any sense of compliance from receipt of the advice.
In sum, mentor role conflict occurred when entrepreneurs perceived that
incubator staff overstepped their role as providing expertise to entrepreneurs to direct the venture’s course of action. When entrepreneurs sought
problem-focused advice, they unbundled expertise resources from the constraint of needing to act on that advice or be subject to unsolicited advice.
Conferring decision rights helped unbundle the incubator’s expectation of
the entrepreneur from acting in accordance with the incubator’s wishes,
further supporting entrepreneurial autonomy.

Practices Addressing Gatekeeper Control
Incubator staff not only provided expertise but also acted as gatekeepers:
brokering connections with resource providers that could be valuable to
their entrepreneurs. This could create another threat to entrepreneurs’
autonomy, when incubator staff tapped their personal networks, but then
created constraints by obligating entrepreneurs to use those connections.
To reduce potential conflict stemming from gatekeeper control, incubator
staff and entrepreneurs gravitated toward practices that could help entrepreneurs learn from each other and reduce their dependence on the incubator’s network. As outlined in Table 2, we identified two specific
practices that helped reduce gatekeeper control: first, entrepreneurs cultivated peer exchanges; second, incubator staff designed forums to facilitate
peer exchange.
Entrepreneurs: Cultivate Peer Exchanges
To reduce the need for all resources and expertise to flow through incubator staff as the sole broker, and thus the threat of potential gatekeeper

<-----Page 22----->Help Me Do It on My Own

299

control, entrepreneurs asked incubator staff to help establish peer forums
for exchanging experience and resources. For example, one specific request
was for the incubator to sponsor regular pizza lunches where all entrepreneurs could gather and discuss themes of interest to them. Establishing a
regular peer forum required the director to agree and for entrepreneurs to
participate, which they regularly did. We observed three pizza lunches and
witnessed founders sharing experiences and resources on specific issues relevant to them that week, such as how to prepare for a due diligence review
by a venture capitalist. These exchanges allowed entrepreneurs to get to
know one another directly and expand each other’s networks laterally so
that they could meet informally on points of mutual interest. This practice
helped reduce the entrepreneurs’ dependence on incubator staff for
resources and added a new web of potentially rich interconnections among
the entrepreneurs themselves.
Incubator Staff: Design Forums for Peer Exchange
Incubator staff soon recognized that the time and resource constraints they
experienced as a gatekeeper could stand in the way of their ability to help
entrepreneurs. To solve this challenge, they designed forums for peer
exchange so that entrepreneurs could learn to help each other. These
exchanges also allowed the incubator to comparatively assess firms as a
group and filter their network introductions accordingly. One way in which
incubator staff facilitated peer exchange was by making the progress of
each venture visible so entrepreneurs could seek out and learn from their
peers. For example, after a few months, the incubator director started sending out a regular e-mail to all entrepreneurs, noting major milestones made
by each venture even before such information was publically available. It
was no coincidence that this practice also placed some degree of peer pressure on entrepreneurs to perform and make progress in the expected direction. In addition to e-mail updates, roof-top parties celebrating the closing
of funding rounds for each venture served not only as a means to bring
people together to broker resources but also to make visible to all incubator members which ventures were making the most progress. Incubator
staff leveraged peer exchanges to both motivate entrepreneurs’ performance
and leverage their social networks more carefully. Incubator staff wanted
to help all of their firms but they were not all equally qualified for introductions to their investor network and they could comparatively evaluate firm
performance by observing each venture’s progress through peer exchanges.
Gatekeeper control affected both parties: Entrepreneurs were worried
about being constrained to make decisions in accordance with the incubator’s

<-----Page 23----->300

VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.

introductions and incubator staff were concerned about leveraging their
time and maintaining credibility within their social network. When entrepreneurs cultivated peer exchanges and when incubator staff designed forums
to facilitate such exchanges, the threat of gatekeeper control compromising
an entrepreneur’s autonomy was reduced. Entrepreneurs learned to rely on
their peers to reduce their dependence on the incubator as the sole source of
advice and network resources. Incubator staff learned to leverage their peer
network of entrepreneurs to nudge their ventures in the desired direction
and compare firms’ relative performance from a distance. When both practices were used, the constraint of relying on the incubator’s resources was
unbundled from the support that could be gained from all incubated firms’
networks. Doing so allowed entrepreneurs access to peer resources while
preserving their autonomy and helped the incubator preserve their network resources.

Practices Addressing Affiliation Dissonance
As prior research would suggest (Zott & Huy, 2007), entrepreneurs
acknowledged that their acceptance by the incubator enhanced their legitimacy and thus their ability to attract future resources especially in their
early days. What is less appreciated is that the reputation and identities of
both the ventures incubated and the incubator itself evolved as each
became more or less successful. The success of the ventures in residence
and the incubator became temporarily connected, and this connection
could create dissonance for both parties when there was a perceived asymmetry in performance. For example, an incubator’s performance can be
tied to the ability of its firms to acquire funding and gain financial independence, attracting still more ventures to seek affiliation. When one party was
not performing as hoped, affiliation was not necessarily viewed as
beneficial
leading to affiliation dissonance. Similarly, as entrepreneurs
strove to achieve independence from the incubator, they did not always
want to acknowledge their affiliation with the incubator. In response, we
observed both entrepreneurs and incubator staff become increasingly selective in how they regarded their affiliation. These practices are summarized
in Table 2.
Entrepreneurs: Selective Affiliation
Early in their relationship with Incupro, entrepreneurs were opportunistic
in how they used their affiliation and usually found the relationship to be

<-----Page 24----->Help Me Do It on My Own

301

beneficial. However, when companies such as Geotech and Optico started
to become independent ventures, they often distanced themselves from
Incupro. For example, neither Geotech nor Optico cited their affiliation with
Incupro in their own press releases or marketing materials. This is despite
the fact that, at the same time, the director of Incupro referenced both firms
in its own marketing materials. As described in Table 2, the founder of
Optico felt that he had made very good use of Incupro’s resources while in
residence and had “sucked the incubator dry.” Now that he was venture
backed, he did not view affiliation with the incubator to be of benefit: he
had new stakeholders to concern himself with. To assert his independence,
he was selective in recognizing Optico’s affiliation with Incupro and, during
later stages, did not highlight this affiliation at all.
Incubator Staff: Select on Success
Incubator staff could not know how successful an individual entrepreneur
would be in advance, yet they needed a number of successful incubated
companies to attract future entrepreneurs to incubate. When entrepreneurs
in residence were successful in launching new ventures, the director of
Incupro made sure this was known to the community at large: selecting and
highlighting successful cases to cast the best light on Incupro. For example,
when Geotech became the first Incupro company to receive venture-backed
funding which allowed them to graduate from incubation, the director
noted in an incubator-wide e-mail that they had become part of the “senior
class” of Incupro, and made sure they were featured in Incupro’s promotional material. After Optico secured venture funding, the director secured
a long endorsement from them about the value Incupro provided to them.
The practice of selecting on success involved not just highlighting those
ventures that were successful, but also distancing the incubator from those
that failed. When a venture failed, Incupro’s director was quick to recast
their shared identity in both public and private. During our time of observation, a company that had just left the incubator “blew-up” and sold all
of its assets. When the director was asked what had happened to the company, Mega.com, he replied, “we only housed them, they were not an
Incupro company.” He deliberately distanced the incubator from firms that
did not succeed
unbundling the affiliated identities of the ventures and
the incubator when he did not want their futures to be linked. However,
prior Incupro Powerpoint presentations listed the firm as one of the first
two successful Incupro companies. A press release the following April, after
the venture failed, no longer listed it as ever having been associated with
the incubator.

<-----Page 25----->302

VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.

Affiliation dissonance arose when affiliation between the entrepreneur
and the incubator was viewed as no longer beneficial. Affiliation dissonance was more likely to occur near the end of the incubation relationship, which was always expected to be short term under the best of
circumstances. As they neared financial independence, entrepreneurs
began selectively affiliating with the incubator
acknowledging
Incupro’s support in the early days of their relationship (when they most
needed it), but they were quick to abandon affiliation at later stages.
Incubator staff opted to select on success
highlighting those firms that
received venture-backed funding and distancing their affiliation from
those ventures forced to close their doors. When entrepreneurs began
selectively affiliating with the incubator and the incubator began selecting on success, in effect, both parties unbundled their once intertwined affiliations.
In sum, incubators offered many of the resources suggested by prior
empirical and theoretical work such as expertise mentoring, resource brokering and endorsing nascent ventures. However, little prior research has
recognized how these “informal” resources are coupled with expectations as
to how entrepreneurs should manage their ventures. Given that many entrepreneurs’ pursuit of autonomy is often a key motivator to start new ventures
in the first place, it is no surprise that these implicit “strings attached” were
often experienced as threats to entrepreneurs’ autonomy. We identified three
sets of practices used by entrepreneurs and their organizational sponsors to
unbundle resources from constraints, allowing entrepreneurs to take full
advantage of the resources offered while preserving their autonomy.

DISCUSSION
Our research heeds a broader call to attend to “why, when and how different modes of action are used to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities”
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, p. 218). Recently “different modes of
action” have included the use of organizational sponsors such as incubators
and accelerators (Cohen, 2013). Despite the rise of interest in different
forms of organizational sponsorship used to support entrepreneurs (Amezcua
et al., 2013), particularly in their early stages, little scholarship has examined
the process of organizational sponsorship. Existing research has been either
focused on static attributes of incubators or incubator outcomes (e.g. Bergek &
Norrman, 2008) without examining the specific practices employed within

<-----Page 26----->Help Me Do It on My Own

303

accelerators and incubators and how they affect entrepreneurs. While the
ultimate effect of sponsorship on entrepreneurship may be contingent on the
environment (Amezcua et al, 2013), we view this context as an excellent
opportunity to examine an under-explored tension common to many entrepreneurs: How do entrepreneurs preserve their autonomy while obtaining
resources from others?
Much research has examined the importance of gathering resources to
support nascent ventures (Zott & Huy, 2007), but how informal constraints
or “strings” are attached to the resources acquired affects entrepreneurs
has escaped scholars’ attention. As Rindova and colleagues stated, “understanding the constraints that entrepreneuring individuals seek to overcome
may give us better insights into the process through which entrepreneurs
create [the development of opportunities]” (2009, p. 482). Our objective
was to understand the constraints entrepreneurs encountered in a sponsoring organization and the strategies employed to deal with such constraints.
An incubator offered an ideal context to study this phenomena, where several entrepreneurs with the ultimate goal of creating independent startups
were in residence for a temporary period. While much research has extolled
the benefits of incubators (Hansen et al., 2000), little research has examined
how incubators can constrain as well as support entrepreneurs in their
launch of new ventures. Our study specifically examined how both entrepreneurs and incubator staff experienced challenges arising from the incubator relationship and three types of threats to entrepreneurs’ autonomy
that precipitated action.
To address mentor role conflict, entrepreneurs solicited problem-focused
advice and incubator staff conferred decision rights to the entrepreneur.
When both parties made this adjustment, they unbundled the incubator’s
expertise from the constraint of needing to act on that expertise. To reduce
gatekeeper control, entrepreneurs cultivated peer exchanges and incubator
staff designed forums for peer exchange. When both parties made this
adjustment, the constraint of relying on the incubator’s network of
resources was unbundled from the support that could be gained from peers,
enabling entrepreneurs to preserve their autonomy when making decisions
and relieving pressure on the incubator’s social network. Peer forums also
helped the incubator more selectively identify which firms were ready for
preferential access to the incubator’s network of resources so as not to over
tap their network. To address affiliation dissonance, entrepreneurs selectively affiliated with the incubator early in their relationship while distancing themselves at later stages. When incubators selected on success, they
were the ones doing the distancing to create a coherent narrative of success.

Put together, our research contributes an understanding of the process
by which entrepreneurs and business incubator staff navigated constraints
to craft distinct but mutualistic roles. Although entrepreneurs and incubators shared common goals, this was not always an easy process but one
marked by tension, difficult conversations, and sometimes outright conflict.
Our grounded theoretical explanation shows how organizational sponsors
are vocal stakeholders and help-givers in the entrepreneurial venturing process, subject to the type of conflict common to most organizations (Barley,
1991). By studying the messiness of organizational life in situ as it unfolds,
we learned how the implicit “strings attached” to the resources allocated to
new ventures emerge and how they can be unbundled only when both helpgivers and help-seekers adjust their practices. Through a process of mutual
adjustment, both entrepreneurs and incubator staff learned to adapt their
practices to reduce if not prevent threats to autonomy and enable both parties to gain benefits from collaboration. Understanding this process is critical, as the resources that incubators provide entrepreneurs emerge through
a social process, unlike direct capital investments to entrepreneurs. Thus,
the process of obtaining resources from organizational sponsors with
embedded processes such as incubators or accelerators requires an understanding of how help-seeking and help-giving intersect.
Much research on help-giving has focused on individual attributes predicting what type of person is more likely to help another (Flynn & Lake,
2008; Grodal, Nelson, & Siino, 2015). Help is often viewed as a simple binary equation: it is either offered or not. When work is complex and interdependent, Grodal and colleagues show how help-giving and help-seeking
become intertwined, recasting “help-seeking and help-giving as an interdependent process in which both the help-seeker and the help-giver use cognitive and emotional moves to engage others” (2015, p. 136). In their study
of a large technology company, they found helping was not costly nor rare
but a common organizational routine, much as we observed in the incubator we studied. In their setting, help-seekers needed to attract help through
cognitive and social engagement (Grodal et al., 2015).
However, in our study, help-seekers often suffered from the reverse problem: over engagement from help-givers. For example, help-seekers had to
learn to narrow their scope and help-givers needed to learn to bound their
engagement in order for the help to be received without spurring mentor
role conflict. These differences point to the role of organizational context
and in understanding the delivering of help, as a type of resource, as an
organizationally embedded process (Grant & Ashford, 2008). The delivery
of help occurs through a type of exchange
with potential costs and

<-----Page 28----->Help Me Do It on My Own

305

benefits to both parties. Our research suggests that merely co-locating a
help-seeker and a help-giver in one physical place is unlikely on its own to
lead to a fruitful collaboration between organizational sponsors and entrepreneurs without mutual adaptation
as new social routines will need to
form. This was especially true in our study which took place in a recentlyestablished incubator; more experienced incubators may be able to leverage
more established help routines.
Second, we inductively identified the practices that allowed entrepreneurs to unbundle resources from constraints in a way that addressed
threats to entrepreneurial autonomy. As illustrated in Fig. 1, entrepreneurs
are drawn to incubators for the resources they can provide. When constraints on these resources were discovered, both entrepreneurs and incubators engaged in mutual adjustment and through this process, entrepreneurs
were able to realize the benefits associated with an incubator organization.
Prior research on incubators has not recognized the organizational constraints that incubators can place on those most motivated to start their
own organizations. The process of unbundling resources from constraints
helped the entrepreneurs and incubator staff we studied more clearly define
their respective roles and achieve collaborative outcomes: entrepreneurs
maintained autonomy over decisions unique to their ventures and incubators become better positioned to host successive entrepreneurs.
Even though organizational sponsors such as incubators and accelerators have received increasing levels of attention, relatively little research has
examined the processes that take place within these organizations. Yet, it is
the helpful interactions within incubators and accelerators that is proposed
to be the primary engine of value creation helping to transform nascent
ideas into independent ventures. The underlying premise is that the mentoring, endorsement, and preferential network access offered by sponsoring
organizations is far more important than just the physical space alone.
Without better explanation of how the internal processes within sponsoring
organizations occur, we can say little about the mechanisms that promote
value creation. By explaining how these internal processes of exchange and
support work as well as where they fail, we are better positioned to explain
how entrepreneurs and incubator staff can maximize the joint value created
as well as the conditions under which such relationships are likely to fail.
Our third contribution is to provide a model that explains when entrepreneurs are likely to falter in their quest for both resources and
autonomy
and therefore how best to avoid such outcomes. We charted
the process by which entrepreneurs and incubator staff unbundled
resources from constraints in ways that were beneficial to our setting of

<-----Page 29----->306

entrepreneurs in a single incubator. However, the process points to two
ways in which entrepreneurs can also fail. First, entrepreneurs may gain all
the resources they need through an incubator, but if they fail to unbundle
those resources from constraints, they may become entangled in the
“strings attached” and find it difficult to establish autonomy for themselves
or independence for their venture. While not found in our sample of incubated ventures, such firms termed “walking wounded” in the parlance of
some incubator managers
do gather resources, but never gain the foothold of independence needed to establish themselves as viable organizations. Second, entrepreneurs may encounter conflict and fail to adapt their
practices, instead disconnecting from the incubator and failing to acquire
the resources needed for the sake of preserving their independence. In this
case, the incubator’s value to the entrepreneur is not realized, and the
entrepreneur will be unlikely to capture the returns sponsoring organizations are capable of providing. While we did not have evidence of either
type of failure in our setting, with the process model we induced, we can
identify where a breakdown could occur if resources could not be fully
unbundled from constraints through a process of mutual adjustment.
Our research has implications for a range of other sponsoring organizations such as university spin-out facilities hosting scientist founders, writer’s
workshops hosting aspiring novelists, and scientific institutions hosting
post-doctoral scholars. Writers’ workshops, such as the famous Iowa
Writers’ Workshop, provide a temporary home where aspiring novelists
can work in a community to develop their craft (Dana, 1999). For example,
an aspiring novelist may receive expert mentoring on her style of writing,
develop a network of contacts to agents, and earn legitimacy in the eyes of
publishers through affiliation with the workshop. Yet, writers “in residence” still need to develop their own distinctive voice and style within this
context. As another example of a sponsoring organization, post-doctoral
students in research laboratories receive mentoring while developing their
own individual skills and expertise in preparation to be an independentlyfunded researcher (Leshner, 2012; Radetsky, 1994). In both settings, individuals seeking professional autonomy are receiving resources and support
from sponsoring organizations and may face many of the potential sources
of constraint identified in our research.
Thus, we would expect a similar process of unbundling resources from
constraints to occur as individuals and their sponsors navigate their roles.
Our findings also have implications for entrepreneurs who work within
existing firms. Those who aspire to be entrepreneurial in leading new
ventures within their firm may employ similar strategies, engaging in

<-----Page 30----->307

problem-focused mentoring with senior executives as a means to test out
ideas; establishing peer exchanges among other individuals in the organization as a means to evaluate opportunities and selectively using their affiliation with the broader firm to gain additional outside resources.

CONCLUSION
Entrepreneurs in sponsoring organizations, such as business incubators,
can gain resources and help, but such support may lie within a web of
informal constraints. The process of unbundling resources from these constraints is an aspect of much working life, but it is perhaps highlighted
starkly in the context of nascent ventures and sponsoring organizations.
Many workers seek a degree of autonomy in their work, and entrepreneurs
are but one example. By examining the process by which threats to autonomy are addressed in a business incubator, we have provided a window
into distinct modes of adjustment likely to take place in differing degrees
across increasingly varied modes of working and across changing workplace settings.
