Abstract. Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods,
which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values.
Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily
interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly
splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical
value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of
the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids
exploration and understanding.
Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of
patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad
range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2)
invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables; (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing
values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an
alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis
of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival
models.
We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian
central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia)
and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that
dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types,
each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat
definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these taxa.
When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of
abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus
effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available.
Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of
these data and show how linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.

INTRODUCTION

Ecological data are often complex, unbalanced, and
contain missing values. Relationships between variables may be strongly nonlinear and involve high-order
interactions. The commonly used exploratory and statistical modeling techniques often fail to find meaningful ecological patterns from such data. Classification and regression trees (Breiman et al. 1984, Clark
and Pregibon 1992, Ripley 1996) are modern statistical
techniques ideally suited for both exploring and modeling such data, but have seldom been used in ecology
(Staub et al. 1992, Baker 1993, Rejwan et al. 1999).

by one or more explanatory variables. The response
variable is usually either categorical (classification
trees) or numeric (regression trees), and the explanatory variables can be categorical and/or numeric. The
tree is constructed by repeatedly splitting the data, defined by a simple rule based on a single explanatory
variable. At each split the data is partitioned into two
mutually exclusive groups, each of which is as homogeneous as possible. The splitting procedure is then
applied to each group separately. The objective is to
partition the response into homogeneous groups, but
also to keep the tree reasonably small. The size of a
tree equals the number of final groups. Splitting is continued until an overlarge tree is grown, which is then
pruned back to the desired size. Each group is typically
characterized by either the distribution (categorical response) or mean value (numeric response) of the re-

sponse variable, group size, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it.
The way that explanatory variables are used to form
splits depends on their type. For a categorical explanatory variable with two levels, only one split is possible, with each level defining a group. For categorical
variables with >2 levels, any combinations of levels
can be used to form a split, and for k levels, there are
2k-I -

1 possible

splits. For numeric explanatory

var-

iables, a split is defined by values less than, and greater
than, some chosen value. Thus, only the rank order of
numeric variables determines a split, and for u unique
values there are u - 1 possible splits. From all possible
splits of all explanatory variables, we select the one
that maximizes the homogeneity of the two resulting
groups. Homogeneity can be defined in many ways,
with the choice depending on the type of response variable.
Trees are represented graphically, with the root node,
which represents the undivided data, at the top, and the
branches and leaves (each leaf represents one of the
final groups) beneath. Additional information can be
displayed on the tree, e.g., summary statistics of nodes,
or distributional plots.
We will show how trees can deal with complex ecological data sets using soft coral (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) survey data from the Australian central Great
Barrier Reef. This, together with a detailed exposition
of trees, follows this introduction. First, we describe
the soft coral survey data, and ecological issues that
we investigate with trees. We then illustrate the basics
of classification and regression trees with two analyses
of a soft coral species. A more detailed discussion of
trees follows, and includes: (1) exploration, description, and prediction of data; (2) technical aspects of
growing trees with different splitting criteria; (3) pruning trees to size by cross-validation; and (4) data transformations, missing values, and tree diagnostics. Tree
analyses of the soft coral data then address the following ecological issues: (1) relationships between physical and spatial environmental variables, (2) habitat
characteristics associated with aggregations of three
soft coral taxa, and (3) comparison of physical and
spatial variables as predictors of soft coral abundance.
Finally, we compare the performance of trees to equivalent linear model analyses.
THE SOFT CORAL STUDY

Soft corals (class Anthozoa, Octocorallia: Order Alcyonacea) occur in high abundances on many types of
coral reefs. They can numerically dominate reefs in
turbid nearshore regions, as well as in clear water reefs
away from coastal influences (Dinesen 1983, Fabricius
1997). Abundances of soft corals are strongly related
to their physical environment (Fabricius and De'ath
1997), but their role in reef communities is not well
understood.
We analyze three groups of taxa: (1) Efflatounaria

3179

(family Xeniidae) comprises three species (Gohar
1939, Versefeldt 1977) which are not reliably distinguished; (2) Sinularia spp. (family Alcyoniidae; Versefeldt 1980) comprises five ill-defined species with
very similar morphology and distribution, and includes
S. capitalis and S. polydactyla; and (3) the distinct
species Sinularia flexibilis (Versefeldt 1980).
Efflatounaria is locally dominant in clear offshore
waters, whereas Sinularia spp. and S. flexibilis are highly abundant and conspicuous nearshore taxa. They can
form dense aggregations, to the extent of monopolizing
space and excluding the reef-building hard corals on
the scale of thousands of square meters (Fabricius
1998).
Additionally, we use Asterospicularia laurae (family
Asterospiculariidae; Utinomi 1951) as an example of
an uncommon species. It is one of the few soft corals
that are reliably identified to species level in the field.
Zonations along the gradients of depth and distance
to land have been extensively used to explain patterns
in abundances of individual taxa on the Great Barrier
Reef (Done 1982, Dinesen 1983). However, spatial variables are only proxies for a range of physical environmental variables, with which they are highly correlated. The relationships between spatial and physical
variables are often complex. Hence the question of
which physical variables determine the distribution of
a taxon often remains unresolved-a question we attempt to address in this study.
Data comprising abundances of 38 genera of soft
coral, four physical and five spatial variables (Table 1),
were collected during surveys of 374 sites at 92 locations on 32 reefs within the Australian central Great
Barrier Reef (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Each site was visually
surveyed by one experienced observer (K. Fabricius),
by scuba diving over typically 300-500 m (- 9002000 m2), for 15-20 min, within each of five defined
depth ranges. The distribution of sites was highly unbalanced with respect to their defining characteristics
(Table 2).

A regression tree example
As an illustrative example, we use the ratings of
abundances (row 1 of Table 1) of Asterospicularia laurae as the numeric response variable (Fig. 2a). The
species is uncommon, occurring on 15% of sites (mean
rating = 0.241, n = 373) with <1% of sites having a
rating >2. The explanatory variables used in the model
are cross-shelf position, location, and depth; all of
which appear in the tree. Splits minimize the sums of
squares (ss) within groups. The first split is based on
shelf position, with inner- and mid-shelf reefs in the
left branch, and outer-shelf reefs in the right branch.
The left node is strongly homogeneous, and is not subsequently divided, forming a leaf with mean rating of

0.038. For regression trees, the proportion of the total
sum of squares explained by each split is important
information, and could be displayed on the tree. However, we can also represent this graphically by the relative lengths of the vertical lines associated with each
split (Fig. 2a); a practice we use for all trees in this
paper. Continuing with the right branch comprising all
outer reefs, it is now divided into back and flank reef
locations to the left and front locations to the right;
there are no channel sites on outer-shelf reefs. The
splitting process is repeated, separating front-reef sites
of depths above and below 3 m, which completes the
tree with four leaves, and 49.2% of the total sum of
squares is explained. The bar charts at each leaf show
the distribution of observed ratings (0-3). They show
A. laurae to be relatively common on the fronts of
outer-shelf reefs, particularly at depths ?3 m, but virtually absent from inner- and mid-shelf reefs.

A classification tree example
For the example in Fig.,2b, the response variable is
the presence-absence of A. laurae. In this case, the tree
is identical in structure to the regression tree, but the
splits have relatively different strengths, as represented
by their vertical lengths. Splits are based on the proportions of presences and absences in the groups. The
leaves of the tree are characterized by their dominant
category (present or absent), and the proportion of sites
of that category; e.g., for the leftmost leaf, A. laurae
is absent on 97% of inner and mid-shelf reefs (n =
263). When the response has more than two categories,
leaves are characterized by their dominant category and
the proportions in each category. A classification tree,
treating the ratings of A. laurae as four distinct categories (not shown), gave identical leaves to the presence-absence tree, but had a stronger split for depth.

Notes: Due to the varying structure of reefs and survey constraints, the distribution of sites with respect to these four
spatial characteristics is highly unbalanced. In particular: (1) fringing reefs, and thus channel sites, occur only on the inner
shelf, (2) flanks are underrepresented, (3) depths of 1-8 m are overrepresented on inner fringing reefs, and (4) depths of >8
m are overrepresented on outer reefs.

The proportion of total ss explained by the tree is
useful for summarizing regression trees, but, for classification trees, misclassification
rates are used. For the
whole tree, 34 out of 373 cases were misclassified,
giving an error rate of 9.1%. This compares with 50%
for "blind guessing," and 15% when we use the "go
with the majority rule," in this case predict A. laurae
to be absent on all sites.

its values that determine the split. For each of the four leaves (terminal nodes), the distribution of the observed values of
A. laurae is shown in a histogram. Each node is labeled with the mean rating and number of observations in the group (italic,

complex relationships in data. Modeling often has one
of two objectives: (1) description, in the sense that a
model represents the systematic structure of the data
as simply as possible, and (2) prediction, in that a model accurately predicts unobserved data. Trees can be
used for both description and prediction.
Modeling requires the selection of one or more likely
models from a range of possible alternatives, e.g., selecting which variables to include in a linear regression
model. The methods available for model selection are
numerous (Ripley 1996, Anderson and Burnham 1998),
and depend on whether the objective is description or
prediction.
Descriptive models can be selected by the two following methods:
1) Iterative comparison of nested models using hypothesis tests; e.g., forward, backward, and stepwise
regression. Though a widely used method, the use of
hypothesis tests for model selection has been increasingly questioned (Berger and Sellke 1987, Draper
1995, Stewart-Oaten 1996, Johnson 1999). For example, linear regression models selected by iterative
hypothesis tests consistently include too many explanatory variables (Draper 1995).
2) Selection of the model with lowest true error
(Breiman et al. 1984); also known as prediction error
(Efron and Tibshirani 1993, Ripley 1996). For least
squares regression, the prediction error of a model is
defined as the expected squared error for new predictions, and for classification as the probability of misclassifying new observations. Obtaining realistic estimates of prediction error can be difficult. For example,
the mean square error of least squares models (the resubstitution estimate of prediction error) gives overoptimistic estimates of error; an optimism that increases with model complexity. To counter this problem, we
can either: (a) add a penalty for complexity; selection
criteria such as Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC)
(Sakamoto et al. 1986) and Bayes Information Criteria
(BIC) (Schwarz 1978) adopt this approach; or (b) obtain more accurate estimates of the prediction error;
cross-validation (Ripley 1996) and bootstrapping (Efron and Tibshirani 1993) are widely used for this approach.
Predictive models are selected on their accuracy of
predictions for new data. Although we can select a
single best model, predictive accuracy can be improved
by averaging weighted predictions over several models,
with the weights being the plausibility of the individual
models (Draper 1995, Ripley 1996). Cross-validation
(Breiman et al. 1984, Ripley 1996) is a widely used
technique for selecting predictive models.

groups is equivalent to minimizing their impurity.
Many measures of impurity (splitting criteria) exist,
and enable us to analyze many types of responses.
There are five commonly used measures (Breiman et
al. 1984); three for classification trees and two for regression trees.
For classification trees, impurity is defined in terms
the proportions, c, of responses in each category. The
three common criteria (indices) are:
1) The information (entropy) index takes the form
-E c ln(c), where E indicates summation over categories. This index is identical to the Shannon-Weiner
diversity index, and forms groups by minimizing the
within-group diversity.
c2. At each
2) The Gini index takes the form I1 split, the Gini index tends to split off the largest category into a separate group, whereas the information
index tends to form groups comprising more than one
category in the early splits.
3) The twoing index can be used for more than two
categories. It defines two "super categories" at each
split, for which the impurity is defined by the Gini
index. It can also be used for ordered categories.
For regression trees, the two common forms of impurity are:
1) Sums of squares about the group means. This is
equivalent to least squares linear models.
2) Sums of absolute deviations about the median.
This gives a robust tree (Breiman et al. 1984). However,
for ecological data dominated by zeros, this criterion
can be ineffective, especially when the explanatory variables are categorical. In such cases all possible splits
may result in groups with zero medians, and no splits
will be formed.
Although the above measures are most commonly
used, others include: (1) rank statistics, which result in
invariance of the tree to any monotonic transformation
of the response variable (Segal 1988), and (2) survival
statistics for censored data (Segal 1988; T. Therneau,
unpublished manuscript).
Trees can also be formulated as statistical models,
akin to linear, generalized linear and generalized additive models (Clark and Pregibon 1992). In this approach, splits are based on an explicit statistical model,
the deviance of which defines the dissimilarity measure. For classification trees, they use a multinomial
model, equivalent to the information index, with the
deviance defined by the multinomial log-likelihood.
For regression trees, Clark and Pregibon (1992) use the
Gaussian model, and the deviance for a node is simply
the sums of squares about the mean. Summing over all
leaves gives the overall deviance for the tree.

Growing trees and splitting criteria

Pruning trees

The homogeneity of nodes is defined by impurity, a
measure which takes the value zero for completely homogeneous nodes, and increases as homogeneity decreases. Thus maximizing the homogeneity of the

A natural way of using a splitting criterion to grow
a tree is to continue splitting until the improvement
due to additional splits is less than a prespecified cutoff,
and then take this as the best tree. The foundational

<-----Page 6----->November2000

CLASSIFICATIONAND REGRESSIONTREES

work of Breiman et al. (1984) points out two weaknesses of this approach. First, if the stopping rule is
based on too small an improvement, then an overlarge
tree will result. Second, if the criterion is too large,
then splits based on interactions between explanatory
variables will not be discovered unless at least one of
the associated main effects is large enough to generate
a split.
Breiman et al. (1984) introduce three basic ideas to
solve the problem of finding the best tree. The first idea
is tree pruning: rather than stop growth in progress,
they grow an over-large tree and then seek ways to cut
it back. This can be computationally infeasible, since
the number of sub-trees is usually very large. To overcome this problem, their second idea is to find a sequence of nested trees of decreasing size, each of which
is the best of all trees of its size. For this they use the
resubstitution estimate of error, R(T), which can be either the overall misclassification rate or the total residual ss, dependent on the type of tree. They show
that, for any number a (?0) there is a unique smallest
tree that minimizes R(T) + |T|I,where |TIis tree size
(number of leaves). By allowing a to increase from 0
to large, we obtain the desired sequence of nested trees
of decreasing size, beginning with the initial overlarge
tree and ending with the root tree with no splits at all.
Since each tree in this sequence is the best of its size,
choosing the best tree is reduced to the task of choosing
the best size, a much simpler task than comparing all
possible subtrees. R(T) is not suitable for this choice
because it will always be minimized by the largest tree
(just as adding more explanatory variables reduces the
residual ss of a regression). Thus, to complete the process, we require better estimates of error, and the third
idea of Breiman et al. (1984) is to obtain "honest"
estimates of error by cross-validation, as described in
Selecting tree size by cross-validation. This can be
computationally demanding, but is now feasible since
we only have to consider one tree of each size, i.e., the
trees of the nested sequence.
Selecting tree size by cross-validation
We have noted that descriptive models can be based
on: (1) iterative comparisons between models, (2) model fit with a penalty for complexity, or (3) accurate
estimates of prediction error. Selection of trees by either iterative comparisons or penalized complexity is
ineffective (Clark and Pregibon 1992, Venables and
Ripley 1999), and thus we require a method that accurately estimates prediction error.
Breiman et al. (1984) use cross-validation to obtain
honest estimates of true (prediction) error for trees of
a given size. For the sequence of trees, these estimates
of error can be plotted against tree size, and the size
with the minimum error selected. A single tree selected
by cross-validation can be used for description and/or
prediction. It should be interpreted as the tree which

3183

has the smallest estimated error and is the best estimated predictive single tree.
Cross-validation can be implemented in two ways.
First, if enough data are available, we select a random
subset of the data, typically comprising one-half to twothirds of all data, and, using only this data, build the
sequence of nested trees. For each tree, predict the
response of the remaining data, and calculate the error
from the predictions and the observed values. The tree
with the smallest predicted error is then selected. One
drawback of this technique is that there are often insufficient data to build good trees using only a subset
of the data. The second way is to use V-fold crossvalidation as follows: (1) divide the data into a number,
V, of mutually exclusive subsets (typically V = 10) of
approximately equal size; (2) drop out each subset in
turn, build a tree using data from the remaining subsets,
and use it to predict the responses for the omitted subset; (3) calculate the estimated error for each subset
(e.g., for a sums of squares regression tree, the error
is the sum of squared differences of the observations
and predictions), and sum over all subsets; (4) repeat
steps (2)-(3) for each size of tree; and (5) select the
tree with the smallest estimated error rate. The subsets
can be chosen randomly, but stratification into groups
according to the value of the response variable gives
smaller and more accurate estimates of the true error
rate (Breiman et al. 1984).
When we have subsampling in the data, e.g., when
we make repeated observations on the sampling units,
then subsamples within units are usually correlated. Vfold cross-validation needs to be modified for such
data, otherwise: (1) predictions of error rates are overoptimistic (Fig. 3), due to the fact that we would be
using observations within a sampling unit to predict
other values of the same unit; and (2) tree sizes tend
to be overestimated (Fig. 3). We can overcome this
problem by selecting only whole sampling units in our
subsets, and thus units are predicted from other units.
If the number of sampling units is large, each subset
will contain several complete units, but if the number
is -<V, then each subset will comprise a single complete
unit. Bootstrap procedures (Efron and Tibshirani 1993)
have been modified in this way, but to our knowledge,
cross-validation procedures have not.
For the nested sequence of trees, the difference between resubstitution and cross-validated estimates of
error often increases with tree size (Fig. 3), with the
latter often rapidly dropping to a minimum followed
by a slow increase. If this plateau effect occurs, the
tree size corresponding to the minimum error is imprecisely estimated.
Breiman et al. (1984) suggested the 1-SErule whereby the best tree is taken as the smallest tree such that
its estimated error rate is within one standard error of
the minimum. The standard error of the estimate (Breiman et al. 1984) can be calculated for each tree size
(Fig. 3). Use of the 1-SE rule can result in a much

smoother cross-validation curve from which the tree
size can be selected according to either rule. We prefer
the latter strategy, but it is difficult to implement for
the available software.
If the objective of the analysis is prediction, then
averaging over a collection of trees gives better performance (Ripley 1996). This can be done using these
steps: (1) run a series of cross-validations, (2) select a
tree from each cross-validation according to the minimum rule, (3) for each tree predict for the new data,
and (4) average the predictions over the trees.

For a numeric explanatory variable, x, only its rank
order determines a split, i.e., the groups are defined by
x > Xs and x < xs, where xs maximizes their homogeneity. Trees are thus invariant to monotonic transformations of numeric explanatory variables. Hence, we
do not have to deal with the difficult issue of the form
of relationship between the response and numeric explanatory variables (e.g., linear-linear, log-log, linearpolynomial). However, for a strong linear (or smooth)
relationship, regression trees will not perform as well
as linear regression (or non- or semiparametric smoothers). For some splitting criteria, e.g., those based on
ranks, trees are also invariant to monotonic transformations of the response variable (Breiman et al. 1984,
Segal 1988). For regression trees based on sums of
squares or sums of absolute deviations, residual plots
are useful to check for outliers, and to show how variation of the response is related to mean values of the
groups. Nonconstant variation gives greater weight to
data with higher variation, and therefore it is often
desirable to transform the response variable.

Missing data are a common occurrence in ecological
studies, and for many types of models they can be
problematic (Little and Rubin 1987). Cases with missing responses, or with missing explanatory variables
are often deleted. This results in loss of information
and possible bias. Alternatively, missing data can be
replaced by some form of imputation, e.g., replacement
by the mean value, but this too can result in bias. Trees
handle missing data in a variety of ways. For regression
trees, cases with missing responses are deleted, but for
classification trees, the missing responses can be treated as a special category (Clark and Pregibon 1992),
thereby providing information on response bias. If an
explanatory variable used to form a split has missing
values, we can either stop cases with missing values
at the split, and give them the characteristic response
value of all cases that pass through that node; or send
them further down the tree, using an explanatory variable with nonmissing values for these cases. We
choose the variable that best agrees with the original
splitting variable, and quantify its performance by the
percentage agreement in the allocation of cases to the

information loss, which can render the case deletion
approach unworkable when a large proportion of data
are missing.
Alternative splits
The use of alternative splits can be used both as an
exploratory technique, and also to generate alternative

trees. For each split, we can compare the strength of
the split due to the selected variable with the best splits
of each of the remaining explanatory variables. A
strongly competing alternative variable can be substituted for the original variable, and this can sometimes
simplify a tree by reducing the number of explanatory
variables, or, as we show later, lead to a better tree.

Regression trees explaining the abundances of the soft coral taxa Efflatounaria, Sinularia spp., and Sinularia

(sediment, visibility, waves, and slope). At the bottom of the cross-validation plots (a, d, g), the bar charts show the relative
proportions of trees of each size selected under the 1-SE rule (gray) and minimum rules (white) from a series of 50 crossvalidations. For Efflatounaria (a), a five-leaf tree is most likely by either the 1-SE or the minimum rule. For Sinularia spp.
(d), five to eight-leaf trees have support, and for S. flexibilis (g), five- to nine-leaf trees have support. Cross-validation plots
(a, d, g), representative of the modal choice for each taxa according to the 1-SE rule, are also shown. For all three taxa, a
five-leaf tree was selected (c, f, i). The shaded ellipses enclose nodes pruned from the full trees (b, e, h), each of which
accounted for >99% of the total ss.

alternative splits and surrogate variables can lead to a
more complete understanding of dependencies and relationships within the data.
STATISTICALANALYSES

All data analyses presented in this paper used S-Plus
statistical software (Statistical Sciences, 1999). The library of tree routines (RPART: Recursive PARTitioning) developed by T. Therneau (unpublished manuscript) was used for all classification and regression
tree analyses. For all tree analyses, models were selected by cross-validation. For each tree, we ran a series
of 50 10-fold cross-validations and chose the most frequently occurring tree size using the 1-SE rule (see
Selecting tree size by cross-validation above). Typical
cross-validations are shown in the results, each selecting the modal-size tree.
For all tree analyses, reefs were the sampling units,
and hence reef identity was not used in the same way
as other spatial and environmental variables. Reefs
were not included in the models as explanatory variables, but were used to form the subsets for the crossvalidations (see Selecting tree size by cross-validation
above).

ANALYSIS

OF THE SOFT CORAL DATA USING TREES

Exploring relationships between physical
and spatial variables
Classification and regression trees were used to analyze the relationships between each of the four physical variables and the four spatial variables. The responses of sediment and wave action were analyzed
using both types of tree. For both responses, the classification and regression trees were highly similar, suggesting the categories were behaving as numerical variables. Only the regression trees are presented in the
results (Fig. 4a and c). The data for visibility and slopes
were fourth-root and square-root transformed, respectively, to stabilize the variance at the leaves. The means
of these variables shown on the trees (Fig. 4b and d)
were back transformed to assist interpretation.
Visibility and sediment levels were best explained
(R2 = 66.7 and 56.4% respectively) by the spatial variables, whereas wave action and slope were less well
explained (R2 = 34.1 and 39.3%) (Fig. 4). This is possibly due to high temporal variation of waves and high
local variation in slopes. Cross-shelf position, followed
by depth, were consistently the strongest explanatory
variables of the physical variables (Fig. 4).

Predicting abundances and habitat characteristics
of taxa
We used regression trees to relate abundances of Effiatounaria, Sinularia spp., and S. flexibilis to the spatial and physical environmental variables. For each of
these taxa, cross-validation using the 1-SE rule selected
a five-leaf tree (Fig. 5a, d, and g). The choice for Efflatounaria was clear from both the cross-validation
plot and the full tree (Fig. 5a and b), with the selected
tree explaining 67.7% of the total ss. For Sinularia
spp. and Sinulariaflexibilis the evidence was less clearcut, with trees from four to ten leaves receiving support
(Fig. 5d and e). Five-leaf trees were selected for both
taxa, which explained 58.2% of the total ss for Sinularia spp., and 55.4% for Sinularia flexibilis. The fact
that a particular size of tree was not favored over all
others for Sinularia spp. is not a weakness of the crossvalidation procedure, but simply reflects the fact that
several models were almost equally plausible. This situation also occurs for other types of statistical models,
such as linear models, and neatly illustrates that blind
adherence to any single model selection procedure, be
it 1-SE for trees, or P < 0.05 for linear models, is not
the most informative strategy. Both the cross-validation
and the full tree plots are useful in assessing the certainty with which a particular model is chosen.
High abundances of all three taxa were restricted to
a narrow set of environmental conditions. Efflatounaria
occurred on only one of 189 inner-reef sites (Fig. 5c)
and was relatively rare on mid-shelf sites (mean rating:
0.38, n = 74), compared with outer-shelf sites (1.86,
n = 110). Abundance was highest (2.8, n = 41) on
outer-shelf sites of -3 m water depth on terraces with
slopes < 35?. Sinularia spp. was most abundant (mean
rating = 2.7, n = 72) on sites of intermediate visibility
(6.5-14 m), with depths <8 m, and at least some sediment (Fig. 5f). These are largely inner-shelf sites (Fig.
4b). Sinularia flexibilis (Fig. 5i) was most abundant in
channels (mean rating = 3.04, n = 49). These are innershelf sites with gentle slopes (Fig. 4d) and low wave
action (Fig. 4c). It also had high abundances (mean
rating 2.4, n = 37) at intermediate depths (1-8 m) on
fringing reefs where visibility was -5.5 m.
Surrogates and alternative splits were examined to
better understand the relative effects of physical and
spatial variables. Visibility was a strong surrogate and
alternative split for shelf position and vice versa, in
agreement with Fig. 4b. For example, dropping shelf
from the Efflatounaria model resulted in a five-leaf tree
with the same splits (Fig. 5c), but with visibility replacing shelf, and explained only marginally less of the
total ss (65.4 vs. 67.7%). The surrogate and alternative
splits relating other physical and spatial variables were
weaker and less consistent.
Inspection of alternative splits led to a stronger tree
for Sinularia spp.. The initial tree used reef type for
the first split, however, visibility was a strong alter-

native split, and when reef type was dropped from the
model, the resulting tree better explained the data (58.0
vs. 53.5%) for a same-size tree.
The analyses above clearly identified habitats of high
abundance. They also showed how examination of surrogates and alternative splits can lead to a more complete understanding of competing explanatory variables and better (or simpler) models when explanatory
variables with strong surrogates are dropped from the
models.
Physical or spatial determinants of abundance?
In order to explore the degree to which the groups
of physical and spatial variables separately explained
abundance, the three taxa were also analyzed using
regression trees based on each group of variables separately. The comparisons (Table 3) show that trees of
size five were selected for most analyses, differing at
most by one from this size. Spatial variables both explained and predicted Efflatounaria marginally better
than the physical variables, whereas for Sinularia spp.
and S. flexibilis the reverse was true. The degree to
which either of the physical or the spatial data explained the abundances of all three taxa was on average
only 4% less than the combined physical-spatial data.
The explanatory strength of the physical variables
could be improved by additional physical data (e.g.,
light levels and currents), and by long-term measurements (e.g., waves were poorly estimated due to their
high temporal variability). None were available due to
the large-scale nature of the study. However, the finding
of similar explanatory strength by the two groups of
spatial and physical variables does suggest that the observed physical variables are possibly major determinants of soft coral abundances and that, in the absence
of observations on the physical data, the more easily
available spatial variables could be used as surrogates.

Notes: The fixed effects are shelf position, location of site, and depth; and reefs were treated
as random effects. The sums of squares are sequential. The total treatment degrees of freedom
are 46 (i.e., the number of non-empty cells minus 1).

We have noted that only visibility and shelf position
were strong surrogates for each other, and that for many
splits of the three physical-spatial trees, there were no
strong surrogates or alternative splits. Coupled with the
strong explanations given by the physical and spatial
models separately, this suggests that, for other than
visibility and shelf position, the splits determined by
spatial factors are equivalent to complex combinations
of physical factors, and vice versa.
COMPARISON OF TREES AND LINEAR MODELS

Example one: mixed effects analyses of variance
In this example we use A. laurae to show how regression trees can be used to interpret complex analysis
of variance tables. Analysis of variance is widely used
by ecologists, and, in the context of a well-designed
balanced study, is an effective method for determining
which factors affect a numeric response. However, as
the number of explanatory variables and the complexity
of the data increase (e.g., high-order interactions, lack
of balance, empty cells), then analysis of variance and
linear models become less effective. The inclusion of
random effects also greatly adds to the complexity of
the analysis, especially for unbalanced designs.
In the introductory example, we used a regression
tree to explain the abundance of A. laurae (Fig. 2a) in
terms of shelf position (inner, mid, outer), location
(front, back, channel, flank), depth (five levels) and
reefs (32 levels). The data were highly unbalanced
since channel locations only occur on inner reefs, flank
locations were underrepresented and inner reefs were
overrepresented (Table 2). Thus of the 60 possible cells
generated by the three fixed factors, only 47 occurred
in the data. In the mixed effects analysis of variance,
shelf, location, and depth were fixed effects, and reefs
nested in shelf were random effects and used as the
error term for shelf position. Sequential sums of
squares were used (Table 4). The analysis shows strong
effects of shelf, location, and shelf by location; a moderate interaction between shelf, location, and depth; and
strong variation between reefs (Table 4).
Interpretation of the analysis is difficult due to the
significant high-order interaction with many levels and

empty cells. Tabulations of means broken down by
shelf position, location, and depth, showed the strong
shelf and location effects, but failed to clearly identify
the three-way interaction. In comparison, the regression tree analysis led to a simple interpretation (Fig.
2a). The four-leaf tree explained 49.2% of the total ss
compared to 55.4% explained by the full tree, or equivalently, the analysis of variance with reef effects omitted. The three splits were (1) inner- and mid-shelf reefs
vs. outer-shelf reefs; (2) within outer-shelf reefs, flanks
and back vs. front (there are no channel sites on outershelf reefs); and (3) within front locations on outershelf reefs, shallow (<3 m) vs. moderate to deep (-3
m). Only the sites of split (3) had moderate or high
abundances, with the 37 deep sites having highest
abundances. The full tree (omitted) showed two strong
splits, one moderate split, and an additional 20 minor
splits. Each split represents a one-degree-of-freedom
contrast among the 47 cell means. The 24 leaves of the
full tree indicate there were only 24 unique cell means.
We assessed the information missed by the regression tree in two ways. First, we analyzed the residuals
from the tree using the same analysis of variance model
as for the full data set. Other than reef effects, no terms
were significant (P > 0.05). Second, we note the variation not explained by the four-leaf tree, but explained
by the full tree (or analysis of variance without reef
effects) was nonsignificant (F20326 = 1.07, P = 0.620).
Thus, we conclude the three one-degree-of-freedom
contrasts of the tree adequately explained all fixed effects of the analysis of variance.
By comparison with the analysis of variance, the
regression tree was far simpler. The splits of the tree
represent an optimum set of one-degree-of-freedom
contrasts, as defined by the splitting process. The advantages of the tree analysis, in its simplicity and ease
of interpretation are clear; advantages that increase as
the number of explanatory variables and complexity
increase.

linear models is difficult. We needed to include highorder interactions in our models, and account for the
hierarchy of interactions. Models were constructed by
forward inclusion, using P < 0.01 to be conservative.
An interaction was considered for inclusion only when
all lower order terms contained by it had been included
in the model. Forward inclusion based on Mallow's Cp
(Venables and Ripley 1999) was also used (results not
shown) and gave the same final model for Efflatounaria, but slightly more complex models for Sinularia
spp. and S. flexibilis. The effects of reef, which should
be treated as random, were not included due to the
complexity of determining appropriate error terms.
For Efflatounaria the final model (Model 1) comprised two factors, cross-shelf position and depth,
crossed with the numeric variable reef slope, which
resulted in 15 intercept and 14 slope parameters (one
slope parameter was not estimable because one cell had
constant reef slopes). Examination of parameter estimates failed to reveal patterns. One solution to the
problem of interpretation was to group reef slope into
two categories, reduce the number of categories for
depth, and then cross tabulate the mean abundance by
these reduced factors (Model 2 of Table 5, Table 6).
The regression tree (Fig. 5c) was used to choose the
split points:

-35? for slope and -3 m for depth. This

reduction was effective, and showed a similar pattern
to the regression tree with high abundance in medium
to deep sites (?3 m) in outer reefs, particularly on flat

sites

(<35?

slope).

Comparing

the reduced

model

(Model 2) against the full model (Model 1), showed
that the simplification resulted in the loss of significant
information (F17,344 = 2.23, P = 0.003, Table 5). Model
2, with 11 degrees of freedom (df), explained 68.2%
of the total ss, almost identical to 67.7% for the tree
with only five leaves (equivalent to 4 df). Fitting an
eight-leaf tree, for which there is support under crossvalidation (Fig. 5a), accounted for the depth effect
within mid-shelf reefs (Table 6), and slope effects within mid-shelf reefs in the deep and outer-shelf reefs in
the shallow (not shown). This tree accounted for 71.1%
of the total ss compared to 72.6% for the full model,
the difference

being nonsignificant

(F21,344

=

0.950, P

- 0.473).
For Sinularia spp. and S. flexibilis the final linear
models were extremely complex, and due to that complexity, uninterpretable. The model for Sinularia spp.
involved six of the eight environmental variables, and
five first-order interactions, and for S. fiexibilis five of
the eight environmental variables, and five first-order
and one second-order interaction.
These analyses highlight some difficulties in using
iterative selection (forward, backward, and stepwise
methods) of linear models for complex data. The resulting models will often include many interactions between quantitative and categorical variables, which
make interpretation difficult. Regression trees can help
in the selection of a simpler regression model as was
case with Efflatounaria. Given the problem of liberal
inclusion of variables, when using iterative selection
based on hypothesis tests (Draper 1995), and the demonstrated performance of regression trees, we suggest

the latter will often identify descriptive models for
complex ecological data more effectively than linear
regression models.
DISCUSSION

AND CONCLUSIONS

We have outlined the fundamentals of classification
and regression trees, and have shown how they can
model complex ecological data. Trees were used to
determine the environmental characteristics associated
with high abundances of three taxa. The analyses indicated that, for these taxa, the ability to establish dense
aggregations and monopolize space was restricted to
clearly defined types of reef habitat.
Effiatounaria occurred mainly in deep clear water
sites on the outer-shelf. These sites are also low in
sediment, and have the lowest wave action of the outershelf. Sinularia spp. occupies mainly shallow innershelf habitats of relatively high visibility, low wave
action, and high sediment levels. Sinularia flexibilis
occurs on channel sites that have the highest visibility
of the inner-shelf, are shallow, and have low wave action and moderate sediment levels. These findings are
consistent with previous studies that indicate that nutrition plays an important role in determining abundances of soft corals.
The photosynthetic efficiency in zooxanthellate soft
corals is generally low (Fabricius and Klumpp 1995).
This has two important consequences for the distribution of soft coral taxa. Firstly, light levels are only
high enough to saturate photosynthesis either in clear
water, or at shallow depth in turbid water. Secondly,
additional heterotrophic food intake is essential for
supplementing the phototrophic carbon supply, and for
providing nutrients. The two main food sources for soft
corals are suspended particulate matter and dissolved
nutrients. Members of the families Alcyoniidae (which
includes Sinularia) and Nephtheidae are efficient suspension feeders that feed on small suspended particulate matter (Fabricius et al. 1995a, b, Fabricius and
Domisse 2000). The highest concentrations of suspended particulate matter are found on the inner-shelf,
due to import by rivers and resuspension from the shallow sea floor (Revelante and Gilmartin 1982). In contrast, members of the family Xeniidae (which includes
Efflatounaria) efficiently take in dissolved nutrients
(Schlichter 1982), concentrations of which can be high
on the outer-shelf due to periodic upwelling of nutrientenriched deep water bodies (Wolanski 1994). The habitats of Sinularia are thus rich in suspended particulate
matter for suspension feeding, but also moderately
good for photosynthesis due to their shallow depth.
Conversely, habitats of Efflatounaria are rich in dissolved nutrients, good for photosynthesis due to the
clear water of the outer-shelf, and protected from extreme wave action of the outer-shelf by being deep
sites.
Surveys can, of course, only indicate relationships,
not causality, and follow-up experiments have been

3191

established to determine reasons for the observed distributions of these three taxa, and their ability to establish dense aggregations.
Classification and regression trees are powerful tools
for analysis of complex ecological data. Their features
include: (1) the ability to use different types of response
variables; (2) the capacity for interactive exploration,
description, and prediction; (3) invariance to transformations of explanatory variables; (4) easy graphical
interpretation of complex results involving interactions; (5) model selection by cross-validation; and (6)
procedures for handling missing values. In summary,
classification and regression trees are a valuable addition to the statistical toolbox of every ecologist and
environmental scientist.
SOFTWARE

Classification and regression trees are now available
in some statistical packages. Three sources, which we
have used, are listed here.
1. CART (1998) is specialized classification and regression tree software, and includes many advanced
features of tree construction. It is powerful and easy
to use.
2. S-Plus (Statistical Sciences 1999) is a high-level
statistical programming language, which includes
many tree routines. Though more difficult to use than
CART, it has greater flexibility and enables users to
develop their own applications.
3. SYSTAT (SPSS Inc. 1997) includes classification
and regression tree routines and, though they are quite
limited, they can serve as a useful introduction to the
topic.
Other tree software is available but has not been
examined by the authors.
