(Received December 1988; in revised form July 1989)
The descriptive data on venture investments collected by MacMillan et aL is analyzed here with
noncompensatury conjunctive and disjunctive models plus the familiar compensatory linear model. The
results show that risk handling ability and attention to detail are pre-eminent precursors of venture
performance. On the other hand, product and market variables appear to have diminished effectiveness
when all the diverse venture data are pooled and considered together, us distinct from when the ventures
are clustered into separate familial groups.

Key words--entrepreneurship,

venture capital, venture screening, behavioral decision models

INTRODUCTION
THREE

RECENT

PAPERS

have

examined

attributes for assessing venture capital
investments: MacMillan et al. [5] used a
questionnaire that described the characteristics
of venture capital investments in detail. On the
other hand, Khan [2, 3] developed an
instrument based on decision variables elicited
from venture capitalists, who then described
ventures in terms of these variables in the data
collected. Representing the decision-making
behavior of venture capitalists, this data was
modeled by Khan using compensatory and noncompensatory models.
The work presented here is a follow-up, in
that the MacMillan et al. data, based on an
instrument developed by researchers rather than
subjects, are analyzed in a similar manner. This

paper thereby tests the proposition that there
are salient characteristics inherent in descriptive
data for venture capital investments that can be
captured by these models. Furthermore, it examines volume and cost performance measures
in addition to the usual profit oriented criteria.
DATA

As described in the previous study [5], the
data is based on a survey of US venture capitalists. The questionnaire (appended in [5] and also
available from the authors) requires ratings of
four groups of venture attributes: (1) characteristics of the venture team; (2) characteristics of
the proposed product or service; (3) characteristics of the target market; (4) financial considerations. Additionally, venture performance is
compared against expectations over the time

<-----Page 1----->Khan et al.--Analy:ing the Characteristics of Entrepreneurial Ventures

period of the investment and rated for sales,
market share, costs, profits and ROI. The attributes are either indicator variables or measured on a 1-5 scale; the performance variables
are scaled 1-7.
The venture capitalists were selected from the
directories of the National Venture Capital Association, Venture Magazine and Silver's 1984
Who's Who in Venture Capital (Wiley, New
York). A mailing of 220 resulted in 67 responses, which provided information on 150
ventures. These covered a broad spectrum of
industry ranging from microelectronics through
genetics to speciality retailing and publishing.
Given the heterogeneous nature of venture
capital investments, however, this would not
have been unexpected.
MODELS
Conjunctive and disjunctive models are the
two noncompensatory types applied (for a detailed exposition, see [3]). The conjunctive
model implies a minimum evaluation function,
so that an acceptable alternative has to satisfy
certain minimums over all the attributes considered. The disjunctive model is successful where
extraordinary performance on any one attribute, as measured against a maximum evaluation function, is required.
The linear compensatory model is well
known. A basic assumption, however, concerns
the normality of error terms. As the data questionnaire required venture capitalists to describe
a most successful and a least successful venture,
the bi-modal nature of the responses would be
likely to violate this assumption. Blurring the
bi-modality though, were high variances for the
dependent performance variable data [5, p. 126].
And even in the extreme case of a binary or
indicator dependent variable,
"'the method of least squares still provides unbiased
estimates, which, under quite general conditions, are
asymptotically normal. Hence, when the sample size
is large, inferences concerning the regression
coefficients and mean responses can be m a d e in the
same fashion as when the error terms are assumed to
be normally distributed" [6, p. 232].

measures. It is therefore interesting to study this
data for confirmatory evidence and salient
venture attributes.
RESULTS
Some of the 150 responses had missing values
(particularly on performance measures) and not
all questions applied to every venture, so that
the actual size of the data set varied from n = 98
to n = l l3 (Table 1).
Models were derived using the SAS stepwise
regression procedures, forward and backward,
and the 'best' models selected on the basis of the
usual criteria of fit, number of variables, significance, etc.
The performance measures for the ventures in
the data set included two volume sensitive measures-sales and market share, and two income
oriented ones--absolute profits and ROI. Three
basic cost measures were also used: these were
marketing costs, production costs, and start-up
and development costs labeled general and administrative. These seven performance measures
served as the dependent variables.
The coefficient of determination (R:) values
for all the models generated are given in Table
1. In general, the conjunctive model type provides a better or almost as good a fit as the linear
model but with fewer variables. The disjunctive
model does not perform as well as either of the
others. Since the disjunctive model is designed
to favor single attribute specialization, it is a
safe conjecture that venture screening demands
attention to multiple attributes.
The profit measure models in all cases indicate the best fit, next are revenue and lastly cost.
The finding is surprising because profits are
subject to the variability of both revenues and
costs. One possible explanation is that profits
serve as the focus of thought processes in the
selection of variables and in completing questionnaires. The result is that more of these

variables are relatively more significant when
the dependent variable is a profit measure.
The linear model has performed well. This is
not unusual, and it has often been successful in
an uncertain decision environment [4]. However, it would be difficult to imagine a decisionmaker employing it as a cognitive process--in
other words doing a mental computation of the
coefficients and the dependent variable as a
prelude to his decision! Its success has been
attributed, instead, to characteristics of the
model itself [1, 7]; the only precondition is that
the relationship modeled is conditionally
monotone.
The conjunctive model, on the other hand,
offers the possibility of providing a quick cognitive filter once the minimum evaluation function
is established. Furthermore, it offers the paten-

tial of improving the intuitive judgement of the
venture capitalist with repeated use.

two successful model types (conjunctive and
linear) are depicted in Tables 2 and 3. Each table

Characteristics o f venture team

The ability to evaluate and react well to risk
is highly significant for both volume related
(sales and market share) and profit related
(profits and ROI) measures but not for costs.
Since revenues and profits are influenced by
external factors to a greater degree than costs,
the unexpected or unforeseen (requiring riskhandling ability) is more likely. To the extent
that a suitable response to the unexpected is

likely to require creativity on the part of the
venture team the results concur with Khan's
[2, 3] findings that when actual venture outcomes are modeled, creativity and ingenuity are
highly significant harbingers of success.
Cost control can be expected to require careful attention to detail. So it is not surprising that
attention to detail is highly significant for all
three cost measures. Its significance also carries
through to the profit-related measures. The
distinction between the performance measures
(revenue-related) that respond to risk-handling
and those (cost-related) that respond to attention to detail, so clearly evident in the conjunctive model (Table 2), is slightly blurred in the
linear model (Table 3), which is compensatory.
Again, as might be expected, familiarity with
the target market is significant for the two
volume oriented measures, sales and market

share. Knowledge of the target market should
result in more accurate and realistic expectations of these criteria. The effect is also reflected
in the models predicting profits and ROI.
The track record relevant to the venture
reflects experience and the effect of this experience appears to result in a careful watch on
costs. The variable is significant for all three cost
measures in both the conjunctive and linear
models. The fact that it does not carry through
to the profit and ROI models seems to imply
that the vagaries (risks) of the marketplace
swamp the benefits of past experience.
Two other venture team variables play a
minor role in the conjunctive model. These are
familiarity with the venture team's reputation
and referral from a trustworthy source. Both
variables are somewhat more effective in the
linear model.

<-----Page 4----->Omega. Vol. 18, No. 1

Characteristics o f product

The next group of venture characteristics deal
with the product or service provided. In the
conjunctive model, they are not significant over
most of the performance measures. Where they
do appear, their coefficients are an order of
magnitude smaller and also negative. And even
in the linear model demonstrated market
acceptance is the only product variable that
indicates some consistency--it is significant for
both revenue measures. The generally weak
performance of the product variables here when
all the ventures are pooled together, is in sharp
contrast to their usefulness when the ventures
had been clustered into several distinct groups
(see Macmillan et al., pp. 128-129). Therefore
any future effort that applies conjunctive and
linear models to each of the separate clusters
would be most interesting.
M a r k e t and financial

A m o n g the market characteristics, both access to distribution channel and high growth
target market have significant coefficients for
more than one performance measure in both
models.
Finally, the dominant financial considerations are a I0 times return within five years and
no subsequent investment in the venture. The
former is a posteriori and could be self-fulfilling
because by the time a respondent has responded, successful investments are likely to
have met the criterion and unsuccessful not.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper has tested successfully the proposition that there are salient characteristics inherent in descriptive data for venture capital
investments, and that these can be captured by
noncompensatory behavioral decision models.
The results show that of the two model t y p e s - conjunctive and disjunctive--the conjunctive
model performs best. Also successful is the
linear compensatory model.
A m o n g ~'enture team characteristics a clear
and unambiguous finding relates to their "riskhandling" and "attention to detail" attributes.

5

Risk-handling is highly significant for volume
and profit performance measures. And to the
extent that it involves reponding to the unexpected, it also reflects the venture team's creativity and ingenuity which, on their own, have been
determined highly significant in earlier work
[2, 3]. The other venture team characteristic of
major significance, attention to detail, is found
to be relevant for profit, but is particularly
significant across all cost measures. Of the
remaining team attributes, familiarity with the
market is significant for both volume and profit,
and relevant track record affects all cost
measures.
The significance of product rariables, and to a
lesser extent market variables, appears to have
been attenuated by the diversity of ventures. It
can be argued, therefore, that the results of this
analysis, and others like it, where all ventures
are pooled together, tends to emphasize characteristics that are likely to be consistent for
diverse ventures, namely, the attributes of a
good venture team. This accounts for the
divergence between the results obtained here
with respect to product and market variables
and those indicated earlier [5] where some of
these variables were key for certain clusters of
ventures.
