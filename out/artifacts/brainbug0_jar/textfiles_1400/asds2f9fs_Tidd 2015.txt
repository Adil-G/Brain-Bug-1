<-----Page 0----->Identifying Innovative Capabilities
Joe Tidd 1
Introduction
The resource-based view is concerned essentially with identifying and building on strengths,
preferably those which, for whatever reason, are unique to the firm. Every firm is unique by
virtue of its history, value chain configuration, organization culture etc. The challenge is to make
the firm’s uniqueness the source of its sustainable competitive advantage.
At one level the identification of competence appears to pose few difficulties. There are many
cases which refer, for example, to the core competence of Honda in engines or Sony in
minituarisation and which explore why and how these firms have developed and maintain these
competencies. But for core competence to be a tool of strategic analysis what is also required is a
means for firms to analyse rigorously, their own and their competitors' competencies. Yet,
despite all the effort and attention, Coyne, Hall and Clifford (1997) writing in The McKinsey
Quarterly in early 1997, noted how elusive core competencies remain, ‘Few managers we have
talked to could claim to have utilised core competence to achieve success in the marketplace,
and even fewer to have built a core competence from scratch. Indeed, most were uncertain as to
exactly what qualifies a core competence ... it is like a mirage: something that from a distance
appears to offer hope..but turns to sand when approached’ (p.41). Our own experience in
working with the concept of core competence supports their view. Competencies disappear all to
easily under close examination. A careful scrutiny of competence claims reveals, all too often,
that they are neither firm specific nor sustainable, that they convey neither functionality to the
customer nor generic qualities to the firm.
This exercise uses a technique for analysing intangible resources which is based on the
identification and development of the strengths in the key product/delivery system attributes
and the intangible resources which produce them. The exercise consists of three parts:
1. Identifying the key attributes of the most successful products and services offered by the
organization;
2. Mapping these attributes to the resources or competencies of the organization, including
tangible and intangible resources;
3. Assessing the potential for sustaining, protecting and exploiting these resources, including
knowledge management.

<-----Page 1----->1. Identifying key attributes
A pragmatic view on the nature of competitive advantage was advanced by Coyne (1986) whose
argument starts with the observation that any company which is making repeat sales in a
competitive market must enjoy an advantage in the eyes of the customers who are making the
repeat purchases. He went on to argue that for a sustainable competitive advantage to exist
three conditions must apply:
• Customers must perceive a consistent difference in important attributes between the
producer’s product/service and the attributes offered by competitors.
• This difference is the direct consequence of a capability gap between the producer and its
competitors.
• Both the difference in important attributes and the capability gap can be expected to endure
over time.
Coyne suggests that there are four, and only four, types of resource capability:
• Regulatory: the possession of legal entities, e.g. patents & trademarks.
• Positional: the results of previous endeavour, e.g. reputation, trust, value chain
configuration.
• Business systems: the ability to do things well, e.g. consistent conformance to
specification.
• Organizational characteristics, e.g. the ability to manage change.
It is now possible to ask the question ‘What is the nature of the package of product/delivery
system attributes which customers value?’ and to go on to ask the question, ‘What is responsible
for producing the valued attributes?’. The product/delivery system attributes will include factors
such as: price, quality, specification, image, etc.
The valued attributes

Table 1. Typical Product/Delivery System Attributes Which Define Competitive
Advantage
Image What is the image of the product range? Is it important?
Price Is a low selling price a key buying criterion?
User friendliness Is it important for the product to be user friendly?
Availability Is product range availability crucial?
Rapid response to enquiry Is it important to produce designs, quotations, etc. very quickly?
Quick response to customer demand Will sales be lost to the competition if they respond
more quickly than you?
Width of product range Is it important to offer a wide range of products and/or services to
customers?

<-----Page 2----->New product to market time How important is the product development time?
Quality - the product's fitness for purpose Does the product or service deliver exactly the
benefits which the customers want?
Quality - the consistent achievement of defined specification Is constant conformance
to spec. vital?
Safety Is safety in use a major concern?
Regulatory requirements Does meeting regulatory requirements earlier/better than the
competition give a competitive advantage?
Degree of innovation Is it important for the product or service to represent ‘state of the art’?
Ability to vary product specification Is it important to produce product or service
modifications easily and quickly?
Ability to vary product volume Is it important to be able to increase, or decrease,
production volume easily?
Customer service Is the quality of the overall service which customers receive a key to
winning business?
Pre and after sales service Is the supply of advice, spares, etc. a key aspect of winning
business?
It may be necessary to identify different rankings for different categories of customers, e.g. new
as opposed to long-standing customers, retailers as opposed to end users, etc. In carrying out
this analysis of attributes it is appropriate to seek consensus between the relevant executives
with respect to questions such as:
• Can executives agree an importance weighting for each attribute?
• Can executives agree a benchmark score for each attribute compared with the competition?
• Can executives agree the sustainability of the advantage represented by each attribute?
The degree of congruence, or dissonance, in executives’ perceptions of these issues can in itself
be illuminating. In addition to identifying the current strengths in the marketplace, it is also
appropriate at this stage to identify known deficiencies in the product offering.

2. Mapping attributes to resources & competencies
The important characteristics of strategic competencies are:
• They are responsible for delivering a significant benefit to customers.
• They are idiosyncratic to the firm.
• They take time to acquire.
• They are sustainable because they are difficult and time-consuming to imitate.
• They comprise configurations of resources.
• They have a strong tacit content and are socially complex – they are the product of
experiential learning.

<-----Page 3----->The resources which produce product/delivery system attributes can now be placed in a
framework of capabilities:
Regulatory capability – resources which are legal entities.
• Tangible, on balance sheet, assets.
• Intangible, off balance sheet, assets, e.g. Patents
Licences
Trademarks
Contracts
Protectable data, etc.
Positional capability – resources which are not legal entities and which are the result of
previous endeavour, i.e. with a high path dependency:
• Reputation of company.
• Reputation of product.
• Corporate networks.
• Personal networks.
• Unprotectable data.
• Distribution network.
• Supply chain network.
• Formal and informal operating systems.
• Processes.
Functional capability – resources which are either individual skills and know-how or team
skills and know-how, within the company, at suppliers, or at distributors etc.
• Employee know-how & skills in:
o

Operations

o

Finance

o

Marketing

o

R&D, ec.

• Supplier know-how.
• Distributor know-how.
• Professional advisors expertise, etc.
Cultural capability – resources which are the characteristics of the organization:
• Perception of quality standards.

<-----Page 4----->• Tradition of customer service.
• Ability to manage change.
• Ability to innovate.
• Team working ability.
• Ability to develop staff, suppliers and distributors.
• Automatic response mechanisms.
Whilst it is possible for a valued product/delivery system attribute to be the result of a tangible
asset such as a building or a specialist manufacturing capability, research and experience
suggest intangible resources such as: product reputation, employee know-ow, etc. are the factors
most often responsible for producing the attributes which are valued by customers. The
identification of the intangibles which are responsible for each key product attribute results in a
summary such as that shown in Table 2.

Summary of the
key resources
The resources which occur frequently in the body of the matrix are those which, either by
themselves, or in combination with others, constitute the organization’s strategic competencies.

<-----Page 5----->3. Sustaining, protecting & exploiting competencies
Having identified the key resources it is appropriate to examine development scenarios in terms
of protection, sustenance, enhancement, and leverage.
Table 3. Issues with Respect to the Development of Intangible Resources
With respect to protection
• Do all concerned recognize the value of this intangible resource to the company?
• Can the resource be protected in law?
With respect to sustainability
• How long did it take to acquire this resource? Is it unique because of all that has happened in
creating it?
• How durable is the resource? Will it decline with time?
• How easily may the resource be lost?
• How easily and quickly can others identify and imitate the resource?
• Can others easily ‘buy’ the resource?
• Can others easily ‘grow’ the resource?
• How appropriable is the resource? Can it ‘walk away’?
• Is the resource vulnerable to substitution?
With respect to enhancement
• Is the ‘stock’ of this resource increasing?
• How can we ensure that the ‘stock’ of this resource continues to increase?
With respect to exploitation
• Are we making the best use of this resource?
• How else could it be used?
• Is the scope for synergy identified and exploited?
• Are we aware of the key linkages which exist between the resources?

<-----Page 6----->This approach to the analysis of intangible resources is the acquisition of a new perspective and
language which enable them to codify the tacit knowledge which they have of their companies.
In particular executives have welcomed the, sometimes new, emphasis placed on issues such as:
• How can the key resource of reputation be protected, enhanced and leveraged?
• How can management ensure that every employee is disposed to be both a promoter and
custodian of the reputation which employs him/her?
• What are the key areas of employee know-how? Can they be codified? How long do they take
to acquire?
• Is the business organized so that working and learning are the same?
C-space (culture space) is a useful conceptual framework for this analysis. It focuses on the
structuring and flow of knowledge within and between organizations. It consists of two
dimensions: codification and diffusion (Figure 1). Codifying knowledge involves taking
information that human agents carry in their heads and find hard to articulate, and structuring
it in such a way that its complexity is reduced. This enables it to be incorporated into physical
objects or described on paper. Once this has occurred, it will develop a life of its own and can
diffuse quite rapidly and extensively. Knowledge moves around the C-space in a cyclical fashion
as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: The C-Space

This can help define what an organization needs to do over time to maintain and renew
resources and competencies. Effective management is about knowing where to locate knowledge
resources and the organizational linkages that integrate them together to create competencies.
Managing this process is a purposive activity. It requires resources.

<-----Page 7----->The objectives of the framework are:
1. to enable an organization to map its resources and the key linkages between them onto the
C-space;
2. to act as an elicitation device to facilitate a discussion about the meaning and action required
– in terms of core competencies and knowledge resources.
First, position each of the competencies identified in Stage 2 onto the C-space by placing each of
them at a point on the codification and diffusion scales. The relevant population for diffusion
needs to be defined: rather different data are generated when the diffusion population is the
firm as opposed to the industry, for example. For discussions about competence it is often
helpful to explore how widely knowledge about technologies and linkages are shared within the
firm and within the industry. Comparing firm and industry level diffusion patterns can help
firms to recognize that, while a particular technology may not be widely diffused within the firm,
it is widely diffused among other firms in the industry. In this way, participants avoid the trap of
believing that because something is new to them it is also new to their competitors.
An example of a codification scale is as follows:
Codified
Can be totally automated
Can be partially automated
Can be systematically described
Can be described and put down on paper
Can be shown and described verbally
Can be shown
Inside someone’s heard
Uncodified
An example of a diffusion scale to be used at the industry level is:
Diffused
Known by all firms in all industries
Known by many firms in all industries
Known by many firms in many industries
Known by many firms in a few industries
Known by a handful of firms in a few industries
Known by only a handful of firms in one industry
Known only by one firm in one industry
Undiffused
Such scales may appear rather inexact but, for this purpose, they are exact enough. The C-space
is an heuristic not an indicator or a measurement device.
We can use these ‘maps’ of competencies to help to identify the management action needed.
