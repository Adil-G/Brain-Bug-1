rospect theory is currently the main descriptive theory of decision under uncertainty. It generalizes expected
utility by introducing nonlinear decision weighting and loss aversion. A difﬁculty in the study of multiattribute utility under prospect theory is to determine when an attribute yields a gain or a loss. One possibility,
adopted in the theoretical literature on multiattribute utility under prospect theory, is to assume that a decision
maker determines whether the complete outcome is a gain or a loss. In this holistic evaluation, decision weighting
and loss aversion are general and attribute-independent. Another possibility, more common in the empirical
literature, is to assume that a decision maker has a reference point for each attribute. We give preference foundations for this attribute-speciﬁc evaluation where decision weighting and loss aversion are depending on the
attributes.

Introduction

In this paper, we study multiattribute utility theory
under prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979,
Tversky and Kahneman 1992). Prospect theory is currently the most inﬂuential theory of decision making under uncertainty. It models two major deviations
from expected utility: nonlinear decision weighting
and loss aversion, i.e., the tendency that people treat
outcomes as deviations from a reference point and
are more sensitive to losses than to gains of the same
magnitude. Both nonlinear decision weighting and
loss aversion are widely documented in the empirical
literature. Despite its popularity, some evidence has
been accumulated recently revealing limitations of the
theory (see the summaries of Marley and Luce 2005
and Birnbaum 2008).
Fishburn (1984), Miyamoto (1988), Dyckerhoff
(1994), and Miyamoto and Wakker (1996) also studied multiattribute utility under nonexpected utility,
but only considered outcomes of the same sign. Like
us, Zank (2001) and Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003)
studied multiattribute utility theory under prospect
theory but their approach was different than the
approach of this paper, as we explain next.
A central issue in multiattribute prospect theory
is to determine when an attribute yields a gain or
a loss. Consider, for example, a research associate

Many decision situations involve outcomes that consist of several attributes. In applied decision analyses, it is useful to decompose the utility function
over these multiattribute outcomes into separate utility functions over the different attributes to reduce the
number of preference elicitations. This is only justiﬁed if the decision-maker’s preferences satisfy particular assumptions. Several authors have identiﬁed the
preference conditions that allow decomposing multiattribute utility functions into additive, multiplicative, and related decompositions (e.g., Farquhar 1975,
Fishburn 1965, Keeney and Raiffa 1976).
Most of these decomposition results have been
derived under expected utility. Abundant evidence
exists, however, that (subjective) expected utility is
not valid as a descriptive theory of decision under
(uncertainty) risk. The descriptive deﬁciencies of
expected utility complicate the empirical assessment
of the preference conditions underlying decompositions: it cannot be excluded that observed violations of preference conditions are due to violations of
expected utility rather than to violations of a decomposition. To obtain robust tests of the appropriateness
of decompositions, it is desirable to derive conditions
that are valid even when expected utility is violated.

(RA) who contemplates changing jobs. In evaluating different jobs, the RA has to consider several
aspects, e.g., salary, commuting time, cost of living, amount of research time, etc. How does the
RA determine whether a particular job offer is an
improvement (a gain) compared with her reference
point (presumably her current job)? One possibility is
that she ﬁrst determines whether the job offer, as a
whole, is a gain or a loss compared to her reference
point, and then applies the decomposition to determine how attractive the job offer is compared with
other offers. This holistic evaluation was used by Zank
(2001) and by Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003).
Another approach, the focus of this paper, is that
the RA determines a reference point for each attribute
and evaluates job offers as gains and losses on each
attribute. This attribute-speciﬁc evaluation seems plausible when the number of attributes is large and
the choice is complex. A decision context where the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is particularly intuitive is
welfare theory: there we are interested in whether
each individual’s welfare is above some reference
level. The attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is commonly
assumed in empirical studies on loss aversion for
trade-offs under certainty and was found to be
descriptively accurate by some studies (Bateman
et al. 1997, Bleichrodt and Pinto 2002, Tversky and
Kahneman 1991). Also empirical studies for decision
under risk relied on the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation.
See, for example, Payne et al. (1984) who study managers’ choices among capital budget proposals involving cash ﬂows at two points in time, and Fischer
et al. (1986) who consider both risky, multiperiod
cash ﬂows and risky job alternatives. Both studies
use attribute-speciﬁc reference points. No preference
foundation of the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation existed
until now. Providing such a foundation is the topic of
this paper.
The difference between the holistic and the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is that in the former, loss
aversion and decision weighting are attribute-independent, whereas in the latter they depend on the
attributes. As we show in §5, the holistic and the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation are in general equivalent
only when people behave according to expected utility, i.e., when loss aversion does not affect people’s
preferences and there is no decision weighting. An
example to further clarify the difference between the
holistic and the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is in §3.
This paper gives preference foundations for additive utility under prospect theory and the attributespeciﬁc evaluation. We restrict our attention to the
additive decomposition for two reasons: First, it is
commonly applied in many areas of economics and
decision analysis. Second, other decompositions, such

as multiplicative and multilinear utility, raise special problems under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation.
Solving these problems is beyond the scope of this
paper.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 gives notation and explains prospect theory for single-attribute outcomes. In §3, we move to
multiattribute utility where we ﬁrst assume, for ease
of exposition, that there are just two attributes, both
numerical. Section 4 gives preference foundations
for prospect theory with additive utility under the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation. As mentioned, weighting functions are deﬁned per attribute and they may
differ across attributes in the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation. To force them to be equal across attributes
requires additional conditions. We will characterize
this special case in §5. We extend our results to the
case where there are more than two attributes in §6
and to the case of nonnumeric outcomes in §7. Section 8 concludes the paper with some observations
on the empirical measurement of additive utility in
prospect theory under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation. All proofs are in the appendix.

Prospect Theory for
Single-Attribute Outcomes

We consider a decision maker in a situation where
there is a ﬁnite number, n ≥ 2 of distinct states of
nature, exactly one of which obtains. S = 1     n
denotes the ﬁnite set of states of nature. Subsets of S are
called events. In a medical decision problem, the states
of nature can, for example, be mutually exclusive diseases, and the decision maker has to choose between
different treatments before knowing what the actual
disease is. We consider decision under uncertainty
where the probabilities for the states of nature may,
but need not, be given. The assumption of a ﬁnite
number of states of nature is made for expositional
purposes. The results of this paper can be extended
to an inﬁnite state space using tools from Wakker
(1993). The extension to decision under risk, i.e., the
case where probabilities are objectively given, is as in
Köbberling and Wakker (2003, §5.3).
The decision-maker’s problem is to choose between
prospects. Each prospect is an n-tuple of outcomes, one
for each state of nature. Formally, a prospect is a function from the set of states of nature to the set of outcomes C. We denote the set of prospects as P = C n .
We shall write f1      fn  for the prospect f that
gives fj if state j occurs. A constant prospect gives
the same outcome for each state of nature. For ease
of exposition, we assume in this section that outcomes are one-dimensional. The set of outcomes C is
a nondegenerate convex subset of . Outcomes are
deﬁned with respect to a reference point. The reference

point is a constant prospect, that we will denote as r.
We assume that the reference point is ﬁxed, i.e., we
restrict attention to preferences with respect to one
reference point. Variations in the reference point are
analyzed by Schmidt (2003).
Let  denote a preference relation on the set of
prospects. As usual,  denotes the asymmetric part
of  (strict preference) and ∼ denotes the symmetric
part of  (indifference), and  and ≺ denote reversed
preferences. We shall use the same notation for the
binary relations on C, derived through constant prospects. An outcome x  r is a gain and an outcome
x ≺ r is a loss.
A prospect f is rank-ordered if f1  · · ·  fn . For
each prospect, there exists a permutation , such that
f1  · · ·  fn . For each permutation , let P =
f ∈ P 	 f1  · · ·  fn . That is, P is the set of all
prospects that are rank-ordered by . If two prospects
can be rank-ordered by a common , then they are
comonotonic. For each event A ⊂ S, the set P A contains
those prospects that yield gains for states in A, and no
gains for states not in A. We deﬁne the set PA as the
intersection of P A and P . Subsets of sets PA are signcomonotonic.
A real-valued function V 	 P →  represents  on
P if for all f , g ∈ P we have f  g if and only if
(iff) V f  ≥ V g. A function V is a ratio scale if it
is unique up to unit, i.e., if V can be replaced by
U if and only if U = 
V for positive 
. A weighting
function or capacity W is a function on 2S , such that
W 
 = 0, W S = 1, and for any two events A and B,
if B ⊂ A then W B ≤ W A. W is strictly increasing if
W B < W A whenever B is a proper subset of A.
Prospect theory holds if there exists a utility function
U 	 C →  with U r = 0 such that prospects f ∈ PA

From now on C = C1 × C2 is a product of two
nondegenerate convex subsets of . Hence we now
deal with two product structures: the two-dimensional
structure of C and the n-dimensional structure C n .
In what follows, the index i will refer to the attributes,
and the index j to the states of nature. Hence fji
denotes the ith attribute of the outcome that is
obtained under state j Outcomes in C will be denoted
as x = x1  x2  or as x1 x2 for short. Note that although
we assumed x1 and x2 to be numerical, the notation
x1 x2 should not be interpreted as multiplication.
Let P1 denote the set of prospects on C1n and P2 the
set of prospects on C2n  For a ﬁxed f2 ∈ P2 , we deﬁne a
preference relation 1 on P1 by f1 1 g1 iff f1 f2  g1 f2 .
In §4 we impose a condition that implies that the
choice of f2 is immaterial. By restricting attention to
constant prospects in P1 , we can deﬁne a preference
relation 1 on C1  In a similar fashion we can deﬁne
2 on P2 and on C2 .
A function U 	 C →  is additive if U 	 x → U1 x1  +
U2 x2  where Ui is a real-valued function on Ci ,
i = 1 2. The functions U1 and U2 are joint ratio scales if
U1 and U2 can be replaced by V1 and V2 if and only if
Vi = 
Ui , 
 > 0 That is, any common change in unit
is allowed.
In the holistic evaluation, any outcome x that is
indifferent to r can also be interpreted as a reference
point. Hence, it does not make sense to consider gains
or losses on any separate dimension in the holistic
evaluation. What matters in the holistic evaluation is
whether an outcome x is a gain or a loss compared
to r (i.e., whether x  r or x ≺ r, respectively).
Under the holistic evaluation, additive decomposability means that a prospect f ∈ PA with A =

and choices and preferences correspond with this evaluation. PTf  denotes the prospect theory value, or PT
value for short, of f , and W + and W − are weighting
functions for gains and losses, respectively. We will
assume throughout that U is strictly increasing, i.e., for
all x y ∈ C, U x ≥ U y iff x ≥ y, and continuous. If
prospect theory holds, then utility is a ratio scale and
the weighting functions are uniquely determined.

where the decision weights are deﬁned as in Equations (2a) and (2b). The uniqueness results of prospect
theory apply, which implies that the attribute utility functions are joint ratio scales and the weighting function is unique. There is only one permutation
function that applies to both attributes. In this representation, the decision weight that is assigned to a
single-attribute utility function Ui , i = 1 2 depends
on whether the entire outcome is a gain or a loss. If
an outcome x is a gain then the decision weight  +
is applied, if it is a loss then  − is applied. Preference foundations for Equation (3) were given by Zank
(2001) and Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003).

The attribute-speciﬁc evaluation assesses for each
attribute separately whether it yields a gain or a loss
and the magnitude of each. That is, the attributespeciﬁc evaluation interprets reference-dependence
for each attribute separately. We will denote the
reference point on the ﬁrst attribute by r1 and the reference point on the second attribute by r2 . x1 ∈ C1 is a gain
if x1 1 r1 , and a loss if x1 ≺1 r1 , and x2 ∈ C2 is a gain
if x2 2 r2 , and a loss if x2 ≺2 r2 . We assume that preferences are monotonic in each attribute. Then, unlike
in the holistic evaluation, the reference point will be
unique. We further assume that r1 is an interior point
of C1 and that r2 is an interior point of C2 . This ensures
that C1 and C2 both contain outcomes that are gains
and outcomes that are losses, and that genuine tradeoffs between gains and losses exist for both attributes.
For each prospect f , there exist permutations 1
and 2 such that f1 11  · · ·  f1 n1 and f2 12  · · · 
f2 n2 . Let P1 = f ∈ P 	 f1 11  · · ·  f1 n1 . That is,
P1 is the set of all prospects where outcomes are
rank-ordered by 1 . P2 is deﬁned similarly. For each
event A1 ⊂ S, the set P A1 contains those prospects
that yield gains on the ﬁrst attribute for states in A1
and no gains on the ﬁrst attribute for states not
in A1 . Similarly, P A2 contains those prospects that
yield gains on the second attribute for states in A2
and no gains on the second attribute for states not
in A2 . We deﬁne PA11 = P A1 ∩ P1 and PA22 = P A2 ∩
P2 . Subsets of PA11 are said to be sign-comonotonic on
C1 and subsets of PA22 are said to be sign-comonotonic
on C2 . Under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, a prospect
f ∈ PA11 ∩ PA22 with A1 = 1 1     1 k1  and A2 =

and preferences and choices correspond with this
evaluation. The functions U1 and U2 are strictly
increasing and continuous and satisfy U1 r1  =
U2 r2  = 0. The decision weights +1 ·1 and −1 ·1 are
the decision weights for gains and losses for the ﬁrst

attribute, +2 ·2 and −2 ·2 are the decision weights for
gains and losses for the second attribute, W1+ and W1−
are the weighting functions for gains and losses for
the ﬁrst attribute, and W2+ and W2− are the weighting
functions for gains and losses for the second attribute.
The utility functions are joint ratio scales and the
attribute weighting functions are unique. A comparison between Equations (3) and (4) reveals that the
holistic evaluation and the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation differ both in loss aversion and in decision
weighting.
An example may further clarify the difference
between the holistic and the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation of additive utility. Suppose that the RA considers a job offer from a university in a different
town. The uncertainty she faces is whether her husband will be able to ﬁnd a suitable job in the new
town. If he does, their combined annual income will
be $80K but she will only have 15 hours research
time per week because she will have to take over
some domestic activities from her husband (e.g., taking care of the children). If he does not ﬁnd a job,
their combined annual income will be $40K but she
will have 30 hours research time per week because
her husband will take care of all domestic activities.
In the example, there is only one source of uncertainty
(whether or not the RA’s husband ﬁnds a suitable
job). In real-life applications, there may be different
sources of uncertainty affecting the attributes separately. For example, the RA’s research time may not
be affected by her husband ﬁnding a job (because
she can hire someone to take care of her domestic
activities) but it is affected by whether or not she
will be able to ﬁnd a suitable home near the university (if not, commuting will negatively affect the time
available for research). To model such situations we
have to reﬁne the state space (events are “husband
ﬁnds job and home near the university,” “husband
ﬁnds job but home far from university,” etc.). For simplicity of exposition, we only consider one source of
uncertainty.
The RA’s preferences are monotonic both in money
(more money is preferred) and in research time (more
research time is preferred). Suppose that currently the
RA and her husband earn $50K per year and she has
20 hours research time per week. Suppose also that
$80K 15 h  $50K 20 h  $40K 30 h The RA’s
reference point is $50K 20 h in the holistic evaluation. In the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, the RA’s
reference point for annual income is $50K and for
research time it is 20 hours per week.
In the holistic evaluation, where we determine ﬁrst
the sign of an outcome and then apply the decompositions, we assume that the RA’s utility function
for gains is ux1 x2  − ur1 r2  and her utility function for losses is ux1 x2  − ur1 r2 , where  is a

<-----Page 4----->Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: Additive Utility in Prospect Theory

coefﬁcient reﬂecting loss aversion and u is a basic
utility function, expressing the RA’s attitude toward
outcomes, which is reference independent (Tversky
and Kahneman 1991, Köbberling and Wakker 2005).
We assume that the holistic basic utility is additive
such that ux1 x2  = u1 x1  + u2 x2 .
In the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, where ﬁrst the
decomposition is applied and then it is determined
whether attributes yield gains or losses, the utility for
gains is ui xi  − ui ri  and for losses it is i ui xi  −
ui ri ; i = 1 2, where the i are attribute-speciﬁc loss
aversion coefﬁcients.
The RA does not care about job aspects other than
wage rate and available research time. If event 1 is,
“her husband ﬁnds a job” and event 2 is, “her husband does not ﬁnd a job,” then, according to the holistic evaluation (Equation (3)), the PT value of the new
job is equal to

A comparison between Equations (6) and (7) shows
that both decision weighting and loss aversion differ
between the two evaluations. Loss aversion and decision weighting are common for all individual attributes
in the holistic evaluation; the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, in general, allows for different degrees of loss aversion and different weighting functions for each of the
individual attributes.
The possibility of attribute-dependent weighting
functions can be realistic in applications. Rottenstreich
and Hsee (2001) showed that decision weighting depends on the outcome domain with people deviating
more from expected utility for affect-rich outcomes,
outcomes that arouse strong emotions. Examples of
such outcomes are health states and environmental
effects. For example, Smith and Keeney (2005) studied trade-offs between consumption and health. In
such a setting it might well be that people weight
health risks differently than consumption risks. Dyer
et al. (1998) compared different alternatives for disposing surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Here decision makers may weight risks to the environment
differently from risk regarding the costs of the alternatives. In §5, we characterize the special case of
the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation where the weighting functions are the same across different attributes.
There is no empirical evidence to conclude that loss
aversion differs across different attributes, but intuitively this seems to make sense.

Preference Foundations

This section develops preference foundations for additive prospect theory under the attribute-speciﬁc
evaluation, i.e., Equation (4). We continue to assume
that C = C1 ×C2 with C1 and C2 nondegenerate convex
subsets of .
4.1. General Preference Conditions
This subsection presents the standard preference conditions that are used in both the holistic and attributespeciﬁc approaches. The preference relation  on the
set of prospects P is a weak order if it is complete (for
all prospects f  g f  g or g  f ) and transitive.
Any prospect f ∈ P yields both a prospect f1 ∈ P1
and a prospect f2 ∈ P2 and, hence, each prospect f
may be viewed as an element of the product P1 × P2 .
Hence, we can denote prospects as f1 f2 . Weak
separability holds when for all f1  g1 ∈ P1 and for all
f2  g2 ∈ P2  f1 f2  g1 f2 iff f1 g2  g1 g2 and when for
all f1  g1 ∈ P1 and for all f2  g2 ∈ P2  f1 f2  f1 g2 iff
g1 f2  g1 g2 . Weak separability entails that the relations
1 on P1 and 2 on P2 are well-deﬁned.
Further standard properties are monotonicity for
outcomes and continuity: outcome monotonicity holds if
for i = 1 2 fji ≥ gji for all j implies fi i gi with strict
preference holding if one of the antecedent inequalities is strict; continuity holds if for all prospects fi ,
the sets gi ∈ Pi 	 gi i fi  and gi ∈ Pi 	 gi i fi  are both
closed in Cin , i = 1 2
4.2. Trade-off Consistency
To deﬁne trade-off consistency we introduce some
notation. For x ∈ Ci , fi ∈ Pi , i = 1 2 and j ∈ S deﬁne


xj fi = f1i      fj−1i  x fj+1i      fni 
that is, xj fi is the prospect fi with fji replaced by x.
Let a b c d ∈ C1 . We write
ab ∼∗1 cd
if (i) there exist f1  g1 ∈ P1 , and f2 ∈ P2 and a state j
such that
aj f1  f2  ∼ bj g1  f2 

and

cj f1  f2  ∼ dj g1  f2 

where aj f1 , bj g1 , cj f1 , and dj g1 are sign-comonotonic on C1 , or (ii) there exist v w ∈ C2 , and f1 ∈ P1
such that

indifferences, everything outside state of nature 1 is
kept ﬁxed. The ∼∗1 relationship may be interpreted
as measuring strength of preference. For example,
if a > b, from the indifferences aj f1  f2  ∼ bj g1  f2 
and cj f1  f2  ∼ dj g1  f2 , we can see that ab ∼∗1 cd
means that, in the presence of f2 , a trade-off of a for
b is an equally good improvement as a trade-off of
c for d: both exactly offset receiving f1 instead of g1
for all other states of nature. A similar interpretation
can be assigned to the indifferences a1 f1  v1 f2  ∼
b1 f1  w1 f2  and c1 f1  v1 f2  ∼ d1 f1  w1 f2 . The
∼∗1 relations are deﬁned entirely in terms of observed
indifferences and no new primitives beyond observed
choice are assumed in their deﬁnition. Hence, we
stay entirely within the revealed preference paradigm
when using the ∼∗1 relations.
Let w x y z ∈ C2  We deﬁne
wx ∼∗2 yz
if (i) there exist f2  g2 ∈ P2 , and f1 ∈ P1 and a state j
such that
f1  wj f2  ∼ f1  xj g2  and

f1  yj f2  ∼ f1  zj g2 

where wj f2 , xj g2 , yj f2 , and zj g2 are sign-comonotonic on C2  or (ii) there exist a b ∈ C1 , and f2 ∈ P2
such that
a1 f1  w1 f2  ∼ b1 f1  x1 f2  and
a1 f1  y1 f2  ∼ b1 f1  z1 f2 
where w1 f2 , x1 f2 , y1 f2 , and z1 f2 are rank-ordered
prospects in P2 and a1 f1 , and b1 f1 are rank-ordered
prospects in P1 .
We say that  satisﬁes trade-off consistency on C1
if improving the ﬁrst attribute of an outcome in any
∼∗1 relationship breaks that relationship. That is, if
ab ∼∗1 cd and a 1 a then it cannot be that a b ∼∗1 cd.
Loosely speaking, trade-off consistency on C1 ensures
that the ∼∗1 relationship is well-behaved when interpreted as a strength of preference relationship. If the
strength of preference of a over b is equal to the
strength of preference of c over d, then the strength of
preference of a over b cannot be equal to the strength
of preference of c over d, when a is strictly better
than a.
Similarly,  satisﬁes trade-off consistency on C2 if
improving the second attribute of an outcome in
any ∼∗2 relationship breaks that relationship. That is,
if wx ∼∗2 yz and y  2 y then it cannot be that
wx ∼∗2 y  z. Trade-off consistency holds if trade-off consistency holds both on C1 and on C2 . An important
advantage of trade-off consistency as a preference
condition is that it is closely related to measurements of utility by the trade-off method (Wakker and
Deneffe 1996). This makes it easy to test trade-off

consistency empirically. Empirical studies that have
used the trade-off method include Abdellaoui (2000),
Etchart-Vincent (2004), Schunk and Betsch (2006), and
Abdellaoui et al. (2007) amongst others.
Trade-off consistency is a powerful condition. It has
two effects. First, it ensures that we can deﬁne
prospect theory functionals for both attributes and
second, it ensures that the overall evaluation is additive in these two prospect theory functionals.
4.3. Representation for Two Attributes
To derive the representing functional for preferences,
we need an additional assumption. Solvability holds if
for any two prospects f  g ∈ P there exists outcomes
 and  such that (1 f1  f2  ∼ g and f1  1 f2  ∼ g.
Solvability implies that the attribute utility functions
U1 and U2 are unbounded.
The next theorem characterizes Equation (4).
Theorem 1. The following two statements are equivalent:
(i)  is represented by the functional in Equation (4)
with strictly increasing weighting functions W1+ , W1− , W2+ ,
and W2− and continuous, strictly increasing utility functions U1 and U2 .
(ii)  satisﬁes (1) weak ordering, (2) continuity,
(3) weak separability, (4) outcome monotonicity, (5) solvability, and (6) trade-off consistency.
The uniqueness results of prospect theory apply, that is,
the weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− , i = 1 2, are
uniquely determined, and the utility functions U1 and U2
are joint ratio scales.

5.

Common Weighting Functions

In the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, the weighting
functions may differ across the two attributes. In some
cases, however, it might be reasonable to take the
weighting functions independent of the attributes.
Empirical evidence suggests, for example, that decision weights for money and for health are close
(Abdellaoui 2000 compared with Bleichrodt and Pinto
2000). Using common weighting functions facilitates
the use of prospect theory in practical applications,
because fewer elicitations are required. In this section
we will give a preference foundation for the special
case of Equation (4) where the weighting functions do
not depend on the attributes.
By continuity and connectedness of C1 and C2 , there
exist gains x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2 and losses y1 ∈ C1
and y2 ∈ C2 , such that x1  r2  ∼ r1  x2  and y1  r2  ∼
r1  y2  and, hence, such that U1 x1  = U2 x2  and
U1 y1  = U2 y2 . Recall that r is the constant prospect
that gives r1  r2  in every state of nature. For any
event B, let xB f denote the prospect f with fj replaced
by x for all j in B. We can now deﬁne a condition
that ensures attribute independence of the weighting
functions for gains and for losses.

<-----Page 6----->Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: Additive Utility in Prospect Theory

869

Management Science 55(5), pp. 863–873, © 2009 INFORMS

We say that  satisﬁes attribute-independence for
states, if for all x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2 for which x1  r2  ∼
r1  x2  and for all events B, x1  r2 B r ∼ r1  x2 B r. Note
that the condition holds for all x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2 ,
but x1 and x2 must be either both gains or both losses
for otherwise the indifference x1  r2  ∼ r1  x2  cannot
obtain.
We will now explain the idea behind the condition.
As mentioned before, if x1  r2  ∼ r1  x2  then U1 x1  =
U2 x2 . If Equation (4) holds and x1 and x2 are both
gains, the indifference x1  r2 B r ∼ r1  x2 B r implies
that W1+ BU1 x1  = W2+ BU2 x2  and W1+ B = W2+ B
follows from U1 x1  = U2 x2 . A similar line of argument shows that W1− B = W2− B whenever x1 and x2
are losses. Because these equalities hold for all
events B, we obtain the following result:
Corollary 2. If we add attribute-independence for
states to statement (ii) of Theorem 1, then the weighting functions in statement (i) of Theorem 1 are attributeindependent, i.e., W1+ = W2+ = W + and W1− = W2− = W − .
If 1 = 2 and A1 = A2 then Corollary 2 also implies
that the decision weights  + and  − are attributeindependent. This follows from the deﬁnition of the
decision weights, Equations (5a) and (5b). Having
the weighting functions independent of the attributes
does not make the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation equal
to the holistic evaluation. This is easily seen by referring back to the example of the RA considering the
new job. Under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation with
common weighting functions, Equation (7) becomes
1+ u1 80 − u1 50 + 1− 2 u2 15 − u2 20
+ 2− 1 u1 40 − u1 50 + 2+ u2 30 − u2 15
showing that the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation clearly
differs from the holistic evaluation, Equation (6).
Note that it is not only the presence of the loss aversion parameter that distinguishes the holistic from the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation. In general, the two evaluations differ even if a prospect yields only gains or
only losses. Consider again the job offer example but
suppose now that the RA’s reference point for annual
earnings is $30K and for research time it is 10 hours
per week. The preference $80K 15 h  $40K 30 h
still holds. Let E1 denote the event “husband ﬁnds a
job” and E2 the event “husband does not ﬁnd a job.”
Under the holistic evaluation, the job’s value is


W + E1  u1 80+u2 15−u1 30+u2 10



+ 1−W + E1  u1 40+u2 30−u1 30+u2 10 
and under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation it is

 


W + E1  u1 80−u1 30 + 1−W + E2  u2 15−u2 10



+ 1−W + E1  u1 40−u1 30


+W + E2 u2 30−u2 10 

Equality only holds if W + E1  = 1 − W + E2 , i.e.,
if W + E1  + W + E2  = 1. This must hold for all
events E1 and E2 , and for the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation this can only be the case if W + is a probability measure. A similar argument can be used to
derive that W − must be a probability measure. Hence,
for outcomes of the same sign and attribute independent weighting, the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation
agrees with the holistic evaluation only when both
representations reduce to subjective expected utility.

6.

More Than Two Attributes

We will now extend our results to more than two
attributes. Let C = C1 × · · · × Cm , m > 2. Each Ci is a
nondegenerate convex subset of . The reference point
on the ith attribute is denoted ri and is assumed to
be an interior point of Ci . We will denote the set of
prospects on Cin as Pi and write prospects as f1      fm .
Let gi f denote the prospect f ∈ P with fi replaced by
gi , and let gi hk f denote the prospect f ∈ P with fi
replaced by gi and fk replaced by hk . Weak separability
is now deﬁned as follows: for all i ∈ 1     m, fi  gi ∈
Pi , f   g  ∈ P , fi f   gi f  iff fi g   gi g  . The deﬁnitions of
outcome monotonicity, continuity, and solvability easily generalize to the case of more than two attributes.
For trade-off consistency we deﬁne
ab ∼∗i cd
if (i) there exist fi  gi ∈ Pi , f ∈ P , and a state j such that
aj fi i f ∼ bj gi i f

and

cj fi i f ∼ dj gi i f 

where aj fi , bj gi , cj fi , and dj gi are sign-comonotonic on Ci , or (ii) there exist v w ∈ Ck , and f ∈ P
such that
a1 fi i v1 fk k f ∼ b1 fi i w1 fk k f

and

c1 fi i v1 fk k f ∼ d1 fi i w1 fk k f 
where a1 fi , b1 fi , c1 fi , and d1 fi are rank-ordered
prospects in Pi and v1 fk , and w1 fk are rank-ordered
prospects in Pk .
Trade-off consistency holds if each ∼∗i -relationship
satisﬁes trade-off consistency on Ci .
We are now in a position to extend Theorem 1 to
the case of more than two attributes.
Theorem 3. The following two statements are equivalent:

(i)  is represented by V = m
i=1 Vi fi  where the Vi
are prospect theory functionals with strictly increasing
weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− and continuous, strictly
increasing utility functions Ui .

<-----Page 7----->Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: Additive Utility in Prospect Theory

870

(ii)  satisﬁes (1) weak ordering, (2) continuity,
(3) weak separability, (4) outcome monotonicity, (5) solvability, and (6) trade-off consistency.
The uniqueness results of prospect theory apply, that is,
the weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− are uniquely determined, and the utility functions Ui are joint ratio scales.
Attribute independence can easily be extended to
the case of more than two attributes, so that the
arguments preceding Corollary 2 can still be used
to ensure that the weighting functions are attributeindependent.

7.

General Outcomes

For ease of exposition, we have assumed thus far
that all attributes are numerical. In many real-world
decisions, this assumption is too restrictive. An example is health, the area in which decision analysis is
most frequently applied (Keller and Kleinmuntz 1998,
Smith and von Winterfeldt 2004). Health consists of
two dimensions, survival duration and health quality, and health quality is a nonnumeric attribute. The
extension of our analysis to nonnumeric attributes is
as follows.
Assume that the Ci are connected topological
spaces. C = C1 × · · · × Cm is endowed with the product
topology and so is C n . The reference points ri are in
the interior of Ci for each i. Redeﬁne outcome monotonicity as follows: for all i, if fji  gji for all j then
fi i gi . The strict version of outcome monotonicity is
not necessary here as it follows from the version with
weak preferences and trade-off consistency (Köbberling and Wakker 2003, Lemma 26). We can now state
the extension of our results to nonnumeric attributes.
Corollary 4. If the Ci , i = 1     m, are connected
topological spaces, then Theorems 1 and 3 still hold if we
drop in (i), the requirement that the attribute-wise utility
functions are strictly increasing.
The proof of this claim follows easily from the
proofs of Theorems 1 and 3. Corollary 2 can still
be used to ensure that the weighting functions are
attribute-independent.

8.

Empirical Measurement

A few comments concerning the empirical implementability of additive prospect theory under the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation are worth mentioning.
For empirical purposes a ﬁrst step is obviously the
veriﬁcation of the preference conditions that have
been identiﬁed in this paper. When these are satisﬁed, the elicitation of the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is simpler than that of the holistic evaluation
because we do not need to know the ranking of outcomes. Essentially, we can apply the known elicitation

techniques for single-dimensional prospect theory to
each of the attributes. When attribute-independence
for states holds, the weighting functions have to be
assessed only once.
A procedure to measure utility under prospect
theory was recently proposed by Abdellaoui et al.
(2007). Their method uses various elicitation techniques (probability equivalence, certainty equivalence,
and Wakker and Deneffe’s 1996 trade-off method).
A simpler procedure was proposed by Abdellaoui
et al. (2008). Their method only uses certainty equivalence questions but is less general than the procedure
of Abdellaoui et al. (2007) in that it assumes that the
utility functions are power functions.
The weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− , i ∈ 1     m
can be measured either through the nonchoice-based
methods of Tversky and Fox (1995), Fox and Tversky
(1998), Wu and Gonzalez (1999), or Kilka and
Weber (2001) or through the choice-based method of
Abdellaoui et al. (2005). If probabilities are known
then the methods of Abdellaoui (2000) or Bleichrodt
and Pinto (2000) can be applied.
We can also use the representation results for
single-dimensional prospect theory (Prelec 1998,
Wakker and Tversky 1993, Wakker and Zank 2002)
to restrict the functional forms of the utility functions and the weighting functions. If preferences
do not change when we multiply all levels of an
attribute by a common constant (while holding the
other attribute constant), then the attribute utility
function must be a power function. If preferences
are invariant to adding a constant to all levels of
an attribute such that the sign of the attribute levels is preserved (and the other attribute is held
constant), then the attribute utility function is exponential. When probabilities are known and preferences satisfy Prelec’s (1998) compound invariance
conditions, then the weighting functions must have
the form w i p = exp−i ln−p , i = + −. Conditions for deriving exponential or power weighting
functions are presented in Diecidue et al. (2009).

Appendix. Proofs
Proof of Theorem 1. That (i) implies (ii) is routine.
Hence we assume (ii) and derive (i).
By weak order, weak separability, outcome monotonicity,
and continuity,  on P can be represented by V V1 f1 
V2 f2  with V strictly increasing in V1 and V2 . V1 represents
1 and V2 represents 2 . By continuity, V1 and V2 are continuous, by outcome monotonicity, they are strictly increasing.
We will now show that V1 and V2 are prospect theory
functionals. For a prospect f1 ∈ P1 , deﬁne the prospect f1+

<-----Page 8----->Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: Additive Utility in Prospect Theory
Management Science 55(5), pp. 863–873, © 2009 INFORMS

by f1j+ = f1j if f1j 1 r1 and by f1j+ = r1 otherwise, and the
prospect f1− by f1j− = f1j if f1j ≺1 r1 and by f1j− = r1 otherwise. That is, f1+ is the positive part of f1 and f1− is its
negative part. In a similar fashion, we deﬁne f2+ and f2− .
Consider 1 on P1 . Because  satisﬁes outcome monotonicity and C1 is nondegenerate, all states of nature are
nonnull (a state is null if replacing any outcomes in that
state does not affect the preference). Also, because r1 lies
in the interior of C1 , 1 is truly mixed (1 is truly mixed
if there exists a prospect f1 such that f1+  r1 and f1+ ≺ r1 ,
that is, genuine trade-offs between gains and losses occur).
By Theorem 12 in Köbberling and Wakker (2003) there
exists a prospect theory representation for 1 with U1 , the
continuous utility function over C1 , U1 r1  = 0, and W1+ ,
and W1− , the weighting functions over gains and losses on
the ﬁrst attribute, respectively. Köbberling and Wakker’s
(2003) weak monotonicity follows from outcome monotonicity and sign-comonotonic trade-off consistency follows
from trade-off consistency on C1 . By Proposition 8.2 in
Wakker and Tversky (1993), gain-loss consistency can be
dropped from Köbberling and Wakker’s (2003) conditions
when the number of states of nature exceeds two. This is
the case in our analysis if we interpret attributes as events
(Sarin and Wakker 1998, Corollary B.3). U1 is strictly increasing because V1 is strictly increasing. W1+ and W1− are strictly
increasing by outcome monotonicity. By Observation 13 in
Köbberling and Wakker (2003), U1 is a ratio scale and W1+
and W1− are unique. By solvability, U1 is unbounded.
By a similar line of argument, there exists a prospect
theory representation for 2 , with U2 the continuous and
strictly increasing utility function on C2 , U2 r2  = 0, U2 a
ratio scale, and W2+ and W2− the unique and strictly increasing weighting functions over gains and losses on the second
attribute, respectively. By solvability, U2 is unbounded.
So far we have shown that V PT1 f1  PT2 f2  represents . It remains to show that V is additive. We will
do so by showing that the rate of trade-offs between
PT1 and PT2 is everywhere constant. Take f1 ∈ P1  and
let f2 be a rank-ordered prospect in P2 . Take 10 ∈ C2 such
that 10  f22 . Then 10 1 f2 is a rank-ordered prospect
in P2 . Let g2 be such that f2j  g2j for all j with at least
one of these preferences strict. By solvability there exists
an outcome 11 such that (f1  10 1 f2  ∼ f1  11 1 g2 . By
outcome monotonicity 11 2 10 . Next we consider the
prospect (f1  11 1 f2 . By solvability we can ﬁnd an outcome 12 such that (f1  11 1 f2  ∼ f1  12 1 g2  Hence,
12 11 ∼∗2 11 10 . We proceed in this manner to construct
a standard sequence 10  11     on the second attribute for
which 1s 1s−1 ∼∗2 11 10 for all natural s. It is easily veriﬁed that this implies that PT2 1s 1 f2  − PT2 1s−1 1 f2  =
PT2 11 1 f2  − PT2 10 1 f2 . Suppose without loss of generality that PT2 11 1 f2  − PT2 10 1 f2  = 1.
Next we construct a standard sequence 10  11     on the
ﬁrst attribute by eliciting indifferences 1t 1 f1  10 1 f2  ∼
1t−1 1 f1  11 1 f2 , t = 1 2     such that all prospects
involved are rank-ordered. These indifferences imply that
1t 1t−1 ∼∗1 11 10 for all natural t and, thus that PT1 1t 1 f1 −
PT1 1t−1 1 f1  = PT1 11 1 f1  − PT1 10 1 f1 . The indifferences also deﬁne a rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 .
Let PT1 11 1 f1  − PT1 10 1 f1  = c. Then the rate of
trade-off between PT1 and PT2 is constant for all the

871
points we have elicited thus far. This claim follows from
trade-off consistency. By trade-off consistency, we must
have 11 1 f1  1s−1 1 f2  ∼ 10 1 f1  1s 1 f2  for any s =

we must have 1t 1 f1  1s−1 1 f2  ∼ 1t−1 1 f1  1s 1 f2 
for any s = 1 2   ; t = 1 2     Hence the rate of trade-off
between PT1 and PT2 is everywhere c.
Next we double the density of the grid 10  11     ×
10  11     that we constructed above. By continuity of U2

rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 is still constant when
we double the density of the grid.
We continue this doubling of density inﬁnitely, creat−m

0  1      m = 2     On the resulting increasingly ﬁne
grids the rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 remains
constant by a similar proof as for the case where the density
of the grid was doubled.
Because U1 and U2 are unbounded, for any natural m
−m
there can be no x1 ∈ C1 and no x2 ∈ C2 such that x1  2t

for all t or x2  s
for all s. There can also be no outcomes inﬁnitely close to 10 and 10 in the sense that there is
always an outcome from the grid that lies between an outcome x1 ∈ C1 and 10 , and an outcome from the grid that lies
between an outcome x2 ∈ C2 and 10 when x1 is unequal to
10 and x2 is unequal to 10 . If x2 = 10 then U2 x2  − U2 10  =
c > 0 and, hence, there exists a natural number m such that
−m
2−m < c. By construction, there is an element 21 of the grid
1
2−m
such that 0 ≺ 1 ≺ x2 . A similar argument shows that the
grid interferes everywhere. Let x2 and y2 be two outcomes
such that x2  y2 . Suppose that U2 x2  − U2 y2  = d > 0. Then
there exists a natural number m such that 2−m < d and by
−m
construction there is an element 2s of the grid such that
2−m
y 2 ≺ s ≺ x 2 .
Finally, because U1 and U2 are unbounded there cannot be elements x1 and x2 that are so bad that they
are never included in any grid. Consider an outcome x2 .
Then we can construct a prospect f2 with f2j = x2 for
all j. Because U2 is unbounded, we can construct a
prospect g2 such that f2j  g2j for all j. Let 10 = x2 and construct a new grid by eliciting indifferences (f1  10 1 f2  ∼

f1  11 1 g2  f1  11 1 f2  ∼ f1  12 1 g2 ) etc. This produces a dense grid that includes x2 .
By continuity we can extend the dense grid to all outcomes. Hence, we have shown that on the whole domain
the rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 is constant for
rank-ordered prospects. Hence, for rank-ordered prospects
V PT1 f1  PT2 f2  is additive: V f  = PT1 f1  + PT2 f2 
Because U1 and U2 are continuous and unbounded and C1
and C2 are connected, we can for any prospects f1 and f2
ﬁnd rank-ordered prospects g1 and g2 such that f1 ∼1 g1
and f2 ∼2 g2 . We set V PT1 f1  PT2 f2  = PT1 g1  + PT2 g2 
Finally, we show that PT1 f1  + PT2 f2  represents . Suppose that f  g There are rank-ordered prospects f  and g 
such that f  ∼ f and g  ∼ g By transitivity, f   g   Hence,
PT1 f1  + PT2 f2  = PT1 f1  + PT2 f2  ≥ PT1 g1  + PT2 g2  =
PT1 g1 +PT2 g2  which completes the proof of statement (i).
The uniqueness results follow from the uniqueness
results for PT1 and PT2 combined with the fact that on each
grid the rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 must be constant. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. 
Proof of Theorem 3. That (i) implies (ii) is routine.
Hence, we assume (ii) and derive (i). The proof is very
similar to the proof of Theorem 1 and will not be elaborated here. By weak separability V V1 f1      Vm fm  with
V strictly increasing in each of the Vi represents . We then
use the results of Köbberling and Wakker (2003) to show
that each Vi has a prospect theory representation. Finally,
we show, exactly as in the proof of Theorem 1, that for all
i k ∈ 1     m, the rate of trade-off between any PTi and
PTk is constant. This establishes the proof. 
