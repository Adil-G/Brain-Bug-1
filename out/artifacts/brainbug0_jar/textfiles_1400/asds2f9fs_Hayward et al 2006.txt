his paper develops a hubris theory of entrepreneurship to explain why so many new ventures are created
in the shadow of high venture failure rates: More conﬁdent actors are moved to start ventures, and then
act on such conﬁdence when deciding how to allocate resources in their ventures. Building on theory and
evidence from the behavioral decision-making literature, we describe how founders’ socially constructed conﬁdence affects the manner in which they interpret information about their prior and current ventures. We then
link founders’ propensity to be overconﬁdent to their decisions to allocate, use, and attain resources. In our
model, founders with greater socially constructed conﬁdence tend to deprive their ventures of resources and
resourcefulness and, therefore, increase the likelihood that their ventures will fail.

Introduction

Manufacturers that up to 62% and 80% of all new
chemistry industry plants exited within 5 and 10 years
of starting, respectively, with most exits being failures
(Dunne et al. 1989).
Why and when do founders form these ventures in
the presence of such failure rates?2 A hubris theory
of entrepreneurship models how more overconﬁdent
actors are more likely to initiate and incorporate ventures and how their ventures are also more likely to
fail. Greater overconﬁdence provides founders with
the bravado to undertake and persist with more challenging tasks and the conviction that they will have
the necessary resources for their ventures to succeed
(Cialdini 1998). The number of ventures present in an
economy, therefore, depends on the supply of overconﬁdent actors who are willing to start ventures.

“Looking back on it, my judgment was often terribly wrong,” said one entrepreneur who had burned
through more than $20 million trying to launch a Webbased business. “Unfortunately, I was never in doubt.”
(Kramer 2003, p. 63)

A good theory of entrepreneurship should explain
the supply of ventures, which depends on the formation of new ventures and the exit, including failure, of existing ones. It is puzzling and intriguing that
so many ventures start in the presence of the alarmingly high rates of venture failure (e.g., 574,300 ﬁrms
were started, or made their ﬁrst sale, in the United
States in 2000; see Shook et al. 2003).1 Data from the
U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Information Tracking
Series shows that of the ventures started between 1989
and 1992, 34% did not survive the ﬁrst two years,
50% did not survive four years, and 60% did not
survive six years (Headd 2003; see also Phillips and
Kirchhoff 1989 for similar results). These data are consistent with plant-level data from the U.S. Census of

We emphasize that not all founders are overconﬁdent and, even if
they were, their overconﬁdence could beneﬁt themselves and their
ventures (Taylor and Brown 1988). In keeping with our research
question, though, we seek to link founder overconﬁdence with venture starts and failures; and so, we focus on the “dark side” of
overconﬁdence, which is also called hubris. Although others scholars have focused on this “dark side” and recognized that founders’
attributes can also be a source of their demise (Kets de Vries 1985,
Miller 1990), in this paper we focus exclusively on overconﬁdence,
its role in the founding process, and how founder overconﬁdence
limits ventures’ abilities to recover from founding disadvantages.

Venture failure arises when a venture becomes insolvent and is
unable to attract new debt or equity capital, and, consequently,
cannot continue to operate under its current ownership and management (Shepherd 2003).

When founders are overconﬁdent, they overestimate the likelihood that their ventures will succeed
and that they can ensure such success (Kahneman
and Tversky 1995 refer to this as “optimistic overconﬁdence”). In particular, we deﬁne overconﬁdence
as arising when founders overestimate the personal
wealth that they will generate from their ventures.
For further precision, we examine the overconﬁdence that arises for founders who attain the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant round of external debt or equity ﬁnancing for their ventures (e.g., Tyebjee and Bruno
1984). The fate of these resources then becomes subject to founders’ judgment. Our explanation focuses
on socially-constructed conﬁdence, founders’ beliefs
about the success of the project that rests on their
interpretation of their experiences, skills, and project
qualities. In general, a social-constructivist perspective implies that such perceptions often do not reﬂect
the underlying project, skills, and environment determinants that drive failure.3
Before developing such a theory, we offer explanations for the puzzle that motivates this paper: Why
do founders start ventures when the objective likelihood of success is so very low? Put another way,
how do founders interpret the high base rates of venture failure? Answers to these questions motivate us
to develop theory that pertains to our research questions: How does actor overconﬁdence explain venture
formation? How does founder overconﬁdence explain
venture failure?

Venture Formation in the Light of the
Base Rates of Venture Failure

It is conceivable that founders and other investors
lack information about the hazards of starting new
ventures. Lacking a central and authoritative source
of these data, and knowledge about the contingencies in which they apply, prospective founders may
ﬁnd that these different data are abstract, confounding, or unhelpful. Alternatively, founders may be
simply unaware of these data or their implications,
say, because they are not brought to their attention
or they lack the skills to make sense of them. We
searched unsuccessfully for systematic evidence that
might inform this explanation of venture formation
3
Given that overconﬁdence is highly typical of the founders who
we describe, we believe that it is still appropriate to use the label
“overconﬁdent founders,” even though there may be exceptions
(Cooper et al. 1988). Overconﬁdence is typically deﬁned at an
aggregate level, such that positive outcomes occur less often than
expected. This aggregate comparison may be a set of judges, each
of whom makes one prediction, allowing one to determine if the
set of judges is overconﬁdent, or, to deﬁne overconﬁdence at an
individual level, each judge may make a set of predictions, and
overconﬁdence is computed by comparing the expected level of
success with the obtained level.

in the presence of high venture failure rates. Another
explanation is that founders may be aware of the hazards of starting ventures, but are indifferent to venture
failure because they do not bear its costs (Tversky
and Kahneman 1986). At least three factors cast doubt
about the robustness of this form of explanation.
First, founders invest in ventures either because they
wish to share in the ﬁnancial gains or because other
investors require that founders have incentive for
the venture to succeed (Shane and Venkataraman
2000). Second, venture failure has the potential to
undermine founders’ emotional, ﬁnancial, and social
resources (Podolny 2001, Shepherd 2003). Speciﬁcally,
venture failure can stigmatize founders, which at
minimum can increase founders’ cost of capital on
subsequent ventures. Third, to varying degrees venture capitalists and other investors actively monitor
founders’ attempts to use ventures for their personal
use (Cable and Shane 1997).
Founders also have idiosyncratic and personal reasons for starting ventures, including helping family
members and gaining greater autonomy over their
work. Common to each of these motives, however, is
that the nonﬁnancial beneﬁts of ventures to founders
are contingent on venture survival: Even if founders
accept lower ﬁnancial returns, they still require that
their ventures will survive long enough for the nonﬁnancial beneﬁts to overcome losses from failure.
Actors have less scope to view founding as a fun way
to participate in a high stakes lottery to the extent
that gains take time to materialize and failing imposes
personal costs on founders.
The complementary explanation that we offer is
that founders are aware that most ventures fail, but
believe that they can beat the odds of failure. Our
focus here is on relatively informed or experienced
founders who are aware of these base rates of failure because the process by which hubris arises for
informed founders may differ from that by which
it arises for uninformed or naïve founders who are
unaware of base failure rates; this latter process is
beyond our present scope. Furthermore, we suspect
that the effects of hubris will be stronger among lessinformed founders because they are less familiar and
equipped to deal with the elementary risk factors
that cause venture failure. Moreover, this explanation and choice of founders is consistent with evidence that overconﬁdence pervades decisions that
have low base rates of success; founders are overconﬁdent relative to other overconﬁdent actors and managers; and that founders act on such overconﬁdence
once their ventures form (Busenitz and Barney 1997,
Camerer and Lovallo 1999). Following this reasoning, we deﬁne venture overconﬁdence as the extent
to which founders, when founding their ventures,
overestimate the wealth that they will generate from

their ventures. In turn, such overconﬁdence is closely
linked to founders’ subjective interpretation of information concerning their ability to ensure such survival. To elaborate this explanation, we now turn to
the bases of overconﬁdence as found in evidence on
behavioral decisions and founders.

The Bases of Founder Overconﬁdence

Our hubris account of overconﬁdence incorporates
three separate and potentially independent psychological processes: (1) overconﬁdence in knowledge,
(2) overconﬁdence in prediction, and (3) overconﬁdence in personal abilities. The majority of judgment studies examine overconﬁdence in metacognition,
that is, how accurately people assess their own knowledge. As a general rule, people are more certain than
they should be that they know the correct answers to
questions of geography, demography, or other aspects
of general knowledge. Overconﬁdence is particularly
likely when tasks are difﬁcult and/or when judgments are made with high conﬁdence, conditions that
characterize those which founders face (Lichtenstein
et al. 1982, Schraw and Roedel 1994).4
Similar patterns of overconﬁdence are found in predictions about future outcomes. Predictions are most
likely to be overconﬁdent when the target outcome
is rare, when the evidence available is only weakly
diagnostic, and/or when predictions are made with
high conﬁdence (Lichtenstein et al. 1982, Vallone et al.
1990). While this evidence from students’ daily lives
is found in a setting that is markedly different from
those facing founders, there are similarities: Ventures
routinely fail, initial plans for a venture provide a
weak guide to its future performance, and founders
are generally highly conﬁdent.
In laboratory studies, overconﬁdence increases on
tasks with higher base rates of failure, even when
actors are informed of the actual base rates (Dunning
et al. 1990). In a review of expert predictions, Koehler
et al. (2002) found a similar story even with on-thejob judgments of lawyers, physicians, and economists.
They concluded that overconﬁdence—in knowledge
or in prediction—is likely to be found whenever the
evidence appears strong, but is in fact weakly predictive, due to a noisy environment or a low outcome
base rate. In essence, then, these forms of overconﬁdence are generally situationally driven, such that
overconﬁdence will tend to be strongest in the uncertain environments that founders tend to operate in.
4
This research has been based on overconﬁdence in absolute performance (e.g., whether one’s venture will survive). Moore and Cain
(2004) found that individuals were more overconﬁdent in entering
“simple” industries than more difﬁcult ones when the focus was
relative performance (e.g., whether one’s venture will be an “above
average” performer).

However, there is still the potential that some individuals may be more prone to selectively perceiving and
interpreting ambiguous evidence as strong evidence,
such as visionary founders. This type of individual
difference underlying overconﬁdence is unlikely to be
detected by laboratory studies of general knowledge
questions or bets about the future.
In many ways, founders are selected by the market for their level of self-conﬁdence and persistence.
They are also selected for their ability to make coherent sense out of uncertain and contradictory evidence.
Finally, by deﬁnition, entrepreneurial founders operate in settings where information and evidence is
highly uncertain, feedback is scarce, and positive outcomes are rare. Together, these make up a powerful recipe for the type of overconﬁdence that we link
to hubris. Note, however, that our hubris account
of overconﬁdence departs from standard economic
accounts (e.g., Bernardo and Welch 2001) in that it
treats overconﬁdence as neither instrumental (i.e., as if
it exists because it has evolutionary beneﬁts to actors,
ventures, or society) nor fundamental (i.e., as if it were
a primitive aspect of judgment that does not need
explanation). Instead, in our account overconﬁdence
is jointly determined by characteristics of the environment and the individual’s interpretation of the
environment. For example, when environments are
marked by high base rates of success and highly diagnostic and unambiguous evidence, judges are typically underconﬁdent in their predictions (Lichtenstein
et al. 1982, Koehler et al. 2002). We now more fully
elaborate direct evidence of founder overconﬁdence
and its origins.
Direct empirical support exists for the idea that
each of the three types of overconﬁdence that underpin our account of hubris operate amongst founders.
With regard to overconﬁdence in knowledge, Busenitz
and Barney (1997) compared 124 founders with
95 midlevel managers and showed that founders were
signiﬁcantly more overconﬁdent than managers in
their judgment about matters like death rates from
various diseases and accidents. With regard to predictive overconﬁdence, Cooper et al. (1988) found that
81% of the 2,994 founders in their sample rated the
chances that their ventures would succeed at over
70%; and, incredibly, about one third of founders in
this sample believed that such likelihood was fully
100%.5 The same study revealed unrealistic optimism
in the founders sampled: an average 81% probability
of success for their own business dwarfed the 59%
probability of success they saw for businesses like
theirs (a realistic estimate is somewhere in the range
of 30%–70%; see Cooper et al. 1988). Note that among
5
Founders who believe that their ventures will succeed are presumably even more likely to believe that they will not fail.

surviving ventures, many will fail to generate the
wealth that founders’ expect, such that our methodology presents a strong test of the relationship between
founders’ overconﬁdence and the failure of their ventures. Note how this comparative optimism on the
part of the founders sampled helps to argue against
the possibility that founders are simply ignorant of
the low base rates of success.
These ﬁndings reﬂect more overconﬁdent actors’
propensity to overweight the utility of their private
information relative to the value of public information (Bernardo and Welch 2001). That propensity
also causes actors to ignore or under-estimate the
impact of the (1) failure rate of competitors who have
sought similar opportunities in the past, (2) strength
of competitors for focal opportunities, and (3) base
failure rate among all founders (Bar-Hillel 1983,
Kahneman and Lovallo 1993). Because more overconﬁdent founders believe that their private information and skills can overcome the base rates of
failing at uncertain tasks, founders also tend to enter
more exploratory ventures, such as those that involve
riskier product development and carry a higher risk
of failure (Bernardo and Welch 2001).
Overconﬁdence thus surfaces in founder decisions
about which opportunities to pursue, as well as the
risks that founders will accept in mobilizing initial resource endowments. In businesses with greater
variance in uncontrollable outcomes, as with many
new ventures, actors might be expected to more
carefully manage if not control risk. A hubris theory of venture failure points to a different result:
More overconﬁdent founders seek out and underestimate risks (Gervais and Odean 2001). That is,
such founders downplay outcome risk, including that
which is fuelled by competitors, or believe that they
can overcome it, thus underestimating the resource
endowments that their environments require (Shane
and Stuart 2002).
Prospective founders may also be prone to overestimating the performance beneﬁts that they can derive
from their present resources because they neglect
their relevant referent group. Relative to competitors,
more overconﬁdent founders may overestimate customers’ understanding of and appreciation of their
products and services, and underestimate customers’
switching costs (Camerer and Lovallo 1999). Further,
if more overconﬁdent founders overlook new information that disconﬁrms their expectations about their
resources and capabilities, they may exaggerate the
extent to which their resources can confer competitive
advantage. Founders of technology ventures, say, may
overestimate their ability to secure and defend intellectual property rights or underestimate the ability of
competitors to do the same (Erickson and Jacobson
1992, Mansﬁeld 1986). More pertinent here is that

overconﬁdent founders may exaggerate the utility of
their unique personality and leadership skills, relative to competing founders. Founders then are prone
to overconﬁdence with respect to the risks inherent
in the opportunities that they identify and the initial resource endowments that they think will sufﬁce
to pursue those opportunities. Together, these factors
illustrate the manner in which founders overestimate
gains from prospective ventures and so can accelerate
the time from idea to venture formation.
But, this still leaves unaddressed the issue of which
actors are more overconﬁdent and so more likely to
form ventures. A starting point is that one’s genes,
upbringing, and personality might predict one’s level
of conﬁdence, but these hypotheses are difﬁcult to
test, and in fact have received little empirical support (Cosmides and Tooby 1987, Gigerenzer 2002).6
Another perspective that we addressed earlier is that,
subject to actors’ preferences and information, it is
rational for them to found ventures.
The complementary perspective that we develop
is that certain actors who are interested in starting
ventures are stronger candidates to be overconﬁdent
about venture prospects and so are moved to become
founders. Recall that a robust ﬁnding in cognitive psychology is that high conﬁdence is positively correlated
with greater overconﬁdence. The key question that
follows is: What drives conﬁdence if not actual performance? Many studies in social psychology indicate
that high conﬁdence (and hence high overconﬁdence)
is driven by actors’ interpretation or construal of their
experiences, including the cues that they take from
others about such experiences (Kruger and Dunning
1999, Grifﬁn and Ross 1991), and is largely unaffected
by the experiences of others (Ball et al. 1991) or the
features of the situation (Moore and Kim 2003), even
when consideration of others’ experiences and situational features could help improve decision accuracy.
Based on this evidence, we now relate overconﬁdence
to founders’ focal venture tasks and own experience
at founding. Our conceptual approach is that overconﬁdence arises through two broad mechanisms that
relate to these conditions. First, actors may not change
the conﬁdence in their judgment towards a prospective task, but may be less skilled on that task relative to prior tasks. Second, actors can become more
conﬁdent without any gains in their underlying skills
or judgment. In contrast, declines in overconﬁdence
occur when actors maintain their conﬁdence in judgment and become more skilled, say, through greater
experience, as we now elaborate.
The following social-constructivist perspective on
founder overconﬁdence analyzes how founders
become more overconﬁdent by interpreting their focal

164
ventures, their prior ventures, and by taking cues
from salient others.
In this vein, ﬁndings from laboratory studies suggest that actors’ overconﬁdence relates to the complexity of tasks that they are judging (e.g., Vallone
et al. 1990). In particular, this literature shows that
moderately to extremely difﬁcult tasks can directly
increase actor overconﬁdence, whether or not actors
are experienced at those tasks (Lichtenstein and
Fischoff 1977). Thus, we now examine the direct
affects of venture task conditions on actors’ overconﬁdence in venture formation.
Overconﬁdence from Venture Task Conditions
Whereas actors’ assessments of their judgment
become more accurate on simple and repetitive tasks,
they become more overconﬁdent when they tackle
more complex tasks with a greater degree of outcome
uncertainty (Lichtenstein and Fischoff 1977). Following this evidence, we would expect that founder overconﬁdence will increase as their ventures involve
more complex and dynamic tasks.
Complexity refers to “the number of relevant factors available for consideration, how relevant the factors are, and the number of judgments that must
be made” (Wood 1986, p. 375). As actors tackle
more complex tasks, they insufﬁciently allow for the
inherent uncertainty of future outcomes, especially
when they lack guidance as to what the situation
demands (Vallone et al. 1990). Founders can face
greater complexity about the needs of targeted customers; whether their venture can meet those needs,
under what terms, and so forth (Sapienza and Gupta
1994); whether their products and services are sufﬁciently high quality to gain market acceptance, and
so on (Meyer and Utterback 1995). To illustrate, on
the one hand, founders may start a gas station at
a well-known location where product and customer
requirements are relatively clear and cash ﬂows can
be predicted with some accuracy. On the other hand,
founders may form ventures that are predicated on
esoteric technology where cash ﬂows are contingent
on the interplay of unfolding technical and market
uncertainties and so face challenging information processing requirements (Anderson and Tushman 2001,
Dess and Beard 1984). We would expect that founders,
like other actors, will tend to underestimate the difﬁculty of solving more complex problems and so
become more overconﬁdent in their ability to solve
them.
Another dimension that characterizes founders’
tasks is the extent to which the nature of required
tasks changes or is dynamic (Bluedorn 1993, Dess
and Beard 1984). For example, some industries have
high environmental complexity, whereby founders
consider a large number of relevant factors in making judgments (Dess and Beard 1984; Wood 1986,

Focused Issue: A Hubris Theory of Entrepreneurship

Management Science 52(2), pp. 160–172, © 2006 INFORMS

p. 375). Others are more dynamic, such that the
task environment is difﬁcult to identify and change
is unpredictable (Bluedorn 1993), as is common as
with nascent markets (Santos and Eisenhardt 2005).
Faced with greater task dynamism, more overconﬁdent founders risk overcommitting venture resources
to key success factors only to ﬁnd that these change
or otherwise fail to materialize, thereby jeopardizing the venture’s ﬁt with its environment and, in
turn, performance (Ghemawat 1991). In this dynamic,
serial founders tend to extrapolate conﬁdence in their
founding abilities to prospective ventures even as the
utility of such abilities diminishes.
Focusing on the dimensions of complexity and
dynamism provides the basis for a 2 × 2 typology of
task requirements where the level of overconﬁdence
varies across types. We expect that founder overconﬁdence will positively relate to the interaction of the
complexity and dynamism of task requirements such
that (1) founders are most overconﬁdent with high
levels of dynamism and complexity, (2) founders are
moderately overconﬁdent as they tackle complex but
not dynamic tasks or dynamic but not complex tasks,
and (3) founders are least overconﬁdent when their
tasks are neither complex nor dynamic. The relationships between the dimensions of the above industry
typology and overconﬁdence are captured in the following propositions (see Dess and Beard 1984 and
Sutcliffe and Huber 1998 for operationalizations of the
dimensions).
Proposition 1. The greater the environmental complexity that is inherent in the focal venture opportunity,
the greater the founder overconﬁdence.
Proposition 2. The greater the environmental
dynamism that is inherent in the focal venture opportunity,
the greater the founder overconﬁdence.
As actors undertake new tasks that stretch into
the future, they do so at a higher level of abstraction (Lieberman and Trope 1998) and so risk losing
touch with the challenges of meeting key contingencies, such as understanding customer needs and
completion times. Founders sometimes respond to
the uncertainties of complex ventures by imagining
rich projections of critical venture contingencies and
outcomes, as articulated in business plans. Business
plans can provide helpful guidelines that discipline
founders’ actions (Delmar and Shane 2003). Equally,
however, richer business plans show more elaborate scenario and contingency planning, which render actors more conﬁdent about their ability to meet
milestones and deadlines without producing strategies that help them to actually complete a critical
task on time (Buehler et al. 1994, 1997). Founders
may perceive that business plans will help to ensure

that product development and other projects are completed on time, even if they have seen many similar
projects run late (Buehler et al. 1994, p. 366). Thus, we
have:
Proposition 3. Greater business planning by founders
on a focal venture strengthens the positive relationship
between (1) the environmental complexity inherent in the
focal venture opportunity and founder overconﬁdence, and
(2) the environmental dynamism inherent in the focal
venture opportunity and founder overconﬁdence.
Overconﬁdence from Experience at
Venture Founding
In general, greater experience at performing a task
leads actors to become more conﬁdent about their
judgment on such a task (Pincus 1991). When the
task is well deﬁned, repetitive, and can elicit constant
feedback, such judgment also tends to become more
accurate, ex post (Wright 2001). As actors gain experience and feedback from focal tasks, their accuracy
in judgment increases on those tasks at a faster rate
than their conﬁdence, such that their overconﬁdence
diminishes (Keren 1987). This suggests that serial
founders may be less overconﬁdent than novices,
even if serial founders are also more conﬁdent about
their ventures’ prospects. Greater experience increases
founders’ opportunities and motivation to gather
information about the base rates of venture failure (particularly those with ventures that experience
intense rivalry), where and how to gather resources,
and so on. Founding ventures allows founders to
develop richer networks that enable them to raise capital, ﬁnd staff, develop customer and supplier relationships, and so forth (Hellman and Puri 2002, Shane
and Cable 2002). Thus, they become more aware of
the risks of pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities,
especially when their ventures were less successful
than expected. In contrast, novice founders may be
less aware of the base rates of venture failure, and
less sensitive to the personal costs of such failure
(Bar-Hillel 1983).
Some recent evidence indirectly corroborates the
proposition that serial founders are less overconﬁdent
than novices: In a sample of 149 early stage hightech ventures, Hsu (2004) found that greater founding experience increases the likelihood that founders
will seek and acquire more venture capital funding
earlier, and that such funding increases the likelihood that their ventures will survive. If more experienced founders are more mindful of the risks of
venture failure and have greater skill at acquiring critical resources that stave off venture failure, they will
be less overconﬁdent with respect to the prospects of
their ventures relative to novices.
By the same token, the positive relationship
between experience and success becomes confounded

165
as founders undertake ventures that differ from their
prior ones. Using a sample of founders who graduated from Stanford’s MBA program, Lazear (2004)
provides details on a set of actors who have generalist skills and so initiate ventures with quite distinct
technical and market requirements from prior ones.
Different market segments have different task environments with different contingencies that require different skills (Aldrich and Auster 1986, Lawrence and
Lorsch 1967). With their familiarity with the speciﬁc
market segments of their prior ventures, founders
may fail to appreciate the industry-speciﬁc actions
and norms, including strategic proﬁles that new
ventures require.
Thus, as tasks on focal ventures become more dissimilar to prior ones, founders risk exaggerating the
extent to which the judgment and skills that they
used on prior tasks will work on focal ones. This is
especially problematic when founders’ prior experience was particularly successful, and when founders
believe that their skills produced the success, even if
they were just lucky. Our reasoning resonates with
March’s (1997, p. 15) observation that, “successful
decision makers tend to underestimate the risk that
they have experienced and the risk they currently
face, and intentionally risk-averse decision makers
may actually be risk seeking in behavior.” If so,
founders might use successful experience to more
readily imagine how it might feel to achieve ongoing success on different focal ventures, and so neglect
how the base rates of failure differs on such ventures
relative to prior ones (Hayward et al. 2004). Conversely, less successful founders tend to attribute prior
venture failure to misfortune or remarkably difﬁcult
and transient problems that do not apply to focal
ventures.
Above we argued that novice founders are overconﬁdent with respect to the prospects of their focal
ventures relative to more experienced founders. The
key dynamic is that founders’ experience on prior
ventures renders them more conﬁdent on focal ones
without improving their skills to achieve better performance on the current ones. Among experienced
founders, therefore, founders will be overconﬁdent
towards a focal venture to the extent that their prior
experience was successful and that the requirements
on those ventures differ from those on the focal
venture, as below:
Proposition 4. Founders with experience in founding
successful ventures become more overconﬁdent as their
focal venture differs from their previous ventures.
The above propositions develop the conditions that
explain founder overconﬁdence: Founders conﬁdence
is sustained by their interpretation processes, rather
than the qualities of their environment, project, and

166
personal skills that should underlie such conﬁdence.
Understanding the determinants of founder overconﬁdence also helps to explain when founder overconﬁdence has a stronger impact on venture management
and control. Recall the beneﬁcial effects of overconﬁdence for founders, their ventures and society
that have been described elsewhere and which are
beyond our scope here. Rather, a hubris theory of
entrepreneurship must link founder overconﬁdence
to adverse outcomes for founders and their ventures,
factors that contribute to the failure of their ventures.
A challenge in developing such a theory is to
link founder overconﬁdence at venture founding to
founder decisions at that time. While founders make
many decisions that shape the future of their ventures, they must acquire and deploy resources to
pursue critical opportunities, decisions that, as we
will elaborate, shape initial resource endowments and
thus venture survival chances (Bruderl and Schussler
1990, Fichman and Levinthal 1991). We propose that
founders tend to underestimate the initial resource
endowments that their ventures require and overestimate their ability to attain further resources. Further,
we expect that founders who are more overconﬁdent about a venture opportunity will overcommit
resources to such opportunity in the manner that we
elaborate later.

Founder Overconﬁdence and
Venture Failure

Founder overconﬁdence affects founder decisions
about required initial resource endowments—the initial stocks of resources that stakeholders invest in
founding ventures that is present, say, after any given
early round of capital raisings (Shane and Stuart
2002). Greater initial resource endowments enable
founders to invest in the human, technical, organizational, social, and other resources that buffer their
ventures from failure (Bruderl and Schussler 1990).
Founder Overconﬁdence and Initial Venture
Resource Endowments
Various factors suggest that more overconﬁdent
founders will underestimate such requirements and
thus begin their ventures with smaller resource
endowments than less overconﬁdent founders. To
illustrate, by overestimating the value proposition
that their products and services can provide to customers, more overconﬁdent founders also tend to
underestimate the need to educate customers about
such a proposition (Rogers 1983). If more overconﬁdent founders experience greater reference group
neglect, they will also be more prone to underestimating the need to differentiate and protect their
value proposition from competitors (Mahajan 1992).

Focused Issue: A Hubris Theory of Entrepreneurship

Management Science 52(2), pp. 160–172, © 2006 INFORMS

To elaborate further, more overconﬁdent founders
may underestimate the need for and overestimate
their personal ability to (1) secure intellectual property protection, (2) defend intellectual property and
key resources (including personnel) from competitors,
and (3) engage in price-based competition (Erickson
and Jacobson 1992, Mansﬁeld 1986). It follows that
they will perceive the need for smaller initial resource
endowments to deal with such contingencies.
Along similar lines, more overconﬁdent founders
may underestimate their ventures’ requirements for
legitimacy within relevant task environments, thus
underestimating the resources that are required to
build such legitimacy (Suchman 1995). That is, more
overconﬁdent founders may fail to conform to practices that are generally accepted for new ventures
within particular market segments, including using
certain professional services, sets of procedures, documentation, and so forth. Attaining legitimacy also
requires investments in capabilities and operating
procedures that demonstrate that products conform
to customer and industry speciﬁcations (Hannan and
Freeman 1984; Hannan and Carroll 1995, p. 20), and
thus ventures may need to be sufﬁciently large to
meet these requirements (Baldwin and Gorecki 1991).
If overconﬁdent founders sense a lesser need for such
legitimacy, they may be less motivated to demonstrate
such performance and so attract less support from
critical stakeholders (Rao 1994).
Third, to overcome the lack of legitimacy that new
ventures face, founders can use their social ties to
access necessary resources (Shane and Stuart 2002). In
a sample of 50 high-tech ventures, Shane and Cable
(2002) show that direct and indirect ties between
founders and seed-stage investors inﬂuenced which
new ventures were funded. Ties to network partners
facilitate the transfer of difﬁcult-to-codify, knowledgeintensive skills that are more expensive to obtain for
those who lack the relevant ties (Larson 1992, Powell
1990, Uzzi 1996). Thus, founders without direct and
indirect ties to investors are more likely to be denied
requested ﬁnancial resources for their new ventures
(Shane and Stuart 2002).
While actors may found ventures with valuable
social ties, further ties are required to meet venturespeciﬁc contingencies (Florin et al. 2003). If more overconﬁdent founders perceive themselves as a unique
source of competitive advantage for their ventures,
they may also overestimate their personal ability to
develop such ties and manage resource dependencies.
In turn, more overconﬁdent founders may deprive
their ventures of required resources that are available
through those networks.
Taken together, the above factors suggest that
more overconﬁdent founders will underestimate the
resource needs of their ventures. Southwest Airlines’

founder Herb Kelleher captures the spirit of our
argument by commenting that, “   because if you’re
an entrepreneur, you’re optimistic by nature. So you
think, in six months, we’re going to be sailing. But
that optimism causes you to raise a lot less capital
than you need in most cases, and it’s very lonely”
(Morrison 2003). More formally, relative to less overconﬁdent founders, we would expect that more overconﬁdent ones will underestimate their ventures’
need for initial resource endowments.
Proposition 5. More overconﬁdent founders start
their ventures with smaller resource endowments and this
increases the likelihood that their ventures will fail.
Founder Overconﬁdence and Resource
Commitments to Initial Venture Ideas
As they initiate ventures, more overconﬁdent
founders are more likely to overcommit their ventures’ limited resources to the opportunities upon
which their ventures were founded. In our model,
overcommitment refers to an actor’s relative propensity to commit more resources more quickly to a focal
opportunity through three dynamics.
First, if more overconﬁdent founders underestimate
the challenges of extracting value from their ventures,
they may allocate too great a share of their resource
endowment to this initial idea or focal “opportunity.”
Camerer and Lovallo (1999, p. 307) claim that, “Firms
could mistakenly enter (a market) too often for two
different reasons: They know their own skills but
fail to appreciate how many competitors there will
be, or they forecast competition accurately but overconﬁdently think that their ﬁrm will succeed while
most others will fail.” To test this reasoning, they constructed a laboratory experiment in which MBA students were asked to choose the extent to which they
would enter a market where payoffs depended on
entrant skill. Consistent with their expectations, they
found that entrants were more likely to excessively
enter markets when they thought that post-entry performance depended on their skills and neglected the
skill levels of other entrants. Guided by this ﬁnding, we expect that more overconﬁdent founders will
exhibit a similar propensity to excessively enter markets.
Second, more overconﬁdent founders with greater
conviction in the prospects of the customer need
that they are seeking to meet and the strength of
their resources to pursue such opportunity will more
rapidly mobilize resources towards such opportunity. With greater self-efﬁcacy, more overconﬁdent
founders have less reason to wait for market and technical uncertainties to become resolved. Earlier movers
into a market can be disadvantaged if customers are
not ready for new innovations, say, because existing

167
offerings are already “good enough” or because customers lack the skills to use the innovations independently or in conjunction with related products
(Christiansen 1997). Similarly, early movers face a
greater challenge in attaining support for the product
from the value chain participants who source products and get them to market; and so face the costs
of becoming more vertically integrated (Lieberman
and Montgomery 1988). Thus, while founders who
more fully commit their ventures to market opportunities from the outset can help to attain ﬁrst mover
advantages, later entrants can be better placed to evaluate customer preferences and other contingencies
(Mitchell 1991).
Third, if founders overestimate their ability to
extract value from resources that others hold, they
may overpay for such resources. The winner’s curse
is an adverse selection problem in which more overconﬁdent actors overestimate the value that they can
extract from resources and so become the highest
bidders for them (Bazerman and Samuelson 1983).
The premium that actors pay above market price for
resources signals the extra value that buyers expect to
extract from the resource relative to sellers. Hayward
and Hambrick (1997) illustrate these effects by showing that overconﬁdent acquiring managers tend to
pay higher premiums for target businesses. Although
this is a study of acquiring managers at large ﬁrms,
such premiums both signal acquiring managers’ overconﬁdence in the value that they can extract from targets and increase the cost of extracting that value. In a
similar vein, founders may authorize the payment of
premiums over pre-existing or market prices that they
pay for managerial talent, capital goods, acquisitions,
and so on.
Overall, more overconﬁdent founders are prone
to raising insufﬁcient resource endowments for their
ventures. Once those endowments are established,
more overconﬁdent founders will tend to allocate
them too excessively and quickly to focal venture
opportunities. This suggests that more overconﬁdent
founders will unduly deplete the resources that they
have at their disposal, depriving their ventures of
resourcefulness and increasing the likelihood that
their ventures will fail.
Proposition 6. More overconﬁdent founders commit
greater resources to focal opportunities and this increases
the likelihood that their ventures will fail.
Founder Overconﬁdence and Venture Liquidity
Until now, we have focused on how founders’ overconﬁdence at the time of venture founding affects
founders’ decisions to attain and deploy resources at
that point. Systematic evidence from psychology and
behavioral ﬁnance suggests that such overconﬁdence

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded from informs.org by [155.247.166.234] on 25 May 2015, at 05:04 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.

168
is likely to sustain, thus inﬂuencing founders’ decisions beyond venture founding. A substantial literature in social psychology documents the cognitive
inertia in changing previously held beliefs known as
“perseverance” (Anderson et al. 1980). Buehler et al.
(1997) use a familiar annual ritual—paying income
taxes on the day they are due—to illustrate how hope
for the future overcomes learning from the past. Most
of their sample admitted to ﬁnishing the forms no
earlier than the due date in the previous years, but
conﬁdently predicted that they would act earlier in
the coming year. (They did not.) Kruger and Dunning
(1999, p. 1121) suggested that poor-performing actors
sustain overconﬁdence because they are unable to
effectively identify their errors, a problem that they
refer to as “difﬁculties in recognizing one’s own
incompetence.” Camerer and Lovallo (1999) show that
actors’ overconﬁdence increases as they enter markets because, as they continue to survive, they underestimate the strength of their surviving competitors.
Turning to the behavioral ﬁnance literature, Gervais
and Odean (2001) provide an attribution theory-based
model in which traders do not initially know their
ability. In assessing their abilities, traders take too
much credit for success, leading them to become persistently overconﬁdent. In a related study, Gervais
et al. (2004) argue that because overconﬁdent managers underestimate risk, they persistently overcome
the propensity of risk-averse rational managers to
delay projects that are in shareholders’ best interests.
While such persistent overconﬁdence may affect
a number of entrepreneurial decisions, we focus
on those regarding equity-based liquidity events
(founders issue or sell new or existing equity in
their ventures in return for cash) because founders
may overcome the above resource dynamics that we
describe by capitalizing on such events. At issue
here is that more overconﬁdent founders place a
higher value on their skills and judgment and the
value of their ventures relative to others, especially
prospective capital providers and acquirers. More
overconﬁdent founders are thus less likely to reach
an agreement with prospective acquirers and public and private investors over the terms for exchanging venture equity for cash (Neale and Bazerman
1985); and so are less able to capitalize on liquidity events, such as an initial public offering, acquisition by another company, further rounds of venture
capital, liquidating inventory, and so on. Instead, if
more overconﬁdent founders overestimate the value
of their equity, they will seek new capital with fewer
equity claims, especially short-term debt (Landier and
Thesmar 2004).
More overconﬁdent founders also tend to be averse
to liquidity events that dilute their ownership and
so cede control to other managers and investors.

Focused Issue: A Hubris Theory of Entrepreneurship

Management Science 52(2), pp. 160–172, © 2006 INFORMS

As founders link their abilities more closely to their
ventures’ existence and prosperity, they become less
mindful of the preferences and opinions of other
venture stakeholders, including co-managers and
investors. That is, they become more averse to taking
counsel from the managers whom they have hired,
the investors whom they have accepted funding from,
and others who are well positioned to diagnose and
treat problems at their ventures. More overconﬁdent
founders sustain such aversion because they tend to
possess a strong personal need for control that they
can sustain by exercising uncommon power over their
ventures relative to leaders at other organizations
(Kets de Vries 1985). Wasserman (2001, 2003, p. 150)
ﬁnds that, relative to managers at more mature ﬁrms,
founders own “a large percentage of the company
(and) there is much greater inside ownership than
in large ﬁrms.” With greater control, founders exert
greater discretion over the composition of the board
of directors and the senior management team at their
ventures, factors that consolidate founders’ power
(Pfeffer 1981). What can emerge is “inside” thinking (Kahneman and Lovallo 1993), in which founders
focus on the unique features of their skills, opportunity, and resources, leading them to develop reﬁned
scenarios that are based on those qualities. In particular, whereas founders tend to be skilled at identifying
opportunities and convincing others, they generally
lack the detail orientation and operating skills that
are needed to manage costs and choose between conﬂicting growth opportunities.7 As ventures ﬂounder,
venture liquidity becomes more dependent on careful
management of these contingencies (Kazanjian 1988).
Overall, the above suggests that more overconﬁdent
founders will prevent their ventures from capitalizing
on liquidity events because they overvalue their ventures relative to other investors and so are less likely
to come to terms with them. Rather than exchange
their ventures’ equity for cash, more overconﬁdent
founders will rely more extensively on short-term
debt, thereby rendering their venture more at risk to
defaulting on debt servicing and repayment (Landier
and Thesmar 2004). Together, these factors lead more
overconﬁdent founders to reduce their ventures’ liquidity, as follows:
Proposition 7. More overconﬁdent founders reduce
the liquidity of their ventures and this increases the likelihood that their ventures will fail.
To summarize, our hubris theory of entrepreneurship is rooted in theory and evidence on behavioral decisions and predicts when founders are more
7
As ventures complete new product development and raise more
capital, the likelihood that the founder will cede control of the venture to professional CEOs increases, thus reducing the likelihood
that their ventures will fail (Wasserman 2003).

likely to be overconﬁdent and thus start ventures.
In our model, founders are more overconﬁdent upon
founding their ventures when they (1) are less experienced at founding ventures that are similar to
their focal one, and (2) undertake ventures with
more difﬁcult and uncertain core tasks. We then
linked founder overconﬁdence to founders’ tendency
to attain insufﬁcient initial resources for their ventures and overcommit those resources quickly to focal
venture opportunities, factors that increase the likelihood of venture failure. Because more overconﬁdent
founders are less motivated to obtain and manage
venture liquidity, they further jeopardize the survival
of their ventures.

Discussion

A hubris explanation contributes to theory on
entrepreneurship in material ways. Present disciplinary treatments of venture founding and market
entry take the laboratory subject, the ﬁrm, or the
population of ﬁrms as the unit of analysis (Bruderl
et al. 1992, Camerer and Lovallo 1999). Unlike these
perspectives, a hubris theory examines the role of
founders’ overconﬁdence in starting and managing
ventures because it is founders who make the decisions that shape the fate of their ventures (Boeker
1989). A number of actors can start a venture, but
founders generally emerge as highly inﬂuential in initiating the venture and overseeing its resource acquisition and allocation (Schein 1980; see Stevenson and
Jarillo 1990 for a review). With their unique control
over an uncertain and emerging enterprise, founders’
cognitive biases will be reﬂected in decisions that
drive venture formation and failure.
Moreover, while network, institutional, and ecological perspectives help to explain why ventures start
or fail, they do not explain why founders start ventures given the rates of venture failure, and how venture founding systematically relates to venture failure.
A hubris theory of entrepreneurship explains these
empirical regularities because (1) founders’ overconﬁdence upon venture formation is likely to affect
critical founding decisions, and (2) founders’ overconﬁdence is likely to hold after those ventures form and
so continue to affect founders’ decisions (Camerer and
Lovallo 1999, Kruger and Dunning 1999). Similarly,
entrepreneurship scholars examine the antecedents
of venture formation but rarely consider how such
antecedents might relate to venture failure. Thus, this
paper offers a more complete theory of entrepreneurship because it explicates the dynamics by which
founder overconﬁdence is tied to venture failure. Our
research for this paper suggests that a hubris theory of
entrepreneurship is an integrative and undeveloped
one for explaining venture formation and failure.

169
We bridge this gap by theorizing that founder
overconﬁdence helps to explain the puzzle of why
founders start ventures in the face of the high odds
that such ventures will fail. Overconﬁdence, the
central construct of our work, emerges as an enduring motor of the economic prosperity that excessive
venture formation generates, and equally as a brake
on that prosperity. Research on founders’ cognitive
biases as opposed to personality traits is a promising way to address the limitations of network and
ecological perspectives in tackling our focal puzzle of
why so many ventures start in the shadow of high
rates of venture failure. This approach reﬂects evidence that (1) overconﬁdence is a robust bias representing a number of underlying tendencies, and
is most pronounced among people with high selfesteem and the ability to make detailed and convincing plans, (2) cognitive biases like overconﬁdence
are more pronounced when judgment is made under
uncertain conditions, such as those facing founders,
and (3) overconﬁdence is pervasive and robust among
founders (Cooper et al. 1988).
We complement treatments on founder overconﬁdence and its role in venture formation (e.g., Bernardo
and Welch 2001, Cooper et al. 1988) by elaborating how founder overconﬁdence explains the links
between venture formation and failure. In our model,
more overconﬁdent founders obtain smaller initial
resource endowments for their ventures that they
subsequently allocate prematurely and excessively to
focal opportunities. Because they overestimate their
ventures’ prospects, they are also more reluctant to
exchange equity in their ventures for cash. The result
is that more overconﬁdent founders deprive their
ventures of resources and resourcefulness.
In closing, however, it is important to reiterate that
founders (1) are not uniformly overconﬁdent, (2) do
not invariably remain overconﬁdent, and (3) overconﬁdence is not necessarily bad for themselves, their
ventures, and overall entrepreneurial activity.
Potential Beneﬁts from Overconﬁdence
Behavioral decision theorists provide evidence of a
number of factors that limit the operation of overconﬁdence, including situations where actors use counter
factual thinking and seek out timely and authoritative
feedback (Arkes et al. 1987, Grifﬁn and Tversky 1992,
Lichtenstein and Fischhoff 1980). Founders might also
contain their overconﬁdence by assembling diverse
venture teams with members who can point out
different perspectives on risks and opportunities
(Sniezek and Henry 1989). Counterfactual reasoning
counterbalances the “available” information that produces overconﬁdence, thus mitigating overconﬁdence
and its effects (Flannelly and Flannelly 2000, Tetlock
1998). Using different scenarios of what could happen

170
tends to improve judgment (Einhorn and Hogarth
1987, Holyoak and Thagard 1995) because the process of scenario generation and analysis helps actors
to break free from the “mental models” that shape the
way that they solve problems (Dunning et al. 1990,
Koehler 1994). The risk of this approach, however,
is that founders may focus on plan-based scenarios rather than relevant past experiences, the experiences of others, and other kinds of “outside” thinking
(Kahneman and Lovallo 1993).
However, overconﬁdence usually persists. Kruger
and Dunning (1999, p. 1121) argued that: “when people are incompetent in the strategies they adopt to
achieve success and satisfaction, they suffer a dual
burden: Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions
and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence
robs them of the ability to realize it.” That is, these
individuals have only a limited ability to know how
well one is performing, when one is likely to be accurate in judgment, and when one is likely to be in error.
In a different stream of research, developmental psychologists have also investigated the inability of individuals (typically young children) to utilize outcome
feedback and to adapt their behaviors—they refer to
such behavior as perseverance. Although the focus of
this paper has been overconﬁdence at founding and
how continued overconﬁdence can adversely impact
a venture’s ability to overcome initial disadvantages,
future research can make important contributions to
the literature by extending the current study to link
with recent clinical and developmental psychology
research on perseverence (Dihoff et al. 2004, Spencer
and Schutte 2004). It also offers a means to build on
the psychoanalytic tradition of Kets de Vries (1985),
Miller (1990), and others to gain a deeper understanding of the persistence of overconﬁdence in the face of
poor ﬁrm performance and its consequences.
Even if overconﬁdence is pervasive among
founders, it is not universally bad for founders, their
ventures, and economic performance. Overconﬁdence
enhances founders’ self-efﬁcacy by enabling them to
feel good about starting and achieving what they
might not have otherwise (Taylor and Brown 1988).
We are very mindful that overconﬁdence might help
to explain why scholars who are familiar with the
perilous rates of rejection at ﬁne journals still try
to publish there without seeking detailed feedback
from colleagues prior to submission. Returning to
our focal context, we expect that overconﬁdence
might help founders to attract greater resources,
especially from impressionable stakeholders. These
resource providers may feel reassured by founders
who can convey the attractiveness of the opportunity
that they have found and the manner in which they
will exploit it, securing resources in a potentially
self-fulﬁlling prophecy (Merton 1948).

Management Science 52(2), pp. 160–172, © 2006 INFORMS

Even if overconﬁdent founders contribute to venture failure, such failure is not necessarily bad for ventures and entrepreneurial activity (Baumol 1990, 1991;
Van Praag and Cramer 2001). To illustrate, Bernardo
and Welch (2001) model how failing founders, by
virtue of exploring fresh opportunities, convey information that others can ignore or exploit and thus
provide a public service. Moreover, Gervais et al.
(2004) model how more overconﬁdent managers beneﬁt shareholders by acting on projects that risk-averse
managers postpone. Anecdotally, unreasonably conﬁdent entrepreneurs have achieved remarkable outcomes from seemingly far-fetched plans. Amongst
other examples, as a teenager Michael Dell concluded
that he “wanted to compete with IBM.” Herb Kelleher
believed that he would turn Southwest Airlines into
a proﬁtable point-to-point airline, even after rival airlines issued 31 separate administrative and/or judicial proceedings that effectively rendered his business
insolvent. Perhaps it is such unreasonable conﬁdence
which provides entrepreneurs with the resolve and
persuasiveness to enact their plans.
If so, the greater scholarly challenge is not just
to link founder overconﬁdence to venture failure
as we have done here, but to explain and predict how founders’ overconﬁdence affects the nature
and quality of their judgment. Joining this challenge
should yield theory and evidence on how present and
prospective founders will produce better ventures.
