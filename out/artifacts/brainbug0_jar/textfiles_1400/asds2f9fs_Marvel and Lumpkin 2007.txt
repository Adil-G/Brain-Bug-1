Technology
Entrepreneurs’
Human Capital and
Its Effects on
Innovation Radicalness
Matthew R. Marvel

Radical innovations transform existing markets, create new markets, and stimulate economic growth. This study investigates how the experience, education, and prior knowledge
of technology entrepreneurs relate to innovation radicalness. Findings from a sample of
145 technology entrepreneurs operating within university-affiliated incubators suggest that
general and specific human capital are both vital to innovation outcomes. Innovation radicalness was positively associated with formal education and prior knowledge of technology,
but negatively associated with prior knowledge of ways to serve markets. This suggests a
counterintuitive conclusion—the less technology entrepreneurs know about ways to serve a
market, the greater their chances of using technology knowledge to create breakthrough
innovations within it. Finally, we discuss configurations of human capital that are likely to
bestow unique advantages in the construction of radical innovations.

Introduction
Innovation is of central importance to entrepreneurship (Covin & Miles, 1999;
Schumpeter, 1942) and of immense interest, given that it is the primary instrument of
competition for many firms (Baumol, 2002). Arguably, the most common way of defining
innovation involves using an incremental versus radical framework. Pavitt (1991)
describes radical innovations as revolutionary or discontinuous changes, while incremental innovations are conventional or simple extensions in a line of historical improvements.
In economic terms, the impact of radical innovation is considerably more dramatic. They
can transform existing markets, create new ones, and make an enormous economic
contribution (Leifer et al., 2000). Although radical innovation outcomes have been
empirically linked to entrepreneurship at a macro level (e.g., Baumol, 2002), how this is
accomplished at a micro level of analysis is poorly understood.
Understanding how individuals create breakthrough innovations has rich theoretical
and practical implications for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship, as a scholarly field,
seeks to understand how, by whom, and with what effects opportunities to create future

number of studies provide evidence that aspects of an individual’s human capital facilitate
the recognition or development of an opportunity (Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Shane,
2000; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005). Human capital theory posits that individuals with
more or higher quality human capital will reap more desirable outcomes (Becker, 1964).
However, the question of how human capital contributes to the process of enacting radical
innovation has eluded most scholars. This research endeavors to fill that void by investigating how aspects of individual human capital are linked to the recognition of opportunities bearing radical innovation outcomes.
To investigate human capital and its relationship to radical innovation, we draw on
prior entrepreneurship research that examines both general and specific human capital
(e.g., Corbett, 2007; Dimov & Shepherd, 2005). In doing so, this article makes a number
of contributions. First, we increase our understanding of the characteristics of technology
entrepreneurs by examining three types of general human capital that are associated with
innovation radicalness—experience depth, experience breadth, and formal education.
Second, we examine specific human capital by investigating technology entrepreneurs’
prior knowledge. We demonstrate how differences in prior knowledge of markets,
customer problems, ways to serve markets, and technology at opportunity recognition
systematically influence the radicalness of subsequent products and services.
We then explore which combinations of general and specific human capital are
associated with radical innovation. By examining the configurations of technology entrepreneurs’ human capital associated with high innovation versus low innovation, we hope
to increase understanding about which characteristics are associated with radicalness.
Further, we believe that differences in prior knowledge at opportunity recognition form
knowledge configurations or gestalts that bestow unique advantages. Such configurations
provide a more holistic picture of the factors that influence opportunity recognition. By
examining knowledge configurations, we can see which elements of prior knowledge are
most likely to be associated with radical innovation and learn how multivariate combinations of human capital can be used to understand the subsequent outcomes of technology
entrepreneurs.
To summarize, this study investigates the types of general and specific human capital
that are associated with radical innovation outcomes and how configurations of human
capital might be linked to higher levels of innovation radicalness. The paper unfolds along
the following lines. In the next section, we briefly review literature surrounding innovation
outcomes and the entrepreneur. We then present a theoretical argument for why aspects of
individual human capital will influence differences in innovation outcomes. Hypotheses
related to general and specific human capital and its effects on innovation radicalness
are proposed. We then report the methods and results of our empirical examination. A
discussion follows and the paper concludes with implications for research and practice.

The Entrepreneur and the Radical Innovation Advantage
Entrepreneurial ventures and small businesses contribute about two and a half times
more innovations per employee than do large firms (Acs & Audretsch, 2003) and are
responsible for the bulk of radical innovations in the economy (Baumol, 2002, 2006).
Radical innovation lies at the core of new business development and long-term wealth
creation (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001; Kirchhoff, 1991). Despite the fact that large firms have
the competencies to manage the development of new offerings, they languish in terms
of emergent technology ventures and their ability to create innovation breakthroughs.
808

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->Utterback (1994) and Christensen (2000), among others, have noted how firms that
dominate one generation of technology often fail to maintain leadership in the next because
they have turned their attention to incremental improvements and, as a consequence,
diminished their capacity to create truly new breakthroughs (Benner & Tushman, 2002;
Leifer et al., 2000).Yet radical or breakthrough innovations are chief among the competitive
weapons that enable firms to launch entrepreneurial ventures. Although large businesses
account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. expenditure on research and development,
independent entrepreneurs are more likely to account for the most fundamentally novel
innovations (Baumol, 2006). Most revolutionary new business ideas, it can be argued, have
been, and are likely to continue to be provided by the independent entrepreneur.
What gives individual entrepreneurs a radical innovation advantage? One explanation
may be that opportunities to create radical innovation depend more on individual knowledge and initiative than on organizational processes. Baumol (2006) showed that among
the most radical innovations within the last two centuries, the majority have emerged from
individual entrepreneurs. Similarly, in a study of 12 radical innovation projects in large
established firms, it was an individual scientist or an engineer who discovered the critical
breakthrough in each case (O’Connor & Rice, 2001). Although we cannot assume the
process of creating radical innovation is the same within large organizations as it is within
the start-up context, the extant research suggests there is much to learn from the independent technology entrepreneur.
We believe it is the human capital attributes of technology entrepreneurs that enable
them to generate the breakthrough insights that lead to radical innovations. Becker
(1964) identified knowledge and experience as the major components of human capital.
Technology entrepreneurs are individuals who recognize and exploit opportunities by
leveraging technology knowledge and experience to create new value through the venture
creation process. To shed light on how radical innovations are created, we use the lens of
human capital theory to set forth a model of general and specific human capital and its
effects on innovation radicalness.

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development
The objective of this section is to review the literature and derive hypotheses that link
aspects of technology entrepreneurs’ human capital to the radicalness of their innovations.
First, human capital theory is discussed as well as why such theory is of use in enhancing
our understanding of how some individuals recognize opportunities to innovate. Wellknown aspects of general human capital are reviewed and hypotheses are put forward. We
then discuss specific types of knowledge shown to influence opportunity recognition and
provide hypotheses specific to the prior knowledge framework used to examine technology entrepreneurs’ specific human capital.

Human Capital and the Entrepreneur
Two key characteristics, knowledge and experience, underlie the concept of human
capital (Becker, 1964). Although prior research has examined how human factors such as
the behavioral propensities (e.g., Mosakowski, 1998) and personality traits (e.g., Zhao &
Seibert, 2006) of individual entrepreneurs affect entrepreneurial outcomes, little is known
about the role of human capital in entrepreneurship. Becker (1964) developed the theory
of human capital by extending microeconomics to a wide range of human behavior. He
November, 2007

809

<-----Page 3----->popularized the idea of education and training as investments, similar to a firm’s purchase
of new equipment. In general, his theory contends that individuals with more or higher
quality human capital will achieve more desirable outcomes. Therefore, in the present
context, increased human capital improves the likelihood of opportunity recognition and
persons with superior human capital will perceive a greater variety of opportunities than
others. Consequently, those who perceive a greater variety of opportunities are likely to
select a more radical opportunity from the opportunity set.
Recognizing opportunities is a vitally important aspect of entrepreneurship and is
strongly linked to individual characteristics as suggested by Bygrave and Hofer (1991),
who defined an entrepreneur as one who “perceives an opportunity and creates an
organization to pursue it” (p. 14). Human capital has received accelerating attention in
opportunity research, although much of the research has examined knowledge exclusively
(e.g., Shane, 2000; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005; Thorpe, Holt, Macpherson, & Pittaway,
2005). Knowledge influences the entrepreneur’s ability to comprehend, extrapolate,
interpret, and apply new information (Roberts, 1991). An individual’s unique possession
of prior knowledge creates a knowledge corridor that allows him or her to identify certain
opportunities but not others (Ronstadt, 1988). In general, entrepreneurs will discover only
those opportunities directly related to their knowledge (Venkataraman, 1997). Because
knowledge is generated through an individual’s unique life experiences, each person’s
accumulation of human capital is different. We posit that differences in general and
specific human capital facilitate the discovery of opportunities bearing different outcomes.
General Human Capital: Education and Experience. Education and experience are
characteristics that are central to the concept of human capital (Becker, 1964). Experience
encompasses work experience and other practical learning that takes place on the job, as
well as nonformal education such as training. Both depth of work experience and broad
experience across markets are theorized to increase human capital (Becker, 1964).
Research shows labor market experience, management experience, and previous
entrepreneurial experiences are significantly related to venturing activities and positive
outcomes (Bates, 1990; Gimeno, Folta, Cooper, & Woo, 1997; Robinson & Sexton, 1994).
Fiet (1995) observed that previous work experiences set the context within which an
entrepreneur decides whether to invest in a particular venture; in effect, accumulated
experience increases alertness by providing more cues about when to take action. Vesper
(1980), Case (1989), and Bhide (2000) all concluded that the greatest number of start-up
ideas come from previous employment. Shane (2003) indicated that business experience,
functional experience, and industry experience are all useful for the discovery and exploitation of opportunities. Through work experience, people develop information and skills
that facilitate the formulation of entrepreneurial strategy, the acquisition of resources, and
the process of organizing. Experience increases a person’s human capital and reduces
uncertainty about the value of opportunities.
Breadth in work experience provides access to new information that facilitates opportunity recognition. Recognizing opportunities is often like solving puzzles because a new
piece of information is often the missing element necessary to provide meaning or trigger
an entrepreneurial conjecture (Shane, 2003). The more diverse a person’s experiences,
the greater number of puzzle pieces they can draw upon (Casson, 1995). People often
learn about entrepreneurial opportunities through participation in markets (Casson, 1982).
Further, variation in market experience provides access to different types of information
that may be useful in the discovery process. Therefore, participation in more markets
should increase the likelihood that a person will gain access to the information that is
needed for opportunity recognition.
810

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Delmar and Davidsson (2000) compared people who were in the process of starting
a business with a randomly selected control group not starting a business and found that
those in the process of venture-starting were more mobile across markets than the control
group. Using a longitudinal survey, Evans and Leighton (1989) found the probability of
being self-employed was higher the more job changes a person had. A number of studies
have shown that the number of jobs a person has had positively influences the likelihood
of self-employment (e.g., Blanchflower & Oswald, 1998; Dolton & Makepeace, 1990).
Experience breadth, therefore, may be a key element of human capital among entrepreneurial founders.
Education is another aspect of a person’s human capital that may be valuable in the
discovery and exploitation of opportunities. Education increases a person’s stock of
information and skills, including those needed to recognize and pursue an entrepreneurial
opportunity successfully. Baum, Locke, and Smith (2001) examined the performance of
Canadian biotechnology firms and showed founders with master’s degrees or higher had
faster employment and revenue growth than others in the sample. Numerous studies
examining human capital have accepted the notion that “more is better” and used formal
education or years of schooling as a measure of human capital (e.g., Bruderl, Preisendorfer, & Ziegler, 1992; Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon, & Woo, 1994; Gimeno et al., 1997).
However, the findings for a positive association between education and venture creation
(Bates, 1990; Evans & Leighton, 1989), as well as between education and the discovery
and exploitation of opportunities (Davidsson & Honig, 2003), have been mixed. Dimov
and Shepherd (2005) suggest that a possible explanation for these mixed results is that
broad measures have insufficient sensitivity to capture the impact that human capital may
have on differing entrepreneurial outcomes.
To summarize, technology entrepreneurs who have greater depth and breadth of
professional experience, as well as higher formal education, will have a greater ability to
identify opportunities with radical outcomes. Therefore:
Hypothesis 1a: Technology entrepreneurs’ experience depth is positively related to
innovation radicalness.
Hypothesis 1b: Technology entrepreneurs’ experience breadth is positively related
to innovation radicalness.
Hypothesis 1c: Technology entrepreneurs’ formal education is positively related to
innovation radicalness.
Specific Human Capital: Types of Knowledge. Scholars have begun the laborious task of
investigating specific types of knowledge, or human capital, and their influence on opportunity recognition and venture creation. Christensen and Peterson (1990) conducted one
of the earliest empirical studies of knowledge and opportunity recognition. Their research
stressed the importance of technology and market knowledge as prerequisites for
recognizing opportunities. Christensen and Peterson viewed opportunity recognition as a
problem-solving process that calls on both kinds of knowledge. Their research suggests
that technology and market knowledge allows for individuals to identify both problems
and potential opportunities to solve problems with technology. Numerous other research
studies from the new product development literature emphasize the role of specific and
divergent knowledge types in recognizing and developing opportunities (e.g., Iansiti,
1993; Leonard & Sensiper, 1998; O’Connor & Veryzer, 2001).
Amabile (1999) stressed combining market knowledge and technology knowledge as
advantageous for developing new ideas. She argued an individual’s creativity is enhanced
November, 2007

811

<-----Page 5----->if his or her cognitive style facilitates the ability to link divergent knowledge types. The
group dynamics of different ideas coming together and undergoing constructive criticism
to develop new products is often referred to as creative abrasion (Leonard & Sensiper,
1998; Leonard & Straus, 1997). This process is enhanced when individuals within the
group provide different types of knowledge (Amabile, 1999; Leonard & Sensiper;
O’Conner & Veryzer, 2001). Shane (2000 demonstrated, in a landmark embedded case
study examining technology entrepreneurs exposed to an MIT invention, that major
dimensions of prior knowledge were required and combined with technology knowledge
to facilitate opportunity recognition. These include prior knowledge of ways to serve
markets, prior knowledge of customer problems, and prior knowledge of markets.
Prior knowledge of how to serve markets entails how technologies can be packaged to
meet the needs of a particular market. Aldrich and Wiedenmayer (1993) demonstrated the
product or service lines entrepreneurs establish are related to the organizational units for
which they previously worked. For example, Shane (2000) demonstrated an entrepreneur
who had experience in machine design would package the potentially profitable technology via a machine rather than a service. Further, another entrepreneur could only discover
the service market because of a lack of knowledge in the areas of machine design and
manufacturing. In another situation, a company founder had prior knowledge of how to
serve a market that required the product to be packaged in a way that would meet
government approval. Because of the entrepreneur’s pharmaceutical experience, he knew
how to package the technology using different materials into a machine meeting Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Shane, 2000).
Prior knowledge of customer problems involves information about customer needs.
The locus of innovation often lies with the users because they cannot easily articulate their
needs for undeveloped solutions (Von Hippel, 1988). An accurate understanding of user
needs has been shown to be essential to successful new products. When individuals lack
familiarity with customer problems, it is difficult to identify solutions to those problems
when they are presented (Roberts, 1991). Thus, the process leads entrepreneurs to engage
in start-ups to solve customer problems they learned about in their experiences (Von
Hippel). For example, Shane (2000) found an entrepreneur’s experience working with
clinical pharmacology customer problems allowed him to see how a technology could be
used to treat hypertension. Von Hippel (1986) encouraged learning from lead users as an
excellent source of novel products. Lead users of products and services face needs that are
common to a marketplace—but face them months or years in advance of most market
participants. Since these users are aware of future problems before other users, potential
entrepreneurial opportunities may be perceived that are less obvious to the general
population.
Prior knowledge of markets involves information about how particular markets
operate. Von Hippel (1988) indicated that prior knowledge of markets may include
information about relationships with suppliers and customers, sales techniques, and
capital requirements, which are likely different across markets. Possession of prior industrial knowledge about how a product or a technology influences a particular market can
enable one to identify an entrepreneurial opportunity (Roberts, 1991). Market knowledge
is not likely to be publicly known but can be acquired by having worked in a particular
market as a manufacturer, customer, employee, or supplier (Shane, 2000). For example,
Shane demonstrated that in all eight of his examined opportunities, the entrepreneurs had
previous experience in the market that allowed them to see a new business application for
a given technology.
In Shane’s (2000) study of prior knowledge and opportunity recognition, the technology entrepreneurs he examined had knowledge of ways to serve markets, customer
812

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->problems, and markets, which were combined—or mixed—with new knowledge of technology resulting in their opportunity. That is, the identified prior knowledge types were
antecedents to the technology. An alternative approach involves beginning with a novel
technology that is suspected to have value and then search for an application. By taking
the view that opportunities may be developed (e.g., Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; De
Koning, 2003), an individual may begin with technology knowledge and add other types
of knowledge to facilitate the process. Recognizing opportunities is a learning process
(e.g., Corbett, 2007; Lumpkin & Lichtenstein, 2005) and knowledge types represent
building blocks that vary in the construction of an entrepreneurial opportunity. Therefore,
if one views opportunity recognition as a knowledge-based process, it will begin with a
mix of prior knowledge types and call on additional knowledge to facilitate the process.
These prior knowledge types include: (1) ways to serve markets, (2) customer problem,
(3) markets, and (4) technology. Given these knowledge types are conducive and necessary to recognize opportunities, a person who has more or higher quality will be aware
of a greater variety of opportunities. Therefore, those who perceive a greater variety of
opportunities are better able to select and exploit opportunities bearing more radical
outcomes. This logic leads to the following four hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2a: Technology entrepreneurs’ prior knowledge of ways to serve
markets is positively related to innovation radicalness.
Hypothesis 2b: Technology entrepreneurs’ prior knowledge of customer problems is
positively related to innovation radicalness.
Hypothesis 2c: Technology entrepreneurs’ prior knowledge of markets is positively
related to innovation radicalness.
Hypothesis 2d: Technology entrepreneurs’ prior knowledge of technology is positively related to innovation radicalness.
Configurations of General and Specific Human Capital. As the previous discussion
suggests, different types of human capital are likely to influence opportunity recognition
processes. Studies of both the individual-level (e.g., Zhao & Seibert, 2006) and firmlevel (Miller, 1988) phenomena indicate that multivariate combinations of factors are
often needed to accurately account for entrepreneurial outcomes. Thus, configurations
of human capital attributes may provide the best predictors of innovation radicalness. In
terms of general human capital, for example, higher levels of formal education have
been associated with greater open-mindedness and receptivity to innovation (Kimberly
& Evanisko, 1981). For many types of entrepreneurial founders, greater experience is
associated with higher levels of success (Singer, 1995). Combinations of high experience and education would therefore seem favorable for radical innovation. But greater
experience has also been found to limit strategic flexibility (Hitt & Barr, 1989), which
may inhibit innovation radicalness. Bhide (2000) suggests that, in general, very high
levels of human capital limit the propensity of entrepreneurs to take risks on innovative
new ventures.
To address these contrasting conclusions, this study asks what configurations of
general and specific human capital are associated with radical innovation. Rather than
propose specific configurations, however, our aim in this part of the analysis is explore
which human capital attributes are most likely to be associated with innovation radicalness. In the next section, therefore, we extend what has been a partial understanding of
human capital and investigate how differences in general and specific human capital are
related to different innovation outcomes. Then, we conduct supplementary analysis to

Methods
Sample
To identify founders of technology ventures who recently started a venture, technology incubators were targeted. An incubator is a facility designed to encourage
entrepreneurship and minimize obstacles for new venture formation and growth by
housing a number of fledgling enterprises that share an array of services. A list of
incubators in the central United States was obtained from the National Business Incubation Association online database. Incubators were selected based on proximity to a large
Midwest university and the number of technology ventures housed there. All of the
incubators enlisted were affiliated with universities although not necessarily universityowned. In total, 13 incubators took part in the study, which resulted in individual meetings
with founders during which the survey was completed. The sample consisted of 145
technology entrepreneurs throughout the Midwest. Of the respondents, 92% were male
and 8% female. The average number of years of professional work experience was about
20 years and the average number of different employers worked for was approximately
four. Among the respondents, 40% were PhDs, followed by about 33% who held a
bachelor’s degree and 26% who possessed a master’s degree. About 3% held an associate’s degree and fewer than 2% had only a high school education.

Survey Instrument
The survey used in this study included two experience items, an education item, 20
prior knowledge items, and 10 items concerning the innovativeness of technology entrepreneurs’ products or services. The items used to examine entrepreneurs’ prior knowledge
at opportunity recognition were developed from the constructive prior knowledge
framework and addressed the amount and importance of prior knowledge at opportunity
recognition. Items addressing characteristics of the venture and other founder demographics were also included.

Scale Development and Content Validity
For the purposes of the study, four prior knowledge scales and an innovation scale
were developed. In both cases, deductive scale development was employed. Deductive
scale analysis requires an understanding of the phenomenon being investigated and a
thorough review of the literature to tap the construct of interest (Hinkin, 1995). Degree of
radicalness is often used to classify innovations according to how radical they are
compared with existing products or services (Freeman & Soete, 1997; Hage, 1980). This
way of differentiating between radical and incremental innovation is useful for defining a
continuum of innovation types and, therefore, a group of items was also derived to assess
the radicalness of products and services using Hage’s (1980) and Leifer et al.’s (2000)
work distinguishing among incremental and radical innovation.
Researchers derived a group of items for the prior knowledge constructs using the
reviewed literature and quotes from the entrepreneurs in Shane’s (2000) embedded case
study.
814

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->After the generation of items, the prior knowledge items were then subjected to a
content validity assessment by eight faculty members and doctoral students who were
asked to classify each item to one of five categories, which included the four prior
knowledge dimensions plus an other category. Those items that were assigned to the
intended category more than 85% of the time were included in the survey instrument.
Experts in scale development from a Research 1 University’s Survey Research Laboratory
were consulted throughout construction of the items and scales.

Pilot Testing
A pilot study (n = 15) was conducted using technology entrepreneurs affiliated with a
large Midwestern university. The pilot was used to identify any unclear items, problematic
directions, the length of time required to complete the survey, and to determine a workable
data collection protocol. No problematic items or instructions were found and the average
length of time to complete the survey was approximately 20 minutes.

Data Collection Procedures
Incubator managers were identified using the incubator’s representative website and
were contacted by phone. The manager was provided with an overview of the research
initiative and asked to provide contact information of founders of technology-based
ventures that were approximately 5 years old or younger. In all cases, the manager
provided names and contact information of founders of technology-based ventures at their
site. The identified entrepreneurs were contacted and asked to participate in a research
project funded by the Kauffman Foundation and the sponsoring university. The entrepreneur was informed the results of the study may be used to improve entrepreneurship
education. The entrepreneur was questioned to assure they were the individuals responsible for the venture idea. If they were not responsible for the venture idea they were not
asked to continue. If the contact was the person responsible for the venture idea, a
30-minute meeting was requested. Of the entrepreneurs contacted, only one elected not
to participate and approximately 10 were unable to meet with the researcher because
of prearranged travel plans. In exchange for their participation, the entrepreneur was
presented with a book in appreciation for their time in completing the survey. The
entrepreneur was also asked to pay close attention to the delineation of time in the survey
as it contained items about their prior knowledge when they first perceived their opportunity, followed by items that concern the present.

Measures
General Human Capital Independent Variables. To assess general human capital, three
items were used to determine the experience and education of the technology entrepreneurs. Breadth of experience was measured using an item that questioned the number of
employers the entrepreneur had worked for. To measure the depth of experience, the
number of years of professional work experience was requested. The education item used
an ordinal scale and requested the respondents’ highest level of education. The scale
included high school, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and PhD.
Construction of the Specific Human Capital Independent Variables. There were initially five items for each prior knowledge type specific to the time the opportunity was first

recognized. Following each item, two Likert-type response scales were included, one that
addressed the amount of prior knowledge and a second that inquired about its importance
to perceiving the opportunity. The amount response scale used a 5-point Likert-type scale
and the importance response scale used a 3-point Likert-type scale. Opportunity recognition was assumed to be a function of both a person’s stock of knowledge (Ronstadt,
1988; Shane, 2000) and a person’s alertness (Kirzner, 1973) to that knowledge. The
amount (A) and importance (I) response scores were weighted by multiplying the two
scores for each item together. The weighted scores for each prior knowledge type were
then summed and resulted in a prior knowledge variable score (P).

Table 1 includes the mean scores for the amount of prior knowledge, the importance

ways to serve markets, customer problems, and markets. The respondents scored the
importance of their prior knowledge to recognize the opportunity as customers problems
the highest followed by ways to serve markets, technology, and markets. Of the four
prior knowledge variables, technology knowledge at opportunity recognition scored the
highest, followed by ways to serve markets, customer problems, and markets.
Prior Knowledge Scales. Prior knowledge items made up scales that were used to assess
prior knowledge of (1) ways to serve markets, (2) customer problems, (3) markets, and (4)
technology. A principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed
to determine factor loadings (Table 2). Four of the five items for each prior knowledge
type achieved a factor loading of .40 or greater and were thus considered to measure the
construct of interest and retained as recommended by Hinkin (1995). The prior knowledge
response scales of both amount and importance used to comprise the prior knowledge
variables were found to be reliable overall, as each obtained alpha coefficients of between
.68 and .89. Coefficient alpha assesses how well the set of items measures a single
unidimensional construct.

Construction of the Innovation Dependent Variable. The dependent variable was an
innovation score initially based on a 10-item scale. The 10 items used a 4-point Likerttype level of agreement response scale to determine the radicalness of the product or
service. A 4-point response scale was used, as even-numbered scales can more effectively
discriminate between agreement or disagreement because there is no neutral option
(Dillman, 2000). The scale used a progressive hierarchy where higher scores indicated
products or services more radical in nature while a lower score indicated incremental or
feature improvements. Several of the items were worded in such a way as to warrant
reverse coding and used to prevent patterned responses.
Innovation Scale. A principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation was
performed to determine factor loadings. Seven of the 10 items achieved a factor loading
of .40 or greater and were thus considered to measure the construct of interest (Hinkin,
November, 2007

1995). The resulting 7-item scale was found to be reliable with a resulting coefficient
alpha of .71. The responses to the retained seven items were used to create the innovation
dependent variable (see Table 3).
Control Variable. A number of studies have indicated differences between the age of a
venture and outcomes. For example, Quinn and Cameron (1983) showed criteria for
effectiveness change as new organizations develop. Utterback (1994) indicated the extent
of innovation exercised was also, in part, a function of age. The regression performed
employed a single control variable—age of venture. The control variable was created by
calculating the number of months between venture launch and the date the survey was
completed.

Results
Nine variables were used within the study and included three general human capital
variables, four specific human capital variables, an innovation variable, and a single
control variable. The general human capital variables included (1) depth of experience, (2)
breadth of experience (number of employers worked for), and (3) formal education or
degree. The specific human capital measures were prior knowledge variables that included
(1) ways to serve markets, (2) customer problems, (3) markets, and (4) technology.
Table 4 provides descriptive statistics and correlations across the variables.
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine the human capital variables
most strongly associated with the innovation variable (Table 5). The analysis used three
models comprising the control variable, the set of general human capital variables, and the
set of specific human capital variables. The base model (Model 1) included only the effect
of the control variable (i.e., age of venture) and explained minimal variance (R2 = .01). To
assess general human capital, depth of experience, breadth of experience, and formal
education were introduced as a step change in Model 2. The set of general human capital
variables explained a statistically significant portion of variance in the innovation variable
(R2 = .11; p < .01). The set of specific human capital variables comprising prior knowledge types was introduced as a step change in Model 3 and explained a significant portion
of variance over Model 2 (R2 = .08; p < .05). Therefore, the general and specific human
capital variable sets collectively explain a statistically significant portion of variance
(R2 = .20; p < .01).

The full model reveals that of the general human capital variables, formal education
was statistically significant (p < .01) and depth of experience was marginally significant
(p = .09). The breadth of experience variable was not significant in the variance explained.
Of note, all the general human capital variables exhibited positive betas in relationship to
innovation radicalness, although the experience breadth variable was negligible. Therefore, of the general human capital hypotheses, hypothesis 1a is partially supported and
hypothesis 1c was supported. Hypothesis 1b is not supported.

<-----Page 13----->The full model shows that of the specific human capital variables, prior knowledge of
technology was statistically significant (p < .01), as well as prior knowledge of ways to
serve markets (p < .05). However, contrary to hypothesis 2a, the standardized beta coefficient indicated a negative correlation between prior knowledge of ways to serve markets
and innovation radicalness; prior knowledge of technology was in the hypothesized
direction. Neither the prior knowledge of customer problems nor the prior knowledge of
markets variables explained significant portions of variance, although interestingly, prior
knowledge of customer problems also had a negative beta. Hence, of the specific human
capital hypotheses, only hypothesis 2d was supported.

Supplementary Analysis
To explore how differences in human capital translate to different innovation outcomes, a configuration analysis was developed. These emergent configurations represent
the relative arrangements of human capital that resulted in incremental versus radical
innovation. To construct configurations for incremental versus radical innovation, the
innovation variable was used to create two groups of cases which included a high group
(n = 22) typifying radical innovation that scored 1 standard deviation (SD) above the
innovation variable mean and a low group (n = 22) typifying incremental innovation that
scored 1 SD below the innovation variable mean. Human capital variables were plotted
along the x-axis, mean scores were plotted along the y-axis, and high and low innovation
lines were displayed within the plot area. The general human capital variable scores were
first standardized and then the variable means were plotted for high and low innovation as
seen in Figure 1. The specific human capital configurations appear in Figure 2.
The general and specific human capital configurations appear overall consistent with
the hierarchical regression results. However, the patterns reveal the relative arrangements
of human capital types for differing innovation outcomes. For the general human capital
configurations, the greatest difference between the innovation groups was among formal
education and depth of experience—both of which were positively associated with innovation radicalness. The specific human capital configuration showed that prior technology
knowledge alone was greater for more radical innovation outcomes. While the two
configurations showed a similar pattern, the greatest difference among the two groups was
prior knowledge of technology and ways to serve markets. Prior knowledge of ways to
serve markets was considerably less for those technology entrepreneurs who created more
radical products or services.

Discussion
The purpose of this study has been to investigate how the human capital of technology
entrepreneurs relates to innovation radicalness. Overall, the results support previous
research that highlighted the importance of individual differences in human capital and
opportunity recognition (Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Ronstadt, 1988; Shane, 2000;
Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005). The current study provides evidence that aspects of both
general and specific human capital are vital to explaining radical innovation. Consistent
with Becker (1964), general human capital was positively correlated with a highly desirable outcome—breakthrough innovation. Formal education and experience depth were
positively and significantly associated with radical innovation, although formal education
was more significantly related. These findings suggest that education level and deep

knowledge based on years of experience are more important for creating breakthrough
innovation than broad experience across multiple areas.
For specific human capital, the findings underscore the vitality of prior technology
knowledge at opportunity recognition to create radical innovation. However, the results
are somewhat inconsistent with human capital theory and bring an interesting finding to
light. Becker’s (1964) theory contends that individuals with more or higher quality human
capital will reap more desirable outcomes. Instead, the current study strongly suggests that
it may be more favorable to possess less of particular types of knowledge to achieve
breakthrough innovations—which represent highly desirable outcomes. Prior knowledge
of ways to serve markets and technology knowledge were the best predictors of innovation. However, the results are curiously counterintuitive—while technology knowledge
was positively correlated with innovation radicalness, knowledge of ways to serve markets
was negatively correlated. This suggests that knowing less about ways to develop and
package a future product or service at discovery may be advantageous for creating
frame-breaking innovations. Individuals who know less about customer problems and
lack knowledge of ways to serve them, yet have heightened technology knowledge at
discovery, appear best positioned to create breakthrough innovations.
Interestingly, the specific human capital knowledge configuration (Figure 2) reveals
that, of the different knowledge types at opportunity recognition, only technology knowledge was greater for those entrepreneurs who created radical innovations. The knowledge
configuration and the negatively correlated betas of prior knowledge of ways to serve

markets and prior knowledge of customer problems provide evidence that these knowledge types may stifle creativity and recognizing more radical opportunities. These findings concur with Bhide’s (2000) assertion that too much human capital can limit the
propensity of entrepreneurs to pursue more risky ventures. An explanation may be that
overfamiliarity with customers, markets, and development standards constrain recognition or exploitation of opportunities with breakthrough potential. High knowledge of
development standards and market practices may lead to preconceived notions of the
possibilities and limit the opportunities considered and developed. Considerable knowledge of the accepted standards and behaviors of customers may precondition a person to
dismiss potential opportunities with radical outcomes and therefore severely limit his or
her opportunity set. A person who is not conditioned to the accepted norms of customers,
markets, and common development processes, but who has rich technology knowledge,
may be best positioned to recognize, develop, and exploit opportunities with breakthrough
potential.
Our study suggests that the reasons why entrepreneurs have had, and will likely
continue to have, a radical innovation advantage include (1) their rich technology
knowledge, and (2) their ability to act creatively without being constrained by current
customers and norms of existing products or services. Based on this, it is reasonable to
conclude that the “Achilles heel” of the large firm may be a myopic view of existing
customers and market norms. Christensen (2000) showed how firms that dominate a
market often fall prey to new ventures that use new or existing technologies in dramatically different ways—even though they listened to their customers. Therefore, an
opportunity that results from technology knowledge suspected to have value and
822

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->learning about potential demand side applications seems most indicative of the process
of creating breakthrough innovation.
Taken together, the evidence suggests that individuals with greater depth of experience and higher levels of education are better suited for recognizing opportunities with
highly desired innovation outcomes. Heightened knowledge of technology is also imperative to recognizing breakthrough innovations. The prior knowledge constructs identified
by Shane (2000)—ways to serve markets, customer problems, and markets—were relatively less likely to be associated with innovation radicalness. Therefore, technology
knowledge is a prerequisite for recognizing opportunities with radical innovation
outcomes and should be included in future knowledge frameworks in the context of
technology entrepreneurship.

Limitations
There are several methodological limitations that should be taken into account when
interpreting the results. First, a purposive sample of technology entrepreneurs whose
venture was housed in incubators within the Midwest was used rather than a completely
random sample. Therefore, the results may not generalize to technology entrepreneurs
operating without the support of an incubator or operating in incubators outside of the
Midwest or other countries. Some biases may also exist in those who select to be housed
in an incubator or in the selection of incubation candidates. Second, the study called for
entrepreneurs to recall broad aspects of their knowledge at a point in time in the past.
People’s ability to recall the past is limited, but keeping recall simple and relating recall
to major life events helps produce higher quality survey data (Dillman, 2000; Huber &
Power, 1985). We believe the events the technology entrepreneurs were asked to recall
likely constituted major life events (i.e., recognizing the opportunity for their future
venture); nevertheless, it is a potential limitation of the study. Third, the study employed
subjective measures to assess the radicalness of technology entrepreneurs’ product or
service. That is, technology entrepreneurs rated aspects of their own venture’s offering,
which they may have scored as more innovative than they actually were. However, prior
research indicates that objective and subjective assessments tend to correlate significantly
and therefore subjective measures can be reliably used when objective measures are not
available (Dess & Robinson, 1984). Further, Jennings and Young (1990) compared subjective and objective measures of product innovation and found no significant difference
between the measures. Lastly, the measures employed to examine depth and breadth of
experience were broad approximations and may insufficiently account for these important
aspects of human capital. Future measures may better enhance understanding of these
important dimensions of experience and their affect on outcomes.

Future Research
Our study provides evidence that both general and specific human capital are useful
for understanding the radicalness of technology entrepreneurs’ products or services.
While innovation, and particularly radical innovation, is a suitable dependent variable
(Baumol, 2002; Fiet, 2002; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005), future research should consider
other entrepreneurial outcome variables to better understand the role of human capital.
Another promising area of entrepreneurship research relates to learning outcomes of
opportunity recognition (e.g., Van Gelderen, Van Der Sluis, & Jansen, 2005) and how
different types of human capital enhance learning. For example, the current study raises
November, 2007

823

<-----Page 17----->questions about the role of human capital subsequent to opportunity recognition. What
knowledge is acquired between the time an opportunity is recognized and a venture is
launched and how do these differences impact the founding and early growth of a new
venture? Further, how do the knowledge configurations of technology entrepreneurs
change, if at all, as the venture matures? Answering such questions may enhance our
understanding of how learning influences venture creation and generates desirable venture
outcomes.
While the focus of our undertaking was to examine the effects of human capital on
innovation radicalness, the findings lead us to question if it is possible that innovation can
be too radical? By too radical, we mean a product or service too far ahead of its time to
gain initial sales and penetrate markets. It is suspected a relationship may exist between
innovation radicalness and sales in the shape of an inverted ᐁ. Although we lack the data
to accurately resolve this question, we encourage future studies to address the seemingly
contentious relationship among radicalness and market acceptance—or sales.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study contributed to one of the most important questions facing
entrepreneurship research today, namely, why some people, and not others, recognize
opportunities, and with what effect (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). The study responded
directly to this fundamental, yet unresolved, question. The findings underscore the importance of both general and specific human capital and demonstrated how the characteristics
and knowledge configurations of technology entrepreneurs are associated with differences
in innovation outcomes.
