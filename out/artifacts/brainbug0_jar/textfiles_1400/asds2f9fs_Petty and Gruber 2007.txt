Abstract
This paper offers several novel insights on the Venture Capital (VC) decision making process
by investigating the criteria used to reject deals (as opposed to the commonly studied acceptance
criteria), and the dynamics of the VC decision-making process over the lifecycle of a fund. The
qualitative analysis is based on a comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11 years of
archival data from a European-based VC firm. During this time, the VC managed two funds, reviewed a total of 3,631 deals, and made 35 investments. Implications of our results for research

ABSTRACT
This paper offers several novel insights on the Venture Capital (VC) decision making process by
investigating the criteria used to reject deals (as opposed to the commonly studied acceptance
criteria), and the dynamics of the VC decision-making process over the lifecycle of a fund. The
qualitative analysis is based on a comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11 years of
archival data from a European-based VC firm. During this time, the VC managed two funds,
reviewed a total of 3,631 deals, and made 35 investments. Implications of our results for research
and practice are outlined.
INTRODUCTION
Each year thousands of entrepreneurs submit their business proposals to VCs in the hope that
they will receive the desired capital and access to a network that many believe will enable them to
realize their commercial and financial objectives in new business creation. Given that VCs are
highly selective in their funding decisions, it is not surprising that a fairly large number of studies
seek to further our understanding of the main criteria that influence the VC investment decision
(e.g., Wells, 1974; MacMillan et al. 1985, 1987; Hisrich and Jankowicz, 1990; Shepherd, 1999;
Franke et al., 2008). These studies indicate that in their selection of deals, VCs emphasize various
criteria such as the market growth and size, the innovativeness and competitive insulation of the
product offering, and the expected rate of return of the venture project (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1981;
MacMillan et al., 1985). Research has also consistently shown that amongst the set of evaluation
criteria, VCs tend to place the highest importance on criteria related to the management team (e.g.,
Wells, 1974; Zopounidis, 1994; Muzyka et al., 1996; Shepherd, 1999).
Yet, despite the progress that has been made in understanding VC decision making, a close
examination of the extant literature reveals that prior studies have been curiously one-sided, as
they focus on the criteria VCs apply when accepting deals and not when rejecting deal proposals.
Given the complexity and uncertainty inherent in VC decision making and the lack of prior
empirical evidence, it would be premature to assume that the criteria used to accept proposals, or
significance of the same, will correspond to those criteria that VCs use to disqualify or reject a
deal. Arguably, the emphasis on acceptance criteria has been encouraged by researchers’ strong
interest in better understanding the success of new ventures and not their failure, and also a lack of
data on failed venture deals in VC decision making (Barry, 1994). However, when considering
that about 97-99% of all submitted business proposals will get rejected by a VC (Hall, 1989), it is
quite dissatisfying that we possess hardly any knowledge on deal rejection criteria.

However, there is yet another major shortcoming in extant research, as studies investigating
VC decision-making criteria tend to be agnostic to firm-specific factors which are likely to
influence the decision-making process and criteria over the lifetime of a VC fund. For example,
VCs may have less time to engage in deal selection in later lifecycle stages of their fund, as they
will spend more time on monitoring and assisting portfolio firms (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).
Once again, this lack of research incorporating firm-specific factors may be, in part, due to limited
availability of data, but is also the result of the cross sectional nature of the majority of research on
VC decision making.
Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it seeks to increase our
understanding of what VCs consider to be “knock-out criteria” (Franke et al., 2008) during the
decision-making process, and secondly, it attempts to highlight firm-specific factors inherent to
the decision-making process that are outside the realm of the entrepreneur’s influence, or even
awareness, and to date have gone largely unidentified. To shed light on these key issues, we
adopted an exploratory case study research design which is recommended for investigating
phenomena that are subtle and/or hardly understood. Specifically, our qualitative analysis is based
on a comprehensive, self-collected longitudinal data set spanning 11 years of archival data, which
included a total of 3,631 deal proposals, from a European-based VC firm.
Next, we review prior studies on VC decision making and point out key open questions in this
field of research. We then provide an overview of the research design used in this study and
present our key findings. The paper concludes with some theoretical as well as practical
implications of our results and we highlight areas for future research.
RESEARCH ON VC DECISION MAKING
The VC decision-making process and the criteria used to evaluate potential deals continue to
interest researchers after more than forty years. While the early literature primarily sought to
develop lists of factors deemed important by VCs (e.g., Hoban, 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984a;
MacMillan et al., 1985, 1987; Khan, 1987), a second stream of research further differentiated the
screening, evaluation and due diligence stages and developed models of the decision-making
process (e.g., Wells, 1974; Hall, 1989; Fried and Hisrich, 1994). Most recently, the focus of the
research agenda has returned to the decision-making criteria and has centered on the use of
decision aids (Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001, 2005) as well as a
deeper understanding of how VCs judge the more subjective, albeit important, criteria associated
with entrepreneurial teams (Franke et al., 2006, 2008). Table 1 provides an overview of prior
research into VC decision making.
The decision-making criteria reported to be important in the evaluation process by VCs have
consistently been the characteristics of (i) the company’s management team, (ii) the market, (iii)
the product or service, and (iv) the venture’s financial potential (Riquelme and Rickards, 1992;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Franke et al., 2008). Each of these broad categories of criteria have
been further broken down into several more specific factors which have been used by the majority
of researchers over the past forty years.
One defining characteristic of this stream of research is the preoccupation with the VC’s
assessment of the management team (Muzyka et al., 1996). For example, Franke et al. (2008)
applied conjoint analysis to arrive at a more detailed understanding of VCs’ evaluations of
management teams. They found that VCs prefer investing in teams in which all members have
industry experience, which can draw on a mixed educational background in terms of engineering

and management expertise, whose members have known each other for a longer time
professionally, and are relatively more mature (aged 35 to 45). In terms of the venture’s target
market, the prior literature indicates that VCs tend to prefer market opportunities of considerable
size and with high growth rates, as these market characteristics provide the conditions for strong
revenue growth and high levels of value creation (e.g., Tyebjee and Bruno, 1981; Bachher and
Guild, 1996). With regard to the venture’s product offering, prior research shows that VCs apply
evaluation criteria such as the innovativeness of the offering, its competitive advantage, some
proprietary protection of the product, and the level of need a potential customer has for the
offering (e.g., ‘must-have’ vs. ‘nice-to-have’ product) (e.g., Wells, 1974; Khan, 1987). Finally, in
terms of the venture’s financial potential, the extant literature highlights the importance of criteria
such as the expected rate of return and the expected risk associated with these returns (MacMillan
et al., 1985). While the financial potential of a venture is determined to a considerable extent by
management-, market- and product-related characteristics, evaluation criteria pertaining to the
financial prospects are nonetheless of major importance in the VC decision-making process, as a
VC firm needs to assess whether the business proposal has the potential to generate the required
minimum level of returns (Gompers and Lerner, 1999). For example, in return for financing an
early-stage venture, VCs typically expect a “10 in 5”, i.e., VCs look for a tenfold increase in
investment value over a five-year time horizon, equaling an annual compound interest of 58%
(Zider, 1998). While extant research provides a rich set of insights into VC decision making (cf.
Table 1), there are several larger issues that remain unaddressed in the literature.
(1) Deal Acceptance Criteria vs. Deal Rejection Criteria. With very few exceptions
(MacMillan et al., 1985; 1987; Bruno and Tyebjee, 1986) extant research has focused on
identifying the most important decision criteria that VCs apply when accepting deal proposals
(Hoffman, 1972; Wells, 1974; Khan, 1987; Hall, 1989; Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Muzyka et al.,
1996). Notably, most existing studies implicitly assume that these criteria also reflect the reasons
as to why business proposals get rejected. This is, however, a fairly bold assumption – the criteria
considered important for deal acceptance may, or may not, be the same criteria that lead to deal
rejection. Because VC decision making is characterized by an inordinate percentage of rejections
(remember that VCs typically reject 97 - 99% of all submitted business proposals), it is key for
research on VC decision making to develop a better understanding of the reasons for deal
rejection. In turn, such knowledge could also help entrepreneurs in developing and formulating
more compelling business cases, and VCs in improving their (limited) understanding of their own
decision-making process (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998).
(2) Firm-specific Factors influencing VC Decision Making. Current research provides insights
into the criteria VCs use in their ‘funding decisions’. This general perspective is at the same time a
strength and a weakness, the former because of the (assumed) broad applicability of research
insights, the latter because the generality of current findings also means a corresponding lack of
specificity. Other scholars have made similar claims (Sandberg et al., 1988; Muzyka et al., 1996;
Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999), and have suggested various valuable ways of developing more
specific insights. For example, Franke et al. (2008) provide fairly detailed results by focusing on
the evaluation of the management team. However, one important critique – namely that the current
literature on VC decision making is largely agnostic to VC-specific factors which are likely to
influence the importance of particular decision-making criteria – has not been answered to date.
For example, it seems that the availability of time that can be devoted to deal screening and
selection may vary greatly throughout the life of a fund, because many VC firms are taking an
active role in portfolio companies. In fact, empirical evidence indicates that VCs spend as much as
60% of their time on monitoring and assisting portfolio firms (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).
Hence, the actual procedures in use for deal evaluation may be quite different between the early

period of a fund and the subsequent portfolio monitoring and management phase. One of the key
reasons as to why we hardly possess any knowledge about the influence of these VC-specific
factors in VC decision making is that practically all of the published studies are cross-sectional
and focus on the VC decision-making process in and of itself. They thus fail to capture decision
making at different lifecycle stages of a fund, or, in the event that the VC is managing multiple
funds, across the life of a VC firm.
These observations served as departure points for the present study. Specifically, we set out to
investigate three interrelated research questions that will allow us to arrive at a more complete
understanding of the VC decision-making process:
1.
2.
3.

What evaluation criteria are identified as important when rejecting a business proposal?
Are these criteria consistently cited over the entire lifecycle of a venture fund?
Which additional firm-specific factors influence the VC decision-making process?
DATA & METHOD

Deal rejection in VC decision-making and the dynamics of the VC decision-making process
over the life of a venture fund are poorly understood research topics. To answer the research
questions outlined above, we thus chose an exploratory research design (a historical case study)
which is recommended for investigating phenomena that are subtle and/or hardly understood
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Yin, 2003). Exploratory case study research designs
have been usefully employed in a number of studies in entrepreneurship (e.g., Lichtenstein et al.,
2006). In particular, this type of research design permits a thorough understanding of the
phenomena in question, which is of great importance for developing new knowledge on complex
and dynamic phenomena such as VC decision-making over the lifetime of a venture fund (Fried
and Hisrich, 1988). As this study seeks to explore the factors affecting the VC decision-making
process over the life of a fund, the use of archival data analysis is preferred over an interview
approach because it allows for the collection and analysis of the different criteria and their
respective frequencies over several time periods (in our case, a total of 11 years). This approach
also provides access to the records showing what the subject of the study actually did or decided at
the time of the event rather than asking them to recall a distant, often non-significant event, and
thus helps enhance the validity of the data over that often associated with self-reported techniques
(Hall and Hofer, 1993; Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999).
Study Setting
This study uses archival data from a European VC firm, unknown to the researchers prior to
the study, which has multiple offices in Europe. The firm is focused on investing in seed-, earlyand late-stage companies from around the world within a specific high-tech, high growth industry.
Despite its financial success and the ability to attract limited partners for more than one fund – a
common occurrence in successful funds –, the firm remains relatively small, with fewer than ten
VCs, their support staff, and the original founders still active in the day-to-day operations of the
firm. The team is comprised of people from four different countries with each of the VCs in the
firm holding a graduate degree and at least five years of relevant industry experience. At the time
of data collection the firm had made a total of 35 portfolio investments, some of which had
received subsequent funding via both internal rounds and new financing rounds, across the two
funds. The average acceptance rate of deals submitted to the firm over the entire period was 1%,
which is consistent with the industry averages reported in many other studies. All of the
investments had been syndicated with other VC firms based in Europe and/or North America and

the firm under study had acted as both the lead and co-investor, the roles divided almost equally
across the portfolios. In the following, we will use the term “firm” to describe the VC firm,
whereas the terms “company”, “deal”, and “proposal” all apply to the entrepreneurial ventures
evaluated by the VC.
Data Collection Procedure
The data collected spans an 11-year period and includes information on deals that were
submitted to the firm during the life of two venture funds. Although the funds overlapped in time,
the origination and screening phases of Fund II were not initiated until after the final investment in
Fund I had been completed and officially announced to the limited partners. However, the same
team of VCs was responsible for all of the activities related to both funds, so while the investment
decision-making process had been completed in Fund I, they were still involved in the monitoring,
assistance and cashing-out activities while managing the origination, screening and evaluation
activities related to Fund II.
The data set was created by first reading emails and memos, both electronic and written, in the
archived deal files as well as all of the entries in the firm’s deal flow data base (“action log”)
which contained 7,284 passages of text. The primary source of data was the firm’s action log that
the firm uses to track the progress, comments, and ultimate disposition of a potential deal
throughout the evaluation process. Although the materials received from prospective companies
varied considerably in detail and length (ranging from short introductory emails and one-page
“teasers” to 176-page business plans) the VCs provided approximately the same amount of
information regarding their initial assessment of each deal filed as “Dead”; the term “DEAD” as
opposed to rejected was a term that the firm consistently used to categorize deals that had been
reviewed and, based upon reasons started, were no longer active in the deal flow process. In total,
the firm had received 3,631 deal proposals over the 11 years.
Data Analysis Procedure
The data was analyzed using qualitative methods (Locke, 2001; Roberts, 1997) which involved
an interpretative approach to the documents containing text related to the VC’s views and
decisions of the deals they had reviewed. Those comments representing the firm’s view or reasons,
both explicit and implied, for categorizing the deals as “Dead” were collected along with
information pertaining to the stage of the deal, the geographic region where the company was
domiciled, the referral source of the deal, the date the deal was first received by the VC, and the
date of the final disposition. While it was neither possible nor realistic to observe the firm over the
life of a fund, typically ten years (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989), having access to all of the internal
records and information related to each deal over the entire life of the VC firm facilitated the
development of a “practical understanding” (Miles and Huberman, 1994, p. 8) of the firm’s deal
screening and evaluation process as well as the evaluation criteria used by the firm.
Given that previous research on VC decision making had focused predominantly on positive
investment decisions, the initial review of the data was not approached with an a priori list of
specific criteria; however, an initial framework of broad categories, or preliminary codes, based
upon the existing literature was developed. However, these categories only served as a basis for
the iterative coding process which involved going back and forth between the data and the
emergent categories, similar to the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967,
Strauss and Corbin, 1998). The text was examined line by line and data specified categories
(Locke, 2001, p. 67) were assigned. This open coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) process, and the

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2009

<-----Page 7----->Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 3, Art. 1

creation of categories and the subsequent division, combination, or abolishment of the same, used
throughout the initial coding procedure was maintained in successive readings of the text. The
final coding scheme with the list of categories and codes is presented in Table 2.
Great care was taken in assuring the reliability of the coding. Once the hierarchical coding
scheme was developed, a random sample of excerpts from the data set was coded by a second
person not involved in the study, but who had been trained in the coding scheme. The interrater
agreement between the two raters was checked by computing Cohen’s Unweighted Kappa (Cohen,
1960). The value for Kappa ranges between 0 and 1, where K = 0 signifies no agreement between
the raters and K = 1 indicates perfect agreement between the raters. Although there is no definitve
value deemed as an acceptable level of reliability, a Cohen’s Kappa above .80 is generally
considered to demonstrate high interrater reliability (Landis and Koch, 1977). Having established
a high level of reliability (K= .91), all of text in the data set was coded.
FINDINGS
Our qualitative, longitudinal exploration of the VC decision-making process uncovered several
novel findings. We first report some of the more general results that provide background
information on key characteristics of the decision-making process in the examined VC firm. We
then focus on the criteria applied in deal rejection, and report how the fund lifecycle and other VCspecific factors influence the VC decision-making process.
The decision-making process observed in this VC firm largely resembles the process
previously described in the literature in that all of the deals received by the firm are subjected to an
initial screening with those deals considered potentially interesting being evaluated further and,
finally, more extensive due diligence is carried out on the minority of deals that are deemed
potentially viable based upon a number of factors. VCs at this firm estimated that about 20% of
business proposals made it past the screening phase, and about 10% received a preliminary
investment recommendation, that is, an internal document sent by the “sponsoring” individual to
the investment committee. These numbers also correspond to those frequently reported in the
literature on VC decision making (e.g., Roberts, 1991), suggesting the importance of research on
the criteria used for deal rejection.
Given that almost all prior studies investigated the criteria leading to deal acceptance, we were
particularly interested in better understanding the rejection of deal proposals by VCs.
Deal rejection criteria. The main categories of criteria identified by researchers as being
important to VCs when accepting deal proposals for financing are also evident in the reasons
stated for rejecting a deal. Several interesting results stand out in Figure 1, which provides an
overview of the reasons for rejection organized by fund year. First, we see that the typically
referenced reasons for deal acceptance (e.g. product, market, finance) also feature in the reasons
for deal rejection. Second, analyzing the trend over time reveals that VC fund-related reasons gain
in importance over the lifetime of a fund. Third, the one finding that at first appears counter to the
majority of previous research is the frequency of comments related to the characteristics of the
management team (n=93). The reasons stated (e.g., “Lack of confidence in management”, “Lack
of management team experience”, “Need of restructuring board and exchange CEO”) by the VCs
do reflect the criteria reported in previous studies. However, the frequencies are substantially
lower than one might expect given the high importance attributed to the management team in
previous research (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1985; Khan, 1986; Robinson, 1987; Wells, 1974). This
seems to be a result of prior research being primarily interested in the factors related to deal

acceptance, whereas our study captures the reasons for rejection that precede a VC’s final
decision. The few cases in the dataset may simply represent those where the management team is
an obvious disqualifier such as “CEO does not have the best reputation” and therefore is
considered a knock-out criterion.
Lost opportunities in the deal flow. Perhaps one of the most unexpected and instructive
findings regarding the deal flow is that although this VC firm, like most others, had only invested
in roughly 1% of the deals reviewed, the remaining 99% classified as Dead had not all been
rejected by the firm. Rather, a relatively large share of all received deal proposals – about 10% of
the 3,631 deals – were classified as Dead because the VC firm no longer had the opportunity to
pursue them. There were many reasons for these lost opportunities, but the majority of these cases
were simply because the respective companies failed to respond to the request for additional data.
Despite the VC’s efforts to receive more information and maintain a dialogue with these
companies, a surprisingly large number (n=192, or 5%) never responded to the VC. The following
quotes from the action log illustrate this point: “No response to request for more detailed revised
business plan.”, “DEAD no information received as requested”, “No response since sending out
confidentiality agreement”, “'Interesting but non-responsive company”.
It is important to note that all of these deals had been sent to the VC firm unsolicited and the
firm waited almost half a year, often sending additional requests in the interim, before categorizing
the deal proposals as Dead. Without contacting these companies, it is not possible to know exactly
why they failed to respond to the VC’s signal of potential interest, but judging from the comments
regarding other deals that did not go forward, a few potential reasons for non-response could be (i)
the requested information was unavailable or too difficult for the company to compile, (ii) the
company received funding from another source, (iii) the company went bankrupt in the meantime,
or (iv) that the company’s management had changed their mind regarding the raising of external
funding in general.
The remaining 5% of the deals that were “lost” by the firm can be attributed to decisions made
by the company with respect to VC funding in general or, in some cases, specifically related to the
VC firm in the study: “Dead Company decided to go with alternative VC deal.”, “Management
not ready for VC.”, “Company unwilling to accept certain Term Sheet conditions.” “Company
decided against a later closing due to oversubscription, therefore no slot available for us. Keep
in contact for future rounds.”, “Finance discussions with unknown competitors. Company might
come back. No response (after 3 months).”
However, unlike the previous sub-group of lost opportunities that failed to respond during the
initial screening and evaluation phase, this second sub-group of companies had progressed through
the evaluation phase and was often in the due diligence process, or even in the final stage of
investment consideration. This distinction is important as it implies that the VC had already
expressed a genuine interest in the deal. The VC had also expended a substantial investment of
time and financial resources in their pursuit of these opportunities, most of which would be simply
expensed and considered a sunk cost.
Open-door rejection. Throughout the data set there were comments that showed that “no” in
the VC context is not always a definitive rejection. Although the overwhelming majority of deals
rejected by the VC were given no indication of any potential future interest, there were comments
in both the internal records and the letters of rejection to companies that provided evidence of the
VC’s willingness to reconsider the deal at a later time. The reasons for this future potential
included both company-specific issues as well as ones related to the VC firm or the specific VC

<-----Page 9----->Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 3, Art. 1

fund. In instances when the VC firm saw potential promise in a deal, they not only told the
company why the deal was being rejected, but also provided very specific feedback with respect to
the firm’s interest, when the company should resubmit, and any necessary milestones to be
achieved in order for the firm to pursue a subsequent evaluation. The VC’s log provides several
interesting illustrations of this issue: “Interesting concept but too early stage,…should come back
in second round”, “Proof-of-concept in maybe about 9 months, company shall come back then.”
“Too early but candidate for next fund”, “Does not really fit our portfolio at the time, but stay in
touch”. However, even though the firm had “left the door open” with many deals (n=146), there
were only 22 instances where these companies submitted their proposals to the firm a second or
third time; one of which was ultimately accepted as portfolio deal. This low response rate, much
like the “no response” rate, may be due to a variety of factors not related to the VC firm’s
comments or request and can only be captured through contacting the companies directly. This
finding, while new to the literature, is not altogether remarkable when one considers the difficulty
and time requirements associated with sourcing quality deal flow (Gifford, 1997), the potential
need to identify complementary skills or products to help existing portfolio companies, and the
value of access to information about emerging companies and or technologies.
We now discuss our findings from a longitudinal perspective. In addition to those firm-specific
factors related to the general firm strategy and deal characteristics that have been identified in past
research (Wells, 1974; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984a, 1984b; Hall, 1989), there are also factors that
appear to be a result of VC characteristics and, in particular, the lifecycle of the VC fund, and thus
are only likely to be captured in longitudinal or ethnographic studies.
The effect of time. Although some of the findings reported above are directly related to process
or timing issues, their potential impact on the decision-making process is not fully appreciated
unless they are viewed collectively over the entire timeline of the firm (See Figure 1).
Several observations seem to be particularly noteworthy. First, we see that across the lifecycle
of an investment fund, there is quite some fluctuation in the primary criteria applied to reject deals.
This is an important finding, as it highlights the dynamics of the VC decision-making process over
time. Second, we see an intriguing increase of the fund-related reasons over the years indicating
that there are factors within the VC firm that become more important in decision making over
time. Importantly, these types of reasons have been neglected in prior research on VC decisionmaking criteria, which can be seen as a major shortcoming because fund-related reasons are the
primary rejection criteria in the final years of our observation period (Years 9, 10 and 11). We will
look more closely at one key driving force for this result – portfolio composition – below. Third,
we see a rise and fall of the market- and product-related reasons which may be attributable to
factors outside of the firm such as increased interest in a particular industry or market that fuels
entrepreneurial activity and a subsequent increase in the submission of lower quality business
proposals. Fourth, we now see in a more detailed manner that evaluation criteria related to the
management team feature least prominently in deal rejection. Although the logged rejection
criteria are also a function of the VC’s deal flow, this result is nonetheless puzzling. Most notably,
as noted above this results runs counter to one’s intuition, because one would expect that teamrelated criteria feature much more prominently given that the management team has consistently
been ranked as the most important evaluation criterion when it comes to deal acceptance.
VC management time. Although the number is quite small (n=66), there were times when the
firm simply did not have the management capacity within the team to adequately pursue a
potential deal, even when the deal was acknowledged to be potentially viable. The firm noted in its
action log: “Interesting but time constraints due to other due diligence.”, “Too busy with other

projects.”, “Rejected due to high activity on other deals at this time.”, “Were too occupied with
four own closings to participate.”, “Not at the moment due to our Deal Flow.”
Resubmissions over time. Prior research suggests that once a deal is rejected by a VC, there is
no chance that this particular VC will review the deal again, let alone provide funding for it. While
we already noted that there were 146 open door rejections, our longitudinal data allows us to track
whether rejected deal proposals that did not receive an invitation to resubmit actually were
submitted to the VC firm again after some time. Table 3 indicates the number of times the VC
firm had received a deal. Two observations are particularly interesting: First, we see that there
were an astoundingly high number of 438 proposals that were submitted to the firm more than
once. Only 22 of these deal proposals had been invited for resubmission as per the VC firm’s
feedback (see section on “Open door rejection”). Second, the VC firm invested in approximately
the same share of these resubmitted deals as in the original deals (1% in the second submission
attempt, and 2% in the third submission attempt), despite having already rejected the deals once;
the one exception being the successful fourth submission (7% acceptance rate) but that is due to
the deal being one of only 14 proposals sent four times.
CONCLUSIONS
This study is based upon the actions and decisions of VCs operating within their normal
context and therefore captures what was actually done at the time of the real decision rather than
what is reported in response to a survey or interview about past deals. This difference alone may
explain why, despite the fact that many of the criteria cited as the reasons for the Dead deals are
consistent with those identified in previous research, the operational demands on the VC
management team’s time and the profile of portfolio companies within the fund appear to impact
the decisions made by the VCs more so than in previous studies.
When viewed from the perspective of rejection, the impact of firm-specific, VC-specific factors
appears to be more pronounced than previously considered, and the conceptualization of VC
decision making appears to be more dynamic when one considers the effects of time. Also, in
order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of VC decision making, more attention
should be given to these Dead deals. VCs are assumed by many to be expert decision makers and
VC firms are commonly judged by the performance of their portfolios, which only represents one
percent of the deals reviewed, with little to no consideration for the other 99% that were not
selected. That said, this study reveals that not all dead deals are the result of rejection by the VC,
so researchers should be wary when collecting and interpreting data related to deal
acceptance/rejection rates.
Based upon this research the most important, yet basic, advice to entrepreneurs is to maintain
communication with the VC if they have expressed interest in the deal. It is all too easy for a VC
to tell a company that their proposal does not meet the needs of the firm, so when a VC takes the
time to request information or provide feedback and encourages someone to come back, it is a sign
that your deal is still being considered. Along similar lines, it seems that VCs should reevaluate
their practices regarding the deals they have rejected. Because the market for quality deals is
highly competitive, VCs should seek to strengthen their relationships with companies they believe
are potential candidates for future funding. Entrepreneurs should also spend time learning about
the firms they send their proposals to in order to tailor their documents to the current phase of the
fund and/or requirements of each firm. Two firms with similar investment strategies may view the
same proposal quite differently simply by virtue of the fact that they are focused on different
criteria based upon the lifecycle phase each firm is in at the time. Finally, our findings also suggest

that VC firms should evaluate their existing management capacity and develop strategies to
accommodate for times when they experience increased deal flow, above average due diligence
activity or number of deal closings.
While this study provides additional insights into the decision-making process, many questions
still remain unanswered. For example, much research has been conducted on the evaluation of the
entrepreneurial team and the relevance of this evaluation, but the biases similar to those reported
in Franke et al. (2006) may very well influence the evaluation of factors related to the other key
criteria, namely the product and industry. Additionally, how does the participation in syndicates
bias the evaluation and selection process? Guler (2007) showed that reinvestment decisions are
influenced by the politics of the industry so it is highly likely that this institutional process also
influences initial investments as well.
