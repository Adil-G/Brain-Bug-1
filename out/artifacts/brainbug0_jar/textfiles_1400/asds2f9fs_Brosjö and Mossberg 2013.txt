Abstract
It is widely accepted that innovation is strongly connected to the growth and competitiveness
of an organization (Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004; Aiman-Smith et al. 2005), meanwhile
both practitioners and academia have expressed a lack of access to a good instrument for
evaluating the performance of the same (Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994; Muller et al.
2005). Within this field, a number of authors have identified auditing as being appropriate
method to use (Chiesa et al. 1996; Radnor and Noke 2002; Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004),
although large deficiencies and constraints are identified regarding the usefulness and the
usability of the existing innovation audit tools.
This study is made in collaboration with ÅF AB, a leading Swedish technical consulting firm,
which has expressed an interest for a tool for evaluating the innovation performance of its
high-tech product development customers aimed for usage within the sales organization.
Therefore, the purpose of this master thesis is to investigate the aspects of usefulness and
usability in innovation auditing by developing an audit tool that identifies unrealized
innovation potential in a product company’s innovation process. The tool should consider
both the factor of usefulness (to make the tool situation customized) and the factor of usability
(as seen from a practitioner’s perspective). Briefly, a qualitative research approach was used,
carried out through five in-depth interviews with companies whose principal activity is
development of high-tech products (in order to investigate the usefulness), as well as
representatives from the ÅF AB’s sales organization (in order to investigate the usability).
This research has explored the area of innovation auditing and has presented a result of an
audit prototype with properties that no other innovation audit has, due to that it is based on a
designed strategy dependent innovation framework. Choosing innovation strategy as
contingency factor is appropriate since it has showed to have significant impact on the
positive outcome of the innovation process (Clercq et al. 2009). Further, the success factor
lies within following a chosen strategy, and does not depend on which particular strategy that
is adopted (Jaruzelski et al. 2012). This research has taken the aspects of usability and
usefulness in innovation auditing a step further by giving them extra focus in the
development. An increased focus on usefulness makes the usage of this developed audit more
adapted and applicable to companies using it (which leads to a more accurate analysis), and
the focus on increased usability makes it more easy to use by practitioners.

Sammanfattning
Det är vida accepterat att begreppet innovation är starkt kopplat till en organisations tillväxt
och konkurrenskraft (Cormican och O'Sullivan 2004; Aiman-Smith et al. 2005), samtidigt
som både praktiker och akademiker har uttryckt en brist på tillgång till ett bra instrument för
utvärdera just innovationsförmågan på ett företag (Montoya-Weiss och Calantone 1994;
Muller et al. 2005). Vidare, inom området för att utvärdera innovationsförmåga har ett antal
forskare identifierade auditing som en lämplig metod att använda (Chiesa et al. 1996; Radnor
och Noke 2002; Cormican och O'Sullivan 2004), även då stora begränsningar identifierats för
existerande innvoations-audits när det kommer till användbarhet och användarvänlighet.
Denna studie är gjord i samarbete med ÅF AB, ett ledande svenskt teknikkonsultföretag, som
har uttryckt intresse för ett verktyg som kan utvärdera innovationsförmågan inom
produktutveckling hos sina kunder, samt användas i deras organisation för sälj. Syftet med
denna studie är därmed att undersöka aspekterna användbarhet och användarvänlighet inom
innovations-auditing, genom att utveckla ett audit-verktyg som identifierar orealiserad
innovationspotential i ett produktföretags innovationsprocess. Verktyget skall ta hänsyn till
både användbarheten (för att göra verktyget så situationsanpassat som möjligt) och
användarvänligheten (sett från en användares perspektiv). En kvalitativ forskningsmetodik
tillämpades vilken genomfördes genom fem djupintervjuer med högteknologiska
produktbolag (i syfte att undersöka användbarheten), samt representanter från ÅF AB:s
försäljningsorganisation (i syfte att undersöka användbarheten).
Slutligen, denna studie har utforskat området innovation-auditing och resultatet är en prototyp
av en audit med egenskaper som ingen annan existerande innovations-audit har. Detta p.g.a.
att verktyget är baserad på ett, i denna studie designat, strategiberoende innovationsramverk.
Innovationsstrategi valdes för att situationsanpassa verktyget, vilket var lämpligt då det har
visat att ha stor påverkan på det positiva resultatet utav innovationsprocessens inom ett bolag
(Clercq et al. 2009). Framgångsfaktorn ligger även i att ett bolag följer en vald strategi och är
inte beroende av vilken strategi som har antagits (Jaruzelski et al. 2012). Vidare har denna
studie tagit aspekterna användbarhet och användarvänlighet inom innovation-auditing ett steg
längre genom att ge dem extra fokus i utvecklingen av verktyget. Fokusen på ökad
användbarhet gör tillämpningen av verktyget mer anpassad för användarna (vilket leder till en
mer noggrann analys) och fokusen på ökad användarvänlighet gör det lättare att använda.

<-----Page 8----->1 INTRODUCTION
This master thesis is made in cooperation with ÅF AB (henceforth referred to as ÅF), a
Swedish company leading in technical consulting. The main research area deals with the need
to find a tool able to evaluate and assess the innovation potential of a firm with product
development as core business. This chapter presents the background of the research, the
purpose, research questions, delimitations as well as the structure of the report.

1.1 Background
It is widely accepted that innovation is central to the growth of output and productivity
(OECD, 2005) as well as, from an organizational point of view, the basic prerequisite for an
organization to survive and stay competitive (Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004; Aiman-Smith et
al. 2005; Muller et al. 2005). According to the OECD (2005, p. 46), innovation may be
defined as “the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service),
a process, a new marketing method, a new organizational method in business practices,
workplace organization or external relations”.
Further, Muller et al. (2005) have recognized that managers generally have a vague sense of
their company’s overall innovativeness and a good instrument for evaluating innovation
performance is required by the same, as well as by academia (Montoya-Weiss and Calantone,
1994). A number of authors emphasize auditing as a method appropriate to use for firms to
evaluate the activities of technological innovation, with the aim to improve performance
within the field (Chiesa et al. 1996; Radnor and Noke 2002; Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004).
Although, several constraints regarding the usefulness and the usability are identified with
existing innovation auditing tools, where usefulness refers to practical worth or applicability
in terms of relevant result to the company audited, and usability is closely related to userfriendliness and the convenience and practicality of use. These identified constraints
regarding usefulness and usability makes the area of innovation auditing interesting to
investigate further.
Two limiting factors in innovation audits are emphasized by Zheng et al. (2009); (1) that they
do often pay too much attention on the direct output of technological innovation (and tend to
ignore the assessment of the process), and (2) that they fail to evaluate knowledge
performance which would bring sustainable competitive advantage for a firm. Further, the
complexity of a product innovation process and the fact that the process is hard to generalize
(Tidd and Bessant 2009; Goffin and Mitchell 2010) also impairs the usefulness of the broad
innovation audits existing in theory today. Further, the existing audits do neither consider that
the early innovation process is supported by different factors that need to be evaluated in
different ways (Jaruzelski, 2012). The focus of previous frameworks has been “one size fits
all” which reduces the accuracy of the results and the usefulness when auditing an
organization. The usability has also shown to be reduced for practitioners, due to the lack of
implementation plans and analysis manuals, as well as due to the wide usage of unexplained
academic terminology. The above states that there is an identified need of an innovation audit
tool that can adapt to contingency factors (to become more useful) and that is more usable for
practitioners.
The authors of this report argue that the usefulness of an innovation audit increases if the level
of adaption increases. This is why a factor that highly affects innovation was sought for – to
become an appropriate contingency factor for an innovation audit tool. Koen et al. (2001)
1

<-----Page 9----->argue that the greatest opportunities for improving the overall innovation process are provided
in the front end of innovation (FEI), which comprises of five elements: Opportunity
identification, Opportunity analysis, Idea genesis, Idea selection and Concept and technology
development (Koen et al. 2001). Further, Clercq et al. (2008) conclude that an innovation
strategy successfully affects the idea generation phase and the design phase. Hence, a firm’s
innovation strategy is arguably a factor that affects the innovation process to a large extent,
which the authors of this report would like to investigate if that might be an appropriate
contingency factor for an innovation audit tool in order to make it more useful.
Further, ÅF is a leading Swedish technical consultancy firm with focus on energy and the
environment, investments in infrastructure and projects for industry. The company has about
7000 employees and consists of four divisions; the international, industry, infrastructure and
technology divisions. Managers at ÅF Technology – the division that provides solutions and
consulting services within product development – have identified an increased interest and
need for innovation among its largest product development customers. As explicit services
directed to these types of needs are not part of ÅF’s regular service portfolio, the sales
organization is not familiar with how to start selling these services. Therefore, Jonas Larsson,
Business Area Manager at ÅF Technology, has requested a tool able to assess ÅF’s
customers’ innovation potential – where “potential” implies a possibility of improvement
within a specific area. The requested tool should be used by the sales organization and should
be the basis for the forming of customer specific advice on how to excel in innovation, thus
grow ÅFs and their customers’ relations and businesses. The authors of this report therefore
find ÅF Technology an appropriate case company and partner for this investigation.

1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate the aspects of usefulness and usability
within the field of innovation auditing and to create an audit tool that identifies unrealized
innovation potential in a product company’s innovation process. The audit tool should
consider both the factor of usefulness – to make the tool situation customized – and the factor
of usability – as seen from a practitioner’s perspective – in order to optimize the two aspects
and be a stronger alternative compared to existing audits on the market today.

1.3 Research questions
The research questions are formulated in accordance to the background and the purpose:
RQ1: How can a strategy dependent innovation organizing framework be designed that may
act as a foundation to an innovation audit tool?
RQ2: How can a strategy dependent innovation organizing framework be transformed into a
useful and usable audit tool that identifies unrealized innovation potential?

1.4 Delimitations
This research concerns the innovation process of a company and the product innovation
occurring within this process. The innovation process is delimited to the early phases, i.e. the
phases from opportunity identification to finalized concept before industrialization. This is
due to that the early phases are where the greatest opportunities of affecting an innovation
process of a company are identified (Koen et al. 2001).

<-----Page 10----->1.5 Structure of the report
This report consists of 9 chapters. The first chapter – Introduction – presents the background
of the thesis, as well as the purpose, research questions and the research delimitations.
In the second chapter – Theoretical framework – a review of the previous literature that lies
within the foundation of this research will be presented. The same literature will be used in
the coming analysis and discussion. The review consists of 4 sub-chapters. Initially, the
concept of innovation will be presented. Secondly, a review of existing innovation audits will
be presented with the aim to identify advantages and shortcomings of the same, and to be able
to compare the developed audit of this report with previous audits. Thirdly, a holistic
innovation organizing framework is presented which will be used as a basis for the new
strategy dependent innovation framework that will be designed. Lastly, the concept of
innovation strategy and an innovation strategy framework are introduced, also with the aim to
be used in the design of the new strategy dependent innovation framework.
The third chapter – Methodology – presents the research design and process, as well as the
limitations of the research and source criticism.
Chapter four – Analytical framework – presents the creation of the strategy dependent
innovation framework aimed for answering research question 1. The holistic innovation
framework and the innovation strategy framework, both presented in Chapter 2 Theoretical
framework, will here be merged into one.
In the fourth chapter – Empirical results – the results from the empirical study are compiled.
The aim of the qualitative empirical study is to evaluate the framework designed in Chapter 4
Analytical framework, and to investigate how to maximize the usefulness and usability of the
later developed tool.
Chapter six – Analysis – analyses the empirical results compared with theory. The final
revisions of the created strategy dependent innovation framework are presented, and the
usability requirements for the tool are set.
Chapter seven – Tool design – presents the creation of the audit tool, based on the created
strategy dependent innovation framework. The final prototype of the tool is presented as well
as an explanation of the procedure when using it. This chapter aims at answering research
question 2.
In chapter eight – Discussion – a discussion regarding the developed framework and tool are
presented, as well as final remarks that the authors of this report would like to emphasize.
The last chapter, chapter nine – Recommendations and future work – presents
recommendations and suggestions of future work.

<-----Page 11----->2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
This section presents theory from previous literature that will form the basis for the
discussion and analysis in this research. The concept innovation will be presented as well as
a review of existing innovation audits. Further, an innovation organizing framework is
presented, and the concept of innovation strategy is introduced.

2.1 Innovation
Previous research within the field of innovation gives evidence of a wide range of different
conceptions of a fragmented area. Established researchers agree on innovation as a
phenomenon that is complex and multidimensional (Wolfe 1994; Adams et al. 2006) and that
the term ”innovation” is ambiguous and lacks a single, accepted definition (Adams et al.,
2006).
Despite the ambiguity and the wide perception that permeates the concept, it is widely
accepted that innovation is central to the growth of output and productivity (OECD 2005) as
well as, from an organizational point of view, the basic prerequisite for an organization to
survive and stay competitive (Aiman-Smith et al. 2005; Muller et al. 2005). According to
Tidd and Bessant (2009), innovation can be seen as a competitive advantage since new
products or services help organizations to capture and retain market shares.
Aiman-Smith et al. (2005) states that innovation has two parts; (1) the generation of an idea
and (2) the conversion of that idea into a useful application. Other researchers have adopted a
process view of innovation, such as Tidd and Bessant (2009, p. 16) who explain the term as:
“a process of turning opportunity into new ideas and of putting these into widely used
practice”. Another definition of innovation, commonly referred to in previous literature, is the
UK Department of Trade and Industry’s (1998) as cited by Adams et al. (2006, p. 22), which
reads “the successful exploitation of new ideas” which further encompasses the whole range
of innovation types that that one can expect to encounter in an organization (e.g.
product/service, technological, process, administrative, etc.). Finally, the OECD (2005, p. 46)
stands for another broad definition which reads “an innovation is the implementation of a new
or significantly improved product (good or service), a process, a new marketing method, a
new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization or external
relations”, a definition that also considers different innovation types.
The definitions made by Tidd and Bessant (2009), the UK Department of Trade and Industry
(1998) as cited by Adams et al. (2006) and the OECD (2005) all capture a process view and a
broad perspective of innovation which is in line with the perspective used when conducting
this study. Thus, the authors of this report have chosen to define innovation as “the successful
exploitation of new ideas”.
2.1.1 The innovation process
There are two common approaches present in previous literature regarding how to illustrate an
innovation process, i.e. the process of successfully exploiting new ideas. Some researchers
simplify it as a linear process, and others have tried to include the complexity of innovation
(i.e. claim that linearity in an innovation process is impossible) in their illustrations. The
greatest chance of affecting the overall innovation process of a company is in the early phases
of innovation (Koen et al. 2001). This is the reason why this is the chosen scope of the thesis.
Koen et al. (2001) refer to these early phases as “the front end of innovation” (FEI), which
4

<-----Page 12----->include the five elements; Opportunity identification, Opportunity analysis, Idea genesis, Idea
selection and Concept and technology development. These are described in brief below.
Opportunity identification represents the stage where the company identifies the opportunities
that the company wants to pursue and is typically driven by the goals of the organization.
Opportunity identification is followed by the element Opportunity analysis. This is where the
identified opportunities are translated into specific business and technology opportunities. The
next element, Idea genesis, is signified by the concretization of ideas, often via brainstorming.
Once concrete ideas have been formed, the Idea selection element commences. The
procedures used to select ideas differ as the information on which to base these decisions of is
often limited. The final element Concept and technology development describes the forming
of a business case based on the estimates of e.g. market potential, customer need or
competitor assessments. This stage also includes prototyping and prototype testing. (Koen et
al. 2001)

2.2 Innovation audits
A widely stated definition of a general audit is “an evaluation of a person, organization,
system, process, enterprise, project or product” (Karlsson et al. 2010). Further, the purpose of
an innovation audit – in the context of an organization – is to discover the exact strengths and
weaknesses of an organization’s innovation processes and practices, and to determine the best
ways to improve the performance (Karlsson et al. 2010). Audits also help organizations to
highlight strengths and weaknesses in order to do internal analysis as well as external
comparisons. The characteristics and purpose of audits were seen to correlate well with the
solution that was sought after by ÅF which is why developing an audit based tool was
considered. Hence, the author found it relevant to review some of the most widely cited and
recognized innovation audits in order to identify why these audits are not sufficient. This
review is presented below.
2.2.1 Existing innovation audits
Innovation audits in research literature are designed in similar ways. Most commonly, the first
step is the forming of a problem to be solved by constructing the audit. The problem
formulation is followed by the choice or construct of a model or framework of the innovation
process which is later transformed into an audit tool. The audit is later tested in order to
evaluate its functionality, usefulness and usability. The reviewed audits in this study all follow
this pattern during the designing. These innovation audits are the ones designed by Aimansmith et al. (2005), Chiesa et al. (1996) – which is the most cited innovation audit – Cormican
and O’Sullivan (2004), Muller and Välikangas (2005) and Tang (1999).
Tang (1999) describes two approaches to study organizational innovativeness; top-down and
bottom-up, and the two methodologies include both quantitative and qualitative methods. The
top-down approach means that the researcher views the organization through aggregated
information and perspectives provided by the management. The bottom-up approach requires
the researcher to gather information through the individuals who work in the organization and
are involved in innovation activities. All studied audits use the top-down approach, expect of
the one developed by Tang (1999) which uses the bottom-up. All audits have adopted a
quantitative approach where Muller et al. (2005) offer managers the possibility to compare
number-based measures over time. The prior audits studied compare the reviewed companies
to best-in-class examples.

5

<-----Page 13----->Further, audits are in general practically executed through the usage of Likert scales, where
the respondent is meant to self-estimate how well a number of statements match the
performance of the organization and the way the organization handles innovation, or an
innovation process (Karlsson et al. 2010).
As described in Chapter 2.1.1 The innovation process, this process may be described as a
linear process or in a more complex manner. These different views are also reflected in the
reviewed audits. What are seen as a commonality in all the audits reviewed are the relatively
general frameworks they are based on. The structures, in which the measurement areas are
sorted, differ both in terms of numbers of areas used as well as in the way they are grouped. A
mapping of the reviewed audits’ approach/method, innovation type, target group and included
measurement areas can be seen in Table 1 below. Althoug, the measurement areas and factors
coincide to a degree, they are not fully aligned. For example, Chiesa et al. (1996) include
product development, a measurement area not included in the residual audits, but have left out
the aspect of communication. Further, leadership is used in all frameworks except for AimanSmith et al.’s (2005). The only audit including collaboration is Cormican and O’Sullivan
(2004).

An aspect within which the reviewed audits differ regards the information included regarding
the usage of the audit. Chiesa et al. (1996) do not elaborate on the conditions required in order
to carry out the audit, such as who should answer the audit questions more specifically than “a
manager”. Cormican O’Sullivan (2004) state that the audit developed is a self-assessment
scorecard while Aiman-Smith (2005) takes this one step further and emphasizes that the tool
is designed to be used on a cross-sectional large sample of 200 respondents or more. Neither
of the audits present backgrounds on the factors measured or explains terminology to the
person filling out the survey. Chiesa et al. (1996) discusses the aspect of functionality and
7

<-----Page 15----->usability though Tang (1999) stands alone in incorporating recommended practices in
questionnaire design.
In general, the reviewed audits lack factors that make the audits user-friendly and easy to
apply straight ahead in practice. Aiman-Smith et al. (2005) have attached a section that
suggests four steps in how best to use the audit developed, something that is not done by the
others. A main problem found with all the audits reviewed, is their lack of a manual, structure
or instruction to guide the auditor through the process of auditing. The possible consequences
of this are several, such as time loss for the person auditing as well as the person being
audited, an unclearly communicated purpose of the audit and unreliable answers and results.
Nothing speaks for the fact that the person conducting the audit has experience within the
field of innovation, which further emphasizes the importance of a manual or instructions.
The focus of the audits also varies. Cormican and O’Sullivan’s (2004, p. 828) underlying
objective is to develop more robust, generalizable guidelines for managers in technologybased companies who want to build successful new product portfolios. This is in line with
Aiman-Smith et al.’s (2005, p. 38) more general focus as the audit designed rather is a tool
that can reliably and validly measure important aspects of an organization’s potential for
value innovation.
Several audits also lack instructions of how the particular analysis of the audit answers should
be carried out. As previously mentioned, some audits use best-in-class examples to compare
the results with, (e.g. Cormican and O’Sullivan (2004)) though it is not explained further how
answers should be interpreted. Also, deficiencies with best-in-class comparisons come with
the nature of innovation – all circumstances regarding innovation are very context dependent
and it is hard to compare ones results with others. Muller et al. (2005) has noted this difficulty
and chosen measuring over time and comparing with the company itself.
It is undoubtedly so that neither of the many general frameworks mapped can be sees as
covering all relevant areas affecting innovation (see Table 1). A framework’s exclusion of
areas of importance negatively affects the usefulness of the audit as factors within such an
area are not considered when analyzing the company’s strengths and weaknesses. A holistic
framework is seen to be absent, which is agreed on by Adams et al. (2006). This implies that
there is no framework set out to cover all factors that may affect the innovation process and
that need to be audited.
What is largely seen as the main limiting factor regarding the usefulness of the audits
reviewed is their adoption of a “one size fits all” framework – although adapting the audit to a
firm is considered important (Chiesa et al. 1996). Innovation performance may e.g. be
measured by the performance of each core and enabling process that is relevant for the firm
(Chiesa et al. 1996) although it is not elaborated on what makes a process relevant or not.
Muller et al. (2005) stand alone in including brief guidelines on how to adapt metrics to a firm
as well as recommending different sets of metrics for either beginners in innovation and
veterans in innovation. Thus, Muller et al. (2005) act according to Chiesa et al.’s (1996)
statement on the importance of adapting the audit after the company audited. Concordantly,
all other audits are unexpressed in conducting a relatively general innovation performance
audit that does not take into account external factors, such as the industry, or internal factors,
such as innovation strategy.

<-----Page 16----->2.3 A holistic innovation framework
Previous innovation literature reflects a diversity of approaches with the aim to evaluate or
measure a firm’s innovation ability. In turn, these approaches are based on a variety of
innovation models or frameworks, including processes or structures that should be in place in
order for a firm to succeed within the area. Subsequently, Adams et al. (2006) identified the
absence of a holistic framework covering the full range of activities required to turn ideas into
marketable products, and incorporated the wide body of diverse literature into one single
framework.
The framework by Adams et al. (2006) is constructed by measurement areas that are
empirically demonstrated to be significant for innovation – areas that are most relevant to
examine if an organization’s innovation abilities are to be evaluated. Although, to confirm
that the framework contains the relevant areas to consider when evaluating an organization’s
innovation ability, a mapping of such areas was made by the authors of this report including
other more specialized frameworks beyond the ones included in Adams et al.’s (2006)
research. This mapping is presented in Appendix A. Only a few areas included in Adams et
al.’s (2006) framework were not widely mentioned by others which confirm its holistic scope.
Thus, this holistic framework was used as a foundation in this report to understand what
mechanisms that must be in place in order to support innovative behavior within a firm.
Further, due to the extensive and validated research made behind this framework, as well as
the acceptance it has gained, the researchers of this report found it relevant to use this
established framework in its whole as the basis to understand innovation.
The framework consists of seven categories: inputs management, knowledge management,
strategy implementation and usage, organizational culture, portfolio management, project
management and commercialization. Further, each category is populated with measurement
areas. The categories and respective measurement areas are presented in Table 2, with the
exception of the commercialization category, which is not covered by the scope of this report.

<-----Page 17----->The sections below present the framework as developed by Adams et al. (2006), i.e. all
reviewed information below is based on the same article by the same.
2.3.1 Inputs management
Adams et al. (2006) take on a broad perspective on the inputs needed for innovation which
relates to the resourcing of innovation activities and includes the measurement areas people,
physical and financial resources, and tools. Each of the categories is described in a relatively
general sense and it is not clearly stated when which of the many factors as more or less
important for a specific company to succeed.
The people measurement area concerns people that are committed to the innovation task
within a firm. Individuals tend to have different propensities to innovate. When in teams,
innovation is stimulated by diversity among the team members regarding demographic
characteristics, such as sex, age, cosmopolitanism, education, skills and experience. Members
with high level of education also increase the effectiveness of R&D project teams.
The physical and financial resources measurement areas capture a range of inputs from
buildings to computer equipment. Another important general measure of facilities is slack.
Slack resources – or unused capacity – may be regarded as an important catalyst for
innovation since it allows failures to be absorbed, provides the opportunity for diversification,
and fosters a culture of experimentation and protects against the uncertainty of project failure.
The tool measurement area refers to systems and tools as important input to the innovation
process. Such supporting systems and tools may be tools or techniques to promote creativity
or the availability and use of systems of quality control ranging from informal methods to
specific techniques (such as total quality management etc.).
2.3.2 Knowledge management
Knowledge management is concerned with obtaining and communicating ideas and
information that underlie innovation competencies and includes idea generation, absorptive
capacity and networking and knowledge absorption – an organization’s ability to identify,
acquire, and utilize external knowledge – is critical to a firm’s successful operation. Further,
knowledge management covers the management of explicit and implicit knowledge held by
an organization as well as the processes of gathering and using information. The measurement
areas of knowledge management are idea generation, knowledge repository (including the
management of implicit and explicit knowledge) and information flows (including
information gathering and networking).
The core in the idea generation measurement area is the importance of generating sufficient
number of ideas – the raw materials for innovation – which are also relatively inexpensive to
generate and screen. The amount of ideas, the appropriateness of them, the feasibility and the
timeframe are interesting dimensions within this area.
The knowledge repository measurement area refers to the importance of measuring the
accumulated knowledge of a firm, since it is fundamental for innovation. One aspect of
innovation relates to the combination of new and existing knowledge, which privileges the
contribution of external and internal knowledge and the mechanisms by which it flows into
and within an organization. Further, central to this measurement area is the ability of a firm to
absorb and make use of new knowledge, and the ability to recognize the value of new,
external knowledge, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends. Counting numbers of or the
value of patents are frequently used measurements, but the validity of patent statistics are
today questioned since they vary in their utility for organizations.
10

<-----Page 18----->The information flows measurement area is concerned with the importance of allowing the
development of innovative concepts. Information flows may be linkages that the innovation
group at the firm maintains with external organizations and sources (e.g. universities), internal
information gathering processes or customer information contacts.
It is clear that generating ideas, sharing information as well as identifying, acquiring and
utilizing knowledge are of high importance for a firm to innovate. An aspect that is not
considered or described by Adams et al. (2006) is which type of knowledge this refers to and
if the same knowledge is important to all firms.
2.3.3 Strategy implementation and usage
Innovation strategy is generally understood to describe an organization’s innovation posture
with regard to its competitive environment in terms of its new product and market
development plans. Evidence of a firm’s innovation strategy is also reflected among the input
measurement areas (where a specific example is the level of R&D expenditures), which in
turn reflects how a firm intends to spend money and resources to achieve set innovation
targets. Inefficiencies in the innovation process are less likely to occur where an innovation
strategy is not just nominally adopted, but is embedded in the culture, behaviors and actions
of the organization. Further, two measurement areas are identified within this category;
strategic orientation and strategic leadership.
The strategic orientation measurement area represents the link between the innovation
strategy and overall business goals. A firm may have an innovation strategy but the practices
of the explicit expression vary. An innovation strategy should also be a dynamic instrument
that shapes and guides innovation within a firm. It should be aligned with structures and
systems and match the strategic objectives.
The strategic leadership measurement area concerns leadership as a significant factor to make
innovation happen via a strong vision for innovation, a long-term commitment to innovation
and a clear allocation to resources. The behavior of senior managers is influential and the
leaders most likely to make innovation happen are those with a clear vision of the future
operation and direction of organizational change and creativity. These leaders should also
adopt an attitude tolerant to change and support attempts of new ways of doing things in a
different way, which creates the right climate for innovations to develop. Leaders must also
determine for themselves their expectations and understanding of the role of an innovation
champion and be aware of different person’s abilities to innovate.
2.3.4 Organization and culture
Organizational culture and structure concern the way staff are grouped and the organizational
culture within which they work. This category contains the two measurement areas culture
and structure, and is widely demonstrated that the perceived work environment (that
comprises both structural and cultural elements) does make a difference on the level of
innovations in an organization. For example, they need to be able to provide sufficient
freedom to allow for the exploration of creative possibilities, but sufficient control to manage
innovation in an effective and efficient way. Further, four main factors are generally agreed as
important for a team regarding cultural factors that are supportive to the innovation process.
These are (1) participative safety (how participative is the team in decision-making
procedures and how psychologically secure does the team feel about proposing new and
improved ways of doing things), (2) support for innovation (the degree of practical support for
innovation attempts contrasted with the pronounced support by senior management), (3)
vision (how clearly, defined, shared, attainable and valued are the team’s objectives and
11

<-----Page 19----->values), and (4) task orientation (the commitment of the team to achieve the highest possible
standards of task performance, including the constructive management of the progress oh
process). Also, the regularity of contact and communication within the project team has a
significant impact on innovative performance.
The need for freedom to experiment, where the innovation outcome not is under constraint, is
also an important factor for an innovative climate. Further, morale and motivation are also
dimensions of the innovative organization. Another aspect of culture is the propensity to take
risks. This propensity is rather described as the willingness to confront risky opportunities and
tolerate failure (and learn from doing so) than gambling carelessly.
2.3.5 Portfolio management
Portfolio management is important to the innovation outcome of an organization, due to the
rapidity at which resources are consumed in the innovation process and the need for these to
be managed. It is further proved that the effectiveness with which an organization manages its
R&D portfolio is a key determinant of its competitive advantage. The focus of portfolio
management is on making strategic, technological and resource choices that govern project
selection and the future shape of an organization. This category contains the two measurement
areas risk/return balance and optimization tool use.
A portfolio should be balanced in optimizing the trade-off between return and risk. The
process of selecting innovation projects requires evaluation and resource allocation under
certain conditions. It is argued that a systematic process guided by clear selection criteria can
help optimize the use of limited resources and enhance an organization’s competitive position.
The best performers have showed to use explicit formalized tools which are consistently
applied to all projects considered to belong to a portfolio. Other important factors when
evaluating projects are the alignment of the evaluation and selection procedure with the
innovation strategy and overall business objectives. Portfolio management is a measurement
area that is described in a broad sense. What factors that result in a well balanced portfolio is
not described more than that a company should take risk and return into account. Different
ways of weighting the portfolio may be beneficial depending of the company’s portfolio
strategy of choice but this is not elaborated on.
2.3.6 Project management
Project management is concerned with the processes that turn the inputs into a marketable
innovation. The innovation process is complex, comprising many events and activities, where
some of them may be identified as a sequence and where some of them occur concurrently.
Despite different viewpoints of how to model an innovation process regards if the events in
the processes occur in linearly sequential stages or whether events are more disorganized)
there are a number of common elements that can be summarized as the major components of
the innovation project management. These common elements represent the measurement
areas within this category, which are project efficiency, tools, communication and
collaboration.
The project efficiency measurement area concerns how fast an innovation reaches the market.
Innovation speed has been positively correlated with product quality or the degree to which it
satisfies customer requirements. To achieve efficiency, it is widely recommended that
organizations seeking to innovate should establish formal processes for innovating and make
use of tools and techniques that may facilitate innovation success. This is also what the
second measurement area tools concerns. The stage-gate process by Cooper (1990) is possibly
the most familiar among a wide range of tools – which all have in common the separation of
12

<-----Page 20----->the product development process into structured and discrete stages which each have
milestones, or quality control checkpoints at which stop/go decisions are made with regard to
the project progress.
The communications measurement area concerns the identified correlation between internal
communication and innovation. Internal communication facilitates the dispersion of ideas
within an organization, increases the diversity, and also contributes to the team climate. The
collaboration measurement area concerns the identified importance of collaborating with
suppliers and customers, since these parties can make important contributions to innovation
process.

2.4 Innovation strategy
An innovation strategy is an essential feature of the corporate strategy (Tidd and Bessant,
2009). According to Goffin and Mitchell (2010), it determines when and where innovation is
required to meet the aims of an organization and lays out in broad terms what actions is going
to be taken to achieve it. Further, Tang (1999) explains that an organization’s direction, goal
and success in innovation can be clearly traced to the organization’s innovation strategy –
which states the importance of applying one. Miles and Snow (1980), as cited by Hambrick
(2003), state that within an industry, there are more than one way to prosper and there are not
endless, but a handful of basic patterns that businesses can select from in order to achieve
their aims. One example, Craighead et al. (2009) defines four cost based innovation strategies;
Cost-efficient imitators, Cost-efficient innovators, Costly imitators, and Costly innovators.
These strategies are separated by their choice of actions given by two axes; (1) a firms aim to
either innovate and being first to bring new products to market or to imitate competitor’s
already successful products, or (2) relying on less costly versions of products or improved,
high quality, costly products (Craighead et al. 2009).
Another example on innovation strategies is presented by Stock and Zacharias (2011) that
depends on internal, external as well as boundary spanning factors. These innovation
orientations (strategies) are; Integrated Innovators, Internally driven preservers, Proactive
customer-oriented innovators and Top-down innovators. The integrated innovator faces high
environmental uncertainty and conducts intensive customer information acquisition activities.
Companies with this strategy have a way of adapting to the environment, which is effective
but also costly. Proactive customer-oriented innovators engage actively in customer
information acquisition and base their innovativeness mainly on customer preferences. These
companies are often very innovative and profitable. The Internally driven preserver’s
innovativeness is often structured and relies little on customer data. Low scores in financial
performance signify this strategy that often operates in a low environmental uncertainty. The
final strategy, Top-down innovators are not seen as very innovative though they perform well
in terms of finance. Emphasis is put on a few factors including structure and leadership and
their orientation is thought to fit their environment well. (Stock and Zacharias, 2011).
Miles and Snow’s (1980) work, as described by Hambrick (2003) includes four basic strategy
types that may populate the business landscape. Defenders are businesses that prosper through
stability, reliability, and efficiency. Prospectors prosper by stimulating and meeting new
product-market opportunities. Analyzers prosper by purposely being more innovative in their
product-market initiatives than Defenders, but doing so more cautiously and selectively than
Prospectors. Finally, Reactors vacillate in their approach to their environment and, as a result,
don't prosper at all.

13

<-----Page 21----->Further, Jaruzelski et al. (2012) have, in a consultancy report by Booze & Co, concluded that
there are different ways for organizations to compete on innovation strategy, and have
identified three generic ways of doing so. These three ways make organizations possible to
classify as Need seekers, Marker Readers or Technology drivers depending on innovation
strategy. The names derive from the way in which a company identifies opportunities that
may be turned into innovations; Need seekers rely on realizing sub-consious customer needs
to find ideas; Market readers take a more reactive approach and often adapt to changes in the
surrounding business environment (market) i.e. on competitors actions or law regulation;
while Technology drivers take a more introvert approach and base their innovations on new
R&D discoveries. (Jaruzelski et al. 2012)
Similarities may be seen in the strategy types defined by Stock and Zacharias (2011) and
Jaruzelski et al. (2012), regarding that a more introvert as well as a more customer oriented
innovation type is presented. Likewise, Jaruzelski et al. (2012) and Stock and Zacharias
(2011) both include the aspect of a company being more (1) proactive, by adopting a strategy
of being first to market, as well as (2) reactive, by following competitors and other forces of
the market. These aspects are what differentiates the Innovators from the Imitators, as
described by Stock and Zacharias (2011), as well as Market Readers from the other two
innovation strategy types as described by Jaruzelski et al. (2012). Similarly, the Prospectors
by Miles and Snow (1980) as described in Hambrick (2003) mainly respond to new market
needs more aggressively than Defenders and Analyzers and may thus be seen as more
proactive in their actions.
Though, Stock and Zacharias (2011) consider many aspects on which their presented
strategies are formed, there is information lacking regarding the strategies’ effect on the
innovation process, a factor elaborated on by Jaruzelski et al. (2012), where the strategy may
be noted in many stages and areas. Although, Jaruzelski et al. (2012) do not investigate the
rate to which the three identified strategies succeed (as Stock and Zacharias (2011) do) the
authors of this report found Need seeking, Market reading and Technology driving to be
easiest strategies to relate to from a practitioner’s perspective. Most important are also that,
Jaruzelski et al. (2012) clearly describe the affects that the three innovation strategies have on
the innovation process. Finally, these arguments are why the innovation strategies as
developed by Jaruzelski et al. (2012) were chosen as the innovation strategy framework to
proceed with.
2.4.1 Innovation strategies as presented by Jaruzelski et al. (2012)
As mentioned above, the innovation strategy concepts of Jaruzelski et al. (2012) are used as
the main framework. Jaruzelski et al. (2012) name companies that tend to follow different
innovation strategies as Need seekers, Market readers or Technology drivers and they have
concluded that almost all companies follow one of the three strategies to a further extent than
the other strategy types. These three types differ in the early stages of the innovation process
and have its own distinct way of managing the process and its relationship to customers and
the market. It is important to state that no one of them outperform the others, the critical
factors lie within how well an organization follows their chosen innovation strategy
(Jaruzelski et al. 2012). Further, these innovation strategies are not necessarily expressed as
being the strategy of a particular firm but are rather groupings, or clusters, of how firms
generally act to differentiate themselves in the competitive landscape.
Need seekers are companies that rely on customer observation and less on traditional market
research when developing new products. These companies rely on mechanisms that can
provide deep insights into the end-users of their products that go beyond observation of
14

<-----Page 22----->customers directly. Need seekers also depend more on customer focus groups and idea
brainstorm sessions than the other two categories and they also leverage social networking
and deep analytics involving customer data to a larger extent. Need seekers continuously
make use of internal networks, which means they have created a structure with cross-unit
staffing within projects and conducts formal idea conferences and events or communities of
practice etc. The Need seekers also tend to look at these kinds of structures and events as
more effective than the other categories. Externally, need seekers rely on networks of
customers, channel partners and suppliers and make use of these groups more continuously.
Need seekers tend to search widely for new ideas and work with large amounts of the same.
These kinds of companies also understand the importance of developing strong relationships
with their customers. (Jaruzelski et al. 2012)
Market readers tend to focus on the further development of products that have already been
introduced by competitors. These are companies with the goal to find ideas that lie within
their existing business expertise, and these ideas in turn are developed into incrementally
improved products that can be taken to market in a fast and efficient way. These kinds of
companies rely on traditional market research to understand better what is already working in
their current markets. A functioning feedback loop with ideas from customers, between sales
and R&D, is critical for Market readers as well as the ability to carry out incremental
improvements efficiently. Further, according to Jaruzelski et al. (2012), Market readers
depend less on networks of every kind than the other categories, which may result in a
negative effect of the sales/R&D feedback loop. Externally, Market readers depend on their
customer and supplier networks to a larger extent than the Technology drivers and to a less
extent in comparison to a Need seeker. Finally, Market readers are less likely to depend on
universities and government agencies for new ideas, than companies following either of the
other innovation strategies. (Jaruzelski et al. 2012)
Technology drivers are driven by their desire to develop new products based on the latest
advances in technology. These companies do take a more self-reliant and inward-looking
approach than the other two categories. The key for a Technology driver is to gain a broad
understanding of what is possible within new technology, and to use that understanding to
direct their own R&D function. They do also screen the market to intercept ideas and new
technology externally, but in general they use the external networks (such as customers,
channel partners and suppliers) less frequently than the other categories. Further, Technology
drivers depend to a greater extent than the other categories on internal mechanisms such as
regular meetings of their own experts and communities of practice across company business
units, to develop ideas that go beyond anything the market currently could suggest. The
consumers do not always know what is possible, which often means that Technology drivers
need to develop a product before they test the product on potential customers. A risk for a
Technology Driver is that its ideas and products, which reflect a highly technological
imperative, may not be fully attuned to markets. (Jaruzelski et al. 2012)

<-----Page 23----->3 METHODOLOGY
This chapter presents the research design, which was formed in accordance to the research
problem and objective. Briefly, a qualitative research approach was used, carried out through
in-depth interviews. Lastly, the limitations of the research and source criticism are discussed.

3.1 The research design
This research was executed with a qualitative research approach and has been following a
process made in several steps presented in Figure 1. The literature study and tool prototyping
was made iteratively through the process. The different phases are described below.

3.1.1 Literature study
A thorough literature study was carried to collect and examine existing knowledge within the
innovation field, and to choose a theoretical framework to use when interpreting and
analyzing the empirically collected data. Literature on research methodology was also studied
in order to facilitate the research design, as well as literature on audit and survey construction
to rely on when designing the tool. In accordance with recommendations by Corbin and
Strauss (2008), the literature study started with investigating broad concepts which was later
narrowed down.
The literature review consisted of data collected from secondary sources, mainly journal
articles (reached through the online databases Google Scholar and KTH Primo), books (from
the KTH library collection) and information collected from company websites.
3.1.2 Pre-study
The planning phase was initiated with an extensive literature study, as presented above. Along
with searching and reviewing the literature, meetings were held with the supervisor at ÅF and
at the Royal Institute of Technology in order to investigate, identify and elaborate on a
possible problem definition. The research was planned and a thesis proposal was written in
order to increase the potential for a successful study, which is in line with recommendations
by Collis and Hussey (2009). The thesis proposal included the proposed research problem, an
initial overview of the theoretical framework, the methodology as well as the time plan.

16

<-----Page 24----->3.1.3 Creation of a strategy dependent innovation framework prototype
In this phase, a prototype of a new innovation framework was created, which was based on
the literature review. A holistic innovation framework comprising of a structure that supports
innovation was chosen to form the main basis for the new framework. In accordance to the
literature review, innovation strategy was chosen as the contingency factor to consider in
making the framework more adaptable, thus more useful. An innovation strategy theory was
therefore merged with the holistic innovation framework and the result of this merger was the
strategy dependent innovation framework prototype. Motivations to the choices of the holistic
framework as well as the innovation strategy framework were presented in Chapter 2
Theoretical framework.
3.1.4 Interviews with case companies
To complement the theoretical base when designing the tool, and to secure usefulness of the
same, interviews were made with companies that are typical organizations that the tool is
aimed for. The main purposes of these interviews were to:





Get an understanding of how the companies think and reason about innovation and
how the concept is defined and used by practitioners. This in order to be able to design
a tool that is as understandable and as adapted as possible to practitioners.
Evaluate the innovation framework by Adams et al. (2006) in accordance to the
context of product companies and from the perspective of practitioners. This was done
by thoroughly going through the companies’ innovation processes and mapping the
areas that have been proven important and supportive to innovation within the
respective firm, and compare these with the framework.
Evaluate the relevance of the strategy framework by Jaruzelski et al. (2012). This was
carried out by investigating what insights and factors at each case company that
usually leads to and trigger innovations.

Five in-depth interviews were carried out with employees at companies whose principal
activity is product design and development of hardware products. This was also the main
selective criterion to be a company chosen for this study. The responding companies were
further selected due to their position as being ÅF’s largest customers and due to that their
operations include a high or medium level of advanced technology. The sample companies do
also have a reputation for adopting best practices in product innovation, which the authors of
this report see as an advantage when studying their innovation processes. All companies are
multinational with their R&D departments mainly located in Sweden. The respondents at the
companies, as well as their relevance for this study, are presented in Table 3.
The respondents at each company were chosen since they were operating on a managerial
level and were considered having the appropriate knowledge, expertise and experience. The
respondents were chosen through a dialogue with each company. All interviews were held
face-to-face at the respondents’ own locations and were limited to two hours. They were
conducted during March and April of 2013. The questions were mainly of open character,
which is relevant when an interviewer has the intention to explore and gather broad
information (Collis and Hussey, 2009).

The interviews were held in a semi-structured way, meaning that the main subject areas were
specified in advance but respondents were allowed to speak freely on the topics to share their
personal reflections (Westlander, 2000). According to Collis and Hussey (2009) semistructured interviews are appropriate when the aim is for the interviewer to develop an
understanding of the respondents “world” and the construct that the interviewee uses as a
basis for his/her answers, which was also the case in this research. The results from the
interviews are presented in Chapter 5 Empirical results.

18

<-----Page 26----->3.1.5 Interviews with ÅF
In order to get an understanding of the specific context which the tool may be used within and
to be able to design it in for usability, seven interviews were conducted at ÅF. The selected
respondents were holding positions as Key Account Managers (KAM) at ÅF, who are
responsible for a customer account each and whose main responsibilities are to optimize and
develop the sales process towards the customer. The KAMs were considered as main users of
the tool at ÅF, which made them relevant to interview. The KAMs that took part were also
responsible for the case companies in his study. Table 4 presents the interviewed KAMs.
Further, the results from the interviews are presented in Chapter 5 Empirical results.

Just as in the interviews with the case companies, the ÅF interviews were held in a semistructured way with open questions and pre specified topics on which the subjects were
allowed to speak freely on. An interview guide was used in order to keep the interviews
within the scope of this research, according to recommendations by Kvale (2007), but also to
ensure that the same type of data was collected from all respondents.
3.1.6 Analyses
The collected data from the interviews was processed and analyzed in a systematic manner,
according to recommendations by Collis and Hussey (2009). The authors of this report first
acquired a full understanding of the setting and study topic before conducting the interviews.
The data from the interviews was later sorted in different categories, or themes that reflected
the different topics that were explored. The categories were created according to the themes
presented in the theoretical framework of this report, but also other categories were formed to
categorize data that did not fit into to the predefined themes directly. Finally, the different
themes were analyzed with regards to possible links or patterns between the different
categories and the theory. The categories were also analyzed in regards to the research
questions for this thesis.
3.1.7 Revision of framework and the creation of the tool
In this phase, the strategy dependent innovation framework was revised in accordance to the
findings of the case company interviews. Based on this framework, the final audit tool was
created in accordance to the interviews with ÅF to secure usability. The final tool is presented
in Chapter 7 The tool design.

19

<-----Page 27----->3.2 Limitations
This study has limitations connected to the nature of interviewing and the time constraint:





As in all interviews there are risks, such as external factors (noise, environment etc.)
or such as biases and preconceptions at the interviewee that may have affected the
results from the interviews negatively (Collis and Hussey, 2009).
The authors of this report may not have the appropriate experience conducting semistructured interviews which may have limited the results of the conducted interviews.
The case companies represent a wide area of industries where different conditions
affect the way in which they are structured and operate. These facts limit the
comparisons made between their answers.
Only five case companies were interviewed which may not represent the general
opinions and actions of all product development (PD) companies.
Only one or two managers at each case company were interviewed which may not
represent the general opinions and actions of each company.

3.3 Trustworthiness
Both primary and secondary sources were used during this study. A description of the two
source types are treated below.
3.3.1 Primary and secondary sources
In order to increase the level of trustworthiness of the interviews, the interviewed companies
got the opportunity to be anonymous. Before each interview, the interview template was sent
to the respondents in order for them to prepare. This was also done to assure that the right
persons at the companies, with relevant and valuable viewpoints for the study, answered the
questions. The published texts from the interviews have also been reviewed by the
respondents to confirm its validity.
The used secondary sources were mainly obtained from well-known journals, databases and
form established researchers, in order to ensure a valid study result. The main body of
literature is up-to-date but a small range of articles is of an older fashion, where the latter are
mainly related to theoretical definitions. Further, the literature framework was based on wellaccepted definitions and typology stated in previous literature.
3.3.2 Reliability, validity and generalizability
According to Collis and Hussey (2009), a research result is reliable if other researchers may
repeat it and obtain the same result. For a qualitative research, reliability is often hard to
achieve since it is dependent on a particular context, and are often based of biased
interpretations made by one or different investigators (Collis and Hussey, 2009). The
qualitative results in this research therefore may be biased given our perception of the
problem.
Validity is the extent to which the research findings accurately reflect the phenomena under
study, and is often seen as high in a qualitative research (Collis and Hussey, 2009). This is
probably also the case in this qualitative investigation.
Generalization is the extent to which the research findings may be extended to other cases or
to other settings (Collis and Hussey, 2009). In order to increase the level of generalizability it
is important to describe the context of the research and under what circumstances it was done
20

<-----Page 28----->(Merriam, 1995). This was done previously in this methodology chapter. The authors of this
report find the analysis and results of this research applicable to organizations in the same
situation as ÅF and that have the intention to conduct an external innovation audit on PD
companies.

<-----Page 29----->4 ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
The aim of this section is to take the initial step in the design of a strategy dependent
innovation framework. The framework is designed through a merger between the holistic
innovation framework by Adams et al. (2006) and the theories on innovation strategy by
Jaruzelski et al. (2012).

4.1 The merging of two frameworks as solution
The first research question in this report deals with the need to design a strategy dependent
innovation framework. Such a framework is meant to be used for an innovation audit tool; a
tool that in turn takes into account the important aspect of an organizations’ need of different
and adapted innovation structures depending on their respective strategy of innovation. These
structures (that depend on an organization’s innovation strategy) need different support within
the innovation process and therefore need to be audited differently.
The holistic innovation framework by Adams et al. (2006) forms the foundation of the new
framework to be designed. The relevance of using Adams et al.’s (2006) framework as a basis
has been argued for in Chapter 2.3 A holistic innovation framework. Adams et al.’s
framework (2006) represents the fundamentals – the “must haves” – in the new strategy
dependent innovation framework, consisting of the universal structure that all companies need
in order to give their innovation process and practices the best prerequisites to succeed. On
top of that, the new strategy dependent innovation framework includes three different parts
that depend on a company’s innovation strategy, i.e. how companies choose to compete
through innovation on the market. These different parts are based on the innovation strategy
classifications by Jaruzelski et al. (2012) and will depend on if the company audited is
classified as a Need seeker, Market reader or a Technology driver. By using this updated
strategy dependent innovation framework as a basis for an audit – the audit will hopefully be
able to generate a more accurate and useful analysis due to that it is more adapted to the
specific company than other existing audits on the market.
4.1.1 The design process
The designing of the strategy dependent innovation framework is made by:
1. Identifying the specific behaviors and actions (the characteristics) related to each of
the three innovation strategy classifications; Need seeker, Market reader or a
Technology driver, that need to be considered in the framework. This is carried out
based on Chapter 2.4 Innovation strategy.
2. Identifying the processes and structures that must be in place in order to follow the
behaviors and actions related to each of the three strategy dependent company
classifications. This is described in Chapter 4.2 Processes in need of support by the
new framework, below.
3. Applying these processes and structures on the holistic innovation framework by
Adams et al. (2006) and make adjustments within the measurement areas of the same
in order to adapt it towards the different strategy dependent company classifications.
This is done in Chapter 4.3 The strategy dependent innovation framework.

22

<-----Page 30----->4.2 Processes in need of support by the new framework
The characteristics of a Need seeker, Market reader or Technology driver are described in
Chapter 2.4 Innovation strategy. These characteristics were transformed into related structures
and processes that need to be in place in order to follow the behaviors and actions related to
each of the three strategy dependent company classifications. These processes and structures
are presented in Table 5 below and are later applied on the holistic innovation framework by
Adams et al. (2006), in order to be considered in the strategy dependent framework.

how to conduct customer observation efficiently but more critical is to
find structures that go beyond the direct observation of customers
how to identify mechanisms that can provide deep insights into the
end-users of their products,
how to handle customer focus groups and idea brainstorming sessions
(internally and with customers),
how to encourage social networking internally and make use of
internal networks,
how to secure a generation of a large amount of ideas and conduct
formal idea generation events,
how to collaborate and network with external parties, such as networks
of customers, channel partners etc., and
how to create conditions for the effective usage of innovation
champions.
how to carry out incremental improvements efficiently and secure
short time to market,
how to conduct traditional market research to understand better what is
already working in current markets and what products that are already
introduced by competitors,
how to secure a functioning feedback loop with ideas from customers,
between sales and R&D, and internal communities and networks for
quick idea generation, and
how to collaborate and network with external parties, such as networks
of customers, channel partners etc.
how to develop new products based on the latest advances in
technology,
how to make use of internal networks and mechanisms, such as
meetings, communities across business units to develop ideas, and
how to collaborate and network with external parties, such as
universities and research institutes, but also to a less extent customers
and channel partners.

23

<-----Page 31----->4.3 The strategy dependent innovation framework
The characteristics related to each of the three strategy dependent company classifications
reflect actions and procedures that are mainly related to the first stage in the innovation
process described by Koen et al. (2001), i.e. the Opportunity identification stage. It regards
what strategies different companies adopt when seeking insights and opportunities that are
meant to lead to innovation. This kind of insights and opportunities are related to some kind
of knowledge or information, which makes it a relevant statement that the measurement
category of Knowledge management are the area most affected by a merger of the two
frameworks. Although, later stages in the innovation process are indirectly affected by the
different actions and characteristics related to Need seekers, Market readers or Technology
drivers.
Therefore, modifications and adjustments are primarily made within the Knowledge
management category, but also smaller adjustments are made within the categories: Inputs
management, Organization and culture, Portfolio management and Project management.
Further, no adjustments will be made within the Strategy implementation and usage category.
The adjustments of the holistic innovation framework by Adams et al. (2009) to the three
strategy dependent company classifications are discussed and described below. These are also
presented in Table 6.
4.3.1 Adjustments on Inputs management
The Inputs management category concerns people that are committed to the innovation task
(Adams et al. 2006) within a firm and emphasizes individual’s different propensities to
innovate. Individuals are different when it comes to e.g. their motivation to change,
challenging behavior, and preferred approach to work etc., as described in Chapter 2.3.1. For
a Need seeker, it is important to create a structure that supports a special kind of personality –
the innovation champions (Adams et al. 2006). Having access to individuals with this kind of
behavior is critical for success. Within the People measurement area, the structure for a Need
seeker therefore needs to be extra complemented with a structure that supports the behavior of
these innovation champions.
4.3.2 Adjustments on Knowledge management
The Knowledge management category is affected by the Need seeker, Market reader or
Technology driver behaviors in several measurement areas. The Idea generation measurement
area emphasizes the importance of securing a large amount of ideas and that all employees are
involved in the idea generation activities in the fundamental structure. These areas are vital
for a Need seeker as well, but what differentiates the Need seekers within this area is the
importance of creating a structure that supports formal process for idea generation, where an
example could be to conduct large systematic idea generation events. Further, it is also
particularly important for a Need seeker to involve the customers in the idea generation; this
factor should therefore also be emphasized in the adapted framework for Need seekers.
Within the Knowledge repository measurement area, there must be a clear focus for a Need
seeker on collecting specifically customer information and data – especially to explore the
sub-conscious needs of the customers. For a Market reader, the focus is on collecting
knowledge meant for macro analysis, i.e. knowledge regarding competitors, the industry, or
law regulations etc. For the Technology driver, there is a focus on getting knowledge about
the latest advances in appropriate technology easily accessible and available when needed.

24

<-----Page 32----->The structures for collaboration and communication with customers in particular, are
significant for a Need seeker in order to grasp appropriate customer knowledge and
information, and should therefore be added within the Information flows measurement area,
where linkages with external sources are included. This factor is also important for Market
readers, but to a less extent than the Need seekers and to a larger extent than the Technology
drivers. Another significant structure to add to the Market reader specific framework within
the Information flows measurement area regards the feedback loop with ideas from customers,
between sales, R&D and the market division within a company – as that enhances the success
of a short lead time and incremental improvements. For the Technology driver, Information
flows are particularly important internally, since these organizations often rely on new
technology developed within the organization. Although, these organizations also often have
strong links to universities and other research institutes which means these external structures
are important as well.
4.3.3 Adjustments on Organization and culture
The Organization and culture category concern the way staff are grouped and the
organizational culture within which they work (Adams et al. 2006). These areas have high
significance for Need seekers, in the sense that they encourage the creation of innovations
mainly through social networking internally – which is primarily a question of company
culture. Structures aimed at making use of internal networks are important and needs to be
considered in the adapted framework for Need seekers. The importance of encouraging
innovation champions, as mentioned within the Inputs management category are also related
to this measurement area. For a Technology driver, the culture aspect is important when it
comes to the supporting structure of intrapreneurs, since these are often driving innovations
internally.
Regarding the structure measurement area, this aspect is important to Market readers since
such organizations must create a culture where the focus is on efficient incremental
innovation and short time to market.
4.3.4 Adjustments on Portfolio management
No large adaptions towards Need seekers are made within this category. Although, it is
important to emphasize that Need seekers must be customer driven in all their operations,
which affect the framework for these companies.
4.3.5 Adjustments on Project management
The Project management category treats the processes that turn the inputs into a marketable
innovation. The project efficiency measurement area is concerned with the effective
management of innovation related projects. For Market readers, this aspect is significant since
their success lies to a large extent on effective incremental development and short time to
market of development projects.
The communications measurement area includes the identified correlation between internal
communication and innovation. This is a significant area for Need seekers that is also
emphasized, and related, to the conclusions drawn under the category Organization and
culture regarding the importance of social networking. Important for Need seekers are also to
work in cross-functional teams in order to take advantage of a climate with different
competences – this is proven to be advantageous for the generation of innovation and a part of
a Need seeker’s strategy. For Market readers and Technology drivers, this is important
regarding the mentioned aspects under the Knowledge management category - the efficient
25

<-----Page 33----->feedback loop for Market readers as well as the importance of internal collaboration for
Technology drivers.
The collaboration measurement area states the identified importance of collaborating with
suppliers and customers, and other external parties since these parties can make contributions
to innovation process. This is important for Need seekers since they rely on developing strong
relationships with their customers particularly, as well as for Market readers. For Technology
drivers, this is also particularly important regarding the common dependence of research
institutes and universities in an early stage when developing new technology.
All adaptions done to the Adams et al.’s (2006) framework are presented in Table 6 below.

In this chapter the results from the empirical study, i.e. the interviews with the case
companies as well as ÅF KAMs, are compiled.

5.1 Interviews with the case companies
Five of ÅF’s largest customer accounts are the product based companies Company A,
Company B, Company C, Company D and Company E. These companies are all potential
subjects for the audit tool being developed which is why representatives from the different
firms were interviewed. The aim of the interviews was to understand their approach to the
field of innovation as well as confirming, and possibly adapting, the framework prototype
designed. The results from the interviews with the five case companies are presented in Table
7 and Table 8 below. Complementary text and findings are presented afterwards.

Perspectives on
innovation strategy and
insights to innovation/
innovation triggers

There are product
portfolio strategies
which are set on the so
called “new generation
planning meetings” on
a yearly basis.
Much resource is put on
traditional market
analysis and law
regulations are highly
influencing the
innovation process at
Company A.

An innovation strategy
exists. The main
triggers of innovation
are internal technology
development and the
customers’ needs.
Market analysis is done
e.g. including scanning
of existing patents that
may be of interest.

A part of the overall
company strategy is
to have an increased
focus on innovation.
Technology is critical
for the metal cutting
industry which is why
new R&D discoveries
are the main trigger of
an innovation.

There is not a clearly
stated innovation
strategy. Company E
forecasts future market
and customer needs in a
process called
“Technology
Road Map” (TRM),
which is used for R&D.
Following laws
regulations have big
impact on the innovation
process, i.e. is a main
trigger.

The innovation process

The innovation process
starts with relating the
product to the product
portfolio strategy. This
is followed by a
feasibility study and
brainstorm phase where
ideas are developed and
chosen. The next
iterated steps are
prototyping and testing.

The company has
clearly stated objectives
when it comes to rolling
out innovations more
effectively and making
money on innovation.
There are many insights
that trigger the
innovation process, e.g.
the customer spoken
needs, law regulations
and new competitor
launches. Customers
are carefully studied in
order to detect their
unspoken needs.
An opportunity goes
through the four steps:
(1) idea generation and
selection, where
brainstorming occurs,
(2) testing, which
includes concept
modeling, (3) concept
selection, where
prototypes are made
and a concept is
selected, and (4)
integration, where the
concept is integrated
into a product.

Technology evaluation
is a brainstorming
phase where you look at
the possibilities with a
technological
discovery. Proof of
concept includes the
prototyping and testing
of the technology or
concept. This is
followed by a research
project that develops
the concept further.
Extensive internal
processes exist due to
the nature of a large
multinational firm.

Company D are not
very familiar with the
explicit term
innovation process,
and a formal process
for the early stages of
the innovation process
does therefore not
exist. Generally, when
an inventor comes up
with an idea he
discusses it with his
manager, reports the
idea, check for
patents, makes
prototypes and tests it.
Collaborations with
universities exist.

Three phases exists
before industrialization;
(1) Research, (2)
Advanced engineering
and (3) Concept
development. The first
two phases are carried out
through collaborating
with universities,
research institutes and/or
competitors. Company E
carry out concept
development itself,
including prototyping and
testing.

Having access to
relevant, correct and
updated information to
base informed decisions
on is important within
the management of the
project portfolios. Tools
such as appropriate
computer software,
steering documents,
checklists etc. also
support the innovation
process. Company A
are also dependent on
the information flow of
ideas from customers,
via sales people, to the
development
departments, in order to
secure that the right
products are developed
for its customers.

It is important that
structured workshops
and brainstorming
sessions are held crossfunctionally and to
involve people in teams
that have a stimulating
effect on each other.
Good communication,
provocation and stimuli
are important factors
throughout the
innovation process. A
for innovation
supporting company
culture is a prerequisite
e.g. that permeates all
kinds of ideas.

Generating many ideas
in the beginning of the
innovation process
have been showed to be
a success factor as well
as involving people
with the “right
mindset” in
brainstorming
activities. Further,
allowing the employees
free time (and indirect a
budget) to spend on
own, smaller internal
research projects are
success factors for
innovation.

New knowledge builds
upon old knowledge
which is why
knowledge sharing is
emphasized. It is
important to have a
structure that allows
people to talk about
their ideas and that
supports intrapreneurs,
as well as having a
structure that supports
less innovative people
to drive through their
ideas. Giving time and
a budget for internal
projects is a driver of
innovation. Motivated
employees have also
shown being an
important prerequisite
for innovation. Further,
leaders bear a large
responsibility for
creating the right
conditions for
innovation.

The people are seen as
the most valuable
source at Company E
and to have motivated
employees working
cross-functional are
therefore an important
aspect in the innovation
process. Possessing the
appropriate knowledge,
preferably product
knowledge is a
prerequisite at
Company E for a
positive outcome of
innovation. Company E
also mentions the ability
to understand its
customers’ (the drivers)
situation when
developing new ideas
and solutions.

30

<-----Page 38----->5.1.1 Perspectives on innovation strategy and insights to innovation
Concerning the presence of an innovation strategy at the companies, the answers varied much
and only Respondent C at Company C had chosen to explicitly use the word innovation
strategy. A wide variety of approaches, aimed at creating the right conditions for innovation
were adopted and present among the companies interviewed. Some approaches, or actions
were systematized, some non-systematized, and some partially systematized. When the open
question was asked regarding what triggers an innovation (or what give rise to a new idea) –
the most common answers were possible to categorize into one or several of the following
main areas that may trigger an innovation:







an insight of a customer’s stated or sub-conscious needs,
an insight raised after studying and forecasting the potential future
conditions/needs of the customers, as well as the current industry and its supply
chain (including supplier and channel partners),
an insight from a new R&D discovery,
an insight raised due to law regulations, and
an insight raised from a competitor’s launch of a new product or function.

Further, all of the interviewed companies mentioned insights from customers stated needs as a
main trigger for an innovation. The respondent at Company B said that they do work a lot
with these issues and has introduced an “i-lab” (innovation-lab), which is an office space built
and reserved for brainstorming with customers. Company B uses several approaches
systematically by having processes for collaborating with customers, using market
intelligence as well as for reacting to competitor’s acts and law regulations. At Company E
ideas are rather found in structured ways than through brainstorming according to Respondent
E. Laws and regulations do also have a large impact on the innovation process at Company E
where 60% of the R&D budget is driven by following sound and emission regulations.
At Company D, the insights that lead to innovations differ depending on the novelty of the
innovation.
“Radical innovations are most commonly built upon identified customer needs
(…) while technology development [the incremental innovation process at
Company D] is more about discoveries within R&D (…) and in those cases [when
incremental innovations are born] the ideas come from within the company.”
Respondent D, Company D
Further, Respondent A at Company A elaborates around the fact that Company A often
possesses more advanced technology and expertise that their customers expect and are willing
to pay for. He states that the business in general is traditional which have led to that Company
A puts much resources on traditional market analysis to find out about what the customers
desires today.
“We work too little with the sub-conscious needs of our customers (…) often we
follow the customers’ stated needs straight away, which leads to customer orders
that we build straight after their demands without reflecting over if we may
provide them [the customers of Company A] with a better solution that they are
not aware of exists.”
Respondent A, Company A
31

<-----Page 39----->5.1.2 The innovation process
All the responding companies had matured product development processes and similar
procedures were adopted regarding the industrialization of a product. Although, the process
that comes before industrialization (the early innovation process) did differ between the
companies, as well as to what extent the process was formalized.
The technological innovation process at Company B is called Advanced development (AD)
and exists within all product categories and it is a part of Company B’s R&D organization.
“The purpose with AD is to reduce technical risks and not in the first hand to
design for efficient manufacturing or cost efficiency (…) the AD should prove that
something is working, but as important is also to prove that something is not
working. AD therefore has a high failure rate in comparison to the industrializing
process [the product development process].”
Respondent B1, Company B
Respondent C at Company C and Respondent A at Company A are largely aligned with the
innovation process at Company B though the phases have different names. Company E and
Company D differentiate from the rest of the companies studied where Company E has a
process that involves research in collaboration with universities or research institutes and
Company D does not have a formalized process per se.
5.1.3 Prerequisites for innovation
The responding companies were asked to elaborate freely on what prerequisites that must be
in place in order to stimulate innovation the most. The respondents were elaborating around
identified key success factors when an innovation had succeeded. There are many
commonalities in the answers received though emphasis is put on different aspects between
the respondents. According to Respondent B1 at Company B, it is important to have
provocation and stimuli through collaboration (often with external parties) and cross
functionality. Though cross-functional decision making occur on all case companies, it is not
expressed as being as important as on Company B.
At Company C the importance of having a process in the ideation phase is emphasized:
“We try working like a funnel. From many ideas and then to narrow down”
Respondent C, Company C
The same approach can be seen at Company B where “i-jams” (innovation jams) are executed
that engage all Company B employees to generate thousands of ideas together according to
Respondent B2.
Further, having access to correct and updated information to base decisions on, is an area that
all respondents touched upon though Respondent A at Company A strongly emphasized this
point. A high knowledge level is also deemed as important by the responding companies.
Respondent D at Company D mentioned that the company possesses a lot of knowledge
within its field and is in the forefront of the technology.
The respondents were further elaborating around the right resources needed in order to carry
out successful prototyping and testing. A well-equipped lab, the right tools and equipment
such as 3D printers are mentioned here. Also, the right supportive software is of importance
according to Respondent A at Company A.

32

<-----Page 40----->Further, the respondents at Company E, Company D and Company B do highlight that the
people at the respective companies play the most important role in the success of the
company.
“What I have noticed is that which drives success [in product development
processes] the most is that you believe in your idea and that you are almost
“willing to die” for it.”
Respondent D, Company D
Respondent D at Company D further explains about a portable creative environment that the
employees can set up when they want to “be creative” and that they have a system developed
for registering people’s ideas internally in order to track who came up with what idea if patent
registration would be of relevance. Several respondents also mention the time aspect as an
important prerequisite for exploring and fulfilling an idea, as well as the importance of set
aside financial resources for smaller projects with no specific goal.

5.2 Interviews with ÅF
The results from the seven interviews with ÅF Key Account Managers (KAMs) are presented
below.
5.2.1 Input on tool design and usage
The KAMs were asked for input and specific requirements regarding the design and usage of
the tool, in order to secure the usability of the same and its fit into a sales organization. There
is consensus between the KAMs that a main requirement of the tool is that it should be simple
and understandable. If customers do not understand the terminology in the tool, it could result
in less truthful answers or that the customers become fed up according to Henric Flöjs, KAM
for Company A. Having an explanatory text in the survey was also something seen as useful.
It is strongly emphasized that using the tool cannot be too time consuming, either for the
KAM or the customer concerned. Using the tool, if it is structured as a survey, must be
possible within a time frame of one hour, which is the time of a regular meeting according to
Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company A. Cecilia Dreijer, KAM for Company B further explain
that the lack of time at the customer’s work places is a constraint, and few managers at ÅF’s
customers are willing to take too much time for surveys or interviews from themselves or
their respective staff.
Regarding what target respondent the KAMs believe the tool is appropriate for it is stated that
such a tool is most useful when executed on development managers, but conducting it on
lower levels might also be an idea according to Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company A. Cecilia
Dreijer, KAM for Company B adds that it would not be possible to meet a whole team at once
for questioning. Further, on the subject of using the tool:
“I believe that it could be possible to have a survey distributed to several
managers – within at least the R&D and the Market divisions – or employees via
e-mail (…) other parties that would be of relevance [to interview/respond a
survey] are the process owners, but it is also depending on the size and
organization of the customer.”
Jacob Rydholm, KAM for Company C
The KAMs also had opinions on how the tool could be used by the sales team at ÅF. Using a
tool within a sales organization is a matter on which the whole sales team at each customer
33

<-----Page 41----->account must be coordinated around, according to Pia Lagerlöf, KAM for Company D.
Several KAMs also elaborate around a two-step approach where the first step (possibly a
survey) may be free of charge but the second step (maybe an in-depth analysis) could be
charged for. A two-step approach is necessary according to Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company
A and Pia Lagerlöf, KAM for Company D, because it would definitely make the customers
reflect more. Although, any kind of analysis needed between two potential steps should not be
too time consuming and complex if done manually. There was consensus that an
electronically based tool that takes care of any kind of analysis was preferred.
Further, a point that all KAMs agreed upon was the possibility of using the tool as an
interview template, if designed as a survey. This would probably generate more reliable
answers according to the KAMs. To just send a survey electronically to a customer is also
considered bad from a sales perspective.
“I think a lot of it [appropriate answers] comes from a dialogue rather than a
questionnaire. Some [respondents] are timid, some are proud. Are you honest in a
survey? If you do not have a dialogue, people will lie easier (…) the tool should
rather be a conversation template.”
Jacob Rydholm, KAM for Company C
It is agreed that the KAMs should be able to choose how to integrate a tool into the sales
process him/herself, depending on the relationship with the customer. A workshop with all the
KAMs could be a good way of learning how the tool works and may be used according to
Jacob Rydholm, KAM for Company C.
To conclude, all KAMs state that it is important to have a win-win situation when using a tool
like this. The purpose must be clear towards the customer and it is important to create an
interest at the customer to learn more about innovation and its own organization. Further, to
use the tool must sound positive when it is presented for the customers and not negative
(which may be the case if e.g. the communicated aim is to just point out where the customers
have deficiencies).

<-----Page 42----->6 ANALYSIS
In this chapter, the empirical results are analyzed, compared with theory and discussed. First,
the fundamental framework by Adams et al. (2006) is dealt with and – as a result of the
discussion – the revisions to the fundamental innovation framework are presented. Later and
the innovation strategy framework by Jaruzelski et al. (2012) is dealt with. Lastly, the
usability requirements for the tool are set.

6.1 Evaluation of the fundamental innovation framework
Below, the chosen fundamental innovation framework by Adams et al. (2006) is evaluated in
accordance to the context of the responding companies. The structure and factors that support
innovation as illustrated by Adams et al. (2006) (i.e. the categories Inputs management,
Knowledge management, Strategy implementation and usage, Organization and culture,
Portfolio management and Project management) are compared with the results from the case
company interviews.
6.1.1 Inputs management
The inputs management category includes a broad perspective on the inputs needed for
successful innovation, and consists of the categories: people, physical and financial
resources, and tools. The measurement area was to a large extent confirmed by the case
company interviews but some findings need to be discussed.
The people measurement area includes the difference in individuals in terms of demography
as well as preferred way of working, experience and education (Adams et al. 2006). These
diversity related prerequisites were all confirmed by the case companies. Company B
emphasizes the aspects of contrasts, stimuli and provocation as important for innovation to
occur, which come with diversity and are therefore related to the diversity prerequisite
according to the authors of this report. This is further seen as the reason for why Company B
focuses on e.g. cross functional teams and collaboration, a structure that goes hand in hand
with the content in the Organization and culture and Project management categories. The
importance of employees having the appropriate knowledge and education is strongly
emphasized by the case companies.
A matter not stated in the literature, though strongly emphasized by Company E and
Company D is the importance of having motivated employees as an input for succeed with
innovation. Further, Adams et al. (2006) state that people have different propensities to
innovate which is clear at Company D where structures are set up to support people with
different propensities to drive projects – something which is by the author interpreted as an
attempt to support employees to become intrepreneurs.
Physical and financial resources and tools, are broad measurement areas that capture a range
of inputs from buildings to computer equipment (Adams et al. 2006), and similarities were
found between the framework and the empirical results. It is in phases of prototyping and
testing that the case companies mainly see tools as effective. Company D as well as Company
C use slack resources as a tool for innovation just as Adams et al. (2006). The author of the
report argue that it is intuitive that resources in terms of facilities, software and time are
needed in order to have successful innovation within an organization. Though there seems to
be a must-have level of resources and there are companies that stand out by having specific

35

<-----Page 43----->idea rooms (Company B), a portable creative environment (Company D) and slack time
(Company C and Company D).
Financial resources is an area where few elaborated answers were attained from the
interviews. At Company D and Company C it is seen as important to give inventors a budget
for own identified and smaller internal projects but there is little willingness throughout the
interviews to discuss finance more in detail than in wide comparisons between different areas.
Although more specific details should be possible to obtain by investigating and analyzing
each company’s annual report, but this is not considered necessary since there are no
specifications in neither Adams et al.’s (2006) nor Jaruzelski et al.’s (2012) frameworks that
elaborates on the amount of finance needed to succeed with innovations. Thus, this is not
seen as a problem for the tool and is less emphasized in the revised framework.
6.1.2 Knowledge management
The knowledge management category is concerned with obtaining and communicating ideas
and information that underlie innovation competencies and includes the measurement areas
idea generation, knowledge repository and information flows.
Regarding the idea generation (internal and external) measurement area, Adams et al. (2006)
state the importance of generating and evaluating a large number of ideas. This is widely
agreed throughout the empirical interviews. Company C see their innovation process as a
funnel where it is important to generate many ideas in the beginning and then to narrow it
down to a few as the process progresses. Company B hold “i-jams” internally, when
thousands of ideas are generated. Further, Company B rely on a clear structure for
brainstorming, which is not carried across explicitly by Adams et al. (2006). Further at
Company A, idea generation is seen as most effective when it is aligned with the different
product portfolios and must be carried out with an appropriate knowledge base to be efficient.
People with the right mindset may trigger the idea generation process and should be involved,
as done at Company C. It may be mentioned that several aspects mentioned above are to some
extent connected to one or more categories in the Adams et al. (2006) framework. Having a
structured innovation process for brainstorming is related to organization and culture and
Company A clearly connects ideation with product portfolio management. The authors of this
report mean that this in turn makes the added comments to the revised framework more
credible.
The knowledge repository measurement area refers to the importance of measuring the
accumulated knowledge of a firm since it is fundamental to innovation, to combine new and
existing knowledge, and to make use of new knowledge and recognize the value of the same
Adams et al. (2006). As interpreted from the case company interviews, knowledge is an
important aspect, though still fuzzy, which is why measuring the accumulated knowledge is
not emphasized in the revised framework. This is also due to that the authors of this report
conclude that it is too complex and not applicable from the practitioner’s perspective.
Although, storing of knowledge is mentioned as important aspects for enhancing innovative
behavior by Company E, Company D and Company B. These companies also mean that it is
important to have structures for storing knowledge (maybe on a database) and to make it
accessible.
The information flows measurement area is concerned with the importance of linkages
between the innovating group and external parties, Adams et al. (2006). All case companies
describe linkages to external organizations. Company D and Company E have close linkages
to universities and suppliers and Company E also conduct research projects with competitors.
All companies value their contacts with customers highly, which is generally seen as one of
36

<-----Page 44----->the key success factors for innovative performance. Further, it is elaborated on Company A on
the importance of the relevant type of knowledge to be collected in order to enhance the
innovative behavior, e.g. market and macro information.
6.1.3 Strategy implementation and usage
The strategy implementation and usage category includes the measurement areas strategic
orientation and strategic leadership. Strategic orientation is concerned with the innovation
strategy’s alignment to the organization’s overall strategy (Adams et al. 2006). The case
companies’ answers regarding their innovation strategies differed to a large extent. Though
most answers could be related to a form of product strategy, the connection to Adams et al.’s
(2006) definition of innovation strategy was weak and the explicit term innovation strategy
was only used at Company C though it was unclear to which extent it is spread within the
organization. At Company B there are “innovation goals”, and at Company D there is an
“innovation focus” as a part of their overall strategy. Given the ambiguous answers received
when asking the customers about their innovation strategy, it has been interpreted that this
field (though it may be important) is difficult to convey to the customers and will therefore be
paid less attention in the revised framework. Hence, this is seen as a discrepancy between the
practitioner and the academic perspectives within the field of innovation.
The strategic leadership measurement area concerns leadership as a significant factor to make
innovation happen via a strong vision for innovation (Adams et al. 2006). This area is not as
much considered in the empirical results as in the theory. The empirical results show that only
Company D explicitly sees leadership as an area important for creating an innovative
environment and for providing the employees with appropriate resources and structures.
Company D also stresses the importance of leaders to understand different individuals’
propensities to innovate and the role of an innovation champion, which is in accordance to
Adams et al. (2006). Company B has embraced the importance of spreading the vision about
innovation among employees, by introducing an innovation initiative.
6.1.4 Organization and culture
The organization and culture category concern the way the staff are grouped and the
organizational culture within which they work (Adams et al. 2006) and consist of the
measurement areas culture and structure. An innovation culture is, by Adams et al. (2006),
described as a culture that allows for sufficient freedom to let employees explore ideas but
enough control to be efficient. This structure was seen at both Company D and Company C
where time is allocated for employees to use freely for exploration of own ideas. Company C
further strives for reducing the many processes, which are common at large multinational
companies and which may hamper innovative behavior. Cross-functionality is another
dimension described as a part of an innovation culture (Adams et al. 2006) that Company B
has embraced on many levels of the innovation process, such as in the decision making and
within the idea generation phase.
6.1.5 Portfolio management
The portfolio management category consists of the measurement areas risk/return balance
and optimization tool use. The process of selecting innovation projects requires evaluation and
resource allocation under uncertain conditions (Adams et al. 2006). According to the
empirical results, all companies interviewed consider a formal process aimed for portfolio
management as important, though it was obvious during the interviews that the extent to
which this is done with success, varies. At Company B the importance of becoming better
within the field was expressed. Company A has incorporated portfolio management into the
37

<-----Page 45----->first step in its innovation process; Pre-study and portfolio analysis. This process includes
aligning the portfolio with market analysis to find where new or updated products may be
needed. Overall it can be understood that this is an area that many of the case companies
consider but find hard to approach as there are no universal tools to ease the process with.
This may be the result of the uncertain conditions Adams et al. (2006) mention which the
decision must be made on in this phase.
6.1.6 Project management
The project management category is concerned with the process that turns the inputs into
marketable innovation (Adams et al. 2006) and consists of the measurement areas project
efficiency, tools, communication and collaboration.
Efficient project management concerns how fast an innovation reaches the market and goes
hand in hand with having a formal process for managing innovation projects (Adams et al.
2006). As described in the empirical results of the case company interviews, the process
structure most commonly followed includes (1) Opportunity identification, (2) Idea
generation and selection, (3) Prototyping and (4) Testing. The process is often referred to as a
gateway process which is similar to what Adams et al. (2006) refer to as the separation of the
product development process into structures and discrete stages, which each have milestones
in the form of quality control checkpoints. The overall processes at the companies have clear
commonalities in its structure though smaller changes are made perhaps in order to adapt the
process to the company’s internal or external situation.
The tools measurement area is by Adams et al. (2006) exemplified as CAD or CAM programs
and goes hand in hand with the tools measurement area in the inputs management category.
The clear relation between the two areas was noted during the interviews as the each company
answered in very similar ways to both tool measurement areas. On the other hand, the
different companies’ answers differed a lot from each other. For example, Company A use
steering documents, product specifications and checklists to keep the innovation process
efficient along with the timeframe and budgets on previous projects which acts as a base.
In the communications measurement area, Adams et al. (2006) have identified internal
communication to have a positive relationship with innovation and that it can be measured in
terms of number of meetings or committees as well as to what extent suppliers are consulted.
The empirical interviews showed no significant difference in answers between the
measurement areas “communication” and “information flows” and no additional comment
were added by either of the companies. This is thought to be an effect of the similarities
between the areas. I was understood that the aspect of sharing information in general was seen
as important for the innovation process.
Collaboration is perhaps the second measurement area where the interviewed companies are
widely engaged in many different areas. Company B often invites customers, suppliers and
universities to have a collaborative brainstorm. Company A collaborates with their customers
by testing their rigs or modules in the mines of their customers in order to get feedback.
Customer collaboration is something mentioned by all companies interviewed which can also
be related to the fact that most companies tend to see their customers as a trigger of
innovation and a provider of ideas. In turn, this emphasizes the importance of collaborating
with customers.
Company E has strong research collaborations with universities and even competitors since it
is so costly that they can’t afford it otherwise. University or institute collaboration is
38

<-----Page 46----->something that Company C sees as a good way of finding new ideas through, while Company
D collaborates with Universities in the creative phase via workshops. As Company E,
Company C and Company D are active in highly technological industries; the collaboration
they conduct with universities is thought to be a result of the technological development
needed in order to succeed.
6.1.7 The revised fundamental innovation framework
In this chapter, the fundamental innovation framework by Adams et al. (2006) has been
revised after analyzing the comparison between theory and the case company interviews. Both
structural changes on measurement area level have been made, as well as add-ons and
changes of aspects within the different measurement areas. The main observations, on a
structural level are:






The measurement areas suggested by Adams et al. (2006) are to a large extent in
agreement with the actions, procedures and ambitions of the companies interviewed.
The explicit term innovation strategy is not commonly used and well-known among
the companies interviewed although the companies tend to have strategy that
resembles a product strategy. With this follows that the measurement area innovation
strategy are taken away in the revised framework.
The measurement areas communication and information flows are strongly connected
and will be seen as one measurement area (under information flows) in the revised
framework.
The two measurement areas named tools, within both the inputs management and
project management categories, are largely seen as the same by the interviewed
companies. They are merged and will be treated under the inputs management
category.

Further, the revisions made in relation to each category and measurement area are presented
in Table 9 below.

<-----Page 48----->6.2 Evaluation of the innovation strategy framework
Below, the innovation strategy framework by Jaruzelski et al. (2012) is evaluated in
accordance to the case company interviews. The theory (i.e. the resulting add-ons to the
fundamental structure depending on classification as Need seeker, Market reader or
Technology driver as presented in Chapter 4.3 The strategy dependent innovation framework)
are compared with the insights and factors at each case company that usually leads to and
trigger innovations.
6.2.1 Need seeker strategy
A short recap of the characteristics of a company classified as Need seeker, as defined by
Jaruzelski et al. (2012), are stated below:






a Need seeker rely on customer observation and less on traditional market research
when developing new products,
a Need seeker rely on mechanisms that can provide deep insights into the end-users of
their products that go beyond observation of customers directly,
a need seeker depend more on customer focus groups, collaborations with other
external parties and makes use of internal networks to a large extent,
a Need seeker applies cross-unit staffing within projects, conducts formal idea
conferences and events, as well as idea brainstorm sessions (internally and with
customers) to a larger extent than the other strategies do, and
a Need seeker tend to search widely for new ideas and work with a large amount of the
same.

According to the results of the case company interviews, all case companies mentioned
insights from the customers as a main trigger for an innovation, i.e. the customers seem to be
the key source when identifying new opportunities. However, in terms of the unspoken or
subconscious needs of customers – that are significant for a Need seeker – only Company B
mentions that they structurally follow, study and analyze their customer’s behaviors with the
aim to find trends and ides to updated, or new products. Although, some of the empirical
results from the interview with Company E also show similar trends, as they are describing
that they see themselves as successful regarding settling into the driver’s situation (which may
help imagining how a new e.g. solution would work). The authors of this report did not
interpret that any of the other respondent companies’ answers indicated a strong or critical
focus on the customers’ unspoken needs.
Internal or external brainstorm sessions are also something that characterizes a Need seeker
behavior. Brainstorming is used by all companies in the beginning of the ideation process
except for Company E who have more structured ways of finding ideas, according to their
respondent. A Need seeker also tend to search widely for new ideas and work with a large
amount of the same as well as organizing formal idea generating events. This is a behavior
that the authors of this report find at Company C who works a lot with a large amount of ideas
as well as Company B with their formal idea generation processes comprising the “i-labs”, “ijams” or NPD-days (new product development days). Company B also involves the customers
to large extent in these processes and sessions which is a further a characteristic of a Need
seeker. Regarding external collaborations, Company E is the company having the most
extensive and structured external collaborations, referring to the collaborations with
universities and research institutes.
41

<-----Page 49----->Further, some case companies emphasize the importance of cross-functionality, a further
important characteristic of a Need seeker. Company E, Company B and Company A apply
cross-functional decision-making though Company B distinguishes itself from the rest of the
case companies by explicitly mentioning cross-functional teams as an important factor for
success in innovation, which acts as stimuli for the innovation process.
6.2.2 Market reader strategy
A short recap of the characteristics of a company classified as Market reader, as defined by
Jaruzelski et al. (2012), are stated below:





a Market reader is reactive to the market and the surrounding business environment,
a Market reader rely on traditional market research to understand better what is
already working in current markets and what products that are already introduced by
competitors,
it is important for a Marker reader to have a functioning feedback loop with ideas from
customers, between sales and R&D, and
a Market reader focuses on to carry out particularly incremental improvements
efficiently and in order to secure short time to market.

All case companies carry our traditional market research, and it is a factor, by its nature
critical for all companies to succeed. Understanding customer needs, as mentioned as an
important trigger for innovation by all companies, is of course also a part of a traditional
market analysis – but within this classification there is a further reactive focus on the
customer’s stated needs. This is for example seen at Company A, whose respondent explains
that their products and orders are generally developed directly from the customer’s expressed
needs, which according to the authors of this report show that the customer’s spoken opinions
are highly valued.
For a Market reader, large emphasis is also put on analyzing the surrounding business
environment, the competitors and conducting macro analysis. Company B, but particularly
Company E and Company A do follow law regulations in order to innovate. Company E for
example put 60% of their R&D budget to follow sound and emission regulations, which
speaks for the importance of having the right structures and processes within this field.
Though reacting to competitor product launches is mentioned, emphasis is not put here.
Company E’s strength in the innovation process, according to their respondent, is its TRM
(Technology Road Map), which is developed to find future market needs in order to react
upon them. This is further one of Company E’s more structured ways of finding ideas (as
opposed to brainstorming). Further, Company C also scan the surrounding business
environment for technological ideas or patents of interest.
Another characteristic of a Marker reader is the importance of having a functioning feed-back
loop within the company that quickly transports ideas from customers with the aim to finally
become improved products. This is particularly mentioned as important by Company A,
whose respondent explains about ideas that must flow efficiently from its sales organization
towards R&D in order to be considered in product development.
Further, all responding companies may relate to the terms incremental and radical innovation,
although the explicit terms are not always used. According to the authors of this report, the
focus on either incremental or radical innovations are strongly affected by the respectively
industry the case companies are operating within. For a Market reader, incremental
improvements are the focus. This behavior is mostly seen at Company E, whose product
development is very long-term focused and the continuous new product launches therefore
42

<-----Page 50----->most often are of incremental nature. Company A further states that its customers do not often
require the latest advances in technology (that also may lie within Company A’ expertise)
which is a fact according to the authors of this report that drives incremental technological
innovation to a larger extent. Company B’s products generally include less advanced
technology than the other companies’ which may be argued decreases its chances for radical
innovations, but does not exclude them.
6.2.3 Technology driver strategy
A short recap of the characteristics of a company classified as Technology driver, as defined
by Jaruzelski et al. (2012), are stated below:




a Technology driver develops products based on the latest advances in technology,
a Technology driver is self-reliant and internally focused, and
a Technology driver is often depending on internal networks and mechanisms to
develop ideas, and relies less on external networks than the other innovation strategies
do.

Company C, Company E and Company D express technological development as critical to
their businesses. This fact is, according to the authors of this report, highly related to the
advanced technology that is associated with the each company’s products.
Another characteristic of a Technology driver is the self-reliant and internal focus often
related to these kinds of companies. The results from the case company interviews show that
Company B, Company C and Company D are the companies that in some manner have
expressed their internal work and processes as strengths and critical aspects of the respective
companies’ innovation processes. Company D explains its focus on implementing processes
that support all employees to become intrapreneurs. Further, both Company D and Company
C value the slack time that employees may spend on developing own internal projects. The
matter of patents is also mentioned by Company D where processes are set up to have
employees share ideas and make the process of patent applications easier and fairer.
6.2.4 Innovation strategy classifications
To conclude, all case companies interviewed possess characteristics that are related to all the
three innovation strategies presented by Jaruzelski et al. (2012). Clearly, being a company
developing products, a company cannot solidly rely on the input and structures related to only
one of the three in order to become a successful innovator. Although, the authors of this report
have recognized and identified clear patterns that makes all case companies able to be
classified into one of the strategies to a larger extent.
According to the authors of this report, the characteristics and behaviors of Company B are
well in line with the ones that are related to a Need seeker. Company B also shows
characteristics related to Market readers, due to its well-developed processes for market
analysis, competitor analysis etc., but not enough to overcome the Need seeker characteristics.
Company E and Company A do mainly show characteristics that are in line with a Market
reader strategy. Although, Company E has behaviors related to Need seekers as well due to
the extensive external network with universities, and with Technology drivers due to the
nature of the high-tech industry it is operating within. Although, the strong focus on
incremental improvement and its great efforts in monitoring the environment and law
regulations shows the relevance for being classified as Market reader. Further, Company A is
classified as a typical Market reader due to its focus on incremental development as a result of
reacting towards its customers spoken needs. The company does have advanced technology
43

<-----Page 51----->in-house, but is not critical due to that it is not required by its customers – a fact that excludes
Company A for being a Technology driver. Further, both Company D and Company C are
classified as Technology drivers due to the nature of the high-tech industries they are
operating within and due to their strong focus on internal structures and processes that
supports innovation developed in-house.
The discussion above makes the authors of this report conclude that the framework by
Jaruzelski et al. (2012) is valid and that it is possible to classify companies into one of the
three innovation strategies. All company classification and respectively motivations are
presented in Table 10, below.

<-----Page 53----->6.3 Comparing ÅF KAMs’ demands to audit deficiencies
The ÅF KAMs are typical users of the audit tool and were asked for inputs and specific
requirements regarding the design and usage of the same. This was done in order to secure the
usability of the tool and its fit into the sales organization. The comments obtained in the
interviews are below compared to the deficiencies found in the previously reviewed
innovation audits.
One of the KAMs first reactions in the interviews was regarding the innovation terminology
used by the authors of this report. For example, the words “incremental” and “radical” were
generally not understood. Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company A, addressed the issue that if
customers do not understand the terminology in the tool, it could result in less truthful
answers or that the customers become fed up. This is also a limitation found in the audits
reviewed where no explanations of terminology exists. The matter is aligned with an aspect
previously emphasized by the authors of this report, where the audits reviewed do not
consider that the person auditing may not have experience in the field of innovation. This was
also clear during the KAM interviews and Jacob Rydholm, KAM for Company C, stated that
a workshop with all the KAMs could be a good way of learning how the tool works and may
be used. Another aspect considered by the KAMs is having explanatory texts in the tool,
which brings up the need of a manual to guide the KAM through the process. This is perhaps
the greatest defect found in the studied audits and it is well aligned with all the KAMs
emphasis that is put on having a simple and understandable audit tool. Given the KAMs
general concerns that include simplicity and user-friendliness, the authors of this report
strongly believe that background information as well as instructions and explanations of the
tool must be included in order to make the KAMs comfortable and confident in using it.
In terms of analysis, the authors of this report found no support or description of how it
should be carried out in the audits reviewed. The KAMs all agree that the analysis should be
easy, require little time to carry out and preferably be performed electronically. Though a
weakness in the analysis step of the studied audits was found it is clear that the KAMs take
this even further as they are not keen on conducting the analysis by themselves.
Though the structures of the sales processes used by the KAMs are much alike, the way in
which a sell is conducted varies. There is consensus among the KAMs that the tool should be
designed to work as a survey as well as a template for discussion and conversation. This will
make it more adaptable to the way each KAM want to approach a customer. As sales are done
on the terms of the customer, the authors of this report find that adaption to the customer’s
needs of high importance. Adapting a tool to the person being audited is seen to be an aspect
needed to be consider in a sales tool rather than in general innovation audits. This is seen as
the reason for the authors of this report not seeing to this matter when reviewing previously
designed audits, even though neither of the audits reviewed are much adapted to the person
being audited.
The purpose of the audit tool is also to be used in the sales process and according to Pia
Lagerlöf, KAM for Assa Abloy and Henric Flöjs, KAM for Atlas Copco, this affects the way
in which the tool should be structured. A two-step approach is preferred since it may probably
make the customers reflect more and gives more selling opportunities. Just as the requirement
of adapting the tool to the customer, considering a two-step approach is seen as a product of
the tool being aimed at selling rather than only auditing. Neither of the audits reviewed is
divided in two steps and it is not seen as a limitation.
Previously reviewed audits are (with the exception of Aiman-Smith et al. (2005)) seen to lack
the aspect of describing who an appropriate respondent for the audit would be, as well as how
46

<-----Page 54----->many respondents that are most likely to be audited. This matter was elaborated on by the
KAMs where a variety of possibilities emerged. Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company A, means
that such a tool is most useful when executed on development managers, but conducting it on
lower levels might also be an idea. Further, Jacob Rydholm, KAM for Company C states that
a survey could be distributed to several managers at least within R&D and the market division
but also to the process owners. Henric Flöjs, KAM for Company A, elaborates that the
number of people who may be interviewed depends solidly on the company. As the KAMs
are familiar with the skill and knowledge level of the employees of their customers, these
comments are highly valued by the authors of this report. Stating in the tool who it is aimed
for will increase the possibility of getting correct answers.
Another aspect emphasized by the KAMs is that the usage of the audit tool should result in a
win-win situation for the customer and ÅF which is an aspect not lifted as a deficiency in
previous audits as they again, do not have a sales focus.
6.3.1 Tool requirements
After analyzing and discussing the interviews with the KAMs at ÅF, it was understood that
the main limitations found in previously designed audits also reflect the issues that the KAMs
consider. Although, the KAMs also consider areas and issues that are mainly related to the
usage of the tool in a sales process rather than just auditing. Such areas are by the authors of
this report also deemed important to take into account in order to make the tool as usable as
possible. The following factors are identified as requirements of the tool in order to secure its
usability:








The usage of the tool shall result in a win-win situation (ÅF vs. customer)
The tool should be simple and understandable, meaning that:
o Clear descriptions of the terminology and the process should be described
o The analysis steps should be easy to conduct, but preferably be done
electronically
The tool should be time efficient both for the KAMs and for the customers
The tool should mainly be possible to conduct on managers. Possible and appropriate
roles to conduct the tool on should be described
It should be possible to use the tool as a template for interviewing or conversation as
well as a survey
A several-step approach is to prefer.

<-----Page 55----->7 TOOL DESIGN
In this chapter – aimed to answer RQ2 – the creation of the tool, which is based on the
strategy dependent innovation framework, is described and the tool prototype is presented.

7.1 Tool conceptualization
In Chapter 4 Analytical framework an innovation framework was created with an added
innovation strategy dimension that complements the fundamental structure by Adams et al.
(2006), and it was further revised in Chapter 6 Discussion. This new framework forms the
basis for the tool and is aimed at providing the new tool with the best prerequisites to become
more useful than existing audits – since it includes the contingency factor innovation strategy.
Before constructing the tool it was conceptualized as described below.
The design of the new framework provides an organization with the opportunity to be
evaluated by an adapted audit depending on if the organization is classified as Need seeker,
Market reader or Technology driver. With this follows that it is found appropriate that the tool
should be divided into two steps; (1) a step where an organization is classified into one of the
strategies depending on the characteristics of its innovation strategy, and (2) a step that,
according to what strategy a company adopts, actually evaluates how well the organization
performs (within areas that have big impact on the innovation success of a firm adopting the
specific strategy).
Further, since the aim of the tool is to identify unrealized innovation potential within a
product development company, it is also advantageous to use a two-step approach to – via a
gap-analysis – identify where unrealized innovation potential exists. This is also in line with
the intention that the tool should be adapted for usage within a sales organization of a
technical consultancy firm, since the gap may provide the sales organization with
opportunities to take advantage of (e.g. possibilities to sell services that help organizations to
catalyze the identified unrealized innovation potential). The intention of the gap-analysis is
that it should identify areas where the company have a high ambition and willingness to
improve (which is evaluated in the first step), and at the same time have a low score in
performance (which is evaluated in step two), which means that the selling opportunity is
high.

7.2 The choice of an audit tool
From an early point in the study it was decided that the tool would build upon innovation
audits, a method that are recommended by previous researchers when evaluating innovation
(Chiesa et al. 1996; Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004; OECD 2005). The arguments for this
approach also derive from the sales organization at ÅF and the way a sales meeting is
conducted. The KAM or a sales representative carries out their work by engaging in
conversations with representatives of a customer company. This procedure builds upon asking
questions and the KAMs ability to build a lasting relationship and trust. Answered questions
are analyzed and weighted in order to come to conclusions on where support may be needed.
The same structure can be seen in an audit; it is built upon questioning a subject after a pre-set
template, followed by an analysis, conclusion and the potential of finding an area in the
organization where efforts can be put in order to improve. The importance of the KAMcustomer relationship should arguably not be set aside which in turn has made the authors of
48

<-----Page 56----->this report to develop and audit based tool although there are other ways in which tools can be
designed.

7.3 The tool design process
The design process of the tool followed the best practice procedure used when making audit
tools including surveys, in accordance with previous innovation auditing literature (Chiesa et
al. 1996; Cormican and O’Sullivan 2004; OECD 2005). To begin with, the purpose and the
scope of the tool were defined, which is developing an audit tool that identifies unrealized
innovation potential in a product company’s innovation process, and where two important
factors to consider are usefulness and usability. The target group of companies was given by
the scope of this research and the respondents were set to be mangers, as these represents the
main contacts for ÅF.
Later, the created strategy dependent innovation framework was transformed into an audit
tool by turning all factors found to affect innovation into so called five point Likert-items,
which are statements that may be answered by a respondent who rates to what degree he/she
agree to the statement. The usage of this type of questions, or statements, are in accordance to
recommendations by OECD (2005) when auditing innovation, and also turned out to be easy
to use according to the KAMs at ÅF. The usability requirements from the interview with the
KAMs were also considered during the development.
Further steps, such as testing on the case companies, piloting and to get the audit reviewed by
several parties (both practitioners and academia) are also recommended by e.g. the OECD
(2005), but falls outside the scope of this research.
To summarize the tool design process; this tool is meant to build upon of a two-step approach
where the first step includes: classifying the organization into one of the Need seeker, Marker
reader or Technology driver strategies and identifying the desired state of the organization
within areas that are empirically proven to have large impact on innovation success. The
second step includes evaluating the performance within the same areas to identify the current
state. The two steps are to be carried out in separate surveys referred to as Survey 1 and
Survey 2, see description below.

7.4 A tool in two steps
The two survey-based steps that the innovation audit tool consists of are described in the
following sections.
7.4.1 Survey 1 – Classification and identification of desired state
The innovation strategy classification is done in Survey 1 as shown in Figure 2 below. This is
carried out by having the respondent to rank three statements related to their strategy, as well
as answering nine Likert-items on a 5-level scale. The statements to be ranked are linked to
the question how business critical they are to the company. The possible choices are: (1)
understanding your customer’s sub-conscious needs, (2) technology development, or (3)
macro analysis. This question is asked since it was realized during the case company
interviews that it correlates very well with the innovation strategy the company is classified
to. The nine Likert-items used to classify a company into one of the innovation strategies is
based on information from Jaruzelski et al.’s (2012) theory. There is also an option zero in the
scale that can be used if the respondent cannot or will not answer the question.
49

<-----Page 57----->Figure 2. A section of the Classification part of Survey 1

The second part of Survey 1 is based on the innovation organizing framework by Adams et al.
(2006). The questions in this section are also 5-level Likert item questions, where the scale
implies the ambition the organization has to improve in each area. Though many
organizations are eager to improve on many areas, this question is aimed at investigating the
areas prioritized by the company audited. As there seldom are resources enough to ensure
improvement in every aspect of a company, it is interesting to see what areas are chosen and
what areas are not chosen since this may further reflect the strategy of the company. The
option “no opinion” can also be chosen here. See Figure 3 below for a sample.

50

<-----Page 58----->Figure 3. A section of the Identification of desired state-part of Survey 1

The entire Survey 1 is presented in Appendix B.
7.4.2 Survey 2 – Identification of current state
Survey 2 is based on the updated strategy dependent innovation framework, which was
created in Chapter 4 Analytical framework. The areas of evaluation in this step are dependent
on the result in Survey 1 and, as previously stated, Survey 2 is concerned with a company’s
current performance. The questions in this section are also 5-level Likert items (with the
option “no opinion”, where the scale implies the level of performance of the firm within each
statement. A selection of Survey 2 is presented in Figure 4 below where there are implications
in parenthesis for items that are specific for Need seekers (NS), Market readers (MR), and
Technology drivers (TD)

51

<-----Page 59----->Figure 4. A selection of Survey 2

The structure of Survey 2, though including all possible items is presented in Appendix C.

7.5 The auditing procedure
Both surveys are designed to be filled in by one or several respondents (if there are several
respondents – the respondents fill in own copies of the two surveys), but the sales person
responsible for using the tool, may choose to interview the respondent and fill in the results of
the survey him/herself. Below, the analysis of each tool is described in brief. A description
about how to use and analyze the results of the tool is also presented in the tool manual in
Appendix D. This manual is designed for the sales organization at ÅF.
7.5.1 Analyzing Survey 1
When the survey has been completed by the respondent an analysis of the result will be
carried out. The answers to each of the classifying questions are compared to a key where a
weighting between the questions are considered. It was understood during the interviews that
when asked the question “what insight usually triggers the innovation process” all companies
reflexively answered; “customer insights”. Though, after being asked what area out of
subconscious customer needs, technological development or monitoring the surroundings is
most critical to their business, all companies but Company B answered either monitoring the
surroundings or technological development. These companies were further into the interview
classified as Market readers or Technology drives which correlated perfectly with their
answer to this question. This is the reason for this question to be in Survey 1, and also why
the weighting of the question is set to be high. Since all companies are eager to present their
customer focus, it is a risk that a company may answer that their customer’s subconscious
52

<-----Page 60----->needs are more business critical than it actually is. This is why the question was changed into
letting the company rank the three alternatives as well as weighting up the other two possible
answers; technological development and monitoring the surroundings.
The nine Likert questions that follow are directly related to the general actions and behaviors
of Need seeker, Market reader and Technology driver companies. The results of the questions
that a company scores high respectively low on, are summarized and finally concludes to
which strategy the company belongs. Table 11 gives an overview of the statements and which
strategy that is likely to rate the statement higher than others.
Table 11. Explanations of the purpose of the classification statements

Market readers

We have high focus on developing completely new
products or doing major changes to already existing
products

Technology drivers

Similarly, the second part of Survey 1 is analyzed to identify the desired state within areas
that influence innovation. The premise that the tool should be carried out in a resource
effective manner implies that no excess questions should be asked. By later generating Survey
2 based on the areas where the customer is most urgent to improve (as found out in Survey 1),
the potential for a large gap in the gap analysis increases, and questions in the second survey
can be focused on these areas. Given that a company is a Need Seeker and is eager to improve
on the measurement areas “people”, “information flows” and “collaboration”, Survey 2 will
be generated to ask questions in these three areas and complement with added or modified
questions that are relevant for a Need Seeker.

53

<-----Page 61----->Depending on the customer being audited the number of measurement areas investigated in
Survey 2 may vary. A busy customer may only have time two answer three areas while
another customer may have time to answer to five or more. This is up to the KAM to decide.
7.5.2 Analyzing Survey 2
The gap analysis is carried out by comparing the answers of Survey 1 with Survey 2. For
example, if the customer expressed eagerness to improve in the “people” measurement area
and rate a low skill level on the statement “All employees are committed to the innovation
process” (that belongs to the same measurement area), there is a big gap. Hence, the sales
person may make discussions around this gap and potentially understand the customer needs
better. It may also be interesting to audit different persons in the organization to see if there
are discrepancies in their answers. A discrepancy may also lead to interesting discussions with
the customer related to why the opinions differ.

<-----Page 62----->8 DISCUSSION
In this section, discussion and final remarks from the authors of this report are presented.
The aim of this research was to investigate the aspects of usefulness and usability within the
field of innovation auditing. This was done by creating an innovation audit tool that identifies
unrealized innovation potential in a product company’s innovation process, and that consider
both the factor of usefulness – to make the tool situation customized – and the factor of
usability – as seen from a practitioner’s perspective. Two research questions were formulated
in the beginning to fulfill the aim, and that have been answered in previous chapters. Below,
the authors of this report present some discussion points and final remarks made over the
results and the findings during the research.

8.1 Auditing innovation potential
Innovation and innovation management are complex concepts with several definitions and
interpretations that have been stated in previous literature and by the interviewed case
companies. Although, both researchers and practitioners tend to agree on its significance in
order to secure a sustained completive advantage for organizations, and in order to make sure
that an organization is on the right track within the field – an innovation audit may, and can,
be conducted.
The authors of this report chose to use the term innovation potential as the main subject for
the developed tool. A potential implies the possibility of improvement within a specific area,
and to detect unrealized innovation potential gives a direction of where (within which area of
innovation) an organization may excel if action is taken. Further, unrealized innovation
potential may be detected in several ways; but it is related to detecting gaps, or voids that are
possible to fill. These gaps – when it comes to innovation – are in existing audits detected by
comparing the current state of an organization with a best practice case, where the best
practice cases are most often collected from other companies that are generally seen as
successful innovators. Although, the authors of this report argue that innovation is such a
context specific concept which makes it difficult to compare one organization’s results with
others organizations’, even if they are operating within the same industry. Further, gaps may
also be detected when comparing the same organization over time, to follow the internal
development within the area, which is seen as highly appropriate by the authors of this report.
Further, as the tool that was developed in this research was meant to be used in a sales
organization, and due to that one constraint was that it should not be designed to be used over
a long time – another type of gap aimed at identifying unrealized innovation potential was
found appropriate. This gap, where innovation potential is hopefully detected, is between an
organization’s current state and the state where the organization actually have the ambition to
be. Within such a gap – where an organization itself has stated an ambition to improve and
where there is improvements needed – the possibility to sell innovation services is high.

8.2 The strategy dependent innovation framework
The first research question was answered by a merge of the holistic framework by Adams et
al. (2006) and the innovation strategy framework by Jaruzelski et al. (2012). The result of the
updated strategy dependent innovation framework were a design as follows; (1) a
fundamental framework or the “must haves” consisting of the universal structure that all
55

<-----Page 63----->companies need in order to give their innovation process and practices the best prerequisites
to succeed, and (2) a strategy dependent part, depending on if a company is classified as Need
seeker, Market reader or a Technology driver. The strategy dependent innovation framework
was developed to meet the aim regarding the usefulness of the later developed tool, and to
make the tool situation customized to organizations that adopt different innovation strategies.
In order to create an as useful tool as possible, existing innovation audits were reviewed by
the authors of this report, and the main deficiencies regarding usefulness were identified as;
(1) the frameworks used in the innovation audits are aimed for a wide scope of organizations
which makes them to general to generate an accurate result, and (2) the audits concentrate on
a wide scope of areas to be audited within the same survey, which results in a delivered
analysis that is shallow. Therefore, in order to increase the usability of the new innovation
framework, innovation strategy was identified as an appropriate contingency factor. This is
due to that different innovation strategies, that organizations may adopt, need different
support within the early innovation process (due to their distinct way of managing the
innovation process and its relationships to customers and the market), and therefore need to be
audited in different ways. This reasoning is supported by previous research within the field as
well as by the empirical study of this research. For example, Tang (1999) states that an
organization’s direction, goal and success in innovation can be clearly traced to organization’s
innovations strategy and the empirical results show that there are clear differences in the case
study companies’ actions that could be traced back to their strategy of choice.
By using this updated strategy dependent innovation framework as a basis for an audit tool –
the audit will be able to generate a more accurate and useful analyses for the audited
organization. The authors of this report therefore argue that the usefulness of this tool has
increased, in comparison to other innovation audits, since this framework makes it possible to
adapt the audit to firm specific needs which will lead to a more useful and accurate result. The
authors of this report has also presented a more holistic innovation framework than previous
audits (as validated in Appendix A), which makes this developed tool more comprehensive
than previous audits.

8.3 The tool
In Chapter 7 The tool, the innovation audit tool is presented (see also Appendix B and
Appendix C). Some further discussion and important remarks of the results are presented
below.
8.3.1 Areas of usage
This research had two main delimitations that had impact on the developed tool – which is
that it should be made for product innovation, and focus on the innovation process (as
opposed to the whole product development process). Though all literature used has been
directly or indirectly related to technological or product development it may be of importance
to sort out whether the designed tool only is applicable to product innovation or not. As stated
in Chapter 1 Introduction, innovation can be carried out within the service, process, marketing
method or organizational method areas (OECD, 2005). As the literature reviewed does not
explicitly exclude these areas there is a possibility that the tool may also be applicable to one
or many of these innovation types. Seeing to the measurement areas included in Survey 2,
most are related to general innovation management and cannot solidly be seen related to the
innovation of products. Adapting management to innovation and creativity is related to
managing people, and not products. This implies that product innovation management and
56

<-----Page 64----->service innovation management can arguably be done in the same way. The only
measurement areas solely relatable to the innovation of products are those related to R&D and
technology as these questions imply the development of a physical product. The authors of
this report emphasize that though the majority of measurement areas presented could seem to
also affect other forms of innovation, the areas have been brought forward during studies of
product development. Therefore the tool is first and foremost adapted to this.
It may also be discussed that the firms interviewed for this study varied in size, which all have
influenced the design of the tool. The size variation means that the tool may be conducted on
different types of organizations, including different sub-divisions. The tool is therefore not
just to be used on whole organizations.
8.3.2 Tool limitations
There are of course limitations with the developed tool that may be important to discuss. As
many other innovation audits, the tool does not evaluate the actual performance of an
organization within innovation, it evaluates and identifies where there is room for
development and improvement. To actually evaluate the innovation ability of an organization,
deeper investigations must be made involving all levels of employees within a firm,
preferably over time. Further, this tool aimed at evaluating if the relevant structures and
processes are in place, and therefore do not measure the output of innovation. Another
limitation follows the fact that the tool is to be conducted on managers (one or several) which
means that the results relies on their subjective perceptions of how the firm is performing
within the area. To get a more accurate picture, several managers within different functions
must be audited, but also people from the remaining workforce as they are a large part of the
important company culture – which is an example of an area that ought to be evaluated by the
staff.
Further, there has not been room within the scope of this research for testing the tool, which
means this is a developed prototype that will need more validation before it’s results can be
seen as fully reliable.

8.4 Usefulness versus usability
This research has explored the possibility of making an innovation audit both useful and
usable. As stated in Chapter 1 Introduction, usefulness refers to practical worth or
applicability, in terms of relevant result to the company audited while usability is closely
related to user-friendliness and the convenience and practicality of use. In this thesis, the two
have been inversely correlated meaning that high usability tends to result in low usefulness,
and vice versa. This can be traced back to the KAM interviews, where a more usable tool was
considered to have easier and fewer questions, as well as fewer steps that include analysis.
This fact combined with the notion that a more useful tool is more adapted, thus more
complex, implies that usefulness result in complexity, and usability results in simplicity. The
two conflicting aspects have thus forced the authors of this report to prioritize between them
during the development of the tool.
To fulfill the aims of usefulness, the conclusion was drawn by the researchers of this report
that the tool needs to be adapted towards different types of companies. This fact has
implications on the usability, since it automatically leads to a more complicated tool to use.
The final result was a tool of two dimensions, including generic parts relevant for all
companies, and a company specific part depending on the Need seeker, Market reader or
Technology driver classifications. Adding the strategy dimension was essential according to
57

<-----Page 65----->the authors of this report in order to achieve the usefulness requirement. This was also
considered as an appropriate contingency factor to adapt after, since it is generic and all
companies may relate to either one of the classifications. Dividing the possibilities of strategy
dimension into only three ways allows for adaptability that is not too complex, which is seen
as a strength.
Given the complexity that the strategy dependence brings the author has mainly focused on
adding clear explanations and instructions to raise the usability aspect of the toolThe relationship between usefulness and usability has caused the purpose of the thesis not to
depend upon two separate research questions but two combined research questions inversely
dependent upon each other. Balancing the two has been a main challenge to consider and to
account for the authors of this report’s reasoning within this aspect – the primarily limiting
factor of the two has been considered to be the usability factor, due to the fact that the tool
suffers chance of not being used at all by the KAMs if not deemed usable”.
Given the circumstances, the tool as seen to be very usable thanks to the regular contact the
KAMs at ÅF, the users of the tool. It is therefore the authors of this report’s conclusion that
the tool is lacking in usability, is made up for in usefulness.

8.5 Final words
This research has explored the area of usefulness and usability in innovation auditing and has
presented a result of an audit prototype with properties that no other innovation audit has.
This research has taken the aspects of usability and usefulness in innovation auditing a step
further by giving them extra focus in the development. An increased focus on usefulness
makes the usage of this developed audit more adapted and applicable to companies using it
(which leads to a more accurate analysis), and the focus on increased usability makes it more
easy to use by practitioners. This audit has also been developed with the aim to be possible to
use in a sales process, a focus not yet taken by previous researchers. Further, this research also
contributes to the field of innovation strategy by exploring how an organization’s actions
related to innovation strategy affects the innovation process.

<-----Page 66----->9 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this chapter, recommendations as well as suggestions for future work is presented.

9.1 Recommendations
The studied firm, ÅF, has been provided with a prototype of an innovation audit tool which is
intended to be used in the sales process of the firm. Firstly, we recommend the ÅF staff that is
involved in the sales organization (both managers and the sales people) to conduct a training
session with the aim to (1) learn about and get an understanding about innovation’s role in a
product company and the factors that affect product innovation, and (2) learn how the tool is
intended to work (purpose, procedure etc.) and adapt the tool procedure to individual
requirements that fits the sales representatives in the best way.
The authors of this report believe that it is important for the sales representatives to acquire a
sufficient knowledge base before starting to use it in order to feel comfortable in a situation
with a client. The audit tool provides a suggestion of how it can be used, but its scope may be
narrowed down or extended, and the way of using it (e.g. by interviews or letting the
respondent fill in a survey) may vary, depending on the requests of the sales person and the
circumstances with the client. It is important to stress that the exact procedure is up the sales
person to decide. It is further recommended for the sales organization at ÅF to start testing the
tool on a few companies to investigate its accuracy and the best way of using it. Lastly, the
sales organization at ÅF also needs to consider what to actually do with the outcome – are
there e.g. any specific services to offer the client that are related to the areas in need of
identified improvement?
In a wider perspective, the authors of this report believe that using this tool is a way for the
sales people at ÅF to learn about their clients by creating a basis for discussion. It is also a
way for ÅF as a company to show the clients that ÅF is interested in being a part of future
product development of the companies, and that ÅF is in the forefront of developing services
that are intended to create a sustained competitive advantage within product development for
the same.
Further, the results also have implications for other parties or managers aiming to evaluate the
innovation potential of an external party or organization. The tool may be used as a sales tool,
but also just for evaluation of a firm’s innovation structure, depending on the characteristics
that classifies a company into a Need seeker, Market reader or Technology driver.

9.2 Future work
This research has presented an innovation audit prototype, created by a combination of
knowledge received from previous literature as well as an empirical investigation of
companies with product development of hardware products as principal activity. The main
aspect that must be considered in future research is the issue of testing the audit tool, with
regards to its usefulness and its usability. Regarding the usefulness aspect, the contingency
factor – innovation strategy – needs to be tested in terms of how relevant the classification are
as well as how accurate the analysis of the classifications is when the tool has been conducted
on an organization. Regarding the usability aspect, the user-friendliness of the tool may be
tested – both from the auditor’s point of view as well as the respondent’s. Examples of
important aspects to consider within the usability area are; if terminology is understood, if the
59

<-----Page 67----->KAMs may execute the audit tool with confidence, if the usage of the tool is resource
efficient, and if the company representative understands the benefit of the tool.
Further, when the tool has been tested and redesigned iteratively and the level of usefulness
and usability has been confirmed to be at a desired level, the tool could be developed further.
The fact that the tool is currently aimed for managers to be the respondents might be a
limiting factor since it does not include the employee’s on non-managerial level’s perceptions,
which is of importance when assessing factors such as company culture. The tool may be
revised to also fit this target group to become more holistic. In accordance to the requirements
of the KAMs at ÅF, the tool may also be transformed into a computer software program. This
would further increase the usability of the tool.
Looking at the design process of the tool, it could be used to make similar audit tools that may
be created for circumstances that may have other demands on the usability or the usefulness.
Should another contingency factor be of relevance, it may either be substituted or added to the
framework using the techniques described in this report. In the same sense, a tool adapted for
process or service innovation may be created by simply exchanging the technological aspects
of the tool to other measurement areas.

It can be noted that measurement areas such as internal information flows, risk/return balance and
optimization tool use are vaguely mentioned as important by other researchers. Though this fact may
argue for the irrelevance of the areas, the same later turned out to be mentioned as important aspects
during the empirical interviews.

<-----Page 71----->APPENDIX B: Innovation survey no. 1
In Appendix B, the first survey of the strategy dependent innovation audit is presented.

Innovation survey No. 1
This survey is the first out of two surveys that together aim to identify unrealized potential in areas that affect product
innovativeness. The first survey focuses on innovation strategy as well as the organization’s ambition to improve within 13
specific measurement areas. The survey is confidential between the surveyed organization and the ÅF sales department.

Terminology
Innovation – An idea realized to either create a new or improve an existing product.
Innovation process – The process of exploiting an idea from realized opportunity to finished prototype
Social networking – People socializing and conversing with (to them) new people
Innovation strategy – Statement or document by which an organization plans to stay continuously innovative

Appendix D presents the manual of the tool.

Innovation Tool Manual
Background
It is widely accepted that innovation is strongly connected to the growth and competitiveness of an organization,
it is the basic prerequisite for an organization to survive. Innovation may be seen as a competitive advantage
since new products or services help organizations to capture and retain market shares.
In order to provide support when it comes to understanding the ÅF customers better and get to know the
challenges they are facing within product innovation – this audit tool was created. The tool is aimed to be used in
the sales process and provides the sales person with a possibility to identify areas – that are empirically proven to
affect the innovation ability of a firm – where potential of improvements exists. The tool is adapted for
customers with product development as principal activity.

General information
The tool is limited to the innovation process which can be divided into the four steps: (1) opportunity
identification, (2) idea generation and selection, (3) prototyping and (4) testing. These are the phases that mainly
affect product innovation in terms of product experience, usage and design.
The tool has been developed to be answered by managers, preferably several managers that represent different
divisions of the company that is going to be audited. Managers mainly suitable to interview/audit are R&D
managers, product managers, market managers and innovation managers (if that title exists). The important
aspect is that the managers interviewed have a clear relation to the four steps of the innovation process.
Other interesting ways of using the tool may be to compare answers between the different divisions of the
organization, e.g. the market vs. the product department, or maybe having the sales team answer the tool and
comparing the answers to the ones of the company.
The tool may be used in different ways depending on the requirements of the sales representative as well as
circumstances related to the audited firm. The tool is designed to be used either as a survey that the interview
object may answer by him/herself, as an interview conducted by the KAMs or sales-representative, or as a
conversation guide.

Terminology
Innovation – An idea realized to either create a new or improve an existing product.
Innovation process – The process of exploiting an opportunity by following the above stated steps
Incremental innovation – Innovative improvements of an already existing product
Radical innovation – Related to disruptive or breakthrough innovation; a product innovation that greatly
changes the behaviors of the customers and/or the industry
Social networking – People socializing and conversing with (to them) new people
Innovation strategy – Statement or document through which an organization plans to stay continuously
innovative

The theory behind the tool
Adams et al. (2006) realized the need for a holistic framework for innovation management. Summarizing vast
amounts of research resulted in a framework that may be used by managers to evaluate their innovation activities
and management. This framework is the basis of this tool with some adjustments to adapt it better to the
customers interviewed. The framework consists of six categories: inputs management, knowledge management,
innovation strategy, organizational culture and structure, portfolio management and project management
including different measurement areas.
Tough the framework is widely seen as accurate it gives a quite general picture of what managing innovation

innovation strategy. This due to that adopting (and following) an innovation strategy has been proved important
to succeed with innovation and different innovation strategies need different structures to be in place in order to
be supported the best.
There are three innovation strategies, or rather “approaches” that build upon what factors that actually trigger
innovations (and give birth to ideas) within a firm. The three strategies are called Need seeker, Market reader
and Technology driver strategies. It is important to note that neither of these strategies outperforms each other,
the success factor lies within following either of them. It must further be mentioned that all companies include
characteristics from all the three strategies, although the most of the companies are possible to categorize to a
further extent within one of them. Explanations of the three strategies are described below.
Need seekers rely on creating innovations based mainly on their customers’ unspoken needs. A Need seeker may
be detected by their great efforts in observation, collaboration and communication with their customers. Need
seekers tries to go beyond what the customer’s stated needs and to interpret their customers’ behavior.
Market readers are more reactive in the way they innovate. The word “market” is not to be confused with the
Swedish word “marknad” as this usually also involves customers. “Market” is an implication of the surrounding
industry and business environment, including trends, competitors and to large extent law regulations. Market
readers often start their innovation process due to changes in the surroundings. Market readers are often fast in
making incremental innovations.
Technology drivers are companies that rely on technological discoveries in order to innovate, thus their main
focus is R&D. They are more internally focused than other companies and ideas most often derive from within
the company.

Tool structure
The design of the new strategy dependent innovation framework provides an organization with the opportunity
to be evaluated by an adapted audit depending on if the organization is classified as Need seeker, Market reader
or Technology driver. With this follows that the tool is divided into two steps; (1) a step where an organization is
classified into one of the strategies depending on the characteristics of its innovation strategy and identifying the
desired state of the organization within areas that are empirically proven to have large impact on innovation
success, and (2) a step that, according to what strategy a company adopts, actually evaluates how well the
organization performs, the current state (within areas that have big impact on the innovation success of a firm
adopting the specific strategy).
Further, the unrealized innovation potential is identified via the two-step approach and a gap- analysis. This is
also in line with the intention that the tool should be adapted for usage within a sales organization of a technical
consultancy firm, since the gap may provide the sales organization with opportunities to take advantage of (e.g.
possibilities to sell services that help organizations to catalyze the identified unrealized innovation potential).
The intention of the gap-analysis is that it should identify areas where the company have a high ambition and
willingness to improve (which is evaluated in the first step), and at the same time have a low score in
performance (which is evaluated in step two), which means that the selling opportunity is high.

Tool procedure
The tool consists of four steps where two are surveys that are to be answered by the customer. The aim of the
surveys are to find areas in which the customer has an ambition to improve and comparing these to their current
performance.

Survey 1 to be filled in. Consists of two steps (a and b) carried out by the customer:
a. Aimed to categorize the customer into one of the three innovation strategies by nine questions.
This step is named Innovation strategy.
b. Examines the desired state of each of the measurement areas that affect product innovation.
This step is named Evaluation of desired state.
Analyzing Survey 1. Consists of two steps carried out by the sales representative:
a. Comparing the customers Innovation Strategy answers with a key (see below) in order to
classify the customer to one of the three innovation strategies.

Note which 3-5 (or any number) measurement areas in which the customer’s ambition to
improve is the highest. Word-documents named after these areas are printed along with a front
page. This is a customized Survey 2.
Survey 2 to be filled in. Carried out by the customer:
This survey is based on questions to decide the current performance in each area on a more
detailed level. Either have your customer to fill in the survey or make it into an interview. This
step is named Evaluation of current state.
Gap-analysis:
Comparing the customer’s answers in Evaluation of desired state with Evaluation of current
state reveals gaps where performance is low and desire to improve is big. Such knowledge –
and such gap – may then be used as a basis for new conversations and realized customer needs.

Classification of customers – “the key”
In order to classify the customers into one of the three innovation strategies the typical answers of a Need seeker,
Market reader and Technology driver are shown in the examples below. The first question regarding what areas
is the most business critical has been seen as very representative for what innovation strategy a company has.
This is why it should be considered to a large extent, although it is important to keep in mind that companies in
general like to express their customer focus even though they may not be a Need seeker. It is also important to
keep in mind that a company may have a higher market or technology focus due to their industry, though it is not
the strategy of the company by choice.
= typical answers of a Need seeker.
= typical answers of a Market reader.
= typical answers of Technology driver.
