While a variety of techniques have been used to infer compensatory versus n o n c o m p e n s a t o r y decision making, few studies have used multiple
measures in order to evaluate their validity. Using a sample of 48 college
students, this study examines two measures from a search task (the variability
and pattern of search on an information board) and three measures from a
rating or judgment task (nonlinear regression modeling, ANOVA measures of
interaction and curvilinearity). The validity of these measures is assessed by
their sensitivity to a manipulation of information load and their extent of convergence with one another. The variability of search on the information board
and the ANOVA measures of interaction and curvilinearity all indicated an
increase in noncompensatory decision making under high information load,
while the regression modeling measure did not. There was some convergence
between the regression and ANOVA indices, but no relation between the
search task and rating task measures. It is concluded that the ANOVA measures of interaction and curvilinearity are more sensitive measures than the
nonlinear regression procedure. The information board and ANOVA measures
are apparently both valid indices of noncompensatory decision making; they
may lack convergence because they represent different parts of the decision
process (information acquisition vs combination) or require different responses (choice vs judgment).

Research on decision making has used a variety of techniques for making inferences about the decision process. One of the oldest and most
widely used techniques is that of policy capturing, wherein the model
guiding the decision process is inferred from the relationships between the
cues provided and the judgment of the subject. While linear regression is
most commonly used, the relationships between cues and judgments can
be assessed through a variety of techniques, such as ANOVA (e.g.,
Slovic, 1969; Anderson & Shanteau, 1977) or nonlinear regression (e.g.,
Goldberg, 1971). A newer technique is the information board (e.g., Payne,
1976). Here, inferences about a subject's decision processes are based on
the search pattern evidenced by the subject. For example, a linear, compensatory model is inferred if the subject searches for information within

alternatives and looks at a constant amount of information for each alternative.
While there have been several calls for the examination of multiple
indices of the decision process (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981; Payne,
Braunstein, & Carroll, 1978; Svenson, 1979) few multimethod decision
making studies have been reported. One such example is a study by
Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, and Kleinmuntz (1979). Using two judges and two
different tasks, the authors built a regression model of each judge and also
formulated process-tracing models based on verbal protocols elicited
while the subjects made the judgments. Both types of models showed
similar predictive ability and were concluded to be valid representations
at their own level of detail. While these results are encouraging, more
research is needed, using more techniques and larger samples of subjects,
to insure that conclusions can be generalized across different measures.
The research reported here pursues this same general question: Do
different measures or representations of the decision process produce the
same results? The measures examined include the following: the variability of search and search pattern obtained from the information board
procedure (e.g., Payne, 1976); the relative fit of linear and nonlinear regression models obtained through the usual judgment procedure (e.g.,
Einhorn, 1970); the extent of interactive use of cues, obtained by an
ANOVA on a fractional replication design (e.g., Slovic, 1969; Slovic,
Fleissner, & Bauman, 1972); and a measure of the curvilinear use of cues
which has not been previously applied to decision making research. Except for the measure of curvilinearity, each of these measures has been
used in numerous studies to infer the use of a compensatory versus noncompensatory decision strategy. The validity of such inferences is examined in this study by collecting all measures on the same sample of subjects and evaluating their sensitivity to a manipulation of information load
and their convergence with one another.
Before presenting the results of this experiment, a number of issues
must be discussed. The differences between compensatory and noncompensatory decision models will be explored, followed by a discussion of
the five measures employed in this study. The procedures to be used to
evaluate the measures are explained next. Finally, comes a discussion of
the variations in the task that are needed to obtain the measures to be
studied.
DECISION MODELS AND OPERATIONAL MEASURES
Models
While a number of decision models have been described in the literature, a basic distinction is between compensatory and noncompensatory

<-----Page 2----->PROCESS T R A C I N G VERSUS P O L I C Y C A P T U R I N G

333

models. N o n c o m p e n s a t o r y m ode l s such as the c o n j u n c t i v e or
elimination-by-aspects (EBA; Tversky, 1972) models would be indicated
by the interactive use of cues. The search pattern of someone following a
noncompensatory strategy would show a variable amount of information
examined and/or used for each alternative. This variable pattern occurs
because a low score on one dimension cannot be compensated for by a
high score on another dimension, causing that alternative to be eliminated.
Compensatory strategies generally refer to the linear model, although
the additive difference model is compensatory when the difference functions are linear (Tversky, 1969, p. 43). Along with an absence of interactive use of cues, compensatory strategies imply the search for and use of a
constant number of cues for each alternative.

Measures and Their Relation to Models
Information board. The different techniques examined in this research
have been used to indicate the use of compensatory versus noncompensatory decision strategies. The information board (e.g., Bettman & Kakkar, 1977; Payne, 1976) generally contains information about alternatives
on cards which must be taken out of envelopes or turned around to be
viewed. A typical format would have alternatives in rows and dimensions
or attributes in columns. The subject is instructed to examine those cards
that are felt to be necessary to select one alternative. Different search
patterns are used as indicators of decision strategies: compensatory
strategies would be indicated by interdimensional search using a constant
amount of information per alternative (linear model) or by an intradimensional, c o n s t a n t p a t t e r n (additive difference). N o n c o m p e n s a t o r y
strategies would be indicated by using a variable amount of information
per alternative and searching interdimensionally (conjunctive) or intradimensionally (EBA).
Regression modeling. Various regression models have been used to
infer the use of non-compensatory decision processes. Einhorn (1970;
1971), has suggested a specific model that approximates the conjunctive
strategy. Defining the judgment for each alternative as Y and the attributes as X1, X2. . . . Xn, judgments based on a conjunctive strategy should
be predicted well by

If a conjunctive strategy is being used, Einhorn argues that this function
should fit the data better than the linear regression model.

ANOVA---interaction. ANOVA offers an alternative to regression,
with the primary advantage being the direct indexing of interactive use of
cues. When cues are orthogonal, either through a fully crossed design
(e.g., Anderson, 1962; Hoffman, Slovic, & Rorer, 1968) or a fractional
replication design (e.g., Anderson, 1964; Slovic, 1969), the amount of
interaction can be indexed by the variance accounted for by the interaction terms.
ANOVA--curvilinearity. The final measure of the decision process requires some explanation. Curvilinearity in the use of cues has often not
been clearly distinguished from interaction. Curvilinearity occurs when
the values of a single cue do not show a linear relation to the judgments.
This nonlinear relationship may take a number of forms, such as various
types of step functions. The most extreme curvilinearity occurs when a
moderate amount of the cue is most preferred, creating a nonmonotonic
function. Interaction and curvilinearity may occur separately or together.
The distinctions are often blurred, however, as both are commonly referred to as nonlinearity.
While noncompensatory models imply interactive use of cues and compensatory models imply lack of interaction, the implications of these
models for curvilinearity are less clear. The linear model implies no curvilinearity, but the additive difference model allows for curvilinear preference functions. Tversky (1969) presents this model as one that can account
for intransitivity of preference if some difference functions are nonlinear,
implying that curvilinearity may exist, although it is not necessitated.
With regard to noncompensatory models, the conjunctive model implies curvilinearity because cutoffs are an inherent part of the model.
While Tversky (1972) does not discuss curvilinearity, the EBA model
seems to imply curvilinearity, as alternatives are eliminated if below a
cutoff and, presumably, all scores above the cutoff are treated as equal in
desirability. In summary, while there is some ambiguity, compensatory
models tend to imply lack of curvilinearity and the presence of curvilinearity would be an indication of noncompensatory models.
EVALUATING MEASURES OF THE DECISION PROCESS

Effects of Information Load
One way to evaluate measures of compensatory versus noncompensatory decision processes is to manipulate a variable which should affect the
decision process and observe the effect on each measure. One variable
which is widely assumed to affect the decision process is the information
load placed on the subject. The usual line of reasoning is that noncompensatory strategies are easier to use than compensatory strategies, and
therefore are more likely to be used by a subject as the amount of information to process increases or the time available decreases.

<-----Page 4----->PROCESS T R A C I N G VERSUS P O L I C Y C A P T U R I N G

335

Several studies have investigated the effects of information load on
decision p r o c e s s e s . Using an i n f o r m a t i o n board, P a y n e (1976)
operationalized information load as both the number of alternatives and
dimensions. He found that an increase in number of alternatives led to
greater use of noncompensatory strategies, but that number of dimensions
had no such effect. Wright (1974) varied the time available to make judgments on multidimensional objects (cars). Judgments were modeled using
a linear model and a "negative bias" model, with the latter being quite
similar to Einhorn's conjunctive model. As time pressure increased, the
negative bias model fit better than the compensatory model. Einhorn
(1971) varied the number of dimensions per alternative and assessed the
fit of the linear, conjunctive, and disjunctive models in two judgment
tasks. Contrary to predictions, subjects did not appear to use a noncompensatory strategy to a greater extent under higher information load.
However, there was some evidence from postquestionnaires that subjects
used complex, multistage models more often under greater information
load. Finally, Olshavsky (1979) used verbal protocols to measure decision
processes and varied the number of alternatives and number of dimensions. As the number of alternatives increased, there was a change from a
single stage strategy to a two-stage strategy with elimination of some
alternatives through a noncompensatory strategy, followed by a compensatory process to evaluate the remaining alternatives. Number of dimensions affected how dimensions were weighted, but did not produce noncompensatory behavior.
In summary, the hypothesis that increased information load produces
noncompensatory decision making has been supported with several
operationalizations of information load and with different techniques for
measuring decision process. Further, it appears as if the effect occurs
more reliably when information load is operationalized as time pressure or
number of alternatives, as compared to number of dimensions. Accordingly, these manipulations will be used and an observed effect on a decision measure will be taken as evidence of the construct validity of that
measure.
Convergence among Measures
Another major technique for evaluating the construct validity of various
measures involves assessing the extent of convergence among different
measures of the same construct. As discussed above, more extensive use
of a noncompensatory decision process is indicated by (1) greater variability in the information searched per alternative, (2) more variance accounted for by the log model (Eq. (1)) than the linear model, (3) a larger
amoung of variance accounted for by interaction terms, and (4) a larger
amount of curvilinearity.

PROBLEMS DUE TO VARIATIONS IN THE TASK

As they are typically used, the measures to be evaluated in this research
imply slightly different tasks and operationalizations. The major difference among the information board, regression modeling, and ANOVA
procedures involve the format for presenting stimuli, the relationship
among cue values, the phase of the decision process examined, the type of
response elicited from the subjects, and the operationalization of information load.
The typical method of presenting stimuli with the information board is
to put pieces of information on cards, place the cards in an alternatives by
attribute matrix, and have the subjects view the information sequentially
as they turn over the desired cards. Model fitting, either through ANOVA
or regression, generally involves the presentation of all information on an
alternative (or on all alternatives) on a single sheet of paper. While these
procedures differ in several ways, one important underlying difference is
in whether information is presented sequentially or in summary format.
This variable has been shown to affect the use of information in other
domains. For example, summary presentation leads to more accurate
judgment of the degree of covariation of two variables (Crocker, 1981).
Similarly, a summary list of unit prices has been shown to increase the use
of this information (Russo, 1977)'. One study (Bettman & Kakkar, 1977)
using information boards has examined presentation format by comparing
a matrix format with an alternative format (separate booklets for each
alternative containing cards) and an attribute format (booklets containing
all the cards for a given attribute). This manipulation of format affected
the search pattern (inter vs intradimensional), and the number of alternatives, attributes, and total cards examined; variability of search was not
reported. Apparently, then, information format affects some decision behavior, and, although it has not been directly studied, the type of format
difference existing here might affect behavior indicative of compensatory
versus noncompensatory strategies.
The degree of correlation among the cue values has not been a salient
issue with information boards. The typical application would use all possible combinations of cues, although some studies (e.g., Payne, 1976)
have deleted alternatives with certain combinations of cues (e.g., when all
dimensions are very positive). Although not systematically studied with
the information board, this issue of correlation among cues has been an
ongoing concern in research which fits models to judgment data (e.g.,
Anderson & Shanteau, 1977; Dudycha & Naylor, 1966). Studies which
use regression generally have correlated cues, while ANOVA requires
orthogonal cues. Furthermore, Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, and Kleinmuntz

<-----Page 6----->PROCESS T R A C I N G VERSUS P O L I C Y C A P T U R I N G

337

(1979) argue that discrimination between the conjunction and linear model
is facilitated by negative correlation among cues.
Although all of these procedures are presented in the literature as attempts to measure the decision process used, the information board and
modeling procedures differ with regard to what part of the entire decision
process is the focus. The information board examines acquisition or information search, while the other techniques concern the evaluation
phase, as they attempt to model how information is combined to form a
judgment. The models presented in the literature (e.g., conjunctive, EBA)
imply effects on both phases of the decision process, although, as Einhorn
and Hogarth (1981) point out, the psychological processes underlying the
different phases of the decision process may vary and be affected by
different external factors.
The response obtained from the subject also differs in the usual applications of these techniques. The information board asks the subject to
choose one alternative, while the modeling paradigms ask for an explicit
evaluation of each alternative. While evaluation may often occur before
choice, it does not always do so. As pointed out by Einhorn, Kleinmuntz,
and Kleinmuntz (1979), choice and evaluation are likely to result from the
same process only under certain conditions (e.g., when time is sufficient,
when the task is important). While the distinction between choice and
judgment should be pursued empirically, it is important to note that the
procedures studied here vary in this regard and may produce different
results simply because they require different responses.
Finally, the operationalization of information load has generally varied
for these techniques. As noted above, the most common and successful
manipulation of information load has been number of alternatives for the
information board and time pressure for policy capturing.
These differing procedures present something of a dilemma. If the usual
procedures were followed to gather each measure, then different tasks
and manipulations would be demanded. On the other hand, in order for all
measures to be calculated from the same data, the procedures would have
to be dramatically altered. In this study the decision was made to use the
procedures typically employed in the literature, so the results would be
applicable to the existing research which uses these techniques. Accordingly, subjects performed two tasks, a search task using an information
board and requiring the choice of one alternative, and a rating task which
required an evaluation of each alternative. The content and the values of
the cues were the same in both tasks, however. In order to compute the
ANOVA index of interaction, a fractional replication design (Slovic, 1969)
was used. This meant that cues were uncorrelated, which may have reduced the ability of the regression models to accurately discriminate between compensatory and noncompensatory use of the data.

METHODS

Subjects
The subjects were 48 undergraduates who participated as part of a
course requirement in an introduction to psychology class.

Procedure
Each subject was run individually in a 1-hr session. There were two
separate tasks, a search task using an information board and a rating task.
The order of these tasks was counterbalanced across subjects.
Search task. Subjects were told they would be presented with a number
of alternatives, each representing a different one-bedroom furnished
apartment. Information concerning four aspects of each apartment
(cleanliness, distance, rent, and size) was available on the backs of the
index cards found in the envelopes on the wall in front of them. They were
to choose the apartment they preferred for themselves based on the information provided and as many or as few cards as they liked could be
turned over. Subjects were told that they should work at their own pace,
as there was sufficient time for the task.
Information load was manipulated by varying the number of alternatives a subject was presented with. Each subject faced four decision situations. These consisted of 2, 5, 8, and 12 alternatives and four dimensions
of information per alternative. The order of presenting the decision situations was counterbalanced across subjects. The 27 alternatives were the
same as those used in the rating task (see below) and the order of presentation of the alternatives was randomized for each subject.
A practice set of alternatives (three apartments) was given prior to the
first trial to familiarize the subjects with the procedures. There was a
short rest break after choosing an apartment before a new set of apartments was presented. During the rest break the subjects sat with their
backs facing the wall with the envelopes, to prevent them from seeing the
experimenter put the next set of alternatives in place. Also during this
period, the subjects responded to a question about the amount of information which was available in the situation they just faced. This procedure was repeated until all four decision situations were completed.
Rating task. In this portion of the experiment, subjects evaluated two
sets of 27 apartments. They were told to rate each apartment individually
on a 7-point desirability scale. Once a rating was completed, they were
unable to go back and change it. To keep the subjects from seeing their
previous rating another sheet of paper with a section cut out was placed
over the rating form. This top sheet was moved down the rating form as
each apartment was evaluated so it covered the previous ratings while
allowing the subjects to rate the next apartment.

339

There were two conditions of information load for each subject in this
part of the experiment. In the low information load condition, the subjects
were given as much time as necessary to complete the ratings. Under high
information load the subjects had only 2 min and 30 sec to complete all the
ratings. They were told that they would have to work quickly, as this
allowed them approximately 5 sec per apartment. After every 30 sec the
subjects were told how many apartments they should have rated by then
and to speed up if behind schedule. If the subject had not rated all 27
apartments in the allotted time, he/she was told to speed up and was given
approximately 5.5 sec per apartment for the remaining ones. Immediately
following each information load condition, the subjects responded to
questions concerning perceived information load, felt time pressure, and
how rushed they felt while rating the apartments.
The same set of 27 apartments was used under both information load
conditions, but the order of the alternatives differed. The two rating forms
were counterbalanced across the two conditions of information load and
the order of presenting the two conditions of information load was counterbalanced across subjects.
Stimuli

The stimuli in both tasks consisted of descriptions of one-bedroom,
furnished apartments. Four dimensions and three levels per dimension
were used: monthly rent ($110, $140, $170), size (small, moderate, large),
cleanliness (poor, fair, good), and walking distance to campus (10, 20, 30
min). Three levels were necessary to allow examination of curvilinearity,
as explained below.
In order to obtain an unambiguous measure of interactive use of data, it
would be desirable to have all possible combinations represented. However, this would produce a prohibitively large number of alternatives (81).
Accordingly, a fractional replication design was used (Slovic, 1969). A 1/3
fractional design reduced the number of stimuli to 27 and still allowed for
the estimation of main effects and first-order interactions (Connor &
Zelen, 1959, p. 11). In this particular design, main effects are confounded
with higher order interactions, but not with first-order interactions, and
some first-order interactions are confounded with other first-order and
higher order interactions. If it is assumed that higher order interactions
are negligible (Goldberg, 1968; Slovic, 1969), then the proportion of total
variance can be calculated separately for total main effects and for total
first-order interactions.
Measures o f Decision Process
Search task. Two measures were abstracted from the information board
task--variability of search and search pattern. Variability of search was

<-----Page 9----->340

B I L L I N G S A N D MARCUS

operationalized as the percent of information searched per alternative and
then computing the standard deviation of these percentages for the 2, 5, 8,
o r 12 alternatives on each board. This measure was treated both as a
continuous score and dichotomized into constant (standard deviation of
zero, meaning that the same amount of information was searched for all
alternatives) or variable (standard deviation greater than zero). The
search p a t t e r n - - i n t e r d i m e n s i o n a l versus intradimensional--was calculated in the same m a n n e r as Payne (1976). Each move to a new piece o f
information which was within the same alternative and across dimensions
was classified as an interdimensional move, while a move within a dimension and across alternatives was labeled as intradimensional. Moves to
both a different alternative and a different dimension were labeled shifts.
The search pattern variable was defined as the n u m b e r o f interdimensional moves minus the n u m b e r of intradimensional moves divided by the
sum of these two numbers. This index was calculated separately for each
board and was treated as a continuous measure and also dichotomized
into interdimensional (positive values) and intradimensional (negative
values).
The search pattern and the variability of search were also combined to
yield an indication of the decision model apparently used by each subject
on each board. The two c o m p e n s a t o r y models would be indicated by an
interdimensional, constant pattern (linear model) or an intradimensional,
constant pattern (additive difference). Two n o n c o m p e n s a t o r y models
would be indicated by interdimensional, variable (conjunctive) and intradimensional, variable (EBA).
Rating task---regression indices. As argued by Einhorn (1970, 1971) the
use of a conjunctive strategy would be indicated when the log transformation model (see Eq. (1)) predicts judgments better than the linear regression model. Accordingly, both models were applied to each subject's
judgments on the rating task, under both high and low information load,
and the amount of variance accounted for (R ~) was determined. When the
R 2 for the linear model e x c e e d e d that from the log model, the subject was
classified as compensatory, while the opposite pattern was labeled noncompensatory. A continuous measure of the extent of n o n c o m p e n s a t o r y
use of the information was also desired. While the R 2 for the log model
could be used in this way, it is necessary to control for the amount o f
variance accounted for by the linear model. It was dxpected that these
two measures would be highly correlated, because subjects who were
more consistent in their use of information would be fit well by both
models. (In fact, the two R 2 measures correlated .88 under low information load and .93 under high information load.)
Rating task---ANOVA index of interaction. The fractional replication
design allows for the estimation of total variance due to all first-order

<-----Page 10----->PROCESS T R A C I N G VERSUS P O L I C Y C A P T U R I N G

341

interactions. This estimate is confounded with higher order interactions,
but not with main effects. Accordingly, eta squared (72) values were
computed for the six first-order interactions and summed to create an
index (labeled ~ / ] ) of amount of interactive use of the data. This estimate
of variance due to interaction can be divided by the total variance accounted for ( ~ ]
+ ~],
where M stands for main effects), to yield a
second index of extent of interactive use of the data.
T h e amount of variance due to interaction correlated negatively with
the amount of linear variance accounted for ( - . 8 6 under low information
load and - . 8 4 under high). Therefore, as was the case with the log transform index, the R 2 from the linear model will be partialled out of the
interaction measure in the subsequent analyses. While this procedure
provides a continuous measure of the extent of interactive use of the data,
it does not automatically allow classification of subjects as interactive
versus noninteractive. As this fractional replication design does not aUow
for a significance test o f the interactions, a median split on the ~ ~/] index
was used. The median score on the ~
index, disregarding conditions,
w a s . 1045.
Rating task---index of curvilinearity. The curvilinear use of data was
indexed by calculating eta squared (72) between each cue and the subject's judgment. As this measure includes both linear and nonlinear variance accounted for, it is necessary to subtract the linear variance (r ~) from
~72 to obtain an index of the degree of curvilinear use of data. This difference, often referred to as deviation from linearity, can be tested for significance (Blalock, 1972, pp. 408-413).
To obtain a continuous measure o f extent of curvilinearity, the difference score was summed across the four dimensions for both conditions of
information load. This measure is negatively correlated with the linear R z
( - . 4 4 and - . 6 1 , under low and high information level). Accordingly, the
linear R 2 will be partialled out of this measure, following the same logic as
for R 2 for the log model and the interaction measure.
In order to categorize subjects as curvilinear or not, the deviation from
linearity was tested for significance. As this test is somewhat underpowered, a liberal alpha level o f . 10 was used. A subject was classified as
curvilinear if one or more dimensions showed significant deviation from
linearity.

RESULTS

Order Effects
Several multiple A N O V A S were computed on the dependent variables
to examine effects due to order of tasks (search vs rating), order of conditions (low vs high time pressure in the ratings task and number of alterna-

<-----Page 11----->342

tives in the search task), order of rating form, and their interactions. The
only significant effect was the interaction of task order by rating form
under high time pressure, with R z for the log model being the only dependent variable affected. This effect was not easily interpreted. Given that
the number of effects was far fewer than would be expected by chance, it
was concluded that order effects are not significant, and these variables
were disregarded in all subsequent analyses.
Manipulation Checks

The results for the manipulation check in the search task are presented
in Table 1. A repeated measure ANOVA showed a significant effect due
to a number of alternatives (F(3,141) = 16.76, p < .001). Post hoc tests
using Dunn's procedure indicated significant (p < .01) differences between 2 alternatives and all others, and between 5 and 12 alternatives.
Thus, as the number of alternatives increased beyond two apartments the
perceived information load increased, but as the number increased from 5
to 8 to 12, the increase in perceived information load was more gradual.
The results for the manipulation checks for the rating task are presented
in Table 2. Because the three measures are highly intercorrelated, a
MANOVA was conducted, with the F distribution derived from Rao's
transformation of Wilks' lambda (Tatsuoka, 1971). The result showed that
the time pressure manipulation strongly affected felt time pressure, feeling of being rushed, and perceived information load, with the multivariate
F(3,45) = 200.77 (p < .001).
Classification o f Conditions on Low versus High
Information Load in Search Task

Collapsing the four conditions into low versus high information load
would simplify the analyses and facilitate the examination of convergence
among the measures. The manipulation check (Table 1) shows a clear

Effects of Information Load on Decision Indices
Search task. The results for the decision indices from the search task
are shown in Table 3. When subjects are classified into one of the four
decision models, a clear difference between compensatory (linear and
additive difference) and noncompensatory models (conjunctive and EBA)
occurs as a function of information load. Eight subjects were compensatory under both conditions, nine were noncompensatory under both, and
no subjects were noncompensatory under low and compensatory under
high information load. The remainder (31) were compensatory under low
and noncompensatory under high. The appropriate statistical test is the
McNemar test (Marascuilo & McSweeney, 1977), which tests the symmetry among scores that change. The asymmetry here is highly significant
(31/31; p < .001) and in the predicted direction, with subjects exhibiting
n o n c o m p e n s a t o r y strategies under high information load. Separate
examination of the two continuous decision indices in Table 3 confirms
this conclusion. Variability of search, which is the indicator of compensatory versus noncompensatory processes, is affected by information
load, but search pattern (inter/intradimensional) is not.
It is noteworthy that this shift in decision processes occurred in a
within-subjects design with the information load manipulation counterbalanced for order. The large majority of subjects shifted their strategies
back and forth between compensatory and noncompensatory either once
(when the two-alternative trial was at the start or finish) or twice (when
the two-alternative trial was second or third).
Rating task. Tables 4 and 5 contain the results for the regression
analysis of the rating task. Using Einhorn's log transformation model
resulted in approximately half of the subjects being classified as conjunctive in each condition (23/48 under low, 28/48 under high). This measure
indicates that only 19 subjects shifted strategies, with 12 being in the
predicted direction. The McNemar test shows that this proportion is not
significantly different from chance (p = . 180).
The results for the continuous measures of R 2 for the linear and conjunctive model are presented in Table 5. If this measure were to indicate
an increase in the use of conjunctive model under high information load,
the conjunctive R 2 would be greater than the linear R 2 in that condition.
This did not occur. The linear and conjunctive R2's were very similar
under both conditions, and the difference between the two R 2 values was
not affected by information load. Further, the fit of both the linear and
conjunctive model was better under low as compared to high information
load. The conclusion is that an increase in information load did not cause
an increase in conjunctive behavior--as indexed by Einhorn's measure.
The results for the ANOVA measures of curvilinearity and interaction
are also given in Tables 4 and 5. The measure of curvilinearity does not

show an effect of information load when subjects are categorized into
linear versus curvilinear (Table 4), as only 9 out of 14 (p = .212) subjects
shifted in the predicted direction. However, the continuous measure of
curvilinearity (Table 5) is apparently more sensitive. This measure--the
difference between 72 and r 2 summed over the four cues--showed a significant increase in curvilinear use of information as information load
increased.
The ANOVA measure of interaction shows the strongest effect. Almost
two-thirds of the subjects are categorized as linear under low information
load, while nearly as many are classified as interactive in the high condition (Table 4). This shift in the use of information (14/17, in the predicted
direction) is highly significant (p < .001). Both continuous measures of
interactive use of cues (Table 5) are strongly affected by information load.
The amount of variance accounted for by the first-order interactions increased from around 10 to nearly 16%, and the percentage of total variance explained went from 11 to 17.5%. This pattern occurred because the
increase in interactive use of cues was matched by a corresponding decrease in noninteractive use of cues; the ~)2 for the main effects decreased
from .835 to .752 as information load increased. (Note that this measure
includes both noncurvilinear and curvilinear variance.) Furthermore, the
total amount of variance explained (total 72 for interaction and main effects) was not affected by information load. This measure of linear, curvilinear, and interactive use of cues was .937 under low information load
and .907 under high information load.

Convergence among Measures
Table 6 presents the correlations among the decision indices for both
low and high information load. As discussed earlier, the rating task measures are highly correlated with the amount of linear variance. Accordingly, the linear variance has been partialled out of all correlations.

Four of the measures are meant to indicate compensatory versus noncompensatory decision processes: variability in the search task, R z for the
conjunctive model, curvilinearity, and interaction. A positive correlation
between any two of these measures, with linear variance controlled,
would indicate convergence in the expected direction. No specific predictions were made with regard to the relations between pattern of search
(intra- vs interdimensional) and the other measures.
Under low information load, the search task measures are neither related to each other nor related to the rating task measures. Under high
information load, variability and pattern of search are negatively correlated, meaning that greater variability is associated with a stronger intradimensional pattern. The two significant correlations between search
and rating measures under high information load are not as expected. The
correlation between search pattern and interaction means that an interdimensional pattern is associated with lower interaction. No necessary
relationship was predicted here and the meaning of this correlation is not
entirely clear. The second negative correlation suggests that more variability is associated with less curvilinearity, while just the opposite pattern was predicted.
Turning to the relations among the rating task measures, there is some
evidence of convergence between the regression and ANOVA measures.
The R 2 for the conjunctive model shows moderate convergence with interaction under low information load and with curvilinearity in the high
condition. The other two correlations (R 2 conjunctive with curvilinearity
under low and with interaction under high) do not differ from zero,
however.
Contrary to expectation, the ANOVA measures of curvilinearity and
interaction are negatively correlated in both conditions. Although the
usual decision models imply either that both occur (e.g., conjunctive) or
that neither occurs (e.g., linear), these results suggest that those subjects
showing more curvilinearity tend to show less interaction.
The inverse relationship between curvilinearity and interaction is
further demonstrated by categorizing subjects, using the decision rules
described above. Under high information load, 25 subjects were classified
as interactive but not curvilinear, and 12 were curvilinear but not interactive. Seven were neither and only four were both interactive and curvilinear. These results, combined with the results on the effects of information load, suggest that some subjects responded to high information
load by using information in a curvilinear fashion, while other subjects
responded by using information interactively. In contrast with the models
that lump these two types of nonlinearity together, a significant number of
subjects (37/48; p < .001) simplified the situation by becoming either
configural or curvilinear, but not both.

In summary, there is no evidence of convergence between the search
and rating task measures of noncompensatory behavior. The nonlinear
regression measure and the ANOVA measures show some convergence,
and the two ANOVA measures show an unexpected negative correlation.

DISCUSSION
This study examined the validity of policy capturing and process tracing
measures of decision making. Using a within-subjects design, four indices
of c o m p e n s a t o r y versus n o n c o m p e n s a t o r y decision behavior were
gathered on a search task, using an information board, and on a rating
task, using regression and ANOVA measures. The effect of information
load on each measure was taken as one indication of the validity of the
measures. Here, all measures except one showed the predicted effect of
greater noncompensatory decision making under high information load;
the variability of search on the information board, and the extent of curvilinear use of data and the amount of variance due to interaction from the
ANOVA on the rating task all showed the effect, while the log transform
regression model did not.
It should be noted that information load affected the variability of
search on the information board, but not the pattern of search (inter- vs
intradimensional). In other words, shifting from an interdimensional pattern (linear or conjunctive) to an intradimensional one (additive difference
or EBA) or vice versa apparently does not help subjects deal with an
increased number of alternatives, while moving from a compensatory to a
noncompensatory strategy does. When a subject is faced with a moderate
to large number of alternatives, the strategy seems to be to eliminate
alternatives quickly. Accordingly, noncompensatory strategies are used
and a variable search pattern is produced as alternatives are eliminated
when a cutoff is not met.
Returning to the issue of validity of these measures, a second indication
of validity is the extent of convergence among the measures. The information board indices did not show the expected convergence with the
rating task measures; only two of the 12 correlations were significant and
these were not in the expected direction. The three rating task measures
showed some convergence. The expected positive correlation occurred
for two out of the four correlations between the log transform regression
measure and the ANOVA indices: with the interaction measure under low
information load and with the curvilinear measure in the high condition.
Surprisingly, the measures of curvilinearity and interaction were negatively correlated in both information load conditions.
These results suggest the following conclusions. Einhorn's (1970) log
transformation model would seem to be the least sensitive measure, as it
was not affected by information load but did show some convergence with

<-----Page 18----->PROCESS T R A C I N G VERSUS P O L I C Y C A P T U R I N G

349

the ANOVA indices. This conclusion of a lack of sensitivity should not be
surprising, because this regression model attempts to fit a continuous
function which only approximates a multiple cutoff model. In contrast,
the ANOVA indices give a much more direct and exact measure of curvilinear and interactive use of cues. Further, even a true conjunctive
function, being conditionally monotone, is well represented by the linear
model, particularly when it contains error in the predictors (Dawes &
Corrigan, 1974). Under these conditions, which may have occurred in this
experiment, the linear model may fit as well as the log transform model.
In addition, the log transform regression model is most sensitive to
actual nonlinear use of cues when the cues are negatively correlated with
each other (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979). As compared to
orthogonal cues, this pattern produces more alternatives that sharply differentiate between linear and nonlinear models (e.g., high value on one
cue and low on the rest). Because orthogonal cues were needed in this
study to conduct the ANOVA, conditions were not ideal for Einhorn's
measure. While this may have "stacked the deck" against this measure, it
does question the usefulness of the technique when cues are orthogonal,
as they are in many experiments, and, by extension, to most real-world
decision tasks, where cues are likely to be either uncorrelated or positively correlated.
The validity of the measures of curvilinearity, interaction, and variability of search was demonstrated in one sense, because they were all affected by the manipulation of information load. However, they did not
converge as expected. This means that those subjects who were noncompensatory on one task were just as likely to be compensatory or noncompensatory on the other task. Given the within-subject design, this also
means that some subjects were affected by information load on the search
task, while other subjects were affected by the manipulation on the rating
task.
As there were several differences between the two tasks, there are
several explanations for these findings. The information board examines
acquisition of information, while the rating task involves the combination
of information to produce a judgment. Perhaps some subjects can cope
with an increase in information load during one phase of the decision
process, but not the other. The lack of convergence within each information load condition further suggests that some subjects use different processes in the acquisition versus combination phase. For example, a subject might look at the same number of cues for each alternative (and
appear to be compensatory), but combine those cues in an interactive
fashion (and appear noncompensatory). Most models of decision making
(e.g., conjunctive, linear, EBA) may be too simplistic in this regard, for
they all assume that acquisition and use of information show the same
patterns.

<-----Page 19----->350

B I L L I N G S A N D MARCU S

This conclusion is consistent with studies that have found an increase in
the use of a two-stage decision process as the number of alternatives
increases (e.g., Olshavsky, 1979; Payne, 1976). These studies have found
evidence of an initial phase in which noncompensatory strategies are used
apparently to reduce the number of alternatives, followed by a phase
using compensatory strategies to evaluate the remaining alternatives and
make a choice. While these two phases are not precisely the same as
acquisition versus combination of information, the general conclusion is
the same: different decision strategies may be used during various phases
of the decision process.
Another explanation for the lack of convergence between the two tasks
in this experiment may have to do with the different responses required
(choice vs judgment). The distinction between choice and judgment is
often blurred; for example, policy capturing studies demand explicit
judgments on each alternative, but are often generalized to all decision
making tasks. Furthermore, judgment does not always precede choice
and the two may involve different psychological processes. (See Einhorn,
Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979, for discussion on this point). While
there are other possible explanations, the lack of convergence between
the two tasks in this study may mean that decision making behavior is
affected by the response required by the task. However, it is important to
point out that the observed pattern was not as one might expect. Einhorn
et al. (1979) imply that, in general, compensatory behavior might be expected with a judgment task and noncompensatory behavior with a choice
task. In contrast, this study found that both types of behaviors occurred in
both tasks, but for different subjects, and information load shifted subjects toward noncompensatory behavior, but different subjects were affected. The effects of choice versus judgment may be complex and should
be the subject of future research.
Moving to the two ANOVA measures of curvilinearity and interaction,
it was surprising to find that they were negatively correlated with one
another, even though both were affected by information load. The pattern
was very clear; as information load increased, some subjects simplified
the task by using information in a curvilinear fashion, other moved toward
interactive use of cues, but very few subjects did both.
While consistent with the general hypothesis that nonlinear decision
behavior increases as information load increases, these findings are not
supportive of the usual models of decision behavior. Such models (e.g.,
conjunctive, EBA) imply that the two types of nonlinear use of information occur together. For example, the conjunctive model includes cutoffs
(hence, curvilinearity) that are used multiplicatively (interaction). The
strong negative correlation between these two elements of the conjunctive
model questions a basic assumption of that model. Classifying subjects as

<-----Page 20----->PROCESS TRACING VERSUS POLICY CAPTURING

351

either conjunctive or nonconjunctive may result in a loss of important
information.
It is worth noting that the subjects in this experiment showed remarkable flexibility and adaptability in their decision behavior. Information
load was manipulated in two different ways in a within-subjects design,
yet there were no meaningful order effects. Subjects moved back and
forth between compensatory and noncompensatory decision styles, as the
information load dictated. This research demonstrated that subjects can
change their decision behavior as the demands change, even after a certain strategy has been adopted.
Finally, an inevitable question is raised with this type of research:
which is the best way to measure noncompensatory decision behavior-process tracing or policy capturing? This research suggests that both can
produce valid measures. However, the relationships among the various
measures appear to be more complicated than was predicted. The relationship found between curvilinear and interactive use of information
questions the assumptions behind some widely used decision models.
Further, the results caution us to attend to the stage of the decision
process we are studying and to the type of response demanded by the
task.
