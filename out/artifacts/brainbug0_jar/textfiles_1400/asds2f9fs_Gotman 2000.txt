Decade Review: Observing Marital Interaction

This article reviews the advances made in the decade of the 1990s in observing marital interaction. Many technological advances in data collection, including synchronization of physiology,
behavior, and cognition, and advances in data
analysis such as sequential analysis, have yielded
new understanding and advances in prediction of
marital outcomes. The advances have also included the study of developmental processes, including
the transition to parenthood and the study of midlife and older marriages. Central advances have
been made in the study of affect and the study of
power and in their integration. This advance has
included the mathematical modeling of interaction
using nonlinear difference equations and the development of typologies. There has been an added
focus on health outcomes and the bidirectional effects of marriages on children. There has been an
expansion of the study of marital interaction to
common comorbid psychopathologies. Most important has been emergent theorizing based on the
interaction of behavior, perception, and physiology, as well as their predictive power.
Observational research plays a major role in research on marriage, both for purposes of description and for building theories of the mechanisms
underlying central phenomena occurring within

families. It is the main roadway available for the
precise study of family process. It has always been
obvious to many scientists that observational research can enhance the study of marriages by adding a depth and richness to other, less expensive
methods, such as surveys and questionnaires. In
the decade of the 1990s, however, it also has become clear that observational methods can add
predictive power and theoretical clarity. These important accomplishments stem, in part, from the
power of observational data to reveal a replicable
portrait of complex social interaction that lies beyond the natural awareness of even the most keenly sensitive spouse or partner, and thus lies beyond
assessment with self-report instruments.
Many of these advances also have been enabled by significant technological breakthroughs
in observational research that occurred in this past
decade. With the arrival of inexpensive computerassisted coding, live real-time observational coding, or the rapid coding of videotapes synchronized to computer-readable video, time codes
became feasible. An observer can now code complex interaction between husbands and wives in
real time and later compute onsets, offsets, and
durations of speaker/listener events, compute interobserver reliability, and also perform sequential
and time-series analyses that require knowledge of
exactly when the events occurred. The merging of
video and computer technology also has made it
possible to time-synchronize the real-time acquisition of physiological and observational data
from an interacting couple, and the use of video
playback methods made it possible to time-synchronize spouses’ perceptions and cognitions of

the interaction. Thus, technology has made it possible to study, with time-synchronized data, the
dynamic interplay between behavior, cognition,
and physiology. Researchers discovered that the
isolated study of behavior, cognition, or physiology without careful study of their interdependencies would severely limit mapping findings onto
the real interactional world of the couples we were
studying. The technical breakthroughs of the
1990’s have narrowed the gap between couples’
natural experience of their relationship and researchers’ precise understanding of study participants.
Advances in understanding marriage stem not
only from breakthroughs in technology, but also
from innovations in the methodologies used to extract information from the ongoing flow of interaction. Floyd (1989) reviewed research on the
choice of coding units of different sizes and complexities. More and more interest was paid to developing global coding systems to capture targeted interactional processes. Basco, Birchler, Kalal,
Talbott, and Slater (1991) developed and validated
a rapid rating scale called the Clinician Rating of
Adult Communication (CRAC). Bèlanger, Sauborin, Laughrea, Dulude, and Wright (1993) compared macroscopic global coding systems (Marital
Interaction Coding System-Global and the Global
Couple Interaction Coding System) and decided
that the convergence was moderate and that it was
premature to conclude that these macroscopic
coding systems are interchangeable. Julien, Markman, and Lindahl (1989) presented a new global
coding system and correlated it to the positive and
negative codes of a more microanalytic Couples
Interaction Scoring System (CISS). Although negative codes between the two systems showed
some convergence, the positive codes did not.
Couples high in marital satisfaction reported higher mutuality, whereas couples lower in marital satisfaction reported higher levels of destructive process, coercion, and postconflict distress. Wampler
and Halverson (1990) developed a Q-sort observational measure of marital interaction, and they
related it to their measures derived from the CISS
(Notarius, Markman, & Gottman, 1983).
A more powerful method of creating global
categories from more microanalytic categories
was a factor analysis reported by Heyman, Eddy,
Weiss, and Vivian (1995) using 995 couples’ videotaped conflict interactions using the Marital Interaction Coding System (MICS). The factors
formed were hostility, constructive problem discussion, humor, and responsibility discussion. It is

Journal of Marriage and the Family

interesting that these super-categories are quite
different from earlier suggestions for a global
MICS system made by Weiss and Tolman (1990).
An alternative approach to global coding was the
work represented by the Gottman and Levenson
laboratories in which detailed microanalytic coding with multiple coding systems was undertaken
(e.g., Gottman, 1994). This included the coding of
facial expressions (the Emotion Facial Action
Coding System, Ekman & Friesen, 1978), MICS
coding, the development of a more rapid version
of the CISS (RCISS, Krokoff, Gottman, & Hass,
1989), and a Specific Affect Coding System
(Gottman, McCoy, Coan, & Collier, 1996) that
codes macrolevels of emotional expression (e.g.,
anger, sadness, fear). This work has led to reliable
microanalytic real-time observational coding of
marital interaction in both conflict and nonconflict
contexts. One advantage of coding specific affects
is greater precision in studying positive affect.
Gottman, Coan, Carrere, and Swanson (1998)
found that positive affect was the only predictor
of both stability and happiness in a sample of
newlyweds. Finally, a more macro look across
time at marital interaction was offered in a review
by Christensen & Pasch (1993). They broke down
marital conflict into seven stages, beginning with
the precipitating event and evolving through the
fight and then a return to normal.
The decade of the 1990s also saw the more
widespread application of sequential analytic
methods for the quantitative study of patterns of
interaction between two people over time, the use
of time-series analyses, and the mathematical
modeling of marital interaction. In two landmark
papers published in 1993, Griffin (1993a, 1993b)
demonstrated an innovative approach for how
event history analysis could be applied to the
study of insider evaluations of marital interaction.
The first paper described the methodology, and
the second paper applied it in a study of marital
interaction. Couples had two conversations, one
about pleasant memories and one about a problem, and then they engaged in a video recall of
affect procedure. The self-rating of affect during
the video recall were the data for the analyses.
The dependent measure was time until there was
a transition out of negative affect. Griffin reported
that, consistent with the Gottman and Levenson
(1986, 1988) hypothesis, wives maintained a negative affect state longer than husbands did, particularly on the problem task.
Griffin and Greene (1994) reported the results
of analyzing one case of orofacial bradykinesia

<-----Page 2----->Marital Interaction

exacerbated during marital conflict. They used an
interrupted time-series analysis to demonstrate
that an increase of the symptoms followed a series
of specific negative comments by the spouse in
the conversation. Gottman et al. (1998) applied
interrupted time-series analyses to their newlywed
heart rate data to assess the extent to which a
number of marital affective behaviors were either
self-soothing or spouse-soothing; in a second step,
they then used these data to predict marital outcomes 6 years later. As predicted by Gottman and
Levenson (1988), only soothing of the male
spouse (primarily self-soothing) predicted positive
marital outcomes.
We will focus the remainder of our review on
what we see as the two primary advances made
in the study of marital interaction in the decade.
First, we will examine how researchers have taken
the fruits of cross-sectional, hypothesis-generating
descriptive research and tested models for predicting the longitudinal course of relationships
over time. These prospective studies were a major
advance occurring in the decade, and their results
demonstrate the maturation of the discipline. Second, we examine the empirical developments in
several core content areas: (a) the study of power,
(b) the exploration of marital interaction as a
proximal determinant of individual well-being and
distress, and (b) the study of interrelationships
among interactional behavior, perception, and
physiology. We will end with a commentary of
the decade of research and a discussion of future
research for the next decade.
THE STUDY

OF

COUPLES OVER TIME

Developmental Transitions
The family life cycle has been used to describe
the natural history of couples over time. It is intuitively appealing to suppose that the interactional patterns characterizing young couples versus
older couples, or young parents versus older parents, for example, are stamped with unique qualities that determine if the couple is adaptively
passing through important and challenging family
life-cycle transitions or not. Colloquially, couples
expect the marriage to be different ‘‘once the honeymoon is over,’’ and empirically, we know that
parents on the average experience a significant decline in satisfaction after the birth of the first child.
Divorce prediction. Basic descriptive research
during the 1980’s paved the way in the 1990s for

interactional research that can track the longitudinal course of marriages and can predict divorce.
For a review of methodological issues, see Bradbury and Karney (1993). Gottman and Krokoff
(1989) reported that a different pattern of interaction was related to concurrent marital satisfaction than to the change in marital satisfaction over
time; for example, disagreement and anger were
related to lower concurrent marital satisfaction,
but to improvement in marital satisfaction over
time. Buehlman, Gottman, and Katz (1992) reported that, in a sample of families with preschool-aged children, their coding of an Oral History Interview was able to predict divorce or
stability over a 3-year period with 94% accuracy
using a discriminant function analysis. The oral
history variables were also correlated in clear
ways with Time 1 marital interaction in both problem solving and affect, the couple’s physiological
reactivity during marital interaction, as well as
Time 1 and Time 2 marital satisfaction. Gottman
and Levenson (1992) reported the first prospective
longitudinal study of divorce prediction that used
observational data. They found that a couple’s interaction and spouse’s physiological responses observed at Time 1 were associated with a set of
variables forming a cascade toward divorce. Couples starting on this cascade toward divorce at
Time 1 had interactions that were marked by more
negativity than positivity, and they rated their interactions more negatively upon video recall.
Wives in these couples also had significantly higher heart rates and smaller finger pulse amplitudes
(which could be part of a general alarm response
in which blood is drawn into the trunk from the
periphery). Subsequent work on the divorce prediction question with another sample of couples
(Gottman, 1993, 1994) identified the ratio of positivity to negativity during the conflict discussion,
and four specific negative interaction patterns
(criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling) as highly predictive of divorce (see also
Gottman et al., 1998; Matthews, Wickrama, &
Conger, 1996).
Transition to marriage. Smith, Vivian, and
O’Leary (1990) studied premarital problem-solving discussions and predicted marital satisfaction
at 18 months and 30 months after marriage. The
negativity of the premarital interaction correlated
with concurrent marital unhappiness but was not
predictive of postmarital satisfaction. Controlling
for premarital relationship satisfaction, affective
disengagement during a premarital problem-solv-

<-----Page 3----->930

ing discussion was negatively associated with
marital satisfaction at 18 months and 30 months
after marriage. Cohan and Bradbury (1997) examined the longitudinal course of marital satisfaction and depressive symptoms in newlywed marriages over an 18-month period. Problem-solving
behavior mediated but did not moderate the relationship between life events and adjustment. In
particular, angry wives had better adjustment to
major and interpersonal events so that their depressive symptoms were reduced and their marital
satisfaction increased.
Gottman et al. (1998) reported the results of a
multimethod longitudinal study predicting the
eventual 6-year marital happiness and stability
from newlywed interactions observed in the first
months after the wedding. Seven types of process
models were explored: (a) anger as a dangerous
emotion, (b) active listening, (c) negative affect
reciprocity, (d) negative startup by the wife, (e)
de-escalation, (f) positive affect models, and (g)
physiological soothing of the male spouse. Support was not found for the models of anger as a
dangerous emotion, active listening, or negative
affect reciprocity in kind, either low or high intensity. Support was found for models of the husband’s rejecting his wife’s influence, negative startup by the wife, a lack of de-escalation of
low-intensity negative wife affect by the husband,
or a lack of de-escalation of high-intensity husband negative affect by the wife, and a lack of
physiological soothing of the male spouse, all predicting divorce. Support was also found for a contingent positive affect model and for balance models (i.e., ratio models) of positive-to-negative
affect predicting satisfaction among stable couples.
Transition to parenthood. In the past decade, four
landmark books were published that summarized
key longitudinal research projects on the transition
to parenthood (Lewis, 1989; Michaels & Goldberg, 1988; Cowan & Cowan, 1992; Belsky &
Kelly, 1994). There have been approximately 15
longitudinal studies on the transition to parenthood; many of the others were not prospective,
longitudinal studies. The longitudinal findings are
remarkably consistent. Most have concluded that
for the overwhelming majority of couples this
transition can be both extremely stressful and
pleasurable. For approximately 40 to 70% of couples, there is a drop in marital quality. In general,
marital conflict increases by a factor of 9, people
are at risk for depression, there is a precipitous

Journal of Marriage and the Family

drop in marital quality within 1 year after the birth
of the first child, people revert to stereotypic gender roles, they are overwhelmed by the amount of
housework and child care there is to do, fathers
withdraw into work, and marital conversation and
sex decrease enormously. There is also an increase
in joy and pleasure with the baby. The longitudinal studies have all discovered the strong linkages between the prebirth marital system (particularly highlighting the couple’s conflict resolution
skills, and a sense of ‘‘we-ness’’), the parent-child
system, and the baby’s subsequent emotional/social and cognitive development. Belsky and Kelly’s study is a rich source of information in understanding the transition. The Cowans’ study is
the only controlled preventive marital intervention
study in the field, and they demonstrated a powerful intervention effect (of 24 hours of group
supportive therapy during pregnancy) in reducing
the drop in marital satisfaction, preventing divorce, and improving parenting quality. By the
time the child reaches age 5, however, there were
no differences between the experimental and control groups; it is still a mystery as to what happened to create relapse in the experimental group
between years 3½ and 5. Lewis’ (1989) landmark
work defines very specific prebirth marital ‘‘competencies’’ that provide links to child developmental outcomes through parenting.
Couples at midlife and beyond. Overwhelmingly,
the existing observational research on marriage
has studied relatively young couples. The data that
do exist on older marriages have been limited to
self-report data, derived primarily from questionnaires and interviews (Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick, 1989; Parron, 1982; Sinnett, Carter, & Montgomery, 1972; Guilford & Bengtson, 1979) with
some exceptions (Illig, 1977; Zietlow and Sillars;
1988). In the 1990s, this state of affairs began to
be remedied. Using an observational system for
coding emotional behavior, Carstensen, Gottman,
and Levenson (1995) studied the interactions of a
representative sample of couples in their 40s or
60s as they attempted to resolve marital conflicts.
With respect to negative emotions, the interactions
of older couples were clearly less emotional than
those of middle-aged couples. Older couples
showed less anger, disgust, belligerence, and
whining than did middle-aged couples. With respect to the more positive emotions, however, the
evidence was mixed. Middle-aged couples expressed more interest and more humor, but older
couples expressed more affection. Importantly,

<-----Page 4----->Marital Interaction

these findings of lesser negative emotion and
greater affection in older couples when discussing
marital problems still held when the authors controlled for differences in the severity of the problems being discussed. The reports of the couples
themselves were consistent with their behavioral
coding. When they showed spouses the videotapes
of their interactions and had them rate how they
were feeling from moment to moment during the
interaction, older couples indicated feeling more
emotionally positive than middle-aged couples
(Levenson, Carstensen, & Gottman, 1994).
THE CORE CONTENT AREAS
The Study of Power
It is fortuitous that in 1993 the late Calfred Broderick, originator of the decade review paper series
in this journal, published an important book titled
Understanding Family Process. Broderick organized family process literature, which he called
‘‘relational space,’’ into three major areas, the regulation of interpersonal distance, the regulation of
transactions, and the regulation of ‘‘vertical
space,’’ by which he meant power. The idea of
‘‘regulation’’ implied a homeostatic set point theory. In a therapy context, these three areas were
respectively discussed as positivity/caring, responsiveness, and status/influence (Gottman, Notarius,
Gonso, & Markman, 1976). We will briefly discuss these three areas. Historically, the regulation
of interpersonal distance was first explored by examining the clarity of communication. Hypotheses
were advanced to explore the role of unclear communication in dysfunctional families and family
distress. More specific hypotheses were advanced
that unclear communication was responsible for
psychopathology (e.g., Bateson, Jackson, Haley,
& Weakland, 1956; Watzlawick, Beavin, & Jackson, 1967), and the cybernetic model or the systems approach to family process was born. However, subsequent research over three decades has
shown that the regulation of interpersonal distance
is all about affect, not about communication clarity (e.g., Gottman, 1993). The regulation of transactions (e.g., signals of switches in speaking
turns) has been studied with strangers (e.g., Duncan & Fiske, 1977; Jaffe & Feldstein, 1970) and
has yet to be applied to the study of marital interaction.
The regulation of vertical space, that is, the
study of power has been much more elusive. It
was an area of important activity in the 1990s,

931

particularly as the study of physically abusive
marriages became a major focus of research attention. The empirical fabric of power always appears to disintegrate on closer examination. Broderick (1993) wrote:
Literally hundreds of studies have been done on
family power, who wields it and at whose expense. The matter has turned out to be complicated and elusive. As a result, the scholarly literature on power is voluminous, complex, and
often contradictory (see Szinovacz, 1987). The
great majority of these studies are based on questionnaires that ask the respondent to report on
who wins the most contested decisions in his or
her family. (p. 164)

Questionnaires filled out by independent observers do not correlate well, nor are different
measures well correlated (see Gray-Little &
Burks, 1983); nor have patterns of domination
proven stable over time (see Babcock, Waltz, Jacobson, & Gottman 1993). An older paper by
Gray-Little (1982) is noteworthy because it combined the observational assessment of talk time
during a 6-minute marital conflict discussion and
power during a marital game (the SIMFAM game,
Straus & Tallman, 1971). Results were complex
but included the result that balance in husbandwife power was related to marital quality; however, self-report and observational measures did
not show a high level of agreement in classifying
couples. The issues of blending the study of affect
and power are central to the integration of psychological and sociological approaches to marriage. As we will note, the issue of how to conceptualize and study power may become clarified
either through the use of more precise observational measures or the use of more precise data
analytic techniques using data from two people
that unfolds over time.
Power studied with more precise observations. An
example of this approach to clarifying power is a
recent study by Gray-Little, Baucom, and Hamby
(1996). They assessed power more precisely, using a coding of the couple’s influence patterns
during a discussion of the Inventory of Marital
Conflicts (Olson & Ryder, 1970). They found that
egalitarian couples had the highest Time 1 marital
satisfaction and fewer negative MICS behaviors
(Weiss, Hops, & Patterson, 1973); also, wife-dominant couples improved the most in a 12-week
marital therapy study.
Power explored in the context of gender and re-

<-----Page 5----->932

lational hierarchy. Feminist writers have pointed
to the central role that power must play in understanding marriages. Quantitative observational research has now begun to explore these ideas.
Women typically start most of the marital conflict
discussions in laboratories that use observational
methods (Ball, Cowan, & Cowan, 1995; Oggins,
Veroff, & Leber, 1993). The degree of negative
affect and the amount of criticism with which a
conflict discussion starts are also critical in determining its outcome. In one study, for example, the
way a marital conflict interaction began determined its subsequent course 96% of the time
(Gottman, 1994; Gottman et al., 1998, p. 7).
White (1989), in a sequential analysis using the
Raush, Barry, Hertl, and Swain (1974) coding system, found evidence for the contention that men
display a more coercive style in resolving marital
conflict, whereas women display a more affiliative
style. Ball et al. reported that couples perceived
the wife to be more important than the husband
in the mobilization phase of problem talk, which
involved raising the issues, planning on how to
solve them, being active and taking control by silence and nonresponse. Husbands and wives both
viewed this phase as the most stressful aspect of
marital problem solving. Men were perceived as
more influential in determining the content and
emotional depth of later phases of the discussion.
Women viewed their power in the early phases as
illusory: ‘‘their behavior was shaped primarily by
the effort to choose strategies that would avoid
upsetting their husbands. ’’ (Ball et al., p. 303).
Coan, Gottman, Babcock, and Jacobson (1997)
used sequential analysis to investigate the propensity of two types of physically violent men to reject influence from their wives during a marital
conflict discussion. The sequence of escalation of
the negativity (from complaining to hostility, for
example) was used to operationalize the sequence
of rejecting influence. As hypothesized, abusive
husbands whose heart rates decreased from baseline to the marital conflict discussion (labeled as
Type I abusers in the study), rejected any influence from their wives. These men were also generally violent outside the marriage and were more
likely to have used a knife or gun to threaten their
wives than abusive husbands whose heart rates accelerated from baseline to the conflict discussion
(label as Type II abusers in the study). These analyses were repeated for a representative sample of
nonviolent newlywed couples in the first few
months of marriage, and the escalation sequence
of men rejecting influence from their wives pre-

Journal of Marriage and the Family

dicted subsequent divorce (Gottman et al., 1998).
The sequence of women rejecting influence from
their husbands did not predict divorce. This study
was the first time that negative affect reciprocity
was broken down into responding negatively in
kind (e.g., anger is met with anger) or escalation
(e.g., anger is met with contempt). Negative reciprocity in kind was characteristic of all marriages; only the escalation sequence was characteristic of marriages that were later to end in
divorce. These findings reconceptualize negative
affect reciprocity as the rejection of influence.
Power studied with the mathematical modeling of
marital interaction. Power, according to Broderick
(1993), ‘‘may be most simply defined as the ability to win contested decisions’’ (p. 164). An alternative definition has emerged in the 1990s,
however, using mathematical modeling of marital
interaction. This alternative definition defines
power quantitatively as the ability of one partner’s
affect to influence the other’s affect. In this modeling (Cook et al., 1995; Gottman, Swanson, &
Murray, in press), two influence functions are
computed across the affective range of a conversation, one for the husband’s influence on the
wife, and one for the wife’s influence on the husband. This approach to modeling is based on writing down two interlocking nonlinear difference
equations for husband and wife, with influence
functions computed after controlling for autocorrelation. The method has a venerable history in
the marital field. Long ago, Anatol Rapoport
(1960, 1972) suggested that two linear differential
equations for husband and wife interaction could
describe a marital system as escalating out of control or being self-regulated. He never operationalized these variables or applied them to real data;
in addition, his equations were linear, and
unfortunately, linear equations are usually unstable. Nonetheless, Cook et al., applying the new
mathematics of nonlinear dynamic modeling (e.g.,
Murray, 1989), showed that depending on the
shape of the influence functions, couples can have
several stable steady states or ‘‘attractors,’’ that
are self-regulating, homeostatic set points for the
marital system. A homeostatic attractor is a point
in husband-wife phase space toward which the interaction is repeatedly drawn, and if the system is
perturbed, it will move back to the attractor. These
influence functions describe the impact of one person’s affect on the partner’s subsequent affect.
This determination is made across the range of
affects in the husband-wife dialogue. The influ-

<-----Page 6----->Marital Interaction

ence functions make the study of power more detailed and specific. Power may be specific to particular affects. Asymmetries in influence reflect a
power imbalance, and they reported that these
asymmetries were predictive of divorce.
Power and marital typologies. An important research monograph was published by Fitzpatrick
(1988) in which she presented the results of a series of studies that combined observational data
on marital interaction with questionnaire data. She
presented a typology of marriage from her analyses of ideology, communication, interdependence, and power dynamics in the marriage. Her
work was another example of the integration of
the study of power with marital interaction. In a
monograph on what marital processes predict divorce, Gottman (1994) also presented a marital
typology with three types, looking at interaction
and influence, and his types appear to be similar
to those of Fitzpatrick. On a conflict task Gottman’s types were validating couples, who are high
on conflict but wait a while in the discussion and
ask questions before engaging in persuasion attempts; volatile couples, who are high in conflict
and engage in persuasion attempts immediately;
and, Conflict Avoiding couples, who are low in
conflict and do not engage in persuasion attempts
at all. All three types were equally likely to have
stable marriages, but Cook et al. (1995) discovered that mismatches in influence functions between Gottman’s types predicted divorce. Noller
& Hiscock (1989) replicated most of Fitzpatrick’s
typology, except for a lack of effect of ideology
on traditionalism. Johnson, Huston, Gaines, &
Levinger (1992), however, developed a typology
(using diary data of work and leisure) and found
a very different typology with four major types:
symmetrical, parallel, differentiated companionate, and role reversed. The question remains as to
what fundamental mismatches in typology are
dysfunctional.
Vanlear & Zietlow (1990) related Fitzpatrick’s
couple typology, marital satisfaction, and relational control. ‘‘Relational control’’ attempts to capture the sequential communication of power or
status between spouses (e.g., from assertion to
dominance, from collaborative deference to submission). Across couple types, marital satisfaction
was associated with interactions confirming equality between partners (i.e., there was an absence of
putting self or partner up or down). More important, the study revealed an interaction effect between couple type and relational control on mar-

933

ital satisfaction. This finding, along with those of
Fitzpatrick and Gottman, further encourages researchers to challenge a uniformity assumption
holding that all distressed and nondistressed couples are alike in their reactions to specific interactional behaviors.
Marital Interaction as Proximal Determinants of
Family and Individual Well-Being
Historically, an important revolution took place in
the study of family processes when interactional
hypotheses were advanced to explain how specific
family interactions were related to and perhaps responsible for an individual family member’s psychopathology (e.g., Bateson, Jackson, Haley, &
Weakland, 1956; Watzlawick, Beavin, & Jackson,
1968). This marked the beginning of a major conceptual shift away from individual personality as
the primary determinant of personal well-being
and distress and toward social interaction with significant others as among the most significant determinant of physical and psychological well-being. We will examine the evidence to emerge in
the 1990s that represents the next evolution in this
30-year-old revolution.
Health and longevity. An outstanding review by
Burman and Margolin (1992) crystallized ongoing
work that the psychosocial quality of marriages is
linked to mortality and morbidity. In searching for
a mechanism for these linkages, they decided that
the effect is indirect and nonspecific. Previous research has identified strong links between marital
quality and health (e.g., c.f., Burman & Margolin,
1992), and between being married and better
health and longevity (e.g., Berkman & Syme,
1979; Berkman & Breslow, 1983). Research now
indicates that marital distress is associated with
suppressed immune function (e.g., Kiecolt-Glaser
et al., 1987; Kiecolt-Glaser, Malarky, Cacioppo,
& Glaser, 1994), cardiovascular arousal (e.g.,
Brown & Smith, 1992; Ewart, Burnett, & Taylor,
1983; Ewart, Taylor, Kraemer, & Agras, 1991;
Gottman, 1994; Gottman & Levenson, 1992; Levenson & Gottman, 1983, 1985), and increases in
stress-related hormones such as catecholamines
and corticosteroids (e.g., Kiecolt-Glaser et
al.,1994). There is extensive literature that indicates, that for men, marriage offers health-buffering effects (e.g., Berkman & Syme; Berkman &
Breslow; Bernard, 1982; Burman & Margolin,
1992; Shumaker & Hill, 1991) and that women
are more likely to experience health-related prob-

<-----Page 7----->934

lems if the marriage is distressed (Kiecolt-Glaser
et al.; Gaelick, Bodenhausen, & Wyer, 1985;
Ewart et al., 1991; Huston & Ashmore, 1986).
In the 1990s, researchers also broadened the
search for associations between marital interaction
and specific disorders. Many of these studies are
somewhat weak in methodology but nevertheless
point the way toward the benefits of more refined
study.
Child outcomes. The decade of the 1990s has been
rich in discovering linkages across interacting
subsystems within the family, and to the child’s
peer relations as well. The mediating variable in
many of these investigations is the concept of
emotional regulation of arousal in children, variously defined. Marital conflict, distress, and dissolution are linked to problematic childhood outcomes including depression, withdrawal, poor
social competence, deleterious health outcomes,
lower academic achievement, and conduct-related
incidents (Cowan & Cowan, 1987, 1992; Easterbrooks, 1987; Emery & O’Leary, 1982; Forehand,
Brody, Long, Slotkin & Fauber, 1986; Gottman &
Katz, 1989; Hetherington, Cox, & Cox, 1978;
Katz & Gottman, 1991; Peterson & Zill, 1986;
Porter & O’Leary, 1980; Rutter, 1971; Whitehead,
1979). For example, Cummings and colleagues
found that children exposed to angry interadult
conflict tend to use negative behavior such as
physical aggression to cope (Cummings, ZahnWaxler, & Radke-Yarrow, 1984). El-Sheikh
(1994) found that preschool children from highly
conflictual marriages displayed behavioral distress
and heart rate reactivity when shown tapes of angry adult interactions. Brody, Arias, & Fincham
(1996) reported a link between conflict-promoting
marital attributions (e.g., seeing one’s partner as
selfish) and ineffective parent-child communication and to the child’s attributions for negative parental behavior. Davies, Myers, and Cummings
(1996) showed videotaped segments of adults engaged in brief verbal conflicts, with various endings to two groups of children, 7- to 9-year-olds
and 13- to 15-year-olds. They reported that emotionally harmonious endings were crucial in creating a sense of emotional security in both groups
of children, regardless of whether the adults’ conflicts were about adult or child issues. Explicit
verbal resolution was unnecessary. Across both
age groups, female children reported more fear
whereas male children offered more task-oriented
interventions. See also Davies and Cummings

Journal of Marriage and the Family

(1994) for an attachment-based theory of emotional regulation.
Margolin, Christensen, and John (1996), in a
sequential analysis, reported that distressed couples showed greater continuance of tensions and
more spillover, particularly from marital to parentchild interaction. Nonetheless, there may at times
be an inverse relationship between marital conflict
and parent-child interaction. Mahoney, Boggio
and Jouriles (1996) found that mothers were more
empathic toward their 4- to 10-year-old, clinicreferred sons after an episode of marital conflict.
Gottman, Katz, and Hooven (1996) reported
the results of a longitudinal study in which there
were clear linkages between observed marital,
parent-child, and child-peer interaction when the
child was 4 years old. Furthermore, these linkages
were mediated by the child’s ability to regulate
physiological arousal during parent-child interaction. These linkages predicted a range of longitudinal child outcomes, including child peer relations at age 8. The central concept of this research
was ‘‘meta-emotion,’’ which refers to the feelings
and cognitions that parents had about their own
and their children’s anger and sadness. Katz and
Gottman (1993) found that two distinct and uncorrelated patterns of marital interaction were related to distinct child outcomes. A mutually hostile pattern (which predicted marital dissolution)
correlated with child externalizing behavior,
whereas a husband angry and withdrawn pattern
correlated with child internalizing disorders. Katz
and Gottman (1997) reported that variables that
index a ‘‘coaching’’ meta-emotion philosophy
buffer children from almost all the deleterious
consequences associated with marital conflict and
dissolution. Coaching parents are aware of their
child’s emotion, they listen empathetically to the
child’s feelings, they help the child find words to
express the emotion, and then they explore and
implement strategies to deal with the emotion.
There was a physiological substrate to this buffering effect. Katz and Gottman (1995) found that
a central child physiological dimension, called
‘‘vagal tone,’’ protected children from marital
conflict. Broadly, vagal tone is related to the ability of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system to calm the child down. The
concept has become central theoretically for many
researchers in organizing the bases for the infant’s
emotional and social development (e.g., Fox,
1994; Garber & Dodge, 1991; Thompson, 1994).
For a review on the heritability of vagal tone and
other autonomic indices, see Healy (1992).

<-----Page 8----->Marital Interaction

Rogers and Holmbeck (1997) reported that
more frequent and intense interparental aggression
was associated with greater adjustment problems
for children. They identified cognitive appraisal
strategies that were maladaptive for the children
and also noted that peer social support could buffer the negative effects of marital conflict.
Once again, after a hiatus of many years, links
were again being made in the 1990’s between the
marital relationship and child sibling relationships.
For example, among children aged approximately
4 to 9 years, Erel, Margolin, and John (1998) reported linkages between the wives’ negative reports of the marital relationship, the mother-child
relationship, and the older siblings’ observed negative interaction. The younger siblings’ negative
interaction was linked with the mother-child and
the differential mother-child interaction (across
siblings). No such relationship was found for siblings’ positive interactions.
Adolescent adjustment was also studied in the
context of couples undergoing the transition to remarriage (Hetherington & Clingempeel, 1992).
There were three groups of families: stepfamilies
with a divorced custodial mother who was in the
first months of a remarriage, families with a divorced custodial mother who had not remarried,
and nondivorced families. Authoritative parenting
was associated with positive adjustment of children in all family groups, but children in nondivorced families were more competent and had
fewer behavior problems than children in divorced
or remarried families. Nondivorced and remarried
couples looked similar on the observational measures. There was remarkable stability in marital
interaction over time; however, Deal, Hagan, and
Anderson (1992) noted that the new stepfather is
in a tenuous position in his new family, and ‘‘It
may thus be that the primary difference between
first marriages and remarriages lies not in the
quality of the marital relationship but in the relative importance of the marital relationship within
the whole family system’’ (p. 93).
Common comorbidities. Research in the past decade firmly established that marital interaction is
also strongly associated with a broad range of outcomes for family members. Although the direction
of cause and effect between marital interaction
and spousal or child well-being is often unclear,
the strength and importance of these relations documented in the 1990s will surely be pursued in
the next decade.
1. Depression. Schmaling, Whisman, Fruzzetti,

935

and Truax (1991) assessed the marital interaction
behaviors associated with wives’ depression. They
found that active summarization by the wife was
associated with fewer depressive symptoms and
the absence of a diagnosis of major depression.
Johnson and Jacob (1997) examined the marital
interactions of control couples and couples in
which either the wife or the husband was clinically depressed. Depressed couples were more
negative than were nondepressed couples, and
couples with a depressed wife were more negative
than were couples with a depressed husband.
McCabe and Gotlib (1993), in a study of depressed and nondepressed couples, reported that
depressed wives became increasingly more negative in their verbal behavior over the course of the
interaction, and they perceived the interactions as
more hostile. After breaking the interaction into
thirds, they found that only depressed couples
were fairly immediately reactive to their spouse’s
behavior in the interaction.
Biglan et al. (1985) discovered an interesting
set of interactions using sequential analysis, which
led to an exciting flurry of theoretically based research. They examined the potential ‘‘function’’
of depressed and aggressive behavior in depression, using sequential analyses. They compared
distressed and nondistressed couples, both of
which included a depressed wife, with community
control subjects. The findings suggested that the
marital system might be covertly maintaining depressive symptoms and thereby suggesting the direction of the causal relationship between interaction and individual outcomes.
Biglan et al.’s study was criticized because
they had difficulty obtaining nondepressed distressed couples. Schmaling and Jacobson (1990)
conducted the full design, crossing high or low
marital distress with high or low depression. They
did not find interactional patterns that were unique
to depression, but that these marital patterns were
due to marital distress rather than depression. Similarly, Nelson and Beach (1990) found that the
suppression of aggressive behavior was an artifact
of the number of months the couples had been
discordant. Interestingly, these means were long,
65.0 months for the nondepressed discordant and
94.5 months for the depressed discordant couples.
Greater suppression of aggressive behavior was
associated with shorter durations of discord within
both groups of couples.
2. Violence. This decade saw a huge increase
in observational research applied to the study of
violent marriages. Burman and Margolin (1993)

<-----Page 9----->936

used sequential analysis to compare the reenactments of physically aggressive, verbally aggressive, withdrawing, and nondistressed low-conflict
couples. Physically aggressive couples were characterized by reciprocity of hostile affect and by
rigid, highly contingent behavior patterns that
were stronger and longer lasting than those of other couples. Nondistressed couples also reciprocated hostility but were able to exit these negative
interaction cycles quickly. These sequential results
were also obtained by Cordova, Jacobson, Gottman, Rushe, and Cox (1993) for actual marital
conflicts in the laboratory rather than reenactments of conflicts at home. These investigators
designed elaborate procedures to guarantee the
safety of the abused women following actual marital conflicts in the laboratory. The data suggest
that violent couples are missing an exit or withdrawal ritual from either reciprocated or escalating hostility.
Gottman, Jacobson, Rushe, and Shortt (1995)
reported a typology of batterers based on heart
rate reactivity. Two types of batterers were identified: Type 1 men, who lowered their heart rates
from baseline to a marital conflict interaction, and
Type 2 men, who raised it. Compared with Type
2 men, Type 1 men were more violent outside the
marriage (to strangers, coworkers, friends, and
bosses), were higher on antisocial and sadistic aggression personality scores, lower on dependency,
and were more verbally aggressive toward their
wives during marital conflict; wives responded to
these men with anger, sadness, and defensiveness.
Type 1 men were more likely to threaten their
wives using a knife or gun, but both types had
inflicted as much actual physical damage (see Jacobson & Gottman, 1998, for more detail). In a
subsequent paper on divorce prediction, Jacobson,
Gottman, Gortner, Berns, and Shortt (1997) reported among their batterers there was a high divorce/separation rate of 38% and that husband
dominance and the wife’s reports of his emotional
abuse predicted the divorce. During the Time 1
marital interaction, more husband’s contempt, less
husband humor, less husband neutral affect, more
wife defensiveness, and less wife humor predicted
divorce. Physiological reactivity variables in both
husbands and wives at Time 1 also predicted divorce.
As noted above, the research on violence in
marriages has focused attention on the power aspects of marriage. In an unpublished dissertation,
Rushe analyzed marital transactions in terms of
power and control strategies and concluded that

Journal of Marriage and the Family

the violent marriage is basically engaged in a
power struggle, which is reminiscent of the analyses carried out by Coan et al. (1997) on violent
men rejecting influence from women. This notion
of violence as a form of power struggle is distinctly different from the emphasis on anger management for batterers in the therapy literature. The
power dimension of violence suggests a systematic use of violence to intimidate and control the
abused wife, instead of periodic uncontrolled outbursts (see Jacobson & Gottman, 1998). Babcock
et al. (1993) reported that violent couples were
more likely than nonviolent distressed and happily
married couples to engage in the husband demand–wife withdraw pattern. Also, within the domestically violent group, husbands who had less
power were more physically abusive toward their
wives. Power was measured by communication
skill using a structured interview about previous
arguments, and marital power outcomes was measured with the Who Does What scale (Cowan,
Cowan, Coie, & Coie, 1978).
Positive affect and social support in violent
couples have been studied by Holtzworth-Munroe,
Stuart, Sandin, Smutzler, and McLaughlin (1997).
They found that compared with nonviolent men,
violent husbands in the Bradbury social support
task (Bradbury & Pasch, 1994) offered less social
support than nonviolent husbands. Instead, they
were more belligerent/domineering, more contemptuous/disgusted, showed more anger and tension, and were more upset by the wife’s problem.
3. Chronic Physical Pain. Romano et al.
(1991) developed a methodology for the behavioral observations of chronic pain patients and
their spouses. Pain and control groups could be
discriminated with ratings of overt verbal and
nonverbal pain-related behaviors. Spouses of pain
patients showed more solicitous behavior than
control spouses. Turk, Kerns, and Rosenberg
(1992), however, reviewed evidence that suggested the complexity of the problem: positive attention from spouses to displays of pain were associated with reports of more intense pain, higher
observed pain frequency, and greater disability;
but, negative spouse responding to pain was associated with increased affective distress.
4. Hostility and Type-A Personality. Harralson,
Suarez, and Lawler (1997) studied cardiovascular
reactivity in hostile men and women (using the
Cook-Medley Hostility scale, Cook & Medley,
1954) and the suppression of anger. Medalie and
Goldbourt (1976) in a 5-year prospective study of
marital quality and health, found that a wife’s love

<-----Page 10----->Marital Interaction

and support was associated with a reduced risk for
the development of angina pectoris in husbands.
Sanders, Smith, and Alexander (1991) reported a
relationship between marital hostile/dominant behavior and Type A or Type B personality pattern
in both husbands and wives. Brown and Smith
(1992) found a strong relationship between hostility during marital interaction and heart rate reactivity.
5. Alcohol Abuse. Jacob and Krahn (1987)
used three analytic methods to cluster the marital
interactions of 96 couples (with the MICS) in
which the husband was either alcoholic, clinically
depressed, or a normal control. Cluster analysis
revealed that there were three salient dimensions
of the behaviors, negative evaluation, problem
solving, and positive evaluation. Jacob and Leonard (1992) performed a highly detailed sequential
analysis of these marital interactions. They found
that couples with a depressed husband were different from the normal controls and couples with
an alcoholic husband; couples with an alcoholic
husband and normal controls were characterized
by similar interaction patterns. Negative reciprocity was lower among the couples with depressed
husbands, and husbands were less likely to follow
their wives’ problem solving with problem solving of their own.
6. Drug Abuse. Fals-Stewart and Birchler
(1998) used their macro-CRAC coding system to
study the marital conflict interactions of couples
with drug-abusing husbands and a well-selected
control group of non–substance abusing but distressed couples. They thus controlled for distress
and varied only the active ingredient of drug
abuse. No differences were found between couple
types on the self-report inventories, but the couples with the substance-abusing husband interacted significantly differently than the distressed
non–drug-abusing couples: they showed higher
abusiveness, lower problem-solving skills, and
more attribution of blame than the distressed non–
drug-abusing couples. In addition, they found that
the CRAC total score was negatively related to
the husband’s percentage of days abstinent during
the year before entering substance abuse treatment.
Interrelationships Among Interaction Behavior,
Cognition, and Physiology
The 1990s witnessed the blending of multiple
measurements with observational measures in one
investigation, which makes it possible to ask more

937

sophisticated questions at the interfaces of these
three domains. Notarius, Benson, Sloane, Vanzetti, and Hornyak (1989) pioneered a methodology
for mapping the interface between perception and
behavior in their experimental investigation of
Weiss’s (1980) concepts of positive or negative
sentiment override and Gottman, Notarius, Gonso,
and Markman’s (1976) concept of editing. The
concept of sentiment override implies a discrepancy between a spouse’s subjective evaluation of
partner’s behavior and an outside observer’s evaluation of the same precise behavior. The valence
of any discrepancy between spouse and unbiased
observer in evaluating the partner’s behavior
would define positive or negative sentiment override. ‘‘Editing,’’ on the other hand, implies a precise sequence of interaction in which a spouse responds positively (or even neutrally) immediately
after accurately perceiving his or her partner’s behavior to be negative (i.e., the perception matches
an unbiased observer’s assessment of the immediate antecedent.) The important point is that these
salient interactional processes can only be studied
through an examination of the interface between
behavior and perception. Applying log-linear
modeling to the observational and subjective data,
Notarius et al. (1989) found a surprising similarity
among nondistressed wives and distressed and
nondistressed husbands. The perception of distressed wives was heavily under the influence of
negative sentiment override and these wives were
least likely to edit out a negative reply to the their
husbands’ negative interactions. In contrast, nondistressed wives and distressed and nondistressed
husbands were more likely to subjectively evaluate their partner’s negative messages as neutral or
positive and even when they made a negative
evaluation, and they were less likely to respond
negatively.
Bradbury and Fincham (1992) reported the results of two studies. In study 1 maladaptive attributions were related to less effective problem
solving behaviors (coded globally with rating
scales), particularly for wives. In study 2, a more
detailed coding system was used combined with
lag sequential analysis (Bakeman & Gottman,
1997; Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In this study,
maladaptive attributions (controlling for marital
satisfaction) were related to the reciprocation of
negative partner behavior (hostility or rejection of
partner’s views). Attributions and behavior were
most strongly related for distressed wives. Miller
and Bradbury (1995) found that maladaptive attributions were related to hindering problem res-

<-----Page 11----->938

olution on two tasks, a problem-solving and a social-support discussion. Attributions and behavior
were more strongly related for wives than husbands and for distressed than for nondistressed
spouses, again showing that cognitive factors
function to impair interaction.
Vanzetti, Notarius, and NeeSmith (1992) studied specific and generalized expectancies that couples had for the outcomes of marital conflict interactions. Distressed couples expected fewer
positive and more negative behaviors. Couples
high on relational efficacy chose relationship-enhancing attributions more often that low-efficacy
couples. Halford and Sanders (1990) used a video
recall procedure to assess cognition of each partner during both a problem discussion and a relaxed discussion. Both domains discriminated distressed from nondistressed couples, and negative
behavior in the interaction could be predicted better by accounting for both past cognition and behavior than by relying on past behavior alone.
Thomas, Fletcher, and Lange (1997), using a
thought stream video recall method pioneered by
Ickes (e.g., Ickes, Stinson, Bissonnette, & Garcia,
1990), in a study of empathic accuracy, had couples review their own videotapes and describe
their own and their partner’s ‘‘on-line’’ thoughts
and feelings. Partners’ assumed similarity was related to marital satisfaction and the positivity of
the verbal interaction. Mendolia, Beach, and Tesser (1996) found that the responsiveness to one’s
partner’s self-evaluations was associated with favorable marital interaction during a conflict discussion, whereas responsiveness to one’s own
self-evaluation was associated with unfavorable
marital interaction. These findings may suggest a
possible mechanism underlying defensiveness.
Fincham, Garnier, Gano-Phillips, and Osborne
(1995) developed a new methodology for studying
a couple’s preinteraction expectations and the ‘‘accessibility’’ of marital satisfaction. To operationalize accessibility, they used two computer tasks
and measured response latencies to specific questions about the spouse or the marriage. Response
latencies moderated the relationship between satisfaction and expected partner behavior for husbands.
Because there is considerable complexity in
studying each separate domain, it is not surprising
that work exploring the interrelations that exist between behavior and cognition is not well advanced.

Physiology and Interaction
The use of physiological measures in studies of
marital interaction has increased in the decade.
Ewart, Taylor, Kraemer, and Agras (1991), in a
study of essential hypertension, investigated high
blood pressure and marital conflict. They reported
that ‘‘not being nasty matters more than being
nice.’’ This was based on the finding that among
women, supportive or neutral messages were unrelated to blood pressure, but hostile interaction
and marital dissatisfaction were related. Among
men, blood pressure was related only to speech
rate. Levenson and Ruef (1992) reported a physiological substrate for empathy. They asked subjects to view a videotaped, 15-minute marital interaction of a couple and to indicate how a
particular spouse reported feeling. When the rater’s physiological responses matched those of the
target spouse being observed, the rater was more
accurate predicting the targeted spouse’s feelings.
Gottman and Levenson (1992) combined physiological assessment with observational coding of
interaction, specific affect, and the subjective
evaluation of affect. Using an index based on the
aggregate valence of all statements spoken during
a speaker turn, two groups of couples were
formed. The speaking turns of regulated couples
were characterized by a positive slope (i.e., speaker turns were generally characterized by positive
affect) over the course of a conversation, whereas
the speaking turns of nonregulated couples were
characterized by a negative slope (i.e., speaker
turns were generally characterized by negative affect) for one or both spouses. Wives in nonregulated interactions showed higher levels of arousal
than all other spouses; Gottman and Levenson
speculated that this heightened arousal may play
in role in the poorer health of wives in distressed
marriages. Gottman et al. (1998), using interrupted time-series analysis, found that only husbands’
physiological soothing (via self-soothing or
through wives’ humor) predicted marital stability
among newlyweds.
Smith and Brown (1991) related husbands’ and
wives’ MMPI cynical hostility scale scores to two
marital interaction conditions, one in which they
simply discussed a problem area, and one in
which they received rewards for trying to persuade their wives in a win-lose contest. In husbands their cynical hostility scores in the win-lose
condition was related to their own increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR)
reactivity. Husbands’ cynical hostility scores also

<-----Page 12----->Marital Interaction

were related to increased systolic blood pressure
reactivity in their wives. Wives’ cynical hostility
scores were unrelated to their own or to their husbands’ physiological responses. Brown & Smith
(1992) reported that in this win-lose condition,
husbands’ SBP increases were accompanied by
increases in anger and a hostile, coldly assertive
style. In wives, this same interactive style occurred, but it was not associated with their own
elevated SBP.
PROMISING TRENDS
Extension to Representative and International
Samples
There is a need to integrate sociological and psychological methodologies in the future. Psychological studies have relied on samples of convenience that have limited generalizability. A recent
exception is Escudero, Rogers, and Gutierrez
(1997), who, in a detailed microanalytic investigation also employing sequential analysis, studied
marital interaction in Spain. They compared clinic
distressed couples with nonclinic nondistressed
couples. They used the Rogers relational coding
system (Rogers, 1972), which directly codes power transactions, and the CISS for coding affect.
They found that clinic couples displayed more
domineering, more negative affect, and a stronger
association between one-up control and negative
affect than was the case for nonclinic couples.
Krokoff, Gottman, and Roy (1988) conducted the
only random sample study of blue- and white-collar marital interaction known to us. Among their
findings, there was more negative affect and negative affect reciprocity for unhappy couples, regardless of occupational status. Zamsky (1997)
compared the interactions of distressed and nondistressed, White and African American couples.
Replicating interactional findings on more homogeneous groups, Zamsky found large differences
between distressed and nondistressed couples,
particular for the negative emotionally invalidating behaviors. Surprisingly, communication differences between couples were not attributable to
factors of race, socioeconomic status, or any interaction between these variables and marital satisfaction.
Observational study of distressed and nondistressed couples continued in the 1990s to be used
in international settings. In studies in Germany,
Kaiser, Hahlweg, Fehm-Wolfsdorf, and Groth
(1998) showed that a short-term psychoeducation-

939

al program increased the frequency of self-disclosure, problem solving, acceptance, and nonverbal
positive behavior and decreased the frequency of
criticism relative to a control group. Hahlweg,
Markman, Thurmaier, Engl, and Eckert (1998)
showed that many of the changes in communication behaviors following the short-term intervention were maintained through a 3-year follow-up.
Gender differences have frequently been observed
in studies with U.S. couples (see Baucom, Notarius, Burnett, & Haefner, 1990), particularly concerning wives negativity, and similar differences
were observed in the German samples. At the 3year follow-up, wives in the treatment and control
groups were observed to display more nonverbal
negative behavior and more self-disclosure compared with their husbands, and wives in the control group displayed more criticism than their husbands.
In a study of distressed and nondistressed
Dutch couples, Van Widenfelt (1995) confirmed a
pattern of interactional differences that have been
replicated in several studies carried out in the
United States. She used the Codebook for Marital
and Family Interaction (Notarius, Pellegrini, &
Martin, 1991) to define interactional behaviors
and found nondistressed couples to display significantly more statements to facilitate problem
solving, to emotionally validate partner, and to
self-disclose thoughts and feelings and distressed
couples to display significantly more statements to
inhibit problem solving and to emotionally invalidate partner. Van Widenfelt also observed wives
in her Dutch sample to display significantly more
statements that were emotionally invalidating of
their husbands (e.g., criticisms, guilt inductions,
character assassinations). Sequential analyses revealed the interaction of nondistressed couples to
be characterized by statements that facilitated
problem solving, followed by self-disclosure or
emotional validation. In contrast, the interaction
of distressed couples was characterized by a high
frequency of emotional invalidation that was followed by statements that either facilitated or interfered with problem solving, but without any
consequent emotional validation.
Observing in Naturalistic Settings
Melby, Ge, Conger, and Warner (1995), in an elegant analysis, compared a marital discussion and
a problem-solving task and reported on the importance of task in detecting positive marital interaction. There have been very few studies of

<-----Page 13----->940

marital interaction outside laboratory settings, and
this is a direction that needs continuing exploration. An exception is Vuchinich (1985), who studied naturally occurring dinner-time disputes. He
found that in 200 examples of conflict, 67% ended
in standoffs in which no one yielded and the topic
was dropped. In 33% of the conflicts, the most
frequent reaction was withdrawal, in which one
person refused to continue the discussion. The reaction of submission, in which one person gave
in or compromised was rare. Nonetheless, even if
not naturalistic, laboratory observation may have
validity, particularly if it can be shown to predict
important marital outcomes. Older evidence
shows that interaction in the lab underestimates
differences between distressed and nondistressed
couples, compared with tape recordings made in
couples’ homes (Gottman, 1979). More recently,
Hayden et al. (1998) related the mealtime interactions of families to multiple levels of family assessment; the measures were strongly related to
both mother and father involvement. The use of a
marital interaction diary was pioneered in a study
by Halford, Gravestock, Lowe, and Scheldt
(1992) in an attempt to discover the behavioral
ecology of stressful marital interaction. For example, they found that most stressful interaction
occurred in the kitchen during the weekdays and
were associated with everyday life stresses; the
most stressful interactions resulted from one partner leaving the scene.
Focus on Sequences or Patterns of Interaction
Either through using various tools of sequence
analysis, or through the direct observation of sequences, the observational study of marital interaction expanded to the analysis of patterned communication. Probably the most important of these
patterns was the investigation of the demand-withdraw pattern. Most commonly, this is observed as
wives demanding change (through emotional requests, criticism, and complaints) and husbands
withdrawing (through defensiveness and passive
inaction). Christensen and his students pioneered
the study of this sequence (Christensen & Heavey,
1990; Sagrestano, Christensen, & Heavey, 1998)
and showed that this pattern was most likely when
discussing a wife issue and could be reversed for
a husband issue (Heavey, Layne, & Christensen,
1993). Given that a consistent finding is that women typically raise most of the issues in most marriages, however, this finding may be of only theoretical interest. Heavey, Christensen, and

Journal of Marriage and the Family

Malamuth (1995) demonstrated that the withdrawal by men and the female-demand/male-withdraw
pattern predicted decline in wives’ marital satisfaction 2.5 years later.
Demand-Withdraw Pattern and Power Revisited
The wife-demand/husband-withdraw pattern does
not imply that the wife is dominant in this interaction pattern. The husband’s withdrawal could be
driving the wife’s demandingness, for example. In
an innovative analysis, Klinetob and Smith (1996)
continuously coded demand and withdraw behaviors for both husband and wife. Using bivariate
time-series analysis and controlling for autocorrelation, they assessed the direction of influence
between demand-withdraw behaviors (and between withdraw-demand) in both husbands and
wives. They found that in the wife-demand/husband withdraw pattern, the overwhelming percentage of couples showed a bidirectional influence pattern (especially when it was her issue),
with wife dominance as the next most frequent
pattern. For the husband-demand/wife-withdraw
pattern, once again a bidirectional influence pattern was most common, with husband dominance
the next most frequent pattern (particularly when
it was his issue). This was an elegant approach to
the study of marital power.
The Importance of Positive Affect
Part of the accomplishments in the study of marital interaction over the last 20 years can be traced
to the use of common methodologies and data analytic strategies in independent laboratories
throughout the United States, in the Netherlands,
German, and Australia. One feature of the typical
paradigm was a focus on conflict discussions and
the negative behaviors that marked the interaction
of distressed couples in this context. As we enter
the next decade, interactional researchers have begun to look beyond conflict to better understand
the contribution that intimacy and other affectional processes makes to relationship satisfaction and
stability.
The importance of looking at positive affective
reactions is suggested by several studies of marital
interaction. Gottman et al. (1998) found that only
positive affect during conflict discussions in the
early months of marriage predicted both later divorce and the marital happiness of stable couples.
Pasch and Bradbury (1998) and Pasch, Bradbury,
and Davila (1997) studied social support in mar-

<-----Page 14----->Marital Interaction

ital interaction using a task of only moderate conflict in which spouses discussed personal, nonmarital issues. Longitudinal data showed that
wives’ ‘‘support solicitation and provision behaviors’’ predicted marital outcomes 2 years later, independent of the negative behaviors exhibited
during marital conflict. Beach, Martin, Blum, and
Roman (1993) reported that coworkers and marital quality played a significant role in reducing
negative affective symptoms (depression and interpersonal stress).
De Koning and Weiss (1997) studied the use
of instrumental humor and found that it appears
to function differently during the problem-solving
conversations of younger couples married an average of 14 years than during the conversations of
older couples married an average of 39 years.
Among younger couples, instrumental humor was
negatively associated with marital satisfaction, but
among older couples, instrumental humor was
strongly associated with marital happiness. The
authors speculated that humor many function as
an avoidance maneuver in the younger couples
and more genuinely represent positive affect in the
older couples. Cordova (1998) is developing a
promising behavioral model of intimacy. Intimacy
is operationalized as a dyadic event sequence in
which one partner’s expresses a personal vulnerability and the spouse responds in an accepting,
nonpunitive manner. Fruzzetti and Rubio-Kuhnert
(1998) found that intimacy, also assessed as a disclosure-validation sequence using Fruzzetti’s Intimacy-Distance Process Model Coding System
(1995), was significantly associated with relationship satisfaction and individual well-being, both
cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Clearly the
field is just beginning to explore the interactional
basis of marital intimacy.
Immediate Interactional Outcomes
Haefner, Notarius, and Pellegrini (1991) focused
on immediate outcomes of a single problem-solving conversation. Satisfaction with an immediately preceding conversation was primarily determined by partners’ positive behaviors, especially
wives’ emotional validation and husbands’ problem-solving facilitation. Dimitri-Carlton (1997)
also examined proximal interactional determinants
of conversational outcomes: Feeling supported
versus feeling undermined by one’s partner. Interestingly, a set of mild negative behaviors was
found to be most predictive of feelings of support
and undermining.

Personality Revisited
Karney and Bradbury (1997), in a longitudinal
study, examined the relationship between neuroticism, marital interaction, initial levels of marital
satisfaction and rates of change in marital satisfaction. They found that neuroticism was associated with initial levels of marital satisfaction but
not with rates of change in marital satisfaction.
On the other hand, behavior during marital interaction (total positive minus negative codes using
the Sillars [1982] coding system) was associated
with rates of change in marital satisfaction, but
not with initial levels. Kobak and Hazan (1991),
using an attachment theory framework with Qsort methodology, reported that the accuracy of
spouse’s internal working models as relying on
one’s partner and the partner being psychologically available were related to observers’ positive
ratings of communication in problem-solving and
confiding tasks. Sayers and Baucom (1991) studied the relationship between femininity and masculinity and marital interaction using the MICS.
Femininity was positively related to greater rates
of negative behavior among both husbands and
wives. A sequential analysis supported the idea
that wives’ femininity was associated with greater
negative reciprocity of the wives. Men’s femininity was associated with husbands’ tendency to terminate fewer negative sequences of behavior in
comparison with their wives. High masculinity of
the wives was related to shorter sequences of negative behavior.
Stress Spillover Management
In 1987, Jacobson, Schmaling, and HoltzworthMunroe conducted a 2-year telephone follow-up
study of the couples from their marital therapy
study. They studied two groups of couples, those
who maintained change and those who relapsed.
The only significant difference between the two
groups was in the management of stress from nonmarital situations to the marital relationship. Couples who relapsed had more spillover of stress into
the marriage than those who maintained change.
A Swiss psychologist, Bodenman (1997a) reported that ‘‘dyadic coping’’ with stress predicted longitudinal outcomes (stability and happiness) in a
2-year study of 70 Swiss couples. Bodenman has
developed an intervention program focusing of
dyadic coping with stress (Bodenman, 1997b).
This is an area that needs a great deal of development.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Behavioral observation of marital interaction contributed significantly to our understanding of marriage in the last decade. We would like readers to
carefully note that the construct of marital interaction might be assessed using methodologies other than direct observation. For example, a spouse
might be asked to report how often his or her
partner is critical. This question assesses a personal construction of the marital system; it does
not assess actual interaction. Given the cost of observational measures, it is all too tempting to
move back to less expensive methodologies. We
can see the pull to develop inexpensive questionnaires to assess theoretical constructs that have
been derived from careful observational study and
validated by cross-sectional and longitudinal
study. We believe this would be a mistake. Although it will be necessary to use self-report measures to tap phenomenological constructs of importance, we should not abandon the observational
methods that have contributed to the decade’s advances in understanding relationships. We must
strive to develop reliable measures of phenomenological constructs and anchor these measures to
the most reliable and valid data that we have
available on couples and families: the observation
of interaction. Observational measures will always
be most informative data source we will ever get
about process, which will be the richest source we
will ever have for describing and building theory.
