A Longitudinal Study to Assess the Most
Influential Entrepreneurial Features on a New
Firm’s Growth
Virginia Barba-Sánchez, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain
María Del Pilar Martínez-Ruiz, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain
ABSTRACT. In countries such as Spain, where over 95% of firms are SMEs and entrepreneurial failure rates
are high, around 50% of new firms do not reach the third year. Success factors, both for the creation of new businesses and their growth and consolidation, are of prime importance for supporting the economy, especially by
generating employment and wealth. This research paper therefore attempts to determine the most influential
entrepreneurial features on a new venture’s growth, which is measured in terms of an increase in the number of
workers. To address this issue, and in contrast to previous studies using transversal investigations, a longitudinal investigation has been conducted using a sample of 101 new Spanish small and medium-sized companies.
The empirical findings show some very interesting results. Firstly, the factor that has the single greatest influence on the additional number of workers employed by a company is whether or not the entrepreneur has been
an entrepreneur before. Secondly, entrepreneurial motivation has a non-zero effect on a firm’s success although
it does not determine if a company will succeed or fail. From these conclusions, some relevant guidelines and
future research lines are suggested.
RÉSUMÉ. Dans les pays tels que l’Espagne, où au-delà de 95% des entreprises sont des PME et où le taux de
faillites commerciales est élevé, environ 50% des nouvelles entreprises n’atteignent pas la troisième année
d’exploitation. Les facteurs essentiels favorisant la création de nouvelles entreprises, ainsi que leur croissance
et renforcement, sont d’une importance primordiale pour soutenir l’économie, tout particulièrement par la
création d’emplois et de richesse. L’étude suivante tente de déterminer les caractéristiques entrepreneuriales qui
jouent le plus grand rôle dans la croissance d’une nouvelle entreprise, laquelle est évaluée par l’augmentation
du nombre d’employés dans une entreprise. Afin de déterminer ces facteurs, une enquête longitudinale fut menée
auprès d’un échantillon de 101 nouvelles entreprises espagnoles, contrairement aux études précédentes qui
avaient mené des enquêtes transversales. Les résultats empiriques révèlent des conclusions intéressantes.
Premièrement, le fait que l’entrepreneur fut ou non un entrepreneur auparavant est le facteur qui joue le plus
grand rôle sur le nombre supplémentaire d’embauches chez une entreprise. Deuxièmement, l’esprit d’entreprise
joue un rôle non nul dans la réussite d’une entreprise, mais ne permet pas de déterminer si une entreprise réussira
en affaires ou non. En dernier lieu, les auteurs suggèrent des lignes directrices pertinentes et de futures avenues
de recherches à partir de ces conclusions.

Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
The changes that have taken place in the institutional European environment in recent
years regarding economic territorial policies have contributed to the increasing importance of small and medium-sized companies in economic regional development models.
Actually, the policies already developed in Europe have been oriented towards the creation, as well as the expansion of emerging small and medium-sized companies, since it
is important that firms compete in highly competitive conditions (Rusque, 2002; Urbano
and Veciana, 2001). In this context, the role of the emerging small and medium-sized companies in the economy is of great relevance, as well as their contribution to the generation
and maintenance of employment and social-economic development of the region where
they are located (Audretsch, 2002; Entrialgo, 1998; Hartigan, 2005; Hohti, 2000;
Heshmati, 2001; Barba and Martínez-Ruíz, 2006; Martín and Gaspar, 2004).

In order to launch new small and medium-sized companies, it is necessary that a variety of prerequisites regarding different aspects apply (i.e. human resources, industries
and services, financial resources and raw materials) (Cruz, 1984) due to the particular
characteristics of these firms. Among these prerequisites, the existence of entrepreneurial ability is of great interest. The absence of this ability makes it very hard to launch new
firms. The entrepreneurial ability can be seen as the availability of the people who enjoy
not only enough professional and entrepreneurial qualification, but also a favourable attitude towards the creation of a business (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Genesca and
Veciana, 1984; Rubio et al., 1999).
Psychological and sociological elements are also of great relevance since they determine the entrepreneurial potential of a certain geographical area. Some significant relationships have been detected in the academic field regarding this issue (Feeser and Dugan,
1989; Box, White and Barr, 1993; Jo and Lee, 1996; Entrialgo, 1998; Gartner, Starr and
Bhat, 1998; Stewart et al., 1999). For this reason, it is necessary to look further into the
study of the factors which are decisive when starting up a new business, especially aiming at designing adequate support policies focused on the development of a strong entrepreneurial culture (Díez de Castro et al., 1995).
Whereas there are different motivation theories that attempt to explain employee
behaviour in general, few academics have applied these theories to the study of the entrepreneur. The review of the literature proves that having an entrepreneurial psychological
profile makes a strong difference (see Table 1). Although the referred studies can not be

directly compared to each other since they differ in the variables considered, all of them
suggest the following as entrepreneurs’ features (Begley, 1995; Stewart et al., 1999): a
desire for independence, higher tendency to risk, higher need for achievement, locus of
internal control, and higher preference for innovation.
Another popular research line focuses on the study of the relationship between the
entrepreneurial motivation and the performance of the emerging company, measured in
terms of company’s growth through variables of increment both in human capital and
sales (see Table 2). The existence of a significant relationship between both variables has
been detected; however, the influence of the different entrepreneurial motivations on the
initial company performance is different depending on the research considered.
Finally, there are research lines which aim at inferring the positive correlations that
exist between the entrepreneurial motivation—considered as to what extent the founder
intends to invest his or her time, energy and money on the company project—and entrepreneur behaviour regarding issues like the strategy or the desire for company growth
(Dubini, 1988; Shaver and Scott, 1991; Miner, Smith and Bracker, 1992; Entrialgo, 1998).
Within this research line, a body of research attempts to model both the processes and the
variables included in the entrepreneur’s behaviour (Davis, Morris and Aller, 1991;
Davidsson, 1991; Herron and Robinson, 1993; Entrialgo, 1998). Among these variables,
the entrepreneur’s ability and motivation generally can be found.
This is the framework of our work, which attempts to analyze the relationship between
the entrepreneur’s features and the new venture’s growth, measured in terms of the
increase in number of workers. In order to achieve this goal and, in contrast to previous
studies using transversal investigations, we perform a longitudinal study, which is presented in section 2. After results are reported (section 3), the main conclusions, limitations, recommendations and further research lines are outlined in section 4.
Empirical Research
Barkham (1994) found that the most motivated entrepreneurs develop the companies with
the biggest number of employees. Guided by this premise, the present study attempts to
contribute to this research line by analyzing the relationship between company performance (measured in terms of employees) and the most influential entrepreneur features.
Hence, the main goal is assessing why some firms grow while others do not by searching
for the reason in the origin of the firm as well as in the entrepreneur’s motivation.
With this main goal, we have conducted a longitudinal study. In line with Hofer and
Bandgrave (1992), among others, this contributes to the relevant literature since these
authors suggested that it would be desirable to undertake a longitudinal study on a temporal basis of at least two years to analyze the influence of long-term aspects on new
firms’ performance. Since we intend to analyze the results obtained during the initial
years, the temporal dimension that Stuart and Abetti (1987) incorporate, as well as their
proposal of initial success, also seem to warrant research. For this reason, two series of
observations were developed from a sample of new Spanish companies1 recently launched:
the first series of observations were made during the starting process, and the second, two
years later.2 A total of 109 questionnaires were finally collected, 101 of which were properly accomplished, which represents a bias sample of 7.8% for a 95% confidence level.
_________________________
1. Data were collected in a particular region of Spain, La Mancha.
2. The information obtained from the first series of observations comes from the database of MINER (Spanish
Ministry of Industry and Energy), the IMPI (Spanish Institute for the small and medium-sized industrial companies) and the INE (Spanish Statistics Institute), whereas the information obtained from the second observation comes from a mail questionnaire previously designed by qualitative interviews.

The variables used in this research are shown in Table 3. Variable INTR was developed from two open questions that asked the entrepreneur about the initial number of
workers and the current number of workers, two years after the company had launched.
The variables NL, NI and ME are multi-item constructs, for which Likert evaluation questions were used on a scale 1–5, with 1 meaning “totally disagree” and 5 meaning “totally
agree.” Finally, EMP is a dichotomic variable.

In order to achieve the main goal, two objectives can be set out: identifying the basic
entrepreneurial motivation and determining the influence of such motivation on the initial
performance of the emerging business measured in terms of jobs generated—increment of
number of workers—during the initial years.
To obtain the first objective, 11 items were selected, guided by the criteria of
Solimossy (1997) and Martínez Sánchez and Urbina (1998), in order to measure the need
for achievement (4 items), the need for independence (3 items) and the economic motivation (4 items). All the previous characteristics are regarded as fundamental to starting
up a business (Scheinberg and MacMillan, 1988; Birleand and Westhead, 1994; Westhead
and Wright, 1997).

Finally, guided by the works of Birley and Westhead (1994), Jenssen and Kolvereid
(1992), Miner, Bracker and Smith (1992) and Solymossy (1997), among others, we
addressed the relationship between entrepreneurial motivation and performance measured
in terms of the increased number of workers in the initial years with regards to the following hypotheses.
Hypothesis Development
Jenssen and Kolvereid (1992) suggested that it is possible to determine the survival
chances of a firm by investigating the entrepreneur’s motivation to start up his/her own
business. However, there is no consensus with regards to the transcendence of such influence. While some authors (i.e. Birley and Westhead, 1994; Fesser and Dugan, 1989)
observed that the varying entrepreneur motivations as to the firm creation did not impact
the development of the business nor the generation of wealth nor employment, others (i.e.
Smith and Miner, 1985; Box, White and Barr, 1993) found that the motivation type influenced directly on the company’s growth measured in terms of the number of employees.
In this particular field, Driessen and Zwart (1999) observed significant differences
between the entrepreneurs who succeed and those who failed in terms of the following
characteristics: the need for achievement, the need for independence, the need for competence and the perseverance. Although not all these characteristics seemed to have the
same influence, the need for achievement influenced positively and significantly the company’s growth and survival. Bellu (1999), among others, reached the same conclusion,
detecting a strong significant relationship between the affective variables—motivation
models—and the cognitive variables—success attribution styles and failure. Johnson
(1990) found that the achievement need was not only related positively and significantly
to the employment growth generated by the business, but also with the sales increase and
profitability. Hence:
Hypothesis 1: The ability to create employment increases as the autoevaluation of
the need for achievement increases.
Martínez-Sánchez and Urbina (1998) concluded that the main reason to start-up was
not related positively to the company’s growth but to the lack of growth—understood as
indicative of the business success in terms of permanence (Driessen and Zwart, 1999). In
the same vein, Woo, Cooper and Dunkelberg (1998) observed that, for trade companies,
the need for independence along with economic motivations induced entrepreneurs to create firms that experienced quick growth and scarce stability along time, while the need for
achievement and the personal achievement contributed to create more stable firms that
grew slowly along time. Thus, the hypothesis contrasted by Cooper and Bruno (1997) or

<-----Page 8----->MARTINEZ.qxp

8/13/2009

1:25 PM

Page 261

INFLUENTIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL FEATURES ON A NEW FIRM’S GROWTH

261

Doutriaux (1984), among others, regarding those entrepreneurs who abandoned the
recently launched firm in order to create a new one was supported in the relevant literature. Accordingly:
Hypothesis 2: The ability to create employment decreases as the autoevaluation of
the need for independence increases.
The relationship between the economic entrepreneur’s motivation and the company’s
growth is not as direct as previously thought. For example, in traditional businesses managed by women, Anna et al. (2000) found that the business efficacy based on opportunities recognition and economic management, as well as the wealth expectations were positively related to the rent levels, and consequently, to the new venture’s success; nevertheless, for non-traditional businesses managed by women, the wealth expectations were
negatively related to the entrepreneurial success. Conclusions were also different depending on the company size. Hence, for entrepreneurs in small companies the economic motivations as well as the need for a job were the main reasons behind the company’s survival
and success (Díez de Castro, Galán, Landa and Leal, 1995). Consequently, taking into
account the characteristics of the considered business context in this research (most firms
are SMEs in traditional sectors), the next hypothesis is developed:
Hypothesis 3: Those entrepreneurs with the biggest economic motivations show a
higher ability to create employment.
Finally, Cooper (1971) highlighted the role of the incubator institution along with the
professional experience of the founder as determinants of the performance of the business.
The entrepreneurial motivation and the initial entrepreneur’s energy were also relevant. In
this particular context, Martínez-Sánchez and Urbina (1998), among others, found that
participation in previous business projects was positively related to the company’s growth
as well as to the level of initial formation, the commercial experience and the sector
knowledge. Hence:
Hypothesis 4: Those entrepreneurs with the highest professional background show
a higher ability to create employment.
Analysis of Results
Once all the relevant information from the sample was completely obtained, the entrepreneurs’ reasons leading to start-up were analyzed. From the average of all motivation constructs, it can be argued that the main reason for start-up is the need for achievement (average value = 14.3), followed by economic reasons (mean value = 12.89) and the need for
independence (average value = 12.89). This finding is consistent with previous research,
which had found that the need for independence is one of the most important of the entrepreneurs’ reasons leading to start-up (Díez de Castro et al., 1995: 244).
The hypotheses were contrasted with the following multiple linear regression models:
CGEi = β1 NLi + β2 NIi + β3 MEi + β4EMPi + ∈
(1)
Where,
CGEi is the ability of company “i” to generate employment, measured in terms of
increased number of workers during the initial years;
NLi is the need for achievement of entrepreneur “i”;
NIi is the need for independence of entrepreneur “i”;
MEi is the economic motivation of entrepreneur “i”;
EMPi is the professional background of entrepreneur “i.”

Table 6 also shows individual results. The left column includes independent variables
and the other columns show the parameter estimates, as well as the T-test results. As it can
be observed, the values and signs obtained for EMP, NL and ME are positive and significant, which makes it possible to accept hypotheses H1, H3 and H4. Besides, the value
and the sign obtained for the NI variable is negative and significant, which allows accepting hypothesis H2. The contribution of such variables to the model is not homogeneous
since βi coefficients differ slightly in absolute terms. EMP has the highest coefficient, followed by NI, NL and ME. Thus, the professional background (EMP) will have a higher
impact on the ability to generate employment, rather than economic motivations (ME).
All our hypotheses have been accepted showing that the professional background, the
need for independence, the need for achievement and the economic motivations influence
the increment in the number of workers. However, the factor that has the single greatest
influence on the number of employees a company added is whether or not the entrepreneur had been an entrepreneur before. Hence, the entrepreneurial motivation has a nonzero effect on the success of the firm, though it does not determine if a company will succeed or fail.
These empirical findings are consistent with those obtained in previous studies, not
only in Spain (e.g., Entrialgo, 1988; Serarols and Urbano, 2006), but also in other
European Studies (e.g., Dubini, 1988; Feeser and Dugan, 1989; Julien and Jacob, 1999).
Conclusions
This research obtains interesting findings and makes important contributions both for the
management of small and medium-sized companies and for the decision-making policies
of public administrative bodies. As the findings have shown, the motivation that encourages entrepreneurs to start up a new business, their commitment with the idea of the new
firm or the efforts they are willing to perform in order to start up the new business, along
with their flair for the process, are key in the start up of the new ventures. Keeping this
premise in mind, the new ventures are created not only by those who can do it –this is, by
the people that are able to do it –but also those who have the required motivation to do

that. Hence, the different bodies and entities interested in supporting new types of firm
(e.g. public entities, savings institutions, finance companies) should take into account this
fact and consequently, should incorporate the pertinent mechanisms to measure the commitment of potential entrepreneurs with their new ideas; especially with the goal of reducing the high rate of failure among these collective of firms and profiting the use of funds
and helps oriented to finance the start-up processes.
In particular, the professional background, the need for achievement, the need for
independence and the economic motivations significantly influence the new firm’s
growth. More specifically, the professional background has the strongest impact on the
ability to generate employment. Hence, the professional background is much more important than economic motivations.
The need for independence, the need for achievement and the economic motivations
also influence the increment in the number of workers. However, as mentioned previously, the factor that has the single greatest influence on the number of employees a company added is whether or not the entrepreneur had been an entrepreneur before. Therefore,
the entrepreneurial motivation has a non-zero effect on the success of the firm, though it
does not determine if a company will succeed or fail.
Our findings prove the convenience of incorporating new explicative variables, which
may include aspects regarding professional background or environmental characteristics.
Besides, other measures can be established to address the impact of the entrepreneurs’ reasons leading to start-up and performance of the company, such as the satisfaction with the
new venture, the sales increment, the benefit increment or the company survival.
In either case, the proposed model provides a rationale for the inclusion of factors that
determine the creation of a firm in order to define adequate support economic policies oriented to the development of values like entrepreneurial initiative, ability to assume risk,
creativity or innovation.
Within this context, education plays a role of great importance in the development of
entrepreneurial spirit among individuals (Blais and Toulouse, 1990). Recent efforts made
by certain universities and academic institutions, which include courses on business startup, are not enough. What is necessary, though, is the inclusion of this issue as an important subject from the lowest levels of education.
