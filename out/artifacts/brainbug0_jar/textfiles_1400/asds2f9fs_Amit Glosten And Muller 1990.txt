A number of issues that relate to the desirability and implications of new venture financing
are examined within a principal-agent framework that captures the essence of the relationship
between entrepreneursand venture capitalists. The model suggests:( 1 ) As long as the skill levels
of entrepreneurs are common knowledge, all will choose to involve venture capital investors,
since the risk sharing provided by outside participation dominates the agency relationship that is
created. (2) The less able entrepreneurs will choose to involve venture capitalists, whereas the
more profitable ventures will be developed without external participation because of the adverse
selection problem associated with asymmetric information. (3) If a costly signal is available that
conveys the entrepreneur's ability, some entrepreneurswill invest in such a signal and then sell
to investors; these entrepreneurs, however, need not be the more able ones. The implications for
new venture financing of these and other findings are discussed and illustrated by example.
(ENTREPRENEURSHIP; VENTURE CAPITAL; ADVERSE SELECTION; MORAL HAZARD; RISK REDUCTION)

1. Introduction
Numerous studies in the management and economics literature address qualitatively
important and fundamental issues about entrepreneurs, their activities and behaviors,
and the process of new venture formation. Baumol (1968), Drucker (1985), Kirzner
(1985), Leibenstein (1968), MacMillan, Siegel and Narasimha (1985), MacMillan, Zemann and Narasimha (1987), Rumelt (1987), Schumpeter (1942), Teece (1987),
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) and others elaborate on the roles of entrepreneurs,their main
characteristics, how they differ from managers, and the market functions of entrepreneurship. Relatedly, this literature also explores the essential elements of new venture
formation, how value is created through the entrepreneurial process, and how venture
investments are made by venture capital firms.
In addition, there are many descriptive field and empirical studies of the same issues
that provide insights about entrepreneurs, their ventures in both independent and corporate settings, and the activities of venture capital firms. (See, for example, Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984; Van de Ven, Hudson and Schroeder 1984; Timmons 1985; Brophy 1986;
MacMillan and Day 1987; Cooper and Bruno 1987; Day 1988; and a comprehensive
literature review by Low and MacMillan 1988.) Supplementing the descriptive and qualitative body of literature are manuscripts that provide rules-of-thumb and common wisdom criteria for developing new ventures (e.g., Brandt 1982), but which have no theoretical foundations.
However instructive, the received literature offers neither a predictive theory of the
behavior of entrepreneurs nor much in the way of guidance for practice. That it is important to fill both of these gaps is evidenced by the great increases in entrepreneurial
activity over the past two decades, accompanied by the high failure rate of new ventures.

In fact, a recent study (Bygrave, Fast, Khoylian, Vincent and Yue 1988) documents the
alarmingly low rates of return for venture capital funds. (The mean IRR was less than
10%by the end of 1985.) As investors may seek compound annual rates of returns in
excess of 70% for early stage financing, the reported low average return reflects the high
failure rate of entrepreneurial ventures. Among the intuitive explanations for this phenomenon are poor risk management by entrepreneurs, the availability to investors of
inherently less profitable ventures, bad luck, or the inability of the venture capitalists to
evaluate adequately the abilities of entrepreneursto turn their ideas into viable enterprises.
The purpose of this study is to investigate analytically these and other issues that relate
to the behavior of entrepreneurs, focusing on the decisions of entrepreneurs to develop
their ventures independently or with venture capitalists. Within a principal-agent framework that captures the essence of the venture capital/entrepreneur relationship, we examine a number of unanswered theoretical questions including: who decides to enter
into an agreement with outsiders? Why? How is this decision related to the unobservable
ability of the entrepreneur, the desire to share risk, or the need for capital? Would it be
worthwhile for the entrepreneur to expend resources to convey his ability to outside
investors before involving them in the venture?
2. Entrepreneurs and EntrepreneurialVentures
No clear definition prevails as to what constitutes the creation of an entrepreneurial
venture; however, the act of innovation that involves endowing existing resources with
new wealth-producing capacity (Drucker 1985) is central to the conceptualization. The
innovation that lies at the heart of the entrepreneurial activity is not restricted to a
technological invention which resultsfrom R&D or to an innovative cost-reducingprocess.
It may simply involve a new application of existing technologies, a product or a service
innovation, or a new way or place of doing business. Whatever form it takes, however,
there is a substantial amount of ex-ante uncertainty about the wealth-producing capacity
of the newly created capital. This uncertainty has two main sources. The feasibility and
market acceptance (or the production and demand functions) of the innovation and the
pace at which imitation will erode the extraordinary profit from the innovation are unknown ex-ante (see Kamien and Schwartz 1982; Teece 1987, Chapter 9). If the imitation
is instantaneous, then no surplus entrepreneurial profits will result. The source of the
entrepreneurial rents that may be inherent in the innovation is the rareness, limited
imitability and tradeability and importance to customers of the bundle of firm-specific
assets that are created by the entrepreneur.
Our conceptualization of an entrepreneurial activity suggests that it centers on the
entrepreneur's ability (talent, skill, experience, ingenuity, leadership, etc.) to combine
tangible and intangible assets in new ways and to deploy them to meet customer needs
in a manner that could not easily be imitated. This ability may be known to the entrepreneur but unknown to outsiders, such as venture capitalists. The inability of outsiders
to assess the venture founders' core attributes, namely their entrepreneurial skills and
abilities, may affect both the decisions of entrepreneursto involve outsiders and the prices
venture capital firms may be willing to pay for new ventures. Indeed, our discussion
explicitly considers this asymmetry of information.
3. Related Literature and Model Overview
Surprisinglylittle theoretical, quantitative, and rigorous literature focuses on decisions
of entrepreneurs to develop their ventures and the bases for entrepreneurial investment
decisions. In fact, the issue of involving venture investors does not typically arise because
research begins with the assumption that outside financing is required to develop the
venture (Chan, Siegel, and Thakor 1987; Hirao 1988). Presumably, at some cost to the

<-----Page 3----->1234

venture's future profits, an able entrepreneur might be willing either to forgo outside
investment or to borrow funds personally.
Kihlstrom and Laffont ( 1979) consider a related issue. In a general equilibrium framework under uncertainty, they focus on risk aversion as the determinant that explains
which individuals become entrepreneurs and which work as laborers. They implicitly
assume that all potential entrepreneurs are equally able, and find that, at equilibrium,
the less risk-averse individuals become entrepreneurs, while the more risk-averse choose
to become laborers. As not all potential entrepreneurs may be equally able or equally
industrious in the development of their venture, it seems useful to consider these attributes
along with the risk-bearing aspects of new venture formation in a formal analysis.
In our model, the entrepreneur is characterized as having some given level of ability.
He chooses the level of effiorthe is willing to expend and the level of capital investment
required to form the venture and to realize an uncertain payoff. Thus, the size of the
expected state-contingent ultimate payoff is a function of the ability of the entrepreneur,
the level of effort expended, and the capital invested.
In order to analyze whether the entrepreneurshould develop the venture independently
or with outside equity investors, we posit that a distinguishingfeatureof the entrepreneur's
reward system is the relationship between the ultimate profits from the venture and his
share. The independent entrepreneur is rewarded by the entire profits, whereas the entrepreneur who involves outsiders may only be rewarded by some fraction of future
profits. When equity investors are involved, we allow the form of the sharing agreement
of the ultimate payoff to be chosen by them. Indeed, the sharing of ultimate payoff
between the entrepreneur-manager and the venture capitalist, who both face risk, is
consistent with stylized facts about venture capital contracts. (See Chan, Siegel, and
Thakor 1987 for details.) Our model considers the risk bearing aspects as well as the
ability and efforts of the entrepreneur in determining the sharing arrangement.
Admittedly, we take an extreme view in that we consider the decision to involve
investors as an "all or nothing" decision. Once the decision is made, the entrepreneur is
assumed to turn over to the investors the right to determine the sharing arrangement.
The investors, in turn, maximize their profits by determining the entrepreneur's share
of ultimate payoff, the size of their new investment, and the entrepreneur's level of effort,
a point to which we shall return.
Our model is designed to predict which entrepreneurs will decide to enter into an
agreement with venture capitalists. We note here that our first result, using a model in
which investors are risk neutral and the entrepreneur is risk averse, predicts that every
entrepreneur will wish to involve outsiders. We find that as long as there is no private
information about the skill of the entrepreneur, entrepreneurs will sell out to investors.
This occurs because the risk sharing provided by outside participation dominates the
agency relationship that is created.
The prediction is strong, and armchair empiricism would suggest that such action is
not consistent with observed behavior, since some entrepreneurs do not sell out. Presumably they do not do so because they do not expect to get full value for their ideas,
either because of noncompetitive aspects in the capital marketsor because the entrepreneur
and outsiders have different information about the venture's potential. Our focus is on
the latter explanation. The conclusions of the analysis of the model with asymmetric
information are that: ( 1 ) As long as the pool of projects is good enough and the entrepreneur is slightly risk averse or his need for new funds is not trivial, there will always
be some entrepreneurs who will sell out; (2) If only a proportion of entrepreneurs sell
out, it is the less profitable ventures-those started by less capable entrepreneurs-that
are sold, whereas the more profitable ventures are retained by the more skillful entrepreneurs; and (C3
) Under certain circumstances, it becomes worthwhile for the entrepreneur to expend resources to convey his ability to outsiders before settling on a contract.

For the purposes of this study, we focus on the behavior of a risk-averseentrepreneur in
an independent setting who seeks to maximize expected utility of terminal wealth.
4. The Model
We follow the methodology of a principal-agent problem (Harris and Raviv 1978;
Holmstrom 1979), and let X denote the random profits from the venture, gross of any
new investment. The density of X depends upon the endowed skill level of the entrepreneur, denoted by y; his chosen level of activity (or effort), denoted by a; and the magnitude
of investment in the venture, denoted by I. Formally, letf( x: y, a, I) denote the density
of the profits evaluated at the realization x, for an entrepreneur with skill level 'y, when
activity a and a new investment I are chosen. We assume that larger values of y, a, and
I lead to a first order stochastic dominance relation. Thus, letting ,l(x; y, a, I) denote
the derivative of the density with respect to the ith parameter, f h(x)fJ(x; y, a, I) > 0
for any increasing function h( *) and for i = y, a, I.
First we formulate the problem of an unfettered entrepreneur. He has a utility function
U (increasing and concave) defined over future wealth. Furthermore, there is disutility
associated with choosing larger levels of activity a. We assume that the utility of wealth
and the disutility of the activity are separable. Thus, the utility of payoff x when activity
a is chosen is U(x) - V(a), where V(. ) is normalized so that it is zero when there is
no activity.
The entrepreneur who develops the venture on his own has the option of using his
own assets, or he may borrow fully collateralized funds (i.e., the lender is not making a
risky loan) to develop the venture. Let B(I) be the cost of raising I where B(I) ? I. A
strict inequality may hold when borrowing occurs. This entrepreneur therefore chooses
a and I in order to maximize expected utility given by
Maximize

B(I))f(x;

-

V(a).

(1)

Let u*( y) denote the maximum utility in (1), and let a, and I, be respectively the
optimal activity level and the investment chosen by the entrepreneur.
Should the entrepreneur choose to involve outside investors, we presume that the
following sequence of events occurs. The entrepreneur solicits bids for the company, and
takes the maximum bid w. This bid is a fixed amount of capital which is independent
of the entrepreneur's demonstrated skill and eventual profits from the venture. It is paid
to the entrepreneur in case he decides not to continue with the venture after the sale to
investors or in case the investors decide to relieve the entrepreneur from productive
control. If the entrepreneur stops managing, he is enjoined from pursuing the activity.
This amount w is commonly referredto as the buyout option in venture capital contracts
(Chan, Siegel, and Thakor 1987).
After accepting the bid w, the entrepreneur cedes the right of determining his share
of the ultimate payoff to the venture capital investors. As the entrepreneur's skill level
y will eventually be revealed, we assume that when the sharing agreement is made y can
be contracted on directly.' The risk neutral investors therefore determine their investment
level I, the entrepreneur's activity level a, and the entrepreneur's share of ultimate profits
s(x), so as to maximize their profits. This maximization is subject to the entrepreneur's
willingness to manage the venture after he sells out to investors and to an incentive
compatibility constraint on the activity choice. Consistent with the principal-agent lit' If the ability of the entrepreneur is not known when the sharing agreement is determined, then a revelation
contract (or sorting condition) that will induce the entrepreneur to report his true ability is required. It is,
however, beyond the scope of this study to consider a setting that includes the revelation game.

erature (Holmstrom 1979), the actual actions chosen cannot be observed. Specifically
the investors' problem is to maximize profits (the support of x does not depend on the

Assuming a solution exists, let NPV(w, y) denote the maximized value of the objective
function (2). Inequality (3) states that the entrepreneur is at least as well off after he
expended the effort a to develop the venture as he would have been had he walked away
from it with the buyout payment w. Constraint (4) insures incentive compatibility; that
is, it assures the investors that the entrepreneur will choose their profit maximizing level
of effort.
If, during the bidding, the skill level of the entrepreneur is known to the outside investors, then competition among potential investors will determine the bid w('y) which, as
long as the set is nonempty, satisfies
w(y) = max{w: NPV(w, y)O}.

(5)

It can be verified that NPV(w, y)-the maximized value of the objective function-is
continuous in w.
If the skill level of the entrepreneur is not known during the bidding, then competition
among investors will lead to a bid so that investors expect a zero NPV investment. This
expectation is taken over the skill level the investors expect to face.
5. Bidding with Common Knowledge
We first analyze the case in which the skill level is common knowledge during the
bidding for the venture. Our first result concerns the consistency of the model. We prove
that as long as the project is worthwhile to the entrepreneur-that is, u*('y) 2 U(O)
there is a w('y) which makes the investment a zero net present value one. The existence
of such a price is shown by arguing that if the investors pay zero for the venture, then it
is a nonnegative NPV investment. Furthermore, if they pay a very high price it will be
a negative NPV investment. By continuity, there is a w that makes the venture a zero
NPV investment.
PROPOSITION1. Assume that for a skill level -y, the entrepreneulr
finds the ventulre
attractive; that is, u*( y) ? U(O). Then there exists a nonnegative w('y) satis/fying
NPV(w(y), y) = 0.

PROOF. See the Appendix.
Having established the consistency of the relationship between the investors and the
entrepreneur, we now address the issue of the entrepreneur's decision to sell out. Before
presenting the result, we note the intuitively appealing observation that NPV (w, y) is
nonincreasing in w, because increasing w increases the minimum utility that the entrepreneur must enjoy. This imposes a direct cost on the investors.
LEMMA 1. Thefunction NPV( w, y), the present value ofthe investmentto the investors,
is decreasing in the payment w.

Q.E.D.

We next show that every entrepreneur facing competitive investors will choose to sell
out. The result is derived by showing that a feasible strategy for the investors is to offer
a compensation contract which mimics the payoffs the entrepreneur could expect on his
own. However, the investors can construct a better contract by absorbing some of the
risk. Thus, if the investors could offer an amount which would lead to the entrepreneur's
indifference between selling out and developing the venture alone, the investment would
be a nonnegative NPV investment. Since the competitive bidding insures that the investment will be a zero NPV investment, the investors in equilibrium will offer more
than the amount needed to make the entrepreneur indifferent between retaining the
venture and selling.
PROPOSITION 2. Assuimingthat ability level is common knowledge at the time of the
bidding, every entrepreneuirwillfind it optimal to sell off thefirm. That is,

Q.E.D.

We note several aspects of this result. First, the need for new investment is not critical
to the results; it makes them stronger. The incentive to share risk is large enough to make

<-----Page 7----->1238

RAPHAEL AMIT, LAWRENCE GLOSTEN AND EITAN MULLER

the proposition true even if the density of the profits does not depend upon the new
investment I. Strict preference does depend upon risk aversion. If the entrepreneur is
risk neutral, then we know that the first best can be obtained in the principal-agent
problem as well as when the entrepreneur works alone. Thus, if the entrepreneur is risk
neutral, he is indifferent between retaining the firm or selling out. Of course, if the entrepreneur is risk neutral but faces difficulty in raising new investment (i.e., B(I) > I),
then he will prefer to sell out. In such a way, the first best is obtained with the optimal
amount of new investment, which is better than developing the venture without external
participation.
Furthermore,it can be verifiedthat the utility achieved by the entrepreneurwho involves
outside investors in the venture is equal to the utility achieved if competition among
investors solves the following problem:2

(6b)

It should be noted that the entrepreneur need not enjoy limited liability; that is, s(x)
is not restricted to being nonnegative. Certainly, the entrepreneur has no interest, ex
ante, in insisting upon limited liability. This can be seen by noting the equality of the
utility achieved in our modeling of the relationship and that of Chan, Siegel and Thakor.
Restricting s(x) to be nonnegative in the second formulation (problem (6)-(6b)) will
lead to no greater expected utility, and if the nonnegativity constraint is binding there
will be lower expected utility. On the other hand, our failure to restrict s(x) may be
inconsistent with bankruptcy law. That is, the contract may not be enforceable in states
in which s(x) is negative. The results above will go through if we restrict s(x) to be
greater than or equal to [x -- B(Ie)], where x is the smallest possible realization of X.
That is, if the entrepreneur's problem, as we have formulated it, is consistent with bankruptcy law, then s(x), so restricted, is consistent with bankruptcy law (and hence enforceable) and our results remain intact.
6. Bidding with Asymmetric Information
Since entrepreneurs do not always sell out, another explanation must be sought. We
suspect that it lies in private information about the skill level. The problem can be seen
by considering an extreme case. Suppose the entrepreneur is risk neutral and there is no
need for new investment. If the investors price the firm based on the average skill level,
then only those entrepreneurswith ability below the average will sell out. The investment
will then be a poor one. No matter what price is set during the bidding, only those whose
abi]ity is worse than the investor-perceived expected ability of the entrepreneur will sell
out. Consequently, the adverse selection problem is so severe that there will never be
any selling out. If the entrepreneur is risk averse, then the market may not break down
completely. In this case, some entrepreneurs may sell out while others may develop the
venture on their own.
We show that, as long as the entrepreneursare somewhat risk averse and the minimum
skill level is not too low, some or all entrepreneurs will sell out. If only some sell out,
2 This is the formulation adopted by Chan, Siegel and Thakor ( 1987).

<-----Page 8----->ENTREPRENEURIAL ABILITY, VENTURE INVESTMENTS, AND RISK SHARING

1239

they will be those with lower skill levels. The investors will still find that, on average, the
purchase of the ventures is a zero NPV investment, but the price will be relatively low
and the ventures will not be outstanding performers.
To describe the environment with informational asymmetry, we need some further
assumptions and notations. Assume that from the perspective of the investors, 'y is distributed on some interval [Y, fl. Further, assume that u *(^y) 2 U(O). Finally,3 we
assume that NPV(w, ^y)is increasing in ^y.
Define wvby U( w) = u *(Qy);that is, w > 0 is the amount needed to get the most skillful
entrepreneur to sell out. Further, define w by U(w) = u*(^y);that is, w ? 0 is the amount
needed to get the least skillful entrepreneurto sell out. Note that u*( ^y)is strictlyincreasing
in -y, so that the entrepreneur with skill level zywill sell out for w if zy ? u '( U( w)).
Let e(w) denote the investor's expectation function:
e(w) = E[ NPV (w, ^y)Ientrepreneur sells for w].
No entrepreneurwill sell out for less than w, so the investors' expectation function e( w)
for w 2 w is given by
w =w

NPV(w,1y),

oy)],

Equilibrium in the asymmetric information case is'
w* = Max (w: e(w) = 0).

(8)

Define ^y*to be such that u*( y*) = U(w*). If ^y> ^y*the entrepreneur will not sell,
while if ^y< ^y*the entrepreneur will sell.
PROPOSITION 3. If the expectationfinction e( w) is continuioulsin w, then there exists
a bid w* such that e( w*) = 0, and it is larger than the bid that will yield a zero NPV,for
the venture with the least skillful entrepreneur,which is larger than the bid needed to get
the least skillful entrepreneuirto sell out, i.e., w* 2 w(^y) 2 w.
PROOF.

Note that

e(w*(^Y)) = E[NPV(w(Y),

^y)It*(Qy) ' U(w(^y))]

2

NPV(w(^Y), y) = 0.

Furthermore, if w is very large, e(w) is E[NPV(w, zy)], which can be made negative
(see Proposition 1). Hence, by continuity of e(w) there exists w* satisfying e(w*) = 0.
Furthermore, w* > wQ(y)2 w (by Proposition 2). Q.E.D.
If NPV( w, ^y)is strictly positive, as will be the case if the entrepreneur is risk averse
or if he faces additional costs of obtaining new financing, then w* will be strictly greater
than w, and hence y* will be strictly greater than ^y.That is, the venture capital market
does not break down completely in that there will be some interval of entrepreneurs
(indexed by their skill level) who will sell out to investors.
The intuitive explanation of why there is not a complete breakdown of the market is
as follows. Suppose the investors start out anticipating the worst and bid w(^y). Then
they know they will attract entrepreneurs with the lowest skill level, but they also know
they will attract risk-averse entrepreneurs with a higher skill level. Thus, they expect
positive profits at w(^y)and hence w* will be set higher in equilibrium.
3It can be shown that NPV(w, y) is increasing in y if f(x; y, a, I) = h(x; g(y, a, I)) where gaa < 0 and
gaor? 0.
4There may be several bids w satisfying E( w^) 0. We assume that competition will lead to the largestbeing
chosen.

<-----Page 9----->1240

RAPHAEL AMIT, LAWRENCE GLOSTEN AND EITAN MULLER

The assumption that the venture is worthwhile even for the least skillful entrepreneur
is an important one for showing that some entrepreneurs will sell out. If this is not the
case, then (following the formalism above) w could be negative as could be w*. But in
this case, entrepreneurs will either quit or continue the venture on their own.
It is logically possible for there to be no market breakdown whatsoever, i.e. w* >- Wi.
This will occur if there is relatively little uncertainty about -y, or if entrepreneurs are very
risk averse, or if personal borrowing is very costly for the entrepreneur.
7. Information about EntrepreneurialAbility
In the asymmetric information case we observed that an entrepreneur with ability.y
will not sell out if y > y*. Recall that zy*corresponds to the equilibrium bid w*. Note
that w* was established in an informational setting in which investors were not able to
assess the entrepreneur's unique ability. The entrepreneur may find it worthwhile to
invest in accurate and verifiable information about his skill level if the technology for
generating such a signal is available and affordable. We now turn to the question of who
will generate a perfectly revealing signal that eliminates information asymmetries and
then sell to investors.
We assume that the perfectly revealing signal can be generated at a cost C. It is obvious
that an entrepreneur will not plan to generate a signal and then develop the venture
alone. Consequently, there are three possibilities: sell without a signal for some amount
w* *, generate a signal and sell for the resulting competitive bid (which is a function of
^y),and develop the venture alone without generating a signal.
If an entrepreneur invests in a signal and sells the venture, he will get utility U( wi(y,
C)), where wv(iy,C) is derived below. After seeing the signal, investors know that if they
obtain rights to the venture they will solve

We first investigatethe relation between w* and w* *. Intuitively, if the signal is feasible,
then the investors face an additional adverse selection problem. The case of an entrepreneur wishing to sell without a signal may be worse for investors than that of an
entrepreneur wishing to sell when a signal is not an option. The proof is in the following
proposition.
PROPOSITION 4. The bid when a signal is not an option,, w*, is not smaller than the
bid when a signal is an option, w* *; i.e. w* > w.

PROOF. Define M(^y) = Max [U(wvi({y,C)), u*(^y)]. If an entrepreneur chooses to
sell at some w without a signal, it must be that U(w) ? M(,y). Note that for any w the
set {zy:U( w) ? M( y) } is contained in the set {zy:U( w) ? u*( ,y) }. Since M( y) is increasing
in -y, we have that

E[NPV(w, zy)jU(w)

?

M(^y)] ? e(w),

where e(w) is defined by (7). Since w* is the largest w such that e(w) is zero, and since
if w is very large, e( w) < 0, we have that
E[NPV(w,

M(^y)] < e(w) < O

y)U(w)

w > w.

Thus, w* < w*. Q.E.D.
The equilibrium bid w* * made when a signal is possible but not offered (as in (9))
can, however, be equal to w*, the equilibrium bid made when no signal is possible (as
in (8)). If an entrepreneur with ability y* (recall that we defined y* to be such that
uj*( y*) = U( w*)) weakly prefers developing the venture alone to generating the signal
and selling, w* and w* * will be equal. Intuitively, if this condition is satisfied, then at
w*, the entrepreneur is indifferent between selling without an entrepreneurial ability
signal and developing the venture alone. But this is preciselythe condition that determines
w*, and hence w* * will equal w*. Thus we have
COROLLARY 1.

Q.E.D.

In the setting of Corollary 1, the two bids are the same. However, they are not in
general equal. In particular,suppose that the signal is costless. Failure to provide a costless
signal tells the investors that the entrepreneur is worse than the average. That is, if a bid
is offered so that the entrepreneurs who sell are the ones whose ability is low, then the
investors lose money. Thus, the only way they can protect themselves is to make a bid
based on the profitability of the least skillful entrepreneur. But if this is the case, then all
but the least skillful entrepreneurs will choose to generate a signal.
5. If the cost of the signal is zero, then all entrepreneurswill prefer to
generate the signal. That is, w* * = w(y).

Figure 1 presents various possibilities for the relation between the entrepreneur'sutility
when a report is generated at some positive cost (i.e., U(wv( y, C)) and the entrepreneur's
utility derived from developing the venture alone (u*( y)). The figures illustrate several
intuitively appealing results. First, if the signal is very inexpensive, then we would expect
the situation to be as depicted in a,. In this case, all entrepreneurs sell, but lower skill
entrepreneurs do so without signalling their ability. Recall from the above proposition
that if the cost is in fact zero, all entrepreneurs will generate the signal. The opposite
situation is depicted in bl, a case in which the signal is very expensive. This situation is
identical to the situation in which generating the signal is impossible.
The remaining illustrations in Figure 1 describe intermediate cases. Note that it is not
a general result that high-ability entrepreneurs necessarily generate the signal nor necessarily develop the project alone (compare the cases in a2 and b2). In all cases, there is
an interval of low-ability entrepreneurswho choose to sell without the signal. The intuitive
explanation for this result is the same as that which accounts for the interval of lowability entrepreneurs who choose to sell out when no ability signal is possible. That is,
given the equilibrium price, the utility of such low-ability entrepreneurs exceeds their
utility had they chosen to develop the venture alone.5

8. Conclusions and Implications
In the analytical model an uncertain payoff from an entrepreneurialventure is assumed
to depend on the ability of the entrepreneur,the effortsdevoted to developing the venture,
and the amount of capital that is invested. In considering the desirability of financing,
entrepreneurs-who are assumed to know their abilities-seek to share risk and raise
capital. While the entrepreneurs' abilities are a critical determinant of the ultimate payoff
from the venture investment, the venture capitalists may be unable to assess accurately
this ability when pricing the deal. This raises both moral hazard and adverse selection
problems which we addressed by considering three informational settings.
First, we assumed that the entrepreneur's abilities are common knowledge. We found
that all risk-averseentrepreneurschoose to involve risk-neutral venture capital investors,
since the risk sharing provided by such outside participation dominates the agency relationship that is created. In the second setting we assumed asymmetry of information
with respect to the entrepreneur's ability. That is, the entrepreneur knows his skill level
while the venture capitalist does not. In this setting we found that because of the adverse
selection problem that is created, it is the less profitable ventures-those started by less
capable entrepreneurs-that are sold, whereas the more profitable ones are retained by
the more skillful entrepreneurs. The investors will still find that, on average, the purchase
of such ventures is a zero NPV investment, but the price will be relatively low, and the
ventures will not be outstanding performers.
In the third informational setting we assumed that asymmetry of information exists,
but that it is possible for the entrepreneur to invest in information that will reveal his
skill level. The analysis of this setting suggests that there will always be some selling out
by the less skillful entrepreneurs who do not generate a signal about their abilities. Also,
we find that the equilibrium price for ventures that are sold without using an available
signal will always be less than, or equal to, the price for ventures that are sold to investors
when a signal is not possible. The equilibrium prices will be just equal when the cost of
generating a signal is so high that not producing it has no informational implications
about the ultimate profitability of the venture. We also find that when the signal is
costless, all entrepreneurs will choose to produce a signal about their abilities, and the
equilibrium price will be the one that yields zero NPV for the least skillful entrepreneur.
Additionally, we find that it is not a general result that high-ability entrepreneurs either
necessarily generate a signal or necessarily develop the venture alone.
The analysis presented leaves many unanswered theoretical and empirical issues. For
instance, one might consider a setting in which a costly signal could be generated to
reduce, but not to eliminate, the informational asymmetries about the entrepreneur's
abilities. A model with incomplete signals may be particularly interesting in a dynamic
setting in which the venture capitalist gradually learns about the entrepreneur's ability.
Other theoretical extensions include the formulation and analysis of models that capture
additional aspects of the adverse selection problem such as the revelation game, as well
as the bargaining issues associated with negotiating the venture capital contract.
Our model helps explain the poor return of venture capital investments as reported
by Bygrave et al. ( 1988). We found that while the equilibrium price paid for new ventures
is the one for which the expected NPV equals zero, there will be less skillful entrepreneurs
that will receive funding. The implication of this observation is that, to the detriment of
entrepreneurs, the resistance of venture capital firms to raise prices paid for new ventures
is indeed justified.6

Appendix
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1. Consider NPV(0, y). A feasible contract, investment, and action triple is s(x)
x - B(Ie), Ie, a, (recall that I, and a, are the solutions to the entrepreneur's problem). This triple is feasible

since it satisfies the constraints of the investors' problem (3)-(4),
f

U(s(x))f(x;

-y, ae, Ie) - V(a,)

and by definition a, maximizes

Ie = B(I,) -

Let so, ao, Io be the first best solution when w is paid, and let G(w, -y) be the maximized net present value
of the first best problem:

U(s(x))f(x;

ry,a, I) - V(a) 2 U(vW
),

Pointwise maximization implies that so(x) must satisfy X = 1/ U'(s?(x)) and hence so is constant and positive.
Note that from the constrained maximization we obtain
GU'(s?)

- U'(w)

In order to satisfy the constraint of the first best problem, so > w, and hence, U'(s?) < U'( w). This, in turn,
implies that G,,( w, -y) < -1. Therefore, when w is large enough, G( w, -y) is negative. Since NPV( w, -y) < G( w,
-y), NPV ( w, -y) must be negative for a sufficiently large wv.Continuity proves the existence of w*( -y), for which
NPV(w(-y), y) = 0. Q.E.D.
