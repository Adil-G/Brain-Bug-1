<-----Page 0----->A framework for understanding opportunity recognition:
entrepreneurs versus private equity financiers
Journal of Private Equity
The screening and evaluation of business opportunities submitted by entrepreneurs is a major component of
the decision-making process employed by private equity financiers (such as venture capitalists) when they
decide whether or not to invest in a new venture (Mainprize, Hindle, and Mitchell [2002]). These financiers
believe they know the "right" cues for predicting the outcome of a business opportunity; however, research
indicates that the results of their decisions are poor (Zider [1998]).
Opportunities stem from the perceptions of decision makers; they are a consequence of making sense of
situations (Gartner and Shaver [2002]). Opportunities have the qualities of being attractive, durable, and
timely and are anchored in products or services that create or add value for their buyers or end users
(Timmons [1999]). The most successful entrepreneurs and private equity financiers of entrepreneurial
ventures are opportunity focused. They start with what customers and the market want and do not lose sight
of this (Timmons [1999]). Undertaking formalized market research provides useful information in this
regard; however, intuition or "gut feel" based on experience is extremely important in judging market
potential (Hills and Shrader [1998]).
Research into "opportunity evaluation" has been addressed substantially in the academic literature; however,
research into "opportunity recognition" has received less attention (Hills, Lumpkin, and Singh [1997]).
Researchers are now beginning to focus more on opportunity recognition as an important part of the
entrepreneurial process. Very little is known about the sensitivity of entrepreneurs to opportunities, the
cognitive processes they use to identify opportunities, or their self-perceptions regarding this phenomenon
(Hills, Shrader, Baltrusaityte, and Izberk-Bilgin [2002]). The same applies to private equity financiers though
there has been recent interest in the decision-making processes of these types of individuals (see, for
example, Farrell and Howorth [2002]).
This study builds upon previous research undertaken by Hills [1995], Hills, Lumpkin, and Singh [1997], and
Hills and Shrader [1998] that focused on understanding how entrepreneurs recognize business opportunities.
It extends the previous research by examining differences in the opportunity recognition process between
experienced or habitual entrepreneurs (see, for example, Ucbasaran and Westhead [2002]) and experienced
private equity financiers of entrepreneurial ventures. We define experience in an entrepreneurial context in
terms of knowledge, skills, and/or know-how gained by an individual who, over the last 10 years, either has:
1) founded more than one high-growth-potential entrepreneurial business; or 2) been actively involved in
making investment decisions about providing private equity finance to high-growth-potential entrepreneurial
businesses. In this research, private equity providers include venture capitalists (professional, formal
investors of institutional money), business angels (private or informal investors who tend to invest their own
money and often their time), and investment managers who work in the private equity division of banks that
provide finance to high-growth-potential entrepreneurial ventures in return for equity positions in those
ventures. Entrepreneurs were defined as individuals who had recognized an opportunity and who had brought
together the necessary resources to take advantage of that opportunity (Christensen, Madsen, and Peterson
[1989], Bygrave and Hofer [1991], and Hills, Lumpkin, and Singh [1997]).
ENTREPRENEURS AND OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION
The recognition and exploitation of business opportunities in the market are core functions of
entrepreneurship (see, for example, Schumpeter [1971]; Kirzner [1979]; Casson [1982]; Hills and Shrader
[1998]). Yet, many would-be entrepreneurs fail to recognize opportunities. Timmons [1990] estimated that
only 1 in 30 business ventures had founders that were good enough at opportunity identification and
development to be able to grow their ventures to at least $1 million in sales turnover.

<-----Page 1----->Entrepreneurs are notably overly optimistic in their assessment of business opportunities (see, for example,
Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg [1988]). Non-entrepreneurs, however, may be less likely to characterize
situations in optimistic terms and, thus, make decisions reflecting this negative perspective (Palich and Bagby
[1995]).
Opportunity recognition occurs in the early stages of the business life cycle prior to venture launch but may
also occur throughout the life of the enterprise and the life of the entrepreneur (Hills and Shrader [1998]).
Opportunity recognition involves perceiving a possibility to create a new business venture or significantly
improving the position of an existing business which, in both cases, results in new profit potential
(Christensen, Madsen, and Peterson [1989]).
Entrepreneurs identify opportunities by using different types of information about the environment where it is
available (Busenitz [1996]). They make a habit of scanning their environments for information that may lead
to new business opportunities (Kaish and Gilad [1991]). Focusing on markets and customers increases the
probability of recognizing entrepreneurial opportunities (Bhave [1994]; Hills and Shrader [1998]).
Sometimes the decision to start a venture precedes recognizing an opportunity and there is a concerted search
for and filtration of viable business opportunities. At other times, entrepreneurs discover problems to be
solved or market needs to fulfill and, only then, do they decide to start a business and become entrepreneurs
(Bhave [1994]).
Entrepreneurs often act on an idea with limited information; (Hebert and Link [1988]; Gartner, Bird, and
Starr [1992]; Busenitz [1996]). They often have to make decisions where there are no historical trends, no
previous levels of performance, and little, if any, specific market information (Miller and Frierson [1984]).
Entrepreneurs, especially in the formative stages of their organizations, do not have the luxury of becoming
expert decision makers in a specific area (Gilmore and Kazanjian [1989]). If entrepreneurs wait until all the
"facts" are in to start convincing others that their venture is indeed legitimate, the opportunity they are
seeking to exploit will most likely be gone by the time all the data become available (Stevenson and Gumpert
[1985]). For this reason, Busenitz and Barney [1997] suggest that those who make greater use of biases and
heuristics (rules of thumb based on experience) in their decision making are more likely to find themselves in
an entrepreneurial context.
FINANCIERS AND OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION
It is not only entrepreneurs who operate in an entrepreneurial context. Private equity financiers of
entrepreneurial ventures do as well; yet, less is known about how they recognize opportunities. Part of this
has to do with the different types of financiers that are involved at the various stages of the entrepreneurial
process. Bankers providing debt finance, for example, generally only fund business ventures to the extent that
there are hard assets against which to secure the debt as well as cash flow to repay the debt. As such,
particularly in the earlier stages of venture growth, entrepreneurs often need to turn to private equity
financiers of entrepreneurial ventures such as business angels or venture capitalists for alternative sources of
funding.
From one perspective, different types of financiers have similar objectives in that they want to structure their
financing instruments so as to find the right balance of sharing cash and risk (Petty and Upton [1996]). They
also seem to use similar criteria or cue sets when it comes to identifying potential business opportunities.
Items such as the market, the team, and, to a lesser extent, technology seem to provide dimensions along
which financiers recognize opportunities. Corporate financial backers of corporate entrepreneurs
(intrapreneurs), for example, seem to support projects that are not only in strategic alignment with the
corporation, but also that are in an attractive market and that have a corporate entrepreneurial team with a
good understanding of the marketplace (Koen [1998]). Venture capitalist studies report that funding a
potential opportunity is dependent primarily on the quality of the entrepreneurial team (Macmillan, Siegel,

<-----Page 2----->and Subba Narasimha [1985]; Goslin and Barge [1986]; Robinson [1987]) or the attractiveness of the market
(Rah, Jung, and Lee [1994]; Bahn, Zacharakis, and Song [2002]). Because business angels are not
accountable to others for their investment decisions, they invest more on "gut feel" rather than based on
comprehensive research. Business angels frequently are required to make investment decisions under
conditions of uncertainty with information that is complex and incomplete (van Osnabrugge [1999]). As
such, they are more likely to employ heuristic decision-making techniques. (Farrell and Howorth [2002]).
Interviews of business angels suggest that they may be more influenced by the entrepreneurial team during
the screening process (van Osnabrugge [1999]) though they prefer to invest in markets and/or technologies
that are familiar to them or in which they have had some direct experience (Kelly and Hay [1996]).
Although similar criteria or cues seem to be used by financiers of entrepreneurial ventures in recognizing
opportunities, the various populations of financiers differ substantially. Differences occur in their risk
preferences, backgrounds, experiences, prejudices, and objectives (see, for example, Roberts [1991];
Harrison and Mason [2002]). These types of items will vary the financing decision and help to explain why
some financiers may think that a particular project is an opportunity while others may disagree.
OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION AS PART OF THE OPPORTUNITY FORMULATION PROCESS

The process of formulating an opportunity is discussed in terms of opportunity search, opportunity
recognition, and opportunity evaluation (see, for example, Hills [1995]; Hills, Lumpkin, and Singh [1997];
Hills and Shrader [1998]). Building upon their findings, we suggest that the opportunity recognition is
comprised of two parts. During the opportunity recognition phase, potential opportunities first are identified
at a broad and general level and compared against a "normative template" of opportunity characteristics or
cues before being evaluated against specific individualized fit criteria. The opportunity recognition phase is
preceded by the opportunity search phase and is followed by the opportunity evaluation or verification phase
where the opportunity is verified through "due diligence." Exhibit 1 provides an overview of the entire
opportunity formulation process (opportunity search, opportunity recognition, and opportunity evaluation).
Exhibit 2 provides an explanation of individual phases within the overall process.
In relation to the opportunity recognition phase, entrepreneurs and financiers place importance upon a range
of cues when recognizing business opportunities. These appear to include (and are not limited to) the
entrepreneurial team, the market, and/or the technology (see, for example, Timmons [1999]). In sorting
through the range of cues in the opportunity recognition process, creative thinking (involving
cross-associations of chunks of experience, know-how, and contacts) is used to synthesize the various cues

<-----Page 3----->and recognize patterns in the business complexity (see, for example, Simon [1985]). Simon [1985] describes
pattern recognition as a creative process that is not simply logical, linear, and additive; it is often intuitive and
deductive. He argues that it takes 10 years or more for people to develop appropriate levels of experience to
allow them to recognize patterns in new situations based on previous experience.
Put simply, individuals develop cognitively based frameworks for generating explanations of their situations
(Gooding and Kinicki [1995]). The more times that an experienced entrepreneur or private equity financier is
exposed to the opportunity recognition process, the more chunks of experience and more heuristics that will
be developed by them and added to their long-term memory. It is here where the experience and heuristics
cumulate and are stored in the form of an "opportunity pattern recognition template." This template contains
opportunity dimensions or cues and cue weightings (ready to be transferred into short-term memory if
needed) against which potential opportunities can be compared. Entrepreneurial action in using the template
to seek "opportunity hits" and ensuring against "missed opportunities," however, will more likely occur for
individuals in a promotion-focused state of eagerness. It will depend on their entrepreneurial aptitude and
attitude (McMullen and Shepherd [2002]).
Since experience in an entrepreneurial context--as a habitual entrepreneur or an experienced private equity
financier--is a prerequisite for developing opportunity recognition pattern templates, it is expected that, at a
"normative" opportunity recognition level, the templates developed by habitual entrepreneurs will be similar
to those developed by experienced private equity financiers of entrepreneurial ventures. (Differences are
expected between and among groups at the "individualized fit" opportunity recognition level since some
given opportunities will not fit the risk profiles, investment preferences, etc., of some individuals.) As such, it
is expected that, at the normative opportunity recognition level, this will result in similarities across some of
the dimensions identified by Hills [1995] for both experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers in
terms of the variety and quantity of selected opportunity recognition perceptions and behaviors adopted by
these individuals.
HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT
Based on the above, Hills' [1995] framework was used to develop a number of hypotheses. There are six
dimensions associated with this framework. Hills' [1995] dimensions focus on creativity and idea generation,
perceived entrepreneurial alertness to opportunities, sources of information for identifying opportunities,
deliberate search processes for recognition opportunities, causes of opportunities, and intuitive judgment or
"gut feel" to evaluate opportunities. Hypotheses were developed around these six dimensions.
It is expected that greater experience in developing and investing in entrepreneurial ventures will lead to
greater individual confidence by experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers. As a result, there
will be a belief among these individuals that they will have a greater entrepreneurial alertness in recognizing
business opportunities.
Hypothesis 1: There will be no difference between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers of
entrepreneurial ventures in terms of their beliefs that they are capable of recognizing business opportunities
(perceived entrepreneurial alertness to opportunities).
Perceived entrepreneurial alertness will influence the number of ideas generated by experienced
entrepreneurs and private equity financiers as well as how they creatively put different cues together in
looking for opportunities.
Hypothesis 2: There will be no difference between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers of
entrepreneurial ventures in terms of their levels of creativity and number of ideas generated (creativity and
idea generation).
In addition, experience with previously successful and unsuccessful opportunities will influence the search

<-----Page 4----->processes and strategies used by experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers in looking for
potential opportunities.
Hypothesis 3: There will be no difference between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers of
entrepreneurial ventures in terms of the processes and search strategies used to source opportunities (search
processes and strategies).
Experienced entrepreneurs and private equity providers will have an understanding of the underlying causes
of opportunities. They will appreciate that these are often found where there are problems and business
solutions available to solve those problems, changes in the market, and readily identifiable customers.
Hypothesis 4: There will be no difference between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers in
terms of their understanding of the underlying causes of opportunities (causes of opportunities).
Although it is expected that there will be similarities between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity
providers in terms of some of Hills' [1995] dimensions, differences are expected in terms of the sources
identified as to where future potential opportunities may be found (opportunity sources). Entrepreneurs will
have their own individualized sources; private equity financiers will have theirs.
Hypothesis 5: There will be differences between experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers of
entrepreneurial ventures in terms of where they search for business opportunities in the opportunity
recognition process (opportunity sources).
Among experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers, on the one hand, there is an expectation that
there will be no difference in the opportunity recognition process. Opportunities at a broad and general level
are opportunities from any experienced person's perspective involved in an entrepreneurial context and are
characterized by certain characteristics or cues (see, for example, Timmons [1999, pp. 86-95]). As such,
experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers will have similar comprehensive internal opportunity
recognition templates comprised of a relatively common set of "normative" cues and a "normative" weighting
set for individual cues to help them identify opportunities.
Hypothesis 6: There will be no difference between entrepreneurs and private equity financiers in terms of the
underlying cues used and cue weightings used to identify opportunities at a broad and general level
(evaluation and "gut feel").
On the other hand, however, there are other individualized situational factors that may influence the
opportunity recognition outcome. These factors focus on "fit" between the opportunity and the individual
entrepreneur or financier. Fit relates to the specific circumstances of individuals. Fit will be determined by
items such as risk propensity (which may preclude particular venture life-cycle stages), prejudices against, or
preferences for, particular business opportunities (that may be associated with particular industries,
technologies, etc.), the individual backgrounds and skills of entrepreneurs and financiers, and individual
objectives (for example, lifestyle considerations may feature in the decision to proceed). These items will
moderate the opportunity recognition process. Thus, at a broad and general level, there may be universal
agreement among experienced entrepreneurs and financiers on whether a particular scenario is an
opportunity. At the individual level, however, the fit of an opportunity as measured against personal and
business-related circumstances, may cause diverging decisions as to whether the scenario is a potential
opportunity for an individual. In other words, given that experienced entrepreneurs and financiers may agree
that a particular scenario is a potential opportunity (that is, it is a potential opportunity at a broad and general
level ... for "someone"), that given opportunity may not be an opportunity for specific individuals due to an
inappropriate individualized fit for them. What may be an opportunity for one person, may not be an
opportunity for another.
Hypothesis 7: There will be differences between entrepreneurs and private equity financiers in terms of

<-----Page 5----->whether the opportunity fits situational (personalized and business-related) criteria (individualized fit).
Unfortunately, Hypothesis 7 is beyond the scope of this study and the research method used. Hypothesis 7
will therefore be examined in future research using a multi-method approach. It is included here to provide a
holistic perspective of the opportunity recognition process.
METHOD
Participants
Participants had at least nine years' current experience in an entrepreneurial context (they either operated their
own high-growth businesses and had developed more than one business opportunity or they were
experienced in providing private equity finance to entrepreneurial ventures). All had successful high-growth
businesses (business turnover was in excess of $18 million and business growth rates were at least 20% per
year) or operated successful business units within their investment organization.
The sample comprised 262 respondents. This data set was collected from entrepreneurs (n = 157) and private
equity financiers (n = 105). There were 113 respondents (43%) that had between 10 and 21 years' experience.
The private equity financier group was comprised of venture capitalists (n = 53), business angels (n = 13),
and members of private equity funding divisions within banks (n = 39).
Instrument
The questionnaire used in the study was modified from a questionnaire originally developed by Hills [1995]
which he adapted from Teach, Schwartz, and Tarpley [1989] and Christensen and Peterson [1990]. Hills'
[1995] questionnaire is a 76-item measure. There were 51 questions taken from this questionnaire. The 25
questions rejected related to "owning your own business." The assumption was made that many of the private
equity financiers may not own their own businesses and therefore would not be able to answer the rejected
questions correctly. Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale except for those identifying major new
business ideas (these were scored on a 3-point scale). The question categories matched the six dimensions of
Hills' [1995] framework. These appear in Exhibit 3. In addition to questions relating to these six dimensions,
a demographic information page was included that asked respondents details on their age, gender, academic
qualifications, experience, industry, size of organization, and number of employees.
Analysis
The analysis focused on the differences in responses between the entrepreneur and private equity financier
groups. Independent group t-tests were used to establish differences between the two groups in the categories
of creativity and idea generation, perceived entrepreneurial alertness, search process and strategies, causes of
opportunities, sources, and evaluation and gut feel.
Procedures
A research team was formed to collect the data from experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers.
A list was collated from organizations and individuals known to the group, financiers listed in a venture
capital directory, and high-growth businesses listed in government-collated databases. Participants were
contacted by phone to seek their willingness to be involved in the research and a preferred data collection
method (for example, mail, fax, email, or personal visit) was negotiated. The direct approach by the research
team to the targeted individuals facilitated a high response rate with few reports of unwillingness to complete
the questionnaire.
Results and Discussion

<-----Page 6----->There were few significant differences between the entrepreneur and private equity financier groups. Overall,
this lends support to the notion that experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers develop a general
level of understanding that allows them to recognize business opportunities at a broad and general level.
There were minor differences between the two groups, however, for the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1
(alertness to opportunities), Hypothesis 2 (creativity and idea generation), Hypothesis 3 (search processes and
strategies), Hypothesis 5 (opportunity sources), and Hypothesis 6 (evaluation and "gut feel"). These
differences related to a specific question within various categories of questions on the questionnaire rather
than broad differences across the majority of questions in each category. Details are as follows:
Hypothesis 1--Alertness to Opportunities: Overall, there were no differences on the measures of alertness;
however, entrepreneurs were significantly different on one question, believing that they had a special
sensitivity or alertness toward opportunities (t = 1.963; p < 0.05). Entrepreneurs tend to be very positive
people and tend to have strong beliefs in their capabilities. This result can be interpreted as demonstrating the
strength of entrepreneur beliefs in their "gut feel" in identifying opportunities. The reality, however, often is
different as financiers well know. Many businesses do not succeed. Private equity financiers may be more
cautious in their beliefs that they are alert to recognizing opportunities perhaps because of previous funding
decisions that have "gone bad."
Hypothesis 2--Creativity and Idea Generation: Overall, there were no differences on the measures of
creativity and idea generation. Entrepreneurs, however, differed on the importance of business ideas in the
creative process (t = 2.241; p < 0.05). Compared to financiers, entrepreneurs thought that ideas were more
important. Financiers deal in potential opportunities that are presented to them by entrepreneurs whereas
entrepreneurs need to sift through and generate many ideas before identifying an opportunity that they can
present for funding consideration. As such, it is a matter of degree. What begins as an idea for an
entrepreneur becomes a business proposition for a financier. Though financiers need to use both right and left
brain skills in evaluating business proposals, their quantitative leanings may explain their preference for
evaluation rather than idea generation.
Hypothesis 3--Search Processes and Strategies: Overall, there were no differences on the measure of search
processes and strategies. Entrepreneurs, however, believed more strongly than financiers that one idea leads
to another (t = 4.054; p < 0.001). This is not surprising. Financiers receive discrete business propositions
from various sources for funding consideration. Presumably, one proposition would have no relation to the
next. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are at a lower level in trying to identify opportunities and may use
ideas generated or insights gleaned from one situation as a "springboard" to the next. In addition, it supports
the notion that entrepreneurs are more open to ideas than financiers.
Hypothesis 4--Causes of Opportunities: There were no differences between entrepreneurs and financiers on
the measures of the underlying causes of opportunities. Both groups appear to be attuned to the fact that there
are opportunities associated with problems and market related changes.
Hypothesis 5--Opportunity Sources: Financiers were more likely to rely on trade publications as sources for
ideas whereas entrepreneurs tended to obtain information about opportunities from professional
acquaintances (t = 1.817; p < 0.001). At first, this finding perplexed us as we expected that financiers would
rely heavily on their network of contacts to refer deals to them. On reflection, however, this result provides
insight into how financiers monitor trends for future business opportunities. They obtain their ideas from
publications to gauge consumer and industry trends and then most probably source deals in those areas. On
the other hand, entrepreneurs typically are excellent networkers. They know that they need other people to
help them achieve their goals. Professional advisers are exposed to a range of clients with differing
businesses and products/services. Entrepreneurs apparently recognize this and use professionals as a trusted
idea source.
Hypothesis 6--Evaluation and "Gut Feel": Overall, there were no differences on the measures of evaluation

<-----Page 7----->and "gut feel." Financiers, however, felt significantly more strongly than entrepreneurs (t = 4.856; p < 0.05)
that formal market research is important when evaluating ideas. This reflects, perhaps, a greater tendency
toward thoroughness of financiers and the fact that they are used to under-taking "due diligence" on the
claims of entrepreneurs via independent, third-party sources. Entrepreneurs, however, have to make decisions
and work with only partial market and other information to develop their opportunities.
Overall, therefore, there were few differences between the two groups. Experienced (habitual) entrepreneurs
and experienced private equity providers appear to recognize opportunities at a broad and general level in a
similar manner. At this higher level, due to the environmental context in which they derive their experience,
it seems they use similar normative cues.
Research Limitations
This research has a number of limitations. First, the samples for the two groups were not randomly selected.
This affects generalizability of the results. Second, there is no evidence of construct, criterion related, and
discriminant validities of the questionnaire. In addition, internal consistency ranges and test/retest reliabilities
were not established.
RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION
Despite its limitations, this research makes a contribution at two levels. At the theoretical level, it extends our
understanding of the opportunity recognition process and contributes toward the development of a theory of
opportunity recognition--not just for entrepreneurs but also for private equity financiers of entrepreneurial
ventures.
Specifically, the research makes a contribution to the literature by proposing that the opportunity recognition
process is divided into two phases: 1) the "normative" opportunity recognition phase and 2) the
"individualized fit" opportunity recognition phase (see, for example, Craig and Lindsay [2001]). It also
supports the notion that, providing that there is relevant information available to all decision makers
(information symmetries), experienced or habitual entrepreneurs and experienced private equity financiers
have the capability of recognizing, universally, when a given opportunity exists at a broad and general level.
The opportunity, however, may not be an opportunity for them specifically though they will be able to
recognize it as a given opportunity ... at least as an opportunity for someone. In other words, a given
opportunity may be an opportunity for someone else where the "individualized fit" with the opportunity is
more appropriate to that other person/ entity. (Business angels and venture capitalists, for example, differ in
the importance they attach to market risk and agency risk in evaluating opportunities (Harrison and Mason
[2002]). Although both groups may perceive a given opportunity at a broad level, that same opportunity may
be preferred by one party over the other due to risk preferences.)
Where there are information asymmetries among experienced decision makers (relevant information is not
distributed equally to all decision makers), however, there still may be individual differences in recognizing a
given opportunity at a broad and general level among experienced entrepreneurs and private equity financiers
(see, for example, Shane [2000]). Some decision makers may know about particular customer problems,
market characteristics, or the ways to create particular products or services whereas other decision makers
may not (Venkataraman [1997]). This may help to explain why private equity financiers such as venture
capitalists may only achieve exceptional investment success in about 1 out of every 10 ventures that they
fund (Birmingham, Busenitz, and Arthurs [2002]).
At the applied level, the research provides a basis for developing training programs that will assist novice
entrepreneurs and novice private equity financiers to be better able to recognize business opportunities. It
also provides a basis for developing a multi-dimensional "deal screening instrument" that will assist private

<-----Page 8----->equity financiers to screen and document the quality assurance aspects of the deal screening process.
Decision support systems that help to screen deals hold the promise of relieving professional investors from
this time-consuming but vital activity (Schultz, Murray, and Degraeve [2002]).
A major concern of any investor always is Type I investment error: placing money in an investee when the
deal should have been rejected. In this situation, the investment really is not an opportunity and the financier
loses money (or makes returns less than what is considered desirable). An additional concern (though usually
seen as a lesser consequence, yet having important ramifications for a financier) is Type II investment error.
This occurs when the financier rejects a deal because it is perceived not to be an opportunity--either at the
normative level or the individualized fit level. The deal, however, results in generating exceptional returns for
others who invested in that opportunity (but not for the financier that rejected it).
A deal screening instrument will provide documented evidence for the consumption of third parties as to why
deals in the pipeline were accepted or rejected. Providing documentary evidence on deal acceptance/
rejection is important when management needs to justify investment decisions, to examine the quality of deal
flow, and/or to review its performance.
SUMMARY
This study builds upon previous research by Hills [1995] and others into opportunity recognition. Early
indications support the proposition that, at a broad and general level, opportunities are seen in a similar
manner by those who have developed experience in an entrepreneurial context whether they are experienced
(habitual) entrepreneurs or experienced private equity financiers. This is supported by the similarity in the
opportunity recognition behaviors, opportunity perceptions, opportunity causes, etc., across Hills' [1995]
dimensions that were used in this research.
EXHIBIT 2 Explanation of the Opportunity Formulation Phases
1. Opportunity Search: Scanning for and Encountering Possible Opportunities
The opportunity search process involves scanning the environment for possible opportunities while looking
for and/or generating possible ideas. If a potential opportunity is encountered, the opportunity search process
ceases and the opportunity recognition process begins.
2. Opportunity Recognition: Nonnative and Individualized Fit Phases
This process involves two phases. The first phase involves reviewing a situation to identify whether it is a
potential opportunity in broad and general terms. The second phase involves determining whether the
opportunity specifically is an opportunity for the particular entrepreneur or financier.
2.1 Normative Opportunity Recognition Phase:
"Is this an opportunity?"

<-----Page 9----->This is the first phase of the opportunity recognition process. During this phase, a normative opportunity
pattern recognition template is used to screen the potential opportunity. This template contains "normative"
cues (such as those that relate to the market, team, product/technology, etc.) and "normative" weightings for
those cues in terms of an "ideal" potential opportunity. In this regard, ideal "patterns" exist for the cues
collectively at higher levels and their constituent lower-level subparts.
At this level, we suggest that anyone who has significant experience in the entrepreneurial domain will have
developed a fundamental opportunity pattern template. This template will contain similar cues and
"guidance" as to how to evaluate potential opportunity scenarios in terms of those cues.
Regardless of whether the person is an experienced entrepreneur or financier, their opportunity recognition
templates will be similar due to the experience they have developed in the entrepreneurial domain. As such,
they will be able to recognize whether there is a potential opportunity in a given situation ... at least, for
someone (though not necessarily for them). Thus, we would expect that there would be no differences among
people who are experienced in working in an entrepreneurial context in recognizing an existing opportunity
at a broad and general level and that, in fact, there would be universal agreement among them on this issue.
We would expect differences among these experienced decision makers, however, with the second phase of
the opportunity recognition process: the individualized fit opportunity recognition phase.
2.2 Individualized Fit Opportunity Recognition Phase:
"Is this an opportunity for me/us?"
This is the second phase of the opportunity recognition process. During this phase, the previously identified
potential opportunity is evaluated in terms of how well it "fits" the entrepreneur's or financier's personal
and/or business-related criteria. In this regard, an individualized fit opportunity recognition template is used
to screen the opportunity.
We speculate that, during this phase, the "fit" of the identified opportunity is determined in terms of
individualized items such as: prejudices; preferences; objectives (for example, lifestyle); skills, know-how,
and experience levels; risk preferences; and timing implications. As such, there will be divergence among the
various groups of decision makers (and within groups of decision makers) as to whether an identified given
potential opportunity is an opportunity specifically for them.
3. Opportunity Evaluation or Verification: Due Diligence and Funds Commitment
Where there appears to be a "good" fit, the decision will be made to proceed to the opportunity evaluation or

<-----Page 10----->verification phase. This will involve collecting information on the potential opportunity to verify the "claims"
made in relation to the potential opportunity situation. This is sometimes referred to as "due diligence." It
involves attempting to quantify the intuition or gut feeling. The opportunity verification phase also will
involve a decision as to whether the entrepreneur or financier will commit funds if there is a positive due
diligence outcome. For example, an entrepreneur or financier may decide not to commit funding to an
opportunity even though the due diligence outcome was positive because they may obtain a better return on a
competing opportunity for a given risk level.
