Abstract:
Consideration
of the nature
of expertise
is
inherent
in expert systems development efforts.
A number of
assumptions
regarding
expertise
are often made which can be
problematic,
particularly
in management domains.
This paper
identifies
a pre-knowledge
acquisition
activity
that can be
performed
in order
to address
these
assumptions.
This
activity
is centered around the psychological
concept of tacit
knowledge.
The paper outlines
how the tacit
knowledge
methodology
is being used to define and delineate
expertise
in the domain of entrepreneurship.

<-----Page 2----->ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING EXPERTISE
Three assumptions regarding the nature of expertise
often
made in developing
expert systems are discussed below.
These
assumptions
are not made in all development efforts,
nor are
they always dysfunctional.
However, they are worthy
of
explicit
consideration
since they are sufficiently
prevalent
and can be called
into question.

by Stabell
(1982) in the context of decision

It may be
the case that expertise

or to operate in the absence of these items.
Another aspect
of this

For example, one
method of evaluating
an expert

TACIT KNOWLEDGE
The nature of tacit

(1966) who described
it as knowledge which is experientially

difficult
to do so
(Gruber,
1989; Klein
and Hirschheim,
1985; Slatter
1987).
However, it is possible
to use the concept of tacit
knowledge
to address the nature of domain-specific
expertise
in a way
that avoids the assumptions discussed above.

with Polanyi
(1966),
they define
tacit

as a) practical

b) informal
rather
than

and c) experientially-acquired

Tacit knowledge has been found to be predictive
of
success in a variety
of domains, including

(Wagner and Sternberg,

The focus in tacit

is on identifying
the knowledge that distinguishes

and further,
on showing
that

In
order
to
investigate
tacit

a domain, it is necessary
to define a tacit
knowledge instrument
for that domain.
The
instrument
consists
of a series of work related
situations
(called
scenarios).
Each scenario
has a number of possible
actions
(response items) associated
with it.
Individuals
of
varying
experience
levels in the domain are asked to examine
the scenarios
and to rate the relative
importance
of each
response item.
Using statistical
discrimination
procedures,
the response items that differentiate
between individuals
of
different
experience
levels are identified
as the items of the
tacit
knowledge scale.
The next step is to examine whether
tacit
knowledge is associated
with success within
experience
levels.

The effects
of experience
are partialled

and these

measures

Thus, the tacit
knowledge concept and methodology
allows
us to explore
the nature of expertise
in a domain without
making the assumptions discussed above. There is an explicit

of individual

scenarios
constitute
a body of material
that can be analyzed
in more
detail.
Since it is known where and how experts and novices
respond differently
to each scenario,
it would be worthwhile
to focus
on the rationales
behind
these
responses
when
eliciting
more detailed
procedural
expertise.
Finally,
the
lack of a shared vocabulary
that was found among experienced
entrepreneurs
suggests that detailed
knowledge elicitation
in
this
domain
should
be focused
at the
conceptual
and
epistemological
levels of representation
and interpretation,
rather
than at the linguistic
level,
as defined
by Brachman
(1979) . Knowledge elicitation
techniques
aimed at delineating
a shared vocabulary
are unlikely
to be effective.
