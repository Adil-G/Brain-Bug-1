Developments in the supply of equity capital during the 1980s have reduced the size of the equity
gap in the UK. However, such developments have not adequately met the need for smaller
amounts of venture capital, especially for firms seeking to raise seed and start-up capital.
Moreover, recent initiatives to develop seed capital funds and regionally based venture capital
funds appear unlikely to significantly close the equity gap. In this paper we argue that informal
venture capital - that is, venture capital provided by private individuals directly to new and
growing businesses with which they have had no prior connection - provides a promising
solution to closing the equity gap. However, its potential is limitcd by inefficiencies in the
operation of the informal venture capital market. We therefore propose a number of policy
initiatives to overcome these inefficiencies.

Introduction

In a recent paper (Harrison and Mason 1991) we argued that the finance gap in the U K ,
and particularly the gap in the provision of equity finance to new and small businesses,
continued to exist despite the rapid expansion over the past decade in the formal venture
capital and secondary stock markets. This equity gap reflects the existence of both
supply- and demand-side factors: on the demand side, entrepreneurs are reluctant to
surrender equity because of the perceived loss of ownership and control, and the cost
involved; on the supply side, investors are reluctant to take equity positions in unquoted
businesses because of the problems of information asymmetry, portfolio management
and the high relative evaluation and monitoring costs that these generally small
investments entail. In our view, informal investments (i.e., the provision of risk finance
by private individuals directly to unquoted businesses) can play a significant role in filling
the equity gap because entrepreneurs can raise smaller amounts of finance at lower cost
for longer periods and on rather more permissive investment criteria, compared with the
formal venture capital market. Based on a case study of one informal investment
syndicate we have argued that the informal investment market in the U K may operate
less efficiently than in the USA, and may therefore make a smaller contribution to closing
the equity gap (Harrison and Mason 1991).
In this paper we extend the argument by, first, providing a more detailed review of
recent developments in institutional sources of equity finance in the U K , and the
implications of these developn~entsfor the nature and extent of the equity gap; second,
reviewing recent approaches to closing the equity gap through the development of seed
capital funds and regionally based venture capital funds; third, summarizing some of the
major findings from our survey of informal investors in the UK; and, finally, developing
a number of policy recommendations to stimulate the informal venture capital market in
the U K .

The supply of equity finance in the UK

Despite recent changes, the difficulty that small firms encounter in raising capital for
start-up and growth, first noted some 60 years ago by the Macmillan Report ( H M
Government 1931) and periodically confirmed in subsequent government enquiries and
other studies ( H M Government 1959, 1971, 1979, ACOST 1990, Mason and Harrison
1991a) continues to persist. However, the nature of the small firm finance gap has
changed in various respects over the years as a result of the emergence of new financial
institutions, changes in attitudes towards small firms and policy initiatives to assist the
small firm sector.
Two such changes are of particular note. First, this finance gap is now largely confined
to a lack of equity finance. In recent years all of the major clearing banks have introduced
new financial packages and assistance tailored to the needs of small firms and are
competing strongly for small business customers (Binks and Ennew 1991). In addition,
the Loan Guarantee Scheme has played a small but significant role in assisting small
firms, many of which would not otherwise receive debt finance on commercial terms,
primarily for lack of adequate assets to use as security, to raise finance (National
Economic Research Associates 1990). Second, developments in the supply of equity
capital during the 1980s, notably the emergence of a venture capital industry, have
reduced the size of the equity gap. Prior to the 1980s the only sources of venture capital
were the small business arms of the clearing banks, merchant banks which specialized in
small business clients and ICFC (now 3i) (Clark 1987). The Bolton Report suggested in
1971 that an equity gap existed for amounts of under £250,000 ( H M Government 1971),
which at current prices is about f1 million. However, the development of the venture
capital industry has helped to reduce the size of this gap. Thus, at the present time, the
equity gap is largely confined to firms seeking to raise amounts of under £ 100,000
(although some commentators put this figure at £250,000) and is largely encountered by
new and recently started businesses. The equity gap is therefore primarily a shortage of
seed, start-up and early stagejnance. Indeed, as one recent account of the development of the
U K venture capital industry pointed out (Murray 1991a), the start-uplearly stage
investee companies were the one client group of venture capitalists whose power had not
increased during the 1980s (compared with, for example, management buyouts). As a
result, venture capitalists had not reduced their target annualized internal rate of return
from the level of 60-80%, retaining this premium to compensate for the increased risks
of investing in such ventures during a recession when the risks of failure or lack of growth
are higher.
This equity gap is a function of both demand- and supply-side factors. Most small firm
owners adopt a 'patrimonial' attitude, based on a misunderstanding of the role of equity
finance which equates the sale of equity to outside investors with a loss of managerial
control and independence. For such businesses, external equity investment is regarded as
financing of the last resort even where i t is the most appropriate form of financing.
Moreover, should such businesses seek equity their search is likely to be frustrated by the
owner's unrealistic expectation of the proportion of the company's equity demanded by
investors in exchange for the capital. The minority of small business owners who
approach financing from an 'entrepreneurial' viewpoint are more willing to consider
equity financing, recognizing that defacto managerial control is more important than
financial control or legal ownership (Vickery 1989). However, because of supply
constraints these small business owners are likely to find difficulty in raising risk capital.
The co-existence of this 'equity gap' alongside a venture capital industry which is the

largest and most mature in Europe and second only to the USA in relative terms, and the
Business Expansion Scheme (BES), which provides tax incentives to individuals who put
equity capital into qualifying small companies, may appear to be a paradox. However,
aggregate statistics on the amount of risk capital available for investment present a very
misleading picture of the extent to which this finance has been made available to all types
of businesses. As the discussion below makes clear, both venture capital and BES
investments have been particularly reluctant to invest in start-ups and technology-based
companies and their fund raising and investment patterns are contributing to uneven
regional development.

2.1

Venture capital and the equity gap

During the 1980s there was an enormous expansion in the number of venture capital
funds operating in the U K (Murray 1991b). Prior to 1979 there were just over 20 venture
capital funds with a total investment of £20 million. By 1990 the British Venture Capital
Association had 122 full members who had invested £1.1 billion in the U K in that year,
although as Cary (1991) notes, some of this expansion is simply the 'rechristening' by
many financial institutions of their traditional financing of unquoted companies as
'venture capital' because this sounds better. These new funds are of two main types.
First, many have been established by financial institutions, notably pension funds,
insurance companies, merchant banks and clearing banks. These venture capital funds,
in the jargon of the industry, are termed 'captives': that is, they form part of larger
financial institutions through which they are also primarily funded, although they have
considerable operational autonomy from their larger affiliates. Second, various
independent venture capital funds have been formed. They include U K subsidiaries of
large U S venture capital firms and independent firms formed by venture capital
managers who have 'spun-off from established venture capital firms such as 3i.
Independent venture capital organizations raise capital for investment from a variety of
sources, including pension funds, insurance companies and foreign institutions.
Independent funds increased in significance during the 1980s and are now the largest
category of venture capital organization, accounting for 37 % of the number of venture
capital investments and 44% of the total amount invested in the U K in 1990.
In the six years to 1990 approximately £6.2 bn had been invested by UK venture
capitalists, 86% in the U K , 8 % in the USA and 6 % elsewhere. Over this period, there
was a progressive fall in the U K share of investments and, in particular, investee
companies. This is largely accounted for by a shift in investment to Continental Europe
which accounted for 16% of venture capital investment by value by U K institutions in
1990 compared with 3% in 1988 (British Venture Capital Association 1989a, 1990).
However, this rapid growth in venture capital activity during the 1980s (Table 1) has
failed to fill the equity gap. The vast majority of venture capital funds specialize in
providing development capital. According to the V C R Guide to Vmture Capital in the UK
(Cary 1991), only about five venture capital firms provide seed capital, about 20 provide
start-up capital and about 50 provide early stage capital. By contrast, most funds provide
later stage development capital and virtually all investment institutions provide funds for
management buy-outs and buy-ins (Table 2). Not surprisingly, therefore, the venture
capital industry is dominated by large investments. The average venture capital
investment per round of financing increased from less than £400,000 in 1984 to £1.05 m
in 1989, although this subsequently fell to £840,000 in 1990 (Table 1). Deals of over £2 m

' T h e number of financings recorded differs from the number of companies because a small nurnber of
companies have raised more than one round of venture capital finance within the year.

accounted for two-thirds of the total arnount invested in 1988 compared with under onethird in 1985. By contrast, financings of under £200,000 fell from 10% of the total
invested in 1985 to just 5 % in 1988 (Pratt 1990). As a consequence, the modest success in
closing the equity gap in the early 1980s has now been reversed (Pratt 1990, Cary 1991).
The increasing size of investments reflects the growing dominance of management
buy-outs and buy-ins (MBOs and MBIs) in UK venture capital activity. MBOsIMBIs
have been very attractive to UK venture capitalists for a variety of reasons (Table 3).
They have a lower risk than other types of investments, notably start-ups and early stage
investments. MBOsIMBIs involve businesses that are established and profitable (or
potentially profitable), the products are developed, the market is known, long-established
links exist with customers and a management team, which is familiar with all aspects of
the business, is in place. For the same reasons, venture capitalists have to devote less time
and effort to research MBOsIMBIs prior to investment and to support them afterwards.
In addition, because MBOsIMBIs usually involve well-established businesses in mature
industries generating a comfortable and regular cash flow they have produced the highest
returns. Finally, MBOsIMBIs offer a quicker exit route than most other types of
investment.
MBOsIMBIs represented 18% of all venture capital investments in the UK in 1984:
this had risen to 25% by 1989. Over the same period the proportion of UK venture
capital investment absorbed by MBOsIMBIs rose from 28% to 61 %. Although both the
number and proportion of venture capital financings accounted for by MBOsIMBIs rose
slightly in 1990 a fall in the number of very large buy-outs has resulted in a decline in
their share of total venture capital invested to 52% (Table 4). The converse of this
concentration on MBOsIMBIs is that the venture capital industry has been reluctant to
finance companies requiring smaller amounts of capital, especially those at the start-up
and early stages of business development. This lack of support for start-up and early
stage businesses has been recognized by chief executives of major venture capital funds as
the greatest failure of the industry to date (Murray 1991b). The proportion of total
venture capital investment accounted for by start-up and early stage finance was 27 % by
value and 34% by number of firiancings in 1984 (Pratt 1990). By 1990 these figures had
fallen to 12% by value and 26% by number (Table 4). Seedcorn investments account for
an even smaller amount of venture capital activity. Venture capitalists invested just over
£4 m in seed capital investments in 1989, a significant increase on the £1. 1 m invested in
the previous year, but representing just 0.2% of funds raised (Merchant 1990).
Moreover, it seems unlikely that this situation will change over the next few years: recent
surveys of the investment preferences of venture capitalists report that management buyouts will continue to be the dominant form of investment over the next five years and that
the limited popularity of investing seed and start-up capital will persist (Murray 1991b).

companies ( M u r r a y a n d Lott 1992). Computer-related a n d electronics companies
accounted forjust 8% of the finance invested in 1990 (compared with 3 0 % in 1984), with

Sourcc: as for Table 1

Consumer-related activities increased their share of total venture capital financing from
23 % to 35 % between 1984 and 1990. A further 15% ofthe amount invested in 1990 went
into financial and other services.
A further concern is that, despite the emergence of some elements of a regional venture
capital industry in the U K which is more likely to make investments locally, in smaller
tranches and in a wider range of industrial sectors than London-based organizations,
there is still a significant north-south divide in the provision of venture capital in the U K
(Mason and Harrison 1991b). Throughout the 1987-90 period the South East region has
accounted for over half of the amount invested by the venture capital industry (Table 5).
When compared with its share of the total stock of U K businesses in this period (34.6%),
it is clear that venture capital investments have been disproportionately concentrated in
the South East. In all other regions, with the sole exception of Scotland, the proportion of
venture capital investments have been well below those expected on the basis of the
regional proportions of the stock of UK businesses.
This spatial pattern of venture capital activity in the U K has two significant
implications for regional economic development. First, promising small firms in
peripheral regions of the UK are likely to encounter a lack of risk capital which will
constrain their development and slow down the process of indigenously generated
regional economic development. Second, many of the South East-based venture capital
firms are likely to utilize nation-wide pension funds and other savings, a high proportion
of which are reinvested in the South East region. Thus, the venture capital industry is
contributing to a flow of investment finance from economically depressed regions in the
north and west to the prosperous south.

2.2 The Business Expansion Scheme and the equity gap
The Business Expansion Scheme (BES) was introduced in 1983 in an attempt to increase
the flow of equity finance into small businesses by allowing private individuals to claim
tax relief at their highest marginal rate of income tax on investments in unquoted
independent companies up to a maximum of £40,000 per year. The Government
Minister responsible for small firms policy at the time stated that its objectives were, first,
'to encourage new and expanded activity in the small firms sector', and, second, 'to
encourage investment in high-risk activities, where the risk to the investor will be at least
to some extent commensurate with the generous level of tax relief (Hansard, 10 May
1984, col. 1200).
O n the surface, the initiative appears to have been extremely successful. Over £750 rn
was invested in new equity in nearly 4000 small and medium-sized businesses through
the BES between 1983-84 and 1987-88, with the amount invested rising each year (Table
6 ) . Although this represents a significant addition to the pool of venture capital in the UK
it has done little to close the equity gap. Certainly, a high proportion of the businesses
which raised finance through the scheme have received small tranches of equity capital:
57% of companies raised less than £50,000 each. However, this accounted for only 5 %
of total investment. Conversely, 57% of the amount invested was accounted for by just
4 % of companies which each raised over £1 m under the scheme (Table 7). Moreover,
the proportion of total investment accounted for by such large investments has risen in
each year, from 30% in 1983-84 to 65% in 1987-88. This is reflected in the increase in
the average
- size of investments from £147,000 in 1983-84 to 2245,000 in 1987-88.
Nevertheless, this is well below the average size of venture capital investments. Thus,
while the BES has provided small tranches of equity finance to a large number of
businesses, only a small - and diminishing - proportion of total HES investment has been
directed to this purpose.

The 1988 Finance Act made two significant changes to the scheme. O n the positive
side, an upper limit of £500,000 on the amount that a company could raise under the
scheme in a single year (raised to £750,000 in 1990) was introduced in an attempt to
channel funds to companies seeking to raise relatively small amounts of finance.
However, the resulting reorientation of the scheme favoured investments in the £ 100,000
to £500,000 range. Although the proportion of finance invested in amounts of under
£100,000 more than doubled, such investments still accounted for less than one-quarter
of the investments by value (Table 7).

may be raised by any individual company in one year was limited to 55 million for shipping (and private
renting) companies and f500,000 for other trading companies. This lirr~itwas raised to f 750,000 in May
1990.

The second change was to extend thc scheme to include residential property for letting
under assured tenancy terms. As a result of this change the scheme has now largely
ceased to be a source of equity capital for the unquoted company sector, with 84% of the
£631 m raised under the BES in 1988-89 and 1989-90 for private-rented housing projects
(Table 6). This reflects two factors. First, its low-risk asset-backed nature makes it

particularly attractive to investors. Second, as a result of the introduction of an upper
limit on the amount that tmding companies can raise in any 12-month period through the
BES, it is no longer economic for trading companies to raise BES finance through
prospectus issues nor for financial intermediaries to sponsor such issues. BES sponsors
have therefore increasingly turned their attention to housing projects which have a
maximum investment limit of £5 m.
The BES has also failed to channel significant amounts of finance to technology-based
sectors. Even before its extension to include investments in private rented housing the
bulk of the finance raised through the scheme has been invested in service-sector
businesses, often asset-backed, predominantly in the wholesale, retail, real estate and
leisure sectors (Mason et al. 1988). BES investments have also been disproportionately
concentrated in the South East region which has consistently contained about half of all
investee companies. Total funds invested under the scheme are even more highly
concentrated in the South East region, which attracted 69% of the total amount invested
between 1984-85 and 1987-88. Moreover, the South East's share of BES investmcnts by
value has increased over time, from 37% in 1983-84 to 69% in 1987-88. The South East
and East Anglia are the only regions in which the proportion of BES investments exceeds
their share of the total stock of UK businesses. Every other region has been underrepresented in terms of its share of BES companies and amounts invested relative to their
proportion of the UK stock of businesses (Table 8). Furthermore, the scheme has
contributed to an outflow of finance from northern regions for reinvestment in the South

East (Mason et al. 1988, Mason and Harrison 1989). T h e South East's dominance has
continued following the inclusion of private rented housing in the scheme: between 1988
and 1990 it attracted 51% of investments in trading companies and 73% of the
investments in private rented housing, accounting for 60% and 72% respectively of the
amounts invested (Table 8).
The failure of the RES to contribute to the closing of the equity gap, its lack of
investments in technology-based sectors and the increasingly uneven geographical
distribution of investments under the scheme are all associated with a significant shift in
the way in which investments have been made under the scheme. BES investments can
be made in three ways. First, individuals can invest through specialist BES investmentfunds
which pool investors' money in order to invest in a portfolio of companies. Second,
prospectus issues raise investment under the BES directly from individuals through the
public issue, by a financial intermediary, of a prospectus inviting investors to apply for
shares in a particular company. Finally, in direct informal investments a company issues its
shares directly to the public, either by organizing its own issue with the assistance of a
solicitor or through a private placing of shares arranged by an approved financial
in tcrmediary .
There has been a very large increase in the value of BES investments accounted for by
prospectus issues which increased by over 250% between 1983-84 and 1987-88. By
1987-88 prospectus issues accounted for 73% of the amount raised under the BES
(compared with 37% in 1983-84) but only 10% of BES investee companies (Table 9).
The majority of prospectus issues have been large, with an average size of £ 1 . 1 m in
1983-84 and around £2 m in 1987-88, and concentrated in low-risk asset-backed and
property-related ventures such as wine traders, art dealers, racehorse breeders, hotels,
sheltered housing and residential nursing home developments, restaurants and retailing
(Mason et al. 1988). Prospectus issues are also overwhelmingly concentrated in the South
East region. Conversely, both the amount of finance raised and the number of companies
receiving finance from BES funds have declined. T h e proportion of finance accounted for
by direct investments has also fallen sharply, from 24% in 1983-84 to 18% in 1987-88
(Table 9). Thus, as the BES has developed, so direct investments - the mode of
investment most likely to contribute to the closing of the equity gap at the bottom end of
the size range, and which is least over-concentrated in the South East region - has
become increasingly marginalized and insignificant in terms of the proportion of finance
raised under the BES (Mason et al. 1988, Harrison and Mason 1989). With the
announcement that the BES is to be abolished once the five-year eligibility extension to

Recent developments in the supply of equity capital

Both the venture capital industry and the BES have largely failed to fill the equity gap. As
a result, the supply of smaller amounts of risk capital remains inadequate. The report of
the Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (ACOST) has provided
authoritative confirmation that 'there is a clear need. . . for the ready availability of
smaller amounts of risk capital' (ACOST 1990, p. 41) if the rate of business formation
and small firm growth
- a vital element in economic development - is to be increased.
A number of initiatives have been proposed for increasing the availability of risk
capital for new and recently started businesses. For example, it has been suggested that
the activities of Local Enterprise Boards should be expanded. However, recent
legislation, which has restricted local authority involvement in a wide range of economic
development activities, has severely circumscribed their role as a provider of venture
capital (Hayton 1989). The CBI has proposed the establishment of Local Investment
Companies (CBI 1983). Others have called for the creation of local markets in the shares
of small unlisted companies. Attempts to increase the amount of corporate venturing
(NEDC 1987) also appear to have had limited effect. ACOST (1990) notes that this
activity is still underdeveloped in the UK.
However, the most widely canvassed proposal has been the creation of venture capital
funds specializing in seed and start-up investments. The formal definition of seed capital
is 'equity which goes into a company before it is actually functioning as such. Its purpose
is to get the company from conception to newborn status, and as much further as possible
before outside financing and its accompanying ownership dilution occurs' (Gordon Baty,
quoted in Murray 1992). Such investments require a very active hands-on role. As a
result, they incur high costs and uncertain returns. The appraisal of small investment
proposals and the management of a portfolio of small investments requires almost as
much input of profession;d and other resources as those which are several times larger,
while the professional fees that can be commanded are lower and the risks are much
greater. Indeed, the need to make a larger number of investments in order to get a
reasonable spread of risk further contributes to the high appraisal and monitoring costs of
seed and start-up funds. The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) has estimated
that the real cost of running a seed fund is between £150,000 and £200,000 per annum,
depending on its location, which represents an unacceptably high proportion of the funds
under management (BVCA 1989b). It is therefore difficult for venture capital funds
specializing in seed and start-up investments to operate under conventional commercial
criteria. Indeed, the small number of seed funds in the U K either rely on being
subsidized by the parent organization's other activities (e.g., consultancy) or else have
been established by non-commercial organizations such as local enterprise agencies. As a
result, seed capital is a marginal activity for most venture capital funds in the U K . I n
1990 only 0.2% of UK funds invested and 0.7% of European Venture Capital
Association funds invested went into seed capital investments, compared with 4% of
venture capital investments in the USA (Murray 1992). This reflects the greater
attractions of MBOs and other late-stage deals compared with seed capital investment
(see Table 3).
Initiatives which change the economic structure of such funds are therefore required in
order to stimulate the availability of seed and start-up capital. However, to date such

which they have had no prior connection (i.e., it excludes investments in their own firm
or in a relative's business).
Informal investment is the largest single source of risk capital in the USA. Wetzel
(1986a, p. 121) suggests that they 'finance as many as twenty times the number of firms
financed by institutional venture capitalists', while 'the aggregate amount they invest is
perhaps twice as big' (Wetzel 1986b, p.88). Gaston (1989) suggests that informal
investors provide capital to over 40 times the number of firms receiving investments from
professional venture capital funds, and the amount of their investments almost exceeds
all other sources of external equity capital for new and growing small businesses
combined. Informal investors are particularly important in providing seed and start-up
finance. Freear and Wetzel (1988, p. 353) note that 'private individuals and venture
capital funds appear to play complementary . . . roles . . . . Private individuals are most
prominent at the early stages of a firm's development, when relatively small amounts are
involved, and in those later stage financings involving under $1 million.'
A further attraction of informal investments is that they are characterized by a high
level of geographic localization. Over half of all such investments in the USA are made in
firms within 50 miles of the investor's home or office. This is largely a reflection of the
'hands-on' nature of such investments, although it is also a function of superior
information available about investment opportunities close to home. Thus, ftom a
regional development perspective, informal investments are valuable because they help
to retain and recirculate wealth within a region.
Evidence is growing that informal investors also play a role in the provision of risk
capital in the U K . A number of recent surveys of the sources of finance used by small
businesses indicate that private individuals are the most important source of external
equity capital after family and relatives, utilized by between 2 % and 5 % of small firms,
compared with fewer than 1% who have utilized venture capital (Mason and Harrison
1990, Small Business Research Trust 1991).
There is little doubt that the number of informal investors has increased during the
past decade as a result of the greater opportunities for wealth accumulation by
entrepreneurs and senior managers in industry and commerce (ACOST 1990, Mason et
al. 1991a). These groups comprise the main sources of' informal investors. Nevertheless,
despite this increase the significance of informal investment in the UK remains small
when compared with the situation in the USA (ACOST 1990, Bannock 1991).
The supply of informal venture capital in the UK has been examined in two recent
surveys. First, a survey of 86 actual and potential1 informal investors (Mason et al. 19Yla)
found that the 60 active infornlal investors had invested £3.1 m in 172 business ventures
during the preceding three years (Table 10). However, informal investors are a
heterogeneous group, comprising at one extreme those who make one investment in a
lifetime, perhaps to help a friend set up in business, and at the other extreme those who
are continuously on the look-out for investment opportunities and who make frequent
and often relatively large investments. This heterogeneity is reflected in the survey:
whereas the average (median) amount invested by each 'active' informal investor was
£22,000, 20% of investors have invested over £ 100,000. The second study - a survey of
investors registered with LINC, a business introduction service (Mason et al. 1991b) - is
biased to the more active end of the spectrum. This is reflected in the larger amounts that
these investors have invested. Of the 53 respondents to the survey, 33 had made informal
investments during the preceding three years which amounted to over £ 5 m in 76
business ventures (Table 10). T h e median amount invested by each investor is £100,000.
Their investments include both direct equity funds and loans and loan guarantees. For

every £3 of equity invested, informal investors lend £1 to the businesses in which they
invest (4:l in the case of LINC investors). Such loans are likely to be more friendly,
patient and tolerant than those from traditional lending sources and so are, in effect,
quasi-equity capital.
Informal investors generally inject small amounts of capital into the firms in which
they invest - typically less than £10,000. Only a minority of business angels commit more
than £50,000 to a single investment. However, investors registered with LINC tend to
invest significantly larger amounts per deal (Table 10). Investments that are syndicated
between a number of investors involve larger deal sizes. Informal investors make
investments in all industry sectors. However, in comparison with venture capital funds,
they have a greater propensity to invest both in the manufacturing sector, which accounts
for about one-third of all investments, and in technology-based ventures which comprise
37% of all investments. Informal investors also make investments at all stages of
company development from pre-start-ups through to established firms. No stage
dominates, although seed, start-up, early-stage invcstlnents account for about half of all
deals made (Mason et al. 1991a, 1991b).
Comparison with the US informal risk capital market indicates that UK investors have
received information on significantly more investment opportunities and also seriously
considered more proposals but have invested in a smaller proportion ofthose which they
have seriously considered (Table 11). This may reflect the generally poorer quality of
proposals in the UK, or indicate that UK investors are relatively inefficient (or
insufficiently experienced) in identifying proposals worthy of serious consideration, or

that UK informal investors have different investment criteria from their US counterparts
(Harrison and Mason 1992a, 1992b).
The informal risk capital market in the U K is substantially larger than indicatcd by the
level of investment activity and the amount that investors have invested in the past three
years. Seven out of every ten informal investors would have invested more in the last
three years if they had come across a greater number of suitable investment
opportunities. Indeed, on average, business angels had a further &50,000 available for
investment. In aggregate, the sample of informal investors had up to £10 million
available for investment, equivalent to three times the total amount that they had
invested during the previous three years. Amongst LINC investors an even higher
proportion - 86% - would have invested more if they had come across sufficient
investment opportunities. They had an average 01'£100,000 still available for investment,
exceeding the amount that they had invested during the preceding three years (Table 12).

The high proportion of informal investors who have been unable to find sufficient
businesses in which to invest stems from shortcomings in the search process by
entrepreneurs and investors, although the paucity of good quality businesses may also
play a role. Most informal investors look for investment opportunities in an ad hoc
fashion, placing considerable reliance on friends and business associates for referrals, and
rarely adopt a pro-active search (Mason et al. 1991a). Entrepreneurs are hampered in
their search for private sources of venture capital by the anonymity which most informal
investors strive to preserve. Gaston (1989, p. 4) describes the informal venture capital
market as 'a giant game of hide-and-seek with everyone blindfolded'.
By extrapolating the survey evidence on the proportion of firms which have raiscd
finance from informal investors (see earlier discussion) and our findings on the deal size
of informal investments to the population of unquoted companies in the U K gives us a
very crude estimate of the size of the informal risk capital market of about f 2 bn to £4 bn,
taking into account both committed and uncommitted funds. To put this figure into
perspective, venture capital funds have invested about £ 1bn annually in the U K in
recent years, of which over half has been invested in management buy-outs (MBOs).
Moreover, the average size of informal investments is substantially lower than that of
venture capital funds, hence, the number of companies which have raised finance from
informal venture capital sources is significantly greater than the number of financings by
venture capital funds (1316 in 1990, of which 26% were MBOs).
This evidence suggests that the informal venture capital market in the U K is a
significant source of finance for small firms. Nevertheless, it remains relatively
undeveloped. We have noted, first, that informal investors have significant uncommitted
funds (see Table 12) and, second, that information channels linking investors and

<-----Page 16----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 00:46 23 March 2009

C. MASON ANI) R. H A K R ~ S O N

entrepreneurs appear to operate less efficiently than in the USA (Harrison and Mason
1992a, 1992b). This supports the argument that efforts are required to encourage this
market on the grounds that 'an active informal venture capital market is a pre-requisite
for a vigorous enterprise economy' (ACOST 1990, p. 41).
Two particular steps can be taken. First, there is a need to enlarge the pool of informal
risk capital. The relevant population from which informal investors are drawn, notably
wealthy business people and speculators, is much smaller in the UK compared with the
USA. However, the tendency for the salaries of senior employees to increase disproportionately, the widespread use of stock options which offer the prospect of capital
gains, the reduction in the top rate of income tax and the flotation or sale of businesses
established by successful entrepreneurs of the past decade will all have contributed to an
increase in the number of potential informal investors in the UK. Nevertheless, the bias
in the tax system towards institutional saving is a major constraint on informal
investment activity. Thus, there is a need to make the tax treatment of equity investment
in unquoted companies no less advantageous than other forms of saving in order to
encourage private investors to put some of their disposable wealth into smaller companies
(ACOST 1990).
The BES has provided tax incentives for personal equity investments in unquoted
companies. However, it has increasingly failed to fill the equity gap and, following its
extension to include investments in private rented housing, the scheme has largely ceased
to be a source of risk capital for small firms. But, instead of abolishing the BES
altogether, it would have been more appropriate to revise the scheme along the lines
suggested by Mason et al. (1988) in order to achieve its original goal of stimulating private
investments in small companies. Mason el al. (1988) identified three changes as being of
particular importance. First, property-related and asset-related businesses should be
excluded as they are clearly against the original spirit of the scheme and attract investors
looking for low-risk tax shelters. A further refinement would be to grade the tax relief
according to the type of company (e.g., age, sector) in which the investment is made.
Second, since most informal investors wish to play an active role in the companies in
which they invest, the rules which exclude investors who are 'closely connected' with the
company in which they invest should be relaxed. Third, it is also important that a
maximum company funding limit, originally introduced in 1988, is retained to prevent
companies from using the scheme to raise amounts that are well in excess of the equity
gap upper threshold and to avoid the situation whereby a large proportion of the total
finance raised through the scheme is invested in a relatively small number of companies.
The second, and more important, step is to mobilize more efectively the pool of
informal risk capital by establishing mechanisms for bringing investors into contact with
businesses seeking equity capital, and vice versa. Both the search by a business for an
investor, and the search by an investor for an investment opportunity 'can
b e . . . expensive, time-consuming affairls]. The search is studded with pitfalls and dead
ends that often result in failure and frustration' (Gaston 1989, p. 1). This reflects various
inefficiencies in the operation of the informal risk capital market, notably the invisibility
of business angels, the fragmented nature of the market and the imperfect channels of
communication between bona fide entrepreneurs seeking risk capital and investors
seeking investment opportunities (Wetzel 1986a, 1986b, 1987). The outcome is a
'discouragement effect' - analogous to the discouraged worker effect in labour markets which curtails the search for equity capital by both entrepreneurs and would-be
entrepreneurs and the search by would-be business angels for investment opportunities,
to the detriment of economic development. We have already noted that most business

<-----Page 17----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 00:46 23 March 2009

A STRATEGY FOR CLOSING T H E EQUITY GAP

3 73

angels in the UK would have invested more in the last three years if they had come across
a greater number of suitable investment opportunities (Table 12).
The establishment of business introduction services (alternatively termed financial
marriage bureaux) - analogous to dating services for lonely hearts - to provide an
efficient channel of communication between informal investors and entrepreneurs
represents the most common approach to overcoming these sources of inefficiency in the
informal risk capital market.* The simplest method of introducing potential investors to
entrepreneurs seeking finance, and vice versa, is through the production and distribution
of an investment bulletin, giving a brief description of companies seeking capital, which
is circulated to potential investors. Those investors wishing further information on any
particular investment opportunity can obtain this from the introduction service. Another
method involves investors' meetings at which entrepreneurs seeking to raise finance
make short presentations to an audience of potential investors.
A more sophisticated approach involves computer matching. This approach was
pioneered by the Venture Capital Network (VCN) which was established in New
England in 1984 (Wetzel 1984, Foss 1985, Wetzel 1992). There are at least another 14
computer match-making services in various parts of the USA and one in Canada, some
of these cloned from V C N (Mason and Harrison 1992). Computer match-making
services all work in essentially the same manner. Investors and entrepreneurs pay a
subscription fee to join. 'They each complete a short questionnaire: investors provide
information on the investment opportunities that are of greatest interest; entrepreneurs
provide information on the characteristics of their business venture and submit a business
plan summary. Once the questionnaires are computerized a two-stage matching process
takes place. First, the computer searches among its investor subscribers for investors
whose investment preferences match the characteristics of the business seeking finance.
When matches are found, an executive summary of the business plan is sent to the
matched-up investor. The investor can then request further information. U p to this stage
names are not disclosed to either party. If the investor wishes to meet the entrepreneur
the match-making service will provide names and telephone numbers to each party. The
role of the match-making service ends at this point. What happens after direct contact is
made is strictly a matter for the investor and entrepreneur.
Because the involvement of match-making services ends at the introduction stage it is
impossible to assess accurately the number of deals that they help to bring about. Thus,
their performance must be mcasured in terms of the number of matches that they bring
about. In the case of V C N , it has served about 1200 entrepreneur clients and about 800
investor clients, generating approximately 35,000 computer matches (first-stage
matches) which resulted in approximately 3500 investor requests to be put in contact
with entrepreneurs. V C N is aware of 31 ventures that have raised a total of $12 million
through this process. However, as V C N does not systematically follow up the outcome of
such contacts this must be regarded as an under-estimate of the number of deals which
have resulted (Wetzel 1992).
There are a number of local financial match-making services in the UK (Small
Business Research Trust 1988), the best known of which are Venture Capital Report (VCR)
and the Local Investment Networking Company, commonly known as LINC. V C R is a
monthly publication, started in 1978, containing information on businesses seeking
mainly seedcorn investment, which is circulated to subscribers (Cary 1991). LINC was
established in 1987 to integrate the financial marriage bureaux of various local enterprise
agencies into a nation-wide business introduction servicc. It currently has 11 member
agencies. LINC publishes an investors' bulletin, organizes investors' meetings in various
parts of the country and also provides a computer matching facility.

Both V C R and LINC have played significant roles in promoting the concept of
informal investment activity in the U K and have had some success in generating
informal investment activity. Nevertheless, in each case the scale of operation and
achievements have been modest. First, our research has indicated that neither
organization is particularly widely known amongst small business owners and their
professional advisers or by informal investors. Second, both organizations have a small
investor base. V C R has about 400 subscribers, fewer than half of whom are private
individuals, while LINC's current membership is around 250. Third, the scale of
informal investment activity has been limited. LINC's investment statistics show that at
June 1990 its registered investors had 256 m available for investment; however, they had
invested only £3 million in a total of 52 companies." Fourth, since the vast majority of
informal investors wish to make local investments (i.e., within 100 miles of homelwork)
there must be doubts about whether the national match-making service that is offered by
LINC and V C R holds much attraction to most of their members. Moreover, LINC
provides only a patchy geographical coverage while V C R tends to favour southern-based
businesses. Finally, our survey came across varying degrees of dissatisfaction with
existing business introduction services which, at least in part, reflects differences between
the business introduction service which perceives its role as ending when an introduction
is made, and investors who expect the intermediary to be more directly involved in the
match-making process. In view of this, it is not surprising that the clear balance of
opinion amongst the informal investors in our survey was that there ren~ainsa need for
improved channels of communication between investors and businesses seeking risk
capital (Figure 1).
We therefore advocate that there should be a substantial increase in the scale of
business introduction activity in the U K in order to provide a further stimulus to the
informal risk capital market. Such services should be established on a regional or subregional basis since most investors prefer to invest in businesses located close to home
because of their desire to play a 'hantis-on' role. To be credible with both investors and
firms a business introduction service needs to be managed by a respected but
disinterested third party with broad-bascd community support which operates on a notfor-profit basis. Examples include local enterprise agencies, chambers of commerce (as in
the case of C O I N in Canada), universities (as in the case of V C N in the USA) and
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) and Local Enterprise Companies, their
Scottish equivalents. Both entrepreneurs and investors would be comfortable that such
organizations are genuinely interested in fostering local economic development, have no
vested interest in encouraging inappropriate matches and would maintain strict
confidentiality. Moreover, because of their visibility and contacts with the business
community such organizations are accessible to investors and entrepreneurs
(Government of Ontario 1986).
Organizations which provide business introduction services should perceive their role
to be much broader than simply managing the match-making process. First, since a key
determinant of the success of such organizations is the volume of businesses and investors
that they are able to recruit it is important that they undertake an active marketing of the
service. Second, they may need to educate businesses and investors in aspects of equity
investment (e.g., realistic pricing of equity). Third, there is an expectation amongst

equally, such businesses will expect investors to be bona fide. Fourth, such organizations
need to play a 'hand holding' role by helping businesses in their prescntation. Finally,
they should aim, as part of the service, to build personal relationships amongst informal

investors in order to encourage greater syndication of deals; one of the contrasts between
informal risk capital activity in the U K and the USA is the much higher proportion of
informal investments made by groups of business angels in the USA (Harrison and
Mason 1992a, b).
However, the experience of business introduction organizations in the USA and
Canada suggests that such services cannot be operated as a profit-making activity. The
creation and rapid disappearance of a considerable number of private-sector matchmaking services in the U K during the last five years or so would also seem to confirm the
difficulty of operating such an activity on a commercial basis. The main source of
revenue for business introduction services is the subscription fees levied on firms and
investors. However, investors are generally averse to paying for information on
investment opportunities: our survey noted that just over half of informal investors
would not be prepared to pay for such information, even if it was pre-screened according

<-----Page 20----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 00:46 23 March 2009

to their investment criteria. Thus, the amount of revenue that can be generated from this
source is limited. For example, LINC's annual subscription rates are £50 for
entrepreneurs and £75 for investors. VCN's fees are $250 per annum for individual
investors, $500 for institutional investors and $1000 for overseas investors. Its fee for
entrepreneurs is $125 for a six-month registration (Wetzel 1992). Although there is no
evidence as to whether higher subscriptions would deter investors or firms it seems
plausible to suggest that they are fairly price sensitive.' Thus, the charges levied by
business introduction services cannot get too much out of line with alternative investment
communication channels such as specialist magazines and newspaper advertisements.
The level of income that can be raised from subscriptions is therefore unlikely to be
sufficient to cover the operating costs of a business introduction service. Indeed, such
services generally rely on sponsorship from their host organizations (e.g., chambers of
commerce, universities), the corporate sector and economic development organizations
or through an endowment. For example, V C N has been sponsored by accountants,
banks, a firm of lawyers, a computer company, and the University of New Hampshire
and MIT. LINC receives sponsorship from Lloyds Bank, chartered accountants Levy
Gee and British Petroleum plc. The Venture Capital Exchange in Tulsa is funded by a
charitable foundation (Hisrich 1988). The one major exception is V C R which has been
able to operate profitably by charging the business a 'success fee' calculated on the basis
of the risk capital raised (defined broadly to include loans and loan guarantees) in
addition to the standard subscription fees levied on businesses and subscribers to the
magazine. However, even this method of raising revenue enables V C R to make only a
modest profit and is insufficient to allow its range of services to be broadened (Cary
1992). Many US and Canadian commentators argue that it is inappropriate for business
introduction services to have any financial interest in the outcome of the negotiations
which follow the introduction since it rnight be perceived by businesses and investors as
compromising their impartiality, while any attempt to run a business introduction
service on a for-profit basis is likely to reduce its credibility amongst both investors and
firms (Mason and Harrison 1992). For all these reasons we believe that public-sector
intervention - for example, by providing some form of operating subsidy - is required to
achieve a significant increase in the number and scale of financial match-making
activities in the U K which, in turn, is necessary for businesses to tap more efectively the
pool of informal venture capital that is available for investment.
The U K Government has responded favourably to this suggestion by providing some
modest financial support for the expansion of business introduction services. Eric Forth
MP, then Small Firms Minister, stated in October 1990 that one 'very tentative idea'
was for the government to back the creation of a marriage-broking service for investors
and entrepreneurs (Financial Times,23 October 1990). Following a visit to the USA in the
spring of 1991 where he examined some match-making organizations in detail, his
department invited bids from the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England
and Wales to operate a small number of pilot business introduction services in
conjunction with other local organizations. The Department will provide £20,000 per
annum for two years to support the establishment of these services. Five projects were
selected from a total of 19 bids: Bedfordshire, Calclerdale and Kirklees, Devon and Cornwall, east Lancashire and south and east Cheshire (Table 13). A number of other TECs
are known to be planning to establish their own business referral services. Scottish
Enterprise is also investigating the feasibility of establishing a similar service.
Ultimately, as Wetzel (1987), who pioneered the study of informal risk capital in the
USA and was instrumental in establishing V C N , has noted, the case for government

intervention to promote inforrnal investment activity rests on the external, or public,
benefits which arise from the resulting increased entrepreneurial activity. Thcre is a
social cost in terms of lost opportunities to launch new enterprises or expand established
ones if entrepreneurs prematrtrely abandon their search for funds. Conversely, publicsector intervention to overcome market inefficiencies in the financing of small businesses
such as that advocated in this paper will generate external social benefits such as the
enhanced flow of new jobs, the diffusion of innovative tcchnoloLgy and increased tax
revenues.

Conclusion

There is widespread agreement that, despite a range of public- and pl-ivttte-sector
initiatives in the UK during the last decade or so, the continued existence of an equity
gap constrains the development of companies seeking to raise small amounts of risk
capital. However, the cause of this equity gap is a more contentious subject. Suppliers of
risk capital argue that the equity gap is largely a demand-side phenomenon, refccting the
low quality and poor presentation of investment proposals. In contrast, we side with the
alternative view that the equity gap is largely a function of supply-side constraints which
reflect the restrictive investment preferences of the venture capital industry (by sector, by
stage of company and by location) and the economics of the investment appraisal and
monitoring processes. Recent developments, such as the European Seed Capital Fund
(ESCF) initiative and the Business in the Community (RIC) regional enterprise fund
proposal, are unlikely to provide a full resolution of the problems faced by new and small
firms seeking outside equity finance. In the case of the ESCF, the scale of thc funds
available (approximately 40 m ECUs) is relatively small and the funds are unlikely to be
able to operate without long-term subsidy, which cannot be guaranteed. In the case of
the BIC initiative (which has still not completed its fund raising) the funds will be
targeted at established businesses rather than at seed and start-up investments.
I n these circumstances, encouragement of the informal risk capital market becomes an
important option fbr small firm policy makers. The pool of informal venture capital in

the UK is already significant (estimated at between £2 bn and £4bn, compared with an
annual investment of around £1 bn by the formal venture capital industry).
Furthermore, there is strong evidence to suggest that the market operates inefficiently:
case study evidence suggests that UK informal investors may be less sophisticated than
their US equivalents in terms of their investment opportunity search processes, screening
and evaluation criteria and investment behaviour (Harrison and Mason 1991), and
survey evidence that is reported in this paper indicates that informal investors have up to
three times as much capital available for investment as they have already invested. One
immediate step which could be taken, therefore, to stimulate the flow of informal venture
capital to potential investee businesses is the establishment of a network of locally or
regionally based and managed business introduction services. However, in view of the
economics of operating such services, which are unlikely to be capable of operating on a
non-subsidized for-profit basis, government intervention is required if the development
of the informal risk capital market is to occur.

Actual investors are dctined as those responclcnts who have rnade at least one informal investrncnt durirlg
the previous threc years. Potential investors arc defined as rcspondcnts who arc interested in rnaking
informal investments: sorrie have made informal irivcst~ncntain thc past but not during the prcccding
threc years and most have come across bur rejected investnient opportunities within the past thrcc years.
Business introduction services d o not undertake any evaluation of thc business opportunities nor make
any endorsements o r recon~menclations.
However, its recent performance is rnorc impressive, with 11 investments arranged through L I N C
during the first half of 1992, involving approximately f300,000 ( L I N C Bullelin, ,June 1992).
O u r survey of L I N C investor a n d entrepreneur clierrts indicated that a majority would be prepared to
pay a higher fee if accompanied by the introduc~ionof aclditio~ialser\~iccs.Hvwcver, the maximum that
