would such differences be expected to exist in the first place? Why-s-and when-would
the thinking of entrepreneurs be expected to differ from that of other people? To answer
this question, it is necessary to take a brief look at some of the basic findings of research
on human cognition-findings that appear to be directly relevant to entrepreneurship.

A NOTE ON HUMAN COGNITION: SOME KEY FINDINGS WITH
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Systematic research on human cognition has continued for more than a century. However, progress has been especially rapid during the past two decades. as the growing
power of computers has placed new and highly sophisticated research tools into the
hands of cognitive scientists. As a result of this recent work. we now possess a relatively
clear picture of many aspects of human cognition-how we think. reason. decide. use
language and symbols, store information for future use. and so on (see. e.g .. Barsalou
1992). Whereas this scientific literature points to many conclusions. among the ones
most relevant to entrepreneurship are these:
• Our capacity to process new information about the world around us is severely
limited and can readily be exceeded (an outcome cognitive psychologists describe
as overload). Anyone who has been unable to follow the arguments presented by
a speaker because they are offered too quickly is quite familiar with these limits.
• As human beings. we seek to minimize cognitive ej[ort. iust as weseek to minimize
physical effort. As a result, we ojten use various "short-cuts" in 0111' thinking. techniques that reduce menta! e!frnt. Whereas these are often effective in this respect.
they have an important downside as well: they sometimes lead to serious errors
in our efforts to understand the world around us.
• Because ofour limited information-processing capacity, our tendcni:v to minimize
menta! cjfon. and several other [actors (e).~., the powerful impact of emotions on
thought). we are often less than totallv rationol in 0111' thinking. In [act. various
aspects o] human cognition are subicc! 10 a wide range of biases and errors.
Although these conclusions apply to all human beings. they seem to have special
relevance to entrepreneurs for the following reason: entrepreneurs may regularly find
themselves in situations that tend to maximize the potential impact of various biases
and errors. Research on this issue (the question of when we are most likely to fall short
of the goal of completely rational thought) suggests that cognitive processes are most
likely to be influenced by various forms of bias and error whcn:
• overload occurs-individuals are confronted with more information than they
can process at a given time (e.g .. Gilbert et al. llJl(2)
• individuals face situations that are new to them and involve high degrees ofuncertainty-situations in which they cannot readily fall back upon existing mental
frameworks (known as schernasin cognitive psychology) (Fiske and Taylor 19lJl)
• emotions run high-there is a complex interplay between feelings and thought.
and intense emotions can produce distortions in many aspects of cognition
(Oaksford et al. ]lJl)6)
