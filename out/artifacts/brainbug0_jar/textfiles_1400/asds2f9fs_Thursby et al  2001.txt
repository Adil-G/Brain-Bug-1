<-----Page 0----->Objectives, Characteristics and Outcomes
of University Licensing: A Survey of
Major U.S. Universities

ABSTRACT. This paper describes results of our survey of
licensing at 62 research universities. We consider ownership,
income splits, stage of development, marketing, license policies and characteristics, goals of licensing and the role of the
inventor in licensing. Based on these results we analyze the
relationship between licensing outcomes and both the objectives of the TTO and the characteristics of the technologies.
Patent applications grow one-to-one with disclosures, while
sponsored research grows similarly with licenses executed.
Royalties are typically larger the higher the quality of the
faculty and the higher the fraction of licenses that are executed at latter stages of development. Sponsored research is
more likely to be included in a license if the new technology is
at an early stage of development or if the TTO evaluates it as
important. We find that additional disclosures generate smaller
percentage increases in licenses, and those increases in licenses generate smaller percentage increases in royalties.

1. Introduction
University licensing has increased dramatically
since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980,
which gave universities the right to retain title to
and license inventions resulting from federallysponsored research. The 1996 Sur¨ ey of the Association of Uni¨ ersity Technology Managers ŽAUTM,
1998. reports that licenses executed increased
75% percent between 1991 and 1996, with 13,087
executed over the entire period. Understanding
this phenomenon is important because, while uni1

versities are considered critical to industrial innovation, our understanding of the way research is
transferred to industry is based largely on studies
of spillovers.1
To this end, we recently conducted a survey of
the technology transfer offices ŽTTOs. of 62 major U.S. universities. We focused on policies related to ownership of inventions, the nature of
university inventions, license policies and strategies, as well as university objectives in licensing.
For both patentable and copyrightable inventions,
we find that the majority of universities retain
title to inventions, but all universities split the
income with inventors. We also find that the
majority of inventions are at an early stage of
development when they are licensed, and that
inventor involvement in the process is important,
not only for finding licensees, but also for further
development once licenses are executed. Indeed,
almost half of the inventions licensed are only a
proof of concept at the time of license. It is not
surprising then that the licenses executed include
payment schemes that induce inventor involvement in development and do not obligate the
licensees to large up-front payments. That is,
agreements almost always include running royalties and small up-front fees, often include sponsored research, and less frequently include equity
positions in the licensee. Royalties generate the
lion’s share of the revenue generated by university licensing.
Unlike the private sector, where success is
measured by profits, university goals are more
diverse. In addition to generating royalties and
sponsored research, universities Žin particular,
public universities . are expected to contribute to
economic development. To the extent that this

goal is important, we expect TTOs to value the
signing of a license or the commercialization of
an invention, regardless of the monetary rewards.
Indeed, the majority of TTO professionals responding to our survey indicated as much.
There is a growing literature on university licensing Že.g. Jensen and Thursby, 1999; Mowery
et al., 1999; Mowery and Ziedonis, 1999; Siegel,
Waldman, and Link, 1999; Thursby and Kemp,
2000; and Thursby and Thursby, 2000a.. Our survey contributes to that literature by providing
evidence from a broad spectrum of universities on
their objectives, as well as a new evidence on the
nature of inventions licensed. The first six sections of the paper present survey results. In Section 7, we examine an econometric model that
relates licensing outcomes Že.g., sponsored research, royalties, patents. to the stated objectives
of the TTO and invention characteristics. One
interesting result is that invention characteristics
are important for several outcomes. In particular,
royalties are lower and sponsored research is
more likely when the new technology is licensed
at an early stage of development. Surprisingly,
TTO objectives are significantly related to only
one outcome; sponsored research is less likely in
a license agreement when the TTO evaluates it as
not very important.
We also find that the elasticity of licenses with
respect to disclosures and royalties with respect
to licenses are both less than one, suggesting a
declining marginal value of disclosed inventions.
While this could reflect a decrease in the importance of university inventions to industry Žsee
Henderson, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg, 1998; and
Mowery and Ziedonis, 1999 for evidence pro and
con., it could be the result of an increased willingness or propensity of faculty to disclose their
research results Žas shown by Thursby and
Thursby, 2000a.. Whether the increased propensity of faculty to disclose is simply a response to
financial incentives or an increase in the effectiveness of TTOs in inducing disclosure is an
open question.
2. Survey design and characteristics of the sample
Survey questionnaires were sent to the top 135
U.S. universities in terms of licensing revenue as
reported in the 1996 AUTM Sur¨ ey. The ques-

tionnaire was pretested on eleven experienced
university technology transfer professionals from
both public and private universities. After they
completed a draft survey, these professionals were
interviewed in an effort to remove ambiguities
from the questionnaire.
Sixty-two universities responded, giving a response rate of 46%. The majority of universities
responding were public, and of the public universities responding, 62% were land-grant institutions. Private universities accounted for 37% of
the responses. Average industry sponsored research for universities in the sample was $16.9
million in 1996, and federally sponsored research
was $149.6 million. The average TTO in the sample reported 26.3 licenses executed, 92.3 inventions disclosures, 30.1 new patent applications
and $4.2 million in income for 1996. Compared to
the 131 U.S. universities who responded to the
1996 AUTM survey, the respondents to our survey represent 68% of industry sponsored research, 75% of federally sponsored research, 71%
of royalty income, 74% of the licenses executed,
70% of the invention disclosures and 48% of the
new patent applications.
A substantial portion Ž35%. of respondents
indicated that their office had been reorganized
since 1990. This is not surprising given the dramatic growth in licensing activity. Few Ž13%. of
the TTOs reported that their office is part of a
foundation, and 20% reported that the university
has a foundation that provides support for the
TTO. Only 15% of the TTOs are corporations
that are separate from their universities, and 4.8%
are for-profit. On average, 42% of the support for
the TTOs is based on a ‘‘line item’’ in the university budget and 43% comes from royaltiesrlicense
fees. Most Ž80%. of the TTOs report directly to
an academic university official Žtypically, the vice
president for research . rather than a university
business or finance official. More than 40% use
brokers or consultants to aid the TTO.
3. Policies on ownership and income
A potentially important element in examining
university objectives in licensing is the ownership
of inventions. Since the passage of the Bayh-Dole
Act of 1980, universities can elect to retain title
to patentable inventions resulting from federally

<-----Page 2----->A Sur¨ ey of Major U.S. Uni¨ ersities

funded research. For both patentable and copyrightable inventions, we asked ‘‘Who owns inventions and materials made or developed by faculty
or other personnel in your university?’’ Respondents were given three choices: ‘‘university,’’ ‘‘inventor’’ and ‘‘other.’’ All but one university in the
sample indicated that the university owns patentable inventionsrmaterials. For copyrightable inventions, 66% indicated that the university was
the owner, and 48% and 15% said ownership
resided with the inventor or other, respectively.
Note that a number of respondents indicated
several owners of copyrightable inventions; this
follows from different policies for different types
of copyrightable materials; for example, most universities retain rights to copyrightable software
but not to books.
While the university typically retains ownership, they nonetheless split net income from inventions with the inventor. Respondents were
asked to give the percent of net income for each
of the categories patentable inventionsrmaterials
and copyrightable materials going to each of the
following groups: ‘‘university,’’ ‘‘inventors,’’ ‘‘inventor department or school,’’ ‘‘technology transfer office’’ and ‘‘other.’’
For patentable inventionsrmaterials, the universities in our sample gave an average of 40% of
net income to the inventors and 16% to the
inventor’s department or school. Departments and
schools often return their portion to the inventor’s
lab. For some universities, it is possible for as
much as 75% of net income to be under the
control of an inventor.2 On average, central administrations and TTOs take 26% and 11%, respectively, of the income from licensing. Nearly
30% of the respondents indicated that the central
administration receives no royalty income, but
those universities generally allocate income to the
TTO. Over 30% of the universities allocate a
portion of income directly to the TTO and these
universities allocate, on average, over one third of
income to the TTO. Finally, 8% of income is
allocated to ‘‘other.’’ For copyrightable materials,
the average amounts are similar though the inventors receive about 5% more of net income.
Proceeds from the liquidation of equity are distributed differently from other revenue sources in
23% of the universities responding.

61

To provide perspective on the income figures,
consider the AUTM 1997 survey results ŽAUTM,
1997. on income and cashed-in equity. One hundred and twenty-four U.S. universities Žincluding
solely university hospitals. reported a total of
around $375 million in license income received
net of legal fees and income paid to other universities. If we assume 40% of that accrues to inventors, then the faculty inventors at those 124 universities received license income of almost $150
million in 1997. Not surprisingly, this income is
highly skewed over inventors; our respondents
report, on average, that 76% of license revenue is
attributed to their top five inventions. Fourteen
of the universities in the 1997 AUTM survey
report $21 million in cashed-in equity; 108 universities report $0 from cashed-in equity.
Finally, 90% of the universities in our sample
allow faculty to establish and operate businesses
based on technology owned by the university but
developed in the course of the faculty’s own research.
4. Nature, source and marketing of
university technologies
University research, particularly that which is federally funded, is usually considered more basic
than applied. For this sample, 67% of inventions
disclosed in the prior five years were the result of
federally sponsored research and only 19% came
from industry sponsored research. Thus we would
expect inventions licensed to be basic or nascent
as compared to inventions that are ready for use
or sale. There are, however, a number of ways to
characterize the nature of inventions. Prior studies have tended to characterize university technologies in terms of their end use or the academic field contributing to the technology. Cohen
et al. Ž1998., Adams Ž1998., and Rosenberg Ž1992.,
for example, point to industrial use of research
techniques and instruments developed in universities. In their analysis of spillovers through publication citation, Adams Ž1990. and Jaffe Ž1989.
focus on the role of particular science and engineering disciplines. Similarly, Mansfield Ž1995.
and Mansfield and Lee’s Ž1996. survey work focuses on the disciplines that contribute most to
new products and processes. With the exception
of chemistry and mathematics, these studies tend

<-----Page 3----->62

Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby

to highlight the contributions of the more applied
disciplines, particularly those in engineering.
In our survey, we asked about the percentage
of inventions disclosed by faculty in particular
schools within the university. We found that 33
percent of the inventions disclosed came from
medical schools, 29 percent from engineering
schools, 22 percent from schools of science, 6
percent from schools of agriculture, with the remainder scattered across schools of business, education, and liberal arts.
For our purposes, a more relevant characterization of inventions is in terms of distance from
application. We therefore asked a series of questions about the stage of development of inventions when they are licensed. Respondents were
asked ‘‘What percentage of the inventions that
were licensed in the last five years were in the
following stages of development at the time the
license was negotiated?’’ The stages listed are
standard categories used in TTO evaluation of
invention disclosures. The results, shown in Table
I, overwhelmingly support the notion that university technologies are embryonic by any standards.
Manufacturing feasibility of the technologies licensed was known for only 15% of the inventions
licensed, and fewer Ž12%. were ready for practical or commercial use. The overwhelming majority were either a proof of concept stage Ž45%. or
a lab scale prototype Ž37%..
As further evidence on the early stage of university inventions, 71% of licensed inventions are
viewed as requiring inventor cooperation for commercial success. Respondents said that special-

ized faculty knowledge is generally considered
necessary for firms to be willing to license and
develop early stage technologies that are typically
years away from commercial application. While
faculty do not generally own inventions, they are
clearly an important stakeholder not only because
it is their decision whether or not to disclose, but
it also their decision whether or not to cooperate
in further development of inventions.
Evidence on patent protection at the time of
licensing can also be interpreted as a measure
of the embryonic nature of technologies, since
patents are often applied for when commercial
viability is known. In response to the question,
‘‘How often are the technologies that you license
protected by a patent issued or a copyright registered at the time you negotiate the license agreement?,’’ only 12% of respondents said ‘‘almost
always’’ and 13% said ‘‘often,’’ whereas 48% said
‘‘sometimes’’ and 28% said ‘‘rarely.’’
The embryonic nature of these inventions affects their marketing, the types of firms to whom
they are licensed, and the characteristics of license agreements. In terms of the types of companies that license early stage inventions, 40% of
the respondents could not tell a difference in the
size of companies that license early and late stage
inventions. On the other hand, 60% indicated
that small companies were more likely to take
early stage technologies and large companies were
more likely to take late stage. None of the respondents indicated that early stage technologies
tended to go to large firms and late stage to small
firms. These results accord well with results from
the literature on agency costs, which suggests that
small firms may have advantages in ‘‘innovative’’
research Žsee, for example, Holmstrom, 1989.
We asked TTOs an open ended question about
the procedures used to market inventions. The
practices given fall into six categories and are
listed in Table II. The role of inventors is apparent here, with 58% of the respondents listing
inventor contacts as useful for marketing. It is
also likely that some of the 75% of TTOs who
listed personal contacts as important were referring to the personal contacts of faculty. In a
recent survey of businesses who license-in university technologies, Thursby and Thursby Ž2000b.
found that 46% of respondents said that personal
contacts between their R&D staff and university

personnel Ži.e., faculty. were extremely important
in identifying technologies to license. Our results
also accord with Jansen and Dillon’s Ž1999. report
that 56% of the primary leads for license adoptions in 1100 licenses they examined came from
faculty. These results on the importance of the
faculty in finding licensees follows, we believe,
from the generally early stage of university technologies since, for such technologies, it is the
faculty who are able best to articulate the value
and nature of such technologies.
Products and processes based on early stage
technologies are often years away from commercialization. Further, it is difficult to specify royalty
income based on sales Ži.e., running royalties. for
very early stage technologies since the nature of
the final product is often unknown, and it is
difficult to define a royalty schedule for a product
whose final nature is diffuse. These factors can

63

discourage firms from entering into license contracts with universities. We asked respondents
how often more than one company expresses interest in a technology by signing confidentiality
agreements or by bidding for a license. Results
are in Table III. Note that it is common for
multiple companies to examine a technology, but
that it is much less frequent for multiple companies to become involved in license discussions
Žsee also Ziedonis, 1999.. This follows in large
part, we believe, from a ‘‘thin’’ market for early
stage technologies. Further evidence for this can
be found in the results of a survey of industry
licensing executives reported in Thursby and
Thursby Ž2000b.. Of 300 respondents, nearly
two-thirds did not license from universities and,
of these, 49% cited the early stage of development of university technologies as an important
reason for not licensing from universities.
In part, we asked these questions in order to
determine whether results from the theoretical
literature on optimal patent licensing are useful
in explaining the observed characteristics of university licenses. The main result of that literature
is that licensor revenue is maximized by the use
of a lump-sum fee determined by an auction and
paid up-front Žsee Kamien, 1992.. Our survey
results indicate that licenses are rarely determined by an auction, primarily because the early
nature of university inventions makes it difficult
to find more than one potential licensee. As
discussed in the next section, the early stage of

development has other implications for license
characteristics.
5. License payment policies and characteristics
A number of survey questions dealt with terms of
payment. These and their responses are found in
Table IV. As noted above, the theoretical literature concludes that an up-front fee is the optimal
method of licensing. That analysis, however, assumes that the value of the invention is certain
and obvious to all. In that case, the TTO and
licensee can both determine the value of the
license, so it is easy to see how they can reach an
agreement that allows the university to collect the
entire payment immediately, rather than wait for
royalties to accumulate over time. In fact, in this
certainty case, it is likely that there will be more
than one firm interested in the technology, so the
university can simply auction off the license.
However, Jensen and Thursby Ž1999. analyze licensing policies when there is substantial uncertainty about the value of the invention, as is the
case for embryonic university technologies. They
show that, in this uncertainty case, the TTO
should use both output-based payments, such as
royalties or equity, and up-front fees, and that
these fees should tend to be smaller the more
uncertain is the technology.
Their results correspond quite well with the
responses in Table IV. The overwhelming pay-

ment of choice is running royalties Žpayments
based on the output or sales of the licensee .
which are included ‘‘almost always’’ in licenses by
81% of respondents and ‘‘often’’ by 16% of respondents. After royalties, the most common form
of payment is patent fee reimbursement, included
almost always by 68% and often by 21%. Up-front
fees are also used, included almost always by 66%
and often by 26% of respondents, while annual or
minimum royalty fees are included almost always
by 57% and often by 32% of respondents.
Evidence on the embryonic nature of university inventions is reported in Section 4. Regarding
payment issues for early stage technologies, we
asked ‘‘For technologies which are in an early
stage of development Že.g., proof of concept but
no prototype, or prototype at lab scale only.,
which forms of payment are most difficult to
negotiate?’’ The overwhelming response was upfront fees, cited by nearly 64% of all respondents.
As noted above, Jensen and Thursby Ž1999.
find that the up-front fees that a TTO can obtain
will be smaller the more uncertain is the technology being licensed. This finding is supported by
the survey results. We asked ‘‘What do you think
is the most important factor in determining a
licensee’s willingness to pay a substantial up-front
fee?’’ By a large margin, the most frequent choice
was the value perceived by the licensee, noted by
nearly 46% of respondents. After this, the most
common responses were the viability of the tech-

nology at 28%, the degree of development at
26%, and the size of the market with 21%. Fewer
than 10% of respondents mentioned the size of
the company and the exclusivity of the license.
Obviously, the TTO can obtain a nontrivial upfront fee only if the invention is far enough along
in the development process that its viability is
reasonably well-established, and the licensee expects it to have substantial value. We find it
interesting that, in the absence of this likelihood
of a substantial payoff, the offer of an exclusive
license is not enough to induce the licensee to
make a substantial up-front payment.
We also asked ‘‘Have you ever negotiated a
license agreement in which the only form of payment was an up-front fee?’’ Although 69% of
respondents replied yes, most of these undoubtedly involved software or reagent materials with
evident viability and value. Rather, we find it
remarkable that 31% of respondents had never
been able to negotiate an agreement that used
only an up-front fee.
Another interesting aspect of these responses
is that license agreements that involve the university taking equity in the licensee are not very
common. Note in Table IV that no TTO responded that their license agreements almost always include equity, while 8% responded often
and only 32% even responded ‘‘sometimes.’’ Conversely, 42% and 18% responded their agreements ‘‘rarely’’ or ‘‘never’’ include equity. However, when equity is included, it is used, to some
extent, as a substitute for royalties and fees. When
we asked how often agreements with equity also
included running royalties and license fees, the
percentage of respondents who replied almost
always declined to 69% for royalties and 44% for
fees.
The lack of equity is particularly surprising in
light of the finding by Jensen and Thursby Ž1999.
that equity not only provides the same development incentives as royalties Žbecause both are
based on outputrsales., but also generates greater
revenue. Nevertheless, our survey found some
resistance to the use of equity by some universities. We asked ‘‘Does your university place restrictions on the use of equity in a license agreement?’’ Interestingly, two-thirds responded that
there were no restrictions, and restrictions varied
among the remaining third. Four respondents said

65

they cannot take equity positions. Limits on the
percent of equity that the university can take
were most common, varying from 5% to less than
a controlling interest, with 10% the most common
limit. Restrictions to avoid conflict of interest are
also typical.
Our final question regarding license payment
terms has to do with sponsored research. Results
are in Table IV. Agreements with sponsored research are quite common, as 40% of respondents
said their licenses include it often and another
39% said theirs include it sometimes. Although
only 6% said their licenses almost always include
sponsored research, only 14% said their licenses
rarely or never included it. The use of sponsored
research as a license payment is typically to assist
in the development of an embryonic technology
to viable commercial stage, and in Section 7 below we provide evidence on the use of sponsored
research with early stage technologies. Finally,
74% of respondents note that, when licenses do
include sponsored research, they almost always
involve the option to negotiate an exclusive license.
6. TTO licensing objectives
Unlike the private sector where profits are the
ultimate objective, university objectives are more
diverse.3 We asked about the importance of five
objectives. We asked respondents ‘‘How important to you are the following as measures of
success?’’ The outcomes listed were: Ž1. royaltiesrlicense fees generated, Ž2. sponsored research funds, Ž3. number of licensesroptions
signed, Ž4. number of patents awarded and Ž5.
number of inventions commercialized. For each
objective, the TTO could indicate ‘‘not very important,’’ ‘‘moderately important’’ or ‘‘extremely
important.’’ Respondents were also given an opportunity to indicate that an outcome was ‘‘Not
applicable.’’ Results can be found in Table V.
The most important objective to the TTO is
clearly royalties and fees generated, as 71% of
respondents said they are extremely important,
and only one respondent said they are not important. The next most important objective is the
number of inventions commercialized, with 61%
of respondents indicating extremely important and
31% moderately important. The number of li-

censes signed follows closely, with 49% and 44%
indicating extremely and moderately important.
Next was sponsored research funds, with only
34% of respondents reporting extremely important and 13% not important. Finally, the number
of patents awarded was the least important outcome to the TTO, with 53% reporting moderately
important and 31% not important.
7. Licensing outcomes
In this Section, we examine several econometric
models that relate our survey results on invention
characteristics and licensing objectives to actual
license outcomes. As dependent variables, we
consider four of the five outcomes considered in
Section 6: royalties, sponsored research, patents
and licenses executed. Inventions commercialized
are excluded since there are no measures available. Because of the long lags that often occur
between the application and issuance of patents,
we use new applications as our outcome measure
for patents rather than patents issued. Further,
new patent applications are a better measure of a
university’s interests in patents.
Data on the numbers of new patent applications, licenses executed and the amounts of royalties and sponsored research tied to a license are
from the AUTM surveys ŽAUTM, various years.
for the years 1994᎐96. We use average values
over these years. For royalties, we use license
income net of income paid to other institutions
and inclusive of reimbursed legal fees. For sponsored research, we also consider the frequency, as
reported in our survey, of license agreements
which include sponsored research. Data for this
measure are responses to a question as to how

often their license agreements included sponsored research. Possible responses were ‘‘almost
always,’’ ‘‘often,’’ ‘‘sometimes,’’ ‘‘rarely’’ and
‘‘never.’’ Only two TTO’s responded ‘‘never,’’ so
that we aggregate the ‘‘never’’ and ‘‘rarely’’ responses to a single category.
Independent variables in the analysis are the
importance the TTO attaches to the outcome, the
types of inventions produced by the faculty and
some measureŽs. of the size of the university’s
licensing operation andror potential. With the
exception of indicator variables, we use the logs
of the dependent and independent variables. For
all models except the frequency of sponsored
research, we use ordinary least squares with heteroscedastic robust standard errors. An ordered
probit regression is used to estimate the model
based on the frequency of sponsored research.
Licenses
For licenses executed, we include two ‘‘size’’ variables: the number of disclosures ŽINVDIS. and
the number of licensing professionals ŽTTOSIZE..
The greater the number of disclosures made to
the TTO, the greater the potential for executed
licenses. The greater the number of licensing
professionals, the more attention that can be paid
to each disclosure. A number of TTO professionals indicated to us that they did not have sufficient staff in their offices to adequately market all
technologies that were disclosed.
Recall from Section 6 that in indicating the
importance of outcomes, respondents were asked
to indicate whether an objective was ‘‘not very
important,’’ ‘‘moderately important’’ and ‘‘extremely important.’’ Based on the response, we

<-----Page 8----->A Sur¨ ey of Major U.S. Uni¨ ersities

form two indicator variables. For licenses, TTOEVAL 1 is set to one if the TTO indicates that
licenses are ‘‘not very important’’ Žzero, otherwise. and TTOEVAL 2 is set to one if the TTO
indicates ‘‘moderately important’’ Žzero, otherwise..
To capture the types of inventions in a university, we include measures of stage of development, the quality of the faculty, as well as whether
the university has a medical school. With regard
to the number of licenses executed, we expect a
negative relationship between the stage of development and the likelihood of license. Thus we
include as regressors the percentage of licensed
disclosures that were only ‘‘Proof of concept
but no prototype’’ ŽPROOF. and the percentage where there was a ‘‘Prototype available but
only lab scale Žfurther development needed.’’
ŽPTYPE.. Inventions in either state PROOF or
PTYPE are considered as ‘‘early stage,’’ with
PROOF being earlier than PTYPE. Note that we
are using the percentage of licensed disclosures in
these stages, whereas the percentage of all disclosures in these stages would be preferable; however, we did not collect that information.
Previous studies have found that the presence
of a medical school is related to productivity
measures of university licensing Žsee Thursby and
Kemp Ž2000. and Thursby and Thursby Ž2000a...
It is not clear whether this presence influences
outcomes via different preferences of medical
school faculty ¨ ersus other faculty or via generally
different characteristics of medical technologies.
In this analysis, the preferences of the TTO are
held constant Žand presumably are related to the
preferences of the faculty., so that the presence
or absence of a medical school ŽMEDSCHLs 1 if
there is a medical school, 0 otherwise. is included
here to account for possible differences in types
of technologies and their marketability.
The academic quality of the faculty ŽQUAL. is
included since different quality of faculties may
result in different invention characteristics Žstage
of development, novelty, etc... As our measure of
quality, we use the 1993 National Research Council’s ŽNRC 1995. survey results regarding the academic quality of Ph.D. granting departments. One
problem with this measure is that it considers
only the quality of Ph.D. granting departments.
However, apart from medical schools, it is plausi-

67

ble that substantial research programs are difficult to sustain in the sciences and engineering
without Ph.D. students. Thus with the exception
of medical schools, the quality of Ph.D. granting
departments in the engineering and sciences
should reflect the quality of the departments from
which disclosures emanate. We use a weighted
average of the department quality scores where
the weights are faculty size. Note that the NRC
rankings do not include all institutions, hence
some of our respondents must be excluded. The
quality scores range from 0 to 5 where 5 indicates
a distinguished department.
We have omitted a number of characteristics
of university offices that one might expect to be
related to outcomes. For example, we omit publicrprivate status, the portion of the TTO’s operating expenses that derive from licenses and the
background of the TTO. We do so, not because
we believe they are unimportant but because we
expect them to influence outcomes via their influence on the evaluation the TTO places on different objectives.
Royalties
Licenses are modelled as functions of several size
regressors. Royalties, on the other hand, are not
expected to be related to the number of licensing
professionals in the TTO or to the number of
invention disclosures. Rather, the only size variable that we expect might be related to royalties
is the number of licenses executed ŽLICENSES..
We include the importance the TTO attaches to
royalties. Only one TTO indicated that royalties
were ‘‘not very important’’ so we aggregate responses to two groups: ‘‘extremely important’’ and
‘‘other.’’ TTOEVAL 2 is set to one if the TTO
indicates ‘‘other’’ Žzero, otherwise.. Characteristics of inventions, for the reasons outlined above
for licenses executed, can influence their market
acceptance so that we also include PROOF,
PTYPE, MEDSCHL and QUAL.
Patents
The measure of patents we use is the number of
new patent applications, and our only measure of
size for patents is the number of inventions disclosed ŽINVDIS.. For inventions that are only a
proof of concept, it may be difficult to convince

<-----Page 9----->68

Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby

the patent office of the ‘‘utility’’ of the invention.
Similarly, inventions that are no more than a lab
scale prototype may not work when scaled up.
Thus we might expect our measures of stage of
development to be negatively related to the patent
outcome. Further, universities often seek patent
protection only when commercial potential is
clear, and this is often not the case for early stage
technologies. Note that the measure of stage of
development appropriate to patenting is the stage
of development of disclosures; however, PROOF
and PTYPE are the fraction of licensed inventions in these stages.
Faculty quality, QUAL, is included since higher
quality faculties are expected, in general, to produce more novel inventions. The importance attached by the TTO to patents is included. TTOEVAL 1 is set equal to one if the TTO responded
that patents are ‘‘not very important’’ Žzero, otherwise., and TTOEVAL 2 is set to one if the
TTO indicated that patents are ‘‘moderately important’’ Žzero, otherwise..
Sponsored research
Sponsored research is measured both as the
amount of sponsored research tied to a license
ŽSPONRES. and the frequency, as reported by
the TTO, that sponsored research is included in
a license agreement ŽSPONFREQ.. For SPONFREQ we assign 3 to the response ‘‘almost always,’’ 2 to ‘‘often,’’ 1 to ‘‘sometimes’’ and 0 to

‘‘rarely’’ or ‘‘never.’’ In an ordered probit model
the actual values assigned do not matter so long
as they properly reflect the ordinal ranking. Since
sponsored research tied to a license is often used
to support further development of the invention
licensed, we include the stages of development
PROOF and PTYPE. We also include QUAL
and measures of the valuation the TTO places on
sponsored research. TTOEVAL 1 is set equal to
one if the TTO responded that sponsored research is ‘‘not very important’’ Žzero, otherwise.,
and TTOEVAL 2 is set to one if the TTO
indicated ‘‘moderately important’’ Žzero otherwise.. A size variable ŽLICENSES. is used for
SPONRES.
Results
Results for the five regressions are in Table VI.
Since ordered probit coefficients are difficult to
interpret, we consider first the four least squares
regressions dealing with numbers of licenses and
new patent applications and amounts of royalties
and sponsored research funds. We then turn to
the ordered probit results for SPONFREQ. Recall that we are using logs of all variables except
the indicator variables, so that the coefficients of
the least squares regressions are elasticities.
The R2 in several of the equations is quite
high Žfor example, LICENSES has an R2 of 0.84..
This is, however, an artifact of including the ‘‘size’’
regressors TTOSIZE, LICENSES and INVDIS.

Note that each of these size regressors is significantly different from zero and each is positive Žas
they are expected to be.. For the patents and
sponsored research equations, only the size variables ŽINVDIS and LICENSES, respectively. are
significantly different from zero. The elasticities
of patents with respect to disclosures and sponsored research with respect to licenses are each
close to one, and, further, they are not significantly different from one. Patents and sponsored
research appear to grow nearly ‘‘lock-step’’ with
disclosures and licenses, respectively.
In the licenses executed equation, only TTOSIZE, INVDIS and MEDSCHL are significantly
different from zero and each is positive. The
MEDSCHL result is expected given the generally
greater marketability of medical inventions Žsee,
for example, Thursby and Kemp Ž2000..; however,
this does not carry over to royalties as MEDSCHL is not significant in that regression. Also
not surprising is the result that larger TTOs execute more licenses and more inventions disclosures lead to more inventions. Below we consider
the significance of the small elasticity of licenses
with respect to disclosures.
In the royalty equation, PTYPE, QUAL and
LICENSES are each positive and significantly
different from zero while PROOF is negative and
significant. Earlier we noted that royalties are
hard to define for early stage technologies given
the inherent uncertainty about their ultimate
commercial viability. That fact appears to manifest itself in our findings for royalties with respect

to PROOF and PTYPE. The greater the percent
of licenses executed in the earliest stage of development ŽPROOF. the lower are royalties, and
royalties grow as the percent of licenses in the
next stage of development ŽPTYPE. increases.
Finally, the positive, significant coefficient of
QUAL suggests that higher quality faculty tend to
produce inventions with greater commercial viability Žperhaps because of novelty..
The elasticities of licenses with respect to invention disclosures and royalties with respect to
licenses are each smaller than one. It is also the
case that they are significantly smaller than one
Žat a 10% level in the license equation and a 5%
level in the royalty equation.. Thursby and
Thursby Ž2000a. find results which suggest that
universities are delving more deeply into the
available pool of inventions so that there is declining commercial appeal for the marginal disclosure. Our finding that the elasticities of licenses with respect to invention disclosures and
royalties with respect to licenses each are less
than one reinforces the Thursby and Thursby
result. If there is declining commercial appeal of
the marginal disclosure then the likelihood of
finding a licensee should be declining and this
would result in an elasticity smaller than one. The
same point holds for royalties and licenses.
Table VI gives the ordered probit coefficients
for the sponsored research frequency equation
Žthat is, the equation explaining the frequency
with which licenses include sponsored research ..
Ordered probit coefficients are difficult to interpret, so we also provide in Table VII the conditional probabilities and elasticities associated with
the ordered probit results. Recall that the dependent variable SPONFREQ is set equal to 3 if the
TTO responded that sponsored research is included in licenses ‘‘almost always,’’ 2 if they responded ‘‘often,’’ 1 if they responded ‘‘sometimes’’
and 0 if they responded ‘‘rarely’’ or ‘‘never.’’ To
interpret ordered probit coefficients we need to
calculate the effects of changes in regressors on
changes in the probability of observing different
values of SPONFREQ. For example, a positive,
significant coefficient only indicates that increases in the independent variable will increase
the probability of observing a score of 3 and will
decrease the probability of a 0. By themselves, the
coefficient estimates do not reveal either the di-

<-----Page 11----->70

Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby

rection of effects on observing scores of 1 or 2 or
the magnitude of the probability of observing a
particular score. For a more meaningful understanding of the coefficients we substitute them
into the probability model and calculate elasticities for the continuous regressors and for the
discrete regressors we calculate probabilities of
each of the four frequencies conditional on each
possible value of the discrete regressors.
The SPONFREQ equation is the only one in
which the TTO’s evaluation of an outcome is
significant. If the TTO views sponsored research
as ‘‘not very important,’’ then the probability that
a license will include sponsored research is lower
than if the TTO values sponsored research more
highly. However, there is not a significant difference between a TTO valuation of ‘‘moderately
important’’ and ‘‘extremely important.’’ In the
first column of the first panel of Table VII the
value 0.704 is the probability that a university will
rarely or never include sponsored research in a
license agreement conditional on their valuation
of sponsored research to be ‘‘not important.’’ If
the TTO values sponsored research as either
moderately or extremely important the probability of ‘‘rarely or never’’ is less than 0.08. The
probability of ‘‘sometimes’’ having sponsored research in a license is roughly similar regardless of
the TTO’s valuation of sponsored research. When
the TTO values sponsored research moderately
or extremely important the probability rises to
greater than 0.5 that a license agreement will
include sponsored research often.
Both PROOF and PTYPE are significantly
different from zero, with the former having a
positive effect and the latter a negative effect on
the frequency of sponsored research. This result
is expected, as was the relation between stage of
development and royalties. The earlier the stage
of development, the more likely is sponsored research to support further development and the
less likely are royalties. In the royalty equation,
we found the expected result of increasing royalties as the stage of development increased. In the
sponsored research frequency equation, we also
find the expected result that the earlier the stage
of development of inventions the more likely it is
that sponsored research will appear in a license;
in general, such sponsored research would be for
further development of the technology. The sec-

ond panel of Table VII gives the elasticities of
the probability of a license including sponsored
research with respect to PROOF and PTYPE.
For example, the value y2.554 indicates that a
1% increase in PROOF will lead to a 2.554% fall
in the probability of rarely or never having a
license include sponsored research.
Finally, universities with higher quality faculty
are less likely to include sponsored research in a
license; recall that we also find that such universities are more likely to have greater amounts of
royalty income. One hypothesis that explains these
results is that higher quality faculty have less
difficulty, in general, obtaining sponsored research funds so that licenses are used more to
generate income.
8. Conclusion
This paper describes the results of our survey of
TTOs at 62 major research universities. Roughly
two-thirds of the respondents were public universities, and more than half of those were land-grant
institutions. For fiscal year 1996 each of these
received, on average, about $150 million in federally sponsored research funds and earned $4 million in income. Patentable inventions are typically
owned by the university, though the inventor’s
share of license income averages 40%, and inventors often have control over an even larger share.
Medical schools disclose the most inventions,
though engineering and science schools disclose
nearly as many. Most inventions which evolve
from university research are disclosed at a very
early stage of development, and so have generally
uncertain market potential and require substantial additional development before they can be
brought to the market Žif they ever make it that
far..
University objectives in the licensing process
are diverse. The most important objective to the
TTO is royalties and fees generated, but other
objectives are important. Licenses executed almost always include royalties and up-front fees,
often include sponsored research, but less frequently include equity shares in the licensee.
Finally, given this information, we analyzed the
relationship between licensing outcomes and both
the objectives of the TTO and characteristics of
the new technologies. It appears that patent ap-

<-----Page 12----->A Sur¨ ey of Major U.S. Uni¨ ersities

plications grow on a one-to-one basis with disclosures, while sponsored research grows similarly
with licenses executed. More licenses are executed at universities with large TTOs and medical
schools. Royalties generated are typically larger
the higher the quality of the faculty and the
higher the fraction of licenses that are executed
at latter stages of development. Sponsored research is more likely to be included in a license
agreement if the new technology is at an early
stage of development or if the TTO values it as
important. We also find evidence that, at the
margin, additional disclosures generate smaller
percentage increases in licenses, and those increases in licenses generate smaller percentage
increases in royalties. That is, TTOs generally
have been effective at tapping the pool of available technologies in their universities.

Notes
1. The bulk of this literature has focused either on the role
of patents and publications in the transfer process Žsee Adams,
1990; Henderson, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg, 1998; and Jaffe,
Trajtenberg, and Henderson, 1993. or on consulting, sponsored research or institutional ties Žsee Cohen et al., 1998;
Mansfield, 1995; and Zucker, Darby and Armstrong, 1998;
and Zucker, Darby and Brewer, 1998..
2. For 26% of our sample it is university policy that the
inventor can direct department, university andror TTO shares.
For other universities, it is department policies which determine whether the inventor can direct department shares.
