e draw on diverse data sets to compare the institutional organization of upstream life
science research across the United States and Europe. Understanding cross-national
differences in the organization of innovative labor in the life sciences requires attention to
the structure and evolution of biomedical networks involving public research organizations
(universities, government laboratories, nonproﬁt research institutes, and research hospitals),
science-based biotechnology ﬁrms, and multinational pharmaceutical corporations. We use
network visualization methods and correspondence analyses to demonstrate that innovative research in biomedicine has its origins in regional clusters in the United States and in
European nations. But the scientiﬁc and organizational composition of these regions varies
in consequential ways. In the United States, public research organizations and small ﬁrms
conduct R&D across multiple therapeutic areas and stages of the development process. Ties
within and across these regions link small ﬁrms and diverse public institutions, contributing
to the development of a robust national network. In contrast, the European story is one of
regional specialization with a less diverse group of public research organizations working
in a smaller number of therapeutic areas. European institutes develop local connections to
small ﬁrms working on similar scientiﬁc problems, while cross-national linkages of European regional clusters typically involve large pharmaceutical corporations. We show that the
roles of large and small ﬁrms differ in the United States and Europe, arguing that the greater
heterogeneity of the U.S. system is based on much closer integration of basic science and
clinical development.

Introduction

Universities in the United States and Europe are often
compared with respect to their divergent levels of
involvement in the private economy. The U.S. university system, with its mix of both public and private institutions, has long played a signiﬁcant role

in conducting research that contributes to technological development and industrial performance (Geiger
1988, Rosenberg and Nelson 1994). Historically, this
“knowledge plus” orientation, in which high-quality
public and academic research tends to be driven
by “joint goals of understanding and use” (Stokes

1997, p. 15) was contrasted to the European scene,
where universities were believed to contribute more
to knowledge for its own sake and to the preservation
of distinctive national cultures (Ben-David 1977).
Over the past decade, the development of a number
of key science and technology-based industries—most
notably information and communication technologies, and biotechnology—has helped spark economic
growth. The United States has broad commercial leadership in a number of these new areas, and commentators suggest that U.S. universities and research
institutes played a signiﬁcant role in this process
(Mowery and Nelson 1999, Mowery et al. 2001).
The diverse interfaces between U.S. research universities and the private sector have been widely documented (Link 1999, Mowery 1999). Patenting by
U.S. universities increased nearly sevenfold over the
period 1976–1998 (Owen-Smith 2000) and licensing
revenues from the sale of intellectual property have
grown briskly as well. The science-based start-up ﬁrm
has been the cornerstone of the commercial ﬁeld of
biotechnology, with university researchers playing a
signiﬁcant role as founders, consultants, and members
of scientiﬁc advisory boards.
In contrast, industry-university relations in Europe
have lagged behind, in part because of legal prohibitions in some countries against faculty collaboration with commercial entities and cultural predispositions against academic involvement with commerce.
Since the late 1980s, however, European attention has
shifted to technology policy and academic technology
transfer (Howells and McKinlay 1999). In a climate
of strong anxiety about European Union competitiveness in science-based industries, programs developed
following the Single European Act of 19871 encourage
matches between universities and ﬁrms, placing particular emphasis on quick delivery of tangible commercial results (Peterson and Sharp 1998).
Strong contrasts exist between European and U.S.
research infrastructures, however. Consider, as an
illustration, differences in university organization and

governance between the United States and Germany.
The U.S. system is highly decentralized. Even public
universities rely on diverse funding sources, including state and national governments, foundations and
corporate supporters, tuition revenues, and alumni
gifts. Private universities, especially elite ones, are
also supported by generous endowments. Financing is considerably more centralized within European
nations, and this centralization entails more hierarchical control. Faculty members in the United States
have much more research independence at early
career stages, and academic scientists frequently
move between universities in an effort to better their
labor market position. In France and elsewhere on the
continent, there is much less autonomy and mobility
for younger scientists (Gittelman 2000). In addition,
blurring boundaries between basic and goal-oriented
research and increased competition for research support and funding enable greater mixing of disciplines
in the United States (Galambos and Sturchio 1998,
Morange 1998). In Germany, a number of the highly
prestigious Max Planck institutes are organized hierarchically around a single ﬁeld, such as biochemistry,
genetics, or immunology. Elite research institutes in
the United States, such as Cold Spring Harbor, Salk,
or Scripps, routinely bring together faculty from multiple disciplines.
Against this background, we undertake a broad
comparison of linkages between research universities,
public research institutes and the private sector in the
ﬁeld of the life sciences and analyze how differences
in the pattern of these relationships have shaped the
development of biotechnology in the United States
and Europe. The explosion of knowledge in molecular biology and genetics has generated a wide range
of new medical opportunities. Because the relevant
scientiﬁc knowledge and organizational skills are
broadly dispersed, no single organization has been
able to internally master and control all the competencies required to develop a new medicine (Powell
et al. 1996, Pammolli et al. 2000, Orsenigo et al.
2000). Biomedicine, then, is characterized by extensive
reliance on collaboration among many parties, including universities, research institutes, new biotechnology ﬁrms, and mature pharmaceutical and chemical
corporations (Arora and Gambardella 1994, Lerner
25

<-----Page 2----->OWEN-SMITH, RICCABONI, PAMMOLLI, AND POWELL
U.S. and European University-Industry Relations in the Life Sciences

and Merges 1998, Stuart et al. 1999, Arora et al. 2000).
These varied combinations of organizations afford us
the opportunity to analyze cross-national differences
in the roles these diverse organizations play in the
process by which biomedical research moves from
academic laboratories into clinical development.
In §2, we sketch the institutional terrains in Europe
and the United States that have shaped the division
of labor in biomedical innovation. The research systems in the United States and Europe are organized
in qualitatively different ways, hence any comparison must be sensitive to variation on multiple dimensions. We use the methods of correspondence analysis and large-scale network analysis to capture these
systemic differences. Methods and data sources are
discussed in §3. In §4, we present the comparative
analyses, beginning with relational data on collaborative R&D projects. We look at R&D projects that were
originated by public research organizations (PRO),2
and subsequently developed by an array of different types of organizations. The distribution shows
U.S.-European variation, as well as numerous crossnational linkages. To better understand these linkages,
we examine the position of countries in an international network of collaborative R&D projects. We then
view these national patterns more closely through an
assessment of patent co-assignment relationships. We
ﬁnd, again, strong national-level patterns. We analyze these national-level characteristics by looking at
the focus of R&D at leading research organizations
in Europe and the United States, matching patenting activity with therapeutic categories. These analyses point out the heterogeneity of the U.S. system,
on both scientiﬁc and organizational dimensions. We
examine this heterogeneity by mapping the evolution
of interorganizational ties in the United States at the
regional level. We conclude our analyses with a ﬁnegrained view of the Boston area, one of the leading
centers for biotechnology in the United States.
We assess the implications of our analyses in §5,
stressing the twin importance of integrative capacity (i.e., the ability to move back and forth from
2
We deﬁne PRO as any government research laboratory, public
or private university, or nonproﬁt or public research hospital or
institute.

26

basic research to clinical development) and relational
capability (i.e., the ability to collaborate with diverse
kinds of organizations). We conclude by noting that
while many analyses of the biomedical systems in
the United States and Europe highlight differences
in ﬁnancial and labor markets and note key policy
differences (for a review, see Gambardella 2000), we
stress fundamental variation in the organization of the
upstream R&D process.

2.

Trajectories of Development in
the United States and Europe

The canonical explanation for differences in the rate
of development of U.S. and European biomedicine
is straightforward, emphasizing ﬁrst-mover advantage in the growth of small, research-intensive U.S.
biotechnology ﬁrms. Along with the biotech boom,
emphasis has been placed on the evolution of
supporting institutions—ranging from federal policy
initiatives (e.g., the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act) to the availability of venture capital, intellectual property (IP)
law ﬁrms, and university technology transfer. We
think this story is accurate, but incomplete. We focus,
in contrast, on the upstream division of innovative
labor. We highlight the importance of the underlying
science and the diversity of organizations involved
in R&D activities. Using data on public-private R&D
relationships, we demonstrate that there are very different constellations of players in R&D networks in
Europe and the United States, and that these participants are engaged in different kinds of research and
clinical activities. The contrasting stories are signiﬁcant because our argument suggests that while legal
and ﬁnancial reforms and the availability of venture
capital are necessary, these elements alone may not be
sufﬁcient to generate dense linkages between public
research organizations and industry.
To foreshadow our argument, the United States
is characterized by relationships between U.S. public research organizations and ﬁrms located in dense
regional clusters that span therapeutic areas, cross
multiple stages of the development process, and
involve diverse collaborators. In contrast, European
innovative networks are characterized by sparser,
more specialized relationships among a more limited

set of organizational participants located in national
clusters. Both U.S. and European networks are geographically clustered, then, but in quite different fashions. From these disparate starting points, European
and U.S. innovative networks branch out in divergent
ways.
The science underlying biotechnology was developed in university and government laboratories.
The leading centers of research in the new molecular biology were dispersed widely throughout
advanced industrial nations.3 Initial technological
breakthroughs—most notably Herbert Boyer and
Stanley Cohen’s discovery of recombinant DNA
methods and George Köhler and Cesar Milstein’s cell
fusion technology to create monoclonal antibodies—
occurred in Californian and British universities. But
from the outset, U.S. universities and academic scientists actively worked to help create the biotechnology industry and reap rewards from their involvement (Liebeskind et al. 1996, Zucker et al. 1997,
Mowery et al. 2001). Consequently, small sciencebased ﬁrms were ﬁrst located in close proximity
to key universities and research institutes. In time,
established pharmaceutical companies (EPCs) were
also attracted to the ﬁeld, initially collaborating with
biotech ﬁrms in research partnerships and providing a set of downstream skills that were lacking in
the R&D-intensive startups. Eventually, the considerable promise of biotechnology led nearly every EPC
to develop, with varying degrees of success, both
in-house capacity in the new science and a wide
portfolio of alliances with small biotech ﬁrms (Arora
and Gambardella 1990, Gambardella 1995, Henderson
et al. 1999).
The early development of dedicated biotech ﬁrms
(DBFs) created an initial advantage for the United
States in biotechnology, as close contact between DBFs
and universities became commonplace by the mid1980s. Important differences in the nature and level of
support for academic life science research have also

played a key role in shaping the comparative advantage of the U.S. system (Gambardella et al. 2000).4
The structure of the research system and the strategies
pursued by funding agencies are crucially important.
In the United States, substantial R&D monies have
been administered through the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), which has supported signiﬁcant
interaction between the producers of fundamental
biological knowledge and those involved in clinical
research and drug development at public research
centers and universities. Moreover, the U.S. biomedical research system is characterized by numerous
alternative sources of support, with selection mechanisms that complement the NIH and act according to
different principles (Stokes 1997). These varied funding sources permit diversity to be explored.
In Europe, funding has tended to be administered at the national level, with strongly differentiated approaches apparent across countries. European
funding patterns may have hindered the development
of a critical mass, especially in smaller countries. In
many cases, resources have either been spread among
a large number of “small” laboratories, or they have
been excessively concentrated in the one or two centers of excellence. Support coming from the various
European-wide programs has only partially changed
the situation. In addition, research funds are much
less likely to support integration between basic science and clinical development.
European biomedical research has also been considerably less integrated with teaching. The relevance
of the research-teaching nexus in fostering highquality scientiﬁc research and integrating academic
and industrial science should not be understated. In
particular, the diffusion of molecular biology into general training in many European countries is a relatively recent phenomenon. As compared to the United
States, molecular biology research has tended to be
conﬁned to highly specialized university and research
institute laboratories (Morange 1998). Particularly
in Continental Europe, policies have been targeted
mainly to creating speciﬁc organizational devices to

Pavitt (2000) estimates that the resources devoted to academic
research in the life sciences in the United States are 50% larger than
in Europe.

manage technology transfer, such as science and technology parks. These intermediary institutions may
even increase the distance between universities and
industry by introducing an additional layer to the
relationship. We argue that these institutional differences in funding, and the relationships among
research, clinical work, and teaching, shape the structure of university-industry R&D networks in the
United States and Europe.
Partly as a consequence of the institutional differences sketched above, the founding of new biotechnology companies in Europe was more difﬁcult. Rates
of formation of start-ups are strongly correlated with
the strength of university and public research institutes in the underlying science (Zucker et al. 1997). In
the absence of small local ﬁrms, the large European
companies turned to small American partners to tap
new competencies as they struggled to catch up.
Given the head start and faster rates of technological development in the United States, European
start-ups may have been pre-empted by American
ﬁrms. Moreover, the more dominant large European
pharmaceutical ﬁrms have had a pronounced effect
on the development of European R&D networks, as
these organizations serve a “clearing-house” function
for the development of more specialized innovations
from national research clusters.

Data and Methods

Analyzing cross-national differences in research funding, organization, and practice, as well as differential
integration across R&D, clinical activity, and teaching is most effectively accomplished with methods
that visually represent these patterns of relationships.
We are less interested in the attributes of individual research organizations and much more concerned
with the linkages that structure innovation systems.
Hence we utilize methods that capture these relational
features graphically. We use correspondence analysis and graph-drawing techniques to examine key
characteristics of life science knowledge networks.
Correspondence analysis is an analytical technique
for studying the canonical correlations between two
(or more) sets of categorical variables.5 We perform
5

For illustration, see Greenacre (1984, 1993).

28

correspondence analyses to visually represent correlations among therapeutic patent classiﬁcations and
public research organization assignees in a common
two-dimensional space.
We adopt a general analytical technique based on
the theory of random ﬁelds (Ising 1925, Guyon 1994)
to graphically display collaborative networks at the
national, cross-national, and organizational level.6
Speciﬁcally, we applied the Fruchterman-Reingold
(FR) algorithm (1991) to simulate our network of
collaborations as a system of interacting particles
with repelling forces u v x = c12 /dxu  xv  between
every pair of nodes u v ∈ V , and additional attracting forces u v x = dxu  xv 2 /c1 , which are in place
only between connected nodes, where dxu  xv  is the
Euclidean distance of locations xu and xv of nodes
u

and v, respectively. The parameter c1 is set to c2 A/n,
where A is the desired layout area, n is the number
of nodes, and c2 is an experimentally chosen constant.
The FR algorithm aims to minimize the force on each
node, which is equivalent to minimizing the energy,
U , of the overall random ﬁeld:


au v x − u v x if nodes u and v are
connected
Uu v x =


u v x
otherwise
More precisely, the FR algorithm is designed to ﬁnd
a stable conﬁguration corresponding to a local minimum. To prevent the algorithm from resting in suboptimal local outcomes and to improve the ﬁt of the
ﬁnal conﬁguration, we run the algorithm with several
randomly chosen initial layouts. At the end, the drawings we present to illustrate our argument capture not
only the pattern and density of collaborative activity, but also are a meaningful indicator of the extent
to which such collaborations create actual clusters of
tightly connected partners.

The theory of random ﬁelds provides a uniﬁed theoretical framework to cope with large systems of interacting agents in the natural and social sciences. The reader interested in the relationship between the theory of random ﬁeld and graph-drawing techniques is referred to Brandes and Wagner (1997), Guyon (1994), and
Winkler (1995). A software package for large network analysis is
available online at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek.
Pajek has been used to analyze multiple types of large networks
(Batagelj and Mrvar 2000, Albert et al. 2000).

We draw on several complementary data sets to
analyze European and U.S. research organizationindustry innovation networks for the period spanning
1988–1999. Two patent data sets and two research
collaboration data sets form the core of our analyses. The databases, referred to in the tables and ﬁgures as “U.S. Biomedicine,” developed by Powell and
Kenneth Koput and by Owen-Smith, focus primarily on the United States. In their examination of the
role research universities play in the commercial ﬁeld
of the life sciences, they ﬁnd 1,026 linkages between
public research organizations and dedicated biotech
ﬁrms over the 12-year period. For each relationship,
data are available on the purpose of the afﬁliation, its
duration, and the identities of the participants. These
relationships represent formal contractual ties established between ﬁrms or through the auspices of the
United States Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce. The larger
database from which these relationships are extracted
focuses on dedicated biotechnology ﬁrms (Powell and
Koput) and Research One (R1) universities as designated by the Carnegie Foundation classiﬁcation system (Owen-Smith 2000). Both databases have been
used extensively in previous research (Powell et al.
1996, Powell et al. 1999, Owen-Smith 2000, 2001).7
The biotech database covers independently operated, proﬁt-seeking entities involved in human therapeutic and diagnostic applications of biotechnology.8
The sample includes 482 ﬁrms, 180 of which exist in
all years over the period 1988–1999. There were 229
entrants during the period, and 91 exits overall. The

These data focus on dedicated human biotechnology ﬁrms. Companies involved in veterinary and agricultural biotech, which draw
on different scientiﬁc capabilities and operate in a much different regulatory climate, are omitted. We also exclude companies
that are wholly owned subsidiaries of pharmaceutical and chemical corporations. We do, however, include biotech companies that
have minority or majority investments in them by other ﬁrms, so
long as the company is independently traded on the stock market. Our rationale for excluding both biotech subsidiaries and large
diversiﬁed corporations is that the former do not make decisions
autonomously and biotechnology may represent only a small portion of the latter’s activities.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

database, like the industry, is largely centered in the
United States, although in recent years there has been
signiﬁcant expansion in Europe. In 1999, 80% of the
companies were located in the United States, whereas
10% made their homes in Europe. The U.S. university
database focuses on the role that research-intensive
campuses have played in biotechnology through the
speciﬁc lens of patent co-assignment. Using a data
set coded from bibliographic information drawn from
patents assigned to 89 R1 universities from 1976–1998,
we identiﬁed 181 co-assigned pharmaceutical patents
that were jointly owned by R1 universities and dedicated biotech ﬁrms or non-university research institutes and hospitals.9
Pammolli and Riccaboni have developed two comprehensive data sets with extensive coverage of
Europe and the United States. The Pharmaceutical
Industry Database (referred to as PHID) developed
at the University of Siena covers 4,358 collaborative
R&D projects among industrial and nonindustrial
sources.10 For each R&D project, the PHID database
distinguishes the organization that originated a new
pharmacologically active compound from the organization(s) that licensed that patent for further
development. In addition to this originator-developer
distinction, each project is classiﬁed according to
the Anatomic Therapeutic Classiﬁcation (ATC), which
identiﬁes pharmacological actions and biological
targets.11
9
To accomplish this we use a recent Ofﬁce of Technology Assessment and Forecasting crosswalk between United States Patent
Ofﬁce subject area classiﬁcations and three-digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation product codes. Patent co-assignment represents
shared ownership of intellectual property and, as such, indicates a
particularly close and potentially consequential form of interorganizational collaboration. Co-assignment limits each partner’s ability
to unilaterally appropriate rents from intellectual property. Thus, it
is not a relationship that organizations (especially for-proﬁt organizations) enter into lightly. Co-assignment is common in cases where
patents have multiple inventors who are employed by different
organizations.
10

For further details about the PHID, see Riccaboni (2000, pp. 9–11
and 31–33).

11

The ATC classiﬁcation has been developed and maintained since
1971 by the European Pharmaceutical Marketing Research Association. The three-digit ATC designation is a widely accepted standard
for classifying pharmaceutical products and is used by anti-trust
associations around the globe.

29

<-----Page 6----->OWEN-SMITH, RICCABONI, PAMMOLLI, AND POWELL
U.S. and European University-Industry Relations in the Life Sciences

The second database, referred to in the tables as
“Patents,” draws on 8,031 patents for therapeutically
useful compounds or processes issued by major world
patent ofﬁces (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, European, and the Patent Cooperation Treaty legal ofﬁce) and assigned to the 98 most
proliﬁc nonindustrial research organizations worldwide.12 These 98 institutions represent more than 70%
of all nonindustrial patents in this sample. Thus, there
is a natural cutoff point at 98, as the remainder of
the distribution is very widely dispersed across hundreds of organizations. These patents were also coded
according to the same pharmacological classiﬁcation
used for R&D projects.
Taken together, these four data sources permit us
to develop a comprehensive and novel view of patent
co-assignment and collaborative networks involving
European and U.S. biotechnology ﬁrms, pharmaceutical corporations, and public research organizations.
Our data are broad in scope and involve thousands of
relationships among multiple types of organizations,
enabling us to map qualitative differences in publicprivate R&D networks in the life sciences.

Analyses: Cross-National
Networks and Organizational
Competencies in R&D

We begin by presenting data on R&D projects generated by PROs and developed collaboratively with

other organizations.13 We distinguish the roles of
originators and developers, with the former responsible for the underlying basic science, focusing on
the early stages of target identiﬁcation/validation
and drug discovery, and the latter handling downstream stages of R&D and subsequent manufacture
and/or marketing. We identify originators as the
institution that started the R&D project and, typically, held the relevant patent. Note that a variety of
organizations—PROs, DBFs, and EPCs—perform the
roles of developing, producing, and commercializing
new biomedical products.
As Table 1 indicates, the bulk of the collaborative
projects occurs within the United States, while a much
smaller number are carried out in Europe. We are
somewhat less interested in the scale of activity than
in what kind of organizations are involved. In the
United States, dedicated biotech ﬁrms do the lion’s
share of the development work (nearly 55%) on PROoriginated innovations. When a U.S. PRO turns to a
European partner, the large multinational corporation
is the dominant option. In Europe, there are real differences in collaboration within and across nations. In
local within-country collaborations, European PROs
turn to DBFs and other PROs. But when collaboration occurs across European countries, the EPCs again
become the dominant partner. When European PROs
reach across the Atlantic, U.S. DBFs are the primary
developers. The picture that emerges is one of very

In this article we focus only on the PROs as originators, and
do not examine cases where DBFs and EPCs are sources of new
research opportunities or cases where PROs were developers for
PRO originators.

different roles for small ﬁrms and large multinationals in Europe and the U.S. The large pharmaceuticals
are responsible for the bulk of cross-national collaborations in Europe, while the small biotechs are the key
developers in the U.S. We turn now to an in-depth
examination of these organizational differences.
Organizational Underpinnings
Figure 1 represents the R&D projects data graphically,
locating the position of nations in a global network.
In this ﬁgure the spatial position of the nodes represents the relative centrality of individual nations
in the international R&D project network. The size
of the nodes corresponds to the number of biomedical patents held by PROs in each nation. Thus,
node size reﬂects relative differences in the stock of
patented biomedical knowledge held by PROs in each
nation, and indicates the volume of innovations generated by each national research system. The numbers

Figure 1

associated with the lines are counts of the number of cross-national R&D agreements. For example, the close connection between the United States
and the United Kingdom represents 441 individual
R&D project ties between PROs and commercial entities. Figure 1 portrays several key characteristics of
the international biomedical R&D projects network,
reﬂecting relative national positions in terms of both
stocks and international ﬂows of knowledge.
Note the centrality and size of the American node.
The large and diverse public research system in the
United States dominates global patenting and is central in the cross-national project network. This centrality is reﬂected in the spatial location of the node

connections to otherwise isolated European nations
(e.g., the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, and Denmark),

resents a higher volume of individual R&D agreements than any of the cross-national ties between
other nations. Figure 1 clearly implies that the public
research organizations in the United States are structurally central and quantitatively dominant in crossnational R&D project networks.
The nationally aggregated picture presented in
Figure 1 does not tell the full story, however. R&D
projects and patented biomedical innovations stem
from the work of scientists and clinicians in organizations. Figure 2 examines the upstream collaborative
network among individual PROs to analyze relationships among organizations whose patenting activity
drives the size of the nodes in Figure 1. Figure 2 is
based on patent co-assignment networks among public research organizations. Each node is a university,
research institute, or hospital, and each tie represents
two or more patent co-assignments between the organizations. As was the case with Figure 1, the relative spatial position of nodes is a reﬂection of the
minimum-energy algorithm we employ using Pajek.
Several features stand out in this image.
Consider ﬁrst the regional and national clustering
of organizations that we highlight with dashed and
dotted lines. The tightly clustered French, German,
and British research organizations on the left side of
the ﬁgure and the densely connected U.S. regions in
the image’s upper right-hand quadrant are the result
of minimum-energy network drawing techniques and
not of arbitrary placement. In addition to demonstrating the coherence of national and regional R&D
systems, the patterns of patent co-assignment help
explain the causes of the U.S. dominance apparent
in Figure 1. Note the organizational homogeneity of
the French and German national clusters, which do
not include hospitals and have no identiﬁed universities.14 The United Kingdom has a somewhat higher
degree of organizational diversity, reﬂected by the
presence of both government and nonproﬁt research
and funding agencies. Contrast these relatively isolated and homogeneous national clusters with the
large and densely interconnected Boston region in the

upper quadrant of the ﬁgure. Boston is composed of
tight, repeated interconnections among a diverse set
of PROs. Elite universities (Harvard, MIT), research
institutes (the Dana-Farber Cancer Center), and hospitals (Brigham and Women’s and Massachusetts General) play central roles in innovative collaborations
both within Boston and across U.S. regions.
Closely knit regional networks such as those
found in Boston help account for the global centrality of American PROs. But connections across
U.S. regions (note, for instance, the ties between
Harvard, Stanford, and the UC system, connections
from Dana-Farber to the University of Chicago, and
from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to Duke University) and co-assignment ties linking geographically dispersed universities to the National Institutes
of Health illustrate a public research system that
also reaches across regions and organizational forms.
Recall that these relationships represent patent coassignments, a particularly close form of R&D collaboration. We argue that these systemic cross-national
variations in the organization of early-stage research
collaborations explain national differences in biomedical commercialization above and beyond variations
in policies or later-stage technology transfer infrastructures. Consequently, we expect the structural
clustering of European nations and U.S. regions, and
the consolidating effect of inter-regional ties in the
U.S., to result from characteristics of the science
underlying these patent co-assignment networks. To
consider this assertion, we turn to correspondence
analyses of the speciﬁc therapeutic areas covered by
public research institute patents in the United States
and Europe. As we use the term here, a therapeutic
class is one of 102 speciﬁc disease areas on which a
patented innovation focuses. Thus we can distinguish
both the scientiﬁc content and the speciﬁc target of
patented research in the United States and Europe.

output, correspondence analysis provides a graphical
representation in a chi-squared metric such that institutions with proﬁles close to the average are plotted
near the origin, while more specialized proﬁles are

Correspondence analysis allows us to deal simultaneously with
organizational and scientiﬁc proﬁles of the U.S. and European public research systems. For readers not familiar with dual scaling techniques, it may be worthwhile to notice that correspondence analysis
is essentially a variant of principle component analysis tailored to
categorical rather than continuous data (Hill 1974, Greenacre and
Hastie 1987, p. 437). As with principle component analysis, correspondence analysis does not provide cut-and-dried conclusions,
instead it is an explanatory technique that offers a framework for
interpretation (Greenacre 1993, p. 85).

of number of patents, while the lighter labels denote
therapeutic macro-classes. Institutions and therapeutic categories play dual roles, weighting organizational proﬁles and rescaling the dimensions of the
ﬁgures. Here again, the spatial relationships among
PROs and therapeutic classes are meaningful representations of quantitative relationships. Interpoint
distances are reﬂective of differences in institutional
therapeutic proﬁles. For example, if a given institution
holds the same number of patents for each therapeutic
category, then it will be centrally located. In contrast,
an institution specialized in one class will appear on
the periphery of the correspondence map.16
16

To allow the same interpretation for therapeutic classes in the
space deﬁned by research organizations, we rescaled organization scores as suggested in Carroll et al. (1986). As a result,
the plots in Figures 3 and 4 that report both institutions and

Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate that while research
is proceeding on substantively similar topics across
the continents, the division of organizational labor
that produces it varies greatly. Note the big differences in the types of core actors. In the European case (Figure 3) universities are underrepresented. Instead, research institutes such as France’s
Institute Pasteur and Germany’s Max Planck and
Max Delbruck centers play important roles. This centrality is not surprising, given the preeminent role
of these institutes in the history of molecular biology (Morange 1998). In contrast, Figure 4 reprises

innovation system are much more organizationally

diverse. Note the centrality of the U.S. government
(the National Institutes of Health complex), Johns
Hopkins University, and the University of California
System. But also observe the key presence of elite
research institutes such as Scripps and Salk, major
research hospitals and medical schools (Brigham and
Women’s, Massachusetts General, and Baylor College
of Medicine), as well as other top research universities
(MIT, Stanford, Pennsylvania, Duke, and Rockefeller).
The clear implication is that the universe of central
public research organizations is much more heterogeneous in the United States than in Europe.
Observe the relative dispersion of therapeutic
classes that appears in both Figures 3 and 4. For
Europe, Figure 3 indicates a fairly dispersed set
of therapeutic classes, suggesting that the organizations associated with them are specialized innovators
35

<-----Page 12----->OWEN-SMITH, RICCABONI, PAMMOLLI, AND POWELL
U.S. and European University-Industry Relations in the Life Sciences

whose patents focus on speciﬁc sets of therapies and
biological targets. In contrast, therapeutic classes are
not clearly separable in Figure 4, indicating that leading U.S. PROs hold patents that span multiple substantive areas. Finally, consider the co-location of therapeutic classes and public research organizations in
the two ﬁgures. Figure 3 highlights not only specialization by organizational form, but also national
specialization in areas of innovation. There are two
apparent clusters of research institutes and therapeutic classes. The French institutes on the left-hand
side of Figure 3 are located close to each other and
co-located on a distinctive set of therapeutic classes
relating primarily to infectious disease and AIDS
research. German research institutes, at the right-hand
side of the ﬁgure, are more involved with hereditary cardiovascular diseases. The more dispersed
and diverse British institutions, e.g., Cancer Research
Campaign (CRC), Medical Research Council (MRC),
and the British Technology Group (BT), are somewhat broader in focus but still cluster in therapeutic
classes largely related to cancer research. The greater
breadth of the British research system, and its higher
degree of diversity compared to France and Germany,
may explain its more central role in international
R&D networks (recall Figure 1). Figure 4, on the other
hand, tells a quite different story. In the U.S. national
innovation system, diverse public research institutions play the role of generalist innovators regardless of geographic location, though the prevalence
of Boston- and California-based research organizations in the core suggests the importance of regional
agglomeration.
These differences in the organization of science
are critical, suggesting that increases in scale alone
will not alter the focus of R&D efforts. Organizations typically engage in local search, and thus continue to patent in those areas in which they are most
skilled. In essence, then, we argue that one reason
for greater integration across and within U.S. regions
can be found in the scientiﬁc overlap among generalist patentors. Alterations in the scale of patenting
activity without corresponding shifts in this division
of labor will not make the European system resemble its American counterpart. Instead, we contend
36

that mere increases in scale might deepen specialization and heighten fragmentation among European
national research systems.
One key message of the correspondence analyses is
that national specialization in Europe falls along scientiﬁc lines. In the United States, there is abundant
regional clustering, but, unlike the European case,
agglomeration is not driven by scientiﬁc specialization. Points of excellence develop in both the United
States and European systems, but in Europe those
clusters are limited to narrower medical specialties
and speciﬁc nations. The U.S. has a very different proﬁle, characterized by diverse, substantively generalist research organizations connected both within and
across key regional clusters. To further understanding of the organization of the U.S. national system,
we turn to an analysis of its growth out of a few key
regional clusters.
A National System from Regional Origins
We have stressed the dual role of universities and
start-up ﬁrms in biotechnology’s origins. Here, we
present data that conﬁrm the co-location of universities, research institutes, and dedicated biotech
ﬁrms in a small number of geographic regions in
the United States. In 1988, 73% of all collaborations
between DBFs and PROs occurred in just six areas:
Boston, the New York metropolitan area, Seattle, San
Diego County, the Bay Area, and Texas (principally
Houston).17 This phenomenon has been attributed to
a range of intellectual, economic, and social factors.
Knowledge spillovers are clearly important, especially
when novel discoveries are involved. The availability of skilled labor and access to venture capital
17

Those six regions contain 14.6% (13) of the universities, 14.3% (24)
of the research institutes and hospitals, and 27.2% (131) of the DBFs
in our sample. Clearly the aggregate concentration of ties in clusters
is a function of their concentration in a handful of organizations.
We do not attempt to separate the effects of organizational and geographic concentration of ties here. Instead, we content ourselves
with noting their importance for a full understanding of regional
and industry development. We treat each of the clusters as coherent
units for the purposes of cross-national comparison, but we recognize that each area is itself a complex system of relationships with
a core and periphery and a distinctive evolutionary trajectory. The
same factors that we expect to affect industry development at the
national level also play out within regions.

are critical as well. Extensive social ties and reputational credibility catalyze further relationships, sustaining a process of increasing returns. But how do
initial locational advantages and rapid technological
development interact? In addition to institutional and
labor market differences, we argue that the structure
of scientiﬁc knowledge in biomedicine plays a key
role.
The ﬁeld of the life sciences has witnessed a rapid
expansion of knowledge that has taken the form of
a branching process, in which general hypotheses
have given rise to subhypotheses, and in turn to further inquiries (Orsenigo et al. 2001). The structure
of knowledge is hierarchical, highly cumulative, and,
in the industry’s early years, difﬁcult to appropriate without close contact with cutting edge academic
researchers. But discoveries that were considered revolutionary at the outset were soon incorporated into
the standard toolkit of laboratory practice. As the
skills became widely accessible and new transversal
technologies (e.g., genomics, combinatorial chemistry,
and high throughput screening) allowed for sophisticated production and screening of new molecular
structures absent contact with established research
centers, DBF dependence on prestigious university
researchers declined, and the central importance of
network connections to local partners waned.
We seek to explain how the evolution of the science has affected the network of collaborative relationships. Several possibilities can be sketched, with
different roles for various types of institutions. For
example, universities and ﬁrms that were ﬁrst movers
on the research frontier could continue their close ties
as the research moved into clinical development. But
as initial successes are achieved and publicized, many
other participants are attracted to the ﬁeld, both in
the United States and abroad. An alternative process
could involve the initial entrants as the carriers of
the ﬁeld, moving from co-localized relationships to
more distant linkages with other ﬁrms and universities. This process might be driven by a production
logic, in which diffusion occurs with movement from
upstream R&D to downstream commercialization. A
different trajectory would emphasize the catalyzing
role of geographic centers, stressing the capacity of
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

initial entrants to identify new knowledge and relevant skills developed outside their regions. In this scenario, the most well-connected early entrants would
be the most capable at accessing new ideas (Koput
and Powell 2001). Combined with the overwhelming
initial importance of regional clusters, this latter pattern implies that we should observe a process of delocalization of PRO-DBF ties over time. This delocalization would be facilitated by the generalist research
focus of core organizations highlighted in Figure 4.
We begin by mapping alterations in the level
of geographic clustering of PRO-DBF relationships
in the United States. The biotechnology industry’s
early development in the United States depended
on regional concentrations of co-located universities, ﬁrms, research organizations, and key resource
providers such as law and venture capital. Thus the
earliest linkages between biotech ﬁrms and public
research organizations should be dominated by relationships in which both partners are co-located in
the same geographic region. If this sector evolves as
established “local” players expand their set of potential partners and as new technologies become standard practice, then the proportion of ties with regionally co-located or “local” partners should decline over
time.
Figure 5 presents both graphical and quantitative
evidence for the process of industry evolution. The
ﬁgure on the left represents 1988, on the right, 1998.
The triangles represent the six most active regions
where biotechnology originated, and their location on
the pyramid reﬂects the volume of the interorganizational linkages that connect them to other areas.
The size of the triangle reﬂects the number of ties
within the region. Thus, Boston is both the most
connected region internally and the most extensively
linked externally.
Note the aggregate decline in the percentage of
local ties from a high of just over 40% in 1988 to a
low of 8% in 1998. This decline occurs in the context
of a rising volume of collaborations, the number of
ties active in 1998 is more than double the number a
decade before. The combination of an increasing number of collaborations and a decreasing proportion of
local connections represents the declining importance
of ties within the initial regional clusters. Figure 5

indicates that the growing volume of PRO-industry
ties in U.S. biomedicine occurred in the context of
a shift in the distribution of those ties, such that
the importance of geographic propinquity decreased,
while the prevalence of network linkages between
organizations in different areas increased.
As noted above, the sharp decline in local ties
within established regions could, in the context of
an aggregate increase in connections, result from
three very different trajectories: (1) deepening ties
across established regions (e.g., links between triangles in Figure 5); (2) connections from established
regions to other areas of the nation (e.g., ties connecting nodes above the dashed lines to those below
it); or (3) increasing linkages involving two partners located outside established regions. Figure 5
shows that the second of these options describes the
38

bulk of changes in the regional distribution of ties
as the U.S. national network expanded over a 10year period. While within-cluster and cross-cluster
ties declined, and ties that do not involve established
clusters showed only a slight increase, the proportion
of linkages involving a partner in an established cluster and one in another region of the country more
than doubled, accounting for about 54% of all connections by 1998.
We contend that this important structural shift illuminates a dual process of network expansion that
encompasses both increased scale and a shifting geographic distribution. In our view, this transformation is enabled by both the generalist scientiﬁc role
played by elite PROs within established regional clusters (recall Figure 4) and by the integrative role of
the National Institutes of Health (recall Figure 2).

Moreover, the regional clusters that gave birth to the
U.S. national network may have already contained the
seeds of this change.
We turn to closer analysis of one U.S. regional
“starting point” to examine this possibility. A persistent question we have entertained is whether the
U.S. system is simply different and more diverse
because of its larger scale. So we examine a single
regional cluster at an early point in its development to
ascertain whether organizational diversity and integration between research and the clinic were present
from the founding of the ﬁeld. Consider Figure 6,
which presents two views of interorganizational linkages involving the Boston region, the most prominent
regional cluster apparent in Figures 2 and 5. Figure
6A represents only linkages internal to Boston in 1988.
These are the speciﬁc interorganizational ties represented by the size of the Boston node in Figure 5.
Figure 6B highlights all ties involving at least one
partner in the Boston area in the same year. In both
Figure 6

cases, the shape of nodes represents the type of organization. Triangles are universities, circles are DBFs,
and squares are research institutes or hospitals. Node
size is a function of network degree such that the
largest nodes are the most connected. As with other
Pajek representations, the location of nodes relative to
each other is a function of the strength and pattern
of ties among them. Figure 6B adds shading to the
image to capture the geographic location of partners.
Black nodes (of any shape) are located in the Boston
metro area. Gray nodes are located in one of the other
established regional clusters (Figure 5’s triangles), and
white nodes are located in other areas of the country.
In Figure 6A, the organizational diversity of the
Boston area in 1988 is clear. Firms (e.g., Seragen,
Genzyme, Cambridge Bio), universities (Tufts, Harvard, MIT, BU), research institutes (Dana-Farber), and
hospitals (Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General) are connected to local partners. Nevertheless,
that organizational diversity is apparent in a rela-

tively sparse network of connections that makes the
Boston region look less clustered than our earlier analyses suggest. A key research institute and a hospital
(Brigham and Women’s and Dana-Farber) are isolated
from the central network corridor. Viewed through
a Boston-only lens, the region appears composed of
loosely connected clusters surrounding MIT and Harvard. Organizational heterogeneity was common in
Boston in 1988, but the early density of the Boston network appears to be a function of organizations located
in other areas of the nation.
At a glance, Figure 6B looks more like a coherent regional network than Figure 6A. Three important clusters (surrounding Dana-Farber, Harvard, and
MIT) are brought into closer connection by diverse
organizations located outside of Boston. Consider the
structural roles played by the UC system, Stanford,
Centocor (a Philadelphia-based DBF), and the SloanKettering Cancer Institute (located in New York City).
These four organizations add a coda to our story
of organizational diversity. While Boston is internally diverse, the density of the region’s innovation networks is greatly increased by the inclusion
of diverse organizations from other geographic locations. Figure 6B captures a single regional “starting
point” and demonstrates that the diversity and density of Boston’s networks is a function of both local
depth and ties that connect multiple regions. Note
also the key role played by Boston DBFs in reaching out to PROs located in other areas of the country.
Recall from Figure 5 that it is exactly this type of tie
(indicated by connections from black nodes to white
nodes in Fig. 6B) that promotes the expansion of the
U.S. national system. Unpacking the structure of the
PRO-DBF network in Boston at an early time provides
two key insights into the development of the U.S.
national systems documented in Figure 5. First, the
seeds of that expansion were already present in one
focal region as early as 1988. The lesson of Figure 6B
is that ties to key organizations in other parts of the
country helped make Boston a major regional starting
point. Second, Figure 6B emphasizes the central role
that small science-based ﬁrms played in connecting
with other areas of the nation. A quick glance at the
local Boston nodes (black) in the ﬁgure suggests that
40

it is DBFs such as T Cell Sciences that connect to geographically distant PROs rather than the elite PROs
linking to distant ﬁrms.
In essence, the dual process we highlight reveals
that a national U.S. biomedical network grew from
regionally clustered beginnings on the strength of
overlapping scientiﬁc expertise, the critical integrative effect of the NIH, and the expansive role played
by small ﬁrms. In the European case, the absence
of strong scientiﬁc overlap (recall the national scientiﬁc specialization apparent in Figure 3), a single key upstream institution such as the NIH, or
rapidly developing small ﬁrms mitigate against this
type of network expansion. These critical differences,
we argue, have several notable consequences. First
the relative homogeneity of elite European PROs—
few European universities and no European hospitals
appear in either Figure 2 or Figure 3—suggests that
in addition to scientiﬁc specialization, European networks will be less integrated across the development
process than their U.S. counterparts, which include
universities, hospitals, and research institutes. Second,
the integrative role played by the U.S. National Institutes of Health occurs much further downstream in
Europe, as large pharmaceutical companies undertake
the bulk of cross-national European research collaborations (recall Table 1). Finally, there is a very different role for small science-based ﬁrms in the U.S.
and European contexts. Where Figure 6 shows that as
early as 1988 it was small ﬁrms in Boston that were
linked to disparate and geographically diffuse PROs,
Table 1 indicates that in Europe, small ﬁrms play
a local role, deepening ties within scientiﬁcally specialized national clusters rather than reaching across
them.

Conclusions

Our analyses of university-industry interfaces in the
United States and Europe emphasize the importance
of the division of innovative labor. We do not object to
arguments that the United States’ ﬁrst-mover advantage was critical in establishing the trajectory of the
ﬁeld. But we supplement this explanation by stressing the diversity of actors involved and the varied
roles played by scientiﬁc specialists and generalists.

Without recognizing these elements in the context
of an evolutionary trajectory shaped by distinct cultural and institutional contexts, European efforts to
“catch up” to the United States by mirroring established policies and arrangements will likely be misguided. Central to the U.S. system are two key factors:
relational and integrative capability. A wide diversity of U.S. organizations has established protocols in
place for fostering research collaboration. Moreover,
these alliances span organizations with different missions and serve to link basic research with clinical
development.
The institutional structure of biomedical research
evolved quite differently in Europe and the
United States. The diversity of the U.S. public research
system, a highly mobile scientiﬁc labor force, and a
host of regulatory and policy initiatives promoted
widespread commercialization of academically originated research, largely through the founding of small
biotechnology ﬁrms. In addition, the generalist technological role and integrative development proﬁles
of U.S. public research organizations have capitalized
on scientiﬁc developments in molecular biology that
more closely link goal-oriented therapeutic research
with fundamental biological investigation. European
universities developed competencies in molecular biology less quickly than specialized research
institutes. The disciplinary focus of these institutes,
combined with the centralizing effects of national
R&D funding infrastructures and regulatory contexts,
serve to limit universities’ participation in commercially oriented R&D and concentrate R&D networks
in specialized national clusters.
We also observe qualitively different paths in the
development of local centers of excellence in the
United States and Europe. In the former case, generalist regional clusters developed around public research
organizations that integrated innovation and development work. These clusters planted the seeds of
accumulative advantage as the regions attracted talented researchers, high quality students, and increasing shares of R&D funding, in addition to for-proﬁt
ﬁrms dedicated to the commercialization of new technologies. In Europe, national clusters of specialists
may also have beneﬁtted from accumulative advantage in research funding and talent, but the funding sources were national rather than European, and
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

research priorities and a community of local specialist ﬁrms may have deepened already narrow competencies rather than enabling broad exploration.
The role that European pharmaceutical corporations
played as clearinghouses for innovations developed
within these national clusters may have also mitigated
against the broadening of regional scientiﬁc and organizational competencies.
Finally, notable differences in the constellation of
organizations able to capture and develop innovations aided in pushing U.S. and European industries in different evolutionary directions. We observe
divergent roles played by public research organization originators, dedicated biotechnology ﬁrms,
and large pharmaceutical companies that contribute
to disparate industry outcomes in Europe and the
United States. Our emphasis on the diversity of types
of organizations and their multiple roles stands as a
corrective to policy attempts to develop high volume
collaborations in Europe through copying American
policies. Our focus on the division of innovative labor
implies that European efforts to adopt U.S. policies
should be directed more at generating integration
between basic research and clinical development and
fostering extensive linkages among universities, small
ﬁrms, and the heretofore dominant public institutes
and large pharmaceutical companies.
