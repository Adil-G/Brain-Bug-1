responsiveness

Background: Social phobia aggregates in families. The genetic contribution to intergenerational
transmission is modest, and parenting is considered important. Research on the effects of social phobia
on parenting has been subject to problems of small sample size, heterogeneity of samples and
lack of specificity of observational frameworks. We addressed these problems in the current
study. Methods: We assessed mothers with social phobia (N ¼ 84) and control mothers (N ¼ 89) at
10 weeks in face-to-face interactions with their infants, and during a social challenge, namely, engaging
with a stranger. We also assessed mothers with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) (N ¼ 50). We
examined the contribution to infant social responsiveness of early infant characteristics (neonatal
irritability), as well as maternal behaviour. Results: Mothers with social phobia were no less sensitive
to their infants during face-to-face interactions than control mothers, but when interacting with the
stranger they appeared more anxious, engaged less with the stranger themselves, and were less
encouraging of the infant’s interaction with the stranger; infants of index mothers also showed reduced
social responsiveness to the stranger. These differences did not apply to mothers with GAD and their
infants. Regression analyses showed that the reduction in social responsiveness in infants of mothers
with social phobia was predicted by neonatal irritability and the degree to which the mother encouraged
the infant to interact with the stranger. Conclusions: Mothers with social phobia show specific parenting difficulties, and their infants show early signs of reduced social responsiveness that are related
to both individual infant differences and a lack of maternal encouragement to engage in social
interactions. Keywords: Anxiety, social phobia, parenting, mother–infant interactions, irritability. Abbreviations: GAD: generalised anxiety disorder.

Social phobia is a common disorder, affecting between 7% and 13% of individuals (Furmark, 2002). It
is a persistent, disabling condition, at the extreme
end of a continuum of social anxiety, in which the
central psychopathological feature is an intense fear
of scrutiny and negative evaluation by others, with a
consequent avoidance of social encounters, and
markedly restricted social functioning.
Social phobia aggregates in families, with children of affected parents being themselves at raised
risk (Mancini, van Ameringen, Szatmari, Fugere, &
Boyle, 1996; Lieb et al., 2000). Notably, such
aggregation shows specificity: first-degree relatives
of individuals with social phobia are at increased
risk for social phobia, but not other anxiety disorders (Fyer, Mannuzza, Chapman, Martin, &
Klein, 1995). While there is evidence for genetic
mechanisms operating in intergenerational transmission, their contribution is modest (an estimated
heritability of 10% (Nelson et al., 2000)), and
environmental effects are likely to be significant.
One important environmental influence is the
quality of parenting. A number of dimensions have
been considered relevant (Wood, McLeod, Sigman,

Hwang, & Chu, 2003). These include general
characteristics, such as lack of warmth, as well as
specific dimensions of over-protection and control
that may limit children’s opportunities to develop
mastery and competence. Parents may also promote child anxiety by disengaging from potentially
threatening situations, or by failing to encourage
their children and promote their autonomy. In so
doing, they may model fearful responses to the
child, thereby enhancing the likelihood of child
fearfulness. Notably, however, most studies of the
role of parenting have concerned anxious adults
retrospectively reporting on the parenting they received, or anxious children interacting with their
parents. Such studies do not, therefore, directly
address the question of the influence of parental
anxiety disorder on parental behaviour and on
child development. In fact, studies of anxious
parents and their children, whether involving direct
observations of parenting (Woodruff-Borden, Morrow, Bourland, & Cambron, 2002; Turner, Beidel,
Robertson-Nay, & Tervo, 2003; Moore, Whaley, &
Sigman, 2004), or interview and questionnaire
methods (Hirschfeld, Biederman, Brody, Faraone,
& Rosenbaum, 1997; Rubin, Nelson, Hastings, &
Asendorpf, 1999; McClure, Brennan, Hammen, &

Lynne Murray et al.

Le Brocque, 2001; Lieb et al., 2000) have generally
found little evidence for raised rates of parental
rejection, over-control and over-protection; and
where parental anxiety has been associated with
such impairments, this has usually been in the
context of difficult child characteristics (Moore
et al., 2004; Hirschfeld et al., 1997; Rubin et al.,
1999), suggesting that disturbances in child
behaviour may elicit these parenting styles.
Few studies have examined the effects of adult
anxiety on relationships with infants, and firm
conclusions cannot be drawn. Feldman and colleagues (Feldman, Greenbaum, Mayes, & Erlich,
1997) studied mothers and infants at three and
nine months, measuring maternal trait anxiety at
both times. Decreasing anxiety over time predicted
increased maternal sensitivity, although maternal
anxiety in this population was within the normal
range. Weinberg and Tronick (1998) studied a
small sample of mothers with panic disorder,
depression or obsessive compulsive disorder. Index
mothers were more disengaged and negative with
their infants than controls but, as the authors
note, the role of particular diagnoses is unclear.
Similar difficulties of interpretation apply to the
studies of Warren et al. (2003) and Field et al.
(2005). In the former, mothers with panic disorder
were found to be less sensitive than controls in
early infancy, and less effective at disciplining at
14 months, but it would be premature to conclude
that these effects resulted from the anxiety disorder, since index mothers commonly had other
disorders, including depression. Similarly, Field
and colleagues (2005) reported maternal withdrawal from the infant to be related to maternal
anxiety, but since all the mothers in this study had
co-morbid depression, it is not clear whether these
findings can be generalised to mothers who
experience anxiety alone.
Aside from the small sample sizes and problems
concerning co-morbid depression, a particular difficulty of previous research has been the heterogeneity
of diagnoses within the anxious groups themselves
and the lack of specificity in the assessments. This is
important because different anxiety disorders may
have distinctive effects on parenting, rather than
affecting performance across the board; and, in
general, the observational frames used in research
have been non-specific.
In the light of these considerations, we recruited a
large sample of mothers with social phobia and
their infants, and compared their behaviour with
that of a non-anxious control group in a situation
designed to elucidate index mothers’ social difficulties, namely, having to converse with an unfamiliar person and manage their infant’s engagement
with the stranger. An important question was
whether infants of index mothers showed signs of
impaired social responsiveness, and whether such
impairments were related to maternal social diffi-

culties. Moreover, to assess whether any difficulties
experienced by mothers and infants were specific to
social phobia, we also observed a group with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in the absence of
social phobia.
We also examined the contribution of infant
characteristics. Genetic studies suggest that heritability of a general emotional vulnerability may
confer risk for social phobia. Support for such a
mechanism also derives from findings that behavioural inhibition, usually measured from late
infancy, raises the risk of anxiety disorder, especially
the social type (Turner, Beidel, & Wolff, 1996; Hirschfeld et al., 1992; Biederman et al., 1993; Hayward, Killen, Kraemer, & Taylor, 1998). Although the
stability of such behaviour through infancy is not
strong, one precursor comprises emotional and
behavioural reactivity (Kagan & Snidman, 1991).
This measure, established for infants of four months,
is conceptually closely related to that of neonatal
irritability (Brazelton & Nugent, 1995). Irritability is
characterised by marked sensitivity to changes in
the environment, with rapid escalation of distress
and difficulty in regulating state to become calm
again. In the current study, therefore, as well as investigating the effects of maternal diagnosis and
maternal behaviour on infant social responsiveness,
we assessed the role of neonatal irritability.

Method
Sample
Four thousand mothers attending routine 20-week
antenatal scan clinics at the Royal Berkshire (UK) hospital completed screening questionnaires for social
phobia and GAD. Five hundred and twenty-five high
scoring women were re-contacted; of these, 154 (29.3%)
refused to participate in the study, and 67 (12.8%) were
found to be ineligible (e.g., because of moving away). The
remaining 304 women were interviewed within the
following month to confirm diagnosis. Of these, 139
(45.7%) did not meet diagnostic criteria; 107 women were
identified with social phobia, and 58 had GAD (but no
social phobia). Fourteen of these women subsequently
became ineligible for the study (e.g., due to premature
delivery, infant death), 12 in the Social phobia group and
2 in the GAD group. A random sample of 164 women with
low screening scores were also approached for participation as controls: 32 (19.4%) refused to take part, and
nine (5.5%) were ineligible. The remaining 123 were
interviewed to assess their mental state: 21 were excluded as they had disorders other than social phobia or
GAD, and seven became ineligible; one was diagnosed
with social phobia and was therefore recruited into
the social phobia group, bringing the total to 96; the
remaining 94 women were recruited as controls on the
basis of having no current or past social phobia or GAD.
At 10 weeks postpartum, 84 (87.5%) and 89 (94.7%) of
these mothers were assessed in the social phobia and
control groups respectively, as were 50 (87.7%) of
mothers with GAD.

Procedure
Neonatal irritability was assessed at 10 days in the
home, in quiet conditions with low lighting. Mothers
and infants then came to the University research rooms
at 10 weeks. Following a settling-in period during which
the study procedures were explained, mothers completed mental state questionnaires; at a point when the
infant was alert and contented, mothers and infants
were observed during a five-minute face-to-face interaction. A female researcher, who was unknown to the
mother, then entered the room; she called the infant’s
name, and approached mother and infant; she paused
to stand alongside the mother, spoke to the infant
again, and then lifted the infant from his/her chair and
tried to engage him/her in social interaction. The
stranger episode lasted 2½ minutes. Both episodes
were videotaped throughout. Two researchers scored
the mother–infant interactions, and two other
researchers scored the stranger–mother–infant episodes; all were unaware of maternal diagnosis.

Measures
Maternal mental state. Screening questionnaires: An
eight-item version of the Social Interaction and Anxiety
Scale and the Social Phobia Scale (SIAS and SPS;
Mattick & Clarke, 1998), and a five-item version of the
Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller,
Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990) were used. Items were included on the basis of their high factor loadings on
these measures. A pilot of each screen identified cut-off
scores for the top 10% of respondents.1 Full versions of
the questionnaires were completed at the 10-week
assessment.
Diagnostic Interview: Mothers were interviewed with
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1
disorders (SCID-1; First et al., 1995) by trained psychologists and mental health clinicians. All interviews were
subsequently discussed with a senior clinical team to
confirm diagnosis and assignment to the three study
groups. The rate of concurrent major depressive disorder was low for all groups: 7.1% for those with social
phobia, 5.2% for those with GAD, and 1.1% for those in
the control group.
Infant behavioural characteristics. The Neonatal
Behavioural Assessment Scale (Brazelton & Nugent,
1995) was administered by trained psychologists to
identify infant irritability.2 This scale has been widely
used, and has good reliability and validity. We used the
items ‘peak of excitement’, ‘rapidity of build up’ and
‘irritability’ collectively to define infants as irritable
(Cronbach’s alpha ¼ .83) if the mean score was six or
over, a standard method used in research (e.g., Crockenberg, 1981; van den Boom, 1994, Murray, Stanley,
Hooper, King, & Fiori-Cowley, 1996a).

number of other maternal disorders, as well as different
infant populations (Murray et al., 1996a; Murray, FioriCowley, Hooper, & Cooper, 1996b; Gunning et al.,
2004). Maternal behaviour was characterised on
dimensions of sensitivity (warmth, acceptance,
responsiveness, non-demanding and overall sensitivity
scales), active engagement (verbal and non-verbal), and
expressed anxiety (e.g., biting lip, tense posture, worried expression). Infants were rated on the dimensions
of positive communication (attention to mother, vocal
and behavioural expressiveness), and distress (crying
and fretfulness).

Mother–stranger–infant interactions. These were
similarly scored on five-point scales, some being devised specifically for this study. Maternal dimensions
comprised the degree of engagement with the stranger
(greeting, making eye contact, smiling, conversing),
control of the infant–stranger interaction (e.g., speaking
to the stranger on the infant’s behalf, touching the infant during the stranger–infant interaction), encouragement to the infant to interact with the stranger (e.g.,
making positive comments, making encouraging facial
expressions and gestures), and expressed anxiety (as
for the mother–infant interaction). Infant behaviour
during this episode was scored on three dimensions:
degree of attention to mother, positive communication
with the stranger and distress (the last two being defined as for the mother–infant engagement).
A random sample of 20 videotapes were scored by the
same researchers to establish reliability. Intra-class
correlations were, for maternal behaviour with the infant, mean ¼ .81, range ¼ .75–.86, infant behaviour
with the mother, mean ¼ .90, range .79–.96, maternal
behaviour in the stranger episode, mean ¼ .86, range
.78–.94, and infant behaviour in the stranger episode,
mean ¼ .89, range .82–.94.

Data analysis
Comparisons between the behaviour of mothers and
infants in the social phobia and control groups were
made using t-tests where variables were normally distributed and chi square tests for binary variables.
Where significant differences were identified, comparisons were made between the GAD and control groups
to see if such effects were specific to social phobia or a
function of more general anxiety. We used correlational
analyses to explore the relationship of neonatal irritability to 10-week infant behaviour with the stranger,
and to examine the relation between the mother’s
behaviour with the infant during the episode with the
stranger and the infant’s response. Since infant irritability may have made the infant vulnerable to the impact of maternal social phobia, we also examined the
effects of the interaction between irritability and both
maternal group and the mother’s management of the
infant during the episode with the stranger, using
ANOVA and binary logistic regression, as appropriate.
The contribution of early infant irritability and maternal
behaviour to any differences between the social phobia
and control groups in infants’ response to the stranger
was then examined in regression analyses. Since male
and female infants have been found to differ in their

response to maternal depression, we also investigated
whether infant sex affected infant behaviour. Finally,
since previous studies have found depression to cooccur with anxiety, thus confounding the interpretation
of findings, the analyses were repeated, excluding any
mothers with major depression.

Results
The characteristics of mothers and infants are
shown in Table 1. The three study groups were
demographically similar, although a few more
mothers from the GAD group were not Caucasian.
Most mothers were married or cohabiting, and were
from middle-upper class families. Scores on the Social Phobia and GAD screening questionnaires for
those who declined to participate did not differ from
those of women who were recruited: for the Social
Phobia screen, scores were, respectively, 23.05
(SD ¼ 4.05) and 22.74 (SD ¼ 4.55) (t ¼ .61, NS); and
for the GAD screen, they were 18.02 (SD ¼ 2.77) and
18.21 (SD ¼ 2.18), (t ¼ .59, NS). Scores on the SIAS
and SPS at 10 weeks showed that women in the social phobia group continued to show clinically significant levels of symptoms, distinguishing them
from both the control and GAD group mothers.

Mother–infant and mother–stranger–infant
interactions
All scales for the mother–infant interactions were
normally distributed, as were maternal anxiety and
encouragement in the stranger episode; the
remaining variables were skewed and were therefore
dichotomised.

Interaction differences between social phobia and
control groups
As can be seen from Table 2, when interacting with
their infants mothers with social phobia were more
anxious than control mothers, and they were also

less actively engaged; they were, however, similar to
controls in terms of their general sensitivity. There
were no differences between the two groups of infants
in terms of the degree to which they were positively
engaged with their mother, or were distressed.
During the episode with the stranger, mothers
with social phobia were again more anxious than
control group mothers, and they were also less likely
to engage with the stranger. With regard to the
management of the infant during this episode,
mothers with social phobia were less encouraging of
their infants’ interaction with the stranger, but they
were no more likely to try to control the stranger–
infant engagement. As in the mother–infant interaction, the two groups of infants showed no
difference in their degree of distress; nevertheless,
infants of index mothers tended to be more likely to
remain attentive to their mother while the stranger
was present, and they were significantly less likely to
communicate positively with the stranger when she
attempted to interact with them.
There were no differences between boys’ and girls’
behaviour on any dimension, and therefore infant
sex was not considered further.

Specificity of interaction differences
We assessed whether the features of the social
phobia group which distinguished them from controls also characterised mothers with GAD and
their infants. In the mother–infant interaction,
mothers with GAD were not significantly more
anxious than control mothers (GAD mean ¼ 3.1,
SD ¼ 1.3, vs. control mean 2.7, SD ¼ 1.2, t(134) ¼
1.65), but, as for mothers with social phobia, they
were significantly less actively engaged with their
infants than controls (GAD mean ¼ 2.3, SD ¼ .8
vs. control mean 2.6, SD ¼ .9, t(134) ¼ 2.17, p ¼
.03). During the stranger episode, by contrast,
where mothers with social phobia differed from
controls on three of the four dimensions assessed,
mothers with GAD were indistinguishable from

mothers were comparable to controls (GAD 28% vs.
control 27.3%, v2 t(1) ¼ .01).

Prediction of reduced infant responsiveness
Having established that infants of mothers with
social phobia were less likely than control group
infants to engage positively with the stranger, and
that this difference was specific to their mother
having social phobia, we then proceeded, using
correlational analyses, to explore the possible basis
for this difference in terms of the distinctive features of maternal behaviour during the stranger
episode and in terms of the infant’s own characteristics. Since directional predictions were made,
one-tailed tests were used. Maternal encouragement of the infant’s interaction with the stranger
was associated with more positive infant responsiveness (rb(168) ¼ .18, p < .01), but the level of
expressed anxiety and the degree of maternal engagement with the stranger were unrelated to the
infant’s response (rb(168) ¼ ).07, and phi (169) ¼
.07, respectively). With regard to neonatal behaviour, we first compared the rate of irritability in
the social phobia and control groups. This applied
to 16 (20%) neonates in the social phobia group,
and 10 (11.5%) control group infants, a difference
that was not significant (v2 (1) ¼ 2.29). We then
examined the correlation between neonatal irritability and infant responsiveness to the stranger. As
expected, infants who were classified as irritable as

neonates were less likely to engage positively with
the stranger at 10 weeks than non-irritable infants
(phi(167) ¼ ).15, p < .05). We then investigated
whether irritability may have made the infant more
vulnerable to the effects of maternal social phobia,
examining the effects on infant responsiveness to
the stranger of interactions between irritability and
both maternal group and the mother’s behaviour
during the stranger episode. None of these was
significant.
In a final analysis, we used logistic regression to
address the question of whether the effect of maternal social phobia on the infant’s response to the
stranger still held when taking into account neonatal
irritability and the mother’s encouragement of the
infant’s interaction with the stranger. As can be seen
in Table 3, whereas the effect of maternal group was
significant when considered alone in the first step,
when infant irritability and maternal encouragement
were included, the effect of maternal social phobia
was reduced.
All analyses reported above were repeated excluding women with depression; this did not affect the
pattern of findings.

Discussion
Much previous research on the effects of maternal
anxiety disorder on parenting has been subject to
methodological difficulties, including sample heterogeneity, lack of specificity of observational frames,
and small sample sizes. We addressed these problems by recruiting a large, diagnostically homogeneous, community sample of mothers with social
phobia, and observed them in a situation designed to
elucidate social anxiety. In order to address the
question of specificity of effects, we also assessed a
group of mothers with GAD, but no social phobia,
and their infants. Finally, we aimed to assess the
contribution of infant characteristics by making
objective infant assessments within a prospective,
longitudinal design.
A number of findings were notable. First, there was
no evidence for general parenting deficits in mothers
with social phobia. Thus, although these mothers
appeared to be more anxious and somewhat more
withdrawn than control mothers when interacting
with their children, they showed no deficits in terms
of their general sensitivity to the infant, and they
were no more controlling than non-anxious mothers.
Given this, it was not surprising that these mothers’
infants were no more distressed than control group
infants and engaged in positive communication with
their mothers to the same extent. These findings are
consistent with those of a number of other studies of
anxious parents, where normal levels of warmth,
acceptance and control have been documented (Lieb
et al., 2000; McClure et al., 2001; Woodruff-Borden
et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004),
in spite of somewhat reduced levels of engagement
(Woodruff-Borden et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2003).
Notably, these findings differ markedly from studies
of depressed mothers, where impairments appear
more pervasive, and the impact on the infant correspondingly more marked (Murray & Cooper, 2003).
As predicted, mothers with social phobia had
particular difficulties in the context of a social challenge, that is, having to converse with a stranger and
observe their infant in interaction with the stranger.
In this situation, not only did socially phobic
mothers appear more anxious and fail to engage with
the stranger, but they were also significantly less
encouraging of their infant’s engagement with the
stranger; in turn, their infants tended to remain
attentive to their mother during the period when the
stranger sought to interact with them, and were less
likely to communicate positively with the stranger. In
sum, while the effects on the infant were not strong,
the findings suggest that infants of mothers with
social phobia may show early signs of reduced social
responsiveness.
The findings for mothers with social phobia contrasted with those for mothers with GAD, suggesting
anxiety subgroup-specific effects. These were particularly evident in the context of the social challenge

where, unlike mothers with social phobia, those with
GAD were indistinguishable from control group
mothers in terms of manifest anxiety, engagement
with the stranger, and encouragement of their infants. Similarly, their infants did not show the pattern of reduced social responsiveness shown by
those of mothers with social phobia. This underlines
the importance of taking into account different
diagnostic groupings, and of constructing situations
for research that are specific to the disorder in
question, if parenting difficulties associated with the
disorder are to be elucidated.
We attempted to investigate the sources of the reduced infant social responsiveness associated with
maternal social phobia. There was some evidence that
infant characteristics may be important. Neonatal
irritability was present in almost twice as many infants of social phobia mothers as control mothers and,
although this difference was not statistically significant, it did appear that this infant behavioural constellation influenced infant responsiveness to the
stranger. This finding is consistent with those of a
number of other studies that have highlighted the
importance of infant and child characteristics, both as
they affect parental behaviour to bring about maladaptive patterns of responding (Cutrona & Troutman, 1986; Murray et al., 1996a), and as early
precursors of later social anxiety. Whether the
association between neonatal irritability and reduced
social responsiveness involves the genetic mechanisms that have so far been identified in relation to
social phobia and other affective disorders, or the
possible impact of maternal antenatal anxiety on the
foetus (Glover & O’Connor, 2002), is unclear.
Maternal behaviour also appeared important in
influencing infant social responsiveness, and particularly the extent to which the mother encouraged
her infant to engage socially with the stranger.
Control mothers would typically use a warm, reassuring tone, and invite their infant to interact with
the stranger, often marking this message in a stereotypical fashion, with clear eyebrow flashes, smiles
and nods of the head, whereas mothers with social
phobia would more often avert their gaze and remain
motionless. The mechanisms underlying the link
between these maternal behaviours and infant
responsiveness are unclear. At 10 weeks it is unlikely that any process of ‘social referencing’ is
occurring, whereby infants actively solicit information from others to guide their behaviour in response
to ambiguous or novel situations (see review by
Feinman, Roberts, Hsieh, Sawyer, & Swanson,
1992). Thus, while our previous work has shown
that this mechanism is indeed important in the
context of infant responses to unfamiliar adults (de
Rosnay, Cooper, Tsigaras, & Murray, in press), such
effects have not been demonstrated until around
nine months. On the other hand, a large body
of evidence has accumulated showing infants to
be highly sensitive to many parameters of adult

communication in the first few months, including
voice quality, direction of gaze, the degree of contingency, and facial expressions of emotion (Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001). Mothers modulate these
behaviours on a moment-to-moment basis to maintain their infant’s engagement and regulate their affect (Tronick & Gianino, 1986). It is possible that the
reduced social responsiveness to the stranger on the
part of infants of mothers with social phobia arose as
a consequence of the attenuation of these regulatory
maternal behaviours, as the socially phobic mothers
became more withdrawn and less encouraging in the
presence of the stranger.
The longer-term consequences of the early behaviour towards the stranger we observed in infants of
mothers with social phobia are unclear. It is
important to note that we did not observe frank
avoidance or distress, but rather a reduction in
normal positive responsiveness. Whether such
behaviour is a precursor of later frank, socially
anxious behaviour remains to be investigated.
