Predicting and Understanding
Organization Structure
Size is examined as a predictor of organizationstructure with data from a
British sample of business organizations,supplemented by findings from British
labor unions, engineeringfirms,and the Aston sample of varied work organizations.' Where possible, comparisonis also made with the results of an American
study. While the broad outlines of formal organizationstructuresare predictable
with a high degree of confidencefrom a knowledge of organizationsize, a comparisonof size-structureregressionsacross differentindustriessuggests that other
variablesmust also be taken into account. A solution, more satisfying both theoreticallyand statistically,emerges when complexityis distinguishedfrom other
aspects of structure which more directly constitute the framework of bureaucratic control-namely, the degree of formalizationand decentralization.It is
then found that while size, with technology, location and environmentalvariables, predicts complexity,the degree of complexityitself has a more direct relationship with formalizationthan does size. Size, however, remains the major
predictorof decentralization.It is concluded that, in the organizationsstudied,
complexity cannot be satisfactorilypredicted or fully understoodwithout reference to the economicsof scale, but that it is neither theoreticallyconvincing nor
statisticallydemonstrablethat size in itself is the majordeterminantof formalization.
Large-scale complex organization and bureaucracy are often regarded as synonymous.
Within this identity, however, are submerged two major issues which continue to
exercise the minds of organization theorists.
First, how critical is size as a predictor, if
not a determinant, of organizational structure? Second, is complexity also important for
predicting the form of organization, and if
so how is it associated with size and other
contextual variables?
Size of organization has often been cited
as the attribute having the greatest single
influence on the extent to which organiza-

tions develop bureaucratic forms of organization structure. Thus Weber (1958:
211) commented on the "role of sheer
quantity as a leverage for the bureaucratization of a social structure". Pugh and
his colleagues (1969: 112) were prompted
by their research to suggest that "size
causes [bureaucratic] structuring through
its effect on intervening variables such as
the frequency of decisions and social control". In contrast, others such as Woodward (1965), Thompson (1967),
and
Aldrich (1972) have argued on theoretical
and empirical grounds that the tasks and
technology of an organization are more
salient influences on structure than is its
size. Hall (1972: 139) has recently reviewed this debate, to which his own research has contributed, and he takes a
very qualified view on the role of size:

the logarithmic number of employees in
United States employment security agencies
and measures of structure comparable to
those of Pugh et al. (1968). Blau and Schoenherr's measure "number of hierarchical levels"
is identical to vertical span except that it excludes all deputy and assistant managers,
while Pugh et al. exclude only "assistants to".
Their measure "division of labor" is a count
of different job titles, ignoring different
grades, and has affinities with overall role
specialization except that the latter does not
include specialized roles in the main workflow function: that is, "production" and
equivalent roles. Blau and Schoenherr's
"number of divisions" compares with functional specialization, except for the same
reservation about the work-flow area and for
the further difference that it counts the
presence of more than one division within a
functionally specialized area. Their measures
of official civil service regulations and of
delegation are conceptually comparable to
standardization and decentralization in Pugh
et al., but operationally they are less close.
Blau and Schoenherr employed no measure
equivalent to the Pugh et al. measure of overall documentation.
Reading across Table 2, not only are all
the correlations between size and each structural variable consistently in the same direction, but in most cases the level of correlation
as an indicator of the strength of association
remains stable. This degree of stability is
noteworthy in view of the fact that the five
samples of organizations differed in location
and types of activity. The Blau-Schoenherr
correlations depart from the levels shown by
the studies using the Aston measures with
extent of regulations and with delegation.
This may be due to these being less comparable with the Aston equivalents. Among
the Aston school of studies, the relationship
between size and overall centralization of
decision making exhibits the greatest amount
of variation, with the correlation for the
original Aston study being noticeably lower
than that in the other three studies. It was
pointed out in an earlier paper on organization structure (Child, 1972) that the Pugh
et al. (1968) measure of centralization is
sensitive to differences in the status of an

171

organization; in particular whether it is a
branch (site, department, or similar unit) or
whether it has higher status as a relatively
self-sufficient functioning unit. The original
Aston sample, unlike the other three studies,
included a large proportion of branches
(twenty out of forty-six organizations), and
this feature may account for some of the
differences in correlations. Donaldson (1972)
has also indicated that the inclusion of governmental organizations in the Aston sample
shifted the level of this correlation.
With a few explicable exceptions, the proportion of variance in the major dimensions
of organization structure predictable from
knowing the size of organizations appears to
be highly consistent across different samples
of work organizations. Larger organizations
are more bureaucratic. It is also evident
from Table 2 that the strength of the sizestructure relationship tends to rise among
manufacturing organizations. It is not clear
at present whether this points to a real difference in this relationship as between service
and manufacturing organizations, or whether
it is partly a product of the Pugh et al.
(1968) schedule of measures, which is still
slightly oriented towards manufacturing operations.
Forms of Association between Size and
Organization Structure
A general statement of the form of association between size and organization structure
has just been given. Larger organizations are
more specialized, have more rules, more documentation, more extended hierarchies, and
a greater decentralization of decision making
further down such hierarchies. This, however, is merely to state the direction of relationships between size and structure. Can we
be more precise by identifying the ratios or
slopes of structural values in relation to
changes in organizational size? Are these
slopes consistent when comparing different
samples of organizations? If they are, then
we may find ourselves on the threshold of
precise prediction which has real practical
value as well as theoretical significance.
Blau and Schoenherr (1971) explored the
relationship between size of organization and

<-----Page 5----->172

structural differentiation. They saw differentiation as having a horizontal dimension, in
terms of the number of divisions and the division of labor, and a vertical dimension in
terms of the number of hierarchical levels.
They found that although size had a positive
relationship with structural differentiation,
this was not linear: differentiation increased
with size at a declining rate. A logarithmic
transformation of size, as measured by total
numbers employed, therefore gave a higher
linear correlation with measures of structural
differentiation.
In Figures 1 to 3, the regression curves on
size of organization for three dimensions of
structural differentiation are compared for
data drawn from the National, Aston and
Blau-Schoenherr studies. A comparison is
made between the measures of vertical span,
functional specialization and overall role
specialization used in the first two studies
and, respectively, the number of hierarchical
levels, the number of divisions and the division of labor measures used by Blau and
Schoenherr. For purposes of broad comparison Blau and Schoenherr's method (1971: 64
note) for computing approximate regression
curves has been adopted for all the data in
Figures 1, 2, and 3. Blau and Shoenherr's

>

graphs have been transcribed as accurately
as possible to the scales shown.
The shape of the regression curves is similar for the three sets of data in each of the
diagrams, and in the case of vertical span
and number of hierarchical levels the curves
are almost identical (Figure 1). Here Blau
and Schoenherr's measure comes operationally closest to that used with the National
and Aston data. The lower values per size
level of the Blau-Schoenherr curve are probably due to the exclusion from their measure
of any level bearing the title of deputy or assistant manager. For functional specialization
(Figure 2), the National and Aston curves
are similar in shape and suggest a more rapid
rise in departmentalization than the equivalent Blau and Schoenherr measure in organizations up to about 1,000 employees. For
overall role specialization (Figure 3), the
National and Aston curves show a more
marked decline in the rate of increase with
larger size than the Blau and Schoenherr
curve. Every curve in each- figure shows a
curvilinear decay function in the structural
variable when plotted against increasing size
of organization.

one unit of size, that is, logarithm values at
1.00 intervals. The coefficient for functional
specialization in the labor union study was
lower than in the other two samples, partly
because a few of the functional divisions
measured in the standard Aston schedule did
not readily fit labor union organization and
could not be adequately scored (Warner and
Donaldson, 1971). The labor union coefficient
for documentation is higher than for the
other two samples. This result would appear
tentatively to support the hypothesis ad-

tural variables in relation to size of organization, using the National and Aston data.
These indicated that each relationship with
size was curvilinear. The values for overall
standardization and documentation rose with
larger size but at a declining rate of increase.
Values for overall centralization fell with
larger size but at a declining rate of decrease.
A logarithmic transformation of size therefore raises the product-moment linear correlations with each of the structural values,
in both samples, as Table 3 shows.

The consistency shown by the regressions
of structural variables on size of organization
may be assessed more precisely by comparing the regression equations for both the National and Aston samples, and also for the
labor union sample studied by Warner and
Donaldson (1971). Raw data, secured by the
same measurements, were available for these
three samples. Table 4 gives a comparison of
values for the equation:

With the exception of centralization, the regression equations for each structural variable on size of organization were very similar, particularly in regard to the regression
coefficients, which indicate the rate at which
scores on the structural variable change with

vanced by Child et al. (1973) that in occupational interest associations such as unions,
the requirements of widespread geographical
communication, the recording of democratic
processes and other characteristics would result in (1) more paperwork than in other
types of organization of comparable size, and
(2) a certain minimum of paperwork whatever the size of organization. With the latter
proposition in mind, it may be noted that the
documentation constant for the labor union
sample is positive, unlike those for the two
other samples of organizations. The regression coefficients for vertical span were particularly close in the three studies, suggesting
that organizations employing 100, 1,000 and
10,000 personnel tend respectively to have
hierarchies extending to about four, six, and
seven to eight levels. Finally, the more disparate results between the three samples for
the regression of centralization on size may,
as has been suggested, be due in part to the
sensitivity of this measure, as a comparative
index, to definitions of hierarchical status
within organizations. Such definitions were
problematic in all three studies, especially

for labor unions with their combined systems
of representative and administrative authority.
So far we have only examined size as a
predictor of organization structure. It became apparent, however, from subjecting the
National data to an analysis of variance that
the location of the organizations studied in
their six separate industries also predicted
differences between some structural variables. These industries were advertising,
chocolate and sweets, daily newspapers, electronics, insurance, and pharmaceuticals. A
stratification by industry discriminated between scores on role specialization, functional specialization, standardization, and
documentation with approximately the same
degree of statistical confidence (p < .001)
as did a stratification by size groups. There
was no appreciable interaction between size
and industry as predictors. When the regressions of these structural variables on size
were recomputed industry by industry, the
values of constants and coefficients obtained
therefore became more dispersed, as shown
in Table 5 for functional specialization, standardization and documentation. For example,
the organizations located in the electronics
industry had large constants, but modest regression "slopes" compared to the other industry subsamples. This indicates that, when
contrasted to organizations of a similar size
located in other industries, small electronics
companies tend to have structures which are
more bureaucratized. Among larger organizations of, say, 10,000 employees, electronics companies do not, however, have
relatively very much more specialization,
standardization, or documentation than other
types of company. This pattern is also evident to a lesser degree among pharmaceutical companies. The small ones tend to be
rather bureaucratic as small companies go,
while the large companies, although still on
the bureaucratic side compared with other
large companies, are not extremely so.
To illustrate these industry patterns further, the regression equations obtained for
each industry group in the National sample
have been solved for two size levels that
constitute the extremities of the range sam-

pled: 100 employees and 10,000 employees.

The solutions obtained are listed in Table 6.
They suggest that in the manufacturing industries of electronics, pharmaceuticals, and
chocolate-sweets there is more interindustry
diversity of structures in small organizations
than in large ones, whereas organizations in
the service industries, advertising and insurance, tend to have relatively unbureaucratic
structures at all size levels. In the newspaper
industry, smaller organizations are moderately bureaucratic for their size, while large
organizations are relatively unbureaucratic
for their size. The larger newspaper organizations sampled were in fact national daily
publishing houses in London's Fleet Street,
which have often drawn comment (usually
critical) for operating traditional, informal,
and unsystematic modes of management
(Economist Intelligence Unit, 1966).
In short, it is possible, from a knowledge of
how many people are employed, to predict
with a high degree of confidence the broad
outlines of formal organization structure.
Nevertheless, a comparison of structure-size
regressions across different industries has indicated that a knowledge of other variables,
for which industry is undoubtedly acting as
a proxy, can also add to the predictability of
organization structure.
A MODEL OF ORGANIZATION
STRUCTURE
The conclusion that size is a major, but not
the only, important predictor of organization
structure returns us to the theoretical issues
outlined at the beginning of this article.
What are other predictors of organization
structure? Is the complexity of an organization possibly a mediating factor between the
predictors and other variables of structure?
To approach these questions, I shall try to
outline a theoretical framework in three
stages. The first stage entails a reformulation
of the Aston conception of structure, in which
complexity and bureaucratic control are now
separately distinguished. The second stage
involves an identification of the contextual
variables likely to influence the degree of
complexity in organizations. The third stage
is concerned with the relationship between
complexity and bureaucratic control, and
with the comparative status of complexity
and size as predictors of such control.

Distinguishing Complexity from
Bureaucratic Control
The conceptual distinction made here is
well established in thinking on organization,
and was alluded to in the opening to this
article. Hage, Aiken, and Hall, among others,
have distinguished between complexity and
formalization, and Blau and Schoenherr between differentiation and administration. Differentiation, especially of functions and roles,
is one major component of organizational
complexity. Another is the level and range of
specialized expertise applied to organizational activities. A bureaucratic mode of control is characterized both by formalization,
that is, use of standard procedures and documentation, and also by the decentralization
of decision making (Child, 1972). In principle, authority to make routine decisions is
delegated in a bureaucracy down to the incumbents of officially designated roles. These
roles are structured by a system of procedure
and documentation designed to limit areas
of discretion as well as to provide information on role performance.
In the following analysis, the degree of
complexity within organizations is assessed
by scores on measures of specialization and
qualifications. The specialization measures
used are functional and role specialization.
These scales do not include specialization in
workflow functions, and a measure of the
number of workflow divisions was therefore
also constructed with the intention of aggregating this to scores on functional specialization. However, while increases in workflow
divisions were related to increases in the
number of functional (staff) specialisms in

manufacturing organizations, they were not
appreciably related over the whole sample of
eighty-two organizations (r = .22). Therefore, an aggregate specialization score cannot
be used. Although the number of workflow
divisions was included in statistical analyses
as an aspect of complexity, it did not share
in any significant relationship when partialled against other variables, especially against
size with which it is correlated (r = .62 with
log. total employees).
A further indicator of complexity in organizational tasks and relationships is the presence of many different types of expertise.
The measure used for assessing expertise is
the level of specialist qualifications held by
the members of seven nonworkflow functions, where comparisons could satisfactorily
be made across different types of organization. The seven functions are research and
development, finance, quality control, workflow methods, maintenance, personnel, and
welfare. A score of 1 was registered when at
least one specialist in each function held a
relevant recognized professional qualification. Finally, the degree of bureaucratic control within organizations is assessed by scores
on overall standardization, overall documentation, and overall decentralization. Table
7 gives the correlations between (a) the
measures of complexity, and (b) the measures of bureaucratic control applied to the
National sample.

on specialization and qualifications to influence the pattern of complexity adopted for
the subsidiary. Insofar as owning groups
are larger than subsidiaries, and that size has
a positive association with complexity, then
the direction of influence of group practice
on subsidiary complexity is postulated to be
positive. Finally, the number of operating
sites is measured as a straight count.
The model postulates, in short, that the
level of organizational complexity assessed
by role specialization, functional specialization, and specialist qualifications, will be
positively predicted by (1) larger size of organizations, (2) a more integrated and automated technology, (3) a greater range of
activities contracted out, and (4) the organization belonging to a larger owning group.
The level of complexity is hypothesized to be
negatively predicted by a larger number of
operating sites, when controlling for size of
organization. These propositions were tested
on data from the National study by using
multiple regression analysis, with the results
shown in Table 8. This table shows the standardized regression coefficients (Beta coefficients) obtained for each hypothesized
predictor of overall role specialization,
functional specialization, and the level of
specialist qualifications. The standardization
of the regression coefficients allowed direct
comparisons of the relative weight that each
variable added to the prediction of complexity. Table 8 indicates that the directions of
relation between all three indicators of complexity and their postulated predictors are
as hypothesized.
All the predictors of overall role specialization attained normally acceptable levels of
statistical confidence. Size of organization
had the greatest influence in predicting levels
of role specialization, but the range of activities contracted out also had a substantial influence. Technology emerged as a fairly weak
predictor of role specialization, and this is
because the aggregative measure of overall
role specialization masked some variation in
the patterns of association between technology and role specialization in different functional areas (Child and Mansfield, 1972).
Size of organization was also the strongest

179

predictor of specialization between functional areas and of level of specialist qualifications. The size of the owning group
appeared to increase functional specialization within organizations, more than it increased the level of role specialization. The
number of operating sites did not have any
significant predictive power with functional
specialization or with level of specialist qualifications. The level of specialist qualifications was in fact only predicted by size of
organization and the contracting out of activities, although none of the coefficients for
other variables fell below one-and-a-half
times their standard errors. Almost threequarters of the total variance in role specialization was predicted by the model used, approaching two-thirds of the total variance
in functional specialization, but only 46 percent of the variance in the level of specialist
qualifications. It may be added that the
model also predicted 45 percent of the total
variation in the number of workflow divisions
in organizations; size of organization alone
accounted for 39 percent of this, while workflow integration added another 4 percent.
Larger organizations tended to have more
workflow divisions, but more technologically
integrated organizations tended to have fewer
workflow divisions.
A larger size of organizations thus appeared to be an important predictor of higher
levels of organizational complexity, in the
case of all four indicators just discussed. It
was a consistently stronger predictor in its
logarithmic form, which confirms the thesis
that the marginal effects of size decline with
increases in size. The other consistently significant predictor of role and functional specialization, and of specialist qualifications,
was the contracting out of activities, but one
cannot be sure that some increase in the contracting out was not a consequence of increased specialization and the employment
of more expert staff, rather than being solely
a prior condition. Nonetheless, with this reservation and the rather limited prediction of
variations in qualifications, we can conclude
that the attempt to supply a reasoned argument on the prediction of organizational
complexity received some support from the

greater centralization (p < .01). This result
might suggest that centralized decision
making can be maintained with a rising level
of specialization among functional areas of
work so long as those areas of work are themselves internally homogeneous and not organizationally complex. If functional areas
have high levels of internal role specialization, then the consequent complexity of relationships may encourage greater decentralization down the organizational hierarchy.
It would nevertheless be misleading to
attach too much weight to the foregoing interpretation without alluding to the question
of size. For in the National data, a progression through the sample from smaller to
larger organizations was accompanied by an
increasing ratio of role specialization to
functional specialization scores; in other
words, by increasing heterogeneity within
functional units. Thus the apparently complex relationship between specialization and
decentralization is almost certainly a reflection of the stronger relationship between size
of organization and decentralization.
When all the contextual and structural
predictors included in the model of organization structure were taken into account, the
three variables shown in Table 9 emerged as
statistically significant predictors of decen-

tralization. Size of organization was the
strongest single predictor; however, only 45
percent of the total variance in decentralization was accounted for. Other analyses of
the National data indicated that prediction
of the centralization-decentralization dimension could be improved if one takes account
of variables not considered here. For example, the degree to which control was concentrated within the hands of legal company
ownership was also relevant, since a greater
concentration of ownership and control predicted greater centralization of decision
making.
In the more limited analysis considered
here, larger size of organization and the use
of more documentation predicted greater
decentralization, while greater workflow integration was associated with less decentralization. If documentation were statistically
eliminated, then standardization replaced it
as a predictor of decentralization. These last
results confirm that decentralization to an
important extent forms part of the bureaucratic strategy of control. It seems reasonable
to speculate that larger size exerts pressures
on the administrators of an organization to
decentralize, because this makes it increasingly difficult to continue a personalized
boss style of management. The develop-

<-----Page 16----->Child: PREDICTING ORGANIZATIONSTRUCTURE
ment of standardized procedures and documentation helps to establish a system of
impersonal and indirect control instead. As
Blau and Schoenherr (1971: 136) have concluded from their study, "large size must be
complemented by conditions that improve
the reliability of operations in order to effect
official delegation of authority." However, a
highly integrated and automated workflow
technology may reduce the complexity and
variability in certain areas of decision making
and so permit the overall level of centralization to be higher than would otherwise be
the case. This interpretation, of course, assumes that most senior managers have a
preference for centralized decision making.
CONCLUSION
The results which emerged from applying
the model of organization structure to the
National data suggest the relationships summarized in Figure 4. The arrows in the figure
depict the likely directions of dominant influence. In this form, the figure presents as
yet unproven hypotheses on major organizational processes which, however, are not
apparently refuted by the data. Size of organization is seen to exert a dominant influence upon the level of organizational
complexity. Complexity levels are also seen
to be influenced by the integration and automation of technology, the number of different operating sites used, and contacts across
organizational boundaries. In regard to bureaucratic control, formalization is seen to
be primarily dependent on the level of organ zational complexity, and to be influenced
by the procedures and documentation employed in larger owning groups. Decentralization, while associated with formalization,
is consequent upon larger size rather than
upon greater complexity.
The commonly held assumption that large
complex organizations are bureaucracies was
substantiated among the eighty-two British
companies in the National study. Hall's
(1972) view that complexity is a critical factor in understanding organization structure is
borne out by the data, but not his implication
that complexity and other variables are of
more significance than size. In the organizations studied, complexity could not be satis-

183

factorily predicted or fully understood without reference to the economics and logistics of
large scale. On the other hand, it was neither
theoretically convincing nor statistically demonstrable that size in itself was the major
determinant of bureaucratic control; not at
least in regard to levels of formalization. The
specialization and expertise of employees,
presumed to denote levels of complexity in
relationships and activities, was an important
intervening variable between the context of
an organization (of which size is a key aspect) and its formalization.
Regularities are beginning to emerge from
different studies in the forms of relationships
between contextual variables and characteristics of organization structure, and also
between features of structure itself. For example, an unpublished reanalysis of the
Aston data collected by Pugh and his colleagues supports the size-complexity-formalization configuration obtained in the National
data. Blau (1972) recently reported a high
degree of consistency in relationships between size of organization, differentiation
and measures of the administrative component in six samples of different types of
organization. So far as prediction is concerned, we can feel that some progress is
being made. Blau in his work has, however,
also insisted that statistical relationships
should adequately satisfy theoretical criteria.
It has been an implicit theme of this study
that the mechanical routines of correlational
and regression analysis are applied to advantage within a previously developed theoretical framework which, however elementary,
at least attempts to create a coherent scheme
of propositions in the light of previous work.
The National study findings on organization structure and context can for the most
part be accommodated within the framework
of organization theory recently developed by
other researchers, but many problems remain. The model used in the latter part of
this article does not, for example, furnish an
adequate prediction of decentralization. The
analysis of structural variables by the industries in which organizations were located
suggested that the role of environmental variables requires further investigation. Moreover, the aggregative measures of structural

characteristics employed in this study could
be masking important variations in the types
of coordinative and control measures used
in organizations which operate under different external conditions. Such variation may,
as Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) indicated,
have consequences for performance achieved
in view of prevailing environmental characteristics. The present use of the term organization structure is for these reasons
probably too gross and indiscriminate.
Clearly, the search for understanding continues.
