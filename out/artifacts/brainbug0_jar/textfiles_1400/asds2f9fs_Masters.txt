<-----Page 2----->Abstract
Seed technology ventures require external sources of debt and equity funding, once they
have exhausted founders personal resources, to achieve their potential economic impact. The
primary source of equity finance for seed ventures is from Business Angels who invest their own
money in the company and frequently provide additional sources of assistance to the
entrepreneur. Once seed ventures have completed their business plans, however informally, they
pitch their opportunity to potential investors, However, less than three per cent of these pitches to
Business Angels are successful. It is suggested that a major reason for this low success rates is a
lack of understanding by pitching entrepreneurs of how Business Angels make their investment
decisions. Investigating how Business Angels make their investment decisions will identify some
of the causes of this high failure rate. In turn this will help to suggest ways for entrepreneurs to
increase their likelihood of successful interactions with investors.
Real-time techniques that involve observing successive interactions between five Business
Angels and 150 pitching entrepreneurs are used to gather data on the investment decisionmaking process. The technique of observational interaction has been used in psychological
research to observe interpersonal relationships and their development within the context of a
complex process. This complex process can best be understood by breaking down the process
into stages. In this research the initial interaction between entrepreneur and Business Angel is
investigated. It is found that initially the Business Angels use a filtering technique to
expeditiously reject most opportunities. This allows, allow them to concentrate their limited
resources on further investigation of a few promising opportunities that appear to offer the
highest potential return.

<-----Page 3----->The unique data set used in this research is taken from a reality TV show – CBC Dragons’
Den – where entrepreneurs participate in order to receive real investment from five wealthy
individuals known as “Dragons”. Using the video material gathered during the recording of the
show it is possible to observe how the five Dragons initially filter out most opportunities, before
looking at more positive factors when determining their interest in investing in the few
opportunities remaining. This filtering process involves a non-compensatory technique Elimination-By-Aspects, where the presence of a single one of eight potential fatal flaws is
sufficient reason for rejection. While this may not be the most accurate technique, it is the most
cost effective approach to decision-making for the investors. To increase accuracy at later stages,
the investors adopt a more compensatory decision-making approaches.
Improved understanding of the staged nature of the process, and how Business Angels
identify fatal flaws at the initial stage of the interaction, provides valuable insights to both
investors and entrepreneurs. Armed with this knowledge they can take steps to eliminate such
flaws and improve the overall efficiency of the decision making process. This in turn will lead to
an increase in successful outcomes of such interactions and consequently the number of seed
ventures that are successful in raising third-party funding from Business Angels.

<-----Page 8----->1. Introduction
Business Angels (BAs) are private investors who provide “risk capital directly to new and
growing businesses in which they have no family connection” (Mason and Harrison, 1996, page
153). BAs fund 30 times as many early stage ventures as corporate investors, known as Venture
Capitalists (VCs) and are important catalyzers of the economic activity stimulated by new
venture creation (Sohl, 2007). However, most of the interactions between fund-seeking
entrepreneurs and BAs lead to failure, with less than 3% leading to an investment (Mason and
Harrison, 1994; Riding, et al. 1997). Researchers, such as, Freear et al. (2002), Mason and
Harrison (2002) and Riding et al. (2007) suggest that this high failure rate is because the current
investment process is inefficient, and call for research to identify opportunities for process
improvement.
Prior research suggests that the investment decision-making process comprises a number of
stages before the final decision to invest, or not, is reached (Feeney et al., 1999; Harrsion et al.,
1997). However, as Landström (1998) identifies, most studies only look at a single stage of the
process and fail to place each stage within the overall context of the investment decision.
Specifically, Landström suggests future studies should consider “investment as a process in
which decision-making criteria may vary in the course of time” (1998, page 322). Riding et al.
echo this suggestion and note “there remains considerable room for research on the nature of the
investment process itself” and “how the various decision criteria are weighted at different points in
the process” (2007, page 335). Our research is a response to both suggestions.

Research on the decision-making process has been constrained by two factors, previous
data has focused on collecting data from the end of the overall process, rather than at each stage
of the process; secondly most research has gathered data on factors that lead to a positive
1

<-----Page 9----->investment decisions rather than gathering data on the causes of failure (Wiltbank, 2005). Riding
et al. (1997) identify the causes of such limitations, noting that part of the problem is because
observing BA decision-making processes is difficult. Investor-entrepreneur interactions are
usually geographically dispersed (Landström, 1995) and essentially private in nature (Mason and
Harrison, 2000). Where data has been gathered, it relies on investors’ post-decision recollections,
making it difficult to isolate intermediate effects (Svenson, 1979), and compensate for the biases
introduced by investors’ recollections (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). Further, most data that has
been gathered has been from opportunities that received investment, This limits the possibility
of identifying causes of failure in the decision-making processes and identify opportunities for
process improvement (Sharma and Mahajan, 1980).
In this paper, I focus on the first stage of the interaction between entrepreneur and investor
in the investment process – the selection stage where measurable failure rates are highest
(Riding, et al., 1997). During this stage, I follow the insights of Mason and Harrison (2002) who
suggest that investors use a time efficient decision-making process to filter out most
opportunities so they can devote more time to the few opportunities that best meet their
investment criteria. These observations lead to my research questions: During the first stage of
the investment decision-making process, what factors do Business Angels consider when
deciding which opportunities should be rejected? Are these factors the same as those used by a
Business Angel to make their final decision to invest or not?
Using observational interaction techniques to overcome the constraints identified in prior
research, and access to a rich data set that includes both successes and failures, I confirm the use
of eight critical non-compensatory factors used by investors to reject opportunities at the
selection stage of the process. In our sample, the failure of an opportunity to reach a minimum
standard in any one of these critical factors leads to rapid rejection of the opportunity, thus the
2

<-----Page 10----->term ‘fatal flaw’. This decision-making technique greatly reduces the number of opportunities to
be considered at subsequent process stages, allowing the investor to devote more time for further
investigation to each opportunity that has not been rapidly rejected. However, while the absence
of these critical factors is highly predictive of the filtering stage of the process, there is no
evidence that the presence of the same factors is able to predict funding. This suggests that BAs
consider additional factors to these eight, before making their final investment decision.
I proceed as follows.

First, I provide a background on extant research on the BA

investment decision-making process and raise concerns about the biases and constraints of prior
research. Using insights on the staged nature of the investment process and adaptive decisionmaking techniques, I propose the filtering technique used by BAs during the selection stage of
the process and suggest eight critical factors used to differentiate between continuing to engage
in the evaluation of a particular opportunity and the decision to reject it. I confirm that investors
identify the presence of a single fatal flaw as a cost-effective filtering technique based on our
observations of 50 interactions between entrepreneurs and investors who participate in a Reality
TV show. The use of a real-time approach, that gathers and records data while the event is taking
place, allows some of the identified biases to be overcome, and a rich data set collected that
provides both qualitative and quantative insights. This technique allows each of the stages in the
overall process to be observed and provides insights into how BAs adapt their decision-making
techniques at different stages in the process. Analysis of this data set provides insights into
entrepreneurial behaviours in this context and how the information exchanges with the potential
investor can increase or reduce the likelihood of an opportunity moving to the next stage of the
investment process. I conclude this paper by suggesting some direct implications for
entrepreneurs fro our research and then outlining how this research can contribute both
theoretical and practical insights that might stimulate future research in this area.

<-----Page 11----->2. BA investment decisions
High growth-potential companies often require additional equity financing. However, the
percentage of such ventures able to attract third party funding is low (Riding, et al., 1997). This
is traditionally attributed to the fact that either many ventures are not ready for investment or
there is a lack of available risk capital.

Mason and Harrison (2002) challenge this view,

suggesting there are inefficiencies in the investment decision-making process that limit the
number of ventures funded. They propose that improved process understanding will reduce the
number of failures in interactions between entrepreneurs and investors, an insight that this paper
builds on.
Most research that attempts to understand the BA decision-making process usually starts
by assuming that BAs make their investment decision in an identical manner to VCs. This
assumption often occurs because, it is assumed that VCs are professional experts in this area and
therefore they must make better decisions. In addition, there is an assumption that VCs constitute
the major source of funds for new ventures. It is also considerably easier to collect VC
information than BA data due to the increased accountability VCs have to their funders for their
decision-making processes. Recent research, for example by Van Osnabrugge (2000), in
examining the differences between BA investment decision-making and that of VCs identifies
several causes of these differences.

The most important factors being the differences in

objectives and expectations that exist between BAs and VCs and the fundamental difference in
roles of each set of investors, due to differences in agency relationships -– BAs invest their own
money, while VCs invest funders’ money. The increased level of VC accountability affects both
their decision-making criteria and decision justification.
VCs are also not the largest funders of seed ventures. In fact, BAs rather than VCs
dominate the early stage of venture funding, investing more money and about 30 times more
4

<-----Page 12----->frequently (Sohl, 2007).

As Sapienza et al. (1996) note, this is partly a function of the

investment expectations of VC funds, which encourage VCs to invest in later stage opportunities,
where liquidity events are sooner and perceived risk levels lower. It is also a function of the
important coaching role that BAs can undertake, an investment in time which is more
challenging for VCs due to their need control their management expense ratios. The relative
importance of BAs as a source of early stage finance is also noted by Madill et al., (2005) who
observe that pre-existing BA funding is a pre-requisite for VC investment in 90% of cases. The
importance of BA investments, current low interaction success rates and incomplete
understanding of BA decision-making processes, motivate this research. As Mason and Stark
(2004) suggest, recognizing how BAs, VCs and banks differ in their decision-making processes,
will allow entrepreneurs to respond appropriately to each one and increase the likelihood of
success in each case.

2.1 Factors considered by BAs when making their investment decisions
Research on BA investment practices dates back to the early eighties when Wetzel was
motivated to understand the importance and demographic characteristics of BAs in a specific
regional context - New Hampshire, U.S.A (Wetzel, 1981). Further demographic research was
carried out by: Haar, et al. (1988) in the U.S.A., Mason and Harrison (1995) in the U.K. and
Riding, et al. (1993) in Canada. These studies conclude that BAs are: wealthy males who had
direct startup experience and invested in local ventures. To explain BAs’ motivations and
behaviors, DalCin, et al. (1993) attempted to better understand their psychological attributes
concluding that BAs have a high internal locus of control and need for achievement.
Research on the characteristics of BAs has now been extended to help explain their
investment decision-making processes (Feeney et al., 1999; Sudek, 2006). This research looks at
5

<-----Page 13----->factors considered by BAs and the decision-making process itself. Specifically positive factors
BAs consider when making a decision to invest identified in prior research are summarized in
Table 1 (Bachher and Guild, 1996; Feeney et al., 1999; Haar et al., 1998; Haines et al., 2003;
Landström, 1998; Paul, 2007; Sudek, 2006; Van Osnabrugge, 2000). Product, market and
entrepreneur are all important categories in the decision-making process, as are the financial
potential of the business and the investment terms (Sudek, 2006). Specific individual factors
frequently mentioned as being of high importance include: an identifiable barrier to future entry,
the presence of a large and growing market and evidence of a sustainable business model. In the
Table, very high positive ratings are indicated by +++, high positive ratings by +++ and positive
ratings by +++.
Differences in the nature of each factor can affect how the BA assesses it, for example,
some of the factors are objective - such as number of years of relevant entrepreneurial experience
or the date a patent was issued. These can be rapidly and easily determined. Others are more
subjective, such as entrepreneurial trustworthiness or investment-fit and take longer to assess.
Much of the previous work that identifies the relative importance of these factors ignores how or
when in the process, each factor is assessed. Despite our observations about agency differences
affecting the decision-making process, there are few obvious differences between the factors
considered by BAs and VCs. This is apparent when comparing our analysis of BA factors with a
similar summary of factors considered by VCs compiled by Zacaharakis and Meyer (1998, page
61), shown in the Appendix.
Importantly, Feeney et al. (1999) and Mason and Harrison (2003), note the absence of
certain factors linked to the rejection of a specific opportunity. These negative factors, also
shown in Table 1, include: entrepreneur experience, prototype availability, patent protection and

<-----Page 15----->projected profitability (Harrison et al., 1997), product attractiveness and market conditions
(Feeney et al., 1999), and relevant entrepreneurial experience or a growing market opportunity
(Riding et al., 1997). In fact compared to the positive factors, Harrison et al. (1997) note that
these negative factors can be fatal, such that their absence immediately eliminates an opportunity
from further consideration. For this reason I call them ‘fatal flaws’.
I also include in Table 1 an assessment tool developed by the Canadian Innovation Centre the Critical Factor Assessment. This assessment tool, based on the product development work of
Cooper (1994), uses eight critical factors that are both positively and negatively correlated to
long term business potential – but not directly to investment potential. The identification of so
many factors is confusing to the entrepreneur trying to make sense of the relative importance of
each positive and negative factor. I suggest that at the initial stage of the investment decisionmaking process, the eight factors identified in the Critical Factor Assessment are the most
important, with other factors of relatively smaller importance or considered at alternate stages in
the process. How and when each factor is considered is discussed further in Section 3.

2.2 The BA investment decision-making process
Researchers have identified the staged nature of the investment decision-making process,
suggesting different decision-making activities occur at each stage. The general model includes a
stage that occurs before the interaction between investor and entrepreneur takes place, the
interaction itself and the stage once the investment has been made. In Figure 1, I show three
models of the BA investment process (Duxbury et al., 1997; Paul et al., 2007; Riding et al.,
1997) alongside two classic VC investment models (Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Tyebjee and
Bruno, 1984). The first formal model of the BA process was developed by DalCin, et al., (1993)
and reveals all three phases of this linear model, which include both the pre and post interaction
8

<-----Page 16----->stages: (a) identification, (b) screening (c) diligence, (d) negotiation, (e) deal consummation and
(f) venture management. It is this model that was expanded by Riding et al. in 1997, when substages in both the identification and screening stages of the process were added. An
complementary approach was developed in 2000 by Van Osnabrugge, that has recently been
confirmed by Paul et al. (2007) based on interviews with 30 BAs.
The pre-interaction stage of the process - identification, occurs when trusted third parties
refer a limited number of fund-seeking entrepreneurs to a specific interested investor (Fried and
Hisrich, 1994). Amatucci and Sohl (2004) note that it is difficult to obtain a first meeting with
the investor without a referral from an individual with a high reputation. The BA will also likely
consider the nature of the business, and the track record of the entrepreneur before agreeing to
meet.

<-----Page 17----->At the next stage, the first part of the interaction process itself, the investors uses a
screening or selection process to filter out most opportunities with limited business potential –
based primarily on the information provided by the entrepreneur. This avoids the investor in
wasting time on opportunities with limited business potential. During the next stage of the
process - evaluation or assessment, the potential business value and investment risk of the
opportunity are determined. Some of the decision-making models refer to this stage as diligence1
because the investor validates the information provided by the entrepreneur based on his prior
knowledge and access to third party information. This process also requires the BA to expend
effort in interpreting the validated information and using it to complete an initial assessment of
the future value of the venture and the perceived risks faced both by the venture and their
investment in it. The investor then modifies his or her valuation and risk assessment of the
venture and investment based on a combination of direct experience and their availability of
complementary assets. If this modified assessment of risk and return meets their investment
criteria, he or she will make an offer to invest that includes a valuation and a shareholder
agreement that structures the proposed working relationship. Subsequent to investment, both
parties work together to manage the growth of the business, before identifying and agreeing an
appropriate liquidity event.
Both Paul et al. (2007) and Riding et al. (2007) point out that these process models are
simplified and do not reflect the iterative nature of the process. They note that viewing the
process as a linear progression does not reflect its complexity or that opportunities can become
stuck at various stages. As Riding et al. suggest “there remains considerable room for research on
the nature of the investment process itself.” They go on to recommend the use of models from other

1

We confine the use of the term diligence to a more expensive part of the consummation process that takes place
once an agreement to invest has been made. It involves outside assistance from accountants, lawyers or
technologists to verify factual claims made during the interaction by the entrepreneur (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).

10

<-----Page 18----->disciplines that posit “how individuals arrive at decisions,” noting that this issue does not yet “appear
to have been considered with respect to business angels” and conclude there is a need to study “how
the various decision criteria are weighted at different points in the process” (2007, page 336). This

research responds to these suggestions.
2.3 Identifying and addressing the limitations of prior research
Prior research that relies on data gathered from investors’ post decision recollections,
limits our ability to understand how and when each factor is considered in the overall decisionmaking process. Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) observe further problems in relying on investors’
recollections, noting investors do not always themselves understand how they make decisions instead relying on “gut feel”. Shepherd and Zacharakis (1999) also identify another problem
when relying on investor’s recollections - the introduction of confirmation seeking and outcome
or hindsight biases.
Confirmation seeking bias occurs because an investor may justify his previous decisionmaking process by interpreting information in a way that confirms his preconceptions (Mynatt et
al., 1977). As a result, an investor tends to provide reasons to defend his previous decision rather
than trying to recollect the actual decision process he or she used at the time. Outcome or
hindsight bias occurs when the decision-maker reflects on his decision once the outcome of that
decision is known (Baron and Hershey, 1988). Retrospective data gathering allows an investor to
modify recollections of how a decision was made based on outcome information obtained
subsequent to the decision-making process rather than solely on information he knew at the time.
This is a particular issue in decision-making under uncertainty. At the time of the decision there
were future risks and uncertainties that subsequently may be perceived as being more predictable
than they were (Fischhoff and Beyth, 1975). As a result, an investor tends to remember what he
or she thought would happen more strongly if those predictions end up being correct. The
11

<-----Page 19----->combined effect of these biases increases the likelihood that decision-making explanations do not
reflect the actual decision-making process that was used.
Selection bias causes another problem that limits understanding of factors that affect
negative and positive decisions. Most research data is gathered from companies that receive
investment, rather than companies that do not. This limits researchers the ability to identify
factors that differentiate between success and failure. For example, it is difficult to use
entrepreneurial confidence as a diagnostic decision-making tool, as suggested by Sudek (2006),
when Astebro et al. (2007) find evidence that too much confidence is often linked to failure. To
fully understand the role of each factor in the decision-making process, it is necessary to better
understand its differential impact on success or failure. However, collecting data from companies
that fail to attract funding is challenging. Many of these companies do not survive - so accessing
information subsequent to the event is difficult. Even in cases where decision-makers who did
not invest are identified, it can be hard to understand their real reasons for their decisions.
Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest real-time data gathering techniques can overcome these
constraints and biases. These techniques record data while the interaction progresses allowing for
subsequent analysis and observation of detailed process. The collection of this type of data set,
which includes both successful outcomes and failures, provides an opportunity to identify
diagnostic factors that differentiate between the two. It also facilitates an understanding of when
in the overall decision-making process each factor is considered and how the investor gathers
data about each of the factors of interest.
Verbal protocol analysis, described by Ericsson and Simon (1984), is the most commonly
used real-time technique first applied to VC investor decision-making by Sandberg, et al. (1988).
Mason and Stark (2004) used the same technique to record BA’s thoughts about the investment
decision-making process. The use of this technique addresses some of the validity concerns
12

<-----Page 20----->identified but does not eliminate several of the identified biases because it still relies on
investor’s recollections. Outcome bias can be reduced using concurrent verbal protocol analysis,
where the investor records his or her thoughts while making the investment decision. However,
recording these insights in real-time can inhibit the actual interaction (Kuusela and Paul, 2000).
Alternatively, if the investor uses verbal protocol analysis post-interaction, by referring to tapes
or transcripts, he or she can again impose outcome or confirmation-seeking biases. An
alternative approach, designed to remove these biases has been experimentation, with
participants playing the role of either investor or entrepreneur (Cable and Shane, 1997).
However, experimental techniques may contain hypothetical responses that reduce external
validity, as they cannot replicate the entrepreneur’s attachment to the idea, emulate the real risks
involved or place the interaction as the first step in the development of a long-term relationship. I
conclude that a better research method is the use of third party trained observers to gather and
analyze information exchanges and participant behaviours in an environment, with real risk and
the knowledge by participants of the long-term implications of any negotiated agreement. This
approach is known as observational interaction (Gottman, 1998).

13

<-----Page 21----->3. Hypothesizing the investment decision-making model
The nature of the interaction between entrepreneur and investor, like similar complex
negotiations, proceeds through a number of stages, with behaviours evolving as the parties move
from one stage to the next (Adair and Brett, 2005). I suggest that investment decision-making
can be broken down into a number of stages where the investor adapts his decision-making
technique at each process stage. Based on the investor’s previous investment experience he or
she selects the most cost-effective technique to use at each stage, starting with one technique
which he or she has developed based on previous experience and then changing this technique at
subsequent stages in the process as the nature of the context changes. This research focuses on
the selection stage of the process, when the BA is faced with evaluating a large number of
potential investment opportunities. At this stage the investors chooses a decision-making
technique that minimizes his or her required effort per opportunity to rapidly reject most
opportunities, while limiting the chance of discarding one of high potential. This elimination of
most opportunities from further consideration allows him or her to focus a much greater level of
attention on the remaining opportunities of greater interest. At these subsequent stages, when
most unsuitable opportunities have been filtered out, the investor changes his decision-making
technique to identify positive reasons to invest.

3.1 The investment decision-making process
Payne, et al. (1993) define decision-making as taking and then processing several pieces of
information in order to reach a conclusion. They note the effort required by the decision-maker is
a function of: the number of pieces of information considered, their complexity and the context
in which the decision is made. They suggest that individuals break down complex decisions into
a series of stages and choose the most cost-effective decision-making technique to use at each
14

<-----Page 22----->stage - where cost-effectiveness is a function of effort and level of accuracy required. A decisionmaker, faced with making similar decisions over time, will use heuristics to choose his decisionmaking techniques, although the choice of technique used can also be influenced by the
investor’s need to justify his decision-making to others. A summary of the primary decisionmaking techniques developed by Payne et al. (1986) is provided in the Appendix, which also
shows a figure that identifies the relationship between effort in decision-making and accuracy of
decision.
Shepherd et al. (2005) note the time constraints placed on VCs that limit the amount of
time they can spend evaluating new investment opportunities. BAs are also time constrained, as
they often undertake their investment activities on a part time basis and have to balance
management of their existing portfolio and other responsibilities with the identification of new
opportunities (Mason and Harrison, 2002). Payne et al. (1993) identify one of the most common
filtering technique deployed at an early stage in a selection process is Elimination-By-Aspects
(EBA) first noted by Tversky in 1972. While EBA is often the most cost effective initial
decision-making technique, it does not always provide the most accurate outcomes. The fact that
investors are willing to use it implies they are willing to trade off a reduced effort requirement
for a less accurate outcome.
In explaining EBA, Tversky (1972) suggests that it is different from the traditional view of
multi-factor decision-making where important factors in each opportunity are assessed and the
one with the highest weighted average of all factors is selected. This compensatory approach
allows a high score in one factor to compensate for a low score in another. In contrast, EBA uses
elimination criteria to reject unsuitable options. This reduces the need to assess each factor or
determine its relative importance, because as soon as a single ‘fatal flaw’ is identified the
interaction is terminated. To use EBA, decision-makers first consciously or sub-consciously
15

<-----Page 23----->identify critical factors and then determine a minimum standard for each. Any opportunity that
fails to meet this minimum standard for any factor is determined to have a ‘fatal flaw’ and
rejected. This non-compensatory technique means that the presence of a single ‘fatal flaw’
cannot be compensated for by other positive factors.

3.2 Identifying fatal flaws and critical factors
Critical factors in either the entrepreneur or opportunity must be easy to measure and must
be objective – that is their presence will be readily agreed between different assessors. In
addition, the absence of certain of these critical factors, termed fatal flaws must also be easy to
assess minimum standards where absence is highly correlated to business failure. If critical
factors are to be used as a diagnostic then high scores should be positively correlated to business
success and low scores to business failure. Important critical factors include: company sales
revenue, patent status and entrepreneur work experience. Despite the opportunity for some
subjective interpretation of these objective factors, if the inter-rater reliability between trained
observers comparing assessments of these factors is high, then we can confirmed the objective
nature of these factors.
The use of objective diagnostic tools and the ease with which the associated factors can be
determined facilitates their use early in the decision-making process. At later stages in the
process, subjective factors, such as perceived risk and expected return, can also be considered
(Fried and Hisrich, 1994). These subjective factors require more effort by the investor to assess
and quantify and are based on the investor’s expert knowledge: increasing the likelihood that
individual investors will assess them differently. Factors considered later in the process are
compensatory, where a high score in one factor can compensate for a low score in another factor

16

<-----Page 24----->(Muzyka et al., 1996). For example, higher expected levels of return can compensate for a higher
level of perceived risk.
To provide a starting point for the assessment of the investment decision-making process,
an existing business diagnostic tool was chosen – the Critical Factor Assessment. This tool was
developed by the Canadian Innovation Centre and considers factors that are both diagnostic and
objective (CIC, 2006). Over thirty years, the Canadian Innovation Centre has deployed this tool
looking at more than 10,000 innovations, in order to determine their business potential and
provide a diagnostic too to interested parties. The Critical Factor Assessment tool uses eight
factors, where not achieving a minimum standard in any one of the eight factors creates a fatal
flaw linked to failure. In addition, high positive scores in each factor are correlated to business
success. In 2004, Astebro validated the predictive ability of this tool by comparing 561 initial
assessments of market potential with product launch outcomes five years later. In his sample,
very early stage entrepreneurs accessed the federally funded Innovators Assistance Programme
operated by the Canadian Innovation Centre to predict their likelihood of market success (not
venture funding).

Astebro (2004) verified the predictive accuracy of the Critical Factor

Assessment, comparing forecasts of success and failure against actual product entry in the
market. He noted that the Critical Factor Assessment’s overall predictive accuracy was 79.1% 74.2% accurate at predicting successful product launch and 79.7% accurate at predicting failures
to launch the product. Given the lead-time between the study and the outcome measurement (five
years), and the many implementation issues that can inhibit potentially successful products from
reaching the market, this predictive accuracy is very high. As Astebro (2004) himself notes in the
study the Critical Factor Assessment has about twice the predictive accuracy of professional
VCs.
The eight critical factors detailed in Table 2, look primarily at product and market factors.
17

<-----Page 25----->The presence of each factor is linked to market success, while the absence of each factor is
directly correlated to failure. Within the eight factors three are product related factors: adoption –
how easily will potential users adopt the product, development stage – is a high level of
technology development still required, and protectability – is there a barrier to entry for potential
competitors. Three market factors are included: customer engagement – does the product meet a
real need, route to market – is there a realistic route to market, and market potential – is there a
sufficient market to provide an interesting opportunity. In addition, there is one factor about
relevant entrepreneurial experience, and one about the realism of the financial projections of the
company.

<-----Page 26----->3.3 Hypotheses
I have suggested that during the selection process the investor, based on his or her time
constraints and the number of presented opportunities, will be encouraged to use the costeffective EBA decision-making technique as initial filtering tool. If this is the case then during
the selction stage of the process the investor will be looking to identify the presence of a fatal
flaw in any one of the critical factors to enable him or her to rapidly reject unsuitable
opportunities. Although not necessarily conscious of their use of this technique, investors will be
willing to sacrifice a small level of accuracy for a substantial reduction in effort. If the investor
cannot find a reason to reject an opportunity because of the presence of a single fatal flaw, he or
she will allow the opportunity to be considered further at the next stage of the decision-making
process.

Hypothesis One: The presence of a single fatal flaw in a venture seeking funding will cause
the investor to reject it as a potential investment opportunity.

Certain limitations have been identified with the use of EBA as a decision-making
technique. EBA is a filtering decision-making technique that identifies the failure of each
opportunity to reach a minimum standard in any one of a limited number of factors to be
sufficient reason for rejection. This technique limits the accuracy of decision-making because it
does not allow trade offs that a more compensatory approach might. However, investigating such
factors and trading them off against each other, is something that the investor does not have the
time undertake with each opportunity. The investor thus adapts his or her technique, subsequent
to the initial filtering technique to utilize alternate decision-making techniques that consider
19

<-----Page 27----->additional factors to the initial critical ones and uses a compensatory approach to trade off
between each. I suggest that there are several stages in the decision-making process before the
final decision to invest, or not, is made – as shown in the Appendix. At each subsequent stage of
the decision-making process, it seems likely that the investor further adapts his decision-making
process and considers additional factors. It would thus seem logical that while the eight factors
considered at the selection stage are used in the decision-making process, these factors alone can
not predict the final investment decision.

Hypothesis Two: For those opportunities not rejected at the selection stage there will be no
correlation between their Critical Factor Assessment score and the final investment
decision.

20

<-----Page 28----->4. Research Methods
Three primary constraints in previous research have been found to limit validity:
recollection biases, selection bias and post decision data collection. These reduce the ability of
previous researchers to provide insights that can improve funding success rates. The research
methodology selected is specifically designed to overcome these potential biases in order to
provide more reliable process insights. The use of real interactions between entrepreneurs and
investors, which embed real risk and long-term relationship development during the interaction,
will improve validity.
The choice of enhanced real-time approach - observational interaction requires that
interactions between entrepreneurs and investors are first video-taped and then coded by
independent trained observers prior to extracting the data for analysis. This methodology not
only facilitates the interpretation of negotiation behaviours and information exchanges, it also
allows individual interaction examples to be extracted for review and illustration. Observational
interaction relies on the assessment of interactions based on exhibited behaviours and
information exchanges, rather than on recollections of what happened. Careful analysis of
several interactions can provide deeper insights than participants’ recollections alone. The use of
trained observers enables a less partisan view of relationship development and facilitates the
observation of factors that the participants themselves may be unaware (Gottman and Notarius,
2000). This is particularly valuable, as most previous research has gathered data based
exclusively on investors’ perceptions, which can limit the ability to draw reliable conclusions
from the data set. In addition, the pitfalls of selection bias are avoided by using a data set where
the majority of interactions result in failure. This provides valuable insights into diagnostic
factors that differentiate between success and failure instead of the more traditional approach of
identifying factors linked to success. Real-time data collection techniques also allow the relative
21

<-----Page 29----->importance of each factor to be investigated and the mechanisms for assessment better
understood. In addition, the use of this technique at subsequent stages of the decision-making
process allows an improved understanding of the factors considered change and the investor’s
decision-making techniques adapt.

4.1 Context
Our entrepreneur-investor interactions consist of a series of negotiations between five BAs
and 50 entrepreneurs taking part in a Canadian Reality TV show – CBC Dragons’ Den. In the
show, unrehearsed interactions between entrepreneurs and the group of five investors are
recorded, with the expectation that the BAs, known in the show as Dragons, invest between
$10,000 and $500,000 in a few selected opportunities. In season two of the show (2007), 150
entrepreneurs were selected from over 1500 applications to present in the ‘Den’, and their
interactions were recorded in CBC’s Toronto studios in May and June, 2007. Dragons’ Den is
the property of Sony Corporation and is a globally syndicated reality TV show that is currently
recorded and shown in ten countries. The show has a standard format, in which selected
entrepreneurs pitch their business opportunities to five Dragons, who during the interaction must
decide either to invest in a business or provide a reason for rejecting each opportunity.
Entrepreneurs from across the country were encouraged to apply to participate in the show,
with initial selection completed through regional or online auditions. Auditioning entrepreneurs
and their businesses varied enormously in terms of experience. Some of the businesses were still
at the idea stage, while others had several hundred thousand dollars in revenues. Entrepreneurs
participating were motivated by their need for money, the desire to gain access to experienced
entrepreneurs resources or simply to benefit from displaying their product on national TV. The
150 entrepreneurs who were invited to the “Den” to make pitches for money were selected in one
22

<-----Page 30----->of two categories, their likelihood of gaining investment, or their entertainment value. The
audition process ranked every opportunity in both categories and this data was used in
subsequent analysis to determine which opportunities should be included the sample set of 50.
Interactions were standardized in terms of format and context. The entrepreneur started by
stating her2 name, the nature of the proposed business and the amount of capital required. The
Dragons would then quiz the entrepreneur on details of the business and her experience with the
aim of deciding whether or not to make an investment offer. If an offer was made a negotiation
followed during which the entrepreneur had the opportunity to reject, accept or counter the offer.
This iterative negotiation process continued until either both parties agreed on the investment
terms, or the entrepreneur or all five investors walked away.
Overall the Dragons rejected most opportunities, some rapidly and others after a more
prolonged interaction. When each Dragon withdrew, he or she was required to provide a specific
reason for the rejection of that opportunity.

Under the TV show’s rules, each Dragon,

individually or in syndication with the other Dragons, had to invest at least the original amount
requested by the entrepreneur, or there was no deal. However, once the investment amount was
offered the percentage of equity exchanged for this investment was subject to intense
negotiation.
Actual interactions recorded in the show mirrored standard entrepreneur – BA interactions
found in other less public environments. Line tapes of these interactions were used for this
research on the process rather than the edited versions used for broadcast content. Line tapes are
single continuous recordings of the live interaction that includes several camera angles as well as
comments made between the Dragons after each interaction. Availability of these line tapes gave

2

In the paper we will use the female form to denote the entrepreneur as we note that in 2001 in Canada more than
47% of SMEs are owned or part owned by women, with the percentage of women entrepreneurs increasing each
year (Statistics Canada, 2002).

23

<-----Page 31----->observers the opportunity to examine and re-examine process interactions, extracting
increasingly sophisticated levels of data for subsequent analysis.
4.2 Data gathering techniques
To confirm or deny our hypotheses data had to be gathered on: the stage of the decisionmaking process when each interaction terminated, the funding decision for each opportunity and
its Critical Factor Assessment score. The Critical Factor Assessment score was used to both
identify the presence of a fatal flaw, and to rate the overall likelihood of each opportunity’s
commercial success.
The stage of the process at which the interaction terminated was measured by observing
how the information exchanges between the parties changed as the interaction continued.
Specifically at early stage in the process – selection, most information exchanges between
entrepreneur and investor were objective. However, as the interaction proceeded to subsequent
stages, information exchanges became subjective and required greater effort by both
entrepreneur and investor to interpret. The change in the ratio of subjective to objective
information exchanges was then used to determine the stage of the process and to identify
specifically at which stage each interaction terminated.
The process for measuring the relative subjectivity or objectivity of each interaction was
first determined based on the approach of Kim and Myaeng (2007) who looked to determine
objectivity in artificial intelligence systems. Using this framework, each statement made could be
broken down into objective, subjective or indeterminate, and a ratio between the level of
objectivity and subjectivity at each point determined. This ratio could then be compared to
observations of interactions, where independent trained observers established the correlation
between this ratio and the stage of the interaction.
Using a sample data set of 20 opportunities from season one of Dragons Den to avoid
24

<-----Page 32----->using the research data set influencing the coding, interactions were transcribed and analyzed
based on the subjective or objective nature of the information exchanges. Each two-minute
segment was examined and the ratio of objective to subjective interactions determined. Most
initial interactions were objective (company name, nature of product, why the product was
developed, entrepreneurs experience) but became increasingly subjective (perceived need,
market opportunity, competitive advantage) as the interaction progressed. Ten season one
opportunities were initially evaluated and for the three that passed the selection stage the level of
subjective versus objective statements measured. This stage was determined to be reached when
the percentage of objective interactions fell below 85% ± 2% (i.e. one was at 87%, one at 85%
and one at 83%). This process was then repeated with the data set from ten more season one
opportunities. It was found that 85% was a good benchmark for predicting when the two
opportunities passed the selection stage from the second sample. 85% was then adopted as the
benchmark for objectivity, when the level of objectivity in interactions fell blow this level, it was
determined that the interactions had passed the selection of the process in the real data set.
The Critical Factor Assessment score was for each opportunity was determined on three
separate occasions, each by a different observer. The high inter-rater reliability obtained between
the Critical Factor Assessment scores undertaken by the three observers, confirmed the reliability
of the assessment tool. Observers were trained by the Canadian Innovation Centre using
reference data from season one, where trainees were introduced to the Critical Factor Assessment
process and then analyze a sample of opportunities. These observers were either graduate
students or recent graduates from business and technology programmes at universities in
Southern Ontario. Variations in the score of each factor were discussed, with the intent that the
trainees and the trainer could come to a consensus score for each factor for each opportunity. The
exercise was then completed with another set of samples and the category inter-rater reliability
25

<-----Page 33----->assessed. If this was found to below 90%, then a discussion ensued and the training process was
repeated. Once the inter-rater reliability exceeded 90% before any discussion between the trainee
and the trainer, the training was determined as complete. Trainees were permitted to annotate the
A, B and C Critical Factor categories (explained in Table 2) with + and – to allow them to
discriminate between opportunities, however only the basic A,B, and C ratings were used in the
training process as class inter-rater reliability was found to be of much greater significance than
absolute scores (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979).
The Critical Factor Assessments on each opportunity were undertaken at three different
times. The first observer used information provided by the entrepreneur before or during the
audition process; the second observer used the line tape of the interaction, while the third
observer used the TV edited version. Each observer completed his or her review before the
outcome of the interaction was known. The most important consideration was the identification
of a C grade in any factor that corresponded to a fatal flaw. A and B grades were combined
mathematically (using the numeric factors listed in Table 2) and this number used to determine
the combined average Critical Factor Assessment score. Average Critical Factor Assessment
scores were rounded to correspond to a letter equivalent as part of the entrepreneur feedback
process. When a particular factor score for an opportunity was not obtained - due to the absence
of relevant information, these results were excluded from the averaging process.
Basic information was recorded about each opportunity: nature of the business, industry
sector, revenue position, amount of money requested, and initial valuation, and the entrepreneur:
sex, age, experience, and commitment. If the company received a funding offer, additional
information was also recorded: valuation on funding, percentage ownership in the company
taken by the investor/s and which specific BAs participated in the investment.

26

<-----Page 34----->5. Results and analysis
Initial evidence was found that both confirmed and illuminated the findings of previous
research. Overall, the ability to extract qualitative and quantitative data and re-examine it for
analysis confirmed the benefits of using observational interaction techniques. Further, the quality
of the analysis that could be performed addressed many concerns raised about context validity.
Focusing the research on the early stage of the process allowed selection criteria to be identified,
decision-making techniques observed and participant behaviours noted, in each case linked to
either rejection or less frequently to a continued interaction. Observing the first stage of a
complex process also allowed the identification of future opportunities for extending this
research, both into considering other factors and to investigating decision-making techniques at
future stages of the investment decision-making process.
The high failure rates of entrepreneurs looking for BA funding that had been noted by both
Feeney et al. (1999) and Mason and Harrison (1994) was consistent with the results noted in this
research. Out of 1500 entrepreneurs auditioned, only 150 met the investors and nine received
funding offers. The staged nature of the process was also confirmed, and the change in the nature
of the interaction as it continued observed, becoming more subjective and complex as the
interaction progressed. The recent observations of Paul et al. (2007) and Riding et al. (2007),
who noted the high rejection levels at each stage of the process were also confirmed as was the
fact that on occasion the decision-making process was both non-linear and iterative, rather than
the simpler staged approach originally modeled. In some cases, it was observed that a stage was
revisited several times before progress to the next stage was allowed, in other times there were
cases when a stage was completely skipped. It was also observed that as the interaction
progressed the nature of the interactions between each individual entrepreneur and the investors
could develop in different ways. The differences in how these interpersonal relationships
27

<-----Page 35----->developed was quite dramatic - especially at the stage where valuation and shareholder
agreements were discussed, echoing Gardner’s (1992) observation that the process of raising
finance is a dramaturgical process, with both the entrepreneur (actor) and investor (audience)
interpreting the business plan (script) based on previous perceptions and experiences.

5.1 Hypothesis confirmation
Although 150 entrepreneurs met the Dragons, 100 of these were eliminated from the
analysis as being of limited interest. There were two primary reasons for such eliminations –

the audition) or he or she was eliminated from serious consideration by the investors early in the
interaction. Only the 50 entrepreneurs who had longer intensive interactions were selected for the
actual broadcast. Each interaction was edited for TV to between three and six minutes, while 36
shorter opportunities were also aired in 10 to 20 second slots for their "TV entertainment” value.
These were excluded from the data sample. All 50 opportunities that aired are included in the
data sample, a summary is provided in Table 3 with full details in the Appendix, which includes
every opportunity that passed the selection stage, and all that received funding offers.
The three Canadian Innovation Centre trained assessors completed the Critical Factor
Assessment score for each of the 50 opportunities in the data set. Scores were converted to a
numerical value, averaged and rounded. Inter-category rater reliability was high (95%)
confirming the objective nature of these eight factors. The presence of at least one fatal flaw in
34 of the opportunities was noted and all of these opportunities rejected during the selection
stage. No fatal flaw was noted in 16 of the opportunities, this allowed them to proceed passed the
selection stage of the process - although only nine of these opportunities would go on to attract
funding.

<-----Page 37----->As shown in Table 4 the distribution of fatal flaws in each opportunity shows that 79% of
the 34 rejected opportunities had four or more fatal flaws based on the observers’ assessment.
This validated the predictive accuracy of the Critical Factor Assessment tool and was confirmed
by the Dragons who in each case identified the same fatal flaws as reason for rejection (noting
that the Dragons missed some flaws as some opportunities were rejected before the Dragons had
chance to review every factor). Other factors were also linked to an investor losing interest, such
as an unrealistic valuation by the entrepreneur. However, this was rarely a reason for early
rejection. Instead, either the Dragons identified an alternate fatal flaw or valuation became an
issue at a later stage in the process.
As shown in Table 5, the Dragons rejection every opportunity that contained a fatal flaw
confirming that this was a 100% reliable technique for predicting whether or not an opportunity
would be rejected at the selection stage of the process. This provided initial confirmation of
hypothesis one - the presence of a fatal flaw would stop an investment from proceeding, while
the absence of a fatal flaw would allow an opportunity to continue to the next stage of the
process.

technique, it is important to verify that compensatory decision-making techniques do not produce
the same result. As the Critical Factor Assessment is a compensatory decision-making technique
that has previously been validated and correlated to business success, using the positive scores
derived from the assessment should also be an indicator of whether or not a specific opportunity
can pass the selection stage of the decision-making process. However, as the Critical Factor
Assessment score is a compensatory decision-making technique, where low marks in one factor
can compensate for higher marks in another, our first hypothesis would suggest that using it in
this way, rather than looking for the presence of fatal flaws, would be less accurate.

The compensated Critical Factor Assessment score for each opportunity was correlated
against the stage at which each was terminated. As shown in Table 6, although this assessment
was found to be 94% accurate, it was less accurate than the EBA technique using the same
critical factors. The compensatory technique was more accurate at predicting when the Dragons
decided not to allow a specific opportunity to proceed to the next stage of the interaction (97%)
than when they chose to allow it to continue (88%). This is in part due to the high negative
correlation between the Critical Factor Assessment scores and the presence of multiple fatal
31

<-----Page 39----->flaws. The 100% reliability of the EBA fatal flaw technique confirms our first hypothesis that at
the selection stage of the process, the non-compensatory EBA technique is used.
The purpose of this research was to identify the nature of the decision-making process
undertaken by investors during the selection stage of the decision-making process. An existing
Critical Factor Assessment was used to confirm the use of EBA as the decision-making
technique used based on the identification of fatal flaws. However, it is not clear that the eight
factors that from the Critical Factor Assessment are all required. Given the high incidence of
multiple fatal flaws in a single opportunity, identified in Table 4, there is a high likelihood of
redundancy between these factors. A more detailed test of independence was undertaken, to see
if the presence of one fatal flaw could predict the presence of another and found that none of the
factors are completely independent.
It is possible that some of the eight factors might be redundant, and a model with fewer
factors would be just as successful in predicting selection. This is suggested by a number of
follow up analyses on the data. First, the individual scores on each factor are highly correlated as
portrayed in Table 7. Redundancy is also suggested by the fact that there is usually more than
one fatal flaw in an idea as highlighted in Table 3, which shows, by idea, whether or not the idea
was selected to move beyond the first stage and how many fatal flaws that idea had. Finally, tests
of independence show that almost none of the factors are completely independent of the others.3
These analyses all suggest that a smaller set of critical factors may be sufficient in predicting
success in the selection stage. However, as the sample is small (n = 50), these tests of
independence do not have as much power as they would have in a larger sample. It is therefore
too early to claim that fewer than the full eight factors would be sufficient. In addition, there may
be other factors, that should also be considered, that did not emerge because of the small sample
3 Independence of factors would be shown by the likelihood of occurrence of one fatal flaw not be affected by the
presence of another flaw. For all factors except factor 3, the hypothesis of independence of factors is rejected.

<-----Page 40----->size.
The correlation of factors, shown in Table 7, also provided some insights into fatal flaws
that were often linked. The most obvious of which was that the absence of previous
entrepreneurial experience was significantly correlated to multiple fatal flaws, and highly
correlated to financial projections (0.86). This indicates that prior experience – whether
successful or not_- helps entrepreneurs avoid some of the basic business flaws identified.

To confirm the second hypothesis it was necessary to show that factors considered during
the selection stage of the process cannot predict the final investment decision. The Critical Factor
Assessment score for each opportunity was used to study if there was a correlation between these
scores and the final investment decision. The Critical Factor Assessment tool’s reliability as a
predictive tool for the final funding decision, as seen in Table 8, drops to 84%, and its ability to
predict successful outcomes is only 44%. The high accuracy levels to not fund are mainly due to
the high negative correlation between the Critical Factor Assessment score and the presence of
fatal flaws.

To eliminate the opportunities already rejected at the selection stage from our analysis a
logistic regression was performed to establish the correlation between the Critical Factor
Assessment score for those remaining opportunities and the funding decision. The correlation at
0.004 is statistically non-significant4. It is therefore possible to confirm that each Dragon must
consider alternate factors before making his or her final investment decision.

5.2 Additional observations
The use of observational interaction as a research technique facilitated the capture of
additional qualitative insights. On several occasions the negative effect on the investor if the
entrepreneur provided an unrealistic valuation was observed. In addition if the entrepreneur
presented certain information during the interaction that he or she either contradicted later or the
BA knew to be incorrect, then the likelihood of investment seemed to be reduced. BAs also
seemed more interested in products they could use or relate to, and also had a preference for
businesses that had large market potential. In many cases, existing customers seemed to be a pre-

<-----Page 42----->requisite for gaining investment. Certain entrepreneurial attributes created a favourable
disposition in one or more investors with specific BAs relating more easily to an entrepreneur
because of a similar background or life experience. The importance of first impressions was also
noted - based on the entrepreneur’s appearance or the quality of the presentation: confirming
Clark’s (2008) observations on the importance of impression management.
Observations were also made that might illuminate some of the conflicting data obtained in
prior research, specifically around the role of investor’s domain expertise (McMullen and
Shepherd, 2006) and the importance of the entrepreneur’s commitment (Prasad et al., 2000).
There is conflicting evidence that shows investors more likely to invest in areas in which they
have domain expertise. From the observations obtained in this research, I noted that an investor
with specific domain expertise took a higher level of interest in opportunities in his or her
domain. This led to him or her initially being more critical of an opportunity in this domain, and
thus more willing to reject these ventures. However, if, after his or her critical appraisal, he or
she found a venture he or she liked he or she became more willing to invest in it. On these
occasions, other Dragons were heavily influenced in their decisions by the actions of the BA
with perceived domain expertise.
Entrepreneurial characteristics such as commitment (approximated as the percentage of the
entrepreneur’s net worth invested in the business) were noted as being of interest to Dragons.
Although there is research that entrepreneurial commitment is of importance in the investment
decision, high levels of commitment seemed to be present in most of the entrepreneurs seeking
funding. However, there was no evidence that higher levels of commitment were linked to
success in obtaining investment; in fact, high levels of commitment could also be correlated to
failure. On several occasions, entrepreneur’s commitment was perceived negatively, with
Dragons instructing them to “Stop the madness” or “I forbid you to continue in the business”.
35

<-----Page 43----->Commitment cannot be used as a diagnostic tool as it can not predict the difference between
success and failure.

5.3 Limitations and validity concerns
The use of a reality TV show creates questions about the validity of the data and its
subsequent analysis (Hight, 2001). The main validity concerns in comparison to standard
entrepreneur – investor interactions are that the context was unrealistic, interaction timescales
were compressed, deal structures were inflexible and external references could not be verified
during the interaction. While all these concerns affect the validity, I believe that their overall
impact was limited. For example, while the context was somewhat artificial, none of the
interactions were predetermined or the outcomes scripted. In fact, the Dragons had no knowledge
of an opportunity until the entrepreneur walked into the “Den”. The intent of the negotiation was
for investors to fund presenting opportunities and the interaction dynamics that were observed
between the parties were similar to other investor – entrepreneur interactions in less public
domains5.
The compressed time-scale meant that a final investment decision was reached in less than
an hour, whereas normal investment processes usually take a series of meetings. In the traditional
investment process, entrepreneurs are only invited to a subsequent meeting if they pass through
the previous stage of the process (Mason and Harrison, 2003). In examining the selection stage
of the process, I found that the interactions replicated accurately the normal time allowed for
selection stage meetings, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions for this part of the process.
I believe that the compression of time-scales could be more of an issue when studying
subsequent stages of the interaction. However, if the compressed time scales is seen as the

opportunity – the content of the feedback usually provided a legitimate insight into reasons for non-investment.

36

<-----Page 44----->imposition of a crisis into the investment decision-making process, I can concur with the insights
of Mishra (1996) who suggests that viewing this interaction in a crisis-situation allows us to
obtain valuable insights into underlying behaviours.
Although limits on deal structures reduced the number of ventures funded - for example
debt investments were not allowed, the need to agree valuation, investment amount and postinvestment control, created a valuable dynamic between the entrepreneur and the investor that
highlighted many of the challenges of BA investing. The generally high levels of risks in the
investment decision were exacerbated by the investor’s inability to access referrals and
references before making their decisions (Amatucci and Sohl, 2004). As a result, each Dragon
had a tendency to rely more on his or her prior experience and only to use third party validation
to verify information once the deal had been concluded in the “Den”. This subsequent stage in
the process had the effect of causing a few deals that had been completed in the “Den” to be
revoked after proper diligence. On balance, I conclude that the observed interactions mirror
normal BA – entrepreneur interactions in less public environments, and provide a depth of
insight and examples that would otherwise be unavailable.

37

<-----Page 45----->6 Conclusions
The research methodology and unique sample set allowed me to observe behaviours of
entrepreneurs and investors involved in a funding negotiation that involved both risk and the
intent to develop a long-term relationship. The use of objective real-time measurement
techniques, with no knowledge of outcomes at the time of coding, allowed some of the
constraints and biases of prior research to be reduced. This facilitated an improved understanding
of the investment decision-making process, allowing me to identify opportunities for process
improvement. When observing the whole process its staged nature became apparent, allowing
me to focus in detail on the selection stage of the process.
Hypothesis one was confirmed; that the presence of a single fatal flaw in a venture seeking
funding causes the investor to reject it as a potential investment opportunity. This allowed me to
suggest that the non-compensatory EBA decision-making technique was used, and validate the
use of the eight factors from the Critical Factor Assessment technique as being appropriate to
identify the presence of fatal flaws. Given our small sample size and the correlation between
factors I am not in a position to suggest that the number of factors should be reduced, although
there was, without doubt, a level of redundancy in the eight factors used. This confirmed some
general observations about the importance of these factors, for example that limited
entrepreneurial experience would also be linked to the presence of other fatal flaws.
Hypothesis two was also confirmed; that for those opportunities not rejected at the
selection stage - there was no correlation between their Critical Factor Assessment score and the
final investment decision. This both confirmed that a non-compensatory technique was used at
the selection stage and that the absence of fatal flaws alone could not predict a positive
investment decision. It thus appears, additional factors to those analyzed using the Critical Factor
Assessment, are considered by the investor when making their final investment decision.
38

<-----Page 46----->These findings bring several important insights to the BA investment decision-making
process. I confirmed the staged nature of the process and the use of different noted decisionmaking techniques at each stage. Importantly the elimination process is used at the selection
stage of the process, to reduce the number of opportunities to a more manageable number for
further investigation. The identification of several critical factors that can lead to fatal flaws
provides specific insights to entrepreneurs seeking investment. Some ides on how entrepreneurs
can address the presence of each of the flaws is provided in the Appendix.

6.1 Theoretical implications
I hope that those interested in understanding investment decision-making will appreciate
the benefits of using trained observers and real-time observational techniques to break down a
complex process into stages. The use of this technique provided unbiased data that leads to
qualitative and quantative insights on the decision-making process without affecting the
interaction. It provides an interesting technique that can be used to further explore the investment
decision-making process and other issues in behavioural economics. Confirmation of the staged
model of the investment process will facilitate the development of a common process framework
that will help address the need to understand “the nature of the investment process itself” and the
“various decision criteria” (Riding et al., 2007, page 336).

I believe that paying more attention to causes of failure, will allow researchers to identify
opportunities for process improvement that will be easier to implement than simply replicating
success factors. Learning from failures is a classic quality improvement approach can be applied
to complex decision-making processes in an effort to increase interaction efficiencies and the
percentage of successful outcomes. I believe that much previous research in this area has noted
causes of failure, but not fully appreciated how these insights can be used.
39

<-----Page 47----->6.2 Practical implications
My research findings also have practical implications. I identified the eight critical factors
that lead to early rejection. I suggest that an entrepreneur’s awareness of each factor can help her
address potential fatal flaws and identify specific remedial action. In addition, simply by
understanding specific factors of concern to investors, he or she will focus appropriate attention
on communicating relevant information on these factors to potential investors.
To confirm the value of understanding these fatal flaws, I organized a training session with
participants in season three of Dragons’ Den - taped in June 2008. I provided participating
entrepreneurs three webinars that identified and explained the eight critical factors and made
suggestions how to address each one. In addition, as noted in the Appendix, I was also able to
provide guidance on how to address some of the overall negative factors that had been observed
to cause failures at each stage of the process. During the subsequent taping of season three of
Dragons’ Den, while 30% more entrepreneurs participated, I noted that the number of
entrepreneurs who received funding offers more than doubled and the amount proposed to be
invested tripled. When surveyed by Canadian Innovation Centre staff, 85% of the successful
entrepreneurs confirmed that the content of the webinars had been helpful in structuring their
presentations and understanding the needs of the Dragons.
The use of the Critical Factor Assessment tool can be extended into other areas. Its use as a
teaching tool for entrepreneurs has been observed, it can also be used in a classroom
environment for courses in entrepreneurship, where the role of BAs and his decision-making
processes is not well understood. In addition, due to its objective nature and the ease an
individual can be trained in its use, it can be used as an online filtering tool for those applying for
funding to BA networks or early stage VCs.
40

<-----Page 48----->6.3 Suggestions for future research
I used observational interaction methodologies and a rich data set to draw lessons from the
selection stage of the investment decision-making process. I believe that I can use this research
methodology to investigate subsequent stages in the decision-making process as well as the final
investment decision. Importantly I believe that this approach not only provides insights on other
factors that are considered during the interaction but also how the relationship between the
entrepreneur and the investor develops to facilitate a positive investment decision. This
technique can also be used to answer related questions raised in other research in more detail,
such as the role of expertise, personality and experience in both the entrepreneur and investor. I
am aware of the importance of procedural justice, trust and culture in negotiations. I believe that
using alternate analysis tools I can investigate these issues in more detail – for example,
Dragons’ Den is now syndicated in ten countries some of which have expressed an interest in cooperating on our research. It might be interesting to explore the differences in information
exchanges and observed behaviours and the outcomes of the decision-making process in
countries with different cultures.
I hope that others will join us in using observational interaction to gather and share data
about investment decision-making in the context of a staged model so that further improvements
can be made overall process understanding. It is expected that this improved understanding will
identify further opportunities to increase the efficiency of the investment interaction and reduce
the high current rates of failure. It is hoped that these improved insights will also identify
structural ways policy makers can improve interaction efficiencies. This will lead directly to
more outcomes that are positive for entrepreneurs and investors, both during the funding
interaction and as partners in long term venture success.

<-----Page 55----->Adaptive Decision Making Techniques (Summary of Payne et al., 1988)
In their paper on adaptive decision-making Payne et al., (1988) identify ten basic decisionmaking strategies that vary substantially in the amount of information used and in the way it is
used to make a choice.

1. Weighted Added Compensatory Process
The most information intensive strategy examined was a version of a weighted additive
(WADD) compensatory process, which can be thought of as a version of expected value
maximization. The strategy considers the values of each alternative on all of the relevant
attributes (outcomes) and all of the relative importances (weights or probabilities) of the different
attributes (outcomes) to the decision maker. The rule develops a weighted value for each
attribute by multiplying the weight (probability) by the value and sums over all attributes to
arrive at an overall evaluation of an alternative. The rule selects the alternative with the highest
evaluation. It is often used as a criterion for decision effectiveness in multi-attribute choice
(Zakay & Wooler, 1984).

2. Random Choice Rule
The random (RAN) choice rule, in contrast, chooses an alternative at random with no
search of the available information, providing a minimum baseline for measuring both accuracy
and effort.

In addition to these two baseline rules, six choice heuristics and two combination strategies
are available.
48

<-----Page 56----->3. Equal weighted
The equal weight (EQW) rule examines all alternatives and all attribute values for each
alternative. However, the rule ignores information about the relative importance (probability) of
each attribute. In some contexts, the equal weight rule has been advocated as a highly accurate
simplification of the risky choice process (Thorngate, 1980).

4. Elimination By Aspects
Elimination by aspects (EBA) (Tversky, 1972) begins by determining the most important
attribute (the outcome with the highest weight [probability]. Then, the cutoff value for that
attribute is retrieved, and all alternatives with values for that attribute below the cutoff are
eliminated. The process continues with the second most important attribute, then the third, and so
on, until one alternative remains.

5. Majority of Confirming Decisions
The majority of confirming dimensions (MCD) rule (Russo & Dosher, 1983) involves
processing pairs of alternatives. The values for each of the two alternatives are compared on each
attribute, and the alternative with a majority of winning (better) attribute values is selected. In the
case of an equal number of winning values for the two alternatives, one version of this rule
retained the alternative winning the comparison on the last attribute. The retained alternative is
then compared to the next alternative among the set of alternatives. The process of pair-wise
comparison repeats until all alternatives have been evaluated and the final winning alternative
identified.

49

<-----Page 57----->6. Satisficing
The satisficing (SAT) rule (Simon, 1955) considers alternatives one at a time, in the order
they occur in the set. Each attribute of an alternative is compared to a cutoff value. If any
attribute value is below the cutoff value, that alternative is rejected. The first alternative, which
passes the cutoffs for all attributes is chosen, so a choice can be made before all alternatives have
been evaluated. In the case where no alternative passes all the cutoffs, a random choice is made.

There are two versions of the lexicographic choice rule:

7. Lexicographic
For the strict lexicographic (LEX) rule, the most important attribute is determined, the
values of all the alternatives on that attribute are examined, and the alternative with the best
value on that attribute is selected. If there are ties, the second most important attribute is
examined, and soon, until the tie is broken. Because the simulation generates attributes as
continuous random variates, ties almost never occur.

8. Lexicographic Semi Order
The lexicographic semi-order (LEXSEM) rule (Tversky,1969) is similar to the strict
lexicographic rule, but introduces the notion of a just-noticeable difference (JND). If several
alternatives are within a JND of the best alternative on the most important attribute, they are
considered to be tied. The potential advantage of the LEXSEMI rule is that it ensures that an
option that is marginally better on the most important attribute but much worse on other

50

<-----Page 58----->attributes will not necessarily be selected.

There are also two combined strategies that are commonly observed in studies (Bettman &
Park, 1980):
9. Elimination-by-aspects plus weighted additive (EBA+WADD) rule.
This rule uses an EBA process until the number of available alternatives remaining was
three or fewer, and then uses a weighted additive rule to select among the remaining alternatives.

10. Elimination- by-aspects plus majority of confirming dimensions (EBA+MCD) rule.
This rule uses an elimination-by-aspects process to reduce the problem size, and then a
majority of confirming dimensions heuristic to select from the reduced set.

These choice strategies differ on a number of aspects, such as the degree to which the
amount of processing is consistent or variable across attributes or alternatives, the pattern of
processing (alternative based or attribute based), and the total amount of processing. The various
strategies represent different combinations of these aspects. The weighted adding strategy uses
consistent and alternative-based processing and examines all available information. The equal
weight strategy uses consistent and alternative-based processing but uses a subset of the
available information. The MCD rule is consistent, attribute-based, and ignores weight
information. The EBA rule implies a variable (selective) pattern of processing that is attribute
based. The total amount of information processed by EBA depends on the particular values of
the alternatives and cutoffs. The lexicographic strategies are also selective and attribute based,
and the satisficing strategy is selective and alternative based. The total amount of information

51

<-----Page 59----->processed is also contingent upon the particular values of the alternatives for these strategies. As
illustrated in the figure below, each of these alternative decision-making techniques requires
different levels of effort. It is noted that increasing levels of effort in decision-making result in
greater levels of accuracy in the decision.

Specific Recommendation
Identify a trusted referrer who can facilitate investor introduction and provide
then with some guidance of venture and entrepreneurial quality
Ensure that you understand the investment preferences and prior investment
experience of the Business Angel before a meeting.
Ensure that initial impression created builds credibility and reinforces the
opportunity
Ensure business addresses each of the critical factors identified – if there are
critical flaws develop a specific strategy to overcome them
Demonstrate how the investor will make their ROI and identify liquidity event for example identify potential acquirers.
Be prepared to show forecast revenues and profit can be reached to justify venture
valuation
Show BA participation in the venture can reduce performance risk - through their
complementary assets or domain expertise
Identify how interests of investor and entrepreneur can be aligned and the
existence of successful prior relationships
Show how the invested money will be used, the logic behind your valuation and
flexibility but not weakness in the negotiation. Value the BA’s contribution.
Show an understanding of how the relationship will develop and the importance
of fit.
