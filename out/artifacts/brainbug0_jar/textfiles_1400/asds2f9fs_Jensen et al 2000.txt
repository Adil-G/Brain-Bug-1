Abstract
Although various strategies for forming design teams have been documented in the literature,
there continues to be a need to assess these established strategies as well as to propose new ones.
In the present study the development of a new team formation strategy based on the “Six
Thinking Hats” of Edward DeBono is described. An instrument for categorizing students
according to their “Six Hats” preference for group interaction as well as the strategy for using
this data to form design teams is presented. In order to determine the validity of this 6-Hats
categorization instrument, the students provided feedback on the accuracy of their “6-Hats”
preference for group interaction. This information indicates that the instrument used to assign a
6-Hats communication style works well; with 84% of the students reinforcing that their 6-Hats
“type” is indeed one of their preferred styles of group communication. To further assess the 6Hats method of design team formation, teams formed using this new method are compared with
teams formed using a Myers Briggs based formation technique. As the two different team
formation techniques have slightly different goals, this assessment incorporates both sets of goals
as well as some generic measures of design team effectiveness. The results indicate that the
teams formed using the 6-Hats based strategy more completely meet the 6-Hats goals than do the
non-6-Hats based teams. Similarly, the MBTI based teams meet the MBTI based goals better
than do the non-MBTI based teams. Also of interest is the fact that the teams which meet both
the 6-Hats and the MBTI criteria for team formation report increased effectiveness in every
category when compared with teams who meet either the 6-Hats or the MBTI criteria, but not
both. More data is required to provide definitive, statistically significant results (this data is
currently being taken), but the initial results indicate that this new team formation strategy has
significant promise.
I.

Overview

Various researchers [Wilde 1993, 1997, 1999, Trevistan 1998, 1999]have investigated different
techniques for forming and assessing design teams. Although progress has been made in both
the formation and assessment areas, there are still significant questions to be answered. The
present work presents a new approach in both design team formation and the assessment of these

<-----Page 1----->teams. This work was done at the United States Air Force Academy in the fall semester of 1999
using two sections (about 50 students) of the sophomore level mechanical design class. Further
data is being gathered in an additional eight sections (about 200 students) of a
freshman/sophomore level Introduction to Mechanics course. Specifically, a new design team
formation strategy (TFS) based on the work of DeBono [DeBono 1985] called the “6 Thinking
Hats” has been developed. In addition, an assessment strategy has been developed which
compares the new 6-Hats TFS to a Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based TFS.
The 6-Hats work of DeBono describes six ways of thinking/interacting. DeBono’s primary
thrust in his work was to provide ways to enhance communication by identification of these
different communication styles or roles with the idea that, once a style/role is identified, it
becomes easier to switch into that style/role when needed. The new 6-Hats based TFS, which is
the focus of this paper, takes the 6 different styles/roles identified by DeBono and uses them in a
completely different manner. Specifically, the 6-Hats based TFS has two parts. Initially it uses
a 30 question survey to rank the student’s preference for using each of the six communication
styles/roles. This preference order is referred to as the student’s 6-Hats “type” in much the same
way as a student has a Myers Briggs “type”. Secondly, the 6-Hats based TFS uses each student’s
6-Hats type to form design teams using a simple algorithm. This algorithm is based on the 6–
Hats TFS goals as seen in Table 1 below. The details of this process are given below in the
Section II: 6-Hats Based Team Formation.
In much the same way, students in this study were given a form of the MBTI test. To this end,
the Keirsey instrument was used [Keirsey 1984,1999]). As with the 6-Hats TFS, the MBTI types
were used in accordance with a simple algorithm to form MBTI based design teams. This
algorithm is based on the MBTI TFS goals as seen in Table 1 below. Details of this process are
given below in Section III: MBTI Based Team Formation.

Two types of assessment were accomplished in this present work. First, in order to verify that
the survey utilized to derive a student’s 6-Hats type is accurate, an instrument was used to obtain
feedback from each student by directly asking them to rank which of the 6 styles/roles they use
the most when interacting with their team. Secondly, an instrument was developed to gage team
effectiveness in a number of specific ways. This instrument was used both on 6-Hats based

<-----Page 2----->teams and MBTI based teams. The goal here was obviously to determine if one TFS provided
superior team effectiveness. Results are correlated with the specific TFS goals shown in Table 1.
The results of these assessments as well as additional details regarding the assessment
instruments themselves can be found in Section IV: Results.

6-Hats Based Team Formation

II.1

Overview of the 6 Hats Concept

As previously mentioned, the original 6-Hats work of DeBono [DeBono 1985] had a different
focus than this current work. In the original work, six communication styles/roles were
identified. Each style/role was identified by a certain color. When a person was using that
particular style/role, they were said to be wearing that “hat”. The six styles/roles are summarized
in the Table 2.
In the original 6-Hats work, there were five purposes for identifying these 6 communication
styles/roles: 1) Helps in role playing, 2) Helps focus attention on seeing things from a new angle,
3) Provides an easy way to ask someone to switch gears and think a different way, 4) Using the 6
hats may help develop new neural patterns in your brain (thus making it easier to think in
different manners than you were previously used to) and 5) Can be used to establish “rules of the
game” for brainstorming. The current work focuses on the use of these 6 styles/roles in a
different manner. The idea in this present work is simply that each individual has established
patterns of communication which can be identified using the 6-Hats categories. Once these
preferred communication styles/roles are identified, they may be used in a design team
formulation strategy (TFS) to both balance communication styles/roles as well as to ensure
certain styles/roles are present. In order to accomplish this, two tools needed to be developed: 1)
an instrument to identify a person’s preferred communication styles/roles within the 6-Hats
framework (called their 6-Hats “type”) and 2) an algorithm to use this data to form design teams.
Together these two tools constitute the 6-Hats TFS.

The 6-Hats Based Team Formation Strategy (TFS)

The first tool in the 6-Hats TFS is the 6-Hats “typing” instrument which is used to determine a
person’s relative preference for each of the 6 styles/roles designated in the previous section (i.e.
find their 6-Hats “type”). The instrument used to determine a person’s 6-Hats type is shown in
Appendix I. It is written in Microsoft Excel and contains 30 questions. The instrument is
emailed as an attachment to each student in the course(s). Students email back the completed
instrument. A separate Excel spreadsheet is used to score the instruments. Of the 30 questions
on the instrument, 5 are dedicated to each of the 6-Hats types. These 5 questions attempt to
ascertain the student’s preference for functioning within that particular 6-Hats style/role. The

<-----Page 4----->students’ numerical answers on these 5 questions therefore indicate his/her preference for that
style/role. The scoring spreadsheet computes an average and standard deviation over the full 30
questions and then computes the average of the 5 questions pertaining to each of the 6
styles/roles as individual entities. This data is easily manipulated to produce the number of
standard deviations above or below the mean for each of the 6 styles/role for each student. The
resulting 6 numbers that represent the student’s preference for interacting using these 6
styles/role constitute that student’s 6-Hats “type”. Both the 6-Hats instrument and the scorer
spreadsheet are available by simply emailing the primary author at dan.jensen@usafa.af.mil.
Once each student has been designated a 6-Hats type (consisting of the 6 numbers derived as
described above), that data is used to place students on teams. The algorithm for doing this has
four simple steps as shown below in Figure 1. The criteria in all four steps must be met for a
team to be designated a “6-Hats Team” (i.e. a team formulated using the 6-Hats TFS).

1. Place a student on the team who has “Green” as their primary 6-Hats type
2. Place a student on the team who has “Yellow” as their primary 6-Hats type
3. Place a student on the team who has “Black” as their primary 6-Hats type
4. Place a student on the team who has “Blue” as at least their second 6-Hats type

Figure 1 – 6-Hats TFS Algorithm
The rational behind this particular algorithm can be seen by considering the specifics on the
green, yellow, black and blue styles/roles as shown in Table 2. The green style/role represents
creativity. This is obviously a critical style/role for someone on the team to posses. Therefore,
the first criteria in the 6-Hats TFS algorithm is a predominately “Green-Hat” member. As can be
seen in Table 2, the yellow and black style/roles represent opposite methods for providing
feedback on new ideas. The yellow style/role provides positive feedback and encouragement to
proceed with an idea while the black style/role provides constructive criticism and adds needed
realism to potential ideas. This justifies the number 2 and 3 criteria. Finally, the blue style/role
represents the leadership functions needed in a design team. Big picture perspective and overall
problem definition are parts of this style/role. This motivates the fourth criteria in the 6-Hats
TFS algorithm. Note that the red and white style/roles are not used in the 6-Hats algorithm.
Although it would be preferable to have a mix of red and white style/roles on a team, due to the
team size being 4 members, it becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy additional criteria.

MBTI Based Team Formation

III.1

Overview of the MBTI concept

Use of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) data for purposes of improving engineering
courses has been investigated by various researchers including the current author [Jensen 1998,
1999, Borchert 1999, Wilde 1999, 1997, 1993]. McCaulley et. al. in conjunction with the Center

<-----Page 5----->for Applied Psychological Type have determined MBTI type for thousands of engineering
students at various universities. This data has been analyzed for application to student learning
as well as for possible use in career counseling and student retention strategies [McCaulley 1990,
1983, 1976]. Other examples include using MBTI to develop self instruction materials [Smith
1973], using MBTI comparisons between freshman and senior students to determine the change
in preference brought about during the four years of engineering curriculum [Rodman 1986] and
work which has shown the potential to increase academic success of struggling students by
strengthening their non-preferred areas [Rosati 1993].
The present work uses what is known from MBTI type preferences and their affects on group
communication in order to guide continuing improvements in design team formation. The MBTI
type includes four categories of preference [Myers1985, Jung 1971, Keirsey 1984, 1999]. The
four letter combination of these indicators (“E” vs. “I” for extrovert and introvert; “S” vs. “N”
for sensor and intuitor; “T” vs. “F” for thinker and feeler; “J” vs. “P” for judger and perceiver)
constitute a person’s MBTI “type”. Table 3, which is adapted from Manual: the Myers-Briggs
Type Indicator [Myers, McCaully 1976], gives a brief overview of the four MBTI categories.

The MBTI Based Team Formation Strategy (TFS)

As with the 6-Hats based TFS, the process of forming teams using the MBTI based approach has
two basic steps: 1) Determination of the MBTI type and 2) Use of the MBTI type in an algorithm
to form the teams. In the first step, each student’s MBTI type must be determined. In order to
accomplish this, the web based version of the Keirsey instrument has been used in this study.
This instrument can be found at http://www.keirsey.com . There are two different tests on this site.
The 36 question test “Keirsey Temperament Sorter” has been used for this work. In addition,
this site scores the test and has a wealth of background resources.
Once the students’ MBTI types are determined, an algorithm is used to form the teams. Five
specific criteria make up the MBTI team formation algorithm as shown in figure 2. All five of
these criteria must be met for a team to be categorized as an MBTI-based team. Refer to Table 3
for explanations of the MBTI categories.

1. Either put an “Extroverted Intuitor (EN)” on the team or as a secondary option,
put an “Introverted Intuitor (IN)” on the team and assure that someone else on the
team is an “Extrovert”.
2. Make sure there is a “Judger (J)” on the team.
3. Make sure there is a “Perceiver (P)” on the team.
4. Make sure there is a “Thinker (T)” on the team.
5. Make sure there is an “Feeler (F)” on the team.

Figure 2 – MBTI TFS Algorithm
The logic behind these five criteria can be seen by referring to the description of the MBTI
categories in Table 3 above. Criteria 1 attempts to ensure that the simplest MBTI version of a
“creative” person (“Intuitor”) ends up on the team and that their creative ideas are expressed
(“Extrovert”). Note that the literature contains detailed work done to correlate MBTI and
creativity [Thorne] and, in that light, criteria 1’s description of creativity is extremely basic. The
mix of criteria 2 and 3 attempts to ensure that the team will be mixed between those who are
ready to make decisions on limited data (“Judger”) and those who want to fully consider ALL
the options before making a decision (“Perceiver”). Criteria 4 and 5 are designed to create a mix
between those who make decisions by concentrating on facts and logical relationships
(“Thinker”) and those who allow insight and intuition to play significant roles (“Feeler”).
IV.

Results

The results for the present work have two separate goals. The first goal is to validate the 6-Hats
typing instrument itself. This is done through a survey given to the students which simply asked
students which 6–Hats category best describes their dominant style/role on their team. The
results of this survey are shown in the next section. The second goal of the assessment process is

<-----Page 7----->to measure the effectiveness of the 6-Hats and MBTI based design teams. These results are
shown in section IV.2 below.
IV.1

Assessment of the 6-Hats instrument

As mentioned above, the first goal of the assessment process is to validate the newly created 6Hats typing instrument. This instrument (See Appendix 1) was created through a detailed review
of the original 6-Hats work of DeBono [DeBono 1985]. Key characteristics of each of the 6
styles/roles were identified. These characteristics were used to form the 30 items on the
instrument. Each of the 6 styles/roles is directly correlated to 5 specific items on the instrument.
For example, the first two items on the instrument state 1) “Focus on objective facts” and 2)
“Have my feelings sway my decisions”. These are critical parts of the “White” and “Red” hat
style/roles respectively. The other 28 questions are similarly correlated with the various 6
styles/roles.
In order to validate this instrument as a reliable way to assign a student a 6-Hats “type”, an
additional survey instrument was developed which requests information from the students
pertaining to the style/roles they prefer to use when working in their groups. This validation
instrument is shown in Appendix III. On close inspection, it can be seen that there is a close
association between the typing instrument in Appendix I and the validation instrument in
Appendix III. This is by design. In contrast to the original typing instrument, the validation
instrument has the complete list of characteristics of each 6-Hats style/role in a single list.
At the beginning of the course, the students each completed the original typing instrument.
Toward the end of the course the students completed the validation instrument. Note that the
algorithm used to assign students to groups (see figure 1) uses only the student’s most dominant
6-Hats style/role for fulfilling criteria 1-3 and then uses the student’s most dominant and second
most dominant style/role for the fourth criteria. Therefore, the primary question pertaining to
validation is whether the dominant style/role, as described by the original typing instrument, is
identified by the validation instrument as a truly dominant style/role. Correlation between the
original typing instrument and the validation instrument shows that the style/role identified by
the original typing instrument as dominant for that particular student was later rated, in the
validation instrument, as one of their preferred style/roles 84% (see Table 4) of the time. This
indicates that the original typing instrument does a reasonable job of correctly identifying the
students’ preferred style/roles of interacting with their groups. The details of these results are
shown below in Table 4. Notice from Table 4 that the percentage of students selecting the exact
same style/role in the validation instrument as was identified in the original typing instrument
was 42%. The percentage of those whose selected 2nd or 3rd dominant style/role was identified as
their primary style/role in the original typing instrument was 23% and 19% respectively. This
means that those who whose selected 4th, 5th or 6th style/role was identified as their primary
style/role in the original typing instrument was only 16%.

Another way to view this data is to compute the mean and standard deviation of each student’s
rankings from the original typing instrument. From this data, for each of the 6 styles/roles the
number of standard deviations above/below the mean can be computed. These numbers (called
“style/role strengths” below) provide a measure of the strength of each style/role for each person.
A secondary mean and standard deviation can be computed across these 6 “styles/roles
strengths” for each person. By definition, the mean of these “style/role strengths” must be zero.
In order to use this data to measure the validity of the original typing instrument, the style/role
selected as primary in the validation instrument is correlated with its corresponding “style/role
strength” to determine its number of standard deviations above the secondary mean (of zero).
Once this has been computed for each student, a percentile can be obtained from Gaussian
distribution. The computed percentile is 78%. This is the percentile correlation between the
primary style/role as selected in the validation instrument and the respective “style/role strength”
as computed from the original typing instrument.
IV.2

Assessment of the Two Different TFS

The second goal of the assessment process is to measure the effectiveness of the 6-Hats and
MBTI based design teams. In order to accomplish this, the instrument called the Team
Effectiveness Survey shown in Appendix II is used. Of the 15 questions on the instrument, 5 of
them relate to goals specified in the 6-Hats TFS; 6 relate to goals specified in the MBTI TFS and
6 are general questions relating to team effectiveness. Note that 2 questions specifically relate to
goals of BOTH the 6-Hats and MBTI TFS. Question 1, 3, 6, 9 and 15 measure goals of the 6Hats TFS. Questions 1, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 15 measure goals of the MBTI TFS and 2, 4, 5, 12, 13
and 14 measure general team effectiveness issues. This is summarized in Table 5 below.

In order to derive overall team effectiveness measures, scores from the individual students on
each team are averaged to provide a team-based score for each of the 15 questions. Using these
team scores, and noting which questions correlate with which TFS’ goals, separate averages can
be obtained for each TFS as well as for the “general team effectiveness” category. This is then
correlated with which method (6-Hats or MBTI) was used to form the team. The results can be
seen in Table 6. Note that some teams were originally formed using one method but
coincidentally met the criteria for both the 6-Hats AND the MBTI TFS. To review the specific
criteria for the 6-Hats and MBTI based TFS, see Figures 1 and 2. Also note that the meaning of
the numerical values in Table 6 follows from the instructions given in Appendix 2 where it is
stated that: +2=Very True; +1=Mostly True; 0=Neutral; -1=Mostly Un-True; -2=Very
Un-True.

A number of observations/conclusions can be made from the data in Table 6. First, it appears
that when the 6-Hats TFS criteria are met (compared to when they are not met), the teams rate
more highly on both the 6-Hats based questions (1.11 vs. 0.84) as well as the MBTI based
questions (0.90 vs. 0.62). For the teams which meet the MBTI TFS criteria (again compared to
those who do not met the criteria), the ratings for the MBTI based questions show a significant
difference (0.82 vs. 0.71) while the ratings for the 6-Hats based questions do not (1.01 vs. 0.98).
Possibly the most significant result (and in all honesty the least expected) appears when teams
which meet BOTH criteria are compared with those who met only one of the two criteria. In
every category (6-hats based questions, MBTI based questions, general questions and course
GPA) the teams which met BOTH sets of criteria rated higher.
V.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this current work an instrument which provides a new categorization for team interaction
styles/roles based on the 6-Hats system [DeBono 1985] was developed. The accuracy of this
instrument was measured and was found to be good. Next, the teams formed using the 6-Hats
based team formation strategy (TFS) were compared to those formed using a MBTI based TFS.
Results show that teams based on the 6-Hats TFS are more effective overall than those based on
the MBTI TFS. In addition, those teams which meet both the 6-Hats and the MBTI criteria for
team formation were significantly more effective than teams which met only the 6-Hats or the
MBTI based TFS criteria, but not both.
The study reported here represents data taken from 2 sections of approximately 25 students each.
There were 10 teams, each having 4 or 5 people. A continuation of this work is in progress
which will involve about 225 additional students comprising approximately 55 teams. This data
will be available for analysis at the end of 1999. It is anticipated that this data will provide
statistically significant conclusions where the present data shows only presumably significant
(although consistent and predictable) trends.
