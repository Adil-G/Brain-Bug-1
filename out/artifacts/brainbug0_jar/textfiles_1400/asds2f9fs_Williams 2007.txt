BUILDING GENUINE TRUST THROUGH
INTERPERSONAL EMOTION MANAGEMENT: A
THREAT REGULATION MODEL OF TRUST AND
COLLABORATION ACROSS BOUNDARIES
MICHELE WILLIAMS
Cornell University
I introduce the construct of threat regulation as an agentic interpersonal process for
building and maintaining trust. I examine threat regulation as a specific dimension of
interpersonal emotion management that fosters trust and effective cooperation by
allowing individuals to understand and mitigate the harm that their counterparts
associate with cooperating—in particular, harm from opportunism, identity damage,
and neglect of their interests. To explicate the microprocesses of threat regulation, I
draw on social cognitive theory, symbolic interactionism, and the psychology of
emotion regulation.

Knowledge workers on collaborative interorganizational projects must gain the cooperation
of counterparts over whom they have no hierarchical control. As interorganizational collaboration has grown within and between industries
(Gomes-Casseres, 1996; Powell, 1990), the ability
of knowledge workers to develop interpersonal
trust across organizational boundaries has become increasingly critical. Trust not only enables
cooperation when authority relationships are absent (Bradach & Eccles, 1989) but also increases
risk sharing, reduces the need to monitor others’
behavior, and facilitates access to “richer-freer”
information (Currall & Judge, 1995; Powell &
Smith-Doerr, 1994; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Uzzi,
1997). Unfortunately, developing trust across organizational boundaries can be difficult, because
people frequently perceive individuals from other
groups as less trustworthy than members of their
own group—that is, they often perceive members
of other groups as individuals with aspirations,
beliefs, or styles of interacting that threaten their
own group’s goals (Fiske & Ruscher, 1993; Kramer,

1991, 1994; Kramer & Messick, 1998; Sitkin & Roth,
1993; Williams, 2001).
Strategic interpersonal actions that signal
trustworthiness may mitigate the potential negative effects of group boundaries on the development of trust between knowledge workers
who span these boundaries. For instance, steps
taken to avoid threatening the goals, aspirations, values, and identity concerns of others
may help boundary spanners signal goodwill,
cooperative intent, and trustworthiness, while
also avoiding the defensive, noncooperative responses frequently associated with feeling
threatened. However, with few exceptions
(Child & Möllering, 2003; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998), the scholarly research on
trust has not focused on the intentional interpersonal actions individuals can use to build trust.
Scholars have most often described trust development as a relatively passive process of gathering data about other people’s trustworthiness
by watching their behavior in various situations
over time (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Ring & Van de
Ven, 1994; Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992)
or by using information from proxy sources (e.g.,
Burt & Knez, 1996; Zucker, 1986). Scant attention
has been given to the fact that people are evaluating the trustworthiness of individuals, who
are often not passive but engaged in active attempts to influence the evaluation process. Consequently, we know little about the strategies
people use to intentionally build and maintain
trusting relationships.

I thank Lotte Bailyn, John Carroll, Arturs Kalnins, Nancy
Rothbard, Anand Swaminathan, and three anonymous AMR
reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this
paper. I also appreciate the feedback received from presentations at the 2005 annual meeting of the Academy of Management, the 2004 meetings of the American Sociological
Association, the 2004 MFCA Conference, the Wharton OB
Conference, and the OSG Seminar (Sloan School of Management, MIT).

Scholars have paid even less attention to how
and why these intentional attempts to build
trust might require emotion management. With
few exceptions, such as Rafaeli and Sutton’s
(1991) examination of the trust-related implications of the emotional contrast strategies of interrogators (i.e., the good-cop, bad-cop strategy),
authors of the literature on emotional management in organizations have not focused on trust.
Rather, they have focused on the regulation of
individuals’ own emotional expression in accordance with organizationally mandated “feeling
rules” or “display rules” (e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1979;
Martin, Knopoff, & Beckman, 1998; Morris & Feldman, 1998; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989, 1990; Sutton
1991).1 Similarly, work on emotional contagion
has not focused on trust development but,
rather, on the influence that one individual’s
emotional expression can have on the emotional
experience of others (e.g., Barsade, 2002; Bartel &
Saavedra, 2000; Tan, Foo, & Kwek, 2004). Consequently, we have much to learn about the implications that actively managing another person’s
emotions may have for the development and
maintenance of trust.
In this article I assert that the risks of opportunism (i.e., self-interested behavior by another
that conflicts with one’s own goals), neglect of
one’s interests, and identity damage pose significant obstacles to maintaining trust and cooperation because these risks can lead counterparts to anticipate harm, experience negative
emotion, and engage in defensive behavior. I
not only contend that the concept of threat is
central to the intentional actions of knowledge
workers who build and maintain trust across
organizational boundaries but also directly address the importance of the intentional interpersonal actions taken by these boundary spanners
to influence the threats that others experience.
My model introduces the construct of interpersonal threat regulation as a multistep process
for managing the harm that others associate
with cooperating. Whereas other works in the

1

I use the terms emotion regulation and emotion management interchangeably. These terms refer to the same phenomenon but have their roots in different disciplines. Emotion regulation is used primarily in the social psychology
literature (e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1998; Gross, 1998), whereas
emotion management is used more often in sociology and
organization theory (e.g., Hochschild, 1979).

April

organizational literature focus more heavily on
the action implications of individuals’ perceptions of risk or potential harm to themselves
(e.g., “issue” selling, by Ashford, Rothbard, Piderit, & Dutton, 1998; psychological safety, by
Edmondson, 1999; organizational silence, by
Morrison & Milliken, 2000), the interpersonal
threat regulation model presented here focuses
on the active, intersubjective processes of understanding and managing other people’s perceptions of threat and on the implications of
these intersubjective processes for trust and collaboration.2
I argue that threat regulation is a social cognitive process that influences (1) the level of
harm that others believe will affect their goals,
concerns, and well-being and (2) the manner in
which others experience and express emotions
related to this level of anticipated harm. Threat
regulation has an impact on others through
three processes: perspective taking, threatreducing behavior, and reflection.
Perspective taking—imagining others’ thoughts
or feelings from their point of view (Davis, 1996;
Mead, 1934)—is central to facilitating responsive
interpersonal interactions (Blumer, 1969; Mead,
1934). This process provides an interpersonal understanding of the risks to cooperation (i.e., risks
of opportunism, neglect, identity damage). It enables individuals to comprehend which of these
risks are being experienced by others as threats
and may, thus, inhibit trust and cooperation. The
next process, threat-reducing behavior, involves
boundary spanners’ intentional efforts to influence the emotional responses of others. I define
threat-reducing behavior as a set of intentional
interpersonal actions intended to minimize or
eliminate counterparts’ perceptions that one’s
actions are likely to have a negative impact on
their goals, concerns, or well-being. I contend
that threat-reducing behavior translates personal emotion regulation strategies (e.g., Gross,
1998; Hochschild, 1979; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984)
into an interpersonal context, which permits individuals to reduce the defensive and negative
emotional responses often received when others
feel threatened. The third process, reflection, allows individuals to assess and self-correct (Ban-

threat regulation interchangeably. I am always referring to
the interpersonal process.

dura, 1986, 2001) for insufficient, inaccurate, or
inappropriate threat reduction.
I argue that threat regulation by boundary
spanners influences their counterparts in several ways. It decreases the negative emotional
responses associated with the anticipation of
harm, it increases the positive emotional responses associated with being understood, it
signals benevolent, trustworthy intentions, and
it demonstrates social competencies required
for future trustworthy behavior.
Taken together, the threat regulation processes of perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior, and reflection represent a cognitive and
affective investment in signaling trustworthiness. This investment is difficult to fake for opportunistic individuals, because their true feelings may “leak” out through nonverbal behavior
(Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). Further, it may also
have the positive externality of requiring psychological processes that elicit genuine affective attachments, which can reinforce both trust
and cooperation.
I proceed as follows. First, I review the threats
that may prevent cooperation and forestall trust
development. Next, I describe the threat regulation framework introduced in this article and
detail the three active, social cognitive processes associated with threat regulation: perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior, and
reflection. I then develop hypotheses that explore how threat regulation elicits trust and cooperation from others. I conclude with a discussion and implications.
THREAT
Individuals in organizations may associate
threats with interdependent projects because
they often frame the issues in their environment
as threats or opportunities, depending on the
potential of each for personal loss and gain
(Jackson & Dutton, 1988). Although individuals
may anticipate successful, mutual cooperation
on interdependent knowledge creation projects,
interdependent projects frequently entail risks.
Those risks may include harm from opportunism
(e.g., Luo, 2001; Williamson, 1975), demeaning
interactions that damage the identities of
project members (e.g., Ashford et al., 1998; Edmondson, 1999; Jehn, 1997), and the unintended
neglect of individuals’ interests by other project
members (Sheppard & Sherman, 1998). When the

597

potential for harm and loss exists, counterparts
may cease to view a cooperative project as an
opportunity for joint gain and may come to view
it as a threat to their goals, concerns, and wellbeing.
Lazarus and Folkman formally define threats
as “harms or losses that have not yet taken
place but are anticipated” (1984: 32). Harms include both material losses and subjective damage to one’s identity, status, perceived power,
and so forth. Threats to cooperation are associated with negative emotional responses, such
as stress and anxiety (Lazarus, 1991; Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984) that can inhibit trust development. They evoke these emotions because they
have the potential to interrupt goal attainment,
and goal interruption evokes emotional responses (e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1998; Lazarus,
1991; Mandler, 1975). In addition, because trustworthy individuals are expected to act in ways
that are “not harmful” (Gambetta, 1988), threats
to cooperation are also likely to translate into
negative beliefs about others’ trustworthiness.
Although the focus of this article is on threat
regulation and intentional behavior that influences others’ perceptions of threat, I first review
three major sources of risk and harm that others
may perceive while working on interdependent
projects: opportunism (i.e., another acting based
on opposing self-interests), neglect of one’s interests, and identity damage during interactions. Whereas opportunism and neglect have
both received attention in the trust literature
(e.g., Granovetter, 1985; Luo, 2001; Sheppard &
Sherman, 1998; Whitener et al., 1998; Williamson, 1993), the fear of identity damage during
interactions has been addressed less often as
an obstacle to trust development. The anticipation of identity damage during interactions,
however, can lead to negative emotions that
forestall cooperation and undermine trust in the
same manner that the anticipation of opportunism and neglect does. Moreover, identity damage during interactions is the only one of these
three threats not mitigated through contracts.
Opportunism As a Threat
Opportunism refers to self-interested behavior that often occurs with guile (Williamson,
1975). Opportunism is typically perceived when
one “takes advantage” of others or uses others’
weaknesses for one’s own benefit. Opportunism

<-----Page 3----->598

Academy of Management Review

represents a greater source of potential harm
when individuals’ instrumental goals are misaligned or in direct conflict. It undermines perceptions of trustworthiness because it is detrimental to individuals’ instrumental interests.
On knowledge work projects—projects that involve problem solving and the use and transfer
of information (Garicano, 2000)— opportunism is
a significant risk. It is often difficult to detect
opportunistic behavior and malfeasance on
knowledge work projects because tasks are frequently nonroutine, ambiguous, and difficult to
evaluate by nonexperts. Examples of nonroutine
knowledge work include such activities as
bringing new ideas together in written form
(e.g., a report), transferring tacit “know-how”
(e.g., experiential knowledge about how to
launch a new product or manage a postmerger
integration project), or incorporating knowledge
into a new technology (e.g., a software program
or medical imaging device).
Although contracts, monitoring, and other
safeguards such as credible commitments can
reduce goal misalignment on knowledge work
projects, a large number of contingencies and
noncontractible issues are part of most interfirm
relationships and projects (Perrone, Zaheer, &
McEvily, 2003; Spier, 1992). For example, boundary spanners are typically “faced with an eventuality that does not alter the letter of the agreement, but requires modification of how the terms
of the contract are fulfilled” (Perrone et al., 2003:
426). Opportunism and guile in dealing with
these modifications can prevent parties from arriving at a jointly optimal solution and increase
the time and cost of arriving at any solution.
In addition, whenever tasks are nonroutine,
ambiguous, or uncertain, as they often are in
knowledge-intense contexts, it is often too costly
or technically impossible to write a completely
specified contract that fully eliminates conflicting goals, accurately predicts future contingencies, and produces outcomes that can be verified
by a third party (Baker, Gibbons, & Murphy, 2002;
Macneil, 1974; McEvily, Zaheer, & Perrone, 2004).
Because contractual mechanisms often do not
fully eliminate the risk of opportunism, the
threat or anticipation of opportunism can generate both negative emotions (e.g., stress, fear,
anxiety) and the defensive, noncooperative, and
avoidant actions that often accompany these
emotional responses.

Neglect of One’s Interests As a Threat
Neglecting the interests of others when making decisions on an interdependent project can
result in unanticipated harm to counterparts.
For example, when a vice president independently approves new software to reduce costs
for his or her division, it may complicate a systems integration project spearheaded by another division. Sheppard and Sherman (1998)
note that both the neglect of counterparts’ instrumental interests and the neglect of their
identity-related concerns and values can undermine trust. Neglect that causes harm decreases
perceived benevolence, a cognitive predictor of
trust (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), and
generates negative emotions, which have an affective influence on trust (Dunn & Schweitzer,
2005).
Neglect can also negatively influence perceptions of social competence. When social cues
are misread (e.g., boundary spanners fail to accurately decode, uncover, anticipate, or understand their counterparts’ views on the harmful
impact of specific decisions), even benevolent
individuals may unintentionally make decisions that have detrimental effects on their
counterparts. Thus, neglect of others’ interests
may undermine multiple bases of trustworthiness.

Identity Damage As a Threat
Identity damage refers to the experience of
having a valued self-image denied or having
one’s self-esteem undermined. Self-esteem
threat involves situations in which “favorable
views about oneself are questioned, contradicted, impugned, mocked, challenged, or otherwise put in jeopardy” (Baumeister, Smart, &
Boden, 1996: 8). Self-image threat is similar but
involves being denied the image, identity, or
“face” that one overtly claims during an interaction (Goffman, 1967). In this article I include
within the scope of the argument identity damage that occurs during both synchronous interactions (e.g., face-to-face or telephone communication) and asynchronous interactions (e.g.,
hand-delivered correspondence, email, or fax).
Although all interactions afford people the opportunity to accept or reject the self-image that
their counterparts put forth (Goffman, 1967;
Mead, 1934), the context of knowledge work

<-----Page 4----->2007

Williams

makes people’s image and identity as an expert
more salient. Knowledge work demands problem solving and an exchange of information and
ideas that can expose individual weaknesses,
such as doubts, gaps in knowledge, and the
need for help. Individuals may anticipate harm
when they become proponents for issues that
are relevant to an identity group they belong to
(Ashford et al., 1998); when they reveal problems,
issues, or errors within their organization (Edmondson, Bohmer, & Pisano, 2001; Morrison &
Milliken, 2000); or when they take an interpersonal risk, such as expressing new ideas (Edmondson, 1999). Although the threat of identity
damage is proposed to influence relevant organizational phenomena, such as organizational
silence (Morrison & Milliken, 2000), the ways in
which the threat of identity damage influences
trust development and trust maintenance have
received little attention.
The threat of identity damage is relevant in a
knowledge-intense context because accusations, disrespect, or even thoughtless actions
can harm a counterpart’s self-image or selfesteem at any point during a collaborative
project. In fact, as unanticipated errors and unpredictable problems arise at various points
during a project, the potential for identity damage may temporarily increase, because these
situations require negotiated solutions, and
“many common negotiation tactics— disputing
the value of an item, providing alternative anchors and frames, questioning interests and motives, criticizing arguments, and disregarding
appeals—fall into the category of intrinsic
threats to face [i.e., self-image]” (White, Tynan,
Galinsky, & Thompson, 2004: 103). Even wellintentioned offers of help can wound a counterpart’s self-image or self-esteem by implying that
the recipient is inferior or inadequate (Fisher,
Nadler, & Whitcher-Alagna, 1982; Lee, 1997).
Identity damage can result from intentional
social undermining, from the neglect of another’s identity concerns, or from a lack of understanding of those concerns. Thus, when individuals anticipate that others will damage their
identity during an interaction, they may attribute the damage to several factors that would
make a counterpart less trustworthy: intentional
malevolence, social ineptitude, or careless neglect. Gil, a management consultant I interviewed about critical incidents in relationship
building, noted an occasion when he inadver-

599

tently threatened a client’s self-image as an expert in simulation technology:
The client thought he knew a lot about simulation
technology, but what he wanted was somewhat
amateurish and . . . I knew that the company’s
CEO had seen the best of what was out there in
modeling and simulation so what the client
wanted to show him would be one big yawn.
My concern was that the client would not only
fail to secure additional funding (for the project),
but also lose some of his current funding. So, I
sent him an email expressing my views on what
we were about to do.
He took a personal affront to that email. He
thought it was an arrogant statement—that I
thought I knew what was in the best interest of
his division. He sent me back a zinger [of an
email] about the unmitigated gall . . . [of my original message].
I’m not bothered by it, but it certainly was not
the way to do things. In retrospect, I would not
have sent that email because it kind of slammed
the door on us doing a whole lot of business for
them in that particular arena. I clearly took the
wrong path to reach that client. My intent was
honorable. I wasn’t trying to tick him off. But, he
took it as a personal affront. I needed to figure out
a [better] way to help.

As Gil’s experience suggests, identity threats
can cause people to avoid admitting that they
need help. Even when help is readily available,
the threat of self-esteem damage often prevents
individuals from seeking it. Lee (1997: 345, Study
One), for instance, found that only one-third of
the subjects who were given a task that was
“extremely difficult and time consuming” were
willing to ask for help, although help was
readily available. Identity threats can also lead
to reduced cooperation, and this reduction may
occur even when cooperation is in an individual’s material self-interest. White et al. (2004)
found that a high sensitivity to self-image threat
was related to a decreased chance of creating
value that would have benefited both parties in
a negotiation situation.
Identity damage during interaction evokes
negative views of others’ trustworthiness (e.g.,
negative perceptions of their benevolence) and
negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, and
fear. Although reactions to identity damage are
similar to those associated with opportunism
and neglect of one’s interests, I contend that
identity damage during interactions cannot be
eliminated by contractual safeguards or other

common substitutes for trust that align goals.
For instance, Jehn (1997) argues that goal alignment cannot eliminate relational/emotional conflict, which is based on personality conflicts and
identity damage. She states that “even when
group members work on the same project, have
mutual interest in completing it, and similar
ideas of how to complete the project, they still
may experience (relational/emotional) conflict”
(Jehn, 1997: 530).3 The potential for identity damage during interactions is an ongoing emotional
hazard on collaborative projects, even when
goals are aligned.
THREAT REGULATION: AN INTRODUCTION
The threat regulation model developed in this
section focuses on the intersubjective processes
involved with understanding and managing
other people’s experience of threat, rather than
the self-regulation of personally perceived
threats (see Figure 1). For clarity, I specify the
model in terms of the actions and intersubjective experiences of one individual in a dyad;
however, both individuals in a relationship may
engage in threat regulation simultaneously.
The threat or harm that others anticipate during cooperation (e.g., identity damage via denigration, opportunism via shirking or deception)
can lead to negative emotion, defensiveness,
and avoidance, which make securing their trust

3
Jehn (1995, 1997) found that emotional conflict was negatively related to performance and suggested that the negative emotion associated with emotional conflict interfered
with cooperation.

and cooperation more difficult. When faced with
counterparts who anticipate harm or offer less
cooperation than is necessary to reach interdependent goals, boundary spanners may actively
seek to gain the trust of their counterparts,
rather than simply waiting for their counterparts
to observe their personal trustworthiness over
time. Thus, in contrast to current models of trust,
which most often portray trust targets (i.e., people to be trusted) as passive individuals whose
trustworthiness must be observed through repeated interactions (e.g., Lewicki & Bunker, 1996;
Mayer et al., 1995; Sheppard & Sherman, 1998), I
take an agentic perspective (Bandura, 1986, 2001;
Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1934).
I introduce the construct of interpersonal
threat regulation as a process through which
individuals attempt to understand and influence the thoughts and emotions that others have
with respect to anticipated harm. I assert that
boundary spanners actively and intentionally
engage in interpersonal threat regulation strategies for securing and maintaining trust and
cooperation. Using a social cognitive lens (Bandura, 1986, 2001), I propose that interpersonal
threat regulation is a three-step approach to
gaining interpersonal cooperation that involves
perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior,
and reflection. I examine threat regulation both
as a process of interpersonal emotion management and as a process of symbolic interactions.
To illustrate the three steps in the threat regulation process, I begin with an example from
an interview with Ted, a boundary-spanning
management consultant:

<-----Page 6----->2007

Williams

I realized that my client, Pat, was losing money,
and that it didn’t make sense to keep the new
division she’d created . . . [but] I couldn’t say,
“Look you have to kill your baby!” I never went to
Pat with a report that was fully produced and
never tried to do a group presentation in front of
other senior managers. . . . [If I’d done that] Pat
probably would have felt, “Well, this is what they
think!” and would have ignored our work.
One thing I did was to go to Pat informally.
“Look,” I said, “this is how we’re coming to understand the numbers.”
Even with our strategy of informal meetings,
Pat didn’t believe us at first. But over time, we
were able to explain why we were saying what
we were saying. We’d share key information and
analyses, listen, and plan whatever additional
analyses were necessary. After four weekly meetings with updated analyses, Pat changed her
point of view.
By the end of the 12 weeks, she had changed so
radically that when we gave her pointers on how
to improve the situation without eliminating the
initiative [she had created], she wasn’t willing to
make the sacrifices it would take to save it. She
decided to end it. Six months later the division
that she created had disappeared. A year after
the engagement, Pat was in-line to head one of
the company’s largest divisions.
I think that we succeeded here because we
earned Pat’s respect and trust, not necessarily
her full trust, but enough trust so that she was
willing to keep the lines of communication open.
When I started a second project with her more
than two years later, I knew that she would listen
from the start.

THREAT REGULATION PROCESSES:
PERSPECTIVE TAKING, THREAT-REDUCING
BEHAVIOR, REFLECTION
The first step in threat regulation involves
identifying the threats to collaboration that
one’s counterpart may be experiencing. In the
example the boundary-spanning consultant’s
conclusion that his counterpart’s initiative was
losing money had negative implications for the
counterpart’s self-esteem and image as the successful founder of a new division and for the
counterpart’s career success (especially if the
problem had been presented to her superiors
before she had identified and corrected it). The
boundary-spanning consultant first anticipated
what the counterpart’s reaction would be to various interpersonal actions for delivering the information (e.g., providing a report, giving a presentation in front of her superiors, talking

601

informally) and then selected a behavior that
would reduce the threat the client would experience (i.e., talking informally). At several points,
Ted, the boundary-spanning consultant, reflected on his trust building. He noted both that
“Pat didn’t believe us at first” and that, by the
end of the engagement, “we earned Pat’s respect
and trust.”
In the following sections I discuss each step of
the threat regulation process. These steps are
summarized with examples in Table 1, and the
theoretical underpinnings of each step of the
threat regulation process are summarized in Table 2.
Perspective Taking
Perspective taking, the intrapsychic process of
imagining another’s thoughts, motives, or feelings from that person’s point of view (Davis,
1996; Mead, 1934), is the first step in threat regulation. As a process for gaining interpersonal
understanding, perspective taking is an intentional mechanism for engaging in the social
cognitive process of forethought (i.e., anticipating possible outcomes; Bandura, 1986, 2001). It is
also a mechanism for the symbolic interactions
required both to understand the meaning that a
situation holds for another and to adjust to the
needs of an interaction counterpart (Blumer,
1969; Goffman, 1967; Mead, 1934). To avoid
threatening a counterpart’s self-image or “face,”
for instance, boundary spanners need to interpret the meaning of their counterparts’ actions
such that they understand the values that counterparts place on various goals, possessions,
achievements, and identities (Brown & Levinson, 1987). Perspective taking allows people to
better understand what others find threatening
to their valued identities and to their material
well-being. It also provides the information necessary to mitigate the threat others perceive
during collaborative interactions.
Understanding the reasons for another person’s feelings requires understanding how that
person cognitively appraises a situation from
his or her point of view. Cognitive appraisals
are an integral component of people’s emotional
responses to events (e.g., Ellsworth & Scherer,
2003; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Cognitive appraisals occur when people evaluate an external event with respect to its significance for
them as individuals (Lazarus, 1991; Lazarus &

affect their goals, concerns, and well-being and (2) how others experience and express emotions related to this level of
anticipated harm.

Folkman, 1984). According to cognitive appraisal
theories of emotion (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003;
Smith & Ellsworth, 1985), individuals not only evaluate the implications of events for their own goals,
concerns, and well-being but also assess the human agency associated with these events—that
is, they determine who is responsible for their
positive or negative outcomes (Ellsworth, 1991;
Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985).
Understanding how someone is likely to cognitively appraise an event provides information
on that person’s probable emotional reaction,

because each emotion has an associated set of
appraisals (e.g., Ellsworth, 1991; Lerner & Keltner, 2000, 2001; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). For example, if a decision that thwarts employees’
goals is made by their supervisor, whom they
then hold responsible for the negative outcomes,
these employees are likely to feel anger toward
their supervisor (anger involves negative goal
conduciveness and attributions of responsibility
to another); however, if their goals are thwarted
by uncontrollable circumstances, they are likely
to feel sadness (which involves negative goal

conduciveness and attributions that no one is
responsible; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985).
I identify cognitive appraisal–related perspective taking as the process of imagining the
cognitive appraisals of one’s counterparts from
their point of view, and I propose that it is cognitive appraisal–related perspective taking that
facilitates the understanding of counterparts’
experiences of threat and their probable emotional responses to one’s actions. In the threatreducing example, Ted, the consultant, used
cognitive appraisal–related perspective taking
to surmise that the information he was going to
present to the client would be highly negative
for the client’s identity and career concerns (e.g.,
her goals for the new initiative, her chances for
career advancement, her self-image concerns in
front of the CEO, her self-esteem, and her subjective well-being). If Ted had not used cognitive
appraisal–related perspective taking, he might
have imagined the client would be unhappy
with the bad news about the initiative, but he
may have stopped short of understanding (1) the
multiple sources of negative emotions that the
client might experience, such as the threats of

identity and career damage; (2) the client’s perceptions of the consultant as an agent of potential harm to the client; and (3) the range of possible negative thoughts and emotions the client
might experience as a result of the news (e.g.,
wounded pride, shame, guilt, feelings of inadequacy, anger, indignation). This additional level
of understanding may be highly relevant for selecting a course of action. For instance, if the
client in our example had not been involved in
founding the failing initiative and therefore did
not feel that her self-image and promotion potential were at stake, sending a simple report
describing the problem might have been perfectly appropriate.
I propose that cognitive appraisal–related
perspective taking is an essential part of interpersonal threat regulation not only because it
facilitates the understanding necessary for responsive action but because it evokes more empathetic and responsive action tendencies as
well. Batson, Turk, Shaw, and Klein (1995), for
example, found that individuals who engaged
in perspective taking felt more empathy for the
target and increased the value they placed on

<-----Page 9----->604

Academy of Management Review

that individual’s welfare. Krauss and Fussell
(1990, 1991) showed that perspective taking increased the degree to which individuals adjusted their message to a listener’s knowledge
base. Parker and Axtell’s (2001) findings suggest
that taking the perspective of one’s suppliers is
positively related to helpfulness and cooperative behavior toward those suppliers.
Although cognitive appraisal–related perspective taking is a dimension of perspective
taking that has not previously been investigated
independently from other types of perspective
taking (e.g., cognitive, affective),4 I propose that
it is unique both because it provides the motivation to adjust one’s actions to the needs of
others and because it has the potential to provide information (such as the likely positive or
negative impact of different courses of action)
that can improve the effectiveness of one’s adjustments and responsiveness.
Threat-Reducing Behavior
The next step in threat regulation involves
planning to reduce the fear or anticipated harm
that one’s counterparts associate with cooperation and then engaging in the behaviors that
one has planned. Threat-reducing behavior refers to a set of intentional interpersonal actions
intended to minimize or eliminate counterparts’
perceptions that one’s actions are likely to have
a negative impact on their goals, concerns, or
well-being. It involves the social cognitive processes of purposeful planning and formulating
clear behavioral intentions (Bandura, 1986), and
it employs these processes to achieve interpersonal responsiveness—a central aspect of symbolic interactionism. For example, boundary
spanners who engage in threat-reducing behavior “plan and organize [their] actions with regard to what [they have] designated and evaluated” about their own goals, the expected action
of others, and so forth (Blumer, 1969: 62).
Additionally, threat-reducing behavior requires that boundary spanners interpret the
meaning of their counterparts’ actions and make

April

indications about how their counterparts should
act in order to generate new behavior, new perceptions, and new feelings in their counterparts
(Blumer, 1969). In terms of threat reduction, the
indications made by boundary spanners would
be designed to generate new, more cooperative
behavior, new perceptions of increased trustworthiness, and new feelings of ease and reduced anxiety.
Threat-reducing behavior involves strategies
from emotion regulation. Influencing the feelings of threat that others experience not only
requires both social cognitive planning and an
understanding of the symbolic meaning that interactions hold for one’s counterpart but also
managing the emotions of one’s counterpart.
When individuals manage or regulate their own
emotions, their emotion management strategies
fall into several categories: (1) they attempt to
alter or remove the emotion-provoking elements
of the situation; (2) they alter their attention—for
example, distract themselves from the emotionprovoking situation; (3) they alter the way they
think about the situation—that is, cognitive reframing; or (4) they modulate their emotional
response—for example, biofeedback, suppression, self-medication (for a review of these four
categories of emotion regulation, see Gross,
1998).5 Although few studies exist on interpersonal emotion management, those that do suggest that when individuals manage the emotions of others, they use the same emotion
management strategies that they use intrapersonally (Francis, 1997; Lively, 2000; Thoits, 2004).
We propose that individuals using threatreducing behaviors employ the four categories
of emotion management strategies distilled by
Gross (1998) to reduce a counterpart’s anticipated harm (i.e., his or her experience of feeling
threatened).6 Table 3 summarizes the interpersonal application of each emotion management
strategy to threat regulation.

However, items reflecting cognitive appraisals (e.g., “Try
to imagine how [this situation] has affected [this person’s]
life”) can be found along with more affective items (e.g., “Try
to imagine how this [person] feels”) as part of manipulations
aimed at inducing perspective taking about others’ feelings
(Batson et al., 1995: 306, Studies 3 and 4).

Also see work on emotion regulation by Hochschild
(1979), Lazarus and Folkman (1984), Carver and Scheier
(1998), and Folkman and Moskowitz (2004).

Although we propose that the categories are the same
for personal and interpersonal emotion management, the
dominant tactics within each category may differ when
managing another person’s emotions versus when managing one’s own emotions.

Application

1. Altering the situation

Includes modifying or
changing the situation by
removing some or all of
the emotion-provoking
elements (Gross, 1998)

Threat-reducing behaviors
employing this strategy
remove or modify the
elements of a situation
that would have a
negative impact on
others’ goals, concerns,
or well-being

Involves cognitive reframing
or reappraisal—taking the
facts and critical elements
of the situation and
formulating a plausible
narrative that will have a
different emotional impact
(Folkman & Moskowitz,

4. Modulating
emotional response

Involves actions that
interrupt a current
experience of emotion;
refers to actions such as
deep breathing and
biofeedback that “[directly
influence] physiological,
experiential, or behavioral
responding” (Gross, 1998:
285), as well as intentional
emotional expression

Threat-reducing behaviors

from the elements of a
situation that are
harmful to individuals’
goals, concerns, or wellbeing
Threat-reducing behaviors

reframe events in a
manner that causes
other individuals to

experiential (emotional),
or behavioral responses
that others are having
in response to
anticipated harm
(anxiety, fear, etc.)

Threat-Reducing Example
• A manager might modify a threatinducing situation by holding a
meeting at a restaurant instead of
in the boardroom
• A firm’s VP of finance might put
her team at ease by pushing back
a meeting with the CEO and
giving the team an extra day to
“work the kinks out” of its
presentation
A consultant might redirect attention
to a hated rival firm whenever
clients become upset about the
jobs that will be lost in their
organization when they move the
firm’s payroll function to a
location “offshore” (i.e., in another
country)
A manager might cognitively
reframe a pay cut as a way to
save everyone’s job and the
company from bankruptcy or
liquidation; reframing the
situation in contrast to a more
negative event (i.e., job loss) can
reduce individuals’ perceptions of
that event’s negative impact on
their goals and well-being
A supervisor might manage the
reaction of an employee by
discussing a pay raise request
that is going to be rejected during
a walk to a restaurant a few
blocks away instead of a
restaurant in the same office
building—thus using exercise,
which causes deep breathing, to
modulate the employee’s
emotional response

a
This is an adaptation of relevant aspects of the four broad categories of self-emotion management (distilled by Gross,
1998) to the interpersonal emotion management context. Self-emotion management or emotion regulation refers to “the
process by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and
express these emotions” (Gross, 1998: 275).
b
When others comprehend and accept the new narrative explanation of the situation, their emotions change because they
have a different understanding of the implications of the event or situation for their goals, concerns, and well-being. Narrative
reappraisals may, for example, redefine who the relevant group is for social comparison, suggest the monetary amount
individuals should use as an cognitive anchor in negotiations, highlight aspects of a story that had been underplayed
previously, or make logical connects between elements of the narrative that were previously left unconnected.

the altering the situation strategy involve removing or modifing the elements of a situation
that may have a negative impact on others’
goals, concerns, or well-being. One senior consultant I interviewed mentioned allaying a cli-

ent’s concerns by replacing a team leader on the
consultants’ side, who had allowed his team to
miss a major project deadline, with another,
more assertive individual. In contrast, another
senior consultant mentioned a case in which

<-----Page 11----->606

Academy of Management Review

she dealt with a client’s performance concerns
by setting up weekly meetings between the client and the team member in question so that the
client could learn more about the value the
member was adding to the project. The senior
consultant recognized that the client’s concerns
were tied to the structure of the project, which
made this team member’s contributions unclear.
She modified the situation into one in which
each team member’s contributions to the project
were transparent to the client.
The second emotion management strategy, altering attention, does not change the threatening elements of a situation but, instead, involves
distracting attention away from those emotionprovoking elements. For example, in an interview about client relationships, a management
consultant mentioned focusing his clients’ attention on the client organization’s long-term
goals each time the clients became overwhelmed with the stress of their restructuring
effort.
The third strategy, altering the cognitive
meaning of the situation, refers to reframing the
situation in an attempt to influence the other
person’s cognitive appraisal of the situation. In
the case of threat-reducing behavior, reframing
will cause the other person to cognitively reappraise the situation as less potentially harmful.
Cognitive reframing or reappraisal involves
taking the facts and critical elements of the situation and formulating a plausible narrative
that will have a different emotional impact—in
our case, less harmful and threatening (Folkman
& Moskowitz, 2000). When others comprehend
and accept the new narrative reappraisal of the
situation, their emotions change because they
have a different understanding of the implications of the situation for their goals, concerns,
and well-being.
For instance, a manager might cognitively reframe a temporary pay cut as a loan/gift to help
“family” through tough times or as a way to save
everyone’s job and prevent layoffs. Reframing
the situation to encompass shared organizational goals and standards of fairness, instead of
leaving a framing in place that only includes
negative individual outcomes, can change people’s appraisal of the impact of a situation on
their overall well-being. In another example,
Huy (2002) found that managers who reframed
layoffs realistically as the only way to save the
most prized jobs and to help their organization

April

remain competitive fostered cooperation from
union leaders and employees for these organizational changes. Reframing organizational
downsizing as the only way to save a failing
company protected both union leaders’ instrumental interests of preserving as many jobs as
possible and their image as strong advocates
for their constituency. Edmondson et al. (2001)
found that surgeons who reframed the hierarchical operating room environment as a collaborative team environment in which all individuals
were expected to speak up about potential difficulties gained greater information sharing
about potential problems. In this study, the researchers found that reframing the operating
team environment reduced the apprehension
about denigration (i.e., identity damage) that
members of other more traditional teams associated with speaking up.
Individuals may also use a combination of
interpersonal emotion management strategies
when generating specific threat-reducing behaviors. For instance, Ted, the consultant in the
threat-reducing example, employed interpersonal emotion management strategies that involved altering the situation and altering the
cognitive meaning of the situation. His threatreducing behaviors included moving the interaction from a formal situation, such as a presentation, to an informal conversation, in which he
told the client, “This is how we’re coming to
understand the numbers.” He also cognitively
reframed the situation from one in which an
expert defined the problem and solution for a
client to one that reflected a collaborative problem-solving effort. He continued this problemsolving reframing through several meetings, until he developed more trust with the client, who
“did not believe [him] at first.”
The fourth and final emotion management
strategy, modulating emotional response, “refers to directly influencing physiological, experiential, or behavioral responding” (Gross, 1998:
285). Exercise, progressive relaxation, and drugs
(including alcohol) are tactics used both intraand interpersonally. For example, team building and executive retreats often include emotion-modulating activities such as exercise (e.g.,
rope climbing, skiing, golf, yoga, hiking), alcohol use (e.g., trips to a local winery), and/or relaxing activities (e.g., sailing, drumming, meditation).

<-----Page 12----->2007

Williams

The self-regulation or strategic use of emotional
expression can also modulate the emotions of others. When the regulation of emotional expression
is brought into an interpersonal context, it includes behaviors examined in research on emotion management, emotional contagion, and emotional labor (e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993;
Barsade, 2002; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1979,
1983; Martin et al., 1998; Morris & Feldman, 1996;
Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989, 1990, 1991; Sutton 1991;
Thoits, 2004; Van Mannen & Kunda, 1989). The
literature on emotional labor and the literature
on emotional contagion, for instance, suggest
that expressing positive moods and positive
emotions such as joy, enthusiasm, pleasantness,
and calm can influence the degree to which
other individuals feel those same emotions (e.g.,
Barsade, 2002; Bartel & Saavedra, 2002; Hochschild, 1979; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990; Tan et al.,
2004). Strategic emotional expression can also
be used to elicit emotions distinct from the emotions expressed. For example, anger can be
used to evoke fear, whereas sympathy can be
used to elicit calm (Sutton, 1991). Moreover, two
individuals working in concert but expressing
contrasting positive and negative emotions (i.e.,
good-cop, bad-cop) can intensify the positive
emotional response that others have to the individual who is strategically expressing the positive emotion (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1991).
Consistent with traditional research on emotional labor, which has tended to focus more on
individuals’ management of their own emotional expression in accordance with social
norms or “feeling rules” than on interpersonal
outcomes (e.g., Hochschild, 1983), the strategic
expression of emotion is the one technique of
interpersonal emotion management that is
mostly likely to require the self-management of
emotions to produce the specific emotion that a
boundary spanner wants to express to influence
others. Huy (2002), for instance, found that during
a radical organizational change process, middle
managers would report “psyching” themselves
up or “blanking out” negative thoughts before
interacting with their subordinates because
they did not want to exacerbate their subordinates’ fears about the change.
In sum, threat-reducing behavior is a broad
category within the interpersonal management
of emotion that may be used in a variety of
contexts for actively dealing with others’ experience of threat—identity threats (e.g., rejection

607

or denigration of the positive attributes that one
is claiming for oneself), instrumental threats
(e.g., job loss, reduced span of control, being
passed over for promotion), and combined
threats with implications for both identity and
instrumental concerns.7
Reflection
Step three in the threat regulation process is
reflection. By reflection, I mean assessing the
impact of one’s attempts to regulate others’ experiences of threat. Reflection includes the selfevaluative and self-corrective component of
agentic behavior or human agency (Bandura,
1986, 2001). On cooperative projects, individuals
who are engaged in threat regulation and active
trust building observe the emotional responses
and actions of others in order to assess the
amount of trust, cooperation, and defensiveness
they receive after each act of threat-reducing
behavior. Consistent with other self-regulation
processes that require information from others
(e.g., Ashford & Tsui, 1991), individuals engaged
in threat regulation must also attend to explicit
and implicit cues from others and engage in a
process to understand, interpret, and incorporate the responses of others into their future
behavior. Boundary spanners may use direct inquiry to assess the impact of their threatreducing behaviors; however, because of the
subtlety of emotion management processes,
they are less likely to rely on direct inquiry and
more likely to rely on behavioral cues— either
on direct and explicit cues from others, such as
overt acts of trusting behavior, or on less obvious cues, such as information gained through
what Ashford and Cummings (1983) refer to as
indirect observation/monitoring strategies.
Boundary spanners then interpret the meaning of these interpersonal behavioral cues using
sensemaking processes (Weick, 1995; Wrzesniewski, Dutton, & Debebe, 2003). After interpreting and analyzing others’ emotional and behavioral reactions for discrepancies between the
amount of trust and cooperation needed and the

7
Although threat-reducing behaviors may involve facesaving actions, such as ignoring a faux pax (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Goffman, 1967), they include a broader set of emotion regulation behaviors than encompassed by face saving
and are aimed at a wider category of interpersonal threats
(e.g., opportunism, neglect, and identity threats).

<-----Page 13----->608

Academy of Management Review

amount received, boundary spanners may take
self-corrective actions, such as increasing their
level of threat regulation to close gaps in trust.
For instance, in the threat regulation example,
Ted, the consultant, mentioned that he used a
series of joint problem-solving meetings with
his client after assessing that the client did not
believe him “at first.” His narrative indicated
that he continued to regulate the threat perceived by the client until this disbelief no longer
existed. In his final statement he also indicated
ongoing reflections about the level of trust he
had built, which he noted was “not necessarily
her full trust, but enough trust so that [the client]
was willing to keep the lines of communication
open.”
Reflection is the cornerstone of regulatory behavior because it enables individuals to take
corrective action. However, reflection can only
motivate corrective action if individuals hold
mental models that link their purposeful action
to the responses they receive from others. In
terms of threat regulation, boundary spanners
will only be motivated to continue engaging in
threat regulation to the degree they hold mental
models that link threat-regulating processes to
the experience of receiving trust and cooperation from their counterparts.
THREAT REGULATION AND TRUST
In the previous section I delineated the active
processes that constitute threat regulation. In
this section I examine the impact that threat
regulation has on a counterpart’s trust. I argue
that threat regulation processes not only influence the emotional responses of others but also
affect how interpersonal trust develops and is
maintained (Figure 2). I provide a brief background on trust before examining the processes
through which threat regulation influences it.
Background on Trust
Scholars have defined trust as one’s willingness to rely on another’s actions in a situation
involving the risk of opportunism (Mayer et al.,
1995; Williams, 2001; Zand, 1972). For example,
when boundary-spanning individuals are willing to reveal sensitive firm information to suppliers, they are willing to risk the harm that
would result if the information were shared with
their competitors. Trust is based on individuals’

April

expectations that others will behave in ways
that are helpful or at least not harmful (Gambetta, 1988). These expectations, in turn, are
based both on individuals’ perceptions of others’
trustworthiness— benevolence, integrity, and
ability (e.g., Butler, 1991; Gabarro, 1978; see
Mayer et al., 1995, for review)—and on their affective responses to others (e.g., Jones & George,
1998; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995).
Because trust reduces the need to monitor others’ behavior, formalize procedures, and create
completely specified contracts (Macauley, 1963;
Powell, 1990; Williamson, 1975), it is invaluable
to organizations that engage in collaborative
endeavors (Powell, 1990; Ring & Van de Ven,
1994; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998). Research
suggests that trust between boundary-spanning
individuals facilitates reliance on informal
agreements and informal cooperation, supplementing and improving the efficiency of formal
contracts (Currall & Judge, 1995; Dyer & Chu,
2003; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Saparito, Chen, &
Sapienza, 2004; Uzzi, 1997). Mutual trust also increases motivation to devote resources to joint
goals (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001). This type of allocation decision is particularly important for interorganizational projects because “boundary spanners [and their counterparts] are simultaneously
exposed to competing expectations from their
own and their partner organization” (Perrone et
al., 2003: 423).
Interpersonal trust also provides firms with
such benefits as more access to tacit knowledge,
increased risk sharing, and “richer-freer” information (Powell & Smith-Doerr, 1994). Further, it
decreases the likelihood that boundary spanners will plan to terminate an interorganizational relationship (Saparito et al., 2004) and allows
boundary-spanning individuals the freedom to
adjust to unanticipated contingencies in ways
that are jointly optimal, without the time and
effort that are associated with renegotiating a
contract with opportunistic partners (Lorenz,
1988; Uzzi, 1997).
Although trust facilitates cooperation on various types of nonhierarchical projects, active interpersonal strategies for building trust have
received little attention in the academic literature. Two exceptions are Child and Möllering’s
(2003) paper on active trust in the Chinese business environment and Whitener et al.’s (1998)
paper on managerial trust building. Child and
Möllering suggest that actively building per-

sonal rapport is positively related to trust. In
this article I expand the important concept of
active trust building beyond a general motivation to build personal relationships. I delineate specific psychological strategies and interpersonal emotion management tactics that
directly address potential risks and obstacles
to cooperation and trust in knowledge-based
contexts.
Whitener et al. (1998) discuss several ways to
initiate trust with employees. Whereas some of
their trust initiation strategies, such as behavioral consistency and behavioral integrity, require that counterparts observe a boundary
spanner’s behavior over time, other actions,
such as communicating accurately and thoroughly, demonstrating concern, and sharing
control, reflect a proactive stance toward initiating trust. I develop this proactive approach to-

ward trust building in two ways. First, I explore
both symbolic and social cognitive processes,
such as perspective taking, that enable proactive actions and responsive human agency in
trust building. Second, I not only examine the
feelings of threat, apprehension, anxiety, fear,
and so forth that counterparts may experience
when contemplating the risks involved with cooperation but also the role of interpersonal emotion management in strategically addressing
these threats. Investigating active processes
that attend to cognitive, affective, and symbolic
processes of active trust may be particularly
important for interorganizational relationships
if, as Malhotra and Murnighan argue, it is “more
difficult to transition non-embedded ties [those
that are based on formal structures such as
binding contracts] into embedded ties [those
that are based on trust and social relationships]

<-----Page 15----->610

Academy of Management Review

than to develop embedded ties from the start”
(2002: 554).
Threat Regulation and Trust
I propose that threat regulation actively fosters the development and maintenance of trust
and cooperation through several mechanisms.
Threat regulation influences individuals’ emotional responses to interactions and reveals social competencies that are important for future
trustworthy behavior. It signals trustworthiness
and involves an emotional investment that fosters trustworthy behavior.
Threat-reducing behavior, emotion, and trust.
Boundary spanners’ interpersonal threat-reducing behaviors influence the emotions of their
counterparts because these actions modify
counterparts’ perceptions (cognitive appraisals)
of whether the boundary spanners’ actions are
goal conducive. In general, behaviors that obstruct goals generate negative emotions,
whereas those that are goal conducive produce
positive emotions (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Mandler, 1975; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Threatreducing behaviors may avoid the negative
emotional responses people often have to instrumental conflicts, neglect of interests, and
identity damage. In addition, these behaviors
may generate the positive emotional responses
that people have when their goals and identity
(self-esteem and self-image) are supported or
enhanced (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Fisher et al.,
1982; House, 1981; Swann, 1987). Although mitigating negative emotion may prevent disruptive
behavior, it is the positive emotions associated
with threat regulation that may have a significant influence on facilitating trust and cooperation.
Threat-reducing behavior influences positive
emotions in two ways. First, because it demonstrates concern for the fears and threats counterparts may be experiencing, it can generate
the positive affect associated with receiving
emotional support and interpersonal understanding. For example, cognitive reframing of a
stressful or threatening situation for a counterpart can be a socially supportive action (House,
1981; Lively, 2004). Further, individuals may experience such emotional support and interpersonal understanding as the “emotional gifts” of
sympathy, care, or liking. Clark defines emotional gifts as “emotions that one social actor

April

expresses or displays (verbally or nonverbally)
to another that have value because they are
scarce—that is not given indiscriminately or
limitlessly—and because they create positive
emotions in others” (2004: 404).
Second, because threat-reducing behavior
communicates understanding of another’s fears
and concerns, it can be self-verifying and generate a positive emotional response. The process of having aspects of one’s self understood
can verify one’s identity, build relationships,
and generate positive affect. Moreover, selfverification can have these positive effects even
when the aspects of one’s self that are verified
are negative, such as one’s fears or weaknesses
(Swann, 1987). People with negative self-views,
for example, have been found to prefer a negative but accurate evaluator over a positive evaluator who is inaccurate and self-enhancing
(Swann, Stein-Seroussi, & Giesler, 1992). People,
in general, prefer evaluators and marital partners that verify aspects of their identity (i.e., see
them as they see themselves) because it makes
them feel that they know themselves (Swann,
1987; Swann et al., 1992). In small groups, selfverification has been associated directly with
increased feelings of attachment to group members (Swann, Milton, & Polzer, 2000).
Because positive feelings generated during
social exchange interactions influence affective
attachments and liking for the specific individuals involved in the exchange (Lawler, 2001), the
positive feelings stemming from self-verification and emotional support should not only influence a counterpart’s mood but also his or her
affective attachment to and liking for the boundary spanner. These positive emotions and affective attachments, in turn, can influence trust by
increasing the “feel” that another is trustworthy
(Jones & George, 1998) and by positively biasing
perceptions of trustworthiness, attributions, and
motivations that are relevant to trust maintenance (Williams, 2001).
Hypothesis 1: When an individual’s
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ affective attachment to
and positive affect for that individual
will also be greater.
Hypothesis 2: When counterparts’ affective attachment to and positive affect for an individual are greater, the
counterparts’ perceptions of that indi-

vidual’s trustworthiness will also be
greater.
The positive feelings associated with being
understood may not only influence trust but may
also directly influence cooperation by eliciting
helping behavior and other cooperative and
prosocial behaviors, such as information sharing (Williams, 2001). In organizational settings,
positive affect has been associated with helping
behavior, generosity, and cooperation (George,
1991; George & Brief, 1992; Isen & Baron, 1991).
Isen has noted that “a large body of research
indicates that positive affect can influence social behavior—in particular, sociability, cooperativeness in negotiation, and kindness” (1987:
206). The positive affect associated with feeling
understood may also influence affective attachments, which, in turn, may have an impact on
cooperation. Affective attachments (in the form
of relational cohesion) have been shown to influence individuals’ cooperative tendencies in
repeated exchange relationships, even in light
of attractive alternatives (Lawler & Yoon, 1996).
Hypothesis 3: When counterparts’ affective attachment to and positive affect for an individual are greater,
counterparts’ cooperative behavior toward that individual will also be
greater.
Threat-reducing behavior, social competence,
and trust. Threat-reducing behaviors reveal social competence because these actions demonstrate a boundary spanner’s interpersonal understanding of another’s fears, as well as the
social competencies required to gain this understanding. The social competencies associated
with threat regulation are typically observed
through a boundary spanner’s threat-reducing
behavior. Nonetheless, these competencies include cognitive appraisal–related perspective
taking and interpersonal emotion regulation
strategies, as well as such competencies as the
ability to perceive, understand, manage, and
use emotional information (abilities that constitute emotional intelligence; Mayer & Salovey,
1997; Salovey, Kokkonen, Lopes, & Mayer, 2004).
These social competencies reflect capabilities
that may be required for future trustworthy behavior on interdependent projects. For example,
cognitive and emotional understanding of others, often gained through perspective taking,

611

may be required to prevent inadvertent neglect
of others’ interests and to avoid statements and
actions that threaten the identities of important
project members. When a boundary spanner is
relied on to make decisions on behalf of others,
benevolent intentions may be insufficient if the
boundary spanner does not understand the
threats and benefits that others associate with
different options. Not only are abilities, including social abilities, a predictor of trust (Mayer et
al., 1995), but Sheppard and Sherman (1998) suggest that the social competency of emotional or
empathic understanding is an important component of trustworthiness when individuals are
highly interdependent.
Hypothesis 4a: When an individual’s
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ perceptions of that individual’s social competence (i.e., a social ability dimension of trustworthiness) will also be greater.
Threat-reducing behavior and signaling trustworthiness. Scholars agree that benevolence is
a core dimension of perceived trustworthiness
(e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). Threat-reducing behaviors signal benevolence—that is, concern for the
welfare of others— both because they decrease
the fears associated with the potential for opportunism, neglect, and identity damage and because these behaviors themselves may be perceived as benevolent, emotionally supportive
actions. In addition, by decreasing the potential
for harm to others, threat-reducing behaviors
may demonstrate or express concern—an expression proposed by Whitener et al. (1998) as a
way of initiating trust. Threat-reducing behaviors may also signal cooperative intent by acting as an “emotional gift” and generating perceptions that a boundary spanner’s objectives
are more goal conducive and less subject to
opportunism than their counterparts previously
thought.
Signaling benevolence may be particularly
important for building trust, because, once
formed, perceptions that a boundary spanner
will “protect one’s welfare” can reduce the extent to which counterparts will perceive that
threats to cooperation are likely to arise in the
future. Thus, reducing threats in one domain,
such as identity damage, can have positive
spillover effects in terms of increased perceptions of overall benevolence that may mitigate

<-----Page 17----->612

the perception of threats to cooperation in other
domains (e.g., opportunism and neglect).
Hypothesis 4b: When an individual’s
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ perceptions of that individual’s benevolence (a dimension of
trustworthiness) will also be greater.
Threat regulation, self-interest, and the credibility of signaling trustworthiness. Credible signals typically have a cost. Threat regulation processes are costly in terms of the interpersonal
effort and interpersonal emotion work involved.
Emotion work refers to the conscious effort to
alter feelings (Hochschild, 1979). Interpersonal
emotional work involves both cognitive and
emotional effort to alter the feelings of others.
On the cognitive side, it involves the effort associated with forethought and perspective taking, as well as planning and reflection. In terms
of emotional effort, it requires the abilities that
Mayer and Salovey (1997) associate with emotional intelligence: perceiving, understanding,
using, and managing emotions.
The time and interpersonal effort entailed in
boundary spanners’ investments in threat regulation may signal trustworthiness by leading
their counterparts to believe that trustworthy
behavior will be in the boundary spanners’
self-interest. In other words, counterparts may
believe that only trustworthy behavior by a
boundary spanner will produce a collaborative outcome of the quality necessary both to
warrant the boundary spanner’s initial investment of time, cognitive effort, and emotional
work and to generate a potential for future
collaboration that is worthy of the initial investment of effort. This emotionally costly signaling process operates in a manner similar to
processes noted by Klein and Leffler (1981), in
which a seller’s investments in expensive advertising can lead buyers to believe that producing and selling a high-quality product is
the only way for the seller to recoup advertising expenses.
Threat-reducing behavior, as the most easily
observed component of threat regulation, may
represent a credible signal not only because it
entails a costly emotional investment that
makes others feel understood and self-verified
but also because this investment is more costly
for individuals hiding opportunistic intentions.
Hiding one’s intentions during repeated interac-

April

tions on a collaborative project requires strict
monitoring of verbal and nonverbal actions that
might undermine one’s implicit assertion that
threat-reducing behavior is based on benevolent intentions. First, it requires effort to mask
opportunistic intentions. Second, opportunistic
individuals should find threat-reducing behaviors particularly difficult to fake for two reasons:
(1) the facial expressions for certain emotions,
such as concern, are more difficult to voluntarily
control than others, such as joy (Ekman, 1985;
Frank, 1988); (2) frequently, “our true feelings
‘leak’ out through the behavioral channels that
are less controllable” (Ambady & Rosenthal,
1992: 259). When opportunistic individuals fail to
monitor and control their nonverbal behavior,
counterparts may become suspicious, because,
“at some level, perceivers realize that people
can choose their words carefully, but they are
less adept at controlling their facial, vocal, and
bodily expressions” (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992:
259). Attempts to mask opportunistic motives for
threat regulation are likely to fail on long-term
collaborative projects that provide many opportunities for counterparts to observe inconsistencies between verbal and nonverbal behavior
and between benevolent and malevolent actions.
A final unique aspect of threat regulation as a
credible signal is that it is an emotional investment in understanding another person that is
tied to the potential positive externality of generating genuine concern for that individual’s
welfare (circumstances and emotions) from the
conscious decision to make an emotional investment. Batson et al. (1995) found that perspective
taking instructions could increase valuing of
and empathy for another. When a boundary
spanner intentionally engages in threat regulation, the resulting empathy can curb selfinterested behavior that might disadvantage
the target of his or her concern (Batson & Ahmad,
2001; Frank, 1988; Shott, 1979), thus making the
boundary spanner more trustworthy.
The potential for self-interested behavior to
result in genuinely benevolent actions is also
discussed and mathematically modeled by
Rotemberg, who argues that8

8

In this quote I have substituted “boundary spanner” and
“counterpart” for the original “leader” and “follower,” respectively.

<-----Page 18----->2007

Williams

altruism by a [boundary spanner] has a very particular rationale. Its benefit is that it leads the
[counterpart] to believe that the [boundary spanner] will not move the team in a direction that
benefits the [boundary spanner] at the expense of
the [counterpart]. The result is that the [counterpart] trusts the [boundary spanner]. This trust
then allows the [boundary spanner] to move the
team in directions that are beneficial to all members (1994: 709).

Consistent with his arguments about altruism,
Rotemberg (1994) does not argue that a boundary spanner’s threat regulation or benevolence
is a deception. Rather, he argues that after the
boundary spanner intentionally calculates the
benefits of threat regulation or benevolent actions, he or she then engages in considerate
behaviors that generate a genuine shift toward
benevolence. Thus, threat regulation may not
only represent an investment that can credibly
signal trustworthiness by aligning interests in
joint outcomes and future collaboration but also
may reflect an intentional decision capable of
generating behaviors that evoke genuine feelings that serve as relational sources of perceived trustworthiness.
Hypothesis 4c: When any one of the
three components of an individual’s
threat regulation is greater (i.e., perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior, or reflection), counterparts’
perceptions of that individual’s overall trustworthiness will also be
greater.
Effectiveness of threat-reducing behavior: A
moderating factor. For simplicity in the previous
section, I assumed that a boundary spanner’s
threat-reducing behaviors are effective at reducing counterparts’ concerns. However, because
threat regulation is an iterative process that involves reflecting on the effectiveness of one’s
threat-reducing behavior and self-correcting
discrepancies, any particular act of threatreducing behavior may be effective or ineffective at reducing a counterpart’s concerns. For
instance, threat-reducing behavior will be less
effective when boundary spanners misunderstand what is threatening to their counterparts
or when counterparts misinterpret attempts to
reduce their experience of threat. The less effective a specific threat-reducing behavior is at
alleviating a counterpart’s fear of harm, the less
likely it is that this particular act of threat-

613

reducing behavior will generate positive affect
and perceptions of trustworthiness (e.g., benevolence, social competence). At any point in time,
the relationship between the quantity of threatreducing behavior and the affect or trustworthiness generated will be moderated by the effectiveness of the threat-reducing behavior
selected. Over time, through the iterative process of reflection, perspective taking, and adjustments to their threat-reducing behaviors, individuals ideally will self-correct for ineffective
threat-reducing behavior.9
Hypothesis 5: The effectiveness of
threat-reducing behavior will moderate the relationship between the
quantity of threat-reducing behavior
and (a) affective attachment (H1), (b)
social competence (H4a), (c) benevolence (H4b), and (d) overall trustworthiness (H4c). The less effective threatreducing behavior is at addressing a
counterpart’s concerns, the less positive the relationship will be between
threat-reducing behavior and (a) affective attachment, (b) social competence, (c) benevolence, and (d) overall
trustworthiness.
THREAT REGULATION IN CONTEXT
Threat regulation takes place within a context
of specific organizations, particular tasks, and
specific interpersonal relationships. Such contexts generate instrumental and relational influences on threat regulation.
Organizational and Task Contexts
The organizational and task contexts of a
project generate instrumental influences on
9

Gender is an example of a factor that may influence the
effectiveness of threat-reducing behaviors. Because men are
stereotypically more agentic (Eagly, 1987; Rudman & Glick,
1999), for instance, they may be more effective at reducing
threat when they meet these stereotypic expectations by
selecting threat-reducing behaviors that are more action
oriented (e.g., actively altering a situation by removing
threatening elements). In contrast, because women are stereotypically considered more nurturing (Rudman & Glick,
1999), they may be more effective at reducing threat when
they select more supportive threat-reducing behaviors, such
as helping others think about a situation in a less threatening way.

<-----Page 19----->614

Academy of Management Review

threat regulation. These contexts increase the
power that each party has to interrupt the other’s goal attainment. For instance, the reward
systems that surround interdependent projects
influence the benefits that individuals will receive for successful collaboration, along with
the losses they will incur if some team members
thwart their ability to produce a successful
project. Similarly, reciprocal task interdependence, which involves mutual dependence on
the work and effort of others (Thompson, 1967),
not only provides boundary spanners with the
power to inadvertently interrupt counterparts’
goals but also provides their counterparts with
the ability to punish the boundary spanners for
any goal interruptions. Finally, positions of
power, such as team leader, also provide the
ability to disrupt goals, because individuals
with positional power may withhold needed resources or valued rewards. Increases in counterparts’ power to interrupt the goals of boundary
spanners will influence boundary spanners’ motivation to avoid interrupting counterparts, and
thereby avoid eliciting the negative emotional
responses and defensive behaviors that accompany perceptions of threat and interruption.
Fiske (1993) has proposed that power, including the power to interrupt another’s goals, affects the less powerful individual in a relationship by increasing his or her perspective taking,
a core component of threat regulation. Less powerful individuals engage in more perspective
taking because it is typically in their selfinterest to imagine and anticipate how powerful
others may interrupt their ability to reach valued end states. Power may influence the usefulness of engaging in threat-reducing behavior for
similar reasons. For instance, boundary spanners who engage in threat regulation processes
with powerful others may thereby decrease the
likelihood that they will suffer from the negative
emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear) and defensive behavior of those powerful others.
Organizational reward systems and task interdependence not only motivate threat regulation processes but also improve goal alignment
and provide a calculative reason for trusting
others. I propose that because organizational
reward systems and task interdependence align
goals, they can simultaneously motivate boundary spanners to engage in proactive threat regulation and increase counterparts’ willingness
to trust them.

Hypothesis 6a: The greater a counterpart’s power to interrupt an individual’s goal attainment, the greater that
individual’s threat regulation (perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior, reflection).
Hypothesis 6b: An individual’s threat
regulation will partially mediate the
positive relationship between a counterpart’s power (which aligns goals)
and the counterpart’s trust in that individual.
Interpersonal Context
The quality of interpersonal relationships represents another contextual factor that may influence threat regulation. Affective bonds, a central component of interpersonal relationships,
refer to experiences of feeling “joined, seen and
felt, known, and not alone” (Kahn, 1998: 39). They
influence threat regulation processes by fostering more considerate behavior. Affective bonds
increase the tendency to feel empathy, which, in
turn, increases considerate, prosocial behavior
(Batson, 1991).
In addition to its impact on threat regulation,
affect has a well-established direct influence on
trust (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; Lewis & Weigert,
1985; Williams, 2001). The affective bonds and
liking that boundary spanners and counterparts
share may influence trust in several ways. Affective bonds may positively bias the attributions counterparts make regarding a boundary
spanner’s behavior, may motivate counterparts
to use a less stringent criterion for evaluating
the boundary spanner’s trustworthiness, or may
promote prosocial behaviors that build trust
(Williams, 2001). I propose that boundary spanners’ experience of affective bonds will influence their motivation to engage in threatreducing behavior. At the same time, these
affective bonds will influence trust directly, because counterparts’ experiences of these bonds
will influence their perceptions of boundary
spanners’ trustworthiness and their trust in the
boundary spanners (i.e., Hypothesis 2).
Hypothesis 7: The stronger the affective bonds an individual feels for his
or her counterparts, the greater that
individual’s threat regulation (per-

spective taking, threat-reducing behavior, reflection).
DISCUSSION
Professionals working on interorganizational
projects must traverse organizational boundaries to secure the cooperation of people over
whom they have no hierarchical control. They
are faced with risks that can inhibit cooperation,
such as opportunism, neglect of interests, and
identity damage. In this article I attempt to
broaden our understanding of trust by examining two aspects of trust relationships that have
received little joint attention: human agency
and affect. In my threat regulation model, I examine interpersonal behaviors and psychological strategies required for human agency in
trust development, while recognizing the affective side of the risks inherent in many cooperative endeavors—the fear, apprehension, and
feelings of threat individuals experience when
they anticipate that harm may result from cooperation.
Although affect is a well-recognized predictor
of trust (e.g., Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995), the fear and apprehension that a counterpart associates with
cooperation have implications for active trust
building that are not well-understood. I argue
that by addressing counterparts’ anticipation of
harm responsively and proactively, threat regulation not only decreases these negative experiences but also influences trust in several
ways. Threat regulation processes influence
trust by affecting emotional responses, signaling trustworthiness (i.e., benevolence) and cooperative intent, representing social emotional
investments, and demonstrating social competencies (e.g., interpersonal understanding).
The three-step threat regulation process contributes to the trust literature by providing a
model for active trust development. Using a
framework for human agency from social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, 2001), this model integrates psychological processes for understanding and regulating emotion (e.g., Carver &
Scheier, 1998; Gross, 1998; Lazarus & Folkman,
1984; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985) with intersubjective processes from symbolic interactionism for
understanding and responding to others
(Blumer, 1969; Goffman, 1967; Mead, 1934). The
first step in threat regulation— cognitive ap-

615

praisal–related perspective taking—involves
forethought and an interpersonal understanding of the cognitions that caused the feelings of
threat that counterparts associate with cooperating. The second step in this process—threatreducing behavior— enables individuals to decrease others’ experiences of threat. The model
integrates specific emotion regulation processes, such as cognitive reframing, with the
interpersonal responsiveness of symbolic interactionism and the intentionality of social cognitive theory. The third step in the threat regulation process—reflection—is an essential selfassessment and self-corrective step consistent
with self-regulation processes in psychology
(e.g., Bandura, 1986; Carver & Scheier, 1998).
In the threat regulation model, I delineate not
only processes that foster both trust and affective attachment but also processes that are particularly relevant for building relationships in
cross-boundary contexts that may be associated
with additional threats to cooperation, such as
intergroup goal misalignment, status differences, and value conflict. On complex, ambiguous, and nonroutine projects, I suggest that the
need for threat regulation may be important for
maintaining trust throughout the duration of a
relationship, because new threats to a counterpart’s identity and goals, such as the need to
negotiate the solution to an unexpected contingency, may arise at unpredictable points over
the course of a project.
The model developed here also contributes to
our understanding of the role of emotion management in organizations. The management of
emotional expression during interpersonal interactions has received a significant amount of
attention in both sociology and organization
theory. This research, which focuses primarily
on emotional labor, reveals critical aspects of
service work and emotional life in organizations
(e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Grandey, 2003;
Hochschild, 1979; Martin et al., 1998; Morris &
Feldman, 1996; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989, 1990; Sutton, 1991; Van Mannen & Kunda, 1989). However,
the literature in this area has not focused on
collaborative outcomes.
The threat regulation model of trust represents an underexplored dimension of interpersonal emotion work. It builds on previous conceptualizations of emotional labor in three ways
that are particularly relevant for the collaborative nature of work in a less hierarchically struc-

<-----Page 21----->616

Academy of Management Review

tured, more knowledge-based economy. First,
emotional labor has traditionally involved conforming to “feeling rules” or “display rules” that
are easily observed, motivated, and rewarded
by a social group—the organization or the profession (e.g., Hochschild, 1983; Pierce, 1995; Sutton, 1991). In contrast, threat regulation is independently motivated by the need for cooperation
and often not directly sanctioned or rewarded by
the organization. For example, Fletcher (1999)
noted that behaviors such as empathetic teaching that can reduce interpersonal threat, promote cooperative learning, and facilitate organizational goals often go unrecognized and
unrewarded by organizations. Mirroring the nature of work in the knowledge-based economy,
threat regulation is a form of interpersonal emotion work that is often nonroutine, proactive, and
not easily observed or monitored. Therefore, it
may be more difficult to directly reward and
sanction than emotional expression in more routine service work.
Second, research on emotional labor has often
focused on emotional expression as the mechanism of interest for influencing the emotions of
others (e.g., Hochschild, 1983; Sutton, 1991). The
threat regulation model, in contrast, employs a
variety of cognitive, affective, and behavioral
strategies for managing the emotions of others,
such as cognitively reframing and behaviorally
altering the situation. Drawing on the psychological literature on emotion regulation, this
model complements and clarifies the psychological processes underlying the small but growing
body of work on the interpersonal emotion management outcomes of emotional labor in sociology (e.g., Francis, 1997; Lively, 2000; Thoits, 2004).
Third, the role of social norms and display
rules may be less prominent in threat regulation
processes than in the emotional labor processes
involved in routine service work. Threat regulation on cooperative projects occurs in professional settings that are typified by a wider latitude of discretion within emotional display
rules than is permissible in many types of routine service work. Therefore, understanding display rules may be necessary but not sufficient
for engaging in threat regulation. Interpersonal
emotional intelligence, especially emotional
knowledge about how feelings are generated
and influenced in other individuals and interpersonal understanding of specific individuals,
may be required for successful threat regulation

on collaborative projects. Investigating the
threat regulation dimension of interpersonal
emotion management may broaden the way researchers investigate the motivation for, the processes involved in, and the outcomes associated
with emotional labor in a knowledge work setting. As the knowledge intensity of the economy
increases, the need to coordinate less hierarchically structured work may not only increase the
importance of interpersonal trust in organizations (Adler, 2001) but also may increase the
importance of the collaborative potential of interpersonal emotion management.
DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The hypotheses in the threat regulation model
need to be tested in a variety of interorganizational and cross-functional settings, such as
R&D alliances, professional service relationships, joint ventures, technical consortia, and
cross-functional product development teams.
Qualitative research will be important for delineating the sets of threat-reducing behaviors
most often used by individuals in different realworld contexts (e.g., cross-functional teams,
R&D alliances). Experimental studies will be important for manipulating and measuring the
amount of threat that individuals associate with
cooperative endeavors, measuring the impact of
specific sets of threat-reducing strategies, and
understanding the effect of opportunistic intentions on the effectiveness of attempted threat
regulation.
Longitudinal research will enable researchers
to disentangle how time, threat regulation, and
interpersonal affective bonds influence trust development and maintenance in contexts with
differing initial levels of suspicion, animosity,
and positive affect. These studies should investigate not only the implications of threat regulation for trust but also threat regulation more
broadly, as an active strategy for developing the
closely related, team-level constructs of relationship quality and psychological safety—
constructs that foster the championing of difficult issues, openness around organizational
problems and errors, and other organizational
outcomes.
Finally, a combination of methods will be necessary to establish threat regulation as an active, intentional process. To do this, it will be
important to establish not only that one individ-

<-----Page 22----->2007

Williams

ual’s threat-regulating actions influence another’s perceptions of threat, trust, and cooperation
but also that individuals hold mental models
that include threat regulation as a viable strategy for building trust. Mental models undergird
intentional behavior because individuals will
only purposely choose to engage in threatregulating actions in an effort to build trust and
cooperation if they hold mental models with
cause-and- effect links from threat regulation to
trust and cooperation.
CONCLUSION
It is a challenge to traverse organizational
boundaries to secure the cooperation of people
over whom one has no hierarchical control. In
contrast to current models of trust development,
I have proposed that boundary-spanning individuals working on interdependent knowledgebased projects do not wait to be found trustworthy but, instead, actively seek the trust and
cooperation they need from others to accomplish
their interdependent goals. I argued that active
trust seeking is necessary because of the harm
that counterparts may associate with cooperation— opportunism, neglect of interests, and
identity damage.
A major contribution of this article is the introduction of the multistep process of threat regulation as a form of interpersonal emotion management and the proposition that perspective
taking, threat-reducing behavior, and reflection
are the three steps that constitute this process. A
second contribution is the model linking threat
regulation to interpersonal trust and cooperation. I proposed that threat regulation builds
and maintains trust not only by influencing
emotion, an antecedent to trust, but also by signaling one’s own trustworthiness, demonstrating one’s social competence (e.g. interpersonal
understanding), and making a social emotional
investment that fosters trustworthy behavior.
Through this article, I seek to motivate empirical
tests and a more precise understanding of threat
regulation and its relationship to trust and collaboration.
