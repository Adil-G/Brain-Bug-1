In terms of size and scope of operations, The
Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) is clearly
one of the premier land grant, research-intensive
universities in the country, and also boasts one of
the largest unified outreach networks in American
higher education. Founded in 1855 as a small agricultural college, it became the state’s sole land grant
institution in 1863 following the passage of the
Morrill Act in 1862. The university began to experience significant growth early in the 20th century. By
the 1930s, it was well along in establishing a
statewide presence through undergraduate education, its agricultural extension activities, and its educational and assistance outreach in other areas.
Since then, Penn State has expanded to become a
world-class university with a three-part mission:
education, research, and service. However, that mission is construed to place a heavy emphasis on outreach and external partnering.
The main campus is located at University Park,
Pennsylvania, where approximately 40,000 students
are enrolled. Over the years and in partnership with
the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Penn State has
developed an extensive system of branch campuses
and affiliated institutions. These are now located in
24 locations, covering every region of the state, and
enroll an additional 40,000 students. There are more
than 427,000 alumni of Penn State, making it one of
the more visible and esteemed institutions in the
country, and its presence in the state is pervasive.
According to a recent State of the University speech1
by President Graham Spanier,“one out of every two
households in Pennsylvania has a person participating in a Penn State program,” including cooperative
extension, resident, continuing and distance
education, service, and research.

Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

In the FY 1999 survey of academic research and development expenditures by the National Science Foundation2
Penn State reported research expenditures of $379.4 million. This ranked 14th among all U.S. universities and
ninth among public universities. Penn State has consistently ranked among the top 10 universities in the number
of faculty who win prestigious Fulbright Scholarships for study abroad. Numerous Penn State faculty hold membership in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, or Medicine. Penn State is considered world class in
acoustics research (an outgrowth of work with the Navy) and in the study of advanced materials, specifically electronic-semiconductor materials, diamond and diamond-like materials, polymers, ceramics, powdered metallurgy,
and biomaterials. In the emerging discipline that intersects the life sciences and information technology Penn State
is developing competencies in bioinfomatics. The Department of Geography has been ranked number one in the
United States by the National Research Council (NRC). The university has historic strength in plant and animal
biotechnology research. It also has outstanding programs in the colleges of Engineering, Agricultural Sciences,
Earth and Mineral Sciences, Health and Human Development, and the Eberly College of Science. The recently established Life Sciences Consortium pulls together expertise from a wide array of units and disciplines across the campus. There is also a Materials Research Institute, a Children, Youth, and Families Consortium, and an Environmental
Consortium, all of which report directly to the vice president for research and are campus-wide in scope. In fact,
nearly one-third of Penn State’s research is interdisciplinary in nature, and is organized through either Intercollege
Research Programs (IRP) or the Applied Research Laboratory. This encouragement of interdisciplinary research
also is reflected in the role that the university plays in economic development and community outreach.
Penn State is an example of an institution that is the dominant publicly supported university in its home state,
along with being a land grant school, and which has very self-consciously taken on the mission of fostering economic and social development as an integral theme in everything it does. Moreover, its reach in performing this
mission cuts across disciplines, activities, and sub-regions of the state. It is clearly an “engaged university” as discussed in the introductory chapter.

Mission, Vision, and Goal Statements

Penn State leadership has quite clearly articulated the role that the university should play in societal betterment.
Interestingly, this role is portrayed as being complementary to more traditional responsibilities in education and
scholarship. In a recent campus publication, appropriately titled Integrated Impact,3 Penn State’s president is quoted as follows:

I believe that we can and should be identified as the leading model of how a university simultaneously provides excellence in undergraduate education; graduate education; research, scholarship, and creative activity;
technolog y transfer and promotion of economic development; continuing and distance education; cooperative extension; public and professional service; the promotion of health and human development; and the
cultural advancement of our society.
These general themes are echoed and restated by various units on campus, particularly those that have a more visible role in relating to Pennsylvania economic development. For example, the Industrial Research Office states the
university mission as:

To improve the lives of people in Pennsylvania, the nation, and the world through integrated programs in
teaching, research, and public service.
2

<-----Page 4----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

Similarly, in a sidebar introduction to a brochure4 on the Penn State Innovation Park, President Spanier (who chairs
its governing board) again reiterates the theme, as follows:

The Penn State Research Park encourages a close working relationship between the University and the business community. We are pleased to expand and enhance our role in economic development through the
Research Park and to include industr y representatives in our extended University family.

We’re doing more of it today – we have our antenna up when there’s a faculty member’s research that may
have potential in the commercial sector. In the past, many faculty may never have seen their research outside
of the lab.
These illustrations do not exhaust the use of mission and goal statements to articulate the outreach role in the Penn
State context. Two themes, in particular, are worth noting about these statements and other mission language. One
is the concept of integration between the external outreach activities and on-campus education, research, and
scholarship. In effect, making a difference in the “real world” is portrayed as integral to the Penn State experience.
Second is the extent to which practical impact is not seen as the exclusive domain of engineering and the sciences.
Rather, outreach in areas such as education and health improvement is similarly valued. For example, another university publicationl6 from Penn State Research and Technology Transfer provides 39 pages, organized region-byregion, of nearly 100 Penn State research projects that have made a difference in areas as diverse as environmental
remediation, substance abuse, rural health care, and Alzheimer’s disease. On a Web page7 reachable through the
main university site are described 19 ways (“a sample”) that Penn State makes life better for residents of the state,
which again spans the gamut from conducting research, to training doctors for Pennsylvania, to reaching out to
inner-city youth.

Industry Research Partnerships

NSF data8 indicate that Penn State’s industry-sponsored research expenditures in FY 1999 were $65.7 million, or
17.3% of total research expenditures. In 1992, they were 15.3% of total research expenditures, indicating a commendable increase in an already excellent level of performance. Between 1992 and 1999, overall research expenditures increased by 36% while industry-sponsored expenditures increased by 54%. The percent of FY 1999 industry-sponsored expenditures was above the national average of 7.4% and ranked fifth among the top 100 U.S. universities. Nationally, among top-50 research universities, Penn State has been ranked in the top three, with Duke
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for industry-sponsored research and development expenditures. In contrast to many universities, about half of industry-sponsored research at Penn State involves
Pennsylvania companies. In FY1999, 367 Pennsylvania companies supported 648 projects at Penn State. Not surprisingly, there is a well-developed structure for managing industry research and an attempt to be “customerfriendly” in terms of policies and procedures concerning industry research partnerships.
The Industrial Research Office (www.research.psu.edu/iro) functions as the primary point of entry for Penn State
research partnerships with industry. The IRO is located within the Office of the Vice President for Research, reporting through the assistant vice president for research and technology transfer. It is currently staffed by a senior
director, a contract specialist, two professional staff who function as liaisons to industrial clients, and two administrative support staff. The mission of the IRO is straightforward:
3

Penn State

He has also lent the legitimating mantle of his office to the increased efforts of the university to commercialize faculty-developed technology and to partner with industry:5

<-----Page 5----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

Penn State

To establish long-term, mutually beneficial relationships between Penn State, industr y, and government in
order to stimulate cooperative research activities.
The list of partnership-stimulating activities is extensive. The office undertakes several facilitating activities,
including organizing visits by faculty and students to companies, hosting company visits to the campus, linking
faculty to companies around major programs or smaller projects, and maintaining databases of faculty capacities.
For example, Penn State works with the Community of Science (COS) to maintain an online database of faculty
areas of expertise. This is available gratis to faculty at Penn State and at other institutions that participate in COS,
and for companies that subscribe to the COS service.
The IRO, as a function of its service to industry (and faculty), will do COS searches. It publishes (hard copy and
online) a Penn State Research and Technology Directory, which lists over 200 research centers and laboratories,
including a contact person, phone and fax numbers, and an Internet address. In addition, a company can download
from the IRO Web site a “Request for Information” form, specify its needs and interests, and fax it to the office.
The office also develops directories of Penn State capacities in specialized domains of research. A recent effort was
an 82 page Environmental Research Directory that describes faculty members’ interests and expertise, as well as
the foci and capacities of centers, institutes, and laboratories. Complete contact information is also provided, and
the document has been widely disseminated to potential sponsors in government agencies and industry. The IRO
also publishes a CD-ROM with all of the above information plus intellectual property available for licensing. In
addition, the IRO enables industry to access research facilities like the Nanofabrication users facility, and the
national Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EBPVD) coating center.
The IRO is generally viewed as the “marketing and sales” function for science and technology within the university.
In this context the IRO makes industry aware of intellectual property available for license, research talent, and facilities. The IRO also packages the resulting partnership. It does the early stage negotiations and nondisclosure
agreements and assists in proposal preparation. This effort greatly enhances the win rate with industry and adds
considerable value to the industry/university partnership. The IRO functions as the liaison with the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania in securing leverage funding for technology development through the array of economic development incentive programs.
The IRO has crafted several “special” partnerships with firms using master agreements that broadly define the relationship and provide for an enhanced oversight relationship. This effort is not unlike “affiliates” programs at other
institutions. However, the liaison service that Penn State provides to industry is free. When mutual interest has
been determined, and a connection established between a company and a Penn State researcher, the IRO also plays
a role in facilitating contracting procedures.
There are more than 180 centers and consortia that are to some degree industry-sponsored at Penn State. The centers focus on all aspects of Penn State research competencies. IRO plays an active role in the formation of the centers by assisting in the crafting of the industrial agreements and operating documents. The IRO also assists in the
identification of state and federal funding resources and in proposal preparation. Perhaps the most important role
for the IRO in center formation, however, is in the identification and nurturing of potential industrial sponsors.
Penn State has been active and successful in using master agreements, particularly with those companies that have
long-term multiproject relationships with the university. The Industry Master Agreement is a protocol that the IRO
developed several years ago to enhance research and tech-transfer partnerships with industry. The agreements
4

<-----Page 6----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

provide for a menu of options for sponsored work and captures issues generic to the partnership up front. For
example, one such agreement calls for establishing an oversight team of corporate and university officials charged
with monitoring the partnership, a process for solicitation and evaluation of proposals, a comprehensive approach
to new project development, and IRO-dedicated management of the overall relationship. This particular relationship resulted in $1.5 million in sponsored research this year.

In fact, all of Penn State’s main campus activities in research administration, research and technology development,
industrial liaison, business incubation, business development, technical assistance and commercialization activities
are under one roof under one command in the Innovation Park. This represents a powerful tool in technologybased economic development. This cluster also allows internal and external constituents (customers) a one-stop
access to Penn State resources and research opportunities.

Technology Transfer

License income was $2.83 million in FY 1999, for a royalty return on investment (royalties as a percent of total
research expenditures) of 0.76%. License income ranks in the 72nd percentile, and royalty ROI ranks in the 51st
percentile of the 142 academic institutions that participated in the AUTM Licensing Survey: 1999.9 Penn State
reported 30 new licenses to start-up companies in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 combined, placing it in the 86th percentile in the total AUTM licensing survey for this measure. Penn State reported eight new start-ups formed in the
same period, seven of which were in state. Penn State ranks in the 84th percentile for total start-ups formed and in
the 85th percentile for in-state start-ups formed. These results reflect the activities of the technology transfer
office, the research strengths of the institution, and the increasingly robust infrastructure in support of commercialization through start-ups.
Since start-up companies are particularly important for anchoring economic development benefits within the state,
it would be useful to point out some of the relevant recent changes in university policies and practices of the
Intellectual Property Office. For example, the establishment of the Research Commercialization Office was clearly
an attempt to accentuate the start-up mission with a new set of operating philosophies and policies.
EIEICO Inc. is an example of how the approach can work effectively. The company was established based on licenses to a “technology platform” of three patented Penn State inventions with product applications in the meat and
dairy industries. Title to the inventions is held by Penn State Research Foundation (PSRF), and PSRF will retain an
equity interest in EIEICO, the start-up licensee. Faculty members and students involved in original development of
the inventions will receive a portion of any economic gain. The company’s investors and management will hold the
5

Penn State

Another asset that fosters industry research sponsorship is Penn State Innovation Park. In its current configuration, the park offers 118 acres of space to companies large and small. The first buildings were opened in 1994, and
the first privately developed multi-tenant building was completed in 1998. A second multi-tenant building is under
construction. In addition to space for companies, the park also has the Penn Stater Conference Center Hotel, with
accommodations for meetings of up to 1,500 participants. The park has fiber-optic connectivity throughout and
ready access to regional transportation links. Preference for tenancy is given to companies with a strong interest or
track record in collaborating with Penn State in research, education, or training. There are currently 38 tenants in
the park, including those in the business incubator. These tenants employ more than 750 individuals. Of note,
Penn State’s entire Technology Transfer Organization (Ben Franklin Technology Center, Industrial Research Office,
Intellectual Property Office, PENNTAP, the Research Commercialization Office, and the Small Business
Development Center) is also located in the park. This centralized access is attractive to tenant companies, as well as
to the industry community in general.

<-----Page 7----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

Penn State

remaining ownership interest. EIEICO will operate as a parent company and establish subsidiary companies for the
portfolio of licensed inventions. Dr. Eva J. Pell, vice president for research and dean of the graduate school, says,
“This new model for technology transfer, in which related inventions are bundled into the same start-up company,
offers those who invest in EIEICO a higher probability of seeing a winner. It also aligns the interests of the inventors
and the university with those of the financial and management shareholders.”
The university will benefit from this arrangement by fulfilling its outreach mission and providing products and
economic benefit for the public good. In addition, the university has the potential of realizing additional financial
gain from the downstream sale of its equity interest.

Industrial Extension/Technical Assistance

Penn State is home to one of the “granddaddies” of the university-affiliated industrial outreach programs.
Established in 1965, the Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program (PENNTAP) has provided technical assistance
services to more than 20,000 clients throughout the state. The services are provided free, and the clients are small
manufacturers (48%) and other businesses. The assistance generally involves a mix of short-term technical counseling, technical information and information search services, and referrals to other sources of expertise. PENNTAP has won several awards for excellence from both national and state organizations.
In 1999, PENNTAP provided 900 cases of technical assistance to 620 clients in all 67 counties of the state. Those
clients reported $9.9 billion in economic impact, and 310 jobs created or retained. The annual budget for the program is $1.5 million, of which about half comes from Penn State, and the balance from state and federal agency
support. As an unusual expression of mission alignment, Penn State’s monetary support comes out of its own
budget, not as a pass-through of a state grant or contract. As in most states, there is a Manufacturing Extension
Program (MEP) in Pennsylvania, which is also supported by federal and state sources (plus client fees). PENNTAP
is not formally part of MEP but does have subcontractor partnership agreements with most of the MEP centers.
The PENNTAP staff consists of 10 technical specialists, a technical librarian, administrative support staff, and a few
part-time student assistants. All of the technical specialists who work directly with companies have particular
areas of expertise as well as industry experience, and all are employees of Penn State. The PENNTAP director
reports to the assistant vice president for research and director of technology transfer. This gives the program a
campus-wide mandate to seek appropriate expertise, which it would not have if located within a single academic
unit.
The technical areas in which PENNTAP provides assistance run the gamut of needs that are typically experienced in
manufacturing (e.g., materials handling, metal forming and fabrication, industrial engineering) but also extend to
areas such as forest products, environmental issues, occupational safety and health, product development, and statistical analysis. Only three of the 10 technical specialists work out of the University Park campus; the balance of staff
members are based at other Penn State campuses or in offices at MEP partner organizations. Nonetheless, the PENNTAP technical staff coordinate their own efforts and with efforts of other service providers through e-mail, by regular personal contact, and by participating in regional service provider network meetings. Illustrative of the scope of
internal coordination, in 1999 nearly 30% of PENNTAP’s 900 cases involved PENNTAP technical specialists getting
help from other PENNTAP specialists to formulate a response to the client. Also, 40 cases were referred from one
PENNTAP technical specialist to another because of more appropriate expertise or geographic proximity. In terms of
external coordination, in 1999 33% of PENNTAP’s cases were the result of referrals to PENNTAP from other organizations. Similarly, about one-third of PENNTAP cases involved referring clients to other organizations or resources
for additional or extended assistance beyond the assistance provided by the PENNTAP technical specialist.
6

<-----Page 8----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

In most academic departments in which faculty or students frequently get involved in PENNTAP, these assignments
are considered worthwhile and consistent with the research, education, and service goals of the unit. Faculty members report that they use their interactions with PENNTAP clients as examples in their classroom instruction. In
addition, the program itself has hosted a reception for faculty members and staff, to acknowledge 300 individuals
who had provided assistance to clients. Each person received a personalized certificate, and the president of the
university and a senior official from state government both gave laudatory speeches.
One important strength of the program has been its fairly disciplined approach to gathering evaluation data from
clients. This involves systematic follow-up and the development of statistical profiles of outcomes. The performance measurement and evaluation system has received a best-practice designation from the U.S. Economic
Development Administration.
Several things are noteworthy about Penn State’s industrial extension activities. One, it almost surely will have
long-term fiscal and political support. PENNTAP seems to be a permanent part of the Penn State organizational
landscape, which has interesting implications for maintaining a culture for involvement in economic development.
Second, it has a relatively prominent organizational home. That is, rather than being hidden in a department or
college, where it might be vulnerable to the budgetary exigencies and disciplinary constraints at that level, it has a
much wider mandate. Third, it is operationally integrated with other technology-oriented outreach functions, as
has been elaborated elsewhere in this chapter. Fourth, PENNTAP has been able, in most cases, to offer these services gratis to state-based companies. Few assistance programs elsewhere in the country can make the same claim.

Entrepreneurial Development

Despite the fact that Penn State is physically isolated from national centers of commerce (or maybe because of that
circumstance), it has made significant progress in developing a physical and programmatic infrastructure for
entrepreneurial development. Much of this activity is centered at Innovation Park but it also involves the active collaboration with and support from several organizational entities on campus and in the community. This cooperation is basically institutionalized because virtually all of those entities report to the same assistant vice president.
In 1998, the university formed a new Research Commercialization Office designed to focus Penn State’s efforts in
fostering start-up companies based on research-generated technology. The office works on identifying, assisting,
and accelerating commercial opportunities resulting from knowledge created by faculty, staff, and students. A key
component of the assistance is the encouragement of seed investment in Penn State commercialization projects
7

Penn State

While clients are not charged for assistance services, any engagement is limited to 20 hours of contact time (excluding travel). On rare occasions fees will be charged for additional specialized services. In some cases, a company’s
problem will be sufficiently complex that a referral will be made to a faculty member, another program, a federal
lab, or a trade association. These additional resources may involve a fee, which is negotiated between the company
and the service provider. Out of 900 assistance engagements in 1999, 140 involved referrals to Penn State faculty,
staff, or students outside the program. In most cases, Penn State faculty will provide assistance at no cost or
arrange for the involvement of a graduate student at a very nominal cost. Occasionally, an assistance engagement
will lead to a contract research project. In these cases, the IRO may play a role in identifying appropriate faculty
and/or facilitating the contract arrangements. In addition to the hands-on technical assistance, PENNTAP also provides customized technical information searches. These are also free, and a client company may send to the program a technical information search request, specifying the kinds of information desired, key words, and potential
publications to search. There is typically some back-and-forth interaction to verify the nature of the search before
the program will deliver a product, usually within a week or two.

<-----Page 9----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

Penn State

from angel investors or venture capital firms.
The Research Commercialization Office works closely with two local technology business incubators. Facility management is provided by an economic development organization in the community, and both incubators involve
companies with strong connections to Penn State. The Zetachron Center for Science and Technology Business
Development is a 10,700-square-foot wet lab facility and currently houses seven companies. Companies include:
Centre Ingredient Technologies, a producer of natural flavors and fragrances; Mitotyping Technologies, a mitochondrial DNA lab servicing the criminal justice market; Salimetrics, a producer of non-isotropic immunoassays for
research and development testing labs; and EIEICO, a company commercializing three technologies in the agricultural market. The second incubator, located in the Penn State Research Park, houses 12 tenant companies representing a wide range of industries. Companies include: The Forecast Institute, specializing in weather prediction
software; Lomic Incorporated, a producer of gas metering software products; Licom Inc., a developer of fiber-optic
technology products; and eight different Internet-related service providers. Of the 19 tenant companies, approximately half have resulted from a knowledge base emanating from Penn State or a licensed technology from Penn
State’s Intellectual Property Office. The majority of the companies actively employs or utilizes undergraduate and
graduate student interns in their staffing strategy. Several incubator graduate companies have hired their former
interns or Penn State graduates.
A third asset for entrepreneurial development is the regional office of the Ben Franklin Partnership (BFP), which is
also located in the Penn State Research Park. This is a statewide $25 million program at four centers, one of which
is based at Penn State. For existing companies, the program can provide funding (on a competitive basis) for projects that typically focus on process or product improvement. For the university, the program can partially support
an industry-oriented center or institute. For start-up companies, the program can support the development of a
promising technology into a working prototype. Only a small fraction of projects directly involve the commercialization of Penn State technology, but nonetheless university faculty and students are involved in several aspects of
BFP program activities, ranging from working on projects to reviewing proposals for potential funding. Again,
because of the co-location of this program with the other technology transfer offices, there are numerous opportunities for leveraging among the programs. Locating the program in the Penn State Research Park also sends a clear
message to the region and the state that this is an important part of the university’s mission.
Although less focused on high-tech companies, Penn State’s Small Business Development Center (SBDC) serves a
variety of companies in a contiguous multi-county area. The center is staffed with three permanent employees,
three student employees, and an outside consultant. It is funded by a mix of monies from the state’s Department of
Community and Economic Development and from Penn State. Organizationally, the SBDC reports to PENNTAP
(see above) and in turn to the vice president for research. The center provides a wide variety of business assistance
services and training often with help from university faculty or staff. Most of the services are delivered free of
charge or for a modest fee. The latter are coordinated through Penn State’s Office of Outreach and Cooperative
Extension.

Industry Education and Training Partnerships

Penn State provides a wide variety of industry-focused education and training offerings, either through its branch
campus system, via distance learning, or in the form of new industry-oriented degree programs. Among the latter
is the formation of a new School of Information Sciences and Technology. The school was launched in response to
urgent workforce shortages in the information industries, both in Pennsylvania and nationally. Industry executives,
who emphasized the need for management and communication skills as well as technical expertise, guided development of the program. Almost 600 students are enrolled in the school, about 200 at University Park and the rest at
8

<-----Page 10----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

branch campus locations. The IST school has significant industrial support and has a guaranteed placement of all
of its first class in a highly competitive IT industry. A four-year baccalaureate degree is available at the University
Park campus and other selected locations. Other campuses also offer the two-year associate degree. Master’s and
Ph.D. programs will be available in the near future, as will IST certificate programs. IST students who cannot study
in residence also have access to courses and certificate programs via Penn State’s World Campus, a Web-based
interface for providing anytime/anywhere learning.

Penn State has created a first-of-a kind in the state (and one of a very few in the United States) Semiconductor
Training Program in the Innovation Park facility. This two-year associate degree program prepares technicians to
work in clean-room environments within the semiconductor industry. The first three semesters are offered at
many of the community colleges and branch campuses across the state with the final semester in the clean room at
the University Park campus. Technicians are trained on state-of-the-art equipment (e.g., an operational six-inch
wafer line and a class 10 clean room). This $20 million facility is part of the nano-fabrication users facility, a
National Science Foundation funded industry/university research consortium with a focus on next generation “system on a chip” prototype products and processes. A second unique program resides within the Sintered Materials
Center whose technology and research focus relates to the powdered metals industry. This industry is uniquely
clustered in Pennsylvania where it manufactures more than 39% of the world’s powdered metal parts. The center is
another example of industry/university/state government partnership with over 80 industry partners, and $1 million in state funding support. The center boasts a field training and technology assistance site located at the Penn
State Campus in Dubois. The Dubois center is located in the heart of the powdered metals industry cluster where
approximately 4,000 workers are employed in more than 40 firms.

Career Services and Placement

The Eberly College of Science, the Smeal College of Business, the College of Engineering, and the School of
Information Sciences and Technology have cooperative education and internship programs for undergraduates. In
the College of Engineering, 48% of the nearly 1,000 students who participate in the cooperative education program
work for companies in Pennsylvania. The College of Engineering staff works with the high-tech councils in eastern
and western Pennsylvania to establish co-ops, internships, and jobs for Penn State students. Staff members also
work with the Chamber of Business and Industry of Centre County (CBICC) and the Private Industry Council of
Centre County (PICCC) to develop local opportunities for University Park students.
While the career fairs at the University Park campus usually host national companies, Commonwealth Campuses
tend to invite regionally based companies. In the fall of 2002, the Office of Career Services will host a special career
fair called “@pgh.cafe” (http://www.tc-p.com/atpgh.cfm), sponsored by Pittsburgh Technology Council and
Pittsburgh companies.
Penn State also intersects with industry on issues of human resources via statewide programmatic initiatives. The
state of Pennsylvania has programs in place that encourage workforce development in key industrial sectors that
have a high potential for growth. These programs are tied to the technology development initiatives described
9

Penn State

The branch campus system at Penn State provides affordability to students who must stay in their community for
personal and financial reasons and allows for programmatic flexibility at the local level in response to workforce
demands in industry. For example the Penn State Erie Campus (Behrend College) offers degrees in plastics and
advanced materials technology in response to the significant industry cluster in the region; the Dubois campus of
Penn State offers programs in powdered metal technology; the Mont Alto campus offers forest products; and the
Capital Campus in Harrisburg offers degree programs in environmental science and technology.

<-----Page 11----->Innovation U.: New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy

above. The industry clusters that predominate in this investment strategy include plastics, tool and die, powdered
metals, advanced materials (semiconductors and ceramics), biotechnology and the life sciences, environmental science and technology, and information technology.

Penn State

Many of the programs at Penn State reflect both technology opportunity and human resource needs. Examples
include the Semiconductor Manufacturing Training Program, the Information Science and Technology Program,
the Sintered Materials/Powdered Materials Program, the Plastics Technology Development/Deployment Centers
Program, and the e-Business Resource Program.

Formal Partnerships with Economic Development
Organizations

Contrasted with many other institutions, Penn State’s formal partnerships with state and local economic development organizations are probably more operational and real than symbolic. It has a long fiscal and operational partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding existing programs and has been at the policy table for
many years as the state has developed new programs to address economic development in the knowledge economy.
Its role and visibility among the state’s political and economic development leadership is of long standing, and has
generally transcending party and ideology.
Penn State officials hold memberships in and participate on various committees of the Pennsylvania Chamber of
Business and Industry and the Pennsylvania Economic Development Association, for example. The university is
also heavily engaged with the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in both program implementation and policy development. As previously mentioned, the university administers one of the
state’s four Ben Franklin Technology Centers, which supports industrial technology development, as well as PENNTAP (Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program). The university also participates in a variety of economic policy planning activities, such as Pennsylvania’s Technology 21 planning process completed last year, and is a member
of the Pennsylvania Technology Investment Authority.
In addition to this interface with statewide economic development organizations, Penn State officials also work with
a wide variety of local and regional economic development organizations across the state. Pennsylvania has more
than 1,500 local and regional community and economic development organizations. These include county and
municipal economic development offices, county industrial development corporations and authorities, small business development centers, regional planning and development commissions, housing and redevelopment authorities, community action agencies, private industry councils, Ben Franklin Technology Centers, industrial resource
centers, and many others. With nearly 100 Penn State campuses and extension offices, the university has a presence
in every one of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Through these locations, Penn State officials help provide leadership on
a daily basis to these and other types of economic development organizations. Correspondingly, many of these
organizations are represented on Penn State campus and Cooperative Extension advisory boards throughout the
state.

Industry/University Advisory Boards and Councils

There are more than180 industry-driven research and technology development centers and laboratories whose
research and strategic agenda is in part or predominately developed by industry boards and center members, as
well as academic units with strong ties to industry. For example all departments within the College of Engineering
have strong industry and professional advisory councils (IPACs) that help the department develop programs, curriculum, and research that are relevant to market demand. The IPACs consist of industry leaders in the field, key
10

professional societies representing the discipline, and key alumni.

Still others include the Penn State Berks Food Manufacturers Training Consortium which addresses workforce
training needs of more than 20 major Pennsylvania food processing companies in and around Berks County,
Pennsylvania, and the Penn State York Industrial Training Consortium, which provides workforce training programs for six of the largest industrial employers in York County, Pennsylvania. Finally, Penn State has been instrumental in helping to develop consortia independent of the university in new industry sectors. An example here is
the 100-member Pennsylvania Biotechnology Association, which was started within Penn State but now serves the
statewide interests of this industry. Through these types of advisory boards, councils, and consortia, Penn State is
able to extend its research and education capabilities to thousands of Pennsylvania companies beyond the 368
firms that directly sponsored research at the university last year.

Faculty Culture and Rewards

In addition to the many examples of mission language and public advocacy in support of an aggressive outreach
posture for Penn State, there are many informal examples of units and colleges supporting faculty involvement in
economic development activities and programs. There also are instances of formal acknowledgement programs
and a more positive consideration of these activities in tenure and promotion considerations. For example, the
office of the vice president for research and the Penn State Research Foundation held a Penn State Inventors
Reception in recognition of the 46 patents issued to more than 100 faculty, staff, and students during 1999.
Perhaps the best expression of cultural support for many of the activities described in this chapter is found in the
outreach and cooperative extension function of the institution. Headed by a vice president, it publishes a quarterly
magazine, Outreach, that documents the community improvement work of Penn State faculty and staff around the
state. In 1990 the unit published a plan10 for strengthening the outreach function, which received wide visibility
both on campus and around the state.
In addition, there have been extensive recent discussions on campus trying to reshape the definition of scholarship,
as well as to address the issue of faculty rewards for outreach. A group entitled the University Scholarship and
Criteria for Outreach and Performance Evaluation (UniSCOPE) learning community has released a report11 that
calls for considering the three mission areas of the University – teaching, research, and service – as alternative
forms of scholarship, each with its dimensions of excellence and modes of recognition. Technical assistance and
consultation are considered as viable types of activity, patents and licenses are considered appropriate vehicles for
delivering research scholarship, and corporations are a legitimate “target student” audience. In parallel, a Faculty
Senate Committee on Outreach Activities has convened and recommended policies that will define outreach, recommend evaluation methods and criteria, and suggest approaches to recognition and rewards. Obviously these

Penn State

Penn State has helped to organize and manage a wide variety of industry advisory boards, councils, and consortia.
For example, one of the newest is the Transportation Research and Education Consortium established this year in
partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania industry to address public and
private research and education needs in the transportation sector. Others examples of industry-driven centers
include the Center for Innovative Sintered Products with more than 70 industry members; the Pennsylvania
Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology Partnership, governed by an advisory board comprised of leading
semiconductor manufacturing firms; the Penn State Erie Plastics Technology Center, with more than 70 industry
members; the 35-member Pennsylvania Housing Research Center which promotes better and more affordable
housing for Pennsylvanians through technology; and the 30-member Penn State Center for Excellence in Metal
Casting, developed in partnership with the Pennsylvania Foundrymen’s Association.

two groups have complementary and perhaps overlapping tasks; one likely result should be a clarification of Penn
State’s culture and rewards regarding outreach, including the industry partnerships that have been described in this
chapter.
