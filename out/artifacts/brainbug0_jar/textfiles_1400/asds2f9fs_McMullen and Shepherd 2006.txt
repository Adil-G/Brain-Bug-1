ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION AND THE ROLE
OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE THEORY OF THE
ENTREPRENEUR

By considering the amount of uncertainty perceived and the willingness to bear
uncertainty concomitantly, we provide a more complete conceptual model of entrepreneurial action that allows for examination of entrepreneurial action at the individual level of analysis while remaining consistent with a rich legacy of system-level
theories of the entrepreneur. Our model not only exposes limitations of existing
theories of entrepreneurial action but also contributes to a deeper understanding of
important conceptual issues, such as the nature of opportunity and the potential for
philosophical reconciliation among entrepreneurship scholars.

ble opportunities for profit (e.g., Begley & Boyd,
1987; Sarasvathy, 2001a; Shane, 2000; Shaver &
Scott, 1991). Like before, entrepreneurial action
takes center stage, but this time more in terms of
how it occurs and who does it than whether it
occurs.
The conceptual overlap of these approaches
suggests that they are complementary. In fact, researchers of the individual-level approach have
frequently borrowed from theories grounded in
the system-level approach (e.g., Kaish & Gilad,
1991). However, this can lead scholars to rely on
models of entrepreneurial action that are incomplete when applied at a level of analysis other
than that intended by the theorist. Accordingly,
our purpose in this article is twofold. First, we
demonstrate that economic theories of the entrepreneur are theories of action proposing those elements that enhance and hinder individuals from
acting entrepreneurially. Although these models
may be sufficient for examining entrepreneurial
action at the system level, they can collapse when
applied at the individual level, making them susceptible to confounded theorizing and inconclusive or misleading empirical findings. This necessitates our second purpose: to offer a perspective
that allows for examination of entrepreneurial action at the individual level of analysis while remaining consistent with a rich legacy of systemlevel theories of the entrepreneur.
Because action takes place over time, and because the future is unknowable, action is inher-

Entrepreneurship requires action. Whether
conceptualized as the creation of new products
or processes (Schumpeter, 1934), entry into new
markets (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), or the creation
of new ventures (Gartner, 1985), entrepreneurship typically involves a mesolevel phenomenon in which personal initiative influences
system-wide activity and outcomes (Kilby, 1971;
Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990). To be an entrepreneur,
therefore, is to act on the possibility that one has
identified an opportunity worth pursuing.
Theories of entrepreneurship that embrace
this perspective traditionally have taken one of
two forms. The first form is devoted to a systemlevel approach concerned primarily with how
the economic system functions. Proponents of
these theories argue that the health of the economy depends on the pursuit of opportunities by
prospective entrepreneurs (e.g., Kirzner, 1973;
Schumpeter, 1934). Who acts is inconsequential
as long as someone does. Thus, the central issue
is whether entrepreneurial action occurs. The
second form is devoted to an individual-level
approach concerned primarily with how prospective entrepreneurs go about acting. These
researchers seek to explain why some individuals are more likely than others to pursue possi-

ently uncertain (Mises, 1949). This uncertainty is
further enhanced by the novelty intrinsic to entrepreneurial actions (Amabile, 1997; Smith &
DiGregorio, 2002), such as the creation of new
products, new services, new ventures, and so
forth (Gartner, 1990; Schumpeter, 1934). Therefore, it is no surprise that uncertainty constitutes
a conceptual cornerstone for most theories of the
entrepreneur. However, the role this uncertainty
plays in preventing entrepreneurial action has
remained a matter of debate. As a result, two
research streams have emerged, each inspired
by alternative conceptualizations of uncertainty.
The first stream focuses on the amount of uncertainty perceived and frequently discriminates those who decide to act entrepreneurially
from those who do not as a matter of differences
in knowledge (e.g., Busenitz, 1996; Gaglio & Katz,
2001; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Kirzner, 1979). Thus,
the amount of uncertainty is considered to be
the barrier between prospective entrepreneurs
and entrepreneurial action. The second stream
highlights the willingness to bear uncertainty
and typically proposes that those who decide to
act entrepreneurially are distinguishable from
those who do not owing to differences in motivation, attitude, or risk propensity (e.g., Douglas
& Shepherd, 2000; Knight, 1921; Schumpeter,
1934). In this scenario, an unwillingness to bear
uncertainty is deemed responsible for preventing prospective entrepreneurs from engaging in
entrepreneurial action.
Because an individual must ultimately act to
become an entrepreneur, and because action
involves knowledge and motivation (Higgins &
Kruglanski, 2000), we propose that each stream
merely emphasizes a different aspect of the uncertainty experienced in the decision to act
entrepreneurially. Therefore, each conceptualization of uncertainty is representative of a construct that is not only reconcilable with its counterpart but also necessary for further theorizing
about entrepreneurial action.
By demonstrating that action is central to
most theories of entrepreneurship, we distill the
various elements of action that must be considered concomitantly when determining whether
one will act entrepreneurially. These include
knowledge (as it relates to the amount of uncertainty perceived), motivation (as it relates to the
willingness to bear uncertainty), and, arguably,
a stimulus. We propose that each of these elements produces a belief that is qualified by un-

133

certainty. This uncertainty takes the form of
doubt, which prevents action by undermining
the prospective actor’s beliefs regarding (1)
whether an environmental stimulus presents an
opportunity for someone in the marketplace, (2)
whether this opportunity could feasibly be enacted by the actor, and (3) whether successful
exploitation of the opportunity would adequately fulfill some personal desire. Drawing on
these elements, we then generate a two-stage
conceptual model of entrepreneurial action that
makes an important distinction between thirdperson opportunity (an opportunity for someone)
and first-person opportunity (an opportunity for
the actor) while explicitly recognizing that both
knowledge and motivation must be considered
concomitantly when examining entrepreneurial
action in each stage.
This article makes a number of contributions
identified by Whetten (1989) as important theoretical insights. First, we use epistemological
evidence from the philosophy and psychology of
action literature to demonstrate that the entrepreneurship literature is characterized by onedimensional conceptualizations of uncertainty’s
preventive role in the entrepreneurial action
process. Second, we offer a conceptual model of
entrepreneurial action that demonstrates how
the addition of a new construct (in some cases
motivation and in others knowledge) significantly alters our understanding of the role that
uncertainty plays in preventing entrepreneurial
action. Third, we use the proposed model to reinterpret theories of the entrepreneur, thereby
enhancing these highly influential economic
models’ predictive validity of entrepreneurial
action at the individual level. Fourth, we use the
model to reveal points of empirical tractability
and philosophical impasse between entrepreneurship theorists employing different ontological assumptions regarding opportunity. Finally, we offer a pragmatic and a conceptual
approach to the difficult task of reconciling contentious philosophical perspectives.
The article proceeds as follows. First, we explore the notions of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial action that highlight the importance
of judgment under uncertainty, and then acknowledge the role of belief and doubt in entrepreneurial judgment using a discussion involving three types of uncertainty: state, effect, and
response. Second, we introduce a number of theories of the entrepreneur and classify them in

<-----Page 2----->134

terms of two streams of research on uncertainty:
one stream emphasizes the role of perceived
uncertainty and the second gives prominence to
the willingness to bear uncertainty. Third, we
offer a conceptual model of entrepreneurial action that reconciles aspects of the two streams of
research that have previously remained independent of each other. We describe our conceptual model of entrepreneurial action as the outcome of the willingness to bear perceived
uncertainty. Fourth, we use our proposed conceptual model of entrepreneurial action to reinterpret three economic theories of the entrepreneur that are considered to be most influential
to the management literature. Finally, we cannot avoid a discussion of the “thorny” issue of
ontology. In this section we discuss a number of
different perspectives about the existence of an
objective opportunity and propose two potential
approaches for reconciling apparently contrasting views.
ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION
AND UNCERTAINTY
Because we are interested in the entrepreneur
as an organizational or economic function that
is filled by an individual, rather than as a personality (i.e., innovative, risk seeking, etc.) or
position (i.e., small business manager, owner,
etc.), we seek definitional foundation in economics, where the entrepreneur traditionally has
been conceptualized in this manner (Casson,
1982: 22). After surveying economic theory devoted to entrepreneurship, Hebert and Link attempt to synthesize several theoretical profiles
by defining the entrepreneur as “someone who
specializes in taking responsibility for and making judgmental decisions that affect the location, the form, and the use of goods, resources or
institutions” (1988: 155). They openly admit their
definition’s similarity to that proposed by Mark
Casson, who defines an entrepreneur as “someone who specializes in taking judgemental decisions about the coordination of scarce resources” (1982: 23). Interestingly, both of these
definitions are reminiscent of the first theory of
the entrepreneur put forth by Richard Cantillon
in 1755, in which he defined the entrepreneur as
“someone who engages in exchanges for profit;
specifically, he or she is someone who exercises
business judgment in the face of uncertainty”
(quoted in Hebert & Link, 1988: 21).

Each of these definitions suggests that the
entrepreneur is an individual who exercises
judgment, which Hastie defines as “the components of the larger decision-making process that
are concerned with assessing, estimating, and
inferring what events will occur and what the
decision-maker’s evaluative reactions to those
outcomes will be” (2001: 657). “Decision making,”
he adds, “refers to the entire process of choosing
a course of action” (2001: 657). Finally, Hastie
suggests that uncertainty refers to “the decisionmaker’s judgments of the propensity for each of
the conditioning events to occur” (2001: 657).
Therefore, judgment is what must be exercised
to make a decision between alternative courses
of action that take place in an uncertain future.
Although many scholars have emphasized the
individual’s exercising of judgment under uncertainty in the form of a decision (e.g., Cantillon, Cole, Keynes, Marshall, Menger, Schultz,
Shackle, etc.), it is important to note that a decision is a necessary but insufficient condition for
the occurrence of entrepreneurship. We return to
the basic realization that entrepreneurship requires one not just to decide but to decide to act.
Therefore, we subscribe to Hebert and Link’s
(1988) position that entrepreneurs respond to and
create change through their entrepreneurial actions, where entrepreneurial action refers to behavior in response to a judgmental decision under uncertainty about a possible opportunity for
profit.1 Whether entrepreneurial action occurs,
however, depends on how much one must rely
on one’s judgment, which, in turn, depends on
the degree of uncertainty experienced in the decision of whether to act.
Alternative conceptualizations of uncertainty
exist within the management, economics, and
psychology literature. Particularly noteworthy is
Milliken’s (1987) exposure of conceptual inconsistencies of the term within the organizational
literature. As a result, he proposes three distinct
types of uncertainty (state, effect, and response)
that appear to be as applicable to the individual

1
This conceptualization of entrepreneurial action is process oriented and transferable across a range of different
definitions of entrepreneurship within the management literature (e.g., Gartner, 1990; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
These scholars identify specific behaviors that are thought
to be especially “entrepreneurial” in nature, such as new
venture creation or Schumpeter’s (1934: 66) five forms of new
combinations.

<-----Page 3----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

as they are to the organization as a unit of analysis. Milliken suggests that state uncertainty is
used to denote when administrators perceive
the environment to be unpredictable (1987: 136).
In contrast, effect uncertainty is defined as “an
inability to predict what the nature of the impact
of a future state of the environment or environmental change will be to the organization” (1987:
137). Finally, Milliken suggests that response uncertainty is “a lack of knowledge of response
options and/or an inability to predict the likely
consequences of a response choice (Conrath,
1967; Duncan, 1972; Taylor, 1984)” (1987: 137), and
he further points out that “response uncertainty
is likely to be salient when there is a perceived
need to act . . . because a pending event or
change is perceived to pose a threat or to provide some unique opportunity to the organization” (1987: 137).
Milliken’s framework implies that uncertainty
in the context of action falls within the exclusive
domain of response uncertainty. However, this
perceived need to act frequently is stimulated
by state or effect uncertainty. This would suggest that, in the context of action, Milliken’s
three types of uncertainty could be simplified
into three questions asked by a prospective actor about his or her relationship to the environment: (1) What’s happening out there? (state uncertainty), (2) How will it impact me? (effect
uncertainty), and (3) What am I going to do about
it? (response uncertainty).
Questions like these require one to form a
belief, defined as a “conviction that certain
things are true” (Neufeldt & Sparks, 1995: 55).
However, this belief is often qualified by a related sense of doubt, which means “to be uncertain or undecided; to tend to disbelieve”
(Neufeldt & Sparks, 1995: 180). This process, in
which a belief and a related sense of doubt are
formed, presupposes the existence of a world
that is malleable and somewhat susceptible to
beneficial actor influence. Therefore, it communicates a world view that is neither fully determined nor fully random (Moya, 1990; Shackle,
1966), and, as a consequence, “uncertainty” can
be viewed as a sense of “doubt” that is inextricable from the beliefs that produce action.
Therefore, because we are interested in the
role that uncertainty plays in preventing people
from acting entrepreneurially, we embrace the
proposition made by Lipshitz and Strauss that
“uncertainty in the context of action is a sense of

135

doubt that blocks or delays action” (1997: 150).
This conceptualization captures three essential
features of uncertainty integral to our argument.
First, the proposition suggests that uncertainty
is subjective in that “different individuals may
experience different doubts in identical situations” (Lipshitz & Strauss, 1997: 150; see also
Duncan, 1972). Lipshitz and Strauss (1997) point
out that the conceptualization of uncertainty as
a subjective experience has a long tradition
within psychology (Duncan, 1972; Smithson,
1989). Entrepreneurship enthusiasts have contributed to this tradition (1) by assuming that
uncertainty prevents action (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990) and (2)
by attributing variation in its action-obstructive
nature to individual differences in needs (McClelland, 1961), values (Weber, 1930), attitudes
toward risk (Khilstrom & Laffont, 1979), confidence (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988), perceptions (Palich & Bagby, 1995), and heuristics
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997).
The second and third features of Lipshitz and
Strauss’s uncertainty proposition are that it is
inclusive in that no particular form of doubt is
specified, such as ignorance of future outcomes
(Conrath, 1967; Smithson, 1989), and that it is
conceptualized in terms of the effect of uncertainty on action—that is, hesitancy, indecisiveness, and procrastination (Dewey, 1933; Goldman, 1986; March, 1981; Yates & Stone, 1992).
These last two features serve to define uncertainty more in terms of what it does than what it
is. This diminishes the importance of determining which of Milliken’s (1987) three forms of environmental uncertainty is technically being
discussed, because each prevents action by contributing to doubt. Likewise, whether conceptualized as risk (MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986),
Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921), ambiguity
(Hogarth, 1987; March & Olsen, 1976), turbulence
(Terreberry, 1968), or equivocality (Weick, 1979),
uncertainty in the context of action acts as a
sense of doubt that (1) produces hesitancy by
interrupting routine action (Dewey, 1933), (2) promotes indecision by perpetuating continued
competition among alternatives (Goldman,
1986), and (3) encourages procrastination by
making prospective options less appealing
(Yates & Stone, 1992).
Entrepreneurship theorists have embraced
the position that uncertainty is detrimental to
entrepreneurial action because properties such

<-----Page 4----->136

Academy of Management Review

as hesitancy, indecisiveness, and procrastination are thought to lead to missed opportunities
(Casson, 1982). The opportunity for action is often conceptualized as fleeting (James, 2002;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), owing to the competitive nature of the market process (Mises,
1949; Schumpeter, 1942). This position is
grounded in an economic assumption that the
procrastination of one actor is typically offset by
the profit-seeking proactiveness of others
(Mann, 1996). Thus, economists often consider it
inevitable that someone in the marketplace will
act, which makes the decision process experienced by any one individual seemingly inconsequential (Stigler, 1963).
Despite economists’ system-level, probabilistic perspective of entrepreneurial action, however, we wish to point out that there is no market
independent of the actors who create it. Therefore, ultimately, someone somewhere must
undergo a decision process in which action is
chosen if any market “process” is to occur. Overlooking this fact has arguably contributed to the
generation of alternative theories of the entrepreneur characterized by examination of only
one dimension of uncertainty’s effect on action.
ALTERNATIVE THEORIES OF
THE ENTREPRENEUR
Traditionally, the label theory of the entrepreneur has been used within the economics literature to denote the study of the relationship
between entrepreneurship and economic activity. These theories (e.g., Kirzner, 1973; Knight,
1921; Schumpeter, 1934) frequently attribute the
movement of the economy to a catalystic function fulfilled by the entrepreneur. Accordingly,
the entrepreneur is conceptualized in terms of
what he or she does—that is, innovates, coordinates, etc. This behavior is then thought to influence the system by moving it toward, or away
from, some ideal state, such as equilibrium or
efficiency.
Two assumptions are characteristic of most
theories of the entrepreneur: (1) entrepreneurship is a “good” thing, with beneficial outcomes
that accrue to the system in which it occurs
(Kilby, 1971; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990),2 and (2)

2
Baumol (1996) questions this assumption by suggesting
that entrepreneurs pursue profit. If this profit is achieved via

January

entrepreneurship is observable as a behavior
that can be attributed to some definitive theoretical attribute capable of differentiating entrepreneur (actor) from nonentrepreneur (nonactor).
Although the first assumption is important for
understanding why scholars have devoted so
much energy to the subject and why the study of
entrepreneurial behavior at the individual level
is of value to organizational studies, it is not the
focal point of this article. The second assumption, however, is highly significant to our argument in that it helps to expose the manner in
which uncertainty is conceptualized within
these theories.
We suggest that many theoretical explanations of why prospective entrepreneurs choose
to pursue a possible opportunity can be classified into two simple conceptualizations of the
role that uncertainty plays in preventing action:
(1) the amount of uncertainty perceived and (2)
the willingness to bear uncertainty. We turn
now to a deeper examination of each.
Entrepreneurial Action As the Outcome of
Less Perceived Uncertainty
While neoclassical economists were abolishing the need to consider individual differences
by constructing theories with assumptions such
as perfect information, “Austrian” economists
were building their economic theories on such
premises as the subjectivity of value (Menger,
1950), imperfect knowledge (Hayek, 1945), asymmetric beliefs (Mises, 1949), and differences in
entrepreneurial alertness (Kirzner, 1973, 1985).
Austrian economists typically have considered
the entrepreneur to be the engine of the economy (Kirzner, 1989; Mises, 1949; Pasour, 1989) and
have attributed the stagnation of the economy to
a lack of entrepreneurial action. This lack of
entrepreneurial action, they believe, is often the
consequence of unperceived opportunities (Kirzner, 1979), which arise from the various explanations mentioned above.
Although Austrians are labeled subjectivists,
this subjectivism traditionally has referred to
the epistemological limitations suffered, to a
greater or lesser extent, by the subjects of their
innovation, then the system benefits as a by-product. However, if innovation is difficult or unnecessary for profit, then
entrepreneurial energy is likely to take unproductive or even
destructive forms.

<-----Page 5----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

theories. Thus, people who have acted entrepreneurially are seen to possess a more accurate
picture of reality than those individuals who
have not acted. Moreover, an objective reality is
thought to exist in which a market opportunity is
there for the taking, but only for those who possess the qualities necessary both to discover
and exploit it (see Addleson, 1995, for an eloquent articulation of this point). Thus, entrepreneurial action is seen as something all would
engage in if they knew what to do, but, owing to
epistemological differences, only some people
(the entrepreneurs) “know” what to do. Accordingly, entrepreneurs are thought to have taken
action because they somehow escaped the ignorance and paralysis produced by uncertainty,
whereas those who have not acted entrepreneurially are believed either to have fallen victim to doubt or to have been blinded to the need
for forming a belief at all.
Graphically, this can be depicted as in Figure
1. This figure shows two hypothetical internal
response curves centered around two means.3
The left mean represents the noisy status quo,
3

The curves centered around the two means are representative of hypothetical responses to the question of
whether the individual believes that a third-person opportunity exists. If the answer is no, then the decision would
reflect a point on the left curve, whereas if the answer is yes,
then the decision would reflect a point on the right curve.
Under a repeated decision scenario, such as those conducted in experimental settings, this process would produce
a response curve around each mean composed of points
representing actual decisions. However, we qualify the
curves as “hypothetical” because, in a natural context, only
one point of an individual’s response curve is observable.

137

and the right mean represents third-person opportunity, which we define as a potential opportunity for someone in the marketplace. Thus,
third-person opportunity may not reflect an opportunity for everyone, but, for those individuals
with the right qualities, market potential exists.
The distance between the means signifies the
ability to discern the market potential of this
third-person opportunity. For example, one
would expect the market potential of a teleporter to be more easily discerned than, say, the
market potential of the internet prior to web
browsers.
The distance between the means and the distribution of the curves contribute to the amount
of uncertainty perceived in the decision to act.
Although the Austrian presumption of an objective reality suggests that the distance between
the means is the same for any prospective actor,
the distribution of the curves surrounding these
means frequently is discussed as a function of a
theoretically determined individual difference.
For example, according to Hayek’s (1945) argument, considerable overlap between the two
curves would represent an individual with little
“local” knowledge of time and place, whereas
little overlap would reflect an individual with a
knowledge base that is highly applicable to the
recognition and exploitation of this particular
third-person opportunity. Thus, the discriminating feature between these two individuals is the
possession of applicable knowledge. This
knowledge reduces perceived uncertainty to a
point that not only enables prospective entrepreneurs to form a belief that they have recog-

FIGURE 1
Hypothetical Internal Response Curves Regarding Third-Person Opportunity

<-----Page 6----->138

Academy of Management Review

nized a third-person opportunity but also allows
them to overcome the belief-related doubt that
would otherwise prevent action.
Therefore, according to many theories of entrepreneurial action, uncertainty has been conceptualized in terms of quantity. Owing to the
distance between the means and the distribution around the means, the prospective entrepreneur is thought to face more or less uncertainty,
which prevents action either by obfuscating the
existence of the third-person opportunity or by
contributing to the doubt people experience in
their belief that a third-person opportunity exists. Thus, the uncertainty perceived by a prospective actor forms a continuum, with complete
ignorance on one end (denoted graphically as
flat response curves) to near certainty on the
other end (denoted graphically as response
curves that nearly form a perfectly straight perpendicular line at the mean, with no overlap
between these narrow curves). Although the role
that perceived uncertainty plays in obstructing
entrepreneurial action is important, we argue
that it is insufficiently explanatory, because it
says nothing about the willingness to bear the
uncertainty that is perceived.
Entrepreneurial Action As the Outcome of
More Willingness to Bear Uncertainty
The theory of the entrepreneur is not the exclusive domain of the Austrian economist. Prominent non-Austrians, from Knight (1921) to
Schumpeter (1934), also have recognized the role
that uncertainty plays in preventing entrepreneurial action. However, these economic theorists conceptualize uncertainty’s action prohibitive role in a slightly different way. They see
entrepreneurial action not as the outcome of
less perceived uncertainty but as more willingness to bear the uncertainty faced by all prospective actors. For instance, Knight addresses
uncertainty explicitly. He posits that profit is the
reward for those willing to bear uncertainty because, unlike risk, uncertainty is inestimable
and therefore uninsurable. Thus, entrepreneurs
are distinguishable from nonentrepreneurs in
their willingness to bear the uncertainty intrinsic to a possibly profitable course of action.
In contrast, the willingness to bear uncertainty is implicit in Schumpeter’s theory, where
he argues that the entrepreneur’s function lies
in the innovative act of creating new combina-

January

tions. Believing that the potential for new combinations is abundant and at times obvious,
Schumpeter delineates entrepreneurs from nonentrepreneurs not by differences in knowledge
or perception but by the performance of the innovative act itself (1934: 88). This elimination of
perceptual differences forces Schumpeter to
speculate reluctantly about motivational differences in an attempt to explain why some individuals and not others engage in entrepreneurial action (1934: 90).
Schumpeter’s (1934) behavioral bent attracted
psychologists, such as McClelland (1961), Hagen
(1962), and Kunkel (1965), who exchanged the
economic theorists’ descriptive orientation for a
more prescriptive theoretical viewpoint. Whereas economic theories of the entrepreneur focused on explaining what must occur (e.g., uncertainty bearing) for the economy to function,
psychological theories sought to explain why
entrepreneurs are more willing than their counterparts to bear this uncertainty. Because these
psychologists shared the economists’ belief that
entrepreneurship produced economic growth,
they tried to identify the motives underlying entrepreneurial activity in an effort to develop
these motives in their subjects. Unfortunately,
this was thought to produce explanations that
relied too heavily on unchangeable needs and
values developed in childhood.4
Graphically, this can be depicted as in Figure
2. Figure 2 builds on the graph shown in Figure
1. However, in this case, the distance between
the means and the distribution of the curves
remain constant. The vertical line in Figure 2
indicates the criterion, used to designate the
point at which the prospective entrepreneur is
willing to act. It is at this point that the prospective entrepreneur decides that a possible thirdperson opportunity is an opportunity for him or
her—that is, a first-person opportunity. The criterion, therefore, conveys the individual’s willingness to bear the uncertainty intrinsic to entrepreneurial action.
A criterion that splits the uncertainty (denoted
by the area of the overlapping response curves)

4
It should be noted that, unlike critics, these theorists did
not see these motives as unchangeable elements of personality. For instance, much of McClelland’s empirical work
was devoted to establishing that the need for achievement
could be learned. We wish to thank Jerry Katz for this insightful observation.

FIGURE 2
The Criterion As the Individual’s Willingness to Bear Uncertainty Intrinsic
to Entrepreneurial Action

in half means that a prospective actor will be as
likely to act as not. In contrast, if an individual
chooses a lax criterion (denoted by moving the
criterion to the left), he or she will pursue almost
every possibility that comes along. Such a location of the criterion is representative of the profile of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur who is
frequently conceptualized as an innovator,
leader, and/or adventurer. It is also reflective of
the Knightian entrepreneur who is explicitly
conceptualized as a “bearer of uncertainty.” Psychologists like McClelland sought to explain the
“laxity” of the criterion (e.g., as the need for
achievement) and promote it in an effort to encourage entrepreneurial activity.
If the individual chooses a strict criterion (denoted by moving the criterion to the right), he or
she will choose to pursue very few possibilities.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the decision,
there is always overlap between the noise and
third-person opportunity curves. Thus, individuals are forced to expose themselves to the possibility of either committing an error of commission (taking action only to find their belief was
unfounded) or committing an error of omission
(not taking action only to regret it when time
proves that their passed-over hunch was correct). Although only time proves prophecy, consideration of the possible payoffs associated
with these various decisional outcomes shapes
prospective actors’ decisions as they contemplate whether to commit to a particular course of
action.
A simple amalgamation of the above arguments suggests that uncertainty prevents action
by obfuscating (1) the need or possibility for

action, (2) the knowledge of what to do,5 and (3)
whether the potential reward of action is worth
the potential cost. In the next section we present
a conceptual model (illustrated in Figure 3) that
relates perceived uncertainty and motivation to
entrepreneurial action.
A PROPOSED SYNTHESIS: ENTREPRENEURIAL
ACTION AS THE OUTCOME OF THE
WILLINGNESS TO BEAR PERCEIVED
UNCERTAINTY
Environmental change is usually thought to
be a source of business opportunities. For example, Shane (2000) investigated a technological
change in printing (a patented three-dimensional printing process) and eight teams of entrepreneurs, each of whom pursued a different
opportunity arising from the technology. Similarly, we use technological change as a starting
point to summarize our conceptualization of the
two stages of entrepreneurial action.
Stage I: Attention and Third-Person
Opportunity
Stage I addresses first-person attention. Either
people acknowledge a third-person opportunity
arising from a technological change or they do
not. Of course, those individuals who are unaware of the technological change are likely to

We use “what to do” inclusively. That is, “what to do”
does not refer merely to the “end” but also to the “means” of
“how,” “when,” and “where” that end is to be achieved.

A Conceptual Model Relating Perceived Uncertainty and Motivation to Entrepreneurial Action

fall into the latter category. For example, without a certain degree of domain-specific knowledge, one may not even recognize the possibility
for action (by oneself or others). In other words,
there may be so much uncertainty that the individual is too ignorant to ask, “What’s happening
out there?” Thus, whether individuals perceive
Milliken’s state and effect uncertainty depends
on whether they know enough about a technological change to perceive it, even if only faintly.
This suggests that a general form of domainspecific knowledge is necessary to trigger the
experiencing of response uncertainty.
However, knowledge need not predicate motivation in this process. Before the criterion becomes attached to the evaluation of a particular
third-person opportunity, its location depends
on an individual’s strategy. “A strategy refers to
a pattern of decisions in the acquisition, retention, and utilization of information that serves to
meet certain objectives, i.e., to insure certain
forms of outcome and to insure against certain
others” (Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin, 1956: 54).
Thus, the position of the criterion prior to the
existence of a stimulus represents the individual’s strategy.
For example, when a person becomes dissatisfied with his or her current athletic shoes, the
individual may begin to consider switching

brands when buying a new pair. As a consequence, the individual will likely become more
sensitive to what others are wearing than before
and will increasingly allocate attention to the
issue. This relaxes the criterion, making the individual more sensitive to his or her environment. This can produce deliberate search, such
as exploring various stores in the hopes of finding the qualities the person is looking for in an
athletic shoe (e.g., improved performance and
comfort, through reduction of the accumulation
of sweat in the shoe), or it can take form as a
discovery heuristic (Gigerenzer, 1991), such as a
sudden increase in awareness of ventilation
technology used in other products (e.g., bellows,
fans, suction devices) that one (and others) had
previously ignored. Either way, the desire for a
new, improved athletic shoe has spurred the
acquisition of knowledge likely to prompt the
recognition of recent technological advances in
fan miniaturization (for use in computers) and
the determination that to insert miniaturized
fans in athletic shoes represents a third-person
opportunity, one that reduces the temperature of
the foot and thus reduces sweating, odor, and
such fungal infections as athlete’s foot. Once
that opportunity is noticed, however, the criterion becomes attached to the specific action nec-

<-----Page 9----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

essary to assess whether third-person opportunity represents first-person opportunity.
Therefore, the acknowledgment of a thirdperson opportunity arising from a technological
change is configural in the sense that people
who have the necessary knowledge and motivation will believe that there is third-person opportunity arising from a technological change, but
those who do not have the necessary knowledge
and motivation will not believe that the technological change represents an opportunity for
someone and will no longer attend to it. Stage II
applies only to those individuals who believe
that a third-person opportunity exists.
Stage II: Evaluation and First-Person
Opportunity
Stage II addresses first-person evaluation.
The belief that a technological change represents a third-person opportunity triggers a decision-making process in which the prospective
entrepreneur must evaluate whether this thirdperson opportunity constitutes a first-person opportunity. The individual forms beliefs regarding what to do and why to do it—that is, whether
the potential reward for this particular action is
worth the potential cost specific to oneself. However, both of these beliefs are undermined to a
greater or lesser extent by doubt. Therefore, regardless of whether the construct of knowledge
or motivation is discussed, the process remains
the same: a belief is formed regarding a desired
end state, but doubt exists regarding whether
that desired end state is feasible (can be
achieved in the manner envisioned) and desirable (whether its attainment will fulfill the motive for which it is being sought).6
This evaluation stage is rooted in Aristotle’s
“practical syllogism,” which forms the foundation of most expectancy-value theories (e.g.,
Ajzen, 1996a,b; Gatewood, Shaver, Powers, &
Gartner, 2002). According to Aristotle (1987), the
premises of this syllogism are the actor’s desires
(“A wants to achieve X”) and beliefs (“A believes
that if B is performed X will occur”), and the
conclusion is not another belief but the action
itself. Thus, the realization that individual ac-

the terms effectiveness and efficiency are used, respectively,
to delineate goal attainment from motive satisfaction.

141

tion is not solely a function of knowledge or
motivation but, rather, a composite of belief and
desire regarding a particular form of behavior is
not new, nor is it limited to expectancy-value
theory (Greve, 2001). In fact, Hastie suggests that
the field of judgment and decision making is
about “how people . . . combine desires (utilities,
personal values, goals, ends, etc.) and beliefs
(expectations, knowledge, means, etc.) to choose
a course of action” (2001: 655– 656). He goes on to
point out that the conceptual and perhaps defining template for a decision comprises three components:
(a) courses of action (choice, options, and alternatives); (b) beliefs about objective states, processes, and events in the world (including outcome states and means to achieve them); and (c)
desires, values, or utilities that describe the consequences associated with the outcomes of each
action-event combination (2001: 656).

Believing that one has recognized a thirdperson opportunity does not necessarily mean
one believes one possesses the knowledge and
motivation necessary to exploit it. However,
through learning efforts and/or the encouragement of others, one may be able to overcome
doubt and act. Therefore, the question of the
second stage is similar to a classic “risk/return”
dilemma in which a prospective actor must ask
him/herself whether he or she believes that the
payoff of the third-person opportunity justifies
bearing the perceived uncertainty necessary to
attain it. If the answer is yes, then a first-person
opportunity is believed to exist, and entrepreneurial action takes place. The “risk” of this
risk/return dilemma, however, is subjectively
determined by the prospective actor. Thus, it
seems that, to act entrepreneurially, people
need not have a high tolerance for uncertainty if
they believe that they know what they are doing.
Therefore, whether one will engage in a particular action is a decision that depends on
whether the individual is motivated enough to
act, given the uncertainty he or she expects to
encounter in pursuit of a third-person opportunity. The next section applies our model to a
number of influential economic theories of the
entrepreneur (conveyed in Table 1) not only as a
means of revealing problems that management
scholars face when trying to apply these theories of the entrepreneur to the individual rather
than system level, but also as a means of glean-

REINTERPRETATION OF INFLUENTIAL
THEORIES OF THE ENTREPRENEUR
Failure to address entrepreneurial action in
terms of both knowledge and motivation has
produced a number of theories of the entrepreneur that are incomplete when used at the individual level of analysis. In this section we use
our conceptual model of entrepreneurial action
to address possible limitations of the three theories of the entrepreneur that are considered
most influential in the management literature:
Schumpeter (1934), Kirzner (1973), and Knight
(1921).7
Schumpeter’s Innovator: Epistemological and
Ontological Issues
Schumpeter’s theory introduces two major assumptions. The first is that perceived uncertainty does not play a role in entrepreneurial
7
We have chosen to emphasize these three theorists over
others for the following reasons. First, as Stevenson and Jarillo
(1990) point out, Schumpeter’s conceptualization of the entrepreneur has provided one of the primary theoretical foundations on which entrepreneurial management research has
been built. Second, Kirzner’s conceptualization of the entrepreneur is the most influential in the opportunity paradigm proposed by Shane and Venkataraman (2000) in their recent but
already highly influential piece. Finally, Knight was chosen to
round off our examples because his theory is typically recognized as the third primary and distinctly original theory of the
entrepreneur (Barreto, 1989; Hebert & Link, 1988).

action. This assumption is derived from a belief
that opportunity is abundant and readily identifiable. For example, Schumpeter discusses the
economy as if it were a relatively closed system
that merely interfaces with science, literature,
politics, and so forth via the entrepreneur.8 In
doing so, Schumpeter suggests that opportunities originate elsewhere for all prospective entrepreneurs to see. Because all of the prospective entrepreneurs are equally capable of
seeing the development, it is only the adventurous who make the leap—that is, entrepreneurs
can be discriminated from others only in terms
of the location of their criterion. Schumpeter is
then forced to speculate about individual differences in the motivation to act entrepreneurially,
and he identifies a number of “traits,” including
greater self-centeredness (1934: 91–92), “the
dream and the will to found a private kingdom”

8

For example, Schumpeter notes:
It is no part of [the entrepreneur’s] function to “find” or
to “create” new possibilities. These are always
present, abundantly accumulated by all sorts of people. Often they are also generally known and being
discussed by scientific or literary writers. In other
cases, there is nothing to discover about them, because they are quite obvious. To take an example from
political life, it was not at all difficult to see how the
social and political conditions of France at the time of
Louis XVI could have been improved so as to avoid a
breakdown of the ancient regime. Plenty of people as
a matter of fact did see it. But nobody was in a position
to do it. Now, it is this “doing the thing,” without which
possibilities are dead, of which the [entrepreneur’s]
function consists (1934: 88).

<-----Page 11----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

(1934: 93), “the will to conquer” (1934: 93), and the
“joy of creating” (1934: 93–94).
Schumpeter’s second major assumption is
that opportunities have an objective existence—
an argument that communicates a social realist
ontology. Ontological assumptions are assumptions concerning the nature of social reality. “[A]
social realist ontology presumes that actors are
real—natural persons having innate capacities
to act so as to secure and protect their interests.
. . . The environment too is regarded as real: it is
out there as a part of the natural world” (Scott,
1995: 50). In contrast, a social constructionist ontology suggests that “individuals do not discover the world and its ways, but collectively
invent them. Such invention is not random and
arbitrary, but itself arises out of and is informed
and constrained by existing social arrangements and beliefs” (Scott, 1995: 50). Because
Schumpeter’s theory conceptualizes possibilities as existing objectively (i.e., in the form of
new technologies observable by all), it not only
recognizes the existence of a third-person opportunity but it also equates this third-person opportunity with first-person opportunity in every
way except one: the amount of desire people
exhibit in deciding whether to exploit it.
Subscription to this social realist ontology, in
combination with the elimination of epistemological differences, puts Schumpeter into a bit of
a straitjacket. Because everyone in his economy
shares the same perceptual acumen, opportunities must be new to everyone, not merely the
actor, or else they would already have been
exploited. This limits Schumpeter’s “true” entrepreneur to the domain of radical innovation.9
However, the radicalness of the innovation and
even the innovation itself become third-party
assessments subject to post hoc analysis. That
is, the degree of innovativeness exhibited is
more dependent on a subjective evaluation
made by a number of observers after the fact
than it is on some objectively definable criteria.
Consequently, a priori classification of “radical

9
We use the adjective true because although Schumpeter
often used the term entrepreneur to refer to both the pioneer
and the subsequent entrants, he considered the pioneer, or
“leader,” to represent the “true” theoretical entrepreneur
responsible for stimulating the system. To avoid the confusion associated with introducing a new term, we thought it
best to designate this theoretical profile as the “true” entrepreneur rather than the “leader.”

143

innovation” is exceptionally difficult and empirically problematic.
One potential explanation for this difficulty is
that action is an individual phenomenon affecting system-level outcomes. Traditionally, theoretical focus has started with the system-level
outcome (i.e. radical innovation), and the theorist then looked to the actor(s) to determine the
cause. This approach unwittingly imposes the
ontological assumptions common to economic,
system-level theories on to the process experienced by the individual actor (i.e., entrepreneur).
Unlike these system-level theories, which rely
on an observer’s assessment of whether an actor
is engaging in radical innovation or bearing
uncertainty, a theory of individual action frequently defines novelty through the eyes of the
actor (see Weber 1947, 1968) and argues that it is
this actor’s assessment of the situation that ultimately determines whether entrepreneurial
action will occur. Thus, the individual action
that impacts the system depends on whether an
activity is radical, uncertain, novel, and so forth
in the mind of the prospective actor. If this action
occurs on a scientific knowledge frontier, then it
will likely appear radical to observers, but if this
action occurs on a personal knowledge frontier
(e.g., franchising), then it may appear to observers to be nothing more than imitation. To the
particular actor, however, it may be novel either
way. An embrace of this first-person approach is
characteristic of the Austrian school and of Kirzner’s theory, to which we now turn our attention.
Kirzner’s Alert Arbitrageur: Motivational and
Configural Issues
Whereas Schumpeter’s entrepreneur disrupts
equilibrium by introducing radical innovation,
Kirzner’s entrepreneur begins in disequilibrium
and fulfills the function of an arbitrageur who
moves the economy toward equilibrium by rectifying discrepancies in supply and demand.10
Unlike Schumpeter, Kirzner (1973) provides ample attention to epistemological differences under the guise of entrepreneurial alertness. However, within Kirzner’s (1979) work, there is an

These discrepancies in supply and demand are not
limited to existing products and services. They also include
future discrepancies that can arise from discoveries of superior means-end frameworks of which people were previously unaware.

unwitting dilution of his concept of entrepreneurial alertness from a description of a behavior that is necessary for the economy to function
properly11 to a description of a psychological
characteristic common to successful entrepreneurs.12 We say “unwitting” because Kirzner frequently acknowledges the importance of a
statement made by his mentor, Ludwig von
Mises: “The economist must never be a specialist. In dealing with any problem he must fix his
glance upon the whole system” (Mises, 1949: 69).
As a behavior that is necessary for the economy to function properly, entrepreneurial alertness is what happens when the market presents
a profitable situation that is successfully exploited by an individual who “fits” the necessary profile (Kirzner, 1973, 1980). In essence, entrepreneurial alertness is a less mathematical
exposition of probability theory in which the
market presents an objective opportunity for
someone possessing the necessary knowledge.
Entrepreneurial alertness ensures exploitation
of this opportunity and consequently perpetuates the market system.
To use an analogy, entrepreneurial alertness
is like a radio trivia contest. Although you or I
may not know the answer to the trivia question
asked by the disc jockey, someone inevitably
11

For example, Kirzner notes:
This entrepreneurial alertness is crucial to the market process. Disequilibrium represents a situation
of widespread market ignorance. This ignorance is
responsible for the emergence of profitable opportunities. Entrepreneurial alertness exploits these
opportunities when others pass them by. G.L.S.
Shackle and Lachman emphasized the unpredictability of human knowledge, and, indeed, we do not
clearly understand how entrepreneurs get their
flashes of superior foresight. We cannot explain
how some men discover what is around the corner
before others do. . . . As an empirical matter, however, opportunities do tend to be perceived and
exploited. And it is on this observed tendency that
our belief in a determinate market process is
founded (1979: 9).

12
For example, within the same book providing the previous comment, Kirzner states:

The truth is that the ability to learn without deliberate search is a gift individuals enjoy in quite
different degrees. It is this gift surely, that we have
in mind when we talk of entrepreneurial alertness.
Entrepreneurial alertness consists, after all, in the
ability to notice without search opportunities that
have been hitherto overlooked (1979: 148).

does. Therefore, an objective opportunity can be
said to exist. The first individual who knows the
answer and calls in to claim the prize is the
exhibitor of Kirzner’s (1973) concept of entrepreneurial alertness. Accordingly, entrepreneurial
alertness has no meaning a priori. By definition,
it can only be said to exist post hoc. Therefore,
alertness can only be said to exist for the successful radio caller (and possibly to a lesser
degree for those who know the answer, try to
call, but are not as fast as the winner). The caller
who gets through but provides the wrong answer cannot be described as exercising entrepreneurial alertness. Thus, entrepreneurial
alertness is a configural concept in which an
objective market opportunity is only an opportunity for those possessing the necessary attributes. Therefore, because this alertness is a
product of the market, it is problematic for it to
be discussed as a universal attribute of entrepreneurial individuals independent of the system in which they operate.
However, entrepreneurial alertness is used as
a description of a psychological characteristic
common to successful entrepreneurs in Kirzner’s
later works (1982, 1997, 1999; Kirzner & Institute of
Economic Affairs, 1997) as an effort to soften
(1982: 156 –157) the more deterministic stances
taken in his earlier work (e.g., 1979: 9). In doing
so, he obfuscates the configural nature of the
“alertness” concept by discussing it more in
terms of a quality observable in characteristics
such as prescience, boldness, self-confidence,
creativity, and innovative ability (Kirzner, 1999).
This transforms entrepreneurial alertness into
nothing more than judgment and leads the
reader to believe that the concept is separable
from the market context. However, we argue that
it is not. This judgment is still discussed in terms
of how well the entrepreneur’s envisaged future
corresponds to the realized future (Kirzner, 1982:
156).
The problem that this introduces lies in the
fact that Kirzner equates opportunity recognition with entrepreneurial action (e.g., “entrepreneurial alertness exploits these opportunities
when others pass them by”—see footnote 11). In
a subsequent article in which he compares and
contrasts his entrepreneur with Schumpeter’s,
Kirzner (1999) comes closer to recognizing the
need for a criterion. However, he still tries to
address motivation in terms of perception (i.e.,
the proposed solution is still the need for a

<-----Page 13----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

tighter distribution around the mean of the
third-person opportunity). Kirzner explicates:
The seer who can imagine how the world might
be improved by a radical innovation but who
lacks the needed boldness and initiative (to
shoulder the risks which he would have to assume in order actually to introduce this innovation to reality in a world fraught with uncertainties)— has in fact not yet really discovered an
available, attractive opportunity for innovation. If
he has not seen that opportunity in so shining a
light that it drives him to its implementation in
spite of the jeering skepticism of others, and in
spite of the possibility of its ultimate failure—
then he has not really “seen” that opportunity
(1999 13).

In essence, Kirzner’s argumentation collapses
the attention and the evaluation stages of our
conceptual model of entrepreneurial action into
one simultaneous occurrence in which individuals become entrepreneurs if and only if their
prior knowledge enables them to go from ignorance to near certainty instantaneously. That is,
an individual becomes an entrepreneur when
his or her distribution around the third-person
opportunity mean is so tight that uncertainty is,
for all material purposes, eliminated from the
question of whether to act (as was the case in
the aforementioned radio contest analogy). The
primary problem with this conception lies in the
realization that you or I may frequently know the
answer to a radio trivia question without believing that the prize is motivating enough to waste
time on the unlikely prospect of getting through
to the station. Therefore, without motivation, entrepreneurial alertness cannot be expected to
produce entrepreneurial action, regardless of
how “clearly” one may have “seen” an opportunity.
For the most part, Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurial alertness is an elegant explanation of
the attention stage. Ignorance is addressed in
terms of perception, and the ability to notice
opportunities without search is highly reminiscent of personal strategy. However, to be a theory of the entrepreneur, both the attention and
the evaluation stages are necessary. After all,
entrepreneurial perception can only be considered “entrepreneurial” when it produces action.
This cannot be achieved without evaluating
action-specific uncertainty (even if only briefly,
owing to a potentially nominal amount of uncertainty). This evaluation, in turn, involves the
necessary motivation in relation to one’s belief

145

and corresponding doubt that one knows what
to do. Therefore, according to Kirzner, being an
entrepreneur logically implies that entrepreneurial alertness has been exercised. Without
entrepreneurial alertness, the individual would
not have perceived and acted on the opportunity, and would not, therefore, be an entrepreneur.
Knight’s Uncertainty Bearer: Attention Issues
Because it emphasizes uncertainty in the explanation of profit, Knight’s (1921) theory comes
the closest of the three in recognizing the significance of both knowledge and motivation in entrepreneurial action. However, because the context of the theory is an existing firm, the
existence of a decision scenario is frequently
taken for granted, and little explanation is given
to how the decision maker escapes ignorance.
Knight argues that individuals frequently face
uncertainty in the decisions they make regarding the normal functioning of the enterprise—
that is, forecasting consumer demand, projecting costs, and so on. Thus, recognizing or
creating opportunities is made insignificant, because profit is believed to come from uncertainty, which Knight considers to be rarely in
short supply. Instead, he places emphasis on the
responsibility associated with decision making.
Accordingly, Knight’s theory discusses entrepreneurial action solely in terms of the evaluation stage, without adequate concern for the attention stage. In other words, there is no need to
address the kind of radical uncertainty (i.e., flat
response curves) indicative of market ignorance
if one begins with the assumption that the stimulus will be thrust on the individual in the normal course of business activities. This position
makes Knight’s theory congenial to discussions
of scanning and deliberate search common to
strategy research (Dutton & Jackson, 1987, 1997)
but incomplete when addressing discussions of
discovery, which are more commonly associated
with entrepreneurship. Because scanning and
deliberate search are prompted by a conscious
awareness of a need for more information, they
address uncertainty and known ignorance (i.e.,
“I know what it is that I don’t know”). Discovery,
however, is based on notions of complete ignorance (i.e., “I don’t know what it is that I don’t
know”). That is, the individual is not consciously
investigating the phenomenon and may even be

<-----Page 14----->146

Academy of Management Review

involved in alternative activities that engage
his or her attention, thereby preventing recognition of a third-person opportunity.
Although in some respects Knight’s theory offers a less comprehensive explanation of why
the economy functions effectively and why firms
emerge than either Schumpeter’s or Kirzner’s, in
other ways Knight may have an advantage over
Schumpeter and Kirzner. By not discussing the
economy explicitly, Knight is able to focus more
clearly on the individual’s decision-making process. This focus on the individual and relative
neglect of the system may be responsible not
only for preventing oversight of either knowledge or motivation but also for keeping Knight
from becoming too enslaved by his ontological
assumptions. Although Knight clearly exhibits
social realist sympathies when he suggests that
“a man’s judgment has, in an effective sense, a
true or objective value” (1921: 270 –271 footnote),
his theory is not constrained by them, as is the
case with Schumpeter and Kirzner, each of
whom focuses substantially on the concept of
equilibrium and disequilibrium.
As a result, Knight’s theory is less configural
in nature. In fact, the third-person opportunity
could be conceptualized in terms of a socially
constructed situation in the future about which
the entrepreneur must try to accurately predict
what will take place. For example, the question
is not whether this is or is not an objective opportunity to seize; rather, it is “How firmly do I
believe that I can sell a certain number of my
new product to the market?” In such a scenario,
the expectation becomes the third-person opportunity and the actor’s knowledge and motivation
contribute to whether the actor deems the scenario action worthy (i.e., “Can I make the future
what I want it to be?”). This kind of scenario
generation and enactment escapes the heavy
determinism implied by the equilibrium paradigm and begins to look a lot like the psychological stances taken by radical, subjectivist
economists (e.g., Ebeling, 1986; Maki, 2001;
Shackle, 1972) and critical psychologists, such
as Weick (1979, 1995). This change in argumentation, however, results in a shift in one’s ontological assumptions.
Schumpeter and Kirzner embrace social realism. In both theories discovery plays a role. Because Kirzner begins with a dynamic and inclusive economy, he must address discovery
directly, which he does through his concept of

January

market ignorance. Schumpeter also addresses
discovery, but more indirectly. He simply pushes
it back into the realm of science, making the
scientists the inventors and the entrepreneurs
merely innovators. However, the fact remains
that “discovery” still occurs somewhere in his
world view.
In contrast, action theorists of a sociological
(DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977)
and critical psychological bent (Burke & Reitzes,
1991; Weick, 1993) favor a social constructionist
orientation (Scott, 1995), shying away from terms
such as discovery when discussing social contexts (Scott, 1995). These theorists do not see the
social environment as something to be discovered; instead, they view it as either “wider belief
systems and cultural frames [that] are imposed
on or adopted by individual actors and organizations” (Scott, 1995: 44) or as “understandings
and scripts [that] emerge out of actions as well
as guide them” (Scott, 1995: 45), respectively.
This subtle but powerful shift of ontology from
social realism to social constructionism presents possibilities and problems for entrepreneurship research.
IMPLICATIONS OF AN ACTION FRAMEWORK
It is not our purpose in this article to act as
proponents or critics of social realism or social
constructionism. Rather, we merely wish to illustrate that the many economic theories of the
entrepreneur that are so influential to management theory today are, at their core, theories of
action that are laden with ontological assumptions. These assumptions influence not only
which components of action are discussed but
also the way that opportunity is conceptualized.
Recognition of this fact enables scholars to draw
from these theories in a more productive manner, both theoretically and empirically.
We propose that an action framework can
lead to more productive discussions regarding
the important entrepreneurial concept of opportunity (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund, 2001;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stevenson &
Gumpert, 1985). Shane and Venkataraman (2000)
draw from economic theory and present an eloquent argument for the objective existence of
opportunities. In a highly original study, Shane
(2000) pushes this paradigm to the empirical
front by establishing the mediating role that
prior knowledge has in both the discovery and

<-----Page 15----->2006

McMullen and Shepherd

exploitation of opportunity. Perhaps what is
most interesting about this study, in relation to
our argument, is that the same term opportunity
is used to denote both the third-person opportunity of the new technology and the first-person
opportunity of the various individuals who perceive it in different ways. For example, Shane
states, “Potential entrepreneurs should look to
discover opportunities in what they know rather
than in what is popular with other entrepreneurs” (2000: 467). Language such as this conveys a belief in the objectivity of third-person
opportunity, even if epistemological differences
produce different interpretations of it.13
Other entrepreneurship scholars who have
exhibited a qualified subscription to this paradigm have provocatively proposed the use of
signal detection theory (MacMillan & Creelman,
1991; McFall & Treat, 1999; Swets, 1996) for examining opportunity recognition and evaluation
(e.g., Baron, 2002; McMullen & Shepherd, 2003).
However, the question of whether an error of
commission is attributable to entrepreneurial
error in terms of misperceived opportunity, poor
strategy formulation, poor strategy implementation, or unfavorable changes in environmental
conditions becomes, at best, difficult to determine using this ontological foundation.
In stark contrast to these social realists are
action enthusiasts who exhibit social constructionist sympathies. For example, Gartner,
Carter, and Hills (2001) argue that opportunities
are often enacted phenomena with no existence
independent of the individuals who envision
and/or exploit them. For these scholars, discussion of third-person opportunity undermines
their world view. They fear that the language
that accompanies this realist ontology reflects
an artificially constructed framework superimposed on the phenomenon by scholars to help
them make sense of it. They suggest that the
consequence of such a framework is that it obfuscates scholarly understanding of the phenomenon as it actually occurs. For example, by
using words in surveys such as “discovery,”
which they argue are not used by people when
confronting the phenomenon in a natural state,
13

This suggests that Shane subscribes to a social realist
ontology, but it is a “critical realism,” in which there are
limits on individuals’ epistemological abilities, versus a
“naive realism,” in which no such limitations exist (Lincoln
& Guba, 2000).

147

scholars distort findings by introducing their
own conceptions of the phenomenon to be explained. Although the debate regarding which
ontology is more suited to entrepreneurship research is integral to “good” science (Cannella &
Paetzold, 1994), it remains diluted as a discussion of the nature of opportunity and unrecognized for what it is—a philosophical debate
about the nature of the social world and human
action (Burrell & Morgan, 1979).
Therefore, the primary difference between entrepreneurship scholars with social realist sympathies and those with social constructionist
sympathies concerns the nature of third-person
opportunity. Is an “opportunity” conceived to be
“out there” awaiting discovery, evaluation, and
exploitation? Or does one begin with an individual’s knowledge and motivation and attempt to
determine how that influences his or her mental
representation of the environment? We propose
two potential approaches for reconciling these
contrasting views: one pragmatic and the other
conceptual.
A Pragmatic Approach
Perhaps the easiest way to address the philosophical nature of third-person opportunity is to
avoid it. Arguably, this is precisely what many
positivist psychologists, such as Simon, Tversky
and Kahneman, and Giegerenzer, have done.
Using experimental methods or controlled tasks,
the researcher is able to observe individual behavior within an “objective,” somewhat microcosmic reality. For example, both Simon’s work
using the game of chess or Tversky and Kahneman’s framing experiments examine judgment
and decision making regarding an “objective”
answer (i.e., one that is logically right or wrong).
Historically, the quality of the individual’s decision has been determined by equating “good”
judgment with “rational” judgment as determined by statistics, or probability theory
(Hastie, 2001). Accordingly, these tasks are not
subject to multiple interpretations.
This same approach can be used to analyze
the decision of whether to engage in entrepreneurial action. Because one can control within
an experiment the amount of information presented to the individual, the researcher can control the distance between the noise and thirdperson opportunity means in such a way as to
ensure substantial distance or close proximity.

Thus, regardless of whether an “opportunity” in
the real world ever objectively exists, one can
create an experiment in which an opportunistic
situation does undoubtedly exist (i.e., the potential for arbitrage).
However, such an experiment suffers from
some of the critiques leveraged against Knight’s
theory above (i.e., a decision scenario is forced
on the decision maker, leaving the researcher
uninformed about the allocation of entrepreneurial attention). In addition, whether a situation can be classified as an opportunity if an
individual recognizes it and deems it unworthy
of exploitation, and whether an arbitrage opportunity is an “entrepreneurial” opportunity, are
questions that require theoretical answers that
would most likely go unaddressed under this
approach.
One final observation regarding this solution
is that it is not so much behavioral as it is
cognitive or decisional in nature. Sarasvathy’s
(2001a,b) work on effectuation within a slightly
more natural setting epitomizes the promising
potential of this method. By using “think-aloud”
protocols to examine how entrepreneurs think
about opportunity, she successfully sidesteps
the configural issues that are often embedded in
economic theories of the entrepreneur. In fact,
the importance of ontological assumptions is
effectively eliminated by focusing only on perceived behavioral control and not the actual behavioral control associated with subsequent action. This obviates the need to worry about
whether it was the opportunity, the execution, or
the environment that prevented successful entrepreneurial action. This approach works well
if one is interested in the cognitive elements of
opportunity, which is Sarasvathy’s objective.
However, its extension to action explanation requires one to determine whether the findings on
how entrepreneurs think they would go about
acting entrepreneurially correspond to how they
actually behave under natural circumstances.14

In the more problematic context of a natural setting,
scholars have investigated the role of knowledge in entrepreneurship by using measures of general and specific human capital. General human capital typically is operationalized by years of schooling (Rauch & Frese, 2000; see, for
example, Bates, 1995; Evans & Leighton, 1989; and Davidsson
& Honig, 2003). In the entrepreneurship literature, the most
frequently investigated aspect of specific human capital is
previous start-up experience (Bates, 1995; Cooper, Folta, &

January

A Conceptual Approach
Given these various observations, we propose
a conditional compromise that is consistent with
an action framework and that includes economic theories of the entrepreneur but is not
exclusive to their ontological assumptions. We
argue that the willingness to bear the perceived
uncertainty associated with an entrepreneurial
act is representative of a belief-desire configuration, in which belief of what to do is a function
of knowledge and desire of why to do it is a
function of motivation. This conceptualization is
identical to an intention as described in the context of action theory. For instance, Greve notes:
Actions are distinguished from other kinds of human behavior by the way people usually explain
how they came about: They have reasons for actions. This means that individuals do what they
do because they desire (want) to reach a goal and
believe (expect) that the action is an appropriate
or necessary means of reaching it. The beliefs
and desires “rationalize” the action (Davidson,
1980a) (Greve, 2001: 437).
Given a specific action, the presence of a specific
intention (belief-desire configuration) cannot be
doubted. When an observed behavior is in fact
the expression of a certain action, then a corresponding intention (constellation of desires and
beliefs) is necessarily implied; the hypothesis
that this action expresses these particular desires and beliefs cannot be disproven by empirical means. The assertion that a person, when he
or she performs an action, does so due to certain
beliefs (expectations) and desires (values) is trivially true, because whatever he or she performs
would not, in any other case, be an action (Greve,
2001: 439).

Greve suggests that action, by definition, is
intentional behavior. Therefore, one cannot start
with the behavioral portion of the action and
argue that increases in the intention caused the
action. This would be tautological, given that
the action partially consists of the intention.
However, one could avoid tautology by starting
with the strength of the intention and predicting
whether the intended behavior subsequently
ensues. Such an approach to entrepreneurial action would equate the concept of opportunity
with that of intention. This action approach (in
which the researcher examines the composition
of the prospective entrepreneur’s intention as it

Woo, 1995; Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Wright, Robbie, & Ennew, 1997).

<-----Page 17----->2006

forms and then determines whether subsequent
behavior occurs15) avoids the tautology inherent
in some entrepreneurial studies, the erroneous
ascriptions of risk tolerance or superior innovative abilities made by observers, and the post
hoc rationalization common to retrospection
bias.
In addition, paradigm wars regarding ontological assumptions become less important because, regardless of whether social environments are objective or subjective phenomena,
the impact they have on individuals’ intentions
are real just the same. Therefore, it seems that
the ontological concerns discussed in this article only come to the forefront when one is interested in what accounts for the origination of the
intention or the quality of the outcome produced
by the entrepreneurial action. Thus, it appears
that although the study of entrepreneurial action consists of an empirically tractable center
capable of paradigmatic reconciliation, entrepreneurial action is “bookended” by two philosophically intractable positions grounded in
metaphysical assumption. Whereas for the realist these bookends consist of opportunity recognition and accuracy, for the constructionist they
represent the origination of intention and
whether individuals can realistically impose
their will on any system.

three economic theories considered highly influential to managerial thought on the subject of
entrepreneurial action. Following this, we discussed how the recognition that these theories
of the entrepreneur are theories of action, laden
with ontological assumptions about the social
world, highlights the need for greater scholarly
attention to both knowledge and motivation in
future theory building and empirical testing. Finally, we offered a pragmatic and a conceptual
solution, inspired by an action framework, as a
means of sidestepping or acknowledging philosophically intractable areas associated with the
examination of entrepreneurial action.
Given the renewed interest in the individual
within entrepreneurship research and the importance of the concept of opportunity to the
emerging field of entrepreneurship, we believe
that scholars who employ these economic theories of the entrepreneur will benefit from a
deeper understanding of their predictions, assumptions, limitations, and possibilities. Not
only does it appear that an action framework
provides this benefit to entrepreneurship, but
also we believe that entrepreneurship provides
a promising phenomenon to extend scholarly
understanding of the economics, psychology,
and sociology of human action.

CONCLUSION
We began this article with an examination of
the role that uncertainty plays in economic theories of the entrepreneur. After establishing the
need to consider knowledge and motivation concomitantly when examining entrepreneurial action, we proposed a two-stage conceptual model
of entrepreneurial action, built on these two constructs and consisting of an attention stage focused on the assessment of third-person opportunity (a possible opportunity for someone) and
an evaluation stage focused on the assessment
of first-person opportunity (a possible opportunity for the actor). We then used this model to
illustrate the conceptual limitations of using
system-wide theories of the entrepreneur at the
individual level of analysis by reinterpreting

examine the effect that perception has on subsequent action
