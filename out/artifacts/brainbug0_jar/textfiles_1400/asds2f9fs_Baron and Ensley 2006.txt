Meaningful Patterns: Evidence from Comparisons of

t is suggested that the recognition of new business opportunities often involves pattern recognition—the
cognitive process through which individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of events or
trends. Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive frameworks acquired through experience
(e.g., prototypes) play a central role in this process. Such frameworks provide individuals with a basis for
noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in
markets, changes in government policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these connections.
We propose that ideas for new products or services often emerge from the perception of such patterns. New
business opportunities are identiﬁed when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks, “connect the
dots” between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then detect patterns in these connections suggestive
of new products or services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the “business opportunity”
prototypes of novice (ﬁrst-time) and repeat (experienced) entrepreneurs—their cognitive representations of the
essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly
deﬁned, richer in content, and more concerned with factors and conditions related to actually starting and
running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash ﬂow) than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. These
ﬁndings offer support for the view that pattern recognition is a key component of opportunity recognition.

tion in opportunity recognition (e.g., Gaglio and Katz
2001, Hills and Shrader 1998, Kaish and Gilad 1991).
Similarly, additional studies have reported evidence
indicating that alertness, deﬁned by Kaish and Gilad
(1991, p. 48) as “a unique preparedness to recognize opportunities when they exist   ” also inﬂuences
opportunity recognition. As noted by Shane (2003),
alertness rests, at least in part, on cognitive capacities of individuals—capacities such as high intelligence and creativity (e.g., Vesalainen and Pihkala
1999). These capacities help speciﬁc persons identify
new solutions to market and customer needs in existing information, and to imagine new products and
services that do not currently exist (Hills et al. 2002).
As such, they play a key role in the identiﬁcation of
new business opportunities.1

When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of two
characters. One represents danger and the other represents
opportunity.
—John F. Kennedy (1959)

The ﬁeld of entrepreneurship generally concurs with
Kennedy’s words, recognizing both the risks of starting new ventures and the potential opportunities
that doing so provides. In fact, entrepreneurship
researchers have focused considerable attention on
investigating the nature of opportunity recognition—
the process through which ideas for potentially profitable new business ventures are identiﬁed by speciﬁc
persons (e.g., Kirzner 1979, Shane 2003). Research
on opportunity recognition has added greatly to our
understanding of this aspect of the entrepreneurial
process and, taken as a whole, provides clear evidence
for the role of several key factors in its occurrence.
For example, many studies point to the importance
of engaging in an active search for opportunities.
Indeed, there is considerable empirical support for
Shane’s (2003) suggestion that access to and attainment of appropriate information plays a crucial func-

1
It should be noted that alertness is distinct, at least to a degree,
from the related concepts of “mindfulness” or “heedfulness” (e.g.,
Weick 1996). These terms refer to general tendencies to process
incoming information in systematic and effortful ways, while alertness refers primarily to receptivity to opportunities—noticing them
when they exist.

Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns

Many other factors have also been found to inﬂuence
opportunity recognition, including prior knowledge of
a ﬁeld or industry (e.g., Shane 2001, McKelvie and
Wicklund 2004), speciﬁc search strategies, potential
entrepreneurs’ social networks (e.g., Ozgen and Baron
2006, Singh et al. 1999), and a wide range of cognitive factors, including attributions and intentions (e.g.,
Krueger 2003). While this prior research has added
greatly to our knowledge of opportunity recognition,
it does not, in general, address one fundamental question: What is the basic nature of this process? In
other words, how does opportunity recognition actually occur in the minds of speciﬁc persons? If it is
assumed that the recognition of new business opportunities does indeed involve cognitive events and processes experienced by individuals, then one possible
strategy for addressing this question involves applying the theories and methods of cognitive science to
this task.
One topic long investigated by cognitive science
that may be closely related to the identiﬁcation of new
business opportunities, and to the cognitive events
and processes that lead to such identiﬁcation, is pattern recognition—the process through which individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of
events or trends (e.g., Matlin 2005). Applying pattern
recognition to the identiﬁcation of business opportunities, it seems possible that speciﬁc persons recognize opportunities for new ventures because they perceive connections between apparently independent
events (e.g., advances in technology, changes in markets, shifts in government policies, to mention a few
possibilities), and then detect meaningful patterns in
these connections—patterns that point to new business opportunities.
Another aspect of theories of pattern recognition
with important implications for understanding opportunity recognition is the suggestion that cognitive
frameworks, developed through individuals’ unique
life experiences, play a crucial role in pattern recognition. Theories of pattern recognition suggest that
these cognitive frameworks serve as templates (patterns or guides), assisting speciﬁc persons to recognize connections between apparently independent
events and trends and to detect meaningful patterns
in these connections. This aspect of pattern recognition theories suggests an intriguing explanation for
the fact that particular business opportunities are
recognized by speciﬁc persons but not by others.
Brieﬂy, the persons who recognize speciﬁc opportunities may do so because they possess relevant cognitive
frameworks that help them accomplish this task—
frameworks that enable them to perceive the emergent patterns that underlie many new business opportunities. Perhaps a concrete example of how this process operates will be helpful.

Consider Chester Carlson, the individual credited
with developing the modern copy machine. Why was
he able to recognize the opportunity suggested by
a combination of technological advances, changes in
business practices, and changes in the ﬁeld of education (e.g., a huge growth in the number of college and
graduate students), while many others failed to perceive this opportunity—or at least—failed to perceive
an appropriate means of pursuing it? One possibility involves the fact that Carlson held both law and
technical degrees; and as a result he possessed welldeveloped cognitive frameworks (e.g., prototypes) for
interpreting information relating both to the needs
of potential customers (e.g., the need for clear copies
of legal documents) and several of the technical processes that might be used to meet this need. Further, once he decided to try to solve this problem, he
restricted his efforts (i.e., his active search) to technologies and processes he understood well (e.g., Fiet
et al. 2004). By focusing on processes for which he
already had well-developed cognitive frameworks, he
enhanced his own ability to perceive the emergent
pattern that then suggested to him an effective way of
making dry, permanent copies. In short, Carlson, possessed the cognitive frameworks necessary for perceiving connections between seemingly independent
events and trends (advances in several aspects of technology, changes in the needs of many businesses,
etc.) and for detecting an emergent pattern in these
connections—a pattern suggestive of the opportunity
he then pursued.
The present research was designed to gather evidence on these suggestions and on the potential role
of pattern recognition in identifying new business
opportunities. It sought to do so by comparing the
cognitive frameworks of two groups of entrepreneurs:
novice (ﬁrst-time) entrepreneurs and experienced
entrepreneurs (persons who have started several new
ventures). Because all individuals have unique life
experiences, their cognitive frameworks vary tremendously, reﬂecting the diversity of such experience.
For instance, individuals trained in a speciﬁc ﬁeld
or who work for many years in a particular industry will develop cognitive frameworks (e.g., prototypes) reﬂecting such experience. Moreover, their
cognitive frameworks will be very different in content from those developed by persons trained in
other ﬁelds or who work in other industries.2 To
consider this basic fact, we focused on one cognitive framework that is, presumably, possessed by all
entrepreneurs: prototypes for business opportunity.
2
As noted by one of the anonymous reviewers of this paper, such
development reﬂects the effects of learning, and it seems quite
likely that differences in learning style or approach may inﬂuence
the form and nature of these prototypes.

As will be explained in more detail below, the present
research focused on prototypes because they play a
key role in pattern recognition. However, other cognitive frameworks (e.g., schemas, tacit knowledge,
and procedural knowledge) may also be relevant
and should be examined in subsequent research (e.g.,
Gobet and Simon 1998, Sternberg 2004).
Below, we describe the speciﬁc hypotheses concerning such prototypes that we investigated. Before presenting these hypotheses, however, we ﬁrst brieﬂy
describe the nature of prototypes and the speciﬁc cognitive model on which the current research is based—
a major theory of pattern recognition (e.g., Matlin
2005).3

Prototype Theory: A Cognitive Model
of Pattern Recognition

While several different theories of pattern recognition
exist, one that is supported by a large body of evidence (e.g., Hahn and Chatter 1997) and that appears
to offer important insights into the nature of opportunity recognition, is known as prototype theory (e.g.,
Whittlesea 1997). This theory suggests that through
experience, individuals acquire prototypes, cognitive
frameworks representing the most typical member of
a category—the instance of that category best capturing its essential meaning or nature. Prototype models
of pattern recognition further suggest that as individuals encounter new events or objects, their existing
prototypes play an important role in the perception
of these events or objects and in the detection of connections between them. In essence, prototypes serve
as templates, assisting the persons who possess them
to notice links between diverse events or trends and
to perceive recognizable, meaningful patterns in these
connections. In part, this process involves comparison
of new events or objects with existing prototypes. If
the match is close, these events or objects are recognized as ﬁtting within the prototype. If, instead, the
match is not close, the events or objects are not perceived as ﬁtting within this cognitive framework. For
instance, consider the prototype for “car,” one cognitive framework most persons possess. This framework is broad enough so that everything from a
huge limousine or SUV to a small sports car can be
recognized as a “car,” while other objects used for
3
The question of whether opportunities exist in the external world
or are created by human minds is one that has been debated in
the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship for several years (e.g., Krueger 2003).
The position taken here is that there is, in fact, no essential contradiction between these views. Opportunities, as a potential, come
into existence as a result of changes in knowledge, technology, markets, and a wide range of political and social conditions; however,
they remain merely a potential until they emerge in speciﬁc human
minds as the result of active cognitive processes.

1333

transportation not matching this prototype well (e.g.,
motorcycles, scooters, bicycles) are excluded.
Applying prototype models to opportunity recognition, we suggest that entrepreneurs engage in an
analogous process with respect to identifying new
business opportunities. Speciﬁcally, they compare
ideas for new products, services, means of production, or markets with their existing prototype for
“business opportunity” (Shane 2003). The closer the
match, the more likely they are to conclude that
they have identiﬁed a potential business opportunity (cf., Craig and Lindsay 2001). Recall that in a
sense, prototypes represent the essential meaning of
a given cognitive framework or category; thus, to
the extent new products or services match an individual’s prototype for business opportunity, they are
perceived as ﬁtting within this category and thus as
offering the potential basis for a new venture. What
attributes would the prototype for business opportunity include? At present, no direct empirical evidence exists on this issue; indeed, identifying these
attributes is one purpose of this study. However,
drawing on extant deﬁnitions of opportunity (e.g.,
Herron and Sapienza 1992, Shane 2003), such features
as newness and potential proﬁtability might be central. It should be emphasized again, however, that the
speciﬁc content of the business opportunity prototype
is an empirical question—one that is addressed in this
research.
Theories of pattern recognition further suggest that
the cognitive frameworks (i.e., prototypes) playing a
role in this process change in several respects with
increasing experience (e.g., Knowlton 1997, Nosofsky
and Palmeri 1998). Among these changes, however,
are three that have received considerable emphasis—
shifts in clarity, richness of content, and degree of
focus on key attributes of the content domain. We reasoned that changes in these respects would be visible
in the business opportunity prototypes of novice and
experienced entrepreneurs. In other words, reﬂecting
differences in their experience as entrepreneurs, the
“business opportunity” prototypes of the two groups
would differ in several respects. We further reasoned
that to the extent such differences were found to
exist, this would provide evidence for the role of pattern recognition in the identiﬁcation of new business
opportunities.
With respect to clarity, previous research on prototypes (e.g., Matlin 2005) indicates that these cognitive frameworks become more clearly deﬁned with
increasing experience. One index of such clarity is the
degree to which the prototypes of different individuals converge on the same set of basic dimensions—in
other words, the extent to which the prototypes possessed by different persons agree on basic attributes.

<-----Page 3----->1334

Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns

For example, when automobiles were a new product, different individuals might well have included
different attributes in their prototypes for this new
method of transportation. As experience with automobiles increased, however, these prototypes would
be expected to show increasing agreement on basic attributes (e.g., all automobiles are self-propelled, have
a system for steering, a separate system for stopping,
etc.). Agreement with respect to basic dimensions is
generally interpreted as one indicant of increased prototype clarity (e.g., Knowlton 1997). On the basis of
this previous research, we formulated the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be more clearly deﬁned than
the opportunity prototypes of novice ( ﬁrst-time) entrepreneurs; that is, experienced entrepreneurs will show
greater agreement on the basic dimensions of this prototype.
Turning to richness of content, basic research on
prototypes indicates that this, too, increases with
growing experience. One measure of such richness
is the number of different dimensions included in
the prototype; this increases with growing experience
in the prototype domain. Considering the prototype
for automobiles once again, the number of attributes
or dimensions included in this prototype would be
expected to be relatively small initially—when automobiles were a new means of transportation—but
then to increase as individuals gained experience with
them. For instance, such attributes as “has doors,”
“possesses a windshield,” or “includes a control for
changing gears,” might be added to the basic dimensions described above. On the basis of this reasoning,
we propose the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be richer in content than the
opportunity prototypes of novice entrepreneurs (i.e., they
will include more discrete dimensions).4
Finally, additional research ﬁndings (Matlin 2005)
indicate that as individuals acquire experience in a
given domain, their prototypes become increasingly
focused on key attributes of that domain—attributes
related to the primary function or process of the
item or domain. With respect to prototypes for business opportunities, this suggests that such prototypes
would become increasingly focused on attributes of
4
As noted by one reviewer, it is possible that the relationship
between the number of dimensions in prototypes and experience
might be curvilinear in nature, with the number of dimensions
rising at ﬁrst but then decreasing after individuals become truly
expert in a given domain. However, recent research in cognitive
science on the topic of exceptional performance (e.g., Ericcson 2006)
suggests that this function might well be linear until extremely high
levels of expertise are attained.

Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, © 2006 INFORMS

opportunities related to actually starting and running
a new venture (e.g., meeting customer needs, capacity
to generate cash ﬂow, manageable risk, etc.) and less
focused on other attributes less central to starting or
running a new business (e.g., newness, uniqueness,
or generates feelings of excitement). This reasoning
suggested the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be more concerned than
those of novice entrepreneurs with factors or conditions
related to actually starting and running a new venture; in contrast, the opportunity prototypes of novice
entrepreneurs will more strongly emphasize attributes less
directly related to business processes (e.g., the novelty or
uniqueness of new products or services).
With respect to Hypothesis 3, it should be noted
that several previous studies indicate that focusing on
the “novelty” or “uniqueness” of opportunities may
be detrimental to the success of new ventures because
focusing on these issues can divert entrepreneurs’
attention from factors relating to the feasibility of
successfully developing speciﬁc opportunities, and in
fact, away from the question of whether the perceived
opportunities offer the potential for ﬁnancial gains or
are, instead, mainly illusory (“false alarms” in the language of signal detection theory; Archdivili et al. 2003,
Baron 2004a).

Method

To assess and compare the opportunity prototypes of
experienced and novice entrepreneurs, we asked carefully matched groups of experienced and novice (ﬁrsttime) entrepreneurs to respond to two open-ended
questions: “Describe the idea on which your new venture was based,” and “Why did you feel this was
a good idea—one worth pursuing?” Replies to these
items were then content analyzed (see below), and the
results of these analyses provided the primary data
for determining the content of the opportunity prototypes of novice and experienced entrepreneurs, and
for comparing these prototypes.
In addition, to obtain further information on the
cognitive frameworks employed by entrepreneurs to
identify new business opportunities, we also asked
participants in the study to describe ideas for new
products or services they had considered but ultimately rejected (“Describe an idea for a new product,
service, etc., that you considered but then ultimately
rejected”) and to indicate why they had rejected
such ideas (“Please indicate why you rejected this
idea”). While these data were considered subsidiary
to the data concerning identiﬁed opportunities, they
were analyzed in the same manner and are described
below.

Sample of Entrepreneurs
We obtained samples of both experienced and ﬁrsttime entrepreneurs through the assistance of entrepreneurial networking organizations in three major
southeastern U.S. cities. The executive directors of
these organizations sent our questionnaire to the
members of the networking organization (via e-mail
in PDF format) along with an accompanying cover
letter. Because most entrepreneurs have been involved
in only one new venture (Wright et al. 1997), we made
special efforts to obtain a sizeable sample of experienced entrepreneurs. Such persons, identiﬁed from
membership data provided by the entrepreneurial
networking organizations, were sent a second and
third e-mail requesting their participation in the
study. Through these procedures, we obtained the
cooperation of 88 experienced entrepreneurs and 106
novice entrepreneurs. A total of 521 entrepreneurs
were invited to participate in the study for an effective response rate of 39%.
In an effort to assess the possible impact of response
bias, we contacted 50 randomly selected nonrespondents directly on the telephone and requested input.
Thirty-two of them complied with the request. Comparison of respondents and nonrespondents indicated
that they did not differ with respect to any of the variables of interest in the present study.
Experienced Entrepreneurs. Eighty-two percent of
the experienced entrepreneurs were male, while 18%
were female; their average age was 39 years. The age
range was 22 to 54 years old and had a standard deviation of 4.2 years. Ninety percent were founders, and
86% held at least 10% of the equity in their respective companies. Experienced (repeat) entrepreneurs
had started an average of 2.6 companies. Virtually
all (98%) considered themselves entrepreneurs. With
respect to education, 14% held only high school diplomas, 10% held associates degrees, 40% had received
bachelors degrees, 21% had masters degrees, and 3%
held doctoral degrees. The ﬁrms these entrepreneurs
headed were drawn from 37 different industries,
ranging from light manufacturing to retail and also
included companies whose business activities focused
on information technology and on biotechnology.
These ﬁrms averaged 4.8 years of age with a range
of 2.6 years to 8.9 years with a standard deviation of
1.9 years.
Novice Entrepreneurs. Seventy-four percent of the
novice (ﬁrst-time) entrepreneurs were male and 26%
were female; their average age was 31 years. The age
range of the novice entrepreneurs was 21 to 44 years
with a standard deviation of 5.6 years. Ninety-ﬁve
percent were founders, and over 90% held at least
10% of the equity in their respective companies. All
of them considered themselves entrepreneurs. With

1335

respect to education, 11% held only high school diplomas, 7% held associates degrees, 54% had received
bachelors degrees, 33% had masters degrees, and 6%
held doctoral degrees. The ﬁrms headed by these
entrepreneurs were drawn from 42 different industries, including light manufacturing, retail, and both
biotechnology and information technology companies. These ﬁrms averaged 4.2 years of age with a
range of 1.2 years to 5.3 years with a standard deviation of 1.5 years.
Comparison of the Two Samples. In an effort to
examine potential differences between the novice and
experienced entrepreneurs aside from their experience in starting new ventures, we compared them
with respect to age, founding industry, race, and sex.
We conducted a t-test for age, and appropriate chisquare tests of the categorical variables of founding
industry, based on NAICS (North American Industrial Classiﬁcation System codes), race, and gender.
All tests were nonsigniﬁcant at the 0.05 level except
for respondent age. The experienced entrepreneurs
were signiﬁcantly older than the novice entrepreneurs
(39 versus 31 years; t = 291, p < 001). Because differences were observed for age, we included this variable in subsequent analyses (see below).
Data Reduction and Derivation of Prototypes
Because the data generated by our open-ended questions were both voluminous and complex, we employed methods of data reduction similar to those
used in basic research on the nature of prototypes
and pattern recognition to determine the content of
entrepreneurs’ opportunity prototypes (e.g., Chi et al.
1994, Matlin 2005, Ward et al. 1997). These procedures
involved the following steps:
Step 1. Entrepreneurs’ replies to the two questions
concerning their current company (“Describe the idea
on which your venture was based” and “Why did
you feel it was a good idea—one worth pursuing?”)
were ﬁrst analyzed by Ethnograph 5.0, a program
speciﬁcally designed for purposes of content analysis. Ethnograph 5.0 reports frequencies of words and
word phrases, and these frequencies are then used to
identify patterns in the responses provided by participants.
Step 2. Results provided by the Ethnograph 5.0 program were then discussed in detail by a panel of
three graduate students trained in methods of content
analysis and use of the Delphi technique for group
decisions. Panel members, who were unaware of the
entrepreneurs’ identities and did not know whether
they were novice or experienced entrepreneurs, then
met and attempted to identify distinct ideas or
attributes present in the entrepreneurs’ responses.
Step 3. Following these initial efforts to identify key
attributes or indicators in entrepreneurs’ responses,

panel members met with the researchers to discuss their preliminary results. After these discussions
(which served to clarify and reﬁne the initial data),
the panel met again and discussed each attribute until
unanimous agreement was reached about its presence
and meaning. These procedures yielded 47 distinct
attributes included by entrepreneurs in their descriptions of the ideas for their new ventures and in their
explanations as to why they viewed these as good
ideas. Examples of these attributes include uniqueness of the idea, extent to which it is based on innovative technology, length of the sales cycle, the ease with
which sales can be developed, and ﬁnancial characteristics of the situation.
Step 4. In an additional step, panel members reported the number of times each entrepreneur mentioned a particular attribute during the interview
(interviews lasted, on average, two hours). This procedure was used to enhance the psychometric properties of the ﬁnal dependent measure over and above
what would be obtained with a simple binary count
(e.g., “mentioned” or “did not mention” a particular
dimension). The panelists then met once again and
discussed the counts for each entrepreneur on each
dimension. The ﬁnal data generated by these procedures, therefore, were frequencies—the number of
times each entrepreneur mentioned each dimension
during the interview—based on consensus among the
panel members.5
These procedures (Ethnograph 5.0 in conjunction
with deliberations by panel members) yielded a score
for each participating entrepreneur on each of 47 indicators mentioned in their answers to the two open5
In addition, panel members rated, on 10-point scales, the extent
to which entrepreneurs mentioned each dimension. Analyses indicated that these ratings yielded results statistically equivalent to
those obtained from the frequency data. Therefore, as suggested by
two reviewers, we employed the frequency data, because such data
are less subject to potential sources of bias than ratings.

ended questions (“What was the idea for your business?” and “Why did you think it was worth pursuing?”). These were the primary data employed in
further analyses. (As noted earlier, data for the questions relating to rejected ideas were analyzed in the
same manner.)

Results

Means, standard deviations, and correlations for
study variables are presented in Table 1. The variables
shown are derived from analyses described in the following section (factor analyses), and reﬂect the key
dimensions of entrepreneurs’ opportunity prototypes
as identiﬁed in this research. (Further details concerning the nature of these variables is presented below.)
Identifying the Content of Entrepreneurs’
Prototypes for “Business Opportunities”: Factor
Analysis of Panel Rating Data
To determine the actual content of entrepreneurs’ prototypes for “business opportunity,” the 47 attributes
identiﬁed through the procedures described earlier
were ﬁrst divided, by the panel of graduate students,
into two groups. One group of attributes related to
the nature of the ideas entrepreneurs had identiﬁed
and were developing, while the second group related
to the reasons why they viewed these as good ideas,
worth developing. The 47 attribute dimensions were
divided into these two groups to consider the possibility that as a result of their growing experience in
starting new ventures, entrepreneurs might well alter
their criteria for deciding whether a given idea represents a bona ﬁde opportunity (i.e., is, or is not, worth
pursuing). Thus, this dimension is distinct from the
basic nature of the ideas themselves; to reﬂect this
fact, we analyzed data pertaining to the two questions
separately.
Twenty-three attributes were rated by the judges
as pertaining primarily to the nature of the entrepreneurs’ ideas for new ventures (e.g., viability of the

idea, extent to which a liquidity event was possible,
the market impact of the technology, and an ability
to dominate the market). Twenty-four attributes were
rated by the judges as pertaining primarily to the reasons entrepreneurs viewed these as good ideas, worth
pursuing (e.g., short sales cycle, unique technology,
few direct competitors, and advice from friends or a
ﬁnancial advisor). Separate factor analyses employing Quartimax Rotation were then performed on
these two sets of indicators (see, e.g., Kerlinger and
Lee 2000, Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). We used
Nunnally’s criterion for factor loadings of greater than
0.4 and the Eigenvalues greater than one criterion
(Kaiser’s Rule) for developing factors. The results of
these analyses (see Tables 2 and 3) indicated that ﬁve
clear factors related to the question, “Describe the
idea on which your venture was founded,” and ﬁve
clear factors related to the question, “Why did you
feel it was a good idea—one worth pursuing?”
As shown in Table 2, the following factors emerged
from the data for the question, ”Describe the idea
for your new venture”: (1) solving a customer’s
problems, (2) ability to generate positive cash-ﬂow
(+NCF), (3) manageable risk, (4) superiority of product/service, and (5) potential to change the industry.
As shown in Table 3, a different set of factors emerged
for the question, “Why did you feel it was a good
idea—one worth pursuing?”: (1) a favorable ﬁnancial

model, (2) positive assessments or advice from others (friends, ﬁnancial advisors, and industry experts),
(3) how novel the idea was, (4) the existence of a
large untapped market, and (5) intuition or gut feeling. These factors, which can be viewed as reﬂecting
the basic dimensions of the entrepreneurs’ business
opportunity prototypes, were then used as the basis
for testing the major hypotheses. It important to note
that these factors emerged from data provided by all
entrepreneurs who participated in the study. In other
words, they relate to the content of “business opportunity” prototypes generally, across both novice and
experienced entrepreneurs. Differences in the opportunity prototypes of these two groups are described
below.
Comparing the Business Opportunity Prototypes of
Experienced and Novice Entrepreneurs: Tests of
Major Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1 predicts that the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs will be more clearly deﬁned
than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. This
implies that experienced entrepreneurs will show
greater agreement concerning the basic dimensions
of their prototype for “business opportunity” than
novice entrepreneurs. (Such agreement on key dimensions has often been used as a measure of prototype clarity in basic cognitive research on this topic;

e.g., Knowlton 1997, Matlin 2005.) To assess such
agreement, we employed a measure of within-group
agreement developed by James et al. (1993), known
as the reliability within groups on j procedure, rWGJ 	 .
The rWGJ 	 yields a value between 0 and 1.0, with
scores above 0.70 denoting acceptable agreement.
We calculated rWGJ 	 for both experienced and ﬁrsttime entrepreneurs, and then compared the resulting
indices by means of appropriate t-tests. We calculated
rWGJ 	 for each factor created by the factor analysis and
then averaged the rWGJ 	 for these factors, for response
to each of the two open-ended questions.
Results indicated that consistent with Hypothesis 1, rWGJ 	 was indeed signiﬁcantly higher for experienced entrepreneurs than ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs
for both questions. For experienced entrepreneurs,
rWGJ 	 was 0.77 for the descriptions of the ideas on
which entrepreneurs based their new ventures, and
0.81 for what they considered a “good” idea. The corresponding values for ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs were
considerably lower, 0.41 and 0.53, respectively. T -tests
indicated that both differences (0.77 versus 0.41 and
0.81 versus 0.53) were signiﬁcant, p < 0001. Thus, as
predicted, the opportunity prototypes of experienced
entrepreneurs were indeed clearer, in one sense, than
those of novice entrepreneurs.
As a check on the validity of the rWGJ 	 measure, we
calculated Interclass Correlation Coefﬁcients (ICCs).

These coefﬁcients ranged from 0.76 to 0.83 for experienced entrepreneurs and from 0.43 and 0.57 for
novice entrepreneurs, a pattern very similar to that
obtained with the rWGJ 	 measure. Finally, as a further check on the validity of the rWGJ 	 measure, we
used SAS to calculate Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen 1968),
an index of the extent to which agreement within
groups of people is greater than would be expected on
the basis of chance. For both experienced and novice
entrepreneurs, the level of agreement was found to
be beyond chance (Cohen’s Kappa ranged from 0.36
to 0.42 for novice entrepreneurs and from 0.66 to 0.74
for experienced entrepreneurs).
Hypothesis 2 predicts that the business opportunity prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs will be
richer in content (i.e., involve more discrete dimensions) than the business opportunity prototypes of
novice entrepreneurs. To test this hypothesis, we
examined the number of dimensions employed by
entrepreneurs in both groups in describing the ideas
for their new ventures and why they felt these
were good ideas (i.e., viable). Each dimension mentioned was scored as 1, thus generating a possible range of 0–23 for descriptions of ideas for new
ventures, and 0–24 for descriptions of why these
were viewed by the entrepreneurs are being good
ideas. (Recall that 47 distinct attributes were previously identiﬁed in the entrepreneurs’ responses to
the two open-ended questions.) Separate chi-square

<-----Page 8----->Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns

1339

Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, © 2006 INFORMS

tests were then conducted for each of the two openended questions. Results indicated that for both questions, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs
did indeed involve more discrete dimensions than
the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. That is,
the “business opportunity” prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs included a signiﬁcantly larger
number of different dimensions (chi squareideas =
2041, p < 005, df = 1156; chi squaregoodness = 2793,
p < 001, df = 1326). Experienced entrepreneurs averaged nearly 14 different dimensions in their prototypes, versus approximately four dimensions for
novice entrepreneurs.
Hypothesis 3 suggests that the business opportunity prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs will
be more clearly focused than those of novice entrepreneurs on factors and conditions related to actually starting and running a new venture. To test this
hypothesis, we conducted two discriminant analyses.
(Such analyses indicate the extent to which individuals can be grouped or identiﬁed on the basis of a
given set of factors.) In the ﬁrst analysis, age was
included as a variable, along with the 10 basic factors identiﬁed earlier (Tables 2 and 3). In the second
discriminant analysis, age was not included as a variable. This two-stage assessment allowed us to test the
change in canonical R2 using the technique suggested
by Cohen and Cohen (1987). This test indicated that
the change in R2 produced by including age in the
analysis was not signiﬁcant; F = 117, p > 010. When
age was included in the analysis, the canonical R2
was 0.72 (Wilks’s lambda = 794, p < 0001). When
age was not included in the analysis, the canonical
R2 was 0.67; this reduction in R2 was not signiﬁcant
(p > 005; see Table 4). This suggests that age was not
a signiﬁcant factor in the contrasting prototypes of
novice and experienced entrepreneurs. The discriminant technique utilized was suggested by Hand (1981)

available in SAS. Nonparametric discriminant methods were utilized because of their robustness to violations of normality and other assumptions.
The discriminant function developed through the
above procedures was then applied to the respondents in both samples to assess the extent to which it
could correctly classify the entrepreneurs as “novice”
or “experienced.” Fully 94% of participants were
correctly classiﬁed in this manner. These ﬁndings
provide additional support for Hypothesis 3, suggesting that entrepreneurs can be accurately classiﬁed as
experienced or novice on the basis of the proﬁles of
their responses to questions asking them to describe
the ideas for their new ventures and why they viewed
these ideas as good. The discriminant proﬁle for
the experienced entrepreneurs included the following
dimensions: solving a customer’s problems, ability to
generate positive cash ﬂow, manageable risk, speed of
revenue generation, and others in their network with
whom to develop the venture. In contrast, the discriminant proﬁle for ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs included
the following dimensions: how novel the idea was,
whether it was based on new technology, superiority
or product/service, potential to change the industry,
and intuition or gut feel (see Table 5). In other words,
as suggested by Hypothesis 3, the business opportunity prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs seemed
to focus—to a greater extent than the business opportunity prototypes of novice entrepreneurs—on factors
and conditions directly related to actually starting and
running a new venture (e.g., the ability to generate
positive cash ﬂow and meeting customers’ needs).
In contrast, the business opportunity prototypes of
novice entrepreneurs tended to emphasize the “newness” or “uniqueness” of their product or service and
their “gut-level” belief in its potential.
Rejected Ideas: Further Comparisons of
Novice and Experienced Entrepreneurs
As noted earlier, entrepreneurs participating in the
study were also asked to describe ideas for new
products, services, etc., they had considered but ultimately rejected, and to indicate why they had rejected

<-----Page 9----->1340

Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns

these ideas. The data from these items were analyzed in the same manner as described previously
for ideas entrepreneurs decided to pursue. We predicted that the contrasting cognitive frameworks for
business opportunities of novice and experienced
entrepreneurs would be reﬂected in their reasons for
rejecting various ideas. Speciﬁcally, we expected that
novice entrepreneurs would reject ideas for new products or services because they did not seem to be sufﬁciently “novel,” were not based on new technology,
did not offer the potential to change an industry or
market in a major way, or were simply not sufﬁciently
“new” or “unique.” In contrast, we expected experienced entrepreneurs to reject ideas for new products or services because they did not offer sufﬁcient
promise of favorable ﬁnancial returns, short sales
cycles, manageable risk, and so on. Findings provided
support for these predictions. The discriminant proﬁle
for novice entrepreneurs indicated that they rejected
ideas they did not perceive to be sufﬁciently “novel,”
based on “new” technology, and that were not intuitively appealing. In contrast, the discriminant proﬁle
for the experienced entrepreneurs indicated that they
ultimately rejected ideas for new products or services
that did not offer clear potential for favorable ﬁnancial returns, short sales cycles, manageable risk, and
the potential for obtaining helpful input from advisors. In short, novice entrepreneurs appeared, again,
to emphasize the “novelty,” “newness,” or “personal
excitement” of identiﬁed ideas, and to reject as potential opportunities ideas for new products or services
that were not high on these dimensions. In contrast,
experienced (repeat) entrepreneurs emphasized factors relating to ﬁnancial returns, and rejected ideas
that they perceived to be relatively low on such
dimensions.

Discussion

Overall, results offer support for the suggestion that
the basic cognitive process of pattern recognition
may indeed play a role in identifying new business
opportunities. By extension, theories of pattern recognition suggest that the cognitive frameworks (prototypes) used by experienced and novice entrepreneurs
to identify business opportunities will differ in predictable ways—speciﬁcally with respect to clarity,
richness of content, and focus on factors or conditions directly relevant to starting and running a
new venture. Results are consistent with these predictions. Experienced entrepreneurs showed greater
agreement than novice entrepreneurs concerning the
central attributes or dimensions of the concept “business opportunity”—one indication that their prototypes are more clearly deﬁned (Hypothesis 1). In
addition, the “business opportunity” prototypes of

Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, © 2006 INFORMS

experienced entrepreneurs were richer in content—
they included more distinct dimensions than those of
novice entrepreneurs (Hypothesis 2). Finally, experienced entrepreneurs appeared to focus more attention
than novice entrepreneurs on factors and dimensions
closely related to actually starting and running new
ventures—to converting identiﬁed opportunities into
realized ﬁnancial gains (e.g., manageable risk, meeting customers’ needs, and generation of positive cash
ﬂow; Hypothesis 3). Consistent with the opening
quotation of this paper, and with research concerning environmental threats and opportunities (e.g.,
Dutton and Jackson 1987), experienced entrepreneurs
included awareness of “danger” as well as “opportunity” in their thinking. In contrast, the opportunity prototypes of novice entrepreneurs were more
focused on “newness,” “novelty,” perceived superiority of the entrepreneurs’ new products or services,
and intuition (i.e., “gut-level feelings”). In light of
these ﬁndings, it is, perhaps, far from surprising that
a large proportion of new ventures fail—especially
new ventures started by novice entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Azoulay and Shane 2001, Thornhill and Amit 2003).
If their founders are, in a sense, “cognitively dazzled”
by the novelty and perceived potential of the ideas
behind their new businesses, they may fail to devote
sufﬁcient attention to several ﬁnancial and business
factors that strongly affect the success of new ventures; lack of attention to these factors can indeed
prove fatal. One reason why novice entrepreneurs
may place so much emphasis on these factors is that
lacking experience with respect to actually starting
new ventures, their prototypes of business opportunities are strongly shaped by stories in the popular business press—stories that often emphasize the
“newness” or “uniqueness” business entrepreneurs
have developed into highly successful new ventures
(Baron and Shane 2006).
Overall, these differences between the opportunity
prototypes of experienced and novice entrepreneurs
suggest that, as might be expected, experienced entrepreneurs are much more concerned with issues and
processes that would be of interest to major stakeholders in their new ventures. In other words, they
think about opportunities in more sophisticated and
pragmatic ways from a business-model point of view,
than novice entrepreneurs. In this way, their experience in starting new ventures does appear to be
highly beneﬁcial to them.
Findings for ideas entrepreneurs rejected offered
additional support for this overall pattern. Again,
novice entrepreneurs emphasized newness, novelty,
and intuition in rejecting ideas for new products,
services, etc. In contrast, experienced entrepreneurs
tended to focus on factors pertaining to ﬁnancial success, rejecting ideas for new products or services that

<-----Page 10----->Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns
Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, © 2006 INFORMS

did not appear to offer manageable risk, the capacity
to generate positive cash ﬂow, and so on. Together,
the ﬁndings for ideas entrepreneurs did identify as
constituting business opportunities and ideas they
rejected as falling outside this category suggest that
the cognitive frameworks employed by entrepreneurs
do indeed develop with increasing experience, as theories of pattern recognition suggest (e.g., Whittlesea
1997).
Another reason why the tendency of novice entrepreneurs to emphasize newness, uniqueness, and
intuition in their prototypes of “business opportunity” may have negative consequences for their new
ventures is suggested by a large body of evidence
concerning the impact of emotional states on cognitive performance. This research indicates that when
individuals experience strong, positive affect (positive emotions or feelings), their capacity to think systematically and evaluate information carefully may
be signiﬁcantly reduced (e.g., Ruder and Bless 2003).
It seems possible that novice entrepreneurs tend to
“fall in love with their own ideas,” and so experience extremely high levels of enthusiasm, optimism,
and positive affect. While these intense affective states
can sometimes contribute to creativity (Estrada et al.
1997), they have also been found, in many studies, to
strongly interfere with the ability to engage in systematic thought (e.g., Forgas 2004).
At this point, it should be emphasized, once again,
that experienced entrepreneurs acquire these welldeveloped cognitive frameworks through processes of
learning—processes that occur as they gain experience in the intricacies of starting new ventures. The
importance of learning in key organizational processes has been emphasized in a large body of recent
research (e.g., Honig 2001, March 1991, Moorman and
Miner 1998, Miner et al. 2001), and it certainly plays
a role—along with pattern recognition—in equipping
entrepreneurs with the “cognitive raw materials” on
which to base opportunity recognition. In fact, it
seems reasonable to suggest that learning is the process through which individuals acquire the cognitive
frameworks they then use in identifying viable business opportunities. In this respect, we are reminded
of the words of one experienced entrepreneur with
whom we are acquainted—an individual who has
started numerous companies in a wide range of
industries. As he puts it: “When I look at many situations, I think, ‘There has to be a better way.’ And then
I draw on my experience to ﬁgure out what that could
be.” In other words, this entrepreneur’s experience
helps him to “connect the dots” and recognize opportunities he can then develop. It should also be noted
that well-developed prototypes are not necessarily
an unmixed blessing where identifying new business
opportunities are concerned. Such frameworks can

1341

indeed assist individuals in noticing links between
various changes or events in the external world; however, they can also inhibit individuals from noticing
such connections by directing their thinking into speciﬁc, well-established channels that are, in one sense,
inimical to innovation (e.g., Garud and Rappa 1994).
Thus, it should certainly not be assumed that development of increasingly strong, developed prototypes
is beneﬁcial in all respects or all instances.
One interesting implication of the present ﬁndings
relates to the question of what, speciﬁcally, experienced entrepreneurs acquire from their growing experience in starting new ventures. While it seems clear
that they obtain many forms of knowledge and a wide
array of skills, the results of this study suggest that
one key thing they acquire is increasingly focused and
reﬁned mental frameworks for identifying business
opportunities. In other words, through their experience in founding new ventures, repeat entrepreneurs
acquire cognitive frameworks (e.g., more fully developed prototypes) that are increasingly helpful to them
in “connecting the dots” between seemingly unrelated
changes or events and in detecting meaningful patterns in these links. In short, the cognitive frameworks
developed by experienced entrepreneurs assist them
in recognizing opportunities that others overlook, and
in selecting those opportunities most likely to yield
positive ﬁnancial outcomes.6
At this point, it is interesting to note that in several
respects, experienced entrepreneurs may be similar
to experts in any ﬁeld. Research on expertise suggests that as individuals gain experience in a given
domain, they learn to focus attention primarily on key
dimensions—the ones most relevant to the activity
they are performing (e.g., Choo and Trotman 1991).
Similarly, they also gain increasingly reﬁned, welldeveloped, and useful mental frameworks (e.g., categories and prototypes) for performing many tasks
(e.g., Gobbo and Chi 1986). In addition, recent ﬁndings (e.g., Ericsson 2006) suggest that through participation in prolonged deliberate practice, experts may
actually enhance their basic cognitive systems. For
instance, they may acquire closer links between working memory and long-term memory and, as a result,
be better able to draw on previously acquired information when making current decisions or judgments
6
As suggested by reviewers, it would be interesting to compare
novice entrepreneurs with ones having moderate experience (e.g.,
entrepreneurs who have started 2–3 companies), and ones having more extensive experience (e.g., four or more companies).
Such comparisons would provide information on the rate at which
entrepreneurs acquire, through learning, increasingly reﬁned prototypes for “business opportunities.” Unfortunately, the number of
entrepreneurs in the present sample who had started four or more
companies was very small (a total of only 16), so such analyses
were not feasible with the present data set.

<-----Page 11----->1342

Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns

(e.g., Ericsson 2006). It seems reasonable to suggest
that similar processes may be at work among experienced entrepreneurs who, in a sense, become experts
in recognizing opportunities and in starting new ventures. These and related possibilities can be readily
examined in future research.
Theoretical Implications
The present ﬁndings appear to have important theoretical implications. As noted earlier, the results of
this study underscore the potential value of applying existing theories of cognitive science—and especially, theories of pattern identiﬁcation—to important
aspects of the entrepreneurial process. This conclusion is consistent with a large, rapidly growing literature on entrepreneurial cognition, research focused on
the potential role of cognitive factors and processes
in entrepreneurship (e.g., Baron 2004b, Gaglio 2004,
Busenitz and Arthurs 2006, Krueger 2003, Mitchell
et al. 2004). This previous research has been based, to
a large degree, on the ﬁndings and theories of cognitive science. The present ﬁndings suggest that further insights into various aspects of entrepreneurship
can be gained through careful application of additional ﬁndings and theories of cognitive science, for
instance, from basic research on the cognitive foundations of expertise (e.g., Ericsson 2006) or from research
on the origins of creative thought (e.g., Ward 2004).
Similarly, research on signal detection theory, one cognitive theory of decision making, may provide important insights into the mechanisms through which
entrepreneurs distinguish between bona ﬁde opportunities and false alarms—opportunities that are more
illusory than real (e.g., McMullen and Shepherd 2006).
In short, extant theories and principles of cognitive science may provide the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship with theories, principles, and research methods useful in understanding important aspects of the
entrepreneurial process (e.g., Baron and Ward 2004).
Limitations of the Present Research
Before concluding, several limitations of the present
research should be carefully noted. First, although we
attempted to match experienced and novice entrepreneurs as closely as possible, the two groups differed in one respect aside from their experience in
starting new ventures: The experienced entrepreneurs
in our sample were somewhat older than the novice
entrepreneurs. Given that age and experience are
often highly correlated, and that starting new ventures requires signiﬁcant amounts of time, this difference is not surprising. However, its presence raises
the possibility that differences in the cognitive frameworks (i.e., prototypes) of experienced and novice
entrepreneurs observed in the present research might
have derived—at least in part—from this factor. Two

ﬁndings suggest that cognitive differences between
experienced and novice entrepreneurs did not stem
from differences in age: (1) the discriminant analyses in which age was, and was not, included as
a variable produced very similar results (canonical
R2 of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, which did not differ signiﬁcantly); and (2) classiﬁcation accuracy was
not increased (by only 1%) when age was included
in the discriminant function. However, future studies seeking to compare the cognitive frameworks of
experienced and novice entrepreneurs to determine
how these frameworks change as a result of increased
experience should make strenuous efforts to minimize
any age disparity between these groups.
Another limitation of the present research is that
all the data collected are retrospective in nature:
Both novice and experienced entrepreneurs reported
on events that had occurred in the past. Cognitive
scientists have found that memory is subject to considerable distortion and change over time. Information entered into memory is frequently altered over
the course of days, months, or years through selective forgetting and other processes (e.g., Seamon et al.
2002). Given the scope and breadth of such memorydistortion processes, the present data must be interpreted with caution. To minimize such effects, we
focused, in this study, on entrepreneurs’ descriptions
of events relating to their current companies. Because
both groups (novice and experienced entrepreneurs)
reported on the company they were now running,
memory distortion would be expected to be relatively
equal in both groups. Thus, it seems unlikely that
the differences between the two groups with respect
to their prototypes stemmed primarily from this factor. However, because all retrospective data are subject to potential sources of distortion, only additional
research speciﬁcally designed to examine the impact
of such factors can provide direct evidence on their
effects or eliminate them as potential contributors to
the present ﬁndings.
Third, we should note that in this research, we
did not include industry or type of new venture
(e.g., technology versus nontechnology) as a variable.
Because the process of new venture creation may well
vary as a function of such factors, this, too, is a limitation with respect to generalizing the present results.
Fourth, as noted by one reviewer of this paper, the
tendency of experienced entrepreneurs to focus their
business opportunity prototypes on factors or conditions related to actual business processes to a greater
extent than novice entrepreneurs might reﬂect, in
part, that these persons have left previous companies
to start new ones. This could lead them to emphasize
such factors as cash ﬂow and risk to a greater extent
than novice entrepreneurs lacking such experiences.
The present ﬁndings may reﬂect this factor rather

<-----Page 12----->Baron and Ensley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns
Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, © 2006 INFORMS

than differences in prototype development. Finally,
we should note that the novice entrepreneurs in this
study headed companies that had existed for several
years. Thus, in a sense, they were not “raw beginners;” rather, they had already achieved at least modest success because the companies they had founded
were still operating.
Despite these limitations, the ﬁndings of the present
research do appear to offer several useful contributions. First, they suggest that opportunity recognition
may be related to pattern recognition. This, in turn,
provides a useful means for applying well-developed
theories of cognitive science to the task of understanding the basic nature of opportunity recognition. Second, the present results shed new light on why some
persons are better at recognizing opportunities than
others: In essence, they may possess better-developed
cognitive frameworks for accomplishing this task.
Finally, and perhaps most important, the ﬁndings of
this research suggest that experienced entrepreneurs
do indeed acquire increasingly reﬁned cognitive
frameworks (prototypes) for identifying new business
opportunities. As a result, they may gain an important advantage over novice entrepreneurs in terms
of choosing the opportunities most likely to lead to
proﬁtable new ventures. To put it succinctly, one reason that experienced entrepreneurs may be more successful than novice entrepreneurs in identifying excellent business opportunities may be that experienced
entrepreneurs have learned to think in ways that help
them keep their eyes ﬁrmly on what is “feasible” and
“potentially proﬁtable,” while avoiding the potential
trap of being swept away by what is merely “new”
or “unique.”
