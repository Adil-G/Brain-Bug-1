An Investigation into the New Product Process:
Steps, Deficiencies, and Impact
Robert G. Cooper and Elko J. Kleinschmidt

In a comprehensive study of 252 new product histories at 123 firms, Robert Cooper and Elko Kleinschmidt looked critically at the new products management process. Each company was shown a set of
13 activities which formed a general "skeleton" of a
new product process. This article examines how this
structure was modified by the companies and how
well various stages of the process were reportedly
executed. The results show a variety of practices
among the surveyed companies. While the presence
of activities cannot guarantee successful new products, certain activities were singled out as particularly weak. Firms should consider placing more emphasis on market studies, initial screening activities,
and preliminary market assessment. The article provides a though(ful assessment of the level of implementation of current practices in new products
management.

Introduction

New products are critical to the growth and prosperity
of most firms, but product innovation is plagued by
high risks: both the large amounts at stake and the high
probability of failure [2,4,8]. Most recently, there has
been a call to focus on the new product process itself as
the key to a more successful new product program
[1,3,9]. This article reports the results of a new research study--NewProd Phase ll--that looks closely
at the new product process: what happens, how well
various steps are carried out, and what impact each step
has on new product outcomes.

Winners and Losers

Recent years have witnessed several notable studies
into what makes a new product a success. Investigations such as the British SAPPHO [14,15], Rubenstein's U.S. study [16], NewProd in Canada [5,6,7],
and the recent Standford Innovation Project [ 11 ] paint a
fairly consistent picture, in spite of different methodologies and locales. These investigations conclude
that the following factors are fundamental to new product success:

mance-to-cost ratio; and economic advantages
(cost-benefit) to the customer.
An understanding of users' needs, wants, and preferences and a strong market orientation, with marketing inputs playing an important role in shaping
the concept and design of the product.
A strong launch effort: selling, promotion, and
distribution.
Technological strengths and synergy: a good fit between the product's technology and the technological resources and skills of the firm.
Marketing synergy: a good fit between the marketing, sales force, and distribution needs of the product and the firm's marketing resources and skills.
An attractive market for the new product: a high
growth market, a large market, and one with a high
long-term potential; a market with weak competition and one lacking intense competitive activity.
Top management support and commitment.

R.G. COOPERAND E. J. KLEINSCHMIDT

Although such studies have shed much light on new
product success, they also raise questions. Consider
these issues:
Many of these success factors describe the setting
of the project. For example, having marketing
synergy, possessing technological synergy, and
being in a high-growth, attractive market are
useful criteria for project selection. But beyond
project selection, what can the manager do to
score high on these success factors? In short,
many success factors appear to be beyond the
control of the project manager.
Other success factors identified in these studies
are within management's control. For example,
adopting a strong marketing orientation, designing a product with a differential advantage, and
mounting a strong launch effort are all things that
people do and control. What is lacking, however,
are the specifics: Exactly what does a manager do
to become market oriented or to conceive a superior product? In short, these success factors are
left fairly general; they are not translated into the
details of what managers and new product project
teams should do.
In the book, In Search of Excellence, Peters and
Waterman make a strong case for attention to detail:
that success and failure boil down to what people do
and how well they undertake these tasks [ 13]. Many of
the authors' prescriptions are disarmingly simple. Similarly, Booz, Allen and Hamilton's study of new product management reveals that the new product process--what happens in those steps from idea to product
launch--is key to success [ l ]. The study concludes that
firms that have a disciplined, step-wise new product
process are more successful and that those firms that
have had the process in place for a longer time do still
better.
Could it be that the majority of new product success
and failure studies have overlooked the obvious? Could
it be that we have been so preoccupied with the "big
picture"--questions of strategy, synergy, orientation,
and selecting the right technology and market areas-that we have missed key factors in success? For example, few of the success/failure studies have looked at
what actually happens during a new product project;
fewer still have investigated the strengths and weaknesses of the activities that comprise the new product

<-----Page 2----->AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE NEW PRODUCT PROCESS

process and the impact that their activities have on projects' outcomes. If what happens during the new product process itself--the action details--is key to success, then a clear need exists to examine more closely
those actions or activities that make up the new product
process.

The Research

The investigation described in this article addresses
some of these questions; following are specific research
questions:
What happens as a new product project moves
from idea to launch'? What occurs within each
stage of the process--what do people do'?
How well are the tasks or activities undertaken'?
And what improvements are needed'?
What is the impact of each of these activities on
project outcomes: commercial success or failure.
Does excellence in each of these tasks really
matter'?

NewProd H

NewProd Phase II is an extensive and detailed study of
123 firms and 252 actual new product case histories.
Only some of the data and findings of the investigation
are reported in this article.
In the summer of 1985, senior management in 200
firms was contacted, and 123 firms agreed to participate in the study. The sample of firms was restricted to
industrial product manufacturers, who were known to
be active in the field of product development, based on
both a government listing of firms conducting R&D
and private sources. All firms were located in Ontario
and Quebec, Canada.
In each firm, those managers most responsible for
new products were personally interviewed. In small
firms, these included company presidents and vice
presidents; in larger firms, they were directors of marketing, R&D, engineering, and/or new products. Two
or three new product projects were discussed in detail
per firm: a commercial success, a commercial failure,

73

and a "killed" project. 1 The interviews lasted 3 to 4
hours each and were based on a detailed, pretested
questionnaire.
One facet of the interview focused on the new product process. Here, managers were asked to relate the
story of each project--a "blow-by-blow" description
of what happened from idea to launch. Next, respondents were queried about each of the 13 activities
that were thought to comprise the new product process.
Respondents were aided in their recall: A brief description of each activity was provided, and respondents
indicated whether such an activity was undertaken as
part of the project. The 13 particular activities considered were based on both normative and empirically
based descriptions of the new product process and are
listed in Exhibit 1 [1,3,10,12,15,17].
Each activity was probed in greater detail, using
both open-ended (verbal, descriptive) and closed-ended (e.g., rating scales) questions. Only data from projects that were eventually launched into the market are
considered in this article: a total of 203 projects, including 123 commercial successes and 80 commercial
failures.

Results: The New Product Process

What the literature prescribes and what most firms do
are miles apart when it comes to the new product process. This was one provocative finding of the study.
The literature features numerous process models that
describe how firms should develop new products. Reality is much different. Reviews of what actually happened in these 203 projects revealed that many commonly accepted and prescribed stages or activities are
altogether omitted from the process. Exhibit 2 shows
the frequency results, that is, in what proportion of the
203 projects a given stage or activity was carried out
and identified as a recognizable stage or step in the
process. Some highlights from Exhibit 2 follow:
â¢ Commonly prescribed activities, such as a market
research study, a trial sell, and a detailed business

ISuccess and failure were defined from a profitability standpoint:
whether or not the product's profits exceeded or fell short of the acceptable
profitability level for this type of investment.

analysis, were undertaken in less than half the
projects studied.
â¢ The weakest activities (most often omitted) were
two of the market tasks: test market or trial sell

(done in only 22.5% of the cases) and a detailed
market study or marketing research (done in only
25.4% of the projects).
Other weak activities--undertaken in less than
half of the projects studied--were precommercialization business analysis and trial production.
When one stands back and looks at the entire new
product process, very few projects--only 1.9%--featured all 13 activities. Exhibit 3 shows the results. Indeed, in the majority of projects studied, less than 9 of
the possible 13 activities were carried o u t - - a limited
new product process. Further, in almost one third
(32.7%) of the projects, seven activities or less were
undertaken, that is, approximately half the new product
process.
Note that there may be good reasons why certain
commonly recommended steps of the new product process should be omitted. This is particularly true in the
case of product improvements and line extensions,
where a shortened process may be appropriate. However, the data here are based on new product items, not
marginal extensions and minor modifications. Moreover, the frequency of omission was substantial, certainly more than one might have expected from the
occasional deletion of a step in the process. The evidence suggests that the new product process in practice
is a truncated one, particularly when compared to prescribed process models.

Proficiencies of Activities

In those cases where a certain activity had been undertaken, we probed to determine how well the activity
was carried out and to what extent improvements were
thought to be required. Exhibit 4 shows the mean results for each activity. (Proficiency was measured on a
0 to 10 scale, where 0 is very poor and very deficiently
handled, and 10 is excellent and very well handled;
similarly, the need for improvement was also gauged
on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 indicated improvements not
needed at all and 10 indicated major improvements
needed.) Following are some highlights:
* Overall, the mean proficiency score for all activities was a mid-range 5 to 6 out of 10--not a

stellar performance. The standard deviations
were in the 2 to 3 range (not shown), pointing to a
fairly broad variation in performance.
There were few major differences in proficiencies
across activities. The weakest rated activities
were the "up front" or predevelopment activites,
namely initial screening, preliminary market assessment, and the detailed market study.
On average, managers indicated moderate need
for improvement: in the 3 to 5 range on the 0 to l0
scale. Activities singled out for the greatest improvements were, not surprisingly, the same
three up front activities: the detailed market
study, initial screening, and preliminary market
assessment.

Here, then, is a summary of these activities across
projects.

The Idea
Typically, the new product process was initiated by a
product idea that was market derived--from a customer, salesperson, or competitor. There was less tendency
for ideas to be technology driven--an in-house, lab,
technical group, or supplier source. For example, on a
0 to 10 scale, where 0 meant "market source," the
average idea scored 3.66, that is, close to the marketderived end of the scale.
The idea did not typically come forth as the result of
a proactive, aggressive search. The average idea scored
4.49 on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 meant "passive
search" and 10 meant "aggressive/proactive" search.
The specific sources of ideas were also determined
and appear, in descending order of frequency, in Table 1.

Initial Screening
Space does not permit a detailed description of what
happened in each project at each stage of the process.

Initial screening, although undertaken in over 90% of
projects, was rated as the weakest activity, scoring

lowest on the proficiency scale, and cited as an activity
greatly in need of improvement. A variety of different
approaches to screening were uncovered and may suggest why screening was thought to be so deficient. They
are listed, in terms of popularity, in Table 2.
Group processes dominated this critical screening
decision: the initial " g o " decision was a group decision in more than three quarters of the cases. But
screening remains very much an informal decision, that
is, no consistently used checklist of criteria or scoring/rating procedures. For example, in less than 2% of
the projects, evaluators used a formal checklist questionnaire or scoring model to rate projects.
Initial screening was also pinpointed as one of the
activites where improvements were sorely needed.
Managers were queried about the types of improvements desired, and the main suggestions are listed in
Table 3.

Preliminary market assessment was also rated as a
weak activity. It was omitted altogether in almost one
quarter of the projects and, when done, was rated a
weak 5.47 out of 10, on average.
Preliminary market assessment involved a varied set
of tasks. The most frequently mentioned appear in
Table 4. Direct customer contact, however, dominated
the list.
Preliminary market assessment was also singled out
as one stage in need of improvement. A sharper, more
focused definition of the market, more customer contacts, and the allocation of more time and effort were
the suggestions most frequently cited.

Preliminary Technical Assessment
This activity was rated moderately strongly: it was undertaken in the great majority of projects (84.9%) and
was rated as proficiently undertaken. The main tasks
carried out are listed in Table 5.
Although preliminary technical assessment was not
viewed as a major problem area by managers, there
were, nonetheless, several suggestions for improvement:

The majority of these market studies focused on the
domestic market only (43,2% of cases). A handful of
studies (18.9%) included nearby export trading areas 4,
whereas a surprising 37.8% of the studies investigated
markets and countries outside the domestic and immediate trading area, that is, rest-of-world countries.
The market research stage was cited as an area where
many improvements were needed and possible. Suggestions included the following:
Better focus--better definition of specific market
and segments as the target of the investigation.

â¢ More thorough technical assessment,
â¢ More application oriented and focused.

More effort--for example, a larger scope study;
more contacts and interviews; more depth to the
interviews.

â¢ Better organized and with more qualified people.
â¢ More formal and better documented.

A better definition of the product and technology
before embarking on a field or customer survey.
More specificity--improved definition of what
one is trying to find out (clearer information
objectives).

Market Research~Detailed Market Study
The detailed market study stage was among the weakest
of all 13 activities in the entire new product process. It
was undertaken in only one quarter of the projects and,
when carried out, was rated "poorly handled," on
average.
A variety of different types of market studies were
undertaken. They appear, in order of popularity, in
Table 6.
Concept tests--a study of customer reactions to the
proposed new product in concept f o r m - - w e r e noticeably absent.
The methods used for these market studies also varied from project to project. The most popular involved
personal interviews or detailed face-to-face interactions with customers (31.0% of cases); other firms used
outside consultants (24.1%); still others employed no
scientific, formal, or structured approach (27.6%).
Mail and phone surveys were rarely used in this stage.

Business~Financial Analysis
Many firms (62.9% of cases) conducted a business or
financial analysis prior to moving into product development. A variety of methods are shown in Table 7.
Few managers cited improvements that might be
needed in this business analysis, but there was a call for
more multidisciplinary, multidepartmental inputs;
more market information and input from customers;
more time and effort spent on business analysis; and
more formal, consistent procedures.

Product Development
Product development--the actual design and development of the product--was perceived by managers as a
well-handled activity, on average. There were no specific or unusual techniques uncovered here. However,
there were suggestions for improvement.

1. Selling the product to a sample of selected
customers only,
2. Selling the product in a limited/specific
geographic area only.

A more formally laid-out process, with better coordination among people and departments.
More depth and detail regarding technical issues/problems/questions during development.
More resources required: more and more experienced people; better facilities.
More time and effort to be spent.

Product Testing--In-House
Following product development, the product was typically subjected to a set of in-house tests (88.9% of
cases). This stage was rated as the strongest one, on
average. The most common approaches to product testing included those listed in Table 8. Requested improvements included more time and effort to be spent
on testing, and a more detailed, formal, and rigorous
testing procedure.

Product Testing with the Customer
This was a fairly well-rated activity and one that was
undertaken in the majority of projects studied (66.3%

of cases). Most often, the customer test involved giving
a sample or prototype of the product to the customer at
no charge and letting the customer try the product
(77.9% of customer tests). In a minority of projects
(14.2%), there was a rigorously designed customer
test, complete with written testing procedures. In a few
projects (7.1%), the customer was brought to the company's premises for an on-site user test of the product.
Improvements mentioned included a more thorough
testing program (more tests undertaken at more test
sites and at more representative sites) and better control
over the customer tests.

Test Market/Trial Sell
This activity was undertaken least frequently of all 13
activities in the process: Only 22.5% of projects featured a trial sell/test market. But, when undertaken,
this step was proficiently executed. Typically, a trial
sell involved the approaches given in Table 9.
Trade shows and reduced price/rental schemes were
also employed to provide a trial sell of the product. Few
improvements were recommended here, but these included better/sharper definition of the test market customers and more objective and better measures of the
test market results.

Table 8. In-House Testing

Approach
1. Prototype testing: to determine if the product
functioned properly and reliably.
2. Operating tests: tests to check the
functionality/reliability of the product under
real-life working conditions.
3. Specifications check: tests and checks to
determine if the product met specifications,
outside design standards, etc.
4. Field tests of the product.

Trial Production
Trial production was carried out in less than half the
projects but, when undertaken, was rated proficiently.
The two focuses typical to a trial production are shown
in Table 10.
Improvements requested here were few but included
better training of production employees, better control
over the production system, and better coordination
among departments and people. More feedback and
better measures were also suggested.

Table 10. Trial Production

Focus
1. A test of the production system itself (e.g.,
that production equipment ran properly).
2. A test of the integrity of the product that
the production system yielded (e.g., to see
that the resulting product specs were met).

Precommercialization Business Analysis
Managers were queried about whether or not a detailed
business analysis was undertaken after product development, but before full launch. Only a minority of
projects (34.8%) featured such an analysis; but typically, if carried out, it was handled proficiently. The
methods used for the final " g o / n o g o " decision are
listed in Table 1 I. Suggestions on how to make this
final go/no go decision more effective included a total
"start-from-scratch" review; revision and update of all
data; and better market information, including inputs
from a market acceptance or test market study.

Production Start-up
In the majority of cases, production start-up was a relatively straightforward activity. It was recognized as a
distinct stage in 56% of the projects and was rated fairly
proficiently. It involved either no changes to the existing production facilities (12.5% of cases) or few
changes (35.0% of projects). In 31.3% of the projects,
production start-up meant acquisition and commissioning of significantly new equipment and production facilities and, in a few cases, a new factory. Extraordinary quality control checks for start-up were implemented in only 7.5% of the projects.

Approach
1. Trade literature, trade shows, and trade
advertising but no special promotion or
training for the sales forcc.
2. Trade literature, trade shows, and trade
advertising plus a strong sales force
promotional effort: demonstrations,
conferences, and seminars for customers.
3. Trade literature, trade shows, and trade
advertising plus special training for the sales
force.
4. Very limited efforts: virtually nothing special
done for the launch.

A variety of improvements in this phase of the process were suggested: better coordination; better management; more detailed documentation and procedures;
and more resources, namely time, money, and qualified people.

Market Launch
The launch stage was rated moderately postively on
average. Surprisingly, in over 30% of the projects, the
launch stage was not formally recognized as a distinct
and identifiable stage or activity.
The projects were all industrial products, and launch
efforts were limited to those listed in Table 12.
Numerous possible improvements were identified
for the launch. These included the following:
â¢ More resources and effort to be allocated to the
advertising and promotion effort for the new
product.
â¢ A clearer definition of marketing objectives.
â¢ Better in-house coordination among the sales, advertising, service, and production departments.

Table 11. Precommercialization Business Analysis

Methods
1. A detailed financial analysis, involving a
return or profitability assessment.
2. A review/integration of marketing
information only: sales forecasts and
marketing cost projections.
3. A cost review: a review of distribution,
production and marketing costs.

â¢ Better training and preparation of the sales force.

"Shaded bars show significant differences between successful and unsuccessful products. Signif. indicates
level of significance, based on two-tail t-test.

But the question remains, how important are each of
these activities? And to what extent does new product
success hinge on carrying out specific activities well?
Exhibits 5, 6, and 7 provide these answers.
The completeness of the new product process-whether an activity was carried out or not--is strongly
linked to project outcomes. Exhibit 5 shows the frequency of activities for successful projects versus unsuccessful ones. For certain activities, there were significant differences.
Preliminary market assessment and the formal
market launch stage were much more prevalent in
successful projects than in the failures. These two
activities showed the most significant differences
between successes and failures.
Some activities, such as test markets and the detailed market study, were done so infrequently
that no meaningful differences between successes
and failures could be detected.

Whether or not an activity was part of the new
product process was significantly related to project outcomes for 9 of the 13 activities. Successful projects consistently featured a higher frequency of these nine activities (see Exhibit 5).
Finally, when one looks at the completeness of the
new product process (i.e., how many activities were
carried out), successful projects featured significantly
more activities--a much more complete process-than did failures (two-tail t-test, 0.003 level). A more
detailed analysis revealed that only 38.2% of all failure
projects featured nine or more activities. In contrast,
54.8% of successes had nine or more activities. Further, nearly one quarter (23.6%) of all failures had five
or less activities completed compared to only 4.8% of
successes. (These latter differences were significant at
the 0.003 level, Chi-square test.) In short, a more complete new product process appears to make a difference.
How proficiently these activities were undertaken

was also strongly tied to project outcomes. Exhibit 6
shows the mean proficiency ratings for successful versus unsuccessful products; following are some highlights:
Three of the activities were strongly related to
project outcomes. That is, in successful projects,
the activity tended to be significantly more proficiently undertaken. These three activites were
-initial screening;
-preliminary technical assessment;
- - product development.
Another six activities were also significantly related to project outcomes: The activity was much
better handled in successful projects. These six
activities were
-preliminary market assessment;
-market research/detailed market study;
-business/financial analysis;

----

in-house product tests;
test market/trial sell;
market launch.

Although causality cannot be demonstrated here, there
appears to be a strong link between project outcomes
(success or failure) and doing certain activities and
doing them well.
How consistent are these relationships between project outcomes and activities? Success and failure can be
measured in a number of ways, and the particular measure used might affect the outcome-activity link. In
order to check the applicability of the results, four different measures of new product performance were
considered:
. An overall project profitability rating on a 0 to 10
scale (from "fell far short of our minimum acceptable profitability level" to "far exceeded our minimum acceptable profitability level").

"Signs of correlations with paybacks were all negative (not shown): the more proficient the activity, the shorter the paybaek period.
t'When undertaken, the proficiency of screening was positively correlated (r - 0.41) with the rated success of the project.

2. The payback period of the project (measured in
years).
3. The domestic market share.
4. The foreign market share (averaged over the principal target market countries).
The proficiency rating of each activity was then related to each of these four measures of success (Pearson
correlation coefficients; see Exhibit 7); following are
some highlights:
How well certain activities were undertaken and
new product performance was strongly and positively related, regardless of the gauge of performance used.
Certain activities stood out as particularly key,
however. These were
-initial screening;
- - preliminary market assessment;
- - detailed market study/market research;
-business/financial analysis;
- - product development;
i
in-house product tests;
- - market launch.

Many of these are up front or predevelopment
activities.

â¢ Only the proficiencies of precommercial business
analysis and customer tests of the product were
uncorrelated with project outcomes (although the
frequency of both activities indeed was linked to
outcomes [see Exhibit 5]).
Profitability measures--overall profitability and
the payback period--appeared more directly explained by the new product process activities than
were the market share measures.
Finally, the completeness of the new product process was also significantly tied to several of these measures of success. More successful projects--based on
the overall success rating and the payback period-clearly featured a more complete process, that is, a
larger number of process activities (Anova's with Duncan multiple range tests).
Before moving into a discussion of the implications
of the study, the reader should be aware of the limitations of the research. First, the population of firms
studied was in Canada. All firms were industrial product manufacturers known to be active in the field of
product development. Although many of the firms
were multinational (U.S. or European), one cannot directly generalize the results to other countries. Second,
because not all firms in the original sample agreed to
participate, the final sample of 123 firms is not totally

<-----Page 13----->84

J PRODINNOVMANAG
1986;3:71 85

representative; however, a response rate of 62% is certainly respectable and suggests a fairly relevant sample.
Questions of data reliability and validity are also an
issue. Special care was taken to ensure that the appropriate person in each firm was interviewed; in many
cases, two or three managers sat in on the interview.
The questionnaire itself had been pretested. Finally,
there was no evidence of managers deliberately concealing, biasing, or falsifying answers: managers cooperated fully and appeared to respond to the questions to
the best of their abilities.

Summary and Implications

This research has provided a glimpse into what happens
during the new product process and into how decisive
the activities that make up process are in determining
project outcomes. The overriding finding of the investigation is that new product success is closely linked to
what activities are carried out in the new product process, how well they are executed, and the completeness
of the process. That is, people--and not solely the
nature of the market, the type of technology, or even
the synergy or fit between the project and the f i r m - doing tasks and, most importantly, people doing them
well contribute strongly to new product success. Markets, technology, synergy, and other factors all enter
the success equation, as other studies have found [57,11,14-16]; however, the outcomes of the new product project are also very much in the hands of the men
and women who move the project from idea to launch.
A second general conclusion is that the new product
process is deficient in many companies. Although
many managers profess to have a systematic process
plan in place, an audit of what actually happens "in the
trenches" reveals many gaps and deficiencies. A
number of activities, often critical activities, are omitted altogether, and other key activities are superficially
or weakly undertaken.
The most glaring deficiencies--activities that were
often overlooked or weakly handled, yet were strongly
linked to product success--appear in Table 13.
There are a number of action implications from the
results of the investigation:

1. A new product process model. The critical nature of
the majority of the activities of the process, corn-

Comment
Omitted altogether in 74.6%
of the projects; rated weakly when done, yet significantly correlated with all
four measures of project
performance.
Very weakly undertaken, particularly in failure projects;
strongly correlated with all
four measures of project
performance.
Omitted in 23.3% of the projects; very weakly rated
overall, yet strongly correlated with all four measures
of project performance.

bined with the major gaps and deficiencies uncovered, point strongly to the need for a standard
activity p l a n - - a new product process model. Such a
flow model charts the activities that should or must
be undertaken as a new product project moves from
the idea stage to launch. Although such a model will
be tailored to the needs of each firm and project, a
good place to begin is with the list of activities
described in this study (see, e.g., Cooper [3]) By
having such a model, or "blueprint for action," in
place, the hope is that there will be fewer instances
where critical activities are omitted or where insufficient time and resources are allocated to particular
activities [3]. Although the addition of activities is
clearly no guarantee of success, the omission of
steps should be made by conscious decision, not by
oversight.
. A need for discipline. Having a process model in
place is only half the battle. Adhering to the model
in a disciplined fashion is the second half. Even in
those firms that claimed to have a system or model
in place, the comment was often made, " W e do
many of the (desirable) activities in most of our
projects; what we lack is consistency." The appropriate activity or process model, once designed,
must be adhered to. For example, there are good and
valid reasons why virtually every new product process model features a formal screening stage, a detailed market study, and a test market or trial sell
step. Arbitrarily deciding to omit key steps--breaking discipline--can spell disaster, as many of the
firms in this study discovered.

<-----Page 14----->AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE NEW PRODUCT PROCESS

. More time, effort, and resources. One of the recurring themes that emerged from the study was that
more time, money, and manpower should be allocated to certain activities in the new product process. What is the point of implementing a process
model if there aren't the resources required to carry
out the activities that comprise the model! To make
such a process model work, there must be commitmerit--not just in words, but in terms of resources.
The standard rebuttal is, " W e can't afford it." Our
response is, "Given the importance of new products, the amounts at stake, and the high likelihood
of failure, you can't afford not to commit the resources to these critical activities."
. More focus on certain key activities. Certain activities were singled out as particularly weak ones
yet were strongly associated with success. These
activities must be built into the new product process. And special attention must be paid these activities to ensure that they are carried out well.
These flagged activities include
market studies: to determine market size; competitive situation; customer needs, wants, and
preferences; and customer reaction to the proposed product or product concept.
initial screening: a formal go/no go decision
point very early in the new product process, involving multidisciplinary, multifunctional inputs
and preferrably based on a written checklist of
criteria.
preliminary market assessment: an early and relatively simple, nonscientific market appraisal,
checking out the market validity of the proposed
product.

program, there is certainly ample justification for directing more attention to the way we conceive, develop, and commercialize new products. This investigation has focused on the activities that comprise the new
product process. By shedding light on the strengths and
weaknesses of the process, the hope is that managers
will become better atuned to the need to implement a
disciplined new product process, backed by the needed
resources to carry out the key activities.
