Abstract

Strategic alliances can be
effective ways to diffuse new
technologies rapidly, to enter a
new market, to bypass
governmental restrictions
expeditiously, and to learn quickly
from the leading firms in a given
field. However, strategic alliances
are not simple or easy to create,
develop, and support. Strategic
alliances projects often fail
because of tactical errors made by
management. By using a well
managed strategic alliances
agreement, companies can gain in
markets that would otherwise be
uneconomical. Considerable time
and energy must be put forth by all
involved in order to create a
successful alliance. It is essential
that corporations enter into
strategic alliances arrangements
with a comprehensive plan
outlining detailed expectations,
requirements, and expected
benefits.

Introduction
Nike, the largest producer of athletic footwear in the world, does not manufacture a
single shoe. Gallo, the largest wine company
on earth, does not grow a single grape.
Boeing, the pre-eminent aircraft
manufacturer, makes little more than
cockpits and wing bits (Quinn, 1995, p. 1).

``How can this be?'' you ask. These
companies, like many other companies these
days, have entered into strategic alliances
with their suppliers to do much of their
actual production and manufacturing for
them.
A strategic alliance is ``an agreement
between firms to do business together in
ways that go beyond normal company-tocompany dealings, but fall short of a merger
or a full partnership'' (Wheelen and Hungar,
2000, p. 125). These alliances range from
informal ``handshake'' agreements to formal
agreements with lengthy contracts in which
the parties may also exchange equity, or
contribute capital to form a joint venture
corporation.
Much of the discussion regarding strategic
alliances has typically focused on alliances
between two companies; however, there is an
increasing trend towards multi-company
alliances. As an example, a six-company
strategic alliance was formed between Apple,
Sony, Motorola, Philips, AT&T and
Matsushita to form General Magic
Corporation to develop Telescript
communications software (Jacobini and
McCreary, 1994).

Strategic alliances are becoming more and
more prominent in the global economy.

Peter Drucker, who has been called the
father of management theory, states: ``The
greatest change in corporate culture, and
the way business is being conducted, may
be the accelerating growth of relationships
based not on ownership, but on
partnership'' (Drucker, 1996). Indeed,
searches on the Internet for strategic
alliances produce numerous press releases
about companies forming alliances, and
also produce several addresses for strategic
alliance consulting companies. The number
of strategic alliances has almost doubled in
the past ten years and is expected to
increase even more in the future (Booz,
Allen and Hamilton, 1997). ``More than
20,000 corporate alliances have been formed
worldwide over the past two years, and . . .
the number of alliances in the USA has
grown by 25 percent each year since 1987''
(Farris, 1999). A survey published in
Electronic Business showed that 80 percent
of electronics companies have strategic
alliances and most are planning or
negotiating additional agreements (Vyas
et al., 1995). According to a recently
released study conducted by Anderson
Consulting, ``82 percent of executives
believe that alliances will be a prime
vehicle for future growth'' (Kalmbach and
Roussel, 1999). The study also predicts that
within five years, strategic alliances will
account for
16-25 percent of medium company value and
40 percent of the market value for about a
quarter of the companies. This means that
in five years, alliances will represent $25$40 trillion in value (Kalmbach and Roussel,
1999).
Strategic alliances are partnerships of
two or more corporations or business units
that work together to achieve strategically
significant objectives that are mutually
beneficial. The potential of strategic
alliances strategy is enormous. If
implemented correctly, some authors claim

it can dramatically improve an
organization's operations and
competitiveness (Brucellaria, 1997, p. 1998).
According to a survey conducted by
Coopers & Lybrand, 54 percent of firms that
formed alliances did so for joint marketing
and promotional purposes (Coopers and
Lybrand, 1997). Companies are forming
alliances to obtain technology, to gain
access to specific markets, to reduce
financial risk, to reduce political risk, to
achieve or ensure competitive advantage
(Wheelen and Hungar, 2000). However,
while many organizations often rush to
jump on the bandwagon of strategic
alliances, few succeed (Soursac, 1996;
Malott, 1992; Michelet and Remacle, 1992).
The failure rate of strategic alliances
strategy is projected to be as high as 70
percent (Kalmbach and Roussel, 1999), and
this failure rate is beginning to be
discussed in leading business periodicals.
This study explores why and how
companies are forming strategic alliances,
examines risks and problems associated
with entering and maintaining successful
strategic alliance and identifies factors that
may impact the success of strategic
alliances in an increasingly competitive
marketplace. Important implications for
the successful introduction and
implementation of strategic alliances are
also discussed.

Reasons for creating strategic
alliances
Growth strategies and entering new
markets

The Coopers & Lybrand study rates growth
strategies and entering new markets among
the top reasons for forming strategic
alliances (Coopers and Lybrand, 1997). As
Ohmae (1992) points out: ``(companies) simply
do not have the time to establish new
markets one-by one''. In today's fast-paced
world economy, this is increasingly true.
Therefore, forming an alliance with an
existing company already in that
marketplace is a very appealing alternative.
Partnering with an international company
can make the expansion into unfamiliar
territory a lot easier and less stressful for a
company. Anhueser-Busch licensed its right
to brew and market Budweiser to other
brewers such as Labatt in Canada, Modelo in
Mexico, and Kirin in Japan, rather than buy
a foreign company or build breweries of its
own in other countries (Wheelen and
Hungar, 2000). ``According to the Coopers &

[ 206 ]

Lybrand (1997) study, 50 percent of firms
involved in alliances market their goods and
services internationally versus
30 percent of nonallied participants.''

Obtain new technology and/or best quality
or cheapest cost
Not all companies can provide the technology
that they need to effectively compete in their
markets on their own. Therefore, they are
teaming up with other companies who do
have the resources to provide the technology
or who can pool their resources so that
together they can provide the needed
technology. Both sides receive benefit from
the partnership. Technology transfer is not
only viewed as being significant to the
success of a strategic alliance, according to
Hsieh (1997): ``host countries now demand
more in the way of technology transfer''. As
evidence of this growing trend, Hsieh cites
China as a prime example:
China . . . increasingly requires access to
proprietary technology in return for
business, leaving companies such as GM and
McDonnell Douglas wondering whether the
technology transfers they made to clinch
deals will come back to haunt them. Some
day, they know, the Chinese will have
technology and skills to compete with them
not only in China but in other markets too
(Hsieh, 1997).

Quinn (1995), Professor Emeritus at
Dartmouth University offers another reason
for forming alliances. He asks companies to
ask themselves: ``Do you really think that
your accounting (or other) department is the
best in the world?'' If the companies answer
``no'' then he asks, ``Why is it still in-house
then?'' Thus, another reason for forming
strategic alliances is to outsource business
functions, which can include, marketing,
production, accounting, sales, or virtually
any other process, to a company which can
do it better and cheaper. Indeed, many
companies are forming alliances looking for
the best quality or technology, or the
cheapest labor or production costs (Quinn,
1995). For example, BP Amoco PLC has
recently decided to outsource its accounting
function to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(PWC). In this situation, Amoco will gain
more efficient accounting work while PWC
will gain some 1,200 employees (Liesman,
1999).

Reduce financial risk and share costs of
research and development

Some companies may find that the financial
risk that is involved in pursuing a new
product or production method is too great

<-----Page 2----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala
An overview of strategic
alliances

for a single company to undertake. In such
cases, two or more companies come
together and agree to spread the risk among
all of them. One example of this is found in
strategic alliance between Boeing,
Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace,
Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, and
Deutsche Aerospace of Germany. These
airplane manufacturers created an alliance
to spread out the extremely high costs of
developing a new large jet airplane
(Wheelen and Hungar, 2000; Das and Teng,
1999).
Many not-for-profit organizations are
limited in resources and skills. Therefore,
they find that strategic alliances are an
excellent way to better serve their clients.
They can form partnerships with others
who also need help and provide what is
needed for all. For example, four
universities in Ohio created a strategic
alliance to develop a school of international
business that would benefit all of their
students (Wheelen and Hungar, 2000, p. 314).

Achieve or ensure competitive advantage

``Alliances are particularly alluring to small
businesses because they provide the tools
businesses need to be competitive'' (Page,
1998). For many small companies the only
way they can stay competitive and even
survive in today's technologically advanced,
ever-changing business world is to form an
alliance with another company or
companies.
Small companies ``realize the mutual
benefits they can derive from strategic
alliances in areas such as marketing,
distribution, production, research and
development, and outsourcing'' (Page, 1998).
LI/Saltzman Architects PC is a small
company specializing in historic
restoration, out of New York, composed of
just six full-time architects. The firm
manages to compete against firms much
larger than them by creating teams with
other companies, both large and small, on a
project-by-project basis (Bernstein, 1999). A
more recent and well-known company that
may no longer be able to stay independent
and have to form a global alliance in order
to compete in the big league of global
aviation is Swissair. By forming alliances
with other companies, small businesses are
able to accomplish bigger projects more
quickly and profitably, than if they tried to
do it on their own. ``We believe that the
world has entered a new age ± an age of
collaboration ± and that only through
allying can companies obtain the
capabilities and resources necessary to win

in the changing global marketplace. Selfreliance is an option few companies will be
able to afford'' (Booz, Allena nd Hamilton,
1997).

Types or forms of strategic alliances

In a study by Coopers and Lybrand (1997),
they identified the following types of
alliances, and found their clients were
engaged in them as follows:
.
joint marketing/promotion, 54 percent;
.
joint selling or distribution, 42 percent;
.
production, 26 percent;
.
design collaboration, 23 percent;
.
technology licensing, 22 percent;
.
research and development contracts,
19 percent;
.
other outsourcing purposes, 19 percent.
Technology Associates and Alliances (1999), a
strategic alliance consulting company, lists
the following types of alliances:
1 Marketing and sales alliances:
.
joint marketing agreements;
.
value added resellers.
2 Product and manufacturing alliances;
.
procurement-supplier alliances;
.
joint manufacturing.
3 Technology and know-how alliances:
.
technology development;
.
university/industry joint research.
Technology Associates and Alliances (1999),
suggests that alliances can be hybrids
between these different types. For example,
an R&D alliance may be a cross between a
product and manufacturing alliance and a
technology and know-how alliance, and a
collaborative marketing agreement is a cross
between a marketing and sales alliance and a
product and manufacturing alliance. The
important thing to remember is that there
are various types of alliances, and they may
range from simple licensing arrangement,
ad hoc alliance, joint operations, joint
venture, consortia, distribution, and valuechain partnership alliances to more complex
hybrid alliances.

The risks and problems facing
strategic alliances
The trend toward strategic alliances in
business has not brought about the results
envisioned by the participants in many
cases. Most studies tend to focus more on the
determinants of their success rather than for
the reasons they fail. It is the risks and
problems that need to be analyzed more fully
to determine the true reasons why over

60 percent of strategic alliances fail
(Kalmbach and Roussel, 1999).

understanding, and despondent
relationships (Lewis, 1992, p 46).

Clash of cultures and ``incompatible
personal chemistry''

Lack of clear goals and objectives

Cultural clash is probably one of the biggest
problems that corporations in alliances face
today. ``These cultural problems consist of
language, egos, chauvinism, and different
attitudes to business can all make the going
rough. Problems can be particularly acute
between a publicly quoted Western holding
company, keenly focused on share holders
value, and Japanese partners who have
different priorities'' (Kilburn, 1999,
p. 22). The first thing that can cause problems
is the language barrier that they might face.
It is important for the companies that are
working together to be able to communicate
and understand each other well or they are
doomed before they even start. After the
communication is worked out the firms now
face the problems they have with operations.
Different cultures operate in different ways
``for example, US companies tend to evaluate
performance on the basis of profit, market
share, and specific financial benefits.
Japanese companies tend to evaluate
primarily on how an operation helps build its
strategic position, particularly by improving
its skills'' (Daniels and Radebaugh, 2001).
From a different perspective, Steensma
et al. (2000) indicated that national cultural
traits directly influence strategic alliance
formation and moderate the relationship
between perceived technological uncertainty
and alliance formation.

Lack of trust

Risk sharing is the primary bonding tool in
a partnership. What will happen if one
company is successful and the other
experiences a failure? A sense of
commitment must be generated throughout
the partnership. In many alliance cases one
company will point the failure finger at the
partnering company. Shifting the blame
does not solve the problem, but increases
the tension between the partnering
companies and often leads to alliance ruin
(Lewis, 1992).
Building trust is the most important and
yet most difficult aspect of a successful
alliance. Only people can trust each other,
not the company. Therefore, alliances need
to be formed to enhance trust between
individuals. The companies must form the
three forms of trust, which include
responsibility, equality, and reliability.
Many alliances have failed due to the lack
of trust causing unsolved problems, lack of

[ 208 ]

In today's business world, many strategic
alliances are formed for the wrong reasons.
This will surely lead to disaster in the future.
Many companies enter into alliances to
combat industry competitors. Corporate
management feels this type of action will
deter competitors from focusing on their
company. On the contrary, this action will
raise flags that problems exist within the
joining companies. The alliance may put the
companies in the spotlight causing more
competition. Alliances are also formed to
correct internal company problems. Once
again, management feels that an increase in
numbers signifies a quick fix. In this case,
the company is probably already doomed and
is just taking another along for the ride
(Kilburn, 1999).
Many strategic alliances, although entered
into for all the right reasons, do not work.
Dissimilar objectives, inability to share
risks, and lack of trust lead to an early
alliance demise. Why do the alliances fail?
Cooperation on all issues is the key to a
successful alliance. Many managers enter
into an alliance without properly
researching the steps necessary to ensure the
basic principles of cooperation (Lewis, 1992).

Lack of coordination between
management teams

Action taken by subordinates that are not
congruent with top-level management can
prove particularly disruptive, especially in
instances where companies remain
competitors in spite of their strategic
alliance. If it were to happen that one
company would go off on its own and do its
own marketing and sell its own product
while in alliance with another company it
would for sure be grounds for the two to
break up, and they would most likely end up
in a legal battle which could take years to
solve if it were settled at all. An example of
this would be ``Volvo's attempt to merge with
Renault in 1993 temporarily destroying
shareholders wealth in Volvo'' (Bruner, 1999).

Differences in operating procedures and
attitudes among partners

Other problems that can occur between
companies in trade alliances are different
attitudes among the companies, one company
may deliver its good or service behind
schedule, or do a bad job producing their
goods or service which may lead to distrust
among the two companies. When problems

<-----Page 4----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala
An overview of strategic
alliances
Management Decision
39/3 [2001] 205±217

like this occur it usually makes the other
company angry, and this could lead to a
takeover. An example of this is described
below:

The deal between Publicis Communication
and Foote, Cone and Belding (FCB) was
designed to fill strategic needs of each: An
alliance in Europe would finally give FCB the
international reach it needed, while Publicis
could use FCB's experience in North and
South America to serve its multinational
clients. The venture officially ended earlier,
after bitter and expensive divorce
proceedings. True North Communications
Inc., the holding company for Foote Cone, and
the world's No. 8 agency group, is fighting off
a $28-a-share hostile takeover attempt by its
ex-partner Publicis, which still owns
18.5 percent (Melcher and Edmundson, 1997).

Relational risk

Relational risk is concerned with the
probability that partner firms lack
commitment to the alliance and that their
possible opportunistic behavior could
undermine the prospects of an alliance.
Consider the example of the joint venture
formed by Liz Claiborne and Avon (Segil,
1997). After Avon acquired Parfums Stern, a
high-end cosmetics firm, Liz Claiborne
regarded Avon as a direct competitor, and
their relationship began to deteriorate. The
joint venture was eventually acquired by Liz
Claiborne. As this case shows, partner firms
± not surprisingly ± tend to be interested
more in pursuing their self-interest than the
common interest of the alliance. Such
opportunistic behaviors include shirking,
appropriating the partner's resources,
distorting information, harboring hidden
agendas, and delivering unsatisfactory
products and services (Das and Teng, 1999).
Because these activities seriously jeopardize
the viability of an alliance, relational risk is
an important component of the overall risk
in strategic alliances.

Performance risk

Performance risk is the probability that an
alliance may fail even when partner firms
commit themselves fully to the alliance. The
sources of performance risk according to a
recent study by Das and Teng (1999) include
environmental factors, such as government
policy changes, war, and economic
recession; market factors, such as fierce
competition and demand fluctuations; and
internal factors, such as a lack of
competence in critical areas, or sheer
bad luck.

Strategic alliances might create a future
local or even global competitor

One partner, for example, might be using the
alliance to test a market and prepare the
launch of a wholly owned subsidiary. By
declining to cooperate with others in the area
of its core competency, a company can reduce
the likelihood of creating a competitor that
would threaten its main area of business;
likewise, a company can insist on contractual
clauses that constrain partners from
competing against it in certain products or
geographic regions (Wild et al., 2000).
The following case shows the problems and
risks associated with global alliances:
The dangers of global alliances are evident in
the case study of Anamartic, a UK
semiconductor firm with a novel technology.
Anamartic undertook a strategy of global
alliance with a major foreign customer and
supplier-manufacturer in order to access
resources and achieve flexibility. Instead, the
new venture found itself locked into a
trajectory shaped by the needs of powerful
corporate partners. The Japanese partner
acquired technological competence and
effective control over the intellectual
property of the venture. The coupling from
research and development and from
production can create serious difficulties for
the protection of intellectual property and the
realization of its potential value (Garnsey and
Wilkinson, 1994, p. 138).

Other problems in strategic alliances

Several reasons are also given for the under
performance and failure of strategic
alliances. The reasons include a breakdown
in trust, a change in strategy, the champions
moved on, the value did not materialize, the
cultures did not mesh, and the systems were
not integrated (Kalmbach and Roussel, 1999).
According to a study conducted by the
Financial Times (1999), the main reason
strategic alliances fail to meet expectations is
``the failure to grasp and articulate their
strategic intent''. This includes the failure to
investigate alternatives to an alliance. The
second reason the Financial Times found for
strategic alliance failure is the ``lack of
recognition of the close interplay between the
overall strategy of the company and the role
of an alliance in that strategy''.

Success factors for strategic
alliances
The scholars who study strategic alliances and
the consultants who help form them have both
addressed the question ``What does it take for
strategic alliances to succeed?'' Perhaps the
best answers to this question are provided by

[ 209 ]

<-----Page 5----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala

Management Decision

those who engage in alliances. A Technology
Associates and Alliances (1999), survey asked
455 CEO's to rank the importance of certain
success factors for strategic alliances, and the
results of that study are presented in Figure 1.
In addition to these factors, several factors
were identified as critical success factors for
strategic alliances.

Senior management commitment

The commitment of the senior management
of all companies involved in a strategic
alliance is a key factor in the alliance's
ultimate success. Indeed, for alliances to be
truly ``strategic'' they must have a significant
impact on the companies' overall strategic
plans; and must therefore be formulated,
implemented, managed, and monitored with
the full commitment of senior management.
Without senior management's commitment,
alliances will not receive the resources they
need. As Peter Lorange of the University of
Pennsylvania points out: ``very often firms
view strategic alliances as a second-best
option that they would prefer to do without.
Strategic alliances receive attention only
after one's wholly owned business has been
dealt with, often through the assignment of
one's less-than-strongest executives''
(Lorange and Roos, 1991). Thus, if senior
management is not committed to alliances,
adequate managerial resources, in addition
to capital, production, marketing and labor
resources, may not be assigned in order for
alliances to accomplish their objectives.
Senior management's commitment to
alliances is important not only to ensure the
alliances receive the necessary resources,
but also to convince others throughout the
organization of the importance of the
alliance. As Lorange further points out:
``everyone must be `sold' on the concept early
on'' (Lorange et al., 1992). In many companies,
alliances are viewed as outside the
organizational mainstream; and therefore,
employees at all levels may tend to view them

Figure 1

[ 210 ]

as not as important or as worthwhile as the
organization's core business. By
demonstrating a commitment to alliance and
a strong leadership role, management can
minimize this viewpoint.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle senior
management has to overcome in committing
itself to strategic alliances is management's
own fear of a loss of control. In his article
``The global logic of strategic alliances'',
Ohmae (1992) states that ``when Americans
and Europeans come to Japan, they all want
51 percent. That's the magic number because
it ensures majority position and control over
personnel, brand decisions, and investment
choices. But good partnerships, like good
marriages, don't work on the basis of
ownership or control. It takes effort and
commitment and enthusiasm from both sides
if either is to realize the hoped-for benefits''
(Ohmae, 1992). He argues that by requiring
such a stake in an alliance, the Americans
and Europeans are demonstrating a lack of
commitment to devoting the time and energy
to establish the business relationship and
partnership, and perhaps more importantly
are demonstrating a lack of trust. He states
that such managers often think ``that
alliances represent, at best, a convenience, a
quick-and-dirty means of entry into foreign
markets'' (Ohmae, 1992).
Xerox is an example of a company which
has demonstrated a high level of senior
management commitment to strategic
alliances. Xerox even has executives with
titles such as senior vice president, corporate
strategic alliances and vice president,
worldwide alliances (Ernst and Stern, 1996).
In addition, Great Central Company CEO,
Beasley, also demonstrates the right attitude
for senior management to have regarding
alliances when he states: ``There is active
co-operation between parties, where two plus
two equals four and a quarter. Everybody
gains'' (Coopers and Lybrand, 1997).

Similarity of management philosophies

Corning, Inc. is a leader in forming
successful strategic alliances with a simple
approach to evaluating potential partners:
``[We] go and sniff their hindquarters and see
if they smell like us'' (Booth, 1995). While this
quote may seem somewhat vulgar or
disgusting, it really is a very simple way of
stating that they prefer to form partnerships
with those companies whose management
philosophies, strategies and ideas are most
similar to their own. Indeed, differences in
corporate partners' personalities, like
differences in spousal personalities, can often
lead to tragic results.

Perhaps this is best illustrated by
reviewing the turbulent (pun intended)
strategic alliance of KLM and Northwest
Airlines. The relationship between these two
companies has been described by KLM
President Pieter Bouw as ``a classic clash in
cultures, a collision of two diametrically
opposed philosophies of doing business. It's
the European way versus the American way''
(Tully, 1996). The European way of KLM is
based on the belief that investments should
be prudent and long-term, and the risks of
high leverage should be avoided. In contrast,
the US way of Northwest is based on the
belief that sharp deal-making, including
leveraged buy-outs, spin-offs, or debtfinancing can dramatically boost stock prices
and work well with a sound operating
strategy. The differences were so strong in
the case of KLM and Northwest that the
senior management of the two organizations
fought constantly, eventually ceased
virtually all communications, and began a
costly battle for control of the alliance. The
philosophical differences of KLM and
Northwest were, in part due to cultural
differences, so there is significant potential
for other cross-border alliances to include
such widespread differences in managerial
philosophies as well. Therefore, in order to
ensure the best chance of success, companies
should either seek partners who do have
similar management philosophies, or draft
an alliance agreement that adequately
addresses the differences, and provides for
their resolution (Ernst and Stern, 1996).

Effective and strong management team

A McKinsey study found that 50 percent of
alliance failures are due to poor
management. Chuck Knight, the CEO of
Emerson Electric agreed that poor
management is often the downfall of
alliances, stating: ``I do not believe that
(alliances) fail in the planning stage. They
fail in implementation ± that is the graveyard
of corporate America'' (Ernst and Stern,
1996). In their article, ``Managing alliances ±
skills for the modern era,'' Ernst and Stern
(1996) suggest ``as alliance complexity rises
and experienced human resources and pulled
ever-thinner, the challenges . . . become more
acute.'' Therefore, the best strategy to grow
via alliances may be to move slowly, and
start with simple alliances and the move
towards more complex ones as alliance
experience and talent is acquired.
In his article, ``Strategic alliances: when
you don't want to go it alone,'' Gimba (1996)
states managers of strategic alliances ``must
create and maintain an environment of

trust.'' This is perhaps easier said than done.
It requires the surrender of at least some
managerial control, and it also takes time to
build a high degree of trust in a business
partnership.
Hewlett-Packard and Lotus are
corporations which have been cited as
having strong alliance management. HewlettPackard's approach to alliances is very
formal, well-organized and structured.
Hewlett-Packard has developed a 400-page
alliance binder with case histories, tool kits,
checklists, policies, and procedures to help
not only its alliance managers, but its middle
managers as well, to more appropriately
manage alliances and alliance relationships.
Hewlett-Packard also has developed its own
two-day strategic alliance training class,
which over 700 of its managers have attended
to date. Lotus likewise has a strong
management team for its alliances.
A 40-person alliance group manages the
company's alliances, and they have
developed three dozen alliance rules of
thumb to guide their strategic alliance
formation, implementation, and management
(Ernst and Stern, 1996).

Frequent performance feedback

In order for strategic alliances to succeed,
their performance must be continually
assessed and evaluated against the short and
long-term goals and objectives for the
alliance. Hewlett-Packard business
development manager, Bryon Look states
that: ``after each alliance is formed, we hold a
postmortem with all the involved (HP)
parties. We look at the original objectives,
the implementation, what went right and
what went wrong'' (Ernst and Stern, 1996).
The results of these reviews are summarized
in briefing reports which are distributed to
management and also keyed into a strategic
alliance tracking data base. In addition,
Hewlett-Packard's business development
group continues to review existing alliances
and evaluate their progress.
Alliance Management International, Ltd
(1999), is a consulting firm which specializes
in advising its clients on the formation and
management of strategic alliances. One of the
services AMI also provides its clients is an
evaluation of their existing alliances. To do
this, AMI uses a survey which asks their
clients to answer the following questions on a
scale from strongly agree to strongly
disagree:
.
Our gains from the alliance are mutual.
.
The value of the alliance is apparent to
our customers.

This alliance offers a competitive
advantage (best in class).
The driving forces of the companies are
complementary.
The operations, risks, and rewards are
balanced.
As alliance partners we always explore
new opportunities together.
The objectives are clearly defined.
There is an excellent clarity of purpose.
The roles of each partner are clearly
understood.
The alliance has a shared vision.
We develop shared goals that are
measurable.
Both companies have the same mind
share.
Top executives from both companies have
met and support the goals of the alliance.
We have excellent channels of
communication at all levels.
Key issues are raised early and acted on
promptly.
We have a high degree of trust.
There is continuity in the players.
There is commitment and support at all
levels.

In order for the feedback monitoring system
to be successful, it is important that the goals
of the alliance be well-defined and
measurable. In addition, benchmarks for
alliance performance should be set to assist
management in evaluating alliance results.
In general, an alliance is successful if both
partners achieve their objectives (Michelet
and Remacle, 1992), or by its long-term
strategic value (Lynch, 1990). However,
according to a recent study by Andersen
Consulting, strategic alliances can be more
specifically measured by ``developing a
balanced scorecard, building a dollar
defense, and accounting for surplus value''
(Kalmbach and Roussel, 1999). A few
financial measures are also evaluated which
may include ``sales market share, return on
investment, new product creation, name
recognition, and shelf space'' (Michelet and
Remacle, 1992). Rewarding individuals based
on the performance measures of the alliance
will motivate them to ``strive for excellence''
according to a recent study by Kalmbach and
Roussel (1999).
Another measurement technique for
strategic alliances is looking at the market
share. Synergistic contribution towards parent
companies competitiveness. Strategic alliances
are very tough to measure and evaluate, but
can be done with the help of understanding the
form used and understanding the goals of the
companies involved. ``It is hypothesized that

[ 212 ]

more successful strategic alliances will be
characterized by high levels of commitment,
interdependence and trust, communication
quality, and information sharing than less
successful ones, not just between strategic
alliances partners but also between strategic
alliances and client'' (O'Farrell and Wood,
1999).

Clearly defined, shared goals and
objectives

In forming a strategic alliance the question
must be asked: ``How integrated will the
alliance be with the parent organizations?''
Some alliances are highly integrated with
one or more of the parent organizations and
share such resources as manufacturing
facilities, management staff, and support
functions like payroll, purchasing, and
research and development. Conversely,
others may be autonomous and independent
from their parent organizations. Whatever
the relationship between the two partners,
the merging of separate corporate cultures in
which the parent firms may have different,
even ultimately conflicting, strategic intents
can be difficult and anything but smooth. It is
extremely important that alliances are
aligned with the company strategy. Top
management must articulate a clear link
between where it expects the industry's
future profit pools will be, how to capture a
larger share of those, and where, if at all,
alliances fit in that plan (Ernst and Stern,
1996).
One example of an industry, which in
recent years has seen many obstacles and
bitter confrontation, is the airline industry.
At a travel convention Simon Heale, deputy
managing director, commercial, Cathay
Pacific Airways, said that alliances will not
be advantageous if the partners do not have a
clear focus on the goals. He also mentioned
that an airline may not be able to keep
standards consistent when it has a franchise
alliance. Consumers will associate the small
franchisee with the international airline and
expect the same standards (Chen, 1999).
When these standards are not delivered this
leads to negative repercussions for the brand.
It has been increasingly difficult to form a
successful alliance in the airline industry.
Some of the reasons for failure often
emphasize matters such as ``lack of trust'' and
``incompatible personal chemistry'' (Chen,
1999).
A McKinsey study found that 50 percent of
alliance failures are due to poor strategy
while 50 percent are the result of poor
management (Alliance Management, 1999).
Such sentiments were echoed in a conference

<-----Page 8----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala

alliances
Management Decision

board speech by Chuck Knight, the chief
executive of Emerson Electric:

I do not believe that [alliances] fail in the
planning stage, they fail in implementationÐ
that is the graveyard of corporate America
(Chen, 1999).

As complexity of strategic alliances rises and
human resources are pulled ever-thinner, the
challenges of follow-through will become
more acute.

Thorough planning

Planning, commitment, and agreement are
essential to the success of any relationship.
The overall strategy for the alliance must be
mutually developed. Key managing
individuals and areas of focus for the alliance
must be identified. The steps to successful
joint planning are summarized in Figure 2,
which reads from the bottom-up.
The first step is to gain a clear
understanding of the vision and values of
each company. The next step is to gain
agreement on the market conditions in the
region of the world that the joint venture will
be operating in. The next step is to clearly
state the issues, strengths, and concerns of
each organization. These initial steps allows
the participants to bridge preliminary gaps of
understanding at the onset of the process.
During these initial fact finding meetings the
partners can learn a great deal about their
potential partner(s).
The next step is to identify areas of
common ground. Here is where commonality
in the strategic direction among the partners
can be identified. Next the partners need to
define the internal and external value of the

Figure 2

alliance. They will also need to agree on the
strategic opportunities to mutually pursue.
The final step in this planning process is to
create a tactical plan to address the strategic
targets (Alliance Management, 1999).
Thorough planning is one of the key
ingredients to the successful formation of
strategic alliances.

Clearly understood roles

In forming strategic alliances the partners
must have clearly understood roles.
Questions which must be answered
concerning the role of each partner would
include the following:

Do you share equally in the marketing and
operations management of the alliance with
your partner, or will he run the show? On
what basis is control of the alliance
determined: commitment of manpower?
Cash? (Stewart and Allyson, 1996).

It is crucial that this question of control is
resolved before the alliance is formed. Many
US companies have encountered problems
because the role of management im
marketing and operations was unclear from
the beginning. The amount of control in these
two areas oftentimes depends on manpower
at the foreign location, or cash investment. A
strategic alliance by definition falls short of a
merger or a full partnership. For this reason,
control is not dependent on majority
ownership. The degree to which each partner
is in control of operations and can offer
influential input for decision making must be
determined before the alliance is formed
(Haines, 1997).
Some firms view strategic alliances as a
second-best option that they would prefer to
do without. This attitude towards an alliance
is problematic at best. Because of uncertainty
and discomfort, the feeling is that these
alliances must be closely managed and
controlled so as not to ``get out of hand.'' This
is a counterproductive attitude that often
leads to an unsatisfactory outcome for at
least one partner (Lorange and Roos, 1991).
If the partners in an alliance decide up
front exactly what each partner's role is in
the newly-formed business, then there is no
misunderstanding or uncertainty as to how
decisions will be made. In this way the
relationship between the partners will be a
much more amicable one.

International vision

In order to succeed in an international
strategic alliance, managers of firms must
incorporate a global strategic vision into
their enterprise. This point is reiterated in

[ 213 ]

<-----Page 9----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala
An overview of strategic
alliances
Management Decision
39/3 [2001] 205±217

an article by Ferenc Vissi (1997), who
indicates that:

Global competition has reached the point
where the competition policy in the most
advanced countries and regions . . . is
assuming an increasingly international,
cooperative character. The harmonization
came about precisely because national
competition policy was unable to keep up
with globalization (Vissi, 1997).

Hsieh commented that the ``most effective
alliances are not forged simply as a means to
complete one deal. Smart companies spin a
web of relationships that open a series of
potential projects, add value to them, and
improve risk management'' (Hsieh, 1997). In
order to compete in the growing
international market, it will be increasingly
necessary for firms to cooperate on a global
level and continually build international
relationships which will facilitate the
process of global competition.
One success story cited by Hsieh was that
of Corning, a US firm which entered into a
strategic alliance, known as Sacer, with
Siemens. This alliance enabled a ``small
company like Corning to operate on a scale
similar to that of a large industry contender
such as AT&T. And, contrary to evidence
suggesting that most joint ventures do not
last more than 10 years, this one has been
going on for almost 25'' (Hsieh, 1997).

Partner selection

Partnership selection is perhaps the most
important step in creating a successful
alliance. A successful alliance requires the
joining of two competent firms, seeking a
similar goal and both intent on its success.
The term ``competent firm'' is relative to the
involved parties' strategies, objectives and
goal.
``A strategic alliance must be structured
so that it is the intent of both parties that it
will actually succeed ± through the need for
speed, adaptation, and facilitated evolution.
The foundation of a successful strategic
alliance is laid during the internal
formation process'' (Lorange et al., 1992).
This internal formation process includes
partner selection and the initial agreement
between parties. The process for partner
selection is:
1 state the firm's strategy;
2 develop a partnership benchmark;
3 eliminate undesirable business sectors;
4 select promising business sectors; and
5 select from potential candidates (Lorange
et al., 1991).
Selecting an appropriate partner and
itemizing the ``rules'' of the alliance are the

[ 214 ]

most intensive process in the formation of an
alliance. Yet done correctly, they help ensure
a higher quality, longer lasting relationship.
No business relationship is guaranteed, but
when given enough information, it has a
more solid foundation upon which to build
(see Figure 3).
Having selected a partner, the alliance
should be structured so that the firm's risks
of giving too much away to the partner are
reduced to an acceptable level. Figure 3
depicts the four safeguards against
opportunism by alliance partners that we
discuss here. Opportunism, includes the
``theft'' of technology and/or markets that
Hill (1999) describes. The safeguards are
walling off critical technology, establishing
contractual safeguards, agreeing to swap
valuable skills and technologies, and seeking
credible commitments.
Boeing was strongly criticized for its
alliance with Japan. Many feared that
Boeing was creating a competitor in the
aerospace industry, an industry dominated
by the USA and essential to its economy. To
allay these concerns, Boeing kept its most
valuable techniques concealed. This was
accomplished by preventing Japanese
engineers from observing production
techniques first hand, disallowing them
access to ``Boeing's state of the art wing
design'' or to the computer rooms housing,
``technology that took Boeing over 20 years
to develop. ``Some technology transference
is inevitable, but Boeing has kept it to a
minimum.'' Boeing appears to be the
``winner'' in this alliance because not only
does it have a ``reliable supplier and codesigner and a large and faithful customer,''
it has avoided creating a competitor
(Turnipseed et al., 1999).
US firms profit greatly improved through
strategic alliances with Japanese and
European companies. They experience
reduced product development cost, access
to Japanese and European markets,
domestic competitive advantage, and
increased manufacturing skills. Other
benefits include reduced ``sales, marketing
and support costs, faster progress up the
learning curve, improved relationships
with customers and distributors, and an
enhanced local reputation'' (Michelet and
Remacle, 1992; Burton, 1995).

Communication between partners:
maintaining relationships

As with any relationship, communication is
an essential attribute for the alliance to be
successful. Without effective
communication between partners, the

<-----Page 10----->Dean Elmuti and
Yunus Kathawala
An overview of strategic
alliances
Management Decision
39/3 [2001] 205±217

alliance will inevitably dissolve as a result
of doubt and mistrust which accompany
any relationship which does not manifest
good communication practices. As
previously referenced in this paper, the
strategic alliance between Northwest and
KLM radiated bad blood and mistrust. One
executive summed it up best concerning the
relationship between KLM and Northwest
when he indicated: ``There is definitely a
culture clash. It hurts in my heart to hear
Northwest say the trust is gone'' (Tully,
1996). On the other hand, Corning has a topnotch reputation for using effective
communication to build long-lasting and
profitable relationships. According to
Hsieh (1997), Corning is: ``one of the most
successful companies in the world at
building and maintaining relationships.''
The necessity for good communications in
building and maintaining a strong strategic
alliance relationship is best summed up by
Ohmae:

An alliance is a lot like a marriage. There
may be no formal contract. There is no
buying and selling of equity. There are few,
if any, rigidly binding provisions. It is a
loose evolving kind of relationship. Sure,
there are guidelines and expectations, but
no one expects a precise, measured return
on the initial commitment. Both partners
bring to an alliance a faith that they will be
stronger together than they would be
separately. Both believe that each has
unique skills and functional abilities the
other likes. And both have to work
diligently over time to make the union
successful (Ohmae, 1992).

Conclusions and implications
In a rapidly evolving world of uncertainties
facing the new millennium, and of all the
trends sweeping across the business
landscape, few will have more of an impact

Figure 3

on companies into the next decade than
strategic alliances or partnerships.
Strategic alliances strategy has been
prescribed as an important tool for
attaining and maintaining a competitive
advantage. In addition, strategic alliances
concept is growing in appeal to
organizations because of the cost savings
achieved in executing operations. Indeed,
many companies are forming alliances
looking for the best quality or technology or
the cheapest labor or production costs.
While such relationships can pay off, no
business should form partnerships just
because they are trendy. Companies
sometimes enter into alliances without
thoroughly analyzing their options, only to
realize a merger or acquisition, or even
selling the business, would have been best.
This is a primary reason that many
alliances fail, so it is imperative that
companies make sure that an alliance is the
best option for their needs. Therefore,
companies should be clear about why they
are entering the alliance and what they
expect to gain from it. They also need to
understand how it fits into their business
plan.
It is essential that businesses enter into
strategy alliances arrangements with a
comprehensive plan outlining detailed
expectations, requirements, and expected
benefits. Strategic alliances partners
should be selected based on their expertise
in the operation and their cultural fit with
the firm. Management of the strategic
alliances project should be constant to
ensure that requirements are being met and
potential problems are identified early
enough to be resolved. The firm must create
a management structure that will work
with the new organizational arrangement.
As was reiterated in the context of the
paper, the success factor importance
depends a great deal on the complexity of
the alliance. The success factors presented
in this paper can provide a template for
success in entering and maintaining a
successful international strategic alliance,
especially since firms will need to expand
into the expanding global markets in order
to economically survive. This point is well
reiterated by Ohmae:

. . . the relentless challenges of globalization
will not go away. And properly managed
alliances are among the best mechanism
that companies have found to bring strategy
to bear on these challenges. In today's
uncertain world, it is best not to go alone
(Ohmae, 1992).
