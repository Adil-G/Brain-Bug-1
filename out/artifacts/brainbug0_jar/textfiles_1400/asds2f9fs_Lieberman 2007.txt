Abstract
Social cognitive neuroscience examines social phenomena and processes using cognitive neuroscience research tools such as neuroimaging and neuropsychology. This review examines four broad
areas of research within social cognitive neuroscience: (a) understanding others, (b) understanding oneself, (c) controlling oneself,
and (d ) the processes that occur at the interface of self and others. In
addition, this review highlights two core-processing distinctions that
can be neurocognitively identiﬁed across all of these domains. The
distinction between automatic versus controlled processes has long
been important to social psychological theory and can be dissociated
in the neural regions contributing to social cognition. Alternatively,
the differentiation between internally-focused processes that focus
on one’s own or another’s mental interior and externally-focused
processes that focus on one’s own or another’s visible features and actions is a new distinction. This latter distinction emerges from social
cognitive neuroscience investigations rather than from existing psychological theories demonstrating that social cognitive neuroscience
can both draw on and contribute to social psychological theory.

INTRODUCTION
Social cognitive neuroscience is a burgeoning interdisciplinary ﬁeld combining the tools
of cognitive neuroscience with questions and
theories from various social sciences including
social psychology, economics, and political
science. Although research on the biological
correlates of social processes has been ongoing for decades (Cacioppo & Bernston 1992),
this approach has gone through a period
of rapid expansion with the advent of functional neuroimaging (Adolphs 2003, Ochsner
& Lieberman 2001). Since the time of the ﬁrst
conference on social cognitive neuroscience
(the UCLA Conference on Social Cognitive
Neuroscience, April 2001) until the present,
260

Lieberman

there has been an enormous growth in the
ﬁeld as evidenced by increasing numbers of research articles, edited volumes, and academic
meetings devoted to social cognitive neuroscience. An Internet search using the words
“social cognitive neuroscience” yielded 53 hits
in early 2001, whereas today the same search
yields more than 30,000 hits. Moreover, in the
past year, two new journals have been created
(Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience and
Social Neuroscience) to provide outlets for this
work.
Although selective reviews of social cognitive neuroscience have been written in the
past few years (Blakemore et al. 2004, Ochsner
2004), no comprehensive review has captured
the breadth of the area. Thus, ﬁrst and foremost, this review covers the broad themes and
main ﬁndings across numerous areas of social cognitive neuroscience research. The review is divided into four subsections focusing
on (a) understanding others, (b) understanding oneself, (c) controlling oneself, and (d) the
processes that occur at the interface of self
and others. Unfortunately, space constraints
prevent this review from covering some topics relevant to social cognitive neuroscience,
such as emotion recognition and face processing (see Adolphs 2002, Haxby et al. 2002).
The second goal of this review is to identify core-processing distinctions that may cut
across the different domains of social cognition and provide a framework for organizing general principles of social cognitive neuroscience. Two core-processing distinctions
are examined throughout this review: (a) automatic versus controlled processes and (b)
internally-focused versus externally-focused
processes.
Dual-process models of automatic and
controlled social cognition have been proposed in nearly every domain of social psychology (Chaiken & Trope 1999). Controlled
processes (e.g., rehearsing a nine-digit number) are associated with awareness, intention, effort, and the capacity for interruption
(Wegner & Bargh 1998). In contrast, automatic processes (e.g., “Juliet” spontaneously

one or more of these qualities. Consistent
with the notion that automatic and controlled processes are supported by distinct
systems (Smith & DeCoster 1999), distinct
neurocognitive systems have been hypothesized to support these two forms of social
cognition.
The X-system, named for the “x” in reﬂexive (Lieberman et al. 2002, Satpute &
Lieberman 2006), corresponds roughly to
an automatic social cognition system (see
Table 1). The neural regions associated with
the X-system (see Figure 1) are the amygdala,
basal ganglia, ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(VMPFC), lateral temporal cortex (LTC), and
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).
The C-system, named for the “c” in reﬂective, corresponds roughly to a controlled
social cognition system. The neural regions
associated with the C-system are lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), lateral parietal cortex (LPAC),
medial parietal cortex (MPAC), medial temporal lobe (MTL), and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). For a rationale of each

nomination to the two systems, see Satpute &
Lieberman (2006). The automatic and control distinctions are addressed in each section of this review for which relevant data are
available.
This review also highlights a second coreprocessing distinction between internallyfocused and externally-focused forms of social
cognition. This is not a distinction between
self- and other-focused cognition. Rather,
internally-focused cognition refers to mental
processes that focus on one’s own or another’s
mental interior (e.g., thoughts, feelings, experience), whereas externally-focused cognition
refers to mental processes that focus on one’s
own or another’s physical and visible features
and actions that are perceived through sensory modalities and are experienced as part of
the material world. This distinction emerges
as a data-driven ﬁnding across numerous domains of social cognitive neuroscience rather
than from any existing theories of social cognition. As such, this review hopefully reveals
how social cognitive neuroscience can inform
social psychological theory, in addition to being informed by it.

UNDERSTANDING OTHERS
Although social cognition has come to encompass a broad range of mental processes, in the
strictest sense, social cognition is about understanding other people. In some ways, other
people are like objects that have various physical characteristics, but unlike objects, other
people have minds and experiences that are
not directly open to inspection. There are at
least two ways to try to understand the experience and the mind of another. One of these
ways is addressed by work on “theory of mind”
(Perner & Wimmer 1985). Theory of mind
research examines the ability to propositionally reason from one’s theory of how minds
operate and how social situations affect mental states in general, in order to represent the
mental state of a particular individual given a
particular situation. Thus, our knowledge of
social rules and norms mediates these insights
(Gilbert & Malone 1995). However, there are
also times when our insight feels unmediated,
when it feels like we are seeing the world directly through another person’s eyes and feeling the world through their visceral reactions.
In this case, we feel like we have an insider’s
perspective on what it is like to be that person. The following sections review the neural
bases of these two ways of knowing others.

Representing the Minds of Others
Representing psychological states of others. The ability to represent the contents of
another’s mind consists of two components:
(a) the recognition that, unlike other objects
in the world, people have minds with thoughts
and feelings, and (b) the development of a theory regarding how other people’s minds operate and respond to events in their environment. Research on theory of mind (Perner &
Wimmer 1985) has found that by age four
nearly all children develop the ability to assess the mental states of others. This process may build upon the capacity to recognize biological motion and goal-directed
action that emerges by around six months

of age (Woodward 1998). From childhood
through adulthood, increasingly complex and
domain-speciﬁc theories form (Reeder 1993),
although this increasing sophistication does
not always yield greater accuracy (Gilbert &
Malone 1995).
Neuroimaging studies of theory of mind
have typically shown activations in DMPFC
(BA 8/9), posterior superior temporal sulcus
(pSTS) in LTC, and the temporal poles in
LTC (for review, see Frith & Frith 2003).
Research suggests that pSTS is particularly
sensitive to biological motion (Allison et al.
2000) and that the temporal poles may
be associated with perception of familiar
individuals (Sugiura et al. 2001). Frith &
Frith (2003) suggest that unlike LTC, which
is sensitive to external visual cues, DMPFC
is speciﬁcally associated with mentalizing,
which is overt thought about the internal
mental states of others. Additionally, Saxe
et al. (2004) have suggested that the temporoparietal junction in LPAC is distinct from
nearby pSTS and is also involved in theory of
mind processes. Finally, both neuroimaging
and neuropsychological investigations have
suggested that right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (VLPFC), a subregion within LPFC,
helps to inhibit one’s own experience during
the consideration of another’s state of mind
(Samson et al. 2005, Vogeley et al. 2001).
These ﬁndings are consistent with developmental research indicating that theory of
mind development is linked to advances in
general inhibitory control (Carlson & Moses
2001). It is plausible that a failure of this
process in adults may play a central role in
naı̈ve realism (Grifﬁn & Ross 1991, Pronin
et al. 2004), whereby individuals assume
that others see the world the same way that
they do and have difﬁculty acknowledging
alternative viewpoints (see Lieberman 2005).
Given the early development of sensitivity
to biological motion and the fact that adults
perceive biological motion without effort, one
would expect this to be a relatively automatic
process. Alternatively, explicit propositional
thought about the content of another’s mind

would seem to fall squarely within the domain
of controlled processes. One study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
conﬁrms these intuitions, as cognitive load
was found to diminish DMPFC responses, but
not pSTS or temporal pole responses, during
a mentalizing task (den Ouden et al. 2005).
Another study suggests that DMPFC is active
during covert mentalizing processes (German
et al. 2004); however, the covert condition in
this study appears to require more overt mentalizing than does the control condition.
It is also interesting to note that the only
medial activation (DMPFC) associated with
theory of mind processes is associated with the
internally-focused process of considering the
contents of another person’s mind. Sensitivity to biological motion and person familiarity
in lateral regions (pSTS and temporal poles,
respectively) are both externally-focused processes that do not require consideration of a
target’s internal states.

Representing psychological traits of others. Beyond knowing how the typical person would respond psychologically to particular events, individuals are also interested in
identifying the enduring psychological traits
of others. Individuals use their theories of
how people with different kinds of dispositions behave in order to infer targets’ dispositions from their behavior (Gilbert 1989). A
recent fMRI study of dispositional attribution
(Harris et al. 2005) found that when individuals read behavioral descriptions diagnostic for
drawing dispositional inferences about a target (Kelley 1967), both DMPFC and pSTS
were more active.
Another study (Mitchell et al. 2004) found
that trait-relevant action descriptions (e.g.,
“he refused to loan his extra blanket to the
other campers”) shown with a target face led
to DMPFC activity only when subjects had
an explicit goal to form an impression of the
target. This is the ﬁrst study to hold constant
the relevance of stimulus information for understanding the mental states or traits of another and instead manipulate whether or not
264

Lieberman

the subject has the goal of understanding another mind.
Given that controlled processes that support trait attribution should only occur when
the intention to make sense of another person is present, the study by Mitchell et al.
(2004) suggests that DMPFC contributes to
controlled processing aspects of trait attribution. Alternatively, pSTS was active in response to the action descriptions regardless
of the subject’s encoding goal ( J.P. Mitchell,
personal communication), a ﬁnding that suggests that this response reﬂects automatic social cognition. A similar dissociation has also
been observed between DMPFC and the temporal poles (Mason et al. 2004; M.F. Mason,
personal communication). Both of these results are consistent with the previously described study by den Ouden et al. (2005) that
examined the automatic and controlled components of theory of mind processes. Additionally, these ﬁndings are consistent with the
internal/external distinction observed in theory of mind research, as DMPFC was associated with encoding the psychological traits
of a target (internal), whereas pSTS and the
temporal poles were activated in response to
descriptions of observable behavior (external).

Experiencing the Mental States of
Others
Empathy. This second way of knowing
others is far more embodied than logical
(Merleau-Ponty 1962) and is more appropriately referred to as empathy than as theory
of mind. Empathy has been associated with
increased helping and social support (Batson
1991); however, this consequence of empathy
requires the individual to maintain an awareness that the emotional response is an embodied simulation of another person’s experience,
not to be confused with one’s own experience.
Thus, the two criteria for empathic responses
are (a) an emotional and experiential response
that approximates that of the target and (b) an
awareness and identiﬁcation of this emotion
as referring to the target’s experience.

A number of studies have now addressed
the ﬁrst of these criteria. Wicker et al.
(2003) found that two regions associated
with affective processing, the anterior insula
and dACC, were activated both when individuals smelled disgusting odors themselves
and when they watched videoclips of others smelling these odors. Similarly, a number
of studies have observed activation in these
two regions when individuals either felt physical pain or observed another feeling physical pain (Botvinick et al. 2005, Jackson et al.
2005, Morrison et al. 2004, Singer et al. 2004),
and the strength of these responses correlated
with self-reported trait empathy (Singer et al.
2004). Alternatively, Farrow et al. (2001) observed greater activity in VMPFC, MPFC,
DMPFC, and MPAC when individuals were
asked to make empathic judgments relative
to other forms of social reasoning. Similarly,
Botvinick et al. (2005) found greater VMPFC
activity when observing another’s pain but
not when feeling pain oneself, which suggests
that this region might contribute to the additional processes invoked by empathy over direct feeling. Finally, in two neuropsychological investigations of patients with different
cortical lesions (Shamay-Tsoory et al. 2003,
2005), VMPFC damage was found to be the
strongest predictor of empathic deﬁcits.
Interestingly, unlike theory of mind processes that logically proceed from externallyfocused processing of situational information
and observed behaviors to internally-focused
processing of another’s mental state, empathy is focused primarily on the experience of
another and is thus internally-focused. Consistent with this distinction, the empathy research reviewed here has typically found medial, rather than lateral, activations. It is also
worth noting that in comparison with representing other minds, the sense of experiencing
other minds appears to recruit brain regions
more closely tied with automatic affective processes, including the dACC and VMPFC.
Issues for empathy research. One open issue for empathy research is whether the pain

distress felt while watching another’s pain
is personal distress or empathic distress. In
Batson’s (1991) examination of empathy as it
relates to altruism, he cites Adam Smith, who
wrote about the distinction clearly: “In order
to enter into your grief, I do not consider what
I, a person of such a character and profession,
should suffer if I had a son and if that son
was unfortunately to die . . . . I not only change
circumstances with you, but I change persons
and characters” (1853/1759, p. VII).
In each of the neuroimaging studies of empathy, it is unclear whether subjects are imagining their own experience of pain or truly empathizing (for the study that is most successful at addressing this, see Singer et al. 2006).
In the same way that false-belief paradigms
were critical in establishing theory of mind
because accuracy required children to indicate that a target person had different beliefs
from their own, here the study of empathy
would seem to require situations in which the
subject and the target have different experiential responses. For instance, empathy while
watching a masochist receive painful stimulation might be expected to activate reward
rather than pain regions.

UNDERSTANDING ONESELF
Given that the self feels hermetically sealed
off from others, containing private thoughts
and feelings, one might wonder why the self is
so heavily researched by social psychologists
whose main focus is on social interactions and
situational pressures. The playwright Oscar
Wilde captured the social psychologist’s answer when he wrote, “Most people are other
people. Their thoughts are someone else’s
opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions
a quotation” (Wilde 1905). Social psychologists from Wilde’s era (Cooley 1902, Mead
1934) predicated their theories of the self on
the notion that the self is formed through social feedback from other people. They believed that what people experience as introspective self-talk is actually a conversation
with a simulated other who is an internalized

amalgam of our early social learning that
comes to serve as a guide for appropriate social
behavior. Thus, research on the self is integral
to social psychology (Baumeister 1998) and
now to social cognitive neuroscience. Here
and in the next section, the four topics that
have dominated social cognitive neuroscience
research on the self (self-recognition, selfreﬂection, self-knowledge, and self-control)
are reviewed.

Recognizing Oneself
Visual self-recognition. The ability for infants to visually recognize themselves in a
mirror comes online in the second year of
life, with most infants achieving this skill by
21 months of age (Lewis & Ramsay 2004).
This contrasts with the ability to recognize
one’s mother in a mirror by nine months
of age (Dixon 1957), suggesting that either
more time is needed for the neural machinery supporting self-recognition to mature or
more socialization is needed in which parents
can teach infants to identify themselves as a
self.
Perhaps because self-recognition is one of
the few self-processes that can be examined
in preverbal humans and animals it has received a great amount of attention. In what is
perhaps the ﬁrst social cognitive neuroscience
experiment, self-recognition processes examined in a split-brain patient (Sperry et al. 1979)
suggested that each hemisphere of the human brain was independently capable of recognizing the self. One study has replicated
this ﬁnding (Uddin et al. 2005b), whereas
the data in two others have each favored
one hemisphere or the other (Keenan et al.
2003, Turk et al. 2002). Other research using different techniques to isolate the processing of each hemisphere has also yielded
mixed results (Brady et al. 2004, Keenan et al.
2001).
A half-dozen fMRI studies clarify the neural basis of self-recognition to some extent.
Although there is also variability in the fMRI
studies examining self-recognition, most have
266

Lieberman

observed greater right LPFC and LPAC activity (Platek et al. 2006; Sugiura 2000, 2005;
Uddin et al. 2005a) when individuals identify pictures as themselves compared with
when they identify pictures of familiar others. Given the symbolic nature of the self, it
is not surprising that the regions involved in
self-recognition have been linked with controlled processing.
Agency. In addition to visual recognition of
one’s face, there is also the recognition of one’s
body parts and movements as one’s own, a process that involves the combined inputs from
the visual system and internal proprioception from the muscles. Neuroimaging (Farrer
et al. 2003, Farrer & Frith 2002, Leube et al.
2003, Shimada et al. 2005), transcranial magnetic stimulation (MacDonald & Paus 2003),
and neuropsychological studies (Sirigu et al.
1999) all suggest that LPAC regions bilaterally, but particularly on the right side, are involved in detecting mismatches between visual and proprioceptive feedback. In these
studies, video displays of the subject’s own
hand movements are shown to the subject
either in real time or at short delays such
that the visual feedback and proprioceptive
feedback are asynchronous. Results indicate
that greater LPAC activity is present during
mismatches than during matches. In related
work, schizophrenics experiencing passivity, a
state characterized by a feeling of not owning one’s own actions, showed greater activation of right LPAC (Franck et al. 2002,
Ganesan et al. 2005, Spence et al. 1997).
Similarly, Blanke and colleagues have shown,
with a variety of methods, that out-of-body
experiences are also associated with right
LPAC activity (Blanke et al. 2002). One
caveat to these ﬁndings is that the LPAC is
typically activated when the external visual
representation of one’s body conﬂicts with
one’s internal experience of oneself. Thus,
it may be more appropriate to suggest that
an absence of LPAC activation is associated
with the feeling that one’s actions are one’s
own.

Reﬂecting on the Self
Reﬂecting on one’s current experience.
Although other animals presumably have experiences, humans may be the only living
creatures who can reﬂect upon and explicitly
represent the character of those experiences.
Having explicit insight into the situations that
make one feel good or bad allows an individual to much more efﬁciently seek out or avoid
similar situations in the future. This insight
also allows individuals to communicate their
preferences and dislikes to others.
Reﬂecting on one’s current experience
leads to remarkably consistent activation of
MPFC (BA10) across a variety of different
tasks. BA10 is the only region of prefrontal
cortex that has thus far been found to be
disproportionally larger in humans than in
other primates (Semendeferi et al. 2001).
The studies that most directly isolate the act
of self-reﬂection have examined neural responses occurring when participants indicate
their current emotional response to a picture
(e.g., “How pleasant do you feel in response
to this picture?”) compared with when making a non-self-relevant judgment (e.g., “Is the
picture of an indoor or outdoor scene?”). In
each of these studies (Gusnard et al. 2001,
Johnson et al. 2005, Lane et al. 1997, Ochsner
et al. 2004), MPFC was more active during
self-reﬂection than during the control task.
Two of these studies ( Johnson & Schmitz
2005, Ochsner et al. 2004) found additional
activation in MPAC. Similarly, Eisenberger
et al. (2005) found that greater dispositional
self-consciousness was associated with greater
MPFC and MPAC activation during a conﬂict
detection task.
Given that cognitive tasks tend to decrease
the activity in MPFC (McKiernan et al. 2003),
it is possible that results of self-reﬂection studies are being driven by MPFC changes associated with the control condition rather than by
self-reﬂection per se. However, a neuropsychological study by Beer et al. (2003), which
is not susceptible to this alternate explanation, suggests that this is not the case. In

their study, patients with extensive damage
to MPFC, as well as VMPFC, experienced
less self-conscious emotion after engaging in
inappropriate behavior compared with controls, suggesting that MPFC is associated with
initiating or carrying out self-reﬂective processes. Surprisingly, patients with MPFC lesions are capable of self-conscious emotions
if shown their embarrassing behavior on a
video recording (Beer et al. 2006), a process that may rely on externally-focused visual self-recognition mechanisms rather than
internally-focused self-reﬂection. Taylor et al.
(2003) also observed increases in MPFC activity, relative to a resting baseline, when participants rated their own emotional reaction
to emotional stimuli, also suggesting that the
MPFC ﬁndings in other studies are not artifacts of the control conditions.
Interestingly, Taylor et al. (2003) found
that self-reﬂection on emotional stimuli was
also associated with reduced activity in the
amygdala, a region implicated in automatic affective processes (Pasley et al. 2004). Although
it seems paradoxical that self-reﬂection on
one’s feelings could lead to a reduction in
those feelings, this result is consistent with
other behavioral research (Silvia 2002, Wilson
et al. 2005, Wilson & Schooler 1991) and
highlights the fact that feelings themselves
and thoughts about feelings are not necessarily isomorphic (Lieberman 2006).
Given that self-reﬂection feels effortful
and resource consuming, it is not surprising that this process relies on neural structures that have undergone recent evolutionary development (Semendeferi et al. 2001)
and whose activity is interrupted by cognitive load manipulations (Greicius et al. 2003,
McKiernan et al. 2003). Perhaps somewhat
more surprising is that the neural correlates
of self-reﬂection are quite distinct from those
involved in self-recognition and agency judgments. Self-reﬂection, an internally-focused
process, is strongly associated with activity
in a medial frontoparietal network, whereas
self-recognition and agency judgments invoke
externally-focused processes and are strongly

associated with activity in a lateral frontoparietal network. Such a dramatic dissociation
between self-reﬂection and self-recognition
processes is not easily accounted for in existing social psychological theories.

Reﬂecting on past experiences. In addition to being able to reﬂect upon our current
experience, we are also capable of reﬂecting
on our autobiographical past, the events of
personal importance that have made up our
lives. People do not recall all events from
their past equally well. Remembering one’s
wedding is presumably easier than remembering what one had for breakfast August 21,
2001. Our autobiographical memory tends
to be ﬁlled with events of personal signiﬁcance, rather than a linear record of events
over time (Lieberman & Eisenberger 2005).
Thus, although autobiographical memory
and episodic memory bear more than a passing resemblance, their neural correlates are
only partially overlapping.
Gilboa (2004) reviewed the prefrontal activations in 14 neuroimaging studies that contained both autobiographical and episodic
memory conditions. Gilboa reported that although VLPFC activations are common to
retrieving both forms of memory, MPFC
(BA10) and VMPFC (BA11) are present
only in autobiographical memory retrieval,
whereas right DLPFC is present primarily in
episodic memory retrieval. The medial activations associated with autobiographical memories may result from these memories being
linked to one’s internal sense of self and the
feelings one had during the events. Multiple studies have also observed MTL activity during both kinds of memory retrieval,
but more so during autobiographical retrieval
than episodic retrieval (Cabeza et al. 2004,
Gilboa et al. 2004).
Reﬂecting on one’s self-concept. Within
the study of self-focused processing, reﬂection upon one’s own self-concept in trait terms
(e.g., “kind,” “smart”) has received a great
deal of attention (for review, see Lieberman
268

Lieberman

& Pfeifer 2005). Several studies have examined the neural activity involved in determining whether trait words and sentences are
self-descriptive. Most of these studies have
included a nonsocial control task, such as determining the number of vowels in the trait
words ( Johnson et al. 2002). The studies often included a social control task, such as determining whether the trait term describes
a close friend (Ochsner et al. 2005, Schmitz
et al. 2004), casual acquaintance (Seger et al.
2004), famous politician (Craik et al. 1999,
Kelley et al. 2002, Kjaer et al. 2002), or
whether the trait is socially desirable (Fossati
et al. 2003). Virtually all of these studies report greater MPFC during the self-judgments
task than during the nonsocial control task,
and several also report greater MPFC during self-judgments than during other social
judgments (Craik et al. 1999, Fossati et al.
2003, Kelley et al. 2002, Schmitz et al. 2004).
Additionally, a number of these studies also
report greater activity in MPAC during selfjudgments (Fossati et al. 2003, Johnson et al.
2002, Kelley et al. 2002, Seger et al. 2004). In
two other studies, individuals were prompted
to think about their own personality characteristics over a period of minutes; greater
MPFC and MPAC were observed in this
condition than when participants thought
about someone else’s personality characteristics (D’Argembeau et al. 2005, Kjaer et al.
2002). In addition, in two studies (Fossati et al.
2004, Macrae et al. 2004) that examined the
effects of self-referential encoding on memory, it was observed that greater MPFC activity during self-referential encoding is associated with better memory performance for
this information (for an analogous study linking DMPFC with memory for social information, see Mitchell et al. 2004). These studies
are remarkably consistent in identifying activity in a medial frontoparietal network when
individuals reﬂect on their own psychological
make-up, an internally-focused process.
These studies, however, have not disentangled the act of self-reﬂection (i.e., effortfully trying to think about oneself ) from

<-----Page 10----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2007.58:259-289. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org

self-knowledge activation (i.e., the knowledge
that is reﬂected upon and retrieved). Although
the act of self-reﬂection is a canonical form
of controlled processing, self-knowledge consists of both automatically accessible and effortfully retrieved representations (Klein et al.
1992, 1996; Markus 1977). Lieberman et al.
(2004) examined the neural responses of individuals who possessed strong self-schemas
(i.e., automatically accessible self-knowledge)
for either acting or athletics while they judged
the trait descriptiveness of trait words related to acting or athletics. Retrieval of nonschematic self-knowledge was relatively slow
and was associated with activity in DMPFC
and MTL, whereas automatically accessible
schematic self-knowledge was associated with
activity in VMPFC, amygdala, ventral striatum in the basal ganglia, LTC, and MPAC.
The absence of MPFC in this comparison
suggests that the primary role of MPFC is
in self-reﬂection rather than self-knowledge
representation (see also J.H. Pfeifer, M.D.
Lieberman, & M. Dapretto, under review).

SELF-REGULATION
The capacity for self-regulation is critical to
the achievement of both personal and social
goals. Self-regulatory skills allow us to act in
accordance with long-term goals (e.g., getting a promotion) rather than being slaves
to our emotional impulses (e.g., wanting to
yell at one’s boss). Indeed, individual differences in the ability to delay gratiﬁcation as
a child are highly predictive of achievement
decades later (Metcalfe & Mischel 1999). Selfregulation has received a great deal of attention within the social cognitive neuroscience
and broader cognitive neuroscience literature.
Although the neural regions associated with
self-regulation are quite similar across the different forms of self-regulation, there is also a
major conceptual distinction between those
forms of self-regulation in which the individual has the intention to regulate a response
and other forms of self-regulation in which

the regulatory effects occur, but only as an
unintended by-product of other processes.

Intentional Self-Regulation
Impulse control. A number of neuroimaging studies have examined the process
whereby individuals intentionally override a
prepotent response or impulse. The two brain
regions that have consistently been associated
with this process are dACC and LPFC (MacDonald et al. 2000). A number of studies have
implicated the dACC in detecting the conﬂict
between a current goal and the prepotent response rather than in the process of exerting
top-down control to facilitate the appropriate
response or inhibit the inappropriate response
(Botvinick et al. 2004). Alternatively, LPFC
has been more closely tied to maintaining the
current goal in working memory and to implementing the top-down control needed to
produce appropriate responses (Aron et al.
2004). Similar LPFC activations are present
when individuals must inhibit beliefs in order
to reason correctly (Goel & Dolan 2003).
Reappraising emotional events. Recent
studies have built on the impulse control ﬁndings by examining self-control of emotional
responses and emotional experience (Ochsner
& Gross 2005). These studies have examined reappraisal as a strategy for emotional
self-control. Reappraisal typically involves reframing a negative emotional event such that
the new understanding renders the event less
aversive. Reappraisal efforts commonly activate regions of LPFC, most often VLPFC,
regardless of whether the reappraisal focuses
on trying to reduce the emotional signiﬁcance
of highly aversive images (Ochsner et al. 2002,
2004; Phan et al. 2005), physical pain anticipation (Kalisch et al. 2005), sad ﬁlms (Levesque
et al. 2003), or erotic ﬁlms (Beauregard et al.
2001). This manipulation also tends to produce decreased activity in the amygdala, with
some studies also showing decreased activity in either temporal pole or VMPFC. In
one study, Ochsner et al. (2004) manipulated

whether individuals reappraised in order to
feel more or less negative affect and manipulated whether individuals reappraised in ways
that focused on changes in the target’s physical situation or in ways that focused on the
subject’s personal relationship to the target.
Reappraising to increase negative affect was
associated with activity in DMPFC, MPFC,
and posterior cingulate near MPAC, whereas
reappraising to decrease negative affect was
associated with right lateral orbitofrontal cortex in the vicinity of VLPFC. One can imagine that instructions to increase their negative
emotional responses may have led participants to spontaneously engage in internallyfocused empathy for the target (resulting in
more medial activity), whereas instructions to
decrease negative affect may have led participants to engage in externally-focused detachment from the target (resulting in more lateral
activity). Similarly, reappraisals focused on
one’s personal relation to the target activated
rACC, whereas situation-focused reappraisal
activated left LPFC. Here again, the split between medial and lateral prefrontal activations maps onto internally- versus externallyfocused processes, respectively.

Unintentional Self-Regulation
Putting feelings into words. It has long
been known that putting feelings into words
is an effective strategy for regulating negative emotional responses. Although expressing these feelings is known to have beneﬁts for
both mental and physical health (Hemenover
2003, Pennebaker 1997), the beneﬁts seem to
occur whether one is intentionally trying to
regulate one’s emotions or not, and even occur
if one writes about an imaginary trauma rather
an actual one (Greenberg et al. 1996). A number of neuroimaging studies have shown that
merely labeling emotionally evocative visual
images with emotional labels (i.e., affect labeling) leads to a reduction in the amygdala activity that would otherwise occur in the presence
of these images (Hariri et al. 2000, Lieberman
et al. 2006). These studies also show increased
270

Lieberman

activity in right VLPFC during affect labeling
and an inverse relationship between this prefrontal activity and the activity in the amygdala. Thus, the pattern of activity is very similar to the pattern observed during reappraisal
processes, suggesting that self-regulation is
occurring despite the absence of any intention to self-regulate.
Placebo effects. Expectancy-based placebo
effects typically involve a consciously held
belief about the effectiveness of a treatment
or medication that leads to a reduction in
aversive symptoms. Although only a handful of neuroimaging studies have examined
placebo effects, the results have been remarkably consistent. Investigations of placebo effects on momentary pain stimulation (Kong
et al. 2006, Petrovic et al. 2002, Wager et al.
2004), chronic pain (Lieberman et al. 2004),
and the distress associated with aversive images (Petrovic et al. 2005) have almost all observed greater activity in right VLPFC and
rACC during placebo compared with control conditions. Placebo effects were also associated with reductions in subjective distress, dACC activity, or amygdala activity,
with rACC and LPFC activations predicting
the magnitude of these reductions. Interestingly, both rACC and right VLPFC overlap
with the opioid network evoked during opioid analgesia (Petrovic et al. 2002). As with
putting feelings into words, placebo effects invoke a network similar to that observed during reappraisal, a ﬁnding that suggests common processes are at work despite different
phenomenologies accompanying reappraisal,
placebo, and putting feelings into words.

BEING IN A SOCIAL WORLD
A great deal of our waking lives is spent
navigating the social world with others, and
many of the processes already reviewed presumably evolved, in part, to facilitate social
living (Dunbar 1998). The topics reviewed
in this section all link the self and social
world together within a single mental act. We

coordinate our activity with those around us,
use feedback from others to understand ourselves, make sense of others based on our selftheories, and develop personal attitudes about
social groups. We also care deeply about being
connected to loved ones, not being rejected,
and being treated in a fair and trustworthy
manner in our interactions with strangers. Together, these processes contribute to a coherent social world in which individuals continuously make adjustments to conform to the
norms of other individuals and society more
generally.

Mirror Neurons and Imitation
In the early 1990s, di Pellegrino and colleagues discovered a class of neurons in primates that were activated both when primates
performed a goal-directed action (e.g., grasping an object) and when they observed the
experimenter perform the same action (e.g.,
grasp the same object). Dubbed mirror neurons, the presence of these neurons suggests
that the same motor action representations
are activated when performing and observing goal-directed actions (di Pellegrino et al.
1992). This is analogous to Kosslyn’s earlier
ﬁnding that visual perception and visual imagery both rely on the same visual code in
visual cortex (for review, see Kosslyn et al.
2001). In humans, activation in regions homologous to those found in primates has also
been reported both when participants observe
intentional action and when they imitate intentional action (Iacoboni et al. 1999). In particular, regions of LPFC (pars opercularis in
BA44) and LPAC have been found to follow
this pattern.
It has been widely speculated that mirror neurons represent a basis for understanding the behavior, intentions, and experience
of others, but this has not yet been demonstrated empirically. One can imitate without
understanding, and to date, no mirror neuron study has assessed whether activity in
the mirror neuron system is associated with
the experience of understanding the perspec-

tive or experience of another. Based on the
earlier section that focused on understanding others, one would expect that if imitation
promoted or served as a form of embodied
understanding of another’s mental states, it
would lead to increased activity in the medial frontoparietal network. Instead, imitation
is associated with a lateral frontoparietal network consistent with externally-focused understanding of physical action but not with
internally-focused processes such as mental
state representation or empathy. Indeed, research examining the imitation of emotional
facial expressions observed less activity in
DMPFC during imitation than observation
(Carr et al. 2003), a ﬁnding that suggests that
imitation may demand externally-focused attention to the actions as actions, rather than
as indicators of another’s internal states.
It is possible, however, that mirror neurons play an important role in nonverbal communication (i.e., gestures, facial expressions,
and posture; see DePaulo 1992). There is
evidence for a complex reciprocal nonverbal “dance” that occurs between interaction
partners (Word et al. 1974) that can provide
the basis for our judgments about an interaction (Chartrand & Bargh 1999). The difﬁculty in making this link is that whereas a
great deal of nonverbal communication occurs without conscious effort (Ambady et al.
2000, Lieberman 2000), the human imaging
research on mirror neurons has examined explicit intentions to observe and imitate a single behavior that is presented focally. The
connection between mirror neuron work and
nonverbal communication could be strengthened if the mirror neuron system were found
to be similarly activated by behaviors that are
embedded in a larger scene unfolding over
time, while participants are not attending to
the behavior focally or under cognitive load.

Interactions of Self and Social
Understanding
Reﬂected appraisals (i.e., “what I think you
think of me”) are thought to be a critical

source of self-knowledge throughout development (Cooley 1902, Mead 1934). A single
neuroimaging study has examined the neural
bases of reﬂected appraisals. Ochsner et al.
(2005) observed that reﬂected appraisal processes were associated with greater activity in
the orbital extension of right VLPFC, MTL,
and MPAC, compared with direct appraisals
of the self. This pattern of activation is consistent with the notion that overt generation of
reﬂected appraisals is an effortful controlled
process.
In contrast to reﬂected appraisals, which
involve consulting one’s theory of another
person’s mind in order to understand oneself, under some conditions, individuals may
consult their theories of themselves in order
to understand other individuals. The existing evidence suggests that this occurs when
the target is a close associate of or is seen
as similar to the participant. When individuals judge the psychological traits and states
of their mother (Ruby & Decety 2004), close
friend (Ochsner et al. 2005), or someone
rated as similar to themselves (Mitchell et al.
2005), signiﬁcant activations are produced in
MPFC, the region most typically found in
self-reﬂective processes. Mitchell et al. (2005)
also reported an interaction between DMPFC
and MPFC activity as a function of similarity
between the participant and target, such that
DMPFC activity decreased and MPFC activity increased with increasing similarity. This
suggests that similarity is promoting understanding the minds of others in terms of one’s
theory of oneself.

Attitudes and Prejudice
Implicit and explicit attitudes. Attitudes
serve a critical function in our social lives
as they support and deﬁne our social identities. When we share our attitudes with others, we are providing a roadmap to our behavioral proclivities and a promissory note
regarding our reactions to different attituderelevant situations. Neuroimaging work on
attitudes has primarily focused on identify272

Lieberman

ing the neural correlates of implicit and explicit attitudes. When individuals express explicit attitudes toward concepts (Cunningham et al. 2004b, Zysset et al. 2002), famous names (Cunningham et al. 2003), geometrical shapes ( Jacobson et al. 2006), or
paintings (Vartanian & Goel 2004), activation
tends to increase in both medial and lateral
frontoparietal networks, compared with when
nonevaluative judgments are made about the
same stimuli. This network includes MPFC,
MPAC, VLPFC, and LPAC. These regions
have all been associated with controlled processes and are consistent with the notion that
the expression of explicit attitudes depends on
controlled processing. Additionally, an eventrelated potential study (Cunningham et al.
2005; see also Cela-Conde et al. 2004) observed that the LPFC activations associated
with explicit attitudes appear at least 400 ms
after the presentation of the attitude object,
also implicating LPFC in controlled processing of attitudes (Neely 1977).
Other studies have identiﬁed brain regions
associated with implicit attitudes. In these
studies, negative- and positive-attitude objects, such as African American and Caucasian
American faces, are shown to individuals as
they perform a nonevaluative task (e.g., gender judgments). Typically, the amygdala has
been found to be more active to negativeattitude objects than to positive-attitude objects (Cunningham et al. 2003, Hart et al.
2000, Wheeler & Fiske 2005; for review
of race-related neuroimaging, see Eberhardt
2005; for race-related electroencephalogram
research, see Ito et al. 2006). Phelps et al.
(2000) observed that the amygdala response
of Caucasian Americans to African American
faces was correlated with an implicit measure of racial attitudes but not with an explicit attitude measure (cf. Phelps et al. 2003).
Lieberman et al. (2005) found that African
American subjects also showed greater amygdala activity to African American faces than
to Caucasian American faces, consistent with
past ﬁndings that African Americans have
negative implicit attitudes toward African

Americans, in contrast to their positive explicit attitudes toward African Americans
(Nosek et al. 2002). Cunningham et al.
(2004b) found that the amygdala response to
African American faces was stronger when target faces were presented subliminally rather
than supraliminally and that the amygdala was
the only brain region that showed this pattern of activity. Apart from the amygdala, the
only other brain region that has been associated with implicit attitudes is VMPFC. Milne
& Grafman (2001) conducted a study of patients with VMPFC damage and observed no
implicit gender bias. Similarly, Knutson et al.
(2006) found VMPFC activity associated with
the automatic activation of political attitudes.
These results are consistent with ﬁndings
from McClure et al. (2004) demonstrating
that VMPFC activity was associated with behavioral preferences between Coke and Pepsi
when individuals were unaware of the brand
they were drinking. Alternatively, when individuals were informed of the brand they were
drinking, behavioral preferences were associated with activity in controlled processing
regions, DLPFC and MTL.
Regulating prejudicial responses. A number of neuroimaging studies have combined
the study of intentional self-regulation with
the study of race-related attitudes in order to
understand the mechanisms by which people
control their prejudicial responses. As with
self-control more generally, it appears that the
dACC may be involved in detecting that an
undesirable attitude is prepotent and about
to be revealed (Amodio et al. 2004), whereas
LPFC regions tend to be implicated in exerting control and diminishing the activity of the
amygdala. Multiple studies have shown that a
desire to regulate the expression of a particular attitude is associated with greater activity
of right LPFC in the presence of the attitude
object (Cunningham et al. 2004a,b; Richeson
et al. 2003). Additionally, the magnitude of
right LPFC under conditions promoting prejudice regulation is associated with the extent

to which amygdala responses are diminished
(Cunningham et al. 2004a).
Unintentional self-regulation of prejudicial attitudes has also been demonstrated in
fMRI studies. Simply categorizing African
American targets in terms of their personal
food preferences rather than their group
membership was sufﬁcient to reverse the
amygdala’s response to African American
and Caucasian American targets (Wheeler &
Fiske 2005). In another study, similar to the
affect-labeling studies described above, processing the race of targets verbally rather than
perceptually was sufﬁcient to eliminate the
amygdala’s sensitivity to race, and this reduction was related to increases in right VLPFC
activity (Lieberman et al. 2005).
Attitude change. Cognitive dissonance research has established that when individuals
perform a behavior or make a choice that
conﬂicts with a previously established attitude, the attitude tends to change in the direction that resolves the conﬂict with the behavior. From the outside, this process appears
to involve rationalization, whereby individuals strategically change their attitudes in order to avoid appearing inconsistent. However,
neuropsychological work by Lieberman et al.
(2001) demonstrated that this might not always be a conscious strategic process. In one
study, anterograde amnesia patients, who had
neurological damage affecting the functioning of MTL and were incapable of forming
new memories, were compared with healthy
controls on a dissonance task. The amnesics
had no memory of having performed a behavior that conﬂicted with their previously established attitudes and thus were not likely to
have engaged in conscious strategic attitude
change. Nonetheless, the amnesics changed
their attitudes to the same extent as controls.
These results suggest that, rather than conscious rationalization, cognitive dissonance
reduction may sometimes depend on implicit
constraint satisfaction processes (Read et al.
1997).

Social Connection and Social
Rejection

Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2007.58:259-289. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org
by University of Waterloo on 02/10/11. For personal use only.

Social connection. The need for social connection and acceptance are powerful motivators (Baumeister & Leary 1995) that guide
human interactions with peers, romantic partners, and family. Although behavioral work in
social psychology has emphasized the power
of unfamiliar individuals to inﬂuence our own
behavior (Asch 1956, Sherif 1937), few neuroimaging studies have examined this form
of social pressure (Amodio et al. 2006, Berns
et al. 2005). Instead, neuroimaging studies
have focused primarily on neural responses
associated with responses to close others. In
these studies, individuals are shown pictures of
either their romantic partner or their own infant along with relevant control images. Most
often, when individuals see someone they
love, they show greater activity in the basal
ganglia (Aron et al. 2005; Bartels & Zeki 2000,
2004; Leibenluft et al. 2004; cf. Nitschke et al.
2004). Two of these studies also found a broad
network of theory of mind areas to be less active during the presentation of a loved one
than a control (Bartels & Zeki 2000, 2004);
however, another study found the opposite
pattern of activity (Leibenluft et al. 2004).
These differences may be attributed to the
fact that in the studies showing a decrease
in these regions, the images were presented
for ∼15 seconds, whereas in the study showing an increase in these regions, the images
were presented for 1.5 seconds. Thus, there
may be differences in the immediate and longterm responses to the presentation of images
of loved ones.
Social rejection. Mammals, unlike their reptilian ancestors, form long-term parental
bonds with their young. Separation from caregivers typically results in death for young
mammals. dACC activity has been associated
with the distress of losing social connections.
Primates with lesions to this region display
a reduced frequency of distress vocalizations
(MacLean & Newman 1988), whereas stim274

Lieberman

ulation of this region spontaneously induces
distress vocalizations (Robinson 1967, Smith
1945). Additionally, cingulate-lesioned female
rodents do not provide effective maternal
care, resulting in a 12% survival rate for their
offspring compared with 95% for offspring
from sham-lesioned rodents (Stamm 1955).
In humans, neuroimaging studies of social exclusion (Eisenberger 2006, Eisenberger
et al. 2003) have found that self-reports of social distress are strongly related to dACC activity during exclusion, whereas right VLPFC
was associated with downregulating both
dACC activity and self-reported social distress. Attachment anxiety is also related to
dACC activity when thinking about negative
relationship scenarios (Gillath et al. 2005). In
related work, the sound of infant cries activated dACC (Lorberbaum et al. 2002) and did
so more for parents than nonparents (Seifritz
et al. 2003). Finally, a recent study of grief
found that activity in dACC, along with a
number of theory of mind regions, was greater
when bereaved individuals looked at pictures
of the recently deceased individual compared
with control images (Gundel et al. 2003; cf.
Najib et al. 2004).
It has been hypothesized that mammalian
social pain may have evolved out of the existing system for physical pain (Eisenberger &
Lieberman 2004, MacDonald & Leary 2005,
Panksepp 1998), with dACC playing a key
role in the emotional distress of physical pain
(Rainville et al. 1997). Evidence comes for
this, in part, from laboratory ﬁndings that
feeling socially rejected heightens sensitivity
to physical pain (Eisenberger et al. 2006a),
whereas social support reduces sensitivity to
physical pain (Brown et al. 2003).
Heightened activity in the dACC, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray (another component of the pain matrix; Peyron et al. 2000)
during a social rejection episode in the fMRI
scanner has also been linked to greater reports of social disconnection in day-to-day life
using an experience-sampling methodology
(Eisenberger 2006). Finally, dACC reactivity
during social rejection has been found to

mediate the relationship between a polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A gene
and aggression in males (Eisenberger et al.
2006b), such that this gene may render individuals more sensitive to social threats and

Social Decision-Making
Social and moral reasoning. Behavioral
research has shown that performance on
conditional reasoning tasks is substantially
improved if the conditional rules are formulated from real social norms rather than from
abstract content (Cheng & Holyoak 1985).
Neuroimaging studies investigating domainspeciﬁc reasoning effects have found a lateral
frontoparietal network that is more active during conditional social reasoning than during
conditional abstract reasoning (Canessa et al.
2005, Fiddick et al. 2005), with one group also
observing greater activity in DMPFC during
social reasoning (Fiddick et al. 2005). It is important to note that the social rules used in
these tasks did not require representing mental states (e.g., if a man is drinking beer, he
must be over 21), and thus the predominance
of lateral frontoparietal activity is consistent
with other domains covered in this review.
More attention has been given to the study
of moral reasoning. The most common ﬁnding across these studies is that moral reasoning activates MPFC to a greater extent
than do relevant control tasks (Heekeren et al.
2003; Moll et al. 2002a,b, 2005), with some
of these studies also ﬁnding greater activation in pSTS and the temporal poles. In the
ﬁrst neuroimaging study of moral reasoning,
Greene et al. (2001) compared personal and
impersonal moral reasoning. In the personal
condition, individuals were induced to focus
on their own personal involvement in bringing about a distasteful but utilitarian outcome;
in the impersonal condition, individuals were
induced to focus primarily on the utilitarian
outcome. The personal condition activated
a medial frontoparietal network along with

LPAC to a greater degree than did the impersonal condition, consistent with the notion
that the personal condition promotes selfreﬂection on the implications of one’s contribution to the outcome. The impersonal
condition, in contrast, led to greater activity in lateral frontoparietal regions than did
the personal condition, consistent with an external focus on events in the world. A recent
study (Mendez et al. 2005) with patients with
MPFC damage conﬁrmed these results: The
patients were impaired in making personal
moral judgments but not impersonal moral
judgments.
Fairness and trust in interactions. A new
area of research, neuroeconomics (Camerer
et al. 2005, Trepel et al. 2005), has combined the study of behavioral economics and
cognitive neuroscience. Studies that involve
economic exchange with social dynamics are
particularly relevant to social cognitive neuroscience. These studies use paradigms such
as the ultimatum game (Sanfey et al. 2003),
the prisoner’s dilemma (Rilling et al. 2002),
and the trust game (de Quervain et al. 2004)
in order to examine the neural responses associated with cooperation, competition, fairness, and trust. Across these studies, cooperation, trust, and fair play typically activate
VMPFC, MPFC, and MPAC (Decety et al.
2004, McCabe et al. 2001, Rilling et al. 2002),
whereas unfair and untrustworthy responses
activate insula (Sanfey et al. 2003), caudate in
the basal ganglia (de Quervain et al. 2004),
or DMPFC (Decety et al. 2004). The ﬁnding
that cooperation, relative to competition, promotes MPFC rather than DMPFC activity is
consistent with previously described work by
Mitchell et al. (2005), such that cooperation
may be associated with seeing the other players as more similar to oneself (see Decety et al.
2004). Cooperation has long been studied as
a technique for overcoming intergroup differences and promoting a sense of shared identity
(Sherif et al. 1961).
Across these studies of fairness and trust,
the fairness of the decision-making process

has often been confounded with the material
value of the outcome. That is, fair responses
from a partner are typically associated with
better ﬁnancial outcomes for the subject. G.
Tabibnia, A.B. Satpute, & M.D. Lieberman
(under review) recently manipulated the material payoffs and the fairness of the partner’s behavior independently. After controlling for material payoffs, fairness still activated
an array of motivation- and reward-related regions, including VMPFC, ventral striatum in
the basal ganglia, and amygdala, which suggests that fairness is hedonically valued in
social interactions.

CORE PROCESSES
Automatic Versus Controlled
Processes
Across the different domains of social cognitive neuroscience that allow for an assessment of their automatic and controlled
components, a clear pattern of neural activation emerges (see Figure 2). Some social psychological processes, by their very
nature, appear to consist exclusively of either automatic or controlled processes (e.g.,
self-reﬂection, moral decision-making, feeling rejected). Other processes involve task
conditions and baseline conditions that intuitively seem to compare controlled processes
with spontaneous processes that may be more
automatic (e.g., reappraisal, affect labeling).
Finally, some processes have been examined
with tasks that manipulate whether particular
controlled processes of interest are likely to
operate or not (e.g., theory of mind, dispositional attribution, self-knowledge, and attitude processes), providing the clearest examination of automaticity and control.
The picture that emerges is consistent with
previous work on the neural systems supporting reﬂective and reﬂexive social cognition
(Lieberman et al. 2002, Satpute & Lieberman
2006). Here, controlled forms of social cognition were consistently associated with ac-

276

Lieberman

tivations in LPFC, LPAC, MPFC, MPAC,
and MTL. Alternatively, automatic forms of
social cognition were consistently associated
with activations in amygdala, VMPFC, and
LTC. Not enough studies of automatic and
controlled social cognition have implicated
the basal ganglia or rACC one way or another to allow an assessment. Also, the studies were mixed regarding the contribution of
dACC. Based on the existing results, dACC
could either be (a) engaged in active controlled processing or (b) responding to goalrelated conﬂict automatically (Bargh 1989)
and then triggering other controlled processes as a result. Either alternative would
produce dACC activity during tasks that
recruit controlled processes in response to
conﬂict.
Although these results must be considered
preliminary, they do suggest that differences
between automatic and controlled processes
may constitute a core-processing distinction
in the study of social cognitive neuroscience.
Given the importance that this distinction has
had over the past 20 years within the ﬁeld
of social cognition (Chaiken & Trope 1999,
Wegner & Bargh 1998), it is valuable to identify the neural regions that support this distinction. In the long run, it may be possible to
conduct studies in which the extent of automatic and controlled processing can be identiﬁed from neuroimaging alone, without the
need for cognitive load or subliminal presentations, which would allow for more naturalistic investigations of automatic and controlled
social cognition (cf. Poldrack 2006).

Internally-Versus
Externally-Focused Processes
Across a number of social psychological domains, a clear division is present between
the neural correlates of tasks that focus attention on interior psychological worlds and
tasks that focus attention on the exterior social
world and the physical social agents in it (see
Figure 3). Externally-focused processes are

associated with a lateral frontotemporoparietal network, whereas internally-focused processes are associated with a medial frontoparietal network.
A lateral frontotemporoparietal network is
more activated by social-cognitive tasks that
focus attention on the external, physical, and
most often visual characteristics of other individuals, oneself, or the interaction of the two.
This lateral frontotemporoparietal network is
activated in tasks involving the nonmentalizing aspects of theory of mind and dispositional attribution tasks, action observation
and imitation, visual self-recognition, impersonal moral and social reasoning, reappraisal
by focusing on physical events, and labeling
the visual displays of affect in the facial expressions of others.
In contrast, a medial frontoparietal network is more activated by social-cognitive
tasks that focus attention on the internal, mental, emotional, and experiential characteristics
of other individuals or oneself. This medial
frontoparietal network is activated by tasks involving the mentalizing aspects of theory of
mind and dispositional attribution tasks, empathy, self-reﬂection on current experiences,
autobiographical memory, self-reﬂection on
one’s traits, personalized moral reasoning, and
reappraisal by focusing on one’s personal relation to a target.
It is important to note that this distinction is orthogonal to and cuts across self
and other processing. Consequently, this distinction refers to two ways that self and
other can each be processed. In the absence
of existing neurocognitive data, it is hard
to imagine making a case for self-reﬂection
having such a distinct representational basis
from self-recognition. However, in the context of the distinction between internally- and
externally-focused processes that emerged

from this review, these results are entirely
sensible.

CONCLUSION
Social cognitive neuroscience is a vibrant
young area of research. The amount of research and the number of scientists conducting research at the interface of the social
sciences and neuroscience have increased by
an order of magnitude since the ﬁrst review
of social cognitive neuroscience (Ochsner &
Lieberman 2001). Several exciting lines of social cognitive neuroscience research are providing new discoveries, generating original
ideas, and challenging longstanding conceptions of existing social science perspectives.
This is exactly what interdisciplinary crossfertilization should do. Here, I have provided
evidence for two broad organizing principles
of social cognition within the human brain,
one quite old and one that is new. The distinction between automatic and controlled social
cognition has long been a contributor to social
psychological research. Identifying the neural
bases of this distinction will help social cognitive neuroscience research to carve social processes at their joints, just as it has helped social
psychologists in the past. In contrast to automaticity and control, the distinction between
internally-focused and externally-focused social cognition has no clear theoretical precursor in social psychology, but emerges unmistakably from social cognitive neuroscience
research (see also Eisenberger et al. 2005,
Ochsner et al. 2004). Hopefully, the identiﬁcation of this core-processing distinction can
contribute to the development of new theories
and the enrichment of existing theories within
the social sciences, demonstrating that social
cognitive neuroscience can be both a science
of new techniques and a science of new ideas.
