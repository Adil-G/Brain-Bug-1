Trust, Trustworthiness, and Trust Propensity: A Meta-Analytic Test of
Their Unique Relationships With Risk Taking and Job Performance

University of Florida
The trust literature distinguishes trustworthiness (the ability, benevolence, and integrity of a trustee) and
trust propensity (a dispositional willingness to rely on others) from trust (the intention to accept
vulnerability to a trustee based on positive expectations of his or her actions). Although this distinction
has clarified some confusion in the literature, it remains unclear (a) which trust antecedents have the
strongest relationships with trust and (b) whether trust fully mediates the effects of trustworthiness and
trust propensity on behavioral outcomes. Our meta-analysis of 132 independent samples summarized the
relationships between the trust variables and both risk taking and job performance (task performance,
citizenship behavior, counterproductive behavior). Meta-analytic structural equation modeling supported
a partial mediation model wherein trustworthiness and trust propensity explained incremental variance in
the behavioral outcomes when trust was controlled. Further analyses revealed that the trustworthiness
dimensions also predicted affective commitment, which had unique relationships with the outcomes
when controlling for trust. These results generalized across different types of trust measures (i.e., positive
expectations measures, willingness-to-be-vulnerable measures, and direct measures) and different trust
referents (i.e., leaders, coworkers).

Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Zand, 1972), often operationalizing it using cooperative choices in a dilemma game (e.g.,
Deutsch, 1958, 1960).
Two articles published in the mid-to-late 1990s attempted to
clarify some of this confusion (Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al.,
1998). Mayer et al.’s integrative model defined trust as the willingness of a trustor to be vulnerable to the actions of a trustee
based on the expectation that the trustee will perform a particular
action. Similarly, Rousseau et al.’s cross-discipline review defined
trust as a psychological state comprising the intentions to accept
vulnerability based on positive expectations of the actions of the
trustee. Both definitions have two primary components. One component is the intention to accept vulnerability, which is rooted in
several earlier conceptualizations of trust (e.g., Boon & Holmes,
1991; Deutsch, 1958; Govier, 1994; Zand, 1972). The other component is positive expectations, also present in several earlier
conceptualizations of trust (e.g., Barber, 1983; Boon & Holmes,
1991; Cook & Wall, 1980; Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975;
Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974).
In addition to clarifying what trust is, Mayer et al.’s (1995)
integrative model clarified what trust is not. First and foremost,
Mayer et al.’s model separated trust from trustworthiness, with
three characteristics of the trustee (ability, benevolence, and integrity) appearing as antecedents of trust. This structure, which has
been adopted in subsequent models (McKnight et al., 1998; Ross
& LaCroix, 1996; M. Williams, 2001) echoes Gabarro’s (1978)
suggestion that trustworthiness is a multifaceted construct that
captures the competence and character of the trustee (see also
Butler, 1991; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Kee & Knox, 1970). In
addition, Mayer et al. drew a distinction between trust as a situational state and trust as a personality variable, with trust propensity

Trust has become an important topic of inquiry in a variety of
disciplines, including management, ethics, sociology, psychology,
and economics. Although this multidisciplinary perspective has
created a breadth that strengthens the trust literature (Bigley &
Pearce, 1998; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998), it also
has created confusion about the definition and conceptualization of
the trust construct. For example, some scholars view trust as a
behavioral intention (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998; Rousseau et al., 1998) or
an internal action, similar to choosing, judging, or preferring (e.g.,
Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Riker, 1971). Others view trust as synonymous with trustworthiness, discussing trust in the context of
personal characteristics that inspire positive expectations on the
part of other individuals (e.g., Butler & Cantrell, 1984; McKnight
et al., 1998). Still others view trust as a facet of personality that
develops early in life and remains relatively stable through adulthood (Rotter, 1967; Webb & Worchel, 1986). Finally, others treat
trust as a synonym for cooperation or risk taking (e.g., Kee &

defined as a stable individual difference that affects the likelihood
that a person will trust (see also Rotter, 1967; Stack, 1978).
Although the separation of trust, trustworthiness, and trust propensity has clarified the structure of the literature, five critical
questions remain unanswered. First, do all three facets of trustworthiness—ability, benevolence, and integrity— have significant,
unique relationships with trust, and how strong are those relationships? Second, does trust propensity remain important once trustworthiness can be gauged, or does its effect on trust disappear
when trustworthiness is controlled? Third, are trustworthiness and
trust propensity important only because they help inspire trust,
meaning that trust fully mediates their effects on relevant consequences? Fourth, how does the approach used to measure trust
alter its relationship with antecedents and consequences? Scholars
have used a number of approaches to measure trust (e.g., Cook &
Wall, 1980; Driscoll, 1978; Earley, 1986; Mayer & Davis, 1999;
Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974), and it remains unclear
whether the nomological network for trust varies across those
approaches. Fifth, do trust relationships vary according to whether
the trustee is a leader versus a coworker? Past research has drawn
a distinction between trust in leaders and trust in coworkers (Dirks
& Ferrin, 2002), yet Mayer et al.’s (1995) model is purported to be
equally relevant to either sort of trust referent.
The present study used meta-analytic structural equation modeling (Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995) to explore these five questions.
Although the trust literature previously has been the subject of a
meta-analysis, that review did not address these specific research
questions. Dirks and Ferrin (2002) meta-analyzed the results of 93
articles examining the antecedents (e.g., leadership style, participation in decision making) and consequences (e.g., organizational
commitment, job performance) of trust. Although their review
provided a useful and still timely quantitative summary of the
literature, their decisions about conceptualizing trust were not
necessarily made with Mayer et al.’s (1995) model in mind. As a
result, what they coded as trust often represented, in a Mayer et al.
sense, an amalgam of trust, ability, benevolence, and integrity.
This approach makes it difficult to estimate the relationships
between ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust and to explore
their unique relationships with outcomes. In addition, Dirks and
Ferrin’s review focused on trust in leaders, leaving open the
possibility that the antecedents and consequences of trust differ
from leader referents to coworker referents. Our article therefore
provides a useful complement to Dirks and Ferrin’s review by
exploring a different set of research questions.
In exploring the five aforementioned research questions, we
focused on two broad outcomes of trust: risk taking and job
performance. Recall that some scholars have equated trust with
behaviors that convey risk taking (e.g., Deutsch, 1958, 1960; Kee
& Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Zand, 1972). In Mayer et
al.’s (1995) formulation, the distinction between trust and risk
taking reflects the distinction between a willingness to be vulnerable and actually becoming vulnerable. Risk taking therefore
stands as the most proximal behavioral outcome or expression of
trust (Mayer et al., 1995; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). With respect to
job performance, trust is believed to affect the manner in which a
trustor allocates resources when interacting with the trustee (Dirks
& Ferrin, 2002; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). If a trustor is willing to be
vulnerable to leaders and colleagues, the trustor is free to focus full
attention on job tasks as opposed to diverting energy to monitor-

ing. Trust also allows the development of a more effective exchange relationship between the trustor and trustee (Blau, 1964),
which encourages more beneficial performance behaviors on the
job. Consistent with Rotundo and Sackett’s (2002) multidimensional model of job performance, we explored three specific performance facets: task performance (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993),
citizenship behavior (Smith, Organ, & Near, 1983), and counterproductive behavior (Sackett & DeVore, 2001).

Trust Antecedents: Trustworthiness and Trust Propensity
Trustworthiness
The definitions of trust offered by Mayer et al. (1995) and
Rousseau et al. (1998) both include an expectation that another
party will perform a particular action. One driver of that expectation is trustworthiness, as Lewis and Weigert (1985) noted:
First, trust is based on a cognitive process which discriminates among
persons and institutions that are trustworthy, distrusted, and unknown.
In this sense, we cognitively choose whom we will trust in which
respects and under which circumstances, and we base the choice on
what we take to be “good reasons,” constituting evidence of trustworthiness. (p. 970)

In the words of Flores and Solomon (1998), “In the ideal case,
one trusts someone because she is trustworthy, and one’s trustworthiness inspires trust” (p. 209). Clearly, then, the concept of
trustworthiness is central to understanding and predicting trust
levels.
Gabarro (1978) conducted a longitudinal study of how managers
develop working relationships with their subordinates. He conducted interviews with newly appointed managers over a 3-year
time period, focusing specifically on the “bases of trust” (p. 295).
One of those bases was competence or ability, which captures the
knowledge and skills needed to do a specific job along with the
interpersonal skills and general wisdom needed to succeed in an
organization (Gabarro, 1978). Ability has become one of the more
commonly discussed components of trustworthiness (Barber,
1983; Butler, 1991; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Gabarro, 1978; Kee
& Knox, 1970; Mayer et al., 1995). Another of those bases was
character, a multifaceted construct that subsumes concepts like
honesty, fairness, openness, caring motives and intentions, and
predictability. Mayer et al.’s model separates character into two
components. The first component is benevolence, defined as the
extent to which a trustee is believed to want to do good for the
trustor, apart from any profit motives, with synonyms including
loyalty, openness, caring, or supportiveness (Mayer et al., 1995).
The second component is integrity, defined as the extent to which
a trustee is believed to adhere to sound moral and ethical principles, with synonyms including fairness, justice, consistency, and
promise fulfillment.
Although the relevance of ability, benevolence, and integrity
may seem intuitive, it remains unclear whether each has a unique
impact on trust levels. It may be that either ability or character is
sufficient for fostering trust but that both are not needed. Although
that expectation seems reasonable, there are theoretical reasons to
expect ability and character to have unique relationships with trust.
First, ability captures the “can-do” component of trustworthiness
by describing whether the trustee has the skills and abilities needed

<-----Page 2----->TRUST, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND TRUST PROPENSITY

to act in an appropriate fashion. In contrast, the character variables
capture the “will-do” component of trustworthiness by describing
whether the trustee will choose to use those skills and abilities to
act in the best interest of the trustor. Such “can-do” and “will-do”
explanations for volitional behavior tend to exert effects independent of one another (e.g., Campbell, 1990).
It also may be that the effects of the two character facets—
benevolence and integrity—are redundant with each another. In
support of this notion, some studies using both variables have
failed to uncover significant, unique effects for both (Jarvenpaa,
Knoll, & Leidner, 1998; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). However, there
are theoretical reasons to expect benevolence and integrity to have
unique relationships with trust. Integrity represents a very rational
reason to trust someone, as a sense of fairness or moral character
provides the kind of long-term predictability that can help individuals cope with uncertainty (Lind, 2001). In contrast, benevolence can create an emotional attachment to the trustee, with caring
and supportiveness fostering a sense of positive affect. Trust
scholars have suggested that affect-based sources of trust can
supplement more cognition-based sources such as ability or integrity (Flores & Solomon, 1998; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998; Shapiro,
Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992; M. Williams, 2001). In summary,
our study provides the first meta-analytic summary of the relationships between ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust. We used
that meta-analytic data to test the following prediction:
Hypothesis 1a– c: The (a) ability, (b) benevolence, and (c)
integrity components of trustworthiness each have significant, unique relationships with trust.

Trust Propensity
Of course, decisions about trust must often be made before
enough time has passed to gather data on trustworthiness. Kee and
Knox (1970) argued that trust depends not just on past experience
but also on dispositional factors such as personality. Rotter (1967)
was among the first to discuss trust as a form of personality,
defining interpersonal trust as a generalized expectancy that the
words or promises of others can be relied on (see also Rosenberg,
1956; Rotter, 1971, 1980). This personality-based form of trust has
been referred to by other scholars as dispositional trust (Kramer,
1999), generalized trust (Stack, 1978), and trust propensity (Mayer
et al., 1995). McKnight et al. (1998) argued that trust propensity
has taken on a new importance as cross-functional teams, structural reorganizations, and joint ventures create new working relationships more frequently. After all, trust propensity is likely to be
the most relevant trust antecedent in contexts involving unfamiliar
actors (Bigley & Pearce, 1998).
However, an unanswered question is whether trust propensity
continues to impact trust once trustworthiness has been gauged.
Becker (1996) noted that trust should always be connected to
“good estimates of others’ trustworthiness” (p. 47). However,
Govier (1994) argued that trust propensity creates a filter that
alters interpretations of others’ actions. In this way, “observations
are theory-laden” (p. 244), retaining the impact of trust propensity
even after trustworthiness can be inferred. Lewis and Weigert
(1985) made a similar claim, arguing that information on trustworthiness

911

only opens the door to trust without actually constituting it. The
cognitive element in trust is characterized by a cognitive “leap”
beyond the expectations that reason and experience alone would
warrant—they simply serve as the platform from which the leap is
made. (p. 971)

Trust propensity may be the key driver of the form and shape of
that leap, affecting trust even in the presence of trustworthiness
information. We therefore used meta-analytic data to test the
following prediction:
Hypothesis 2: Trust propensity is positively related to trust,
controlling for ability, benevolence, and integrity.

Trust Consequences: Risk Taking and Job Performance
As noted earlier, Mayer et al.’s (1995) model casts trust as the
most proximal predictor of risk taking and related outcomes (see
also Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). Other models
view trust as a proximal antecedent of a variety of job performance
behaviors, including task performance, citizenship behavior, and
counterproductive behavior (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; G. R. Jones &
George, 1998; M. Williams, 2001). Many of those models also
predict that trust completely mediates the effects of trustworthiness
and trust propensity on those outcomes (Kee & Knox, 1970; Mayer
et al., 1995; Ross & LaCroix, 1996; M. Williams, 2001). From this
perspective, trustworthiness and trust propensity are important
only because they help inspire trust—they lack any unique or
independent effects on risk taking or job performance.
Although the full mediation view represents the consensus of
most trust models, that structure contradicts theorizing in the
literature on social exchange. Blau (1964) distinguished between
two types of exchange relationships: (a) economic exchanges,
which are contractual in nature and involve the exchange of exact
quantities specified in advance, and (b) social exchanges, which
involve the exchange of diffuse, future obligations that are vaguely
specified and occur over a more open-ended time frame. Consistent with Gouldner’s (1960) norm of reciprocity, the parties involved in social exchanges understand that a favor received in the
present creates an expectation of some repayment in the future. For
example, caring actions on the part of one exchange partner create
a sense of indebtedness on the part of the other, which may lead to
beneficial attitudes and behaviors directed toward the caring partner.
Trust concepts are a critical component of the social exchange
literature in two primary respects. First, the absence of any formal
contract or specified repayment schedule creates a built-in vulnerability, with one party risking the possibility that the other will fail
to meet obligations. As a result, social exchange relationships
cannot develop in the absence of trust (Blau, 1964). For this
reason, scholars sometimes use trust levels as an indicator of the
existence of a social exchange relationship (Aryee, Budhwar, &
Chen, 2002; Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Shore, Tetrick, Lynch, &
Barksdale, 2006). Second, many of the facets of trustworthiness
can be viewed as currencies that help create a social exchange. For
example, trustworthiness facets such as demonstrating concern and
support or acting based on sound principles can be viewed as
actions that should engender a motivation to reciprocate on the part
of an exchange partner. Thus, from a social exchange perspective,

<-----Page 3----->912

COLQUITT, SCOTT, AND LEPINE

trustworthiness inspires a social exchange relationship with trust
levels acting as one indicator of that relationship.
However, a number of other constructs also serve as indicators
of a social exchange relationship— constructs that could themselves act as mediators of trustworthiness– outcome relationships.
For example, Meyer and Allen (1997) distinguished between affective commitment, which reflects a desire to remain a member of
a collective because of an emotional attachment, and continuance
commitment, which reflects an attachment based in economic
investments and costs. Affective commitment indicates the existence of a social exchange relationship, whereas continuance commitment indicates the existence of an economic exchange relationship (Mowday, Porter, & Steers, 1982; Shore et al., 2006). A
number of other constructs also have been described as indicators
of social exchange relationships, including felt obligation, which
reflects the feeling that an individual owes the exchange partner a
maximum amount of energy and effort (Eisenberger, Armeli,
Rexwinkel, Lynch, & Rhoades, 2001), and psychological contract
fulfillment, which reflects the degree to which a party perceives
that their exchange partner has fulfilled promised obligations (Aselage & Eisenberger, 2003; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley,
Bolino, Lester, & Bloodgood, 2003). To the extent that trustworthiness predicts outcomes through the mechanisms of affective
commitment, felt obligation, psychological contract fulfillment,
and so forth, the mediating role of trust will only be partial. Our
review focuses specifically on the mediating role of affective
commitment given that it has been included in trust studies more
frequently than the other social exchange indicators.
Social exchange arguments also can be used to support direct
effects for trust propensity on outcomes, even when controlling for
trust. In his research on the construct, Rotter (1980) suggested that
individuals with a high trust propensity would themselves act more
trustworthy. That is, “high trustors” would exhibit a dispositional
tendency to act in a cooperative, prosocial, and moral manner
across contexts and across situations. Empirical research has
tended to support this claim, as higher scores on trust propensity
tend to be associated with increased honesty, increased compliance, increased help offering, and decreased cheating (Rotter,
1971, 1980; Stack, 1978; Webb & Worchel, 1986). These results
suggest that high trustors may be better at building social exchange
relationships because they are more prone to adhering to the norm
of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960) and are more likely to commit to
the long-term protection of the exchange relationship. If so, such
individuals should be capable of building a more expansive social
network that could bring them the information and support needed
to improve their decision making and performance (Burt, 1992;
Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997). We therefore used meta-analytic
data to test the following predictions regarding the mediating role
of trust:
Hypothesis 3a– c: The relationships between (a) ability, (b)
benevolence, (c) integrity, and risk taking and job performance are partially mediated by trust.
Hypothesis 4: The relationships between trust propensity and
risk taking and job performance are partially mediated by
trust.

Hypothesis 5a– c: The relationships between (a) ability, (b)
benevolence, (c) integrity, and risk taking and job performance are partially mediated by affective commitment.
Hypothesis 6: The relationships between trust propensity and
risk taking and job performance are partially mediated by
affective commitment.

Moderators of Trust Relationships
In the course of testing our hypotheses, our article provides a
meta-analytic summary of the relationships between trust, its antecedents (ability, integrity, benevolence, trust propensity), and its
consequences (risk taking, task performance, citizenship behavior,
counterproductive behavior). As noted earlier, many of these relationships have never been summarized in a meta-analytic review,
as Dirks and Ferrin (2002) did not include antecedents such as
ability or consequences such as risk taking and counterproductive
behavior. Our article also examines two moderators of trust effects: the nature of the trust measure and the referent used for trust
(i.e., leader vs. coworker).
With respect to trust measurement, we examine three types of
measures that have been used in assessing trust relationships.
Some scholars have used scales that focus on the positive expectations component of trust (e.g., Cook & Wall, 1980; Luo, 2002;
McAllister, 1995; Read, 1962; Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974). Other
scholars have relied on scales that focus on the willingness-to-bevulnerable component (e.g., Jarvenpaa et al., 1998; Mayer &
Davis, 1999; Mayer & Gavin, 2005). Still other scholars have used
measures that simply ask people to rate the extent to which they
“trust,” referred to here as direct measures (e.g., Ball, Trevino, &
Sims, 1993; Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997;
Driscoll, 1978; Earley, 1986). The degree to which these different
measures affect relationships with trust is unclear.
With respect to trust referent, some studies have focused on trust
in a direct leader or the general leadership of an organization (e.g.,
Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Kirkpatrick & Locke,
1996), whereas other studies have focused on trust in one or more
coworkers and colleagues (Luo, 2002; Tjosvold, Andrews, &
Struthers, 1991). Mayer et al. (1995) suggested that their integrative model of trust “is applicable to a relationship with another
identifiable party who is perceived to act and react with volition
toward the trustor” (p. 712). However, it remains an empirical
question whether trust relationships vary when that identifiable
party is leader based or coworker based.

Method
Literature Search
The first step in conducting the meta-analyses used to test our
hypotheses was the identification of relevant articles. We performed a literature search using the PsycINFO and Web of Science
databases using trust as the keyword. We also obtained relevant
paper presentations from recent scholarly meetings and performed
a Google search to look for unpublished working papers. To be
included in our meta-analyses, articles had to assess some trustrelevant variable (whether trustworthiness, trust propensity, or
trust itself) and involve an adult-age sample working in a taskfocused environment.

<-----Page 4----->TRUST, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND TRUST PROPENSITY

Our search uncovered 249 articles that explored a relationship
between a trust-relevant variable and at least one other antecedent
or consequence. We inspected those articles to ensure that they
possessed codable information, meaning that they contained some
zero-order effect size that could be translated into a correlation
coefficient. Such translations often involved F statistics or t statistics corresponding to zero-order effects, or mean and standard
deviation information across experimental conditions. However,
studies that included only partial or semipartial regression coefficients, or mean data without accompanying standard deviations,
were excluded. We also excluded studies that examined trust
relationships at higher levels of analysis using aggregate data (e.g.,
Jarvenpaa et al., 1998), as it may be inappropriate to combine those
data with individual level studies (Ostroff & Harrison, 1999).
These and other exclusions resulted in a final set of 119 articles
representing 132 independent samples. These articles are marked
in the References section by an asterisk.

Coding Procedures
Given the judgment calls inherent in meta-analyses, all coding
was performed by dyads formed from the study’s three authors.
When a disagreement arose, the author who was not part of the
dyad was brought in to discuss the coding question, though this
was rarely needed. We used the definitions, synonyms, and examples from Mayer et al.’s (1995) conceptual article and Mayer and
Davis’s (1999) trustworthiness measure to categorize each article’s
variables into the ability, benevolence, and integrity categories.
Table 1 summarizes this information. Variables were coded as
ability if they captured trustee skills or competencies. Specific
variables that were grouped into this coding category included
scales designed to assess ability, like, “competence,” “expertise,”
“knowledge,” and “talent” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Variables were
categorized as integrity if they referred to the trustee’s adherence
to sound moral and ethical principles. Specific variables that were

913

grouped into this coding category included scales designed to
assess integrity, like, “promise keeping,” “credibility,” and “procedural justice” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Procedural justice was
included because its focus on the consistency, bias suppression,
and ethicality of decision making (Leventhal, 1980) matches
Mayer et al.’s discussion of integrity as consistency of actions and
a strong sense of justice. Procedural justice concepts also are
included in three of Mayer and Davis’s integrity items. Variables
were coded as benevolence if they assessed the degree to which the
trustee wanted to do good for the trustor. Specific variables that
were grouped into this coding category included scales designed to
assess benevolence, like “openness,” “loyalty,” “concern,” and
“perceived support” (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Perceived support
was included because its focus on caring, valuing, showing concern, and helping the focal individual (Eisenberger et al., 2001)
matches Mayer et al.’s (1995) discussion of benevolence as caring
and receptivity. Perceived support concepts are also included in
four of Mayer and Davis’s benevolence items.
Variables were coded as trust propensity if they measured a
general tendency to trust others. The most commonly used measures of trust propensity included Rotter’s (1967) interpersonal
trust scale, Rosenberg’s (1956) faith-in-people scale, the trust facet
of the NEO PI–R Agreeableness scale (Costa & McCrae, 1992),
and Mayer and Davis’s (1999) trust propensity scale.
With respect to trust, several studies have used positive expectations measures with exemplar items like “How confident do you
feel that your superior keeps you fully and frankly informed about
things that might concern you?” (Read, 1962; see also Carson,
Madhok, Varman, & John, 2003; Clegg, Unsworth, Epitropaki, &
Parker, 2002; Cook & Wall, 1980, Peers subscale; Luo, 2002). For
the most part, these measures have assessed positive expectations
in reference to the actions and behaviors of the trustee. It is
important to note, however, that other positive expectations measures instead referenced expectations to the qualities and charac-

teristics of the trustee, thereby assessing ability, integrity, and
benevolence in addition to trust (e.g., Burgoon & Hale, 1987;
Cook & Wall, 1980, Management subscale; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996; Gabarro & Athos, 1976; McAllister, 1995; Mishra &
Mishra, 1994). These measures were classified by Dirks and Ferrin
(2002) as cognitive trust measures but had to be omitted from our
trust analyses so that linkages between ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust could be tested cleanly (though we did include
results for other relevant relationships from these articles). Other
studies have used willingness-to-be-vulnerable measures with exemplar items like “I would be comfortable giving top management
a task or problem which was critical to me, even if I could not
monitor their actions” (Mayer & Davis, 1999, taken from Schoorman et al., 1996; see also Davis et al., 2000; Mayer & Gavin,
2005; Moorman, Zaltman, & Deshpande, 1992). Still other studies
have used direct measures with exemplar items like “How much
trust do you place in your superiors?” (Earley, 1986; see also Ball
et al., 1993; Brockner et al., 1997; Driscoll, 1978; Hammer &
Berman, 1981; Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1996). Finally, some studies
have used measures that could not be categorized into any of the
three types because they blended item styles, whereas other studies
have used multiple trust scales. In the case of multiple scales, one
composite was formed for the overall analysis and the multiple
scales were included separately in the various breakdowns used to
compare results across measure types.
Variables were coded as risk taking if they referred to a specific
choice that created a behavioral manifestation of the willingness to
be vulnerable (Mayer et al., 1995; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). Specific variables that were grouped into this coding category included the decision to delegate an important task, the choice to
share information openly, the decision to avoid monitoring, the
rejection of safeguards, and the choice to defer to a trustee.
With respect to job performance, task performance variables
included objective indices of the fulfillment of job duties, along
with both supervisory and self-ratings. The citizenship behavior
variables included self-reports and reports by others of specific
citizenship behaviors (e.g., altruism– helping, conscientiousness–
compliance, sportsmanship, civic virtue, courtesy, voice) and more
general scales that tap a variety of behaviors (e.g., overall organizational citizenship behavior, or OCB, OCB–individual, OCB–
organizational; e.g., K. Lee & Allen, 2002; Podsakoff, MacKenzie,
Moorman, & Fetter, 1990; Van Dyne & LePine, 1998; L. J.
Williams & Anderson, 1991). The counterproductive behavior
variables included self-reports and reports by others of specific
counterproductive behaviors (e.g., disciplinary actions, making of
threats, disregard of safety procedures, tardiness, absenteeism) or
more general scales that tap a variety of behaviors (e.g., Bennett &
Robinson, 2000; Lehman & Simpson, 1992; Robinson & O’LearyKelly, 1998).
We also coded variables that indicate the existence of a social
exchange relationship in order to explore nontrust mediators of
trustworthiness and trust propensity effects. As expected, our
review indicated that constructs such as felt obligation and psychological contract fulfillment were not included in trust studies
with enough frequency to be included in our meta-analyses. Affective commitment was examined with enough frequency, with
the most common measures including Mowday, Steers, and Porter
(1979) and Allen and Meyer (1990).

Meta-Analytic Calculations
We followed Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) guidelines for metaanalysis. Our meta-analytic results include a weighted mean estimate of the study correlations (r), calculated by weighing each
study’s correlation by its sample size. The statistical significance
of those correlations is judged using a 95% confidence interval
constructed around the point estimate (Whitener, 1990). We also
report the value for those correlations after correcting for unreliability (rc). Those corrections were performed using the reliability
information provided in each article. For studies that did not report
reliability information, we used the weighted mean reliability
obtained from those studies that did report data for that variable.
In addition to providing calculations of uncorrected and corrected weighted mean correlations, meta-analysis can provide an
estimate of the variability in the correlations. Our results include
the standard deviation of the corrected meta-analytic correlation
(SDrc), which provides an index of the variation in study results for
a given relationship. We also report the percentage of variance
explained by artifacts (Vart), which captures the extent to which
variation in study results is caused by sampling error, unreliability,
and other study artifacts. In cases in which the variance explained
by artifacts is low, Hunter and Schmidt (2004) argued that moderator variables must be responsible for the variation in effect sizes
across studies. More specifically, Hunter and Schmidt suggested
that moderators are likely present if study artifacts fail to account
for 75% of the variance in the meta-analytic correlations.

Results
Meta-Analytic Summary of Trust Antecedents and
Consequences
Table 2 presents the meta-analytic results for the relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences. With respect
to the antecedents, ability (rc ⫽ .67), benevolence (rc ⫽ .63), and
integrity (rc ⫽ .62) were all strongly related to trust levels with
cumulative number of subjects ranging from 3,326 to 7,284. In
contrast, trust propensity (rc ⫽ .27) exhibited a more moderate
relationship with a cumulative number of subjects of 1,514. The
95% confidence intervals excluded zero for all four relationships.
With respect to the consequences, trust was moderately to strongly
related to risk taking (rc ⫽ .42, N ⫽ 1,384). Trust also was
moderately related to all three job performance dimensions: task
performance (rc ⫽ .33, N ⫽ 4,882), citizenship behavior (rc ⫽ .27,
N ⫽ 4,050), and counterproductive behavior (rc ⫽ –.33, N ⫽
2,088). Note that objective measures of task performance (rc ⫽
.31, N ⫽ 1,068) yielded similar results to supervisory ratings of
performance (rc ⫽ .30, N ⫽ 1,744) and self-ratings of performance
(rc ⫽ .36, N ⫽ 2,070). Other-rated versus self-rated assessment
also had little effect on the citizenship behavior results (rc ⫽ .23,
N ⫽ 2,002 for other rated; rc ⫽ .31, N ⫽ 2,048 for self-rated) and
the counterproductive behavior results (rc ⫽ –.29, N ⫽ 842 for
other rated; rc ⫽ –.35, N ⫽ 1,353 for self-rated).
Table 3 summarizes how the relationships between trust and its
antecedents and consequences vary by type of measure. The breakdowns suggest that the type of trust measure had little influence on
the magnitude of the trust relationships, as the 95% confidence
intervals overlapped in most cases. The exception was for direct

measures, where relationships with benevolence were somewhat
stronger and relationships with integrity were somewhat weaker.
Table 4 summarizes how the relationships between trust and its
antecedents and consequences vary by trust referent. The breakdowns suggest that trust referent had little influence on the magnitude of the trust relationships, as the 95% confidence intervals
overlapped in most cases. The exception was for the relationship
between integrity and trust, where leader referents resulted in
stronger correlations than coworker referents.

Tests of Hypotheses
Hypotheses 1a– c predicted that ability, benevolence, and integrity each have unique relationships with trust, controlling for one
another. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling was used to
test this hypothesis given that appropriate testing involves regression weights rather than zero-order correlations (Viswesvaran &
Ones, 1995). We first constructed the meta-analytic correlation
matrix shown in Table 5. Because the two moderators we examined, type of measure and trust referent, did not significantly
impact the trust correlations, we used the overall correlations in
constructing Table 5. We then entered that meta-analytic correlation matrix into a structural equation modeling analysis using
LISREL (Version 8.52; Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1996). Given that the
sample sizes differed across the various cells of the matrix, we
used the harmonic mean sample size to compute standard errors
(Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). The harmonic mean is calculated by
the formula [k/(1/N1 ⫹ 1/N2 ⫹ 䡠 䡠 䡠 ⫹ 1/Nk)], where N refers to
sample size and k refers to the total number of samples. Use of the
harmonic mean results in more conservative estimates, as less
weight is given to large samples. The left side of Figure 1 reveals
the results for Hypotheses 1a– c. All three coefficients were significant, supporting the hypotheses, with the ability relationship
(␤ ⫽ .39) and benevolence relationship (␤ ⫽ .26) moderate in
magnitude and the integrity relationship (␤ ⫽ .15) weaker in
magnitude.
Hypothesis 2 predicted that trust propensity is positively related
to trust, controlling for ability, benevolence, and integrity. The left
side of Figure 1 also reveals the result for this hypothesis. In
support of the hypothesis, trust propensity remained a significant
predictor of trust even when the trustworthiness forms were con-

sidered simultaneously. However, the magnitude of the relationship was relatively weak (␤ ⫽ .12).
Hypotheses 3a– c predicted that the relationships between ability, benevolence, integrity, and the outcomes are partially mediated
by trust. Hypothesis 4 made the same partial mediation prediction
for trust propensity. In testing these hypotheses, we compared the
fit of a full mediation model with a partial mediation model. The
full mediation model is shown in Figure 1, with the antecedent
relationships reviewed in the prior paragraphs supplemented by the
outcome relationships from Table 2. In testing the fit of the model
in Figure 1, we allowed the error terms for task performance,
citizenship behavior, and counterproductive behavior to covary in
order to reflect their common core of job performance (Rotundo &
Sackett, 2002). The results revealed an acceptable level of fit for
the full mediation structure, ␹2(19, N ⫽ 1,204) ⫽ 306.15, p ⬍
.001; CFI ⫽ .95; SRMR ⫽ .07. Acceptable model fit typically is
inferred when CFI is above .90 and SRMR is below .10 (Kline,
2005).
The partial mediation model is shown in Figure 2, which adds
direct paths between the four trust antecedents and the four outcomes. The error terms for task performance, citizenship behavior,
and counterproductive behavior again were allowed to covary. The
results revealed a better fit for the partial mediation structure, ␹2(3,
N ⫽ 1,204) ⫽ 120.60, p ⬍ .001; CFI ⫽ .98; SRMR ⫽ .05. The
significance of the improvement in model fit can be judged using
a chi-square difference test, and the difference in chi-square
(306.15 – 120.60 ⫽ 185.55) was statistically significant with (19
– 3 ⫽ 16) degrees of freedom ( p ⬍ .001). This improvement in fit
supports the view that trust is only a partial mediator of the
relationships between the trust antecedents and the outcomes.
Support for Hypotheses 3 and 4 also can be seen when examining the path coefficients in Figure 2. When risk taking was
regressed on trust and its antecedents simultaneously, trust remained a significant predictor (␤ ⫽ .25). However, ability (␤ ⫽
.12) and integrity (␤ ⫽ .15) had significant relationships independent of trust, illustrating that trust did not completely mediate their
effects. A similar pattern occurred for task performance. When
task performance was regressed on trust and its antecedents simultaneously, trust remained a significant predictor (␤ ⫽ .38). However, trust propensity (␤ ⫽ .07) and integrity (␤ ⫽ –.12) also had

smaller, unique relationships (note that the negative coefficient for
integrity may be an artifact of the high multicollinearity among the
trustworthiness facets). A similar pattern also occurred for counterproductive behavior. When counterproductive behavior was regressed on trust and its antecedents simultaneously, trust remained
a significant predictor (␤ ⫽ –.25). However, trust propensity (␤ ⫽
–.19), benevolence (␤ ⫽ –.10), and ability (␤ ⫽ .11) also had
smaller, unique relationships (note again that the positive coefficient for ability may be an artifact of high multicollinearity). Taken
together, these results reveal that trust mediates much, but not all,
of the relationships between the trust antecedents and those three
outcomes.
A different pattern of results is observed for citizenship behavior, however. When citizenship behavior was regressed on trust
and its antecedents simultaneously, trust remained a significant
predictor (␤ ⫽ .11). However, ability (␤ ⫽ .18) and trust propensity (␤ ⫽ .10) also had significant, unique relationships with
citizenship, and the magnitude of those relationships was similar to
(or slightly stronger than) the trust effect. This result suggests that

trust only mediates a fraction of the relationships between ability,
trust propensity, and citizenship behavior. In sum, our tests of
Hypotheses 3 and 4 suggest that trust does mediate the relationships between trustworthiness, trust propensity, and the outcomes,
but the mediation is only partial, as many of the antecedents
possessed unique relationships with the outcomes.
Hypotheses 5 and 6 entailed an attempt to explain that partial
mediation by examining affective commitment as another mediator of trustworthiness and trust propensity effects. Recall that trust
was expected to mediate the effects of those antecedents because
it serves as an indicator that a social exchange relationship has
developed. However, trust is not the only construct that indicates
a social exchange relationship, as affective commitment also
serves as evidence of such a relationship. Table 5 includes the
correlations between affective commitment and the other variables
in our models. Figure 3 depicts affective commitment as an additional mediator for trustworthiness and trust propensity effects. We
allowed the errors to covary for trust and affective commitment to
reflect a reciprocal association among the two social exchange

Discussion
Mayer et al.’s (1995) integrative model and Rousseau et al.’s
(1998) cross-discipline review helped clarify the conceptual distinctions among trust, trustworthiness, and trust propensity. Mayer
et al. also introduced a three-factor conceptualization of trustworthiness and cast trust as the most proximal predictor of risk taking
and other behavioral outcomes. Although the conceptual contributions of these articles are notable, a number of critical questions
remain a decade later. These questions center on the unique effects
of ability, benevolence, and integrity on trust; the mediating role of
trust in explaining the relationships between trustworthiness, trust

propensity, and behavioral outcomes; and the effects of trust
measurement and trust referent on relationships with antecedents
and consequences. Although the trust literature previously has
been subject to a meta-analysis, Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) review
did not speak to these specific questions because their conceptualization of trust was an aggregate of trust and trustworthiness in
a Mayer et al. sense. In addition, their review focused specifically
on leader-based referents and did not include variables such as
ability and risk taking. Our meta-analyses therefore complement
Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) review, and our results offer a number of
theoretical, measurement, and practical implications.

Theoretical Implications
Lewis and Weigert (1985) suggested that trust is based on
“‘good reasons’ constituting evidence of trustworthiness” (p. 970).
Although Mayer et al. (1995) defined those “good reasons” in
terms of ability, benevolence, and integrity, some studies have
failed to demonstrate significant, unique effects for all three dimensions when predicting trust (Jarvenpaa et al., 1998; Mayer &
Gavin, 2005), and the trustworthiness dimensions often are highly
correlated. Moreover, some conceptualizations of trustworthiness
combine benevolence and integrity into a single character variable
(Gabarro, 1978), suggesting that those two dimensions might be
redundant with each other. Our results support the importance of
all three trustworthiness dimensions, as all three had significant,

unique relationships with trust. One explanation for those unique
relationships may be that the trustworthiness dimensions reflect
both cognition-based and affect-based sources of trust (Flores &
Solomon, 1998; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewis & Weigert, 1985;
McAllister, 1995, 1997; Rousseau et al., 1998; Shapiro et al.,
1992). For example, a cognitive calculation of the skills, capabilities, values, and principles of the trustee (in the forms of ability
and integrity) may be supplemented by a more affective acknowledgment of the mutual concern inherent in the relationship (in the
form of benevolence).
Of course, trust often requires a leap beyond the expectations
that ability, benevolence, and integrity can inspire (Lewis &
Weigert, 1985). Trust propensity may drive that leap (Mayer et al.,
1995; Rosenberg, 1956; Rotter, 1967; Stack, 1978), as our results
showed that propensity was related to trust on both a zero-order
basis and when trustworthiness was considered simultaneously. It
also is worth noting that propensity was significantly related to all
three trustworthiness facets. If propensity were to be viewed as an
antecedent of trustworthiness perceptions (by changing the curved
arrows in the figures into direct paths to ability, benevolence, and
integrity), it would have significant indirect effects on trust to go
along with its significant direct effect. That sort of structure is
consistent with some models in the literature (Kee & Knox, 1970;
McKnight et al., 1998; Ross & LaCroix, 1996) and matches
Govier’s (1994) view that “observations are theory-laden,” with
trusting parties perceiving more good reasons to trust (p. 244).
In addition to exploring trust antecedents, our study examined
the specific behaviors that trust can be used to predict. Most
important, we tested Mayer et al.’s (1995) fundamental assumption
that trust fosters risk taking—that an intention to accept vulnerability actually results in a decision to become vulnerable (see also
Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). Our results revealed
moderately strong relationships between trust and risk taking.
Moreover, our results revealed moderately strong relationships
between trust and the three facets of job performance, as individuals who are willing to trust others tend to engage in better task
performance, perform more citizenship behaviors, and commit
fewer counterproductive behaviors. Taken together, these sorts of
results reinforce the view that trust is a vital component of effective working relationships (Lind, 2001; Tyler & Lind, 1992).
Our results also showed that trust benefits relationships with
both leaders and coworkers. On the one hand, Mayer et al.’s (1995)
integrative model de-emphasized the importance of different kinds
of trust referents, focusing instead on any identifiable party who
acts with volition toward the trustor. On the other hand, scholars
have treated trust in leadership as a distinct phenomenon, as
evidenced by Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) exclusive focus on trust in
leadership. Our results showed that, in general, the relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences did not vary
across leader-based and coworker-based referents. The one exception was the relationship between integrity and trust, which was
significantly stronger for leader-based referents. It may be that
issues of fairness, consistency, promise fulfillment, and so forth
are more salient in relationships with an obvious power differential.
Finally, our study explored the question “Are trustworthiness
and trust propensity important only because they inspire trust?”
Mayer et al. (1995) suggested that trust completely mediates the
relationships between trustworthiness or trust propensity and out-

<-----Page 10----->TRUST, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND TRUST PROPENSITY

comes (see also Kee & Knox, 1970; Ross & LaCroix, 1996; M.
Williams, 2001). Our results suggest that trustworthiness and trust
propensity may be important even aside from their trust-fostering
role, in two respects. First, ability, benevolence, integrity, and trust
propensity had significant, unique relationships with behavioral
outcomes even when trust was considered simultaneously. For
example, integrity had incremental effects on risk taking, and
benevolence had incremental effects on counterproductive behaviors. Ability had incremental effects on both risk taking and
citizenship behavior, and trust propensity had incremental effects
on both citizenship behavior and counterproductive behavior.
Second, ability, benevolence, and integrity were significant predictors of affective commitment, not just trust. We had reasoned
that trustworthiness and trust propensity might have independent
relationships with the outcomes when controlling for trust because
they can engender a social exchange relationship. Trust can act as
a partial indicator of that social exchange relationship (Aryee et al.,
2002; Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Shore et al., 2006), but other
constructs—like affective commitment— can serve a similar function (Mowday et al., 1982; Shore et al., 2006). Our results showed
that affective commitment was a significant predictor of citizenship behavior and counterproductive behavior when controlling for
trust. From this perspective, trustworthiness may have a dual
importance—predicting behaviors through the mechanisms of both
trust and affective commitment.
Although affective commitment provided an additional mediator for the effects of trustworthiness and trust propensity, it must be
noted that the trust antecedents had incremental effects on the
outcomes even when both mediators were controlled. We suspect
these remaining direct effects point to the importance of still other
social exchange indicators, such as felt obligation (Eisenberger et

al., 2001) and psychological contract fulfillment (Aselage &
Eisenberger, 2003; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Turnley et al.,
2003). Unfortunately, these indicators have not been included in
trust studies with enough frequency to be included in our analyses,
though both offer useful directions for future research. Alternatively, it may be that demonstrating complete mediation for trustworthiness and trust propensity requires a more comprehensive or
direct approach to operationalizing the social exchange phenomenon. For example, Shore et al. (2006) validated a scale that
reflects multiple facets of social exchange relationships, including
the trust within the relationship, the investment between the two
parties, the duration of the exchange, and the socioemotional (as
opposed to financial) focus of the exchange. It may be that this sort
of measure would fully mediate trustworthiness and trust propensity effects because the full spectrum of exchange concepts is
being captured.

Measurement Implications
In addition to the theoretical implications we have described,
our article has a number of implications for measurement within
the trust literature. For example, our results revealed high intercorrelations between the ability, benevolence, and integrity dimensions. Although the three dimensions still had significant, unique
relationships with trust and affective commitment, such high intercorrelations could lead to unstable regression weights, particularly in primary studies with modest sample sizes. Indeed, we
suspect that the multicollinearity among the ability, benevolence,
and integrity dimensions was responsible for the small regression
weights in Figures 2 and 3 that were opposite in sign from the
zero-order correlations. Mayer et al. (1995) provided compelling

<-----Page 11----->920

conceptual evidence for the distinctions among the three trustworthiness factors. It may be that those conceptual distinctions are
more difficult to maintain in the minds of survey respondents who
fill out scales like Mayer and Davis’s (1999). Alternatively, it may
be that there is overlap between the trustworthiness dimensions
that could be clarified further at both a conceptual and operational
level. For example, demonstrating caring and concern is a facet of
benevolence, whereas a strong sense of justice is a facet of integrity (Mayer & Davis, 1999; Mayer et al., 1995). However, scholars
in the organizational justice literature view caring and concern as
a facet of “interactional justice” (Bies & Moag, 1986), suggesting
a blurring of the benevolence–integrity boundary.
Other measurement implications can be derived from our analyses of trust measurement approach as a moderator of trust relationships. Specifically, our results showed that the relationships
between trust and its antecedents and consequences did not vary
significantly across measures based on the positive expectations or
willingness-to-be-vulnerable components of trust definitions
(Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998) or across direct measures that explicitly use the word trust. The fact that measurement
approach did not appear to be a significant moderator suggests that
it may not matter in what sense one trusts. There are two reasons
why that contention should be viewed with caution, however. First,
we had to exclude some commonly used trust measures from our
review because they explicitly measured positive expectations in
reference to ability, benevolence, or integrity rather than the ac-

tions of the trustee (e.g., Burgoon & Hale, 1987; Cook & Wall,
1980, Management subscale; Cummings & Bromiley, 1996;
Gabarro & Athos, 1976; McAllister, 1995; Mishra & Mishra,
1994). Second, the most rigorous test of trust measurement effects
would involve including positive expectations, willingness to be
vulnerable, and direct measures in a single study to see how their
zero-order and unique relationships differ from one another. Unfortunately, the inclusion of multiple types of scales in a single
study remains extremely rare.

Limitations
This study has some limitations that should be noted. First, like
any meta-analysis, it subsumes the limitations of the studies on
which it is built. For example, many of the studies included in our
review yielded correlations that could have been inflated by samesource bias, inflation that also would impact our meta-analytic
correlations. Similarly, many of the studies included in our review
used a cross-sectional correlational design, preventing us from
establishing causal direction in our analyses. This limitation is
particularly relevant to our mediation analyses, given that the term
mediation presumes a specific causal direction (Stone-Romero &
Rosopa, 2004). Also, our analyses examined only the main effects
of trustworthiness, trust propensity, and trust. Mayer et al.’s (1995)
model argued that trust propensity could moderate the effects of
trustworthiness on trust. Unfortunately, meta-analytic structural

relationship; I ⫽ integrity relationship; Counterprod. ⫽ counterproductive. N ⫽ 1,319. *p ⬍ .05.

equation modeling is ill suited to examining such effects because
it requires the reporting of zero-order effect sizes in the studies.
Authors would need to report the zero-order correlations with
moderated regression product terms in order for interactive effects
to be explored.

Suggestions for Future Research
Despite these limitations, our quantitative review offers a number of suggestions for future research. For example, trust scholars
have neglected to examine whether the importance of the three
trustworthiness facets varies across jobs. Ability may be a stronger
predictor in jobs that require frequent learning or technical competence (Schmidt & Hunter, 2000). Benevolence and integrity may
be stronger predictors in jobs where task interdependence necessitates frequent interactions (Wageman, 2001). Although our review could not test those specific suggestions, we did explore
breakdowns of the trustworthiness–trust relationships for the field
studies included in our review using manufacturing, service, and
managerial job categories. The number of studies in those breakdowns proved to be too small to draw any firm conclusions, but
some differences do seem worthy of further investigation. For
example, ability seemed to be a more significant predictor of trust
in manufacturing jobs than in managerial jobs, with service jobs
only appearing in a single study (r ⫽ .64 [.57, .70], k ⫽ 2, N ⫽ 415
for manufacturing; r ⫽ .41 [.28, .54], k ⫽ 3, N ⫽ 284 for
managerial; r ⫽ .56 [.48, .64], k ⫽ 1, N ⫽ 381 for service).

Similarly, benevolence seemed to be a more significant predictor
of trust in manufacturing and service jobs than in managerial jobs
(r ⫽ .62 [.56, .68], k ⫽ 3, N ⫽ 493 for manufacturing; r ⫽ .29 [.09,
.49], k ⫽ 2, N ⫽ 175 for managerial; r ⫽ .46 [.40, .52], k ⫽ 3, N ⫽
897 for service).
In contrast to the ability and benevolence results, integrity
seemed to be a more significant predictor of trust in managerial
and service jobs than in manufacturing jobs (r ⫽ .30 [.21, .29], k ⫽
7, N ⫽ 1,793 for manufacturing; r ⫽ .65 [.49, .81], k ⫽ 2, N ⫽ 141
for managerial; r ⫽ .62 [.57, .66], k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 899 for service). The
result for managerial jobs complements our finding that the
integrity–trust relationship was significantly stronger for leaderbased trust referents than for coworker-based trust referents (see
Table 4). It seems that the qualities associated with integrity, such
as reliability, promise fulfillment, and fairness, become even more
important in cases in which authority dynamics are particularly
salient. Lind (2001) argued that issues such as fairness and ethicality are especially critical in authority-based contexts because
the risk of exploitation is apparent. Future research should attempt
to replicate the integrity effects reported here while identifying the
mechanisms that could explain such differences.
Other suggestions for future research center on how employees
react to trust in multiple authorities. As Mayer and Gavin (2005)
illustrated in their study of trust in plant managers and top management teams, employees trust multiple authorities at a given
time. Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) review revealed that trust in one’s

<-----Page 13----->922

COLQUITT, SCOTT, AND LEPINE

direct leader had a stronger effect on task performance and citizenship behavior than trust in organizational leadership. Our results show a similar pattern for citizenship behavior, though the
number of studies is too small to identify significant differences
(r ⫽ .24 [.20, .28], k ⫽ 10, N ⫽ 2,651 for direct leader; r ⫽ .13
[.01, .25], k ⫽ 2, N ⫽ 351 for organizational leadership). However,
our breakdowns for task performance (r ⫽ .19 [.14, .25], k ⫽ 12,
N ⫽ 1,979 for direct leader; r ⫽ .31 [.22, .41], k ⫽ 4, N ⫽ 516 for
organizational leadership), risk taking (r ⫽ .23 [.06, .39], k ⫽ 4,
N ⫽ 222 for direct leader; r ⫽ .35 [.15, .54], k ⫽ 2, N ⫽ 173 for
organizational leadership), and counterproductive behavior (r ⫽
–.25 [–.31, –.20], k ⫽ 7, N ⫽ 1,253 for direct leader; r ⫽ –.36
[–.87, .15], k ⫽ 1, N ⫽ 104 for organizational leadership) revealed
the opposite pattern, with trust in organizational leadership more
strongly related to these outcomes, though the confidence intervals
overlapped in all cases. Future research should continue to explore
such differences while also examining the unique effects of multiple trust referents on employee reactions.

Practical Implications
Our article also offers a number of practical implications. First
and foremost, our results underscore the practical benefits of
fostering trust in the workplace. The relationship between trust and
job performance was as strong as or stronger than relationships
with other attitudes such as job satisfaction (Judge, Thoreson,
Bono, & Patton, 2001). Trust also predicted risk taking, which is
vital in many jobs where formal or legalistic controls do not
protect exchange partners (Hardin, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
Trust also predicted counterproductive behaviors, which can prove
quite costly to organizations even when the base rates for committing them remain low (Sackett & DeVore, 2001). In addition,
trust was positively correlated with affective commitment, a significant predictor of both absenteeism and turnover (Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, & Topolnytsky, 2002).
Given the importance of trust to key organizational outcomes,
our trustworthiness results can provide a guide for increasing trust
in organizations. Ability, benevolence, and integrity provide three
distinct avenues for fostering trust, as all three were highly correlated with trust and all three had significant, unique relationships
with it. The ability results reinforce the importance of recruitment
and selection strategies geared toward maximizing general abilities
and training strategies targeted at building task-specific expertise
(Arthur, Bennett, Edens, & Bell, 2003; Rynes, 1991). With respect
to benevolence and integrity, coworker-based relationships could
benefit from building such content into team-building programs.
Although the long-term benefits of such programs are open to
debate (Salas, Rozell, Mullen, & Driskell, 1999), their effectiveness may be enhanced if they are focused specifically on trustworthiness antecedents. Leader-based relationships potentially could
benefit from incorporating trustworthiness drivers into leader
training. Skarlicki and Latham (1996) demonstrated that leaders
could be trained to act in a more fair and ethical manner. Training
geared toward improving the facets of integrity could be particularly effective given the importance of integrity in leader-based
relationships.
