■ Abstract The study of affect in the workplace began and peaked in the 1930s, with
the decades that followed up to the 1990s not being particularly fertile. Whereas job
satisfaction generally continues to be loosely but not carefully thought of and measured
as an affective state, critical work in the 1990s has raised serious questions about the
affective status of job satisfaction in terms of its causes as well as its definition and
measurement. Recent research has focused on the production of moods and emotions at
work, with an emphasis, at least conceptually, on stressful events, leaders, work groups,
physical settings, and rewards/punishment. Other recent research has addressed the
consequences of workers’ feelings, in particular, a variety of performance outcomes
(e.g., helping behaviors and creativity). Even though recent interest in affect in the
workplace has been intense, many theoretical and methodological opportunities and
challenges remain.

INTRODUCTION
The organizations in which people work affect their thoughts, feelings, and actions in the workplace and away from it. Likewise, people’s thoughts, feelings,
and actions affect the organizations in which they work. Organizational behavior
is an area of inquiry concerned with both sorts of influence: work organizations on
people and people on work organizations. The slice of the organizational behavior
literature this paper addresses has to do with the feelings of workers, how organizations affect them and how they affect organizations. As should become clear in
the following section, we choose to focus on the affective dimensions of organizational behavior because, after a lapse of more than half a century, organizational
researchers have begun to demonstrate a serious interest in moods and emotions
in the workplace.
The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows. First, the study of workers’
feelings is placed in a historical context and, thereby, the boundaries of the chapter
are delineated further. Second, the affective status of the job satisfaction construct is
assessed very briefly. Third, recent literature pertaining to the production of moods
and emotions in the workplace is reviewed, followed by a survey of the effects of
moods and emotions experienced in the workplace. Finally, conceptual concerns
about workers’ feelings not adequately addressed in the organizational literature are raised, and suggestions for how to approach these concerns methodologically are provided. Overall, the intents of the paper are to appraise what is known
about affective experiences in organizational settings, to highlight existing gaps in
the literature, and to suggest how those gaps might be filled.

THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT

The Rich 1930s and the Leaner Years
The study of affect at work clearly emerged as a scientific research concern in the
1930s, principally in the United States; this likely was made possible by earlier
developments that philosophically justified the application of scientific principles to the study of social phenomenon, that supplied the methodological tools
necessary to conduct such research, and that created the perceived need for understanding workers’ feelings in the minds of those who managed them. Examples
of now-classic studies from this period that focused on affect per se or job satisfaction include Fisher & Hanna’s (1931) The Dissatisfied Worker, Kornhauser
& Sharp’s (1932) “Employee attitudes; suggestions from a study in a factory,”
Hersey’s (1932) Workers’ Emotions in Shop and Home: A Study of Individual
Workers from the Psychological and Physiological Standpoint, Hoppock’s (1935)
Job Satisfaction, and Roethlisberger & Dickson’s (1939) Management and the
Worker.
The 1930s were exciting times for the study of affect at work, characterized
by innovation and discovery as well as a diversity of ideas and methods. For instance, Fisher & Hanna (1931), relying on the findings of a number of case studies,
characterized job dissatisfaction as the product of “nonadjustive emotional tendencies” whose associated unrest is misattributed by workers to their job situations.
Kornhauser & Sharp (1932) conducted an attitude survey of Kimberly Clark employees, supplemented by interviews, and concluded that “efficiency ratings of
employees showed no relationship to their attitudes” (p. 402). Hersey (1932), using a repeated measures design with a small group of skilled workers, observed,
among many other things, a clear relationship between daily affect levels and daily
performance levels as well as considerable influence of workers’ emotional lives
at home on their work behaviors. Hoppock (1935), using surveys and interviews
of workers in one community (New Hope, Pennsylvania) and in one occupation
(teachers), in part found elements of the work environment (e.g., supervision),
family expectations, and “emotional maladjustment,” all to influence job satisfaction. Roethlisberger & Dickson (1939), based upon a series of studies using a
variety of methods in the Hawthorne plant of AT&T’s Western Electric division,
concluded, for instance, that the workplace’s social organization and the individual’s interaction with that organization, more than individual differences per se,
determined worker adjustment.
The diversity evident in the 1930s soon faded and was replaced by an approach
that was conceptually and methodologically narrow. This approach entailed (a)
construing of affect at work almost exclusively in terms of job satisfaction; (b)
measuring constructs of interest with structured questionnaires, largely ignoring,
for instance, more clinical or qualitative methods; (c) focusing on empirical observables to such an extent that adequate attention to theory building too often was
excluded; and (d ) examining the facets of the work environment as causes of job

satisfaction while generally neglecting dispositional and extra-work factors such
as family and economic circumstances.
Whereas one could speculate on the causes of this narrowing [e.g., the reliance
on questionnaires may have been attributable to developments in the measurement
of attitudes, and the almost exclusive concern with work environment causes of
job satisfaction might have been due to the desire of industrial psychologists to
aid management in controlling the workplace (Baritz 1960)], here we address
only the results of the narrowing (for more details on the 1930s, see Weiss & Brief
2002). For almost the next half century one workplace event, condition, or outcome
after another was correlated with pencil-and-paper measures of job satisfaction,
typically not guided by a well-articulated theoretical frame of reference, yielding
well in excess of 10,000 studies (Spector 1996)! We will review that literature
here; for such reviews see, for example, Locke (1976) and Spector (1997). In the
next section, however, we do take a brief look at job satisfaction but only through
an affective lens, considering recent approaches that recognize that job satisfaction
does not equal affect.

The Hot 1990s
In the mid-1980s and the 1990s, organizational researchers rediscovered affect,
expressing interest in both moods and emotions. Here, “moods” are considered
to be generalized feeling states that are not typically identified with a particular
stimulus and not sufficiently intense to interrupt ongoing thought processes (e.g.,
Clark & Isen 1982, Thayer 1989); alternatively, “emotions” normally are associated
with specific events or occurrences and are intense enough to disrupt thought
processes (e.g., Frijda 1993, Simon 1982; for a review of the emotions literature,
see Zajonc 1998). Moreover, whereas moods often [but not always (e.g., Russell &
Barrett 1999)] are described in terms of their underlying dimensions (e.g., positive
and negative) (e.g., Watson 2000), emotions tend to be treated in their discrete forms
(e.g., anger, fear, and joy) (e.g., Plutchik 1994). This review focuses on research
in organizations on such moods and emotions. Why such research re-emerged as
an area of inquiry in organizational behavior is not known, but it likely had a lot
to do with the seemingly intense interests moods and emotions were (and are)
attracting generally in psychology (e.g., the American Psychological Association
launched a new journal, Emotion, in 2001). Whatever the cause, there now exists
a contemporary literature concerned with affective experiences in organizational
settings, to which we now turn.

THE AFFECTIVE STATUS OF JOB SATISFACTION
Definitional Concerns
In 1976, Locke advanced what came to be a highly influential definition of job
satisfaction. He defined it as “a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting

from the appraisal of one’s job or job experiences” (p. 1300). Thus, job satisfaction
came to be considered an affective reaction to one’s job. Almost a decade later
Organ & Near (1985) recognized that job satisfaction has a cognitive as well as an
affective dimension and questioned the extent to which commonly used measures
of the construct capture both (also see Pekrun & Frese 1992, Sandelands 1988).
Brief & Roberson (1989) empirically explored the affective and cognitive content
of three commonly used measures of job satisfaction. They observed that only
the Faces scale (Kunin 1955) captured the affective and cognitive components
about equally and that the other two highly popular measures investigated mostly
tapped the cognitive components. Thus, Brief & Roberson discovered a paradox
that remains troublesome today: Job satisfaction generally is construed in affective
terms, but typically only its cognitive aspects are measured (also see Porac 1987).
Progress towards a more balanced treatment of job satisfaction, at least conceptually, was made during the 1990s. Motowidlo (1996) defined self-reports of
job satisfaction as “judgments about the favorability of the work environment”
(p. 176) (also see Pratkanis & Turner 1994). Consistently, but more explicitly,
adopting a construal of job satisfaction as an attitude, Weiss (2002) defined it as
“a positive (or negative) evaluative judgment one makes about one’s job or job
situation” (p. 6). Perhaps most closely aligned with the attitude construct is Brief’s
(1998) definition. Based on Eagly & Chaiken’s (1993) assertion that an attitude is
“a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with
some degree of favor or disfavor,” with “evaluating” referring to “all classes of
evaluative responding, whether overt or covert, cognitive, affective, or behavioral”
(p. 1), he defined job satisfaction as “an internal state that is expressed by affectively and/or cognitively evaluating an experienced job with some degree of favor
or disfavor” (p. 86). Brief, like Bagozzi & Burnkrant (1979), as well as others,
excluded evaluative responses of the behavioral type because they often are treated
as dependent effects of the attitude.
The distinction between job satisfaction as an evaluative judgment and as an
attitude with affective as well as cognitive components is not trivial. For example,
Weiss (2002, Weiss & Cropanzano 1996) asserted that affective experiences on
the job are a cause of job satisfaction (construed as an evaluative judgment);
Weiss et al. (1999a) have demonstrated empirically this is so (also see Fisher
2000, Kelloway et al. 1993). It also has been asserted that self-reported affect
at work [for example, as gauged by Burke and associates’ (1989) Job Affect
Scale] is an indicator of the affective component of job satisfaction; Moorman
(1993), consistent with the reasoning for instance of Millar & Tesser (1986), has
shown that so-called affective- and cognitive-based measures of job satisfaction
differentially predict the same criterion. He found a cognitive-based measure to
predict “organizational citizenship behaviors” (e.g., Organ 1988) better than an
affective-based measure of job satisfaction. Thus, it appears that job satisfaction
may be approached productively in at least two ways: (a) If job satisfaction is taken
as an evaluative judgment, then affect at work can be seen as an antecedent to it, and
(b) if job satisfaction is taken to have an affective component, then affect at work

can be seen to be an indicator of it. Researchers, in the future, should recognize
explicitly that these approaches, while distinctive, may not be in conflict (i.e.,
moods and emotions experienced on the job may be both a cause of job attitudes
and an indicator of them) and that each has its own merits.
Regarding the merits of the “affect as a cause approach,” for example as advanced in affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano 1996), it draws much
needed attention to streams of events that can unfold in workplaces and that generate emotional reactions or mood changes. Regarding the merits of the “affect as
indicator approach,” it, for example, encourages one to consider the components
of job satisfaction and how they might be related to consequent behaviors that
may be more affectively than cognitively driven or vice versa. Either approach
indicates that job satisfaction’s affective status was elevated in such a way during
the 1990s that it no longer should be acceptable to define job satisfaction one way
(affectively) and blindly measure it another (cognitively).

Dispositional Influences
Another way the affective status of job satisfaction has been elevated in recent
years is by the recognition that it is influenced by “affective dispositions” (e.g.,
Judge 1992) or, more precisely, by personality traits that have been labeled temperaments (Watson 2000). These traits are neuroticism [or negative affectivity (NA)]
and extraversion [or positive affectivity (PA)], both components of the five-factor
model of personality (e.g., Watson & Clark 1992), with individuals high in the
former prone to experience a diverse array of negative mood states (e.g., anxiety,
depression, hostility, and guilt) and individuals high in the latter prone to describe
themselves as cheerful, enthusiastic, confident, active, and energetic. Organizational interest in these traits stems from Staw and associates’ (1986) attentiongrabbing demonstration that affective disposition gauged when participants were
15 to 18 years of age correlated significantly (r = 0.35 p ≤ 0.01) with a measure
of job satisfaction taken when the participants ranged from about 54 to 62 years of
age. Although Staw et al.’s results and dispositional interpretations have not gone
uncriticized (e.g., Davis-Blake & Pfeffer 1996, Williams et al. 1996), detected
relationships between negative and/or positive affectivity and job satisfaction now
are commonplace in the literature (e.g., Agho et al. 1992; Cropanzano et al. 1993;
Necowitz & Roznowski 1994; Schaubroeck et al. 1992, 1998; Watson & Slack
1993). Various explanations for these empirical observations have been advanced
(Arvey et al. 1991, House et al. 1996, Judge 1992); recent examples of these are
presented below.
Following the lead of Schmitt & Bedeian (1982), Watson & Slack (1993),
reasoned that job satisfaction and general temperament mutually influence one
another. That is, affective dispositions broadly influence the extent to which people
are satisfied with and derive pleasure from their jobs (as well as other aspects of
their lives), and because job satisfaction is an important life domain, it may lead
to more general life satisfaction and better emotional adjustment (i.e., higher trait

positive affect and lower trait negative affect). To our knowledge, such a reciprocal
relationship remains to be tested.
Drawing on the “instrumental” and “temperamental” views described by
McCrae & Costa (1991), Brief et al. (1995) reasoned that high NA individuals
(a) because of their tendency to dwell on failures and shortcomings of themselves
and others, may alienate their co-workers and managers, resulting in more negative interpersonal interactions, thus lowering job satisfaction (also see Burke et al.
1993) and (b) because they are more sensitive to negative stimuli, may react with
more extreme emotion when experiencing negative job events, thus lowering job
satisfaction (also see Parkes 1990). Brief et al. also posited that high NA individuals might respond with diminished pleasure when experiencing positive job
events. They attributed such a possibility to high NA individuals (a) having a higher
threshold for positive stimuli, (b) having a lower-magnitude positive mood reaction
to positive events, and/or (c) experiencing the effects of positive mood–inducing
events for shorter periods of time than those low in NA. Brief et al., in a field
experiment, did observe an interaction between NA and a positive mood induction
such that the induction had less of an effect on job satisfaction among individuals
high in NA. This observed interaction, however, could have been attributable to
any or all of the three underlying mechanisms they posited.
After Weiss & Cropanzano (1996), Weiss et al. (1999a), as noted earlier, hypothesized that global satisfaction judgments are, in part, a function of “true affective
experiences at work or ‘the preponderance of pleasant affect’ over time” (p. 4); they
supported this prediction with daily accounts of mood-at-work data. Moreover,
Weiss et al. hypothesized and observed that “dispositional happiness” predicts “average state levels of pleasant-unpleasant mood at work over the course of the mood
assessment period” (p. 5). Their results are consistent with a personality–mood at
work–job satisfaction causal chain. Brief (1998), in his integrated model of job satisfaction, proposed a somewhat different causal chain: personality–interpretations
of job circumstances–job satisfaction, with “interpretations” referring “to how a
person construes or apprehends the objective circumstances of his or her job”
(p. 96). Whereas one could empirically pit one model against the other, it appears
more reasonable to consider that temperaments influence job satisfaction through
both mood at work and interpretations of job circumstances, recognizing that
moods and interpretations are unlikely to be independent.
Shaw et al. (1999) creatively pursued Larsen & Ketalaar’s (1989) assertion that
PA and NA represent reward-signal sensitivity and punishment-signal sensitivity, respectively. They argued that not all elements of job satisfaction evolve both
sensitivities; in particular, pay evokes reward sensitivity only. Moreover, Shaw
et al. hypothesized and, to a considerable degree, empirically demonstrated that
NA is unrelated to pay satisfaction and that PA is associated with it; additionally, PA interacted with actual salary level to predict some dimensions of pay
satisfaction. The form of the interactions, as predicted, indicated that low PA individuals are much more satisfied with high rather than low pay relative to high PA
individuals.

Whereas it is clear that temperaments can influence job satisfaction, the processes by which this happens are not yet well understood. It appears that personality
operates through multiple channels to affect job satisfaction, and different elements
of job satisfaction may be differentially affected by the same affective trait. Whatever mechanisms may be discovered, the affective status of job satisfaction has
been elevated merely by the repeated demonstration that affective dispositional
traits such as NA and PA (along with environmental stimuli) are associated with
job satisfaction.

Summary
In a knee-jerk fashion, job satisfaction generally continues to be loosely but not
carefully thought of as an affective reaction and to be measured in ways that
have been assumed, largely uncritically for decades, to tap how workers feel.
In the 1990s, however, the construct began to be examined closely in affective
terms. Moods and emotions experienced at work have been shown to influence job
satisfaction. Can these same moods and emotions also be taken as indicators of
job satisfaction? Should job satisfaction be construed as an evaluative judgment or
as an attitude with affective and cognitive components? Job satisfaction has been
shown to be influenced by temperaments. What are the processes that underlie these
relationships? Do these processes vary by the focal job element being evaluated
(e.g., pay versus job security)? We have seen the beginnings of a change in the way
the relationship between affect and job satisfaction is construed. Whether or not
it fully materializes depends on how vigorously answers to the sorts of questions
posed here are pursued and, more importantly, the extent to which as yet unasked
questions about the affective status of job satisfaction are advanced in ways that
capture the interests of researchers.

THE PRODUCTION OF MOODS AND EMOTIONS
IN THE WORKPLACE
Exogenous Factors
Obviously, the feelings people experience at work may have been produced elsewhere (e.g., marital problems at home may spill over and affect how one feels at
work) (e.g., Hersey 1932). Such carryover states, although important for understanding behaviors in organizations, are not of concern here; rather, this section
focuses on factors in the workplace that influence the feelings experienced there.
Also exogenous to the workplace and, thus, not the focus of attention are two factors
worthy of mention, for they have been considered in the organizational literature:
(a) diurnal and other recurring cycles in feelings over time and (b) dispositional
influences on affective states.
Cycles in feelings (i.e., moods) can arise from rhythms related to lifestyle,
to sociocultural factors, and to biological factors (e.g., Watson 2000). Weiss et al.
(1999a) have conducted perhaps the only modern study designed to examine mood

cycles at work. Based upon affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano 1996),
they expected and observed in a sample of 24 middle managers that mood cycles
at work do exist and that individuals differ in their cycles of pleasantness and
activation at work. Weiss et al. recognized that “the causes and consequences of
these differences remain to be explored,” and that more generally, “it is important to
emphasize that identifying these cycles is not the same as explaining them” (p. 21).
In the previous sections, we addressed, albeit rather briefly, historical interest
in the dispositional basis of affect at work and contemporary concern with dispositional approaches to job satisfaction. Consistent with these observations, we note
that, in the 1990s, statistically significant correlations between NA and workplaceexperienced depressed mood, anxiety, and other indicators of negative affect were
commonplace (e.g., Fortunato et al. 1999, George et al. 1993, Hart et al. 1995,
Heinisch & Jex 1997, Schaubroeck et al. 1992, Spector & O’Connell 1994). Typically, these correlations were found in investigations appearing in the job stress
literature, in which it is well known that personality plays multiple, influential
roles in stress and coping processes whose outcomes often are construed in terms
of affect (e.g., George & Brief 2001, Lazarus & Cohen-Charash 2001). George’s
(1990) demonstration that characteristic levels of the personality traits of PA and
NA, within work groups, are positively associated with their corresponding (positive and negative) affective tones. George’s (e.g., 1996) work takes affect up to a
more aggregate level of analysis with its focus on “group affective tone,” which she
defines as “consistent or homogenous affective reactions within a group” (p. 78).

Stressful Events/Conditions at Work
Conceptually at least, workplace endogenous factors that produce moods and emotions have been grouped into several not necessarily mutually exclusive categories
(e.g., George 1996, George & Brief 1992, Weiss & Cropanzano 1996). Examples of
these categories include stressful events (or aversive stimuli), leaders, workgroup
characteristics, physical settings, and organizational rewards and punishments. We
begin by considering stressful events. The job-related stress literature is massive
(with at least one journal, Work & Stress, exclusively devoted to the topic), populated by a diversity of theoretical orientations (e.g., Cooper 1998), and too often
methodologically muddled (e.g., Hurrell et al. 1998). Because the focus of this
chapter is on affect, not job stress per se, we provide examples only of those stress
studies that explicitly examined affect. Several studies in the 1990s sought to ascertain if NA is a nuisance in the analysis of job stress because it inflates relationships
between self-reports of stressors and strains (e.g., Schaubroeck et al. 1992). These
studies, while providing evidence of personality-affect linkages, otherwise have
contributed little to understanding the production of moods and emotions at work.
The attention focused on NA by job stress researchers may have distracted from efforts aimed at systematically identifying those events/conditions in the workplace
associated with negative feelings. It is time to move on.
Signs of the direction of that movement are evident. In an experience sampling
study of employed mothers, Williams et al. (1991) observed that self-reported

multiple role juggling (i.e., simultaneously attending to demands of different roles)
had immediate negative effects on mood; however, habituation to role juggling
occurred when mood was examined over time. Moreover, Williams & Alliger
(1994), in an experience sampling study of employed parents, found that unpleasant
mood spilled over from family to work but pleasant moods had little spillover.
(For a conceptual treatment of juggling and emotions, see Wharton & Erickson
1993.) George et al. (1993) observed that the extent of a nurses’ exposure to
AIDS patients, as part of the nursing role, is positively associated with negative
mood at work and that this relationship is moderated by organizational and social
support. Hart et al. (1995), among a sample of police officers, found that selfreports of emotion-focused coping with work events was associated with more
negative job experiences, which, in turn, were associated with more negative and
less positive affect. The most important negative job experiences were shown to be
organizationally related (e.g., dealing with administration and supervision) rather
than operationally related (e.g., dealing with victims and danger). Zohar (1999),
using pooled-time series analysis on daily records of a sample of military parachute
trainers, observed that daily occupational hassle severity, measured independently
by an expert, predicted end-of-day negative mood. Teuchmann et al. (1999), using
an experience sampling methodology with a small sample of accountants, found
self-reported time pressure to be associated with negative mood and that perceived
control may alleviate this negative effect.
The above six studies exemplify what we believe to be good and bad about
what appears to be emerging in the job stress literature pertaining to moods and
emotions. On the positive side, the literature seems to be advancing methodologically, with the increased use of experience sampling resulting in less reliance on
cross-sectional designs that make inferences about process hazardous. Substantially, on the positive side, with physically threatening conditions of work (e.g.,
AIDS) being considered, an interest in the social environment at work as a source
of distress is being placed in a more proper perspective; that is, threats to physical
well-being are beginning to receive the attention they deserve.
On the negative side, several substantive concerns are evident: Discrete emotions tend not to be the focus of study; economic events/conditions have not taken
their appropriate place alongside social and physical factors as potential job stressors; and, consistently, the search for potential job stressors is not guided by a
widely accepted theoretical frame of reference or even a small set of competitive
theories—rather, each empirical investigation seems to be driven by a somewhat
unique theoretical orientation. Thus, the job stress literature has yielded relatively
little, in a cumulative sense, toward understanding the production of moods and
emotions in the workplace, and without theoretical guidance, it is unlikely to do so.

Leaders
Leaders, in various ways, have been theorized to affect how their followers feel
(e.g., George 2000). For example, George (1996), following George & Brief

(1992), asserted, “Leaders who feel excited, enthusiastic, and energetic themselves
are likely to similarly energize their followers, as are leaders who feel distressed
and hostile likely to negatively activate their followers” (p. 84). This idea clearly
is evident in the transformational leadership literature, in which the claim is made
that these types of leaders use strong emotions to arouse similar feelings in their
audiences (e.g., Conger & Kanungo 1998); others have reasoned that managers
can foster and shape the arousal of their subordinates through the use of symbols
(e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey 1995). Some recent evidence does support the role
of leaders in the production of moods and emotions. Fitness (2000), for instance,
observed that what angered people depended upon their organizational position.
For lower-power workers (e.g., followers), anger was a product of unjust treatment by higher-power workers (e.g., leaders). If the offenses from above involved
humiliation, low-power workers experienced moderate to high levels of hate for
offenders. Lewis (2000b), in a laboratory study, found that followers observing a
leader expressing anger felt more nervous and less relaxed than followers observing a leader expressing sadness or no emotion. In addition, she found that followers
observing a leader expressing sadness felt less enthusiasm and more fatigue then
followers observing a leader expressing anger or no emotion. Although results like
these are interesting, it is clear that the organizational literature is populated with
many more ideas about the leader’s role in the production of moods and emotions
than it is with relevant data.

Work Group Characteristics
Preliminary research suggests that work groups commonly have consistent or homogeneous affective reactions (e.g., George 1990, 1995; conceptually, also see
Barsade & Gibson 1998, Sandelands & St. Clair 1993; for counter-evidence, see
Barsade et al. 2000); as was noted above, this “group affective tone” is influenced
by characteristic levels of personality traits within groups. These characteristic
levels of personality have been theorized to be brought about by member similarity resulting from attraction-selection-attrition processes described by Schneider
(1987, George 1990). Beyond personality, a number of other factors have been
posited to explain why work group members tend to share moods and emotions
(e.g., Bartel & Saavedra 2000, George 1996, George & Brief 1992), for example,
(a) common socialization experiences and common social influences (Hackman
1992); (b) similarity of tasks and high task interdependence (see Gallupe et al.
1991, Heath & Jourden 1997 on group task activity per se); (c) membership stability; (d) mood regulation norms and rules [see, e.g., the literature on emotional
labor (e.g., Sutton 1991)]; and (d) after Hatfield et al. (1994), emotional contagion
(see Pugh 2001 for a study of emotional contagion from employees to customers).
Regarding these work group characteristics, we again observe that ideas far outstrip data. The following examples of recent studies do demonstrate considerable
promise, however. Totterdell et al. (1998) showed, in two studies (with community nurses and accountants), that people’s moods are influenced by the collective

mood of their co-workers over time. Moreover, for the nurses, this result was not
dependent on common daily hassles, but was, for instance, on age (with a greater
association for older nurses) and commitment to teams (with a greater association
for more committed nurses). In a follow-up study of two professional cricket teams,
Totterdell (2000) found, with pooled time-series analyses, significant associations
between the average of teammates’ happy moods and the players’ own moods.
In addition, these results were independent of hassles and favorable standing in
the match and, like Totterdell et al., dependent on player age and commitment
to the team. Bartel & Saavedra (2000), based upon a study of 70 work groups,
found convergence between observers’ reports and self-report indicators of eight
distinct mood categories, with the weakest relationships detected for mood categories characterized by low arousal. Convergence in members’ mood increased
with task and social interdependence, membership stability, and mood regulation
norms. We hope the research by Bartel & Saavedra and by Totterdell and his
colleagues will help provide the impetus for more research on how work group
characteristics affect the production of moods and emotions.

Physical Settings
Very little is known about how physical settings, even broadly construed, affect
feelings in the workplace. Oldham et al. (1995) used a quasi-experimental design
to observe that music improved the mood states of workers and that this effect
was stronger for workers performing relatively simple jobs. Also addressing job
complexity were Spector & Jex (1991), who observed that incumbent (but not
independent) ratings of job characteristics were associated with anxiety and frustration, leading them to urge caution in the use of incumbent self-reports of job
characteristics as indicators of actual work environments. This warning seems not
to have been heeded by Saavedra & Kwun (2000), who found, in their sample of
managers, that self-reports of job characteristics were related to both independent
assessments of activated pleasant and unpleasant affect and went on to treat these
results as if they entailed job characteristics, by addressing the implications of
them for the actual design of managerial work in their discussion.
A few other studies exemplify what can be considered as falling into the physical setting domain. Rafaeli & Sutton (1990), using structured observations of 194
transactions between cashiers and customers in 5 supermarkets, found store busyness to be related negatively to cashiers’ displayed positive emotion, and customer
demand (i.e., the extent to which a transaction required a prolonged and complex
cashier response) to be related positively to displayed positive emotions. Of course,
one must question the degree to which such displayed emotions are congruent with
those felt. Locke (1996) provides another example of the study of the “emotional
labor” (e.g., Hochschild 1983) process, which concerns the production of displayed feelings. During a year-long study in a pediatric department, she observed
the interplay between emotions expressed by patients and their families and those
expressed by physicians. Locke found that physicians tended to enact comedic

performances in response to families’ negative emotions, presumably to display
and generate fun, which is incompatible with the anxiety, fear, and despondence
patients’ families may bring to medical encounters.
As a final example, Wasserman et al. (2000; also see, e.g., Strati 1992, 1996;
White 1996), drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, demonstrated links
between the aesthetics of physical cues or symbols in organizations (restaurants
and bars) and the emotions felt by potential participants. For instance, research
participants reacting to photographs of eclectically designed establishments reported largely pleasant emotions, whereas the reactions to monomorphic designs
were considerably more mixed.
In sum, recent organizational research on the relationship between the properties of physical settings and the experience of mood and emotions has been slim
and characterized by highly varied theoretical and methodological orientations;
little knowledge has accumulated. Obvious properties like temperature, noise, and
lighting appear to have been ignored, at least recently, in the organizational literature [for a glimpse of the literature on physical settings outside the organizational
arena, see, for example, Sundstrom et al. (1996).]

Organizational Rewards/Punishments
The final category of factors we previously identified as theorized to produce moods
and emotions is organizational rewards and punishments. Surprisingly, given their
potential import (e.g., Brief & Aldag 1994), we found very few empirical studies
in the 1990s and beyond in the organizational literature that addressed linkages
between rewards/punishments and workers’ feelings. What we did isolate was
research that adopted a justice frame of reference (e.g., Folger & Cropanzano
1998, Greenberg 1990). For example, Weiss et al. (1999b) found that happiness was
influenced by outcomes, with procedural fairness playing little role; alternatively,
guilt, anger, and, to a lesser extent, pride were influenced by specific combinations
of outcomes and procedures (also see Bies 2001, Bies & Tripp 2001; see Miller
2001 for a more general treatment of the topic). Whereas these results, because of
their provocative nature, suggest that a justice orientation to understanding affective
reactions to organizational rewards/punishments is worthwhile, it is most clear that
rewards/punishments from an affect standpoint largely have been ignored. This sad
state of affairs likely will be best corrected by pursuing multitheoretical avenues,
justice being one of them.

Summary
The above treatment of the literature by the categories we identified should not
be taken as encompassing all existing approaches to understanding the production
of moods and emotions in the workplace. Other, more isolated approaches do
exist. For example, we found papers that compared the moods of unemployed and
unsatisfactory employed young adults over time (Winefield et al. 1991) and that
theorized about the causes of jealousy and envy at work (Vecchio 1995). Even

though our review of the recent organizational literature was not comprehensive,
several observations appear warranted.
First, personality as a determinant of workplace moods (but not workplace emotions) seems relatively well established; how attributes of the workplace might
interact with personality to affect feelings has been approached too narrowly,
theoretically, and empirically. Second, in the job stress literature, threats to physical well-being as a source of negative moods and emotions are beginning to draw
needed attention; however, as is characteristic of the job stress literature in general,
this research has not been conducted with the intent of developing a meta-theory
of job stress—a framework to guide the search for those conditions of work likely
to produce negative moods and emotions. Third, empirical research on how leaders may affect the feelings of their followers is embryonic; however, it exhibits
tremendous promise on theoretical grounds. Fourth, perhaps the most exciting
new area of research is that pertaining to group affective tone. Available theory is
provocative, and the few empirical results now available generally are supportive
of the ideas that have been advanced to explain how work group members come
to share their feelings. Fifth, research on affective reactions to the physical work
environment is small and eclectic, but interesting. Research that recognizes that
customers/clients/patients can be construed as mood and emotion generators and
that focuses on the mood and emotional consequences of the workplace aesthetics
(including music) seems to be especially intriguing. Sixth, virtually no progress has
been made in the past decade toward understanding the effects of organizational
rewards and punishments on how workers feel. Finally, the research reviewed here
admirably often relied upon longitudinal designs that could allow for the study
of process (i.e., how the production of moods and emotions unfolds); however,
rarely did studies include objective indicators of those workplace features thought
to produce moods and emotions, thereby leaving us too dependent on self-reports,
which may not be congruent with more independent measures of the workplace and
may, themselves, be influenced by the feelings workers experience (the dependent
variables of interest).
In closing, for the past ten years or more, organizational researchers have raised
many more questions than they have answered about the production of moods and
emotions. We interpret this state of affairs opportunistically, as a beginning or,
in light of our earlier historical analysis, as a rebirth. After considering below the
consequences of workers’ feeling, we turn to gaps in the literature in need of filling;
thus, the production of moods and emotions will surface again.

CONSEQUENCES OF MOODS AND EMOTIONS
IN THE WORKPLACE
Conceptual Orientations
In the past decade several conceptual discussions of affect appeared that focused
either on the organizational consequences of affective states or traits or included

discussions of consequences within broader discussions of mood and emotion
at work. Stimulated partly by these organizationally focused conceptual pieces
and partly by more basic research, empirical work appeared demonstrating the
attitudinal or behavioral consequences of affect at work. Among the conceptual
pieces published, three stand out. Isen & Baron (1991) presented a wide-ranging
discussion of the potential effects of positive affect on a variety of work-relevant
attitudes, behaviors, and cognitive processes. Their discussion is notable for its effort to connect organizational issues to basic research on mood, particularly Isen’s
(1987, 1999, 2000) body of work on positive affect. At the same time, its exclusive
focus on positive affect makes it less useful for understanding the effects of negative
mood states or discrete emotions. George & Brief (1992) examined the relationship between affective states and what they called “organizational spontaneity,” a
variant on what has come to be known as extra-role or organizational citizenship
behaviors. They argued that mood at work is a proximal cause of spontaneity and
that individual mood is, in turn, influenced by individual mood-generating factors
both on and off the job as well as group affective tone.
Weiss & Cropanzano (1996) presented a broad discussion of the consequences
of affective states and traits at work. Of particular interest is their distinction
between affect-driven and judgment-driven behaviors. According to Weiss &
Cropanzano, affect-driven behaviors are relatively immediate behavioral and cognitive outcomes of affective states. These effects generally are bounded in time
and unmediated by overall evaluative judgments about jobs as a whole or elements of the job experience. Judgment-driven behaviors are outcomes influenced
by overall or particular evaluative judgments such as job or facet satisfaction. They
further argued that some satisfaction-outcome relationships reported in the literature may be the spurious result of affective states influencing both satisfaction and
the particular outcome in question.

Judgments
Most organizational research closely follows findings from the basic research
literature on the behavioral and cognitive effects of affective states, particularly
moods. That organizational research shows, as we demonstrate, that affective states
can influence a variety of performance-relevant outcomes including judgments,
attitudinal responses, creativity, helping behavior, and risk taking. We begin by
considering judgments.
The effects of affect on judgments have been studied in a number of ways.
DeNisi and his associates (Robbins & DeNisi 1994, 1998; Varma et al. 1996)
examined the relationship between what they referred to as “interpersonal affect”
and performance evaluations. Similar research by Judge & Ferris (1993) examined supervisor liking for a subordinate and supervisor ratings of the subordinate’s
performance. In aggregate, these kinds of studies showed interpersonal affect and
liking to be related to both performance ratings and certain intervening cognitive processes. However, as measured, interpersonal affect and liking seem more
assessments of attitudes held toward a subordinate than assessments of any real

affective experiences with the subordinate or affective responses to the subordinate. As such, these studies do demonstrate that attitudinal consistency can bias
performance judgments, but provide less clarity regarding affective influences on
appraisals.
In an interesting twist on the affect-performance evaluation relationship, Fried
et al. (1999) examined the relationship between NA and deliberate rating inflation. They argued that raters high on NA would generally produce higher ratings than raters low on NA, through such automatic processes as biased recall.
The consequence of these automatic distortions is that high NA raters would
have less room or inclination to deliberately inflate their ratings and, therefore,
more inflation would be seen among raters low in NA. Whereas Fried et al.
did not measure distortion per se, their results did show that NA was positively
correlated with self-reports of distortion and that this relationship was moderated by the extent to which supervisors were required to document subordinates’ work behaviors and the extent to which appraisals were visible among
peers.
Other performance-relevant judgments have been shown to be influenced by
affect. Saavedra & Earley (1991) showed that self-efficacy was higher among
subjects exposed to a positive affect manipulation than it was among subjects
exposed to a negative affect manipulation. Unfortunately, the absence of a neutral affect control group precludes the ability to determine whether positive affect
enhances efficacy, negative affect reduces efficacy, or both. Brief et al. (1995)
had two groups of employees complete a typical job satisfaction measure. One
group was put in a positive mood by the receipt of small gifts. The other group
served as a control. Employees in a positive mood reported higher levels of job
satisfaction than did employees in the control group. Note that this may be a
demonstration of the biasing effects of immediate mood on judgment, rather
than of the substantive influence of work-relevant affect on the formation of job
attitudes.

Creative Problem Solving
A longstanding laboratory finding is that being in a positive mood can enhance
creative problem solving (Isen 1999). This relationship has been tested in the field:
Estrada et al. (1997) showed that physicians placed in a positive mood scored better
on a test of creativity. Madjar et al. (2001) demonstrated that positive mood, but not
negative mood, predicted on the job ratings of creativity and mediated the effects
of social support on creativity ratings.

Helping Behaviors
A substantial body of social psychological research has shown that being in a
positive mood state generally encourages the display of helping behavior and cooperation and reduces aggression (Isen & Baron 1991). The clear relevance of
cooperative, prosocial behaviors to organizations has produced a lot of research

examining affect and various forms of helping behavior at work. In a series of
studies, George looked at the relationship between positive mood at both individual (George 1991) and group (George 1990, George & Bettenhausen 1990)
levels, with prosocial behavior directed at both co-workers and customers. George
(1991) found that a self-report of positive mood in the previous week predicted
supervisor ratings of altruism on the job and customer service. Moreover, it did so
after controlling for beliefs about justice and fairness in the workplace and more
dispositional measures of affect. George (1990) found that the negative group affective tone was associated with the level of prosocial behaviors in the group;
George & Bettenhausen (1990) found that a leader’s positive mood predicted
group members’ self-reports of customer service behavior.

General Performance
Staw and his colleagues’ (Staw & Barsade 1993, Staw et al. 1994, Wright &
Staw 1999) research is notable for its thoughtful explication of affect processes
that may influence performance. Some of these processes, as the Staw group
notes, suggest conflicting predictions about the effects of positive and negative
affective states. So, for example, research indicates that positive affective states
facilitate creativity and efficacy judgments whereas other research suggests that
negative affective states can lead to more thorough canvassing of problem solutions
and more accurate judgments. By and large, Staw and his colleagues’ research
demonstrates a performance facilitation of positive rather than negative affect. For
instance, Staw & Barsade (1993) showed facilitative effects of positive affect on
decision quality and interpersonal performance, as well as more general indicators
of performance.

Negotiations
The negotiation context, with its emphasis on the receipt of favorable or unfavorable outcomes and its opportunity for interpersonal conflict, should be a natural
setting for the study of affect. Somewhat surprisingly, few studies of true affect in
negotiations context have been conducted (Barry & Oliver 1996, Thompson et al.
1999). Those studies mostly have focused on negotiator tactics and generally find
that positive affect enhances cooperation and the search for creative solutions (see,
e.g., Baron 1990, Forgas 1998, Pruitt & Carnevale 1993) as well as confidence in
being able to achieve positive outcomes (Baron 1990, Kramer et al. 1993). Additionally, Pillutla & Murnighan (1996) have opened up a new line of research
focused more on discrete emotions than general affective states. They find that
anger reactions can lead negotiators to reject offers that are in their best interests
as judged by pure economic standards. Recent conceptual treatments of affect in
negotiation processes (e.g., Barry & Oliver 1996, George et al. 1998, Kumar 1997,
Thompson, et al. 1999), as well as Pillutla & Murnighan’s work on anger, should
stimulate more research in this area.

Withdrawal Behaviors
In 1989, George showed that positive, but not negative, moods predicted absenteeism and that positive and negative moods predicted turnover intentions. Research on affect, both state and trait, and withdrawal continued in the 1990s.
Cropanzano et al. (1993) argued that commitment was the consequence of affective experiences at work, and because negative affectivity (NA) and positive
affectivity (PA) influence emotional reactivity, both traits should predict turnover
intentions as mediated by commitment. In two studies they found that NA and PA
correlated with turnover intentions, with commitment mediating the effect of PA
in both studies and NA in one. George & Jones (1996) examined the interactive
effects of values, positive moods, and satisfaction in predicting turnover intentions
and found that positive mood predicted turnover intentions both in isolation and
interacting with satisfaction and value fulfillment. In a longitudinal field study,
Pelled & Xin (1999) showed that both positive and negative mood at work predicted subsequent absenteeism, although positive mood was more influential. In
contrast, only negative mood states predicted subsequent turnover. In the aggregate, these studies all point to the importance of examining affective experiences
when studying withdrawal behaviors, although the somewhat conflicting findings
regarding positive and negative states indicate a need for more research on the
processes that explain these effects.

Summary
It seems fair to say that examinations of the performance consequences of affect have been characterized by somewhat more sophisticated discussions of process than have traditional examinations of satisfaction-performance relationships.
Much of the affect research has been well grounded in basic research, particularly
that pertaining to the behavioral and judgment consequences of mood states. Specific affect studies have been as likely to focus on specific performance–related
behaviors or judgments (e.g., creativity, goal persistence, and helping behavior)
as on general performance assessments. Overall, thus far, the results appear more
positive than what the field has been used to with job satisfaction. That being said,
there have been certain limitations to the research on outcomes of affective states,
which are addressed below.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The Narrowness of Organizational Research
The study of affect across psychology is wide-ranging in terms of its research
programs: the problems identified, the methods used in seeking solutions to those
problems, and the tentative solutions that have been produced. The study of affect
in organizations is narrow in its problems and methods. That narrowness could be

considered appropriate if it was the consequence of a thoughtful examination of
the breadth of basic research followed by a series of judgments about what is and is
not relevant to understanding behavior in organizations. Unfortunately, that does
not appear to be the reason for the discrepancy. Our goal in this section is not to
review basic research on moods and emotions. Rather, we wish to highlight some
of the ways in which we believe organizational research has been overly narrow
and point to directions for broadening research activities.
Perhaps the most glaring example of the narrowness of organizational research
is the overemphasis of the study of mood at the expense of discrete emotions.
Research on dispositional affect examines tendencies to experience positive or
negative mood states over time. Research on the determinants of affect looks at
the way leaders, work environments, or stress influence mood states. Research on
the consequences of affect looks at the effects of positive mood states on creativity or helping behavior. Certainly, counterexamples can be found [for example,
research on anger (Allred et al. 1997, Fitness 2000, Glomb & Hulin 1997, Pillutla
& Murnighan 1996) or the discrete emotional consequences of justice conditions
(Weiss et al. 1999b)], but the overwhelming emphasis is on mood states.
A number of reasons can be offered for this imbalance. First, the groundbreaking work of Isen (e.g., 1987) provided a compelling framework for examining
the consequences of positive mood states on performance-relevant organizational
behaviors. Perhaps no other program of basic research on affect has been as influential for organizational scholars as Isen’s. Of equal importance has been the ready
availability of measures of mood, particularly measures of positive and negative
affect. That is, much of the organizational research on the consequences of affect
has used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al. 1988)
or modifications of it (e.g., Burke et al. 1989) as the measurement instrument
and Isen’s work as the theoretical framework, likely resulting in narrower than
desirable methodological and theoretical orientations.
This imbalance in studies of mood and discrete emotions is unfortunate for two
reasons. First, an enormous amount of research on emotions has accumulated, and
this research highlights processes and outcomes of clear relevance to individual
functioning in work settings. Second, it is apparent that discrete emotions are
important, frequently occurring elements of everyday experience. Even at work—
perhaps especially at work—people feel angry, happy, guilty, jealous, proud, etc.
Neither the experiences themselves, nor their consequences, can be subsumed
easily under a simple structure of positive or negative states.
The research on discrete emotions is diverse. Evolutionarily influenced psychologists have looked at the universality of basic emotions, including characteristic response patterns as well as the functional value of emotional displays (e.g.,
Cosmides & Tooby 2000, Fridlund 1994, Izard 1997, Keltner & Ekman 2000).
This research can inform studies of emotional contagion and group affective tone
and the behavioral and performance consequences of emotional states. Cognitively
influenced psychologists examine the appraisal processes that generate emotional
states (e.g., Clore & Ortony 2000, Dalgleish & Power 1999, Lazarus 1991). This

research can inform the study of emotion generating working conditions and emotional climates. Research programs on particular emotions such as anger, or what
have been referred to as “self-conscious emotions” (guilt, shame, pride) (Lewis
2000a), can inform understanding of how these particular emotions play out in
organizational contexts. We hope the next few years will see a shift in emphasis
to balance the interest in moods with an interest in discrete emotions.
Dispositional affect research in organizational behavior also has been dominated by PA and NA. Measures of PA or NA have been controlled for in stress
research and have been correlated with satisfaction and performance and mood
states. As we already have noted, in all of this research very little empirical work
has been done on the processes by which dispositional affect influences various
outcomes. More importantly, there has been little connection between organizational research on dispositional affect and the burgeoning research on the physiology of affect concerning the delineation of multiple affective systems (e.g.,
Cacioppo et al. 1999, Davidson 1992, Gray 1994) and the development of alternative measures of dispositional affect tied to those systems (Avila 2001, Carver
& White 1994). That research points to two systems that control reactivity for
positive and negative events. Although these systems are approximately consistent with the PA/NA structure, they are not entirely so. In addition, they suggest
more precise ways of examining affective dispositions and may provide for better
understanding of how those dispositions operate to produce immediate affective
states.

A Process Orientation
Although we asserted that affect-outcome process discussions are more sophisticated than typical satisfaction-outcome process discussions of the past, it is still
true that these process analyses can and need to be even more sophisticated. Current
research is driven by particular criteria. That is, researchers lay out the important
dimensions of performance, look to see what the basic literature says about affect
influencing those dimensions, and then demonstrate in the work setting the particular relationship. For example, positive affect enhances helping, so why not show
that positive affect at work enhances helping at work? This is a perfectly reasonable
activity, both theoretically and practically, and serves as a first step in the study of
affect-performance relationships.
What has received less attention, but ultimately may be more useful, is research
that is less focused on particular performance dimensions and more focused on
broader affect processes. For example, people engage in emotional regulation.
These regulatory activities can deplete resources necessary for task performance
(Muraven & Baumeister 2000). In a very interesting study, Richards & Gross
(1999) showed that attempts to suppress the display of emotional states, a common
requirement in many organizations, impaired memory for information encountered
during the period of suppression. Similarly, rumination about emotional events can
interfere with performance (Mikulincer 1996), and there are measurable individual

differences in rumination tendencies (Sarason et al. 1996a). Of course, because
people are just as likely to ruminate about positive as negative events, significant
emotional events of either valence may negatively impede performance. Such
possibilities, derived from a process orientation, have yet to be considered in the
organizational literature.
A process orientation requires a better grasp of the state-trait distinction. Few
organizational studies have focused on the immediate consequences of momentary affective states, yet many of the outcome processes described in the literature are relatively immediate and time bound. A number of studies have used
extended time frames of a week or more (e.g., George 1991, George & Jones
1996, Madjar et al. 2001) to gauge affect at work; even more troublesome, others ask about mood at work but leave the time frame unspecified (e.g., Pelled &
Xin 1999). Often, the justification is that moods can be long lasting (hours or
days); however, moods also can be rather short lived, fluctuating dramatically over
a single day. In addition, although some researchers attempt to use the PANAS
structure for state affect, it is not clear that this positive/negative structure is appropriate for describing momentary mood states. Overall, the extent to which
these methods adequately operationalize time- and situation-bound processes is
unknown.
Some organizational studies have been conducted using experience-sampling
methods in which data are collected daily or throughout the day. These designs
can have the advantage of better operationalizing affective states, looking at immediate affect processes and better partitioning within subject and between subject
effects. However, the studies reported so far in the organizational literature using
experience-sampling methods are few in number and generally have not included
within-subject outcome or process data commensurate with the level of affect measurement. We think these should and will come, with affect gauged at the moment
as well as at other theoretically appropriate levels.

Appreciating Organizational Context
We also see research needs not as directly tied to developments in understanding
moods and emotions in other areas of psychology. These needs, in large part, stem
from organizational behavior’s focus on a particular context, the workplace. First, it
is apparent that we know less than we should about features of work environments
that are likely to produce particular (positive and negative) moods and emotions
among those who spend perhaps the majority of their working hours in them, five or
more days a week. We do have narrowly focused theories that tell us, for instance,
that if workers are treated unfairly by their employers, they somehow feel bad.
What we do not have and need are theories that guide us in identifying specific
kinds of work conditions and/or events (physical, social, or economic) associated
with specific affective states. For example, it would be helpful to know the kinds of
“organizational climates” (e.g., James & Jones 1974) that can be associated with
experiencing fear at work. This need for theory likely should be met, in part, by

methodological approaches more qualitatively rich (e.g., Fineman 1993) than the
ones we have reviewed here, for it seems that the theories required must be built
from the ground up rather than imported from other areas of psychology.
Second, research stemming from these meta-theories should recognize that a
worker’s perceptions of his/her work environment are not necessarily equivalent
to more objective (e.g., independent) assessments of work events and conditions.
Indeed, workers’ perceptions of their work environments may be influenced by
their affective traits and/or states, and it is those states that supposedly constitute
the dependent variables of interest.
Third, returning to the more general literature on moods and emotions, but
not leaving behind the problem of worker self-reports, it is important to at least
note that workers’ reports of how they feel may not adequately tap the constructs
of experienced moods and emotions. That is, it appears that affect can be nonconsciously processed (e.g., LeDoux 1995, Murphy 2001); affect so processed,
although presumably not subject to self-reports, may influence how organizational
members think and act. If this may be the case, then organizational researchers
are faced with a sizable methodological challenge, incorporating physiological
indicators of affect into their research.
Fourth, given that affect at the work group level has been demonstrated to be a
meaningful construct, more effort, following the lead of Bartel & Saavedra (2000),
ought to be expended to understand the processes by which feelings do and do
not come to be shared in the workplace. Moreover, such research should not be
limited to work groups. Can, for example, organizations, like work groups, have
an affective tone? If so, under what conditions does it come about?

Closing Thoughts
After too many decades, the study of affect in organizational behavior is alive
and well. Indeed, Mowday & Sutton’s (1993) charge, in an Annual Review of
Psychology chapter, that organizational behavior’s preoccupation with cognitive
processes “can lead to theory and research that portrays organization members
as cognitive stick figures whose behavior is unaffected by emotions” (p. 197) no
longer appears applicable. Considerable change in the field has been initiated in
the past few years. Although in their infancy, some recently initiated research programs show considerable promise (for example, those concerned with the effects
of leaders on the affective experiences of their followers, with the antecedents and
consequences of group affective tone, and with assessing the many hypotheses
derived from affective events theory). Much more importantly, we are confident
that many, many important questions about the production and consequences of
moods and emotions in the workplace have yet to be posed. The opportunity (the
challenge) is in front of us. If we are duly enticed by it, then organizational behavior
will evolve to and beyond considering workers as people who think and feel; we
will more fully appreciate that the groups and organizations to which they belong
also exhibit these person-like characteristics.
