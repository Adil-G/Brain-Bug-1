Misleading Interaction and Curvilinear Terms
Yoav Ganzach
Tel Aviv University
This article examines the relationships between interaction (product) terms and
curvilinear (quadratic) terms in regression models in which the independent variables are correlated. The author uses 2 substantive examples to demonstrate the
following outcomes: (a) If the appropriate quadratic terms are not added to the
estimated model, then the observed interaction may indicate a synergistic (offsetting) relationship between the independent variables, whereas the true relationship
is, in fact, offsetting(synergistic). (b) If the appropriate productterms are not added
to the equation, then the estimatedmodel may indicate concave (convex) relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable, whereas the
true relationship is, in fact, convex (concave). (c) If the appropriate product and
quadratic terms are not examined simultaneously, then the observed interactive or
curvilinearrelationships may be nonsignificant when such relationships exist. The
implications of these resultsfor the examination of interaction and quadratic effects
in multiple regression analysis are discussed.

Hypotheses about interaction effects between continuous variables are frequently examined in psychological research using multiple regression analysis
(e.g., Aiken & West, 1991; Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan,
1990). However, despite the plethora of research concerning these hypotheses, the appropriate methods to
test them remain a subject of debate. One issue that
has received much attention in the recent literature is
the relationship between interaction and curvilinear
effects when there is a high multicollinearity between
independent variables (e.g., Busemeyer & Jones,
1983; Lubinski & Humphreys, 1990; Shepperd, 1991;
MacCallum & Marr, 1995). Using two substantive
examples, I investigate the outcome of omitting one
of these two nonlinear effects when the true model
includes both of them and multicollinearity is high,
and I discuss the implications of these examples for
the process of fitting nonlinear models to empirical
data.
An interaction between two independent variables
is said to occur when the impact of one independent
variable on the dependent variable depends on the

level of another independent variable. When there are
two independent variables, X and Z, and one dependent variable, Y, interaction is usually conceptualized
in terms of the effect of the product XZ on Y. Note
that an interaction, as defined above, need not necessarily be represented by the product of the independent variables. However, for the sake of simplicity, in
the current article I assume that the true interactive
relationship between two variables is indeed associated with their product.
The existence of a "true" interaction is usually
examined by introducing a product term into a linear
model and observing the value of 133 in the following
regression equation:

A significant value of 133 indicates the existence of an
interaction. A positive value of [33 indicates that the
true relationship between Y and XZ is positive (a
positive interaction), whereas a negative value of [33
indicates that the true relationship between Y and XZ
is negative (a negative interaction). When X and Z are
continuous and positively related to Y, a negative interaction suggests an underlying offsetting relationship between the two independent variables, whereas
a positive interaction suggests an underlying synergistic relationship between them. An offsetting relationship implies that the relationship between X and Y
becomes more positive as the value of Z decreases,

whereas a synergistic relationship implies that the relationship between X and Y becomes more positive as
the value of Z increases (obviously, this statement is
symmetric with regard to X and Z). Note that the
concepts of offsetting and synergistic relationships are
meaningful only when the relationship between the
dependent variable and each of the independent variables is conditionally monotone (does not involve a
cross-over interaction); that is, when an increase in
one independent variable results in an increase in the
dependent variable for every value of the other independent variable. This relationship characterizes
many psychological phenomena (Dawes & Corrigan,
1974). For example, no matter how students score on
other tests, their mathematical achievement is likely
to be higher the higher they score on a mathematical
reasoning test or on a spatial reasoning test. No matter
how high the education of the father, the educational
expectations of the child are likely to increase with the
education of the mother.
Curvilinearity is said to occur when the functional
relationship between the dependent and the independent variables is negatively accelerated (concave) or
positively accelerated (convex). Such relationships
are usually examined by adding quadratic terms to a
linear model and observing the value of their coefficients:

A significantly negative value of 133 indicates a
concave relationship between X and Y, whereas a
significantly positive value indicates a couvex relationship (similarly, a significantly negative value of
134 indicates a concave relationship between Z and Y,
whereas a significantly positive value indicates a convex relationship). Note that a curvilinear relationship
as defined above need not necessarily be quadratic.
However, for the sake of simplicity, in the current
article I assume that a true curvilinear relationship is
indeed quadratic.
Finally, note also that the above discussion does not
distinguish between observed measures and latent
variables. The distinction between the two is not necessary for examining the basic issues associated with
the effect of model mispecification. However, because these issues are important in applied research,
they are discussed in the Discussion section. In particular, I discuss the effect of the level of measurement and the reliability of the measurement on the
outcome of model mispecification.

Misleading Interaction Terms
Though the study of interactions among variables
using product terms is common enough in the social
sciences, a number of problems are associated with
this method of analysis. In particular, when there is
multicollinearity between the independent variables,
the observed interaction may be spurious; that is, the
coefficient of the product term in the regression may
be significant even when there is no true interaction.
The reason for this is that when the correlation between X and Z increases so does the correlation between XZ and X 2 , which results in an overlap between
the variance explained by XZ and the variance explained by X 2 . Busemeyer and Jones (1983) presented
an analytic discussion of such "spurious" interaction,
and Lubinski and Humphreys (1990) provided a relevant substantive example. 1
Even more troubling than spurious interactions are
misleading interaction terms. A misleading interaction term occurs when the observed interaction term
in Equation I is positive, while the true interaction is
negative, or when the observed interaction term is
negative, while the true interaction is positive (a negative suppression situation; see Darlington, 1968; Tzelgov & Henik, 1991). This may happen when, concur-

I In the example of Lubinski and Humphreys (1990), advanced mathematics measure (labelled C) was regressed on
mathematical reasoning (Iahelled M) and on spatial reasoning (labelled S) in three consecutive stages. In the first
stage, C was regressed on M and S: in the second stage, C
was regressed on M, S, and MS; and in the third stage, M
and S were forced into the regression. and M 2 , S2, and MS
were then entered simultaneously in a stepwise procedure.
The results of the first stage indicateda strongeffect for M
but no effectfor S. The resultsof the second stageindicated
a strongeffectfor M and MS but no effectfor S. The results
of the third stage indicated an effect for M and M 2 , and no
other effects. On the basis of these results, Lubinski and
Humphreys concluded that the effect of MS was spurious.
However, this example is problematic because the second
stage is itself "spurious": It could be concluded a priori
(even withoutestimating the models of the third stage) that
the effectof MS in the secondstage is spurious. The reason
for this is that such an effect could he associated only with
a crossover interaction, in which there arc levels of M for

which an increase in S leads to a decrease in C. That is,

given a conditionally monotone relationship between M, S,
and C, a nonsignificant main effect of S in the first stage
implies that the interaction cannot be significant. Thus, any
observed interaction must be spurious.
