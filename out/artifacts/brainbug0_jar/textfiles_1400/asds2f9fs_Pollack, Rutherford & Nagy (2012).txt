Televised Business
Pitches

This research addresses the question of what specific entrepreneurs’ behavior increases the
propensity for resource acquisition. Within the context of business “pitches,” we explore
subtleties in the process via a theoretically derived model linking entrepreneurs’ preparedness behavior, perceived cognitive legitimacy, and amount of funding received. We test this
model using data coded from two sources: 14 episodes of the television show “Shark Tank”
that aired in 2009, as well as 84 episodes of “Dragons Den” that aired from 2005 to 2010.
Within these episodes, we specifically examine the 113 individual business pitches that
received funding. Overall, results suggest the relationship between entrepreneurs’ preparedness behavior and the amount of funding received is mediated by cognitive legitimacy.
Specifically, entrepreneurs’ increased preparedness behavior was positively related to
increased cognitive legitimacy. Cognitive legitimacy, in turn, was positively related
to amount of funding received. We offer thoughts regarding implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Introduction
To sustain and grow their ventures, it is crucial for early stage entrepreneurs to engage
in behaviors related to acquiring financial support. Unfortunately, the efforts of these
entrepreneurs to acquire crucial resources often fail due to inherent liabilities of newness
and smallness (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Delmar & Shane, 2004). Consequently, the prospects for the success of new ventures are precarious (Timmons, 1999).
Over 40 billion dollars is awarded each year to entrepreneurs in the United States
by equity financiers, including angel investors and venture capitalists (Angel Capital
Association, 2012; National Venture Capital Association, 2012). These investments

growth. Accordingly, from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, research regarding
entrepreneurs’ behavior that can facilitate the attainment of resources from financiers is
among the most pressing issues for entrepreneurs and scholars (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Baron, 2007; Delmar & Shane, 2004; Maxwell, Jeffrey, & Lévesque, 2011). Though it is
widely accepted that “Asking for funds is a behavior . . .” (Bird & Schjoedt, 2009, p. 335),
as researchers we know little about what specific entrepreneurs’ behavior increases the
propensity for this type of resource acquisition.
One emerging area of study on resource attainment behavior that resides at the
confluence of research and practice relates to the “business pitch.” The business pitch
represents efforts on the part of an entrepreneur (i.e., the pitcher) to entice an investor
(i.e., catcher) to provide resources (e.g., capital). In the present research, consistent with
calls for behaviorally anchored inquiry, we examine subtleties of entrepreneurs’
communication-focused behavior of pitching (e.g., Bird, 1989; Bird & Schjoedt, 2009).
As Bird and Schjoedt (p. 342) noted, “Communication is critical to overcoming the
liabilities of newness since actions taken to legitimize, create positive perception or
reputation, and establish reliable production, delivery, and accountability systems all
involve communication or display.” In sum, entrepreneurs who seek resources from
investors via pitching engage in a form of communication that constitutes behavior.1 And,
this behavior (of pitching) is critical as objective organizational performance measures
that can demonstrate to potential investors that a venture is a viable investment option are
generally not available. The lack of information related to operating revenues and
expenses can severely deter the investment process, as the basic axiom of investment
theory remains that an investor will invest only when the present value of the future returns
from the new venture is calculated and known to be greater than the proposed present
value of the investment (Brealey & Myers, 1991). Therefore, the pitch is a critical portion
of the entrepreneur’s signaling and enticement strategy. In some cases, it is the entrepreneur’s only signaling strategy (Aldrich, 1999; Elsbach, 2003).
Two primary theoretical contributions arise from the present work. First, we propose
and test a model through which entrepreneurs’ behavior affects funding decisions by
investors. In doing so, we move beyond extant conceptualizations of the relation between
preparedness and funding. We draw on the narrative sensemaking literature and delve
deeply into the construct of cognitive legitimacy to provide theoretical clarification—we
show, theoretically and empirically, that cognitive legitimacy is the mediating mechanism
through which preparedness behaviors influence funding decisions. This extension to the
literature provides a theory-based model by which researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors can more clearly understand how funding decisions are made and by what processes
decisions can potentially be influenced. Second, we offer a theoretically driven (and
empirically validated) conceptualization of how cognitive legitimacy can be assessed.
This measurement clarification can help to move the field forward by eliminating unnecessary variance that may distort findings and/or lead to contradictory findings when
examining preparedness and investors’ funding decisions.
We elaborate on the above extensions of the literature in the following sections. First,
we examine the extant research on the pitch and the subtle behaviors enacted in the
pitching process. Using narrative sensemaking as a theoretical base, we specifically
review the literature on the behavioral nature of preparedness as a communication
process. Then, we review how this communication behavior leads to perceived cognitive

legitimacy between entrepreneurial actions, signals, and behaviors related to the pitching
process and new venture funding. We then present the context and results of our study,
followed by a discussion of the implications and limitations. We conclude by offering
directions for future research efforts.

Theoretical Background
The Pitch
Why study the business pitch? Central to the broad activity of opportunity exploitation is interaction with stakeholders (Baron & Markman, 2000, 2003), and the
communication-focused behavior of pitching to potential equity stakeholders, such as
angel investors and venture capitalists, is one of the most important behaviors that an
entrepreneur will enact in the exploitation process (Mason & Harrison, 2001). Though it
is true that a good pitch likely cannot overcome a poorly identified opportunity, it also true
that simply identifying a superior opportunity will also not guarantee financing—efficient
and effective exploitation is crucial. Stated differently, without a good pitch, resources
will not likely be forthcoming.
Adding to the crucial nature of the new venture pitch is the simple fact that procuring
equity financing is often more difficult for new firms (e.g., Berger & Udell, 2002;
Ulvenblad, 2008). The startup context is distinct because adolescent and mature organizations have verifiable financial records, whereas nascent and newly started firms do not.
Decisions made by equity investors regarding older firms can arguably be made in a fairly
objective fashion—but, these objective decisions are largely based on historical performance. Lack of information, therefore, in this new venture context, requires potential
financiers to infer certain unobservable characteristics of entrepreneurs and their new
ventures from known and demonstrated features. As a result, investor decisions regarding
new firms necessarily involve a substantial subjective component. Due to this inherent
cognitive requirement, understanding the fundamentals of successfully pitching new
ventures has become an important component of entrepreneurship research.
Finance theory provides some insight into this situation via the related concepts of
adverse selection, information opacity, and moral hazard. Adverse selection describes a
condition whereby the new firm will likely face a lack of legitimacy. In a market where
buyers and investors cannot accurately gauge the quality of the product they are considering, the marketplace will likely offer poor quality products (Akerlof, 1970). Since most
financiers are very aware of this, a high-quality firm with little history and proof of
desirability is unlikely to be selected by financiers. While adverse selection addresses the
presumed quality of a given startup, moral hazard describes a different financier-related
concern. Moral hazard is an agency problem that speaks to the possibility that an entrepreneur in a given firm could engage in behavior that is not in the best interests of the
financier, and that financier would have a difficult time discerning it (Chaganti, De
Carolis, & Deeds, 1995). This is the case because most new firms and their offerings are
opaque—meaning that they do not necessarily engage in full disclosure and may misrepresent facts (Rutherford, Buller, & Stebbins, 2009). This condition, resulting in lack of
clarity and understanding on the part of the potential financier, facilitates and compounds
the adverse selection problem most new venture leaders face.
Accordingly, to overcome this compounded problem, entrepreneurs must direct substantial amounts of energy and attention to the pitching of their ideas. Via the process
of narrative sensemaking (e.g., O’Connor, 2002), entrepreneurs craft understandable,

<-----Page 3----->believable, and intriguing narratives about the opportunities their firms offer in order to
overcome the uncertainty, information opacity, and risk associated with the investment
decision-making process (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Uzzi, 1996). Relaying narratives is
considered to be an effective legitimization tactic because narratives are rich, subjective,
and not subject to external validation (Anderson, 2005; Delmar & Shane, 2004; O’Connor).
These components make the narrative the ideal tool for startup or nascent entrepreneur.
In many ways, the narrative is the most important tool that entrepreneurs have to
attract business partners. These behaviors are thought to determine significantly whether
organizations are granted identities and rights to existence (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
Therefore, the quality of the pitch goes a long way in determining funding decisions by
financiers such as angel investors and venture capitalists, and the eventual success of the
venture (Chen, Yao, & Kotha, 2009).

Narrative Sensemaking in a Pitch Context
A business is talked into existence (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Extant
literature highlights how communication, defined as “information exchange” (Bird &
Schjoedt, 2009, p. 342) can enable entrepreneurs to achieve their goals. Entrepreneurs,
through communicating, provide order and familiarity to previously unordered things in a
way that illuminates a value proposition, and encourages stakeholders to bestow resources
upon their firm. The business does not precede the narrative, but vice versa. Throughout
history, the use of symbolism and narratives as mechanisms for norm setting and culture
creation is widely documented, particularly in the organizational creation stage (Golant &
Sillince, 2007; Holt & Macpherson, 2010; Wry, Lounsbury, & Glynn, 2011; Zott & Huy,
2007). In the past research, the process of entrepreneurs seeking support from key
stakeholders has been termed “cultural entrepreneurship” in that entrepreneurs use narratives to share an identity of their business, illustrate legitimacy, and acquire resources
(Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
From a theoretical perspective, this process of entrepreneurs communicating information about their ventures, specifically via a business pitch, is rooted in the literature of
narrative sensemaking (see O’Connor, 2002; Weick, 1979). Within this context, narrative
sensemaking is defined as “. . . an entrepreneur’s ability to locate and adjust a taken
position relative to distinct but interconnected plot-lines in which the communicator and
relevant organization figure as primary, secondary, and minor characters” (O’Connor,
p. 37). Put simply, via the process of narrative sensemaking, entrepreneurs create and then
relate a story in which the focal characters are linked in action and goal. This story, then,
frames the context of the entrepreneur–investor dyadic interaction. In this way, narrative
sensemaking is more than storytelling. Whereas storytelling (i.e., the narrative) addresses
the “what” of the pitch, sensemaking describes the “how.” It is more process oriented,
consensual, and subtle than simple storytelling.
In the pitch context, sensemaking describes a process whereby individuals (financiers)
are attempting to apply order, and familiarity, to “an ongoing unknowable, unpredictable
streaming experience” (Weick et al., 2005, p. 410). Ostensibly, the entrepreneur has
already made sense of the venture’s value proposition, and is attempting to guide financiers (i.e., sense giving) so that they may also make sense of the venture through use of a
narrative. To fully engage and enlighten, though, a pitcher must extend sensemaking to
include enactment. Enactment, or joint social construction (Downing, 2005), describes a
process whereby the entrepreneur enlists the help of the stakeholders to create a future for
the organization (Mason & Harrison, 2001), by acting as if the venture already existed
(Gartner, Bird, & Starr, 1992).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Effectively enlisting the support of relevant stakeholders is done via communication
processes that are theatrical in nature (e.g., Anderson, 2005; Downing, 2005). Indeed, this
process may best be understood in terms of a play, or performance, particularly in light of
the unique sample used in this research. In this “play,” the entrepreneur is the actor. The
financiers represent the audience. The situation is the stage. Most often, the script is
partially prepared (i.e., the business pitch) and partially improvised through financier
participation. During the pitch, the entrepreneur must guide the audience in making sense
of the venture. The televised context studied here (i.e., “Shark Tank,” “Dragons Den”)
offers a unique situation where one is able to view the entire process.2
The entrepreneur’s ability to enact this “play” effectively is likely an indicator of
eventual venture success; and, there is a good reason for this. Enactment is creation, and
creation is the genesis of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1988). Financiers often perceive
entrepreneurs who cannot enact their plans effectively as unable to create viable ventures
(Anderson, 2005; Mason & Harrison, 2001). These key stakeholders understand new
ventures are boundary spanning activities that do not arise in a vacuum. New ventures are
started and grown only through exchange between stakeholders—financiers, key customers, and the entrepreneurs representing the new ventures. So, though the pitch may seem
an arbitrary and overly subjective method for evaluating future ventures, it may be the best
proxy and predictor of success available.
In sum, a pitch is a narrative. And, the best narratives draw in the audience to create
a familiar reality that otherwise does not exist. To the degree that a narrative can do this,
it will be rewarded, just as the best novelists and screenwriters are generously rewarded
(Anderson & Warren, 2011). Via the process of narrative sensemaking, entrepreneurs can
craft and tell a story that, if properly enacted, can engage financiers in such a way that
serves to (1) justify the existence of a company, (2) convince others to devote funds and
other crucial resources to the company, and (3) build the tangible and intangible worth of
the company (O’Connor, 2002, p. 36).
The effectiveness of the pitch, however, can only be fully realized by entrepreneurs
who are prepared. And, what specific characteristic a pitch (and pitcher) must exhibit to
entice investors sufficiently to provide resources is an area that remains relatively unexplored. It is our theory-based submission that, before entrepreneurs can attain financial
resources, these financiers must bestow legitimacy upon them. Thus, whatever the particulars to pitching entail, they must result in the granting of legitimacy. Accordingly, we
believe that preparedness behaviors are critically important in the pitching process. We
build on, and extend, the current literature by proposing a model in which the relationship
between preparedness behaviors and the outcome of funding decisions is mediated by
cognitive legitimacy (see Figure 1).

Preparedness in the Business Pitch
Preparedness has been described as one of two dimensions of the higher order
construct “entrepreneurial passion.” Yet, whereas the other dimension of entrepreneurial
passion, “affective passion,” relates to an entrepreneur’s intense emotional state of being,
preparedness is reflective of the behaviors that demonstrate understanding and thoroughness on the part of the entrepreneur (Cardon, Sudek, & Mitteness, 2009; Chen et al.,
2009). In contrast to affective passion, perceived as the demonstration of emotion, enthusiasm, and energy, the manifestation of preparedness is often a well-delivered script, with

<-----Page 5----->appropriate and interesting content. Furthermore, preparedness represents a demonstration of the “immense complexity of accumulated learning that individuals bring to the new
venture creation process” (Cope, 2005, p. 378). That is, preparedness can be thought of as
a state of being—a condition of readiness. Given that many questions are likely to be
posed during the business pitch process, astute and informed answers will also signal to
an investor that the entrepreneur invested a significant amount of time, energy, and money
in the new venture and is ready to succeed if vested.
The recent identification and measurement of the “preparedness” construct offers
what we feel is a potentially powerful behavioral component of an effective business
pitch. Importantly, in Chen et al. (2009), preparedness was identified as a cognitively
based construct. Building on this work, as well as the contentions of Vallerand et al.
(2003) that recognize the importance of the affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions of passion, we contend that perceptions of preparedness result primarily from
observable entrepreneurial behavior.3 This contention is similar to the idea that the entrepreneurial behavior of writing a business plan may foretell a well-organized business.
That is, consistent with a learning process view of entrepreneurship (e.g., Cope, 2005), the
process of writing the business plan may foster insights and knowledge beneficial to the
process of entrepreneurship (Bird & Schjoedt, 2009). Accordingly, though extant research
has examined the direct relation between preparedness and venture funding, we seek to
examine this construct more closely by investigating the theoretically based mediating
mechanism of cognitive legitimacy. In this section, we review the literature related to
preparedness, and in the following section, we examine the construct of legitimacy.
Chen et al. (2009), across two studies, developed an instrument to assess the relative
level of passion of a given entrepreneur. In developing this instrument, they encountered
two factors—affective (i.e., passion) and cognitive (i.e., preparedness). For study 1, they
developed the scale to establish the face, convergent, and predictive validity of the
proposed scale and then experimentally manipulated passion (i.e., high, low) and business
plan quality (i.e., high quality, medium quality). Overall, the validation work for the scale,
using undergraduate, MBA, and doctoral students as participants, produced an adequate
way to assess entrepreneurial passion and preparedness. This work enabled the assessment
of a laboratory experiment, using MBA and Executive MBA students as participants,
where results indicated that preparedness had a significant effect on funding decisions,
while the effect of affective passion was not significant. Furthermore, this experiment
showed that the verbal content of the video presentation participants viewed and the
executive summary of the business plan positively predicted investors’ perceptions of the
presenter’s preparedness. This, in turn, positively predicted funding decisions.
In study 2, a sample of 55 investors evaluated 31 business plans and subsequent
presentations. Using the scale developed in study 1, these investors then responded to
items meant to measure an entrepreneur’s affective passion and preparedness. These
scores were then used to predict the investors’ decision of whether or not to invest.
Preparedness displayed by entrepreneurs emerged as a significant predictor of investment
decisions, explaining roughly 24% of the variance. Interestingly, affective passion was not
found to be a significant predictor. While affective passion has been assumed to positively
impact desired outcomes, in those data, that seems not to be the case. These data, from
studies 1 and 2, not only highlight the importance of preparedness, relative to affective
passion, but they also illustrate similar results using various samples (i.e., students as well
as investors).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Related to Chen et al. (2009), Cardon et al. (2009) conducted a study which
assessed angel investors’ reactions to displayed affective passion in business pitches. In
their study, they looked at affective passion, preparedness, and commitment displayed in
the pitching process and then assessed whether or not the angels invested in that particular business. Pitches by 60 entrepreneurs were videotaped, viewed, and then coded
by the researchers on the various passion dimensions (i.e., affective passion, preparedness, and commitment). They were then able to observe objectively the decisions made
by 53 angels. Their results were similar to Chen et al. in that only preparedness
predicted funding.
The empirical research is new and developing, however, and implications should be
drawn carefully, as conflicting relations may arise (e.g., Sudek, Mitteness, & Cardon,
2010); overall, though, the initial results are suggestive of a positive relation between
enacting preparedness behavior and positive outcomes. Accordingly, we present our first
hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1: In a new venture pitch, entrepreneurs’ preparedness behaviors will
have a positive effect on amount of funding received from potential investors.
However, as noted above, it is our theory-based submission that the nature of the
relation between preparedness and positive outcomes is behavioral—specifically, we
contend that the relation between enacted preparedness behavior and resource granting
will work through the mediating mechanism of cognitive legitimacy. Accordingly, we
review and discuss cognitive legitimacy in the following section.

Cognitive Legitimacy and the Business Pitch
Broadly defined, legitimacy is “. . . a social judgment of acceptance, appropriateness,
and desirability, [that] enables organizations to access other resources needed to survive
and grow” (Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002, p. 41). While that definition clearly takes the new
firm into account, much of the work on the topic has been done in the institutional theory
realm and has therefore taken place in the established and aged firm context (e.g.,
Deephouse, 1996; Suchman, 1995). Legitimacy is often discussed as an outcome of
cultural support that can protect an existing firm from the external environment (Meyer &
Rowan, 1977). As a result, in much of this extant literature legitimacy is viewed as a way
to overcome crises and negative press that may impact the organization (Child, 1972;
Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978).
Legitimacy in the context of the new firm has a different connotation than it does
in the context of the established organization. This variation may be a result of the
heightened level of importance legitimacy has attained with regard to obtaining initial
key resources. Unlike older and larger firms, most new firms possess very little legitimacy. For an established organization, increasing incremental levels of legitimacy is far
less difficult than attaining the initial base at the beginning of an organization’s life
cycle (Rutherford & Buller, 2007). As noted, this leads to an important contention
seldom expressed in the literature: for many new ventures, legitimacy, not resource
attainment, is the key outcome (Delmar & Shane, 2004). This is the case because, at
this stage, the latent notion of legitimacy is a precursor to tangible (e.g., financing) and
intangible (e.g., reputation) resources. As a result, an entrepreneur’s pitch should
focus on establishing a legitimacy base. In the present research, we propose that entrepreneurs’ preparedness behavior can facilitate perceptions of legitimacy, specifically
cognitive legitimacy.
June, 2012

<-----Page 7----->Several typologies of legitimacy have been put forth in the literature (e.g., Hunt &
Aldrich, 1996; Suchman, 1995), and the preponderance of this literature suggests three
types of legitimacy exist: regulative, normative, and cognitive. Regulative describes legitimacy attained from maintaining proper behavior according to laws and rules set forth by
governments and industries. Normative legitimacy is attained by complying with “softer”
requirements set forth by key stakeholders in society (e.g., performance measures, organizational structure considerations, adequate strategic planning). Finally, cognitive legitimacy describes an even more tacit form of legitimacy, in which stakeholders make
legitimacy judgments about an organization passively and not based on active evaluation.
“From the cognitive perspective of legitimacy, organizations are legitimate when they are
understandable (i.e., there is greater awareness and therefore less uncertainty involved
with the organization) rather than considering when they are desirable” (Shepherd &
Zacharakis, 2003, p. 151).
A key tenet of legitimacy is that it is, by definition, a stakeholder driven process. Thus,
a new venture cannot take legitimacy. The new venture must instead be granted legitimacy
by influential stakeholders (e.g., financiers, employees, suppliers, consumers). These
stakeholders, either analytically or tacitly, decide that a firm has the necessary characteristics to interest them. For most stakeholders, this means having a feeling of relative
permanence from an organization—a feeling that it is not teetering on the edge of
extinction (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). Again, for these entrepreneurs, the pitch is the primary
tool at their disposal to influence this sentiment.
Building on this research, and considering the context of our study, we direct our
attention to one form of legitimacy. We focus on cognitive legitimacy because it has been
found to be especially important for new ventures (Choi & Shepherd, 2005). Suchman
(1995, p. 583) described this type of legitimacy as “the most subtle and powerful” of the
dimensions of legitimacy. Notably, when a venture achieves a heightened level of cognitive legitimacy, that venture is said to be taken for granted. When a stakeholder does not
need to actively think about (i.e., takes for granted) a venture’s legitimacy, that venture is
legitimate. Since new firms’ lack of history generally raises red flags, being taken for
granted is elusive for them.
How, specifically, can a pitch serve to generate legitimacy via narrative sensemaking?
Business pitches serve to establish, and then resolve, a paradox. On one hand, the venture
must be unique in product or service offering. The entrepreneur must communicate to
financiers why the new venture adds value. In discussing this added value, risk is reduced
because the venture’s offerings are perceived as unique and therefore likely to generate
competitive advantage. On the other hand, it must demonstrate that it will deliver this
distinctive product or service in a reliable and credible way. In other words, the manner in
which these unique offerings add value must be appropriate (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
Communicating distinctiveness accomplishes the goal of establishing the existence of a
sustainable competitive advantage, or, at a minimum, a core competency (Whetten, 2000;
Whetten & Godfrey, 1998). Establishing this distinctiveness is particularly important
when pitching to equity financiers. Establishing appropriateness demonstrates that the
new venture fits nicely within established societal and industry values, beliefs, and norms
(Suchman, 1995). Other than the pitch, the new venture entrepreneur has few tools with
which to signal this congruence. And, it is from establishing congruence with these
established values, beliefs, and norms that legitimacy flows. Accordingly, we present our
second hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2: In a new venture pitch, perceptions of cognitive legitimacy will have
a positive effect on amount of funding received from potential investors.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->The Mediating Mechanism of Cognitive Legitimacy
Effective entrepreneurs, in the business pitch, will focus directly upon enhancing the
legitimacy of their firms in the minds of investors (Delmar & Shane, 2004). Entrepreneurs
may see myriad organizational attributes as clear and distinguishable signals of legitimacy. However, these entrepreneurs will not be granted legitimacy by stakeholders unless
stakeholders perceive their new venture assets and ideas as legitimate (e.g., Aldrich &
Martinez, 2001; Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002). Positively impacting the stakeholders’
appraisal of the firm can be effectively accomplished via the pitch, because pitches aim to
“cue plausibility and build confidence that the enterprise can succeed” (Lounsbury &
Glynn, 2001, p. 551).
By displaying preparedness behaviors in the pitch, entrepreneurs can positively affect
the chances of attaining cognitive legitimacy. As mentioned, institutional theorists hold
that cognitive legitimacy will be bestowed upon entrepreneurs only when stakeholders
take the entrepreneur and the new venture for granted (Hannan & Freeman, 1989).
Preparedness behaviors serve to allay the concerns, and remove “red flags” that erode
taken-for-grantedness. By displaying these behaviors, entrepreneurs are utilizing the
narrative to help financiers make sense of the venture quickly and easily. The more time
and effort it takes for financiers to make sense of the business, the less likely that the
entrepreneur will be deemed legitimate. It is our contention that by perceiving these
preparedness behaviors in the narrative, financiers will more quickly and easily make
sense of the venture.
The literature on the topic supports this contention. For example, nascent ventures
whose founders engaged in activities meant to positively affect stakeholder perceptions
increase formation and survival chances (Delmar & Shane, 2004; Tornikoski & Newbert,
2007). Drawing on the theoretical background of the present research, we assert that
preparedness behaviors are one behavioral set that can influence the perception of new
ventures’ cognitive legitimacy. Accordingly, building on the extant literature, we offer our
final two hypotheses and propose that cognitive legitimacy mediates the relation between
preparedness and the outcome of amount of funding. Specifically, we propose that preparedness will lead to increased levels of cognitive legitimacy; in turn, this perceived
legitimacy will lead to a greater likelihood of receiving greater quantities of funding from
equity investors.
Hypothesis 3: In a new venture pitch, entrepreneurs’ preparedness behaviors will
have a positive effect on perceptions of cognitive legitimacy.
Hypothesis 4: Cognitive legitimacy will mediate the relation between preparedness
and the outcome of amount of funding.

Method
Development of a Cognitive Legitimacy Measure
We developed and tested a measure for the cognitive legitimacy construct. We first
generated five items that we felt reflect the cognitive legitimacy construct by reviewing the
theory-based works of legitimacy researchers. For this development we focused on those
legitimacy researchers who specifically address the new firm (e.g., Aldrich & Martinez,
2001; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2003; Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002). The five items first
generated included: “I envision this business receiving high-profile endorsements in the
future”; “I envision this business receiving favorable press coverage in the future”;

<-----Page 9----->“Because of the founder’s experience, this business has a founder who benefits the
organization”; “I envision this business having a top management team who will benefit
the organization”; and “I envision this business having the resources to be successful in its
industry.”
Exploratory Factor Analysis #1. After the item generation, we constructed a questionnaire to test the construct validity of these five items. Participants responded using a 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert scale format. Respondents who volunteered were instructed to watch a 3-minute video recording of a grocery store grand
opening in the Northeastern region of the United States (Glickburg, 2010). The respondents were subsequently asked to provide their opinions about the business by answering
the short survey we constructed. A total of 116 junior or senior-standing students enrolled
in one of five managerial courses offered during the 2010 summer term at a medium-sized
private university in the Midwestern region of the United States completed the survey.
Approximately 61% of the respondents were male.
Using the data collected, the 5 items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) utilizing principal axis factoring and oblimin rotation, with the scree test criterion
used to confirm the items relate to just one factor. A two-factor model was declared and
estimated in SPSS Modeler Professional, Version 13.0. Given the sample data, all 5 items
estimated loaded well, with no issues related to low factor loadings (<.50), high cross
loadings (>.40), or low communalities (<.30) existing. The estimated factor solution
accounted for approximately 57% of the total variance in the data and exhibited a KMO
measure of sampling adequacy of .75. All communalities ranged from .32 to .55. Table 1
illustrates the items’ factor loadings, with significant loadings in italics. Table 2 is the
complete list of the items resulting from this EFA.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Shortly after examining the simplified scale through the
use of the EFA technique, we collected additional data to further test the construct validity
of the model. We instructed a sample of respondents to watch the same video recording of

a grocery store grand opening in the Northeastern region of the United States that was
used in the previous round of data collection. Participants responded using a 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert scale format. One hundred six undergraduate
business students enrolled in five separate 2010 summer-term business courses at a private
university in the Midwestern region of the United States completed the survey. No
students completed the survey twice. Of these college-aged students, approximately 70%
of the respondents were male.
After data collection, a 5-item confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model that declared
the use of one latent variable related to cognitive legitimacy was estimated using LISREL
8.80 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2001). Inspection of the model results indicated the model was
not optimal (c2 = 40.56, df = 5, r = .000, GFI = .87; AGFI = .60; CFI = .86; NNFI = .72;
standardized RMR = .09; RMSEA = .26). Squared multiple correlations (SMCs) ranged
from .37 to .80. Two items related to cognitive legitimacy did not sufficiently explain a
significant amount of variance in the underlying latent variables they represented. Therefore, given the data, we were unable to confirm these 5 items reliably and parsimoniously
measure the cognitive legitimacy construct. Accordingly, we proceeded to examine these
data using an additional EFA.
Exploratory Factor Analysis #2. The two underperforming items were deleted, and an
additional EFA was conducted using the data from the second sample (i.e., 106 respondents). We had to rely on EFA because of the inability to compute a 3-item CFA model in
LISREL 8.80 due to model saturation and the lack of degrees of freedom. We computed
an EFA utilizing principal axis factoring and oblimin rotation, with the scree test criterion
used to confirm the items relate to just one factor. A 2-factor model was again declared and
estimated in SPSS Modeler Professional, Version 13.0. Given this sample data, all 3 items
estimated were deemed to have loaded very well, with no issues related to low factor
loadings (<.50), high cross loadings (>.40), or low communalities (<.30) existing. The
estimated factor solution accounted for approximately 72.7% of the total variance in the
data and exhibited a KMO measure of sampling adequacy of .70. All communalities
ranged from .35 to .51. Table 3 illustrates the items factor loadings, with significant
loadings in italics. Table 4 is the complete list of the items resulting from this EFA and
used in the empirical analysis related to hypothesis testing.

Sample and External Validity
Data from the research in our main study, described below, are based on coding from
two sources. First, we collected data from the 64 business pitches presented by the
entrepreneurs featured in the 14 episodes of season 1 of the television show “Shark Tank,”
which aired in 2009. “Shark Tank” features a panel of five investors who view the pitches
of entrepreneurs seeking capital. After viewing the business pitch, the investors (i.e., the
Sharks) decide to invest, or not, in the entrepreneurs’ businesses. Our second data source,
similarly, came from the 248 pitches presented by the entrepreneurs in the 84 episodes of
seasons 1 through 8 of the British television show “Dragons Den.” “Dragons Den” is
structured and formatted similarly to “Shark Tank,” except that in this case the investors
are referred to as “Dragons” rather than “Sharks.”
The use of coding from media sources is a well-established methodological technique.
For instance, research in other domains, such as the medical field, has long employed
coding techniques such as this (Diem, Lantos, & Tulsky, 1996), and used television
episodes to teach medical techniques (Østbye, Miller, & Keller, 1997). These studies, for
12

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->example, relied on data coded from episodes of the television show “ER,” in which actors
portray medical personnel and patients at a fictional Chicago hospital.
This method is just now gaining traction within the domain of entrepreneurship. One
main concern related to the data collection method is external validity (i.e., the accuracy
of the portrayal). One recent study (Maxwell et al., 2011) examined the decision making
of investors on the television show “Dragons Den.” Maxwell et al. acknowledged concerns related to validity and addressed these succinctly by noting that studies from
multiple television shows (e.g., “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” “Weakest Link,” “Deal
or No Deal”) have “confirmed the general applicability of television shows to ‘real world’
decision making” (for a review, see Maxwell et al., pp. 218–219).
Our confidence in our approach was bolstered knowing Maxwell et al. (2011) had
already coded data from “Dragons Den.” To further increase our confidence, we contacted
the producers of the show “Shark Tank” and entrepreneurs featured on the show, to
confirm the accuracy of the television content. Through written correspondence with
Barbara Corcoran, one of the show’s featured investors, we verified that the show is not
scripted in any way, and the potential investors are in no way primed or ask to make
investment choices for the purpose of making the television show more exciting and
suspenseful. Accordingly, based on extant theory, prior research, and our own investigations, we have confidence that the interactions displayed on the shows “Shark Tank” and
“Dragons Den” provide the present context, and results, with an appropriate level of
external validity.

Coding Procedure
Building on recent work using data collection through coding of television show
episodes (i.e., Maxwell et al., 2011) and other videotaped presentations (e.g., Baron &
Brush, 1999; Hoehn-Weiss, Brush, & Baron, 2004), we developed specific coding
procedures. Coder training took place over the course of three academic semesters in
which 13 junior level, or senior level, undergraduate students first enrolled in an introductory entrepreneurship class (Fall 2009, Spring 2010), then continued this research as
a part of an independent study project for academic credit (Fall 2010). During the spring
of 2010 and the fall of 2010, these 13 students were responsible for conducting in-depth
reviews of the literature to determine what constructs, both theoretical and practical,
would predict successful business pitches (i.e., positive funding decisions by investors).
From this substantial literature base, these students worked closely with the faculty
supervisor to develop and test a coding scheme based on the measures described below
(i.e., preparedness, cognitive legitimacy).
To refine the coding scheme, we tested the process by examining the coding sheet
while each independently viewing an episode of “Shark Tank” and “Dragons Den.” We
then discussed the execution of the coding scheme to resolve any disparities in results.
Five coders then proceeded to code all the business pitches in “Shark Tank,” and the
remaining coders rated the eight seasons of “Dragons Den.” We merged the ratings
provided by coders, and consistent with best practices in the literature and to establish
scores for the correctness and reliability of the coding, calculated values for inter-rater
reliability (ICC) for each variable we utilized in the study’s empirical analysis. Since all
the averaged ICC consistency calculations resulted in values .70 or above, we deemed the
ratings to be representative of what any particular sample of raters would have provided
as ratings and proceeded with our analysis (Bliese, 2000; James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984).
Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for relevant variables are shown in
Tables 5–7 and illustrate the results of the ICC calculations.

Measures
Preparedness. We assessed preparedness using the 5-item scale developed by Chen et al.
(2009): “The presentation content had substance,” “The presentation was thoughtful, and
in-depth,” “The presentation was coherent, and logical,” “The presenter(s) articulated the
relationship between the business plan and the broader context,” and “The presenter(s)
cited facts to support his/her arguments.” The trained coders responded to these items on
a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). These items
achieved an adequate reliability (a = .96).
Cognitive Legitimacy. We analyzed perceptions of cognitive legitimacy using our newly
developed measure. The items used in the analysis included: “I envision this business

receiving high-profile endorsements in the future,” “I envision this business receiving
favorable press coverage in the future,” and “I envision this business having a top
management team that will benefit the organization.” Coders responded to these items on
a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). These items
achieved an adequate reliability (a = .86).
Amount of Funding. Trained coders assessed amount of funding using the actual television episodes as well as archival data posted on the shows’ websites. Values from the
British show “Dragons Den” were converted from the monetary value of euro or pound to
U.S. dollars (M = $188,486, SD = $113,574) at the conversion rate of the month in which
each episode aired. Prior to the analyses below, the natural log transformation of funding
was completed. In our analysis, we included only the 113 pitches that received funding.
We made this inclusion criterion for two reasons. First, we wanted to escape from the
straightjacket of using a binary outcome (i.e., funded vs. not funded). Binary outcomes
limit the generalizations we can draw from the data—simply, empirically, illustrating that
entrepreneurs with more (less) preparedness do (do not) get funded is a modest contribution. Rather, we focused on amount of funding. Specifically, we chose this more
fine-grained outcome as it can be more informative empirically. We aimed to show that
entrepreneurs with greater preparedness behavior would foster greater cognitive
legitimacy—and, in turn, we wanted to show that this positively predicts amount of
funding received.
June, 2012

15

<-----Page 15----->Second, on a related note, we also only wanted to include funded pitches to avoid
coders responding to the demand characteristics of the viewing process. Demand characteristics represent a cue that can make participants respond in a certain way, and thus,
change the outcome of the research (e.g., a research assistant in a laboratory experiment
expresses a preference and biases the results). A great deal of research focuses on the
implications of demand characteristics (see, Laney et al., 2008; Navarick, 2007; Rosenthal
& Rosnow, 2009). Demand characteristics are often concerns within experimental designs
but have relevance in our case. Specifically, in pitches that were of poor quality (e.g., poor
preparedness), the investors’ (i.e., Sharks’, Dragons’) body language, and verbal comments could unduly influence the coders’ ratings. Therefore, this bias is a methodological
concern as the coded responses could be influenced. However, when we examine only
pitches that were funded, the positive responses to pitches effectively holds (relatively)
constant feedback from the investors—by using only pitches which were received favorably (i.e., funded), we alleviated this methodological concern.
Control Variables. We included “entrepreneurial experience” as well as the “responsiveness of the entrepreneur to feedback” as additional predictor variables in our model to
assess the vulnerability of the findings to spuriousness and to rule out two plausible
alternate explanations (Becker, 2005). On a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
scale, entrepreneurial experience was rated by coders in response to the following prompt:
“The entrepreneur had experience in the industry in which the business operates.” Again,
on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale, responsiveness to feedback was
rated by coders in response to the following prompt: “The entrepreneur was responsive
to the feedback of the investors.” We included both entrepreneurial experience and
responsiveness to feedback based on the premise that more experienced entrepreneurs,
and entrepreneurs more responsive to feedback, may have a higher propensity to receive
funding in the business pitch setting.

Results
Figure 1 depicts our empirical model and results.4 To examine our proposed mediated model, consistent with best practices in the literature (e.g., De Carolis, Litzky, &
Eddleston, 2009; Preacher & Hayes, 2004), we closely followed recommendations for
testing for the presence of mediators (Hayes, 2009; Preacher & Hayes, 2008). Baron
and Kenny (1986) asserted that mediators must meet four criteria: (1) the predictor must
significantly affect the outcome when the mediator is not included; (2) the mediator
must significantly affect the outcome; (3) the predictor must significantly affect the
mediator; and (4) the significant effect of the predictor on the outcome must decrease
when the mediator is in the model. Full mediation is present if the variance accounted

4. Thanks to one anonymous reviewer for insights here. Due to the high potential for conceptual (i.e.,
theory-based) and empirical (i.e., correlation of .56) overlap of the preparedness and cognitive legitimacy
constructs we further explored this relation to establish the distinctiveness of preparedness relative to cognitive
legitimacy. We computed an EFA utilizing principal axis factoring and oblimin rotation, with the scree test
criterion used to confirm that the items loaded on two separate factors. Data supported a two factor solution
with the estimated factor solution accounting for 79.21% of the total variance (Preparedness, factor 1,
Eigenvalue = 5.44; Cognitive Legitimacy, factor 2, Eigenvalue = 1.35). Consistent with procedures described
earlier for examining the factor structure of the cognitive legitimacy construct, we found no issues related to
low factor loadings (<.50), high cross loadings (>.40), or low communalities (<.30).

for by the predictor is nonsignificant with the addition of the mediator; alternatively,
partial mediation is when the influence of the independent variable decreases but
remains significant.
In the first step of testing our mediated model, preparedness significantly predicted the
amount of funding (b = .16, t(109) = 1.94, p < .05). The second step suggests that the
independent variable (i.e., preparedness) significantly predicted the mediator, cognitive
legitimacy (b = .26, t(109) = 4.50, p < .001). In step three of the mediation model, cognitive legitimacy predicted the amount of funding (b = .27, t(108) = 1.98, p < .05) with
preparedness in the model. When the variance of cognitive legitimacy was partialled,
however, the relation between preparedness and amount of funding did not remain significant (b = .09, t(108) = 1.02, p = .31). Thus, results support full mediation.
Consistent with best practices, bootstrap results (n = 5,000) computed using the
INDIRECT macro (Preacher & Hayes, 2008)5 provided evidence of full mediation as well
(bootstrap 95% confidence interval [.00; .18]). The estimated indirect effect calculated
from the original sample was .068, and the mean of the indirect effect estimates calculated
across all bootstrap samples was .071. This final model was robust despite the relations
between the two covariates, entrepreneurial experience (b = .12, t(108) = 2.05, p < .05),
and responsiveness to feedback (b = -.22, t(108) = -2.46, p < .05), being significantly
related to amount of funding (See Figure 1).

Discussion
In this research, we sought to investigate antecedents of funding decisions made by
financiers in response to entrepreneurs’ business pitches. In sum, we provide evidence to
5. The INDIRECT macro is far superior to the SOBEL macro as it “allows for more than one mediator and
adjusts all paths for the potential influence of covariates not proposed to be mediators in the model.” See the

<-----Page 17----->support the contention that preparedness behaviors are positively related to perceived
cognitive legitimacy and, in turn, cognitive legitimacy predicts amount of funding. Specifically, results supported hypothesis 1, which proposed a positive relation between
preparedness behaviors and amount of funding received from financiers. These data,
accordingly, support a growing literature highlighting the important role of entrepreneurial preparedness. This work bolsters work of such researchers as Chen et al. (2009) and
Cardon et al. (2009) who illustrate the role of preparedness in positively impacting
venture funding decisions.
We extended this research, though, by examining the theoretically derived mediating
mechanism through which preparedness impacts performance: cognitive legitimacy.
Results illustrated support for hypothesis 2, which proposed a positive relation between
cognitive legitimacy and amount of funding received. And, consistent with our theoretical
framework, results also confirmed hypothesis 3, which posited the positive relation
between preparedness and cognitive legitimacy. Finally, we found support for hypothesis
4, which proposed that cognitive legitimacy mediates the relation between preparedness
and amount of funding received. Though legitimacy in new firms has gained traction in the
entrepreneurship literature (e.g., Choi & Shepherd, 2005; Rutherford & Buller, 2007;
Tornikoski & Newbert, 2007), measurement of the construct has remained virtually
nonexistent. While exceptions exist (e.g., Choi & Shepherd), we submit here that our
measure related to cognitive legitimacy is more theoretically robust than other extant
measures. Additionally, our empirical justification that legitimacy does seem to precede
temporally the granting of resources, in the psychological chain of events, is a noteworthy
contribution. This follows the work of some more recent studies (Delmar & Shane, 2004;
Rutherford et al., 2009), indicating that new venture entrepreneurs should focus on
achieving legitimacy and not necessarily on directly acquiring financial resources.
Resources will be granted after legitimacy is achieved.
In addition to extending the literatures related to preparedness as well as legitimacy,
we also contribute to the work on narrative sensemaking. Though extant research has
examined how the written narratives entrepreneurs present affect initial public offering
valuations (Martens, Jennings, & Jennings, 2007), no research has empirically examined
narratives in the new, or nascent, venture context. Overall, the majority of work is
conceptual (e.g., O’Connor, 2002). Our work, thus, provides a novel context (i.e., new
and/or nascent ventures) and novel mode of communication (i.e., verbal “pitches”) in
which to study the venture capitalist–entrepreneur dyad. Work such as O’Connor, as well
as Anderson (2005), which built on the narrative sensemaking literature from Weick can
look to the present research as additional affirmation of the crucial role of narratives in
the domain of entrepreneurship. Additionally, within this communication framework, we
more accurately characterize the behavior of preparedness as communication behavior. In
doing so, we shed light on how, specifically, this behavior leads to positive funding
decisions made by investors.
Additionally, on a practical note, we offer a summary of the process of how opportunities are eventually funded in the new venture context. We advance our knowledge of
the relationship between pitching behaviors and decision making. This is an area that must
be closely examined if the dynamics of the venture funding process are to be more
fully understood (MacMillian, Kulow, & Khoylian, 1989; Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996).
Interest in investigating how the execution of the pitch by the entrepreneur may lead to the
forging of the financial bond between the many types of investors and the entrepreneur has
been growing (e.g., Baron & Brush, 1999; Baum & Locke, 2004; Chen et al., 2009).
However, the lack of empirical research in this area is surprising, given the importance of
the pitch to entrepreneurship researchers (e.g., Ireland & Hitt, 1997), as well as practicing
18

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 18----->entrepreneurs and their advocates (e.g., Kawasaki, 2004, 2008). We build on this limited
literature (e.g., Baron & Markman, 2000; Elsbach, 2003; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001), and
the present research adds credence to the growing sentiment that shows how entrepreneurs’ business pitches (i.e., narrative stories) build rapport with key stakeholders.
For instance, in order to pitch effectively to potential investors, entrepreneurs must
address multiple key questions such as: “What is the customers’ pain?” “How does the
product/service alleviate that pain?” “Is the solution affordable?” “Can the management
team execute effectively and generate sufficient cash flow?” “What is the secret sauce?”
(Kawasaki, 2004, 2008).6 Based on the current findings, entrepreneurs who are prepared
and who tell a cohesive narrative regarding their business may be able to addresses these
questions more effectively than less prepared entrepreneurs. Accordingly, we extend the
efforts of those entrepreneurship theorists and researchers who have in the past focused on
the agency theory and transaction costs views of entrepreneur–investor relationships
(Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996; Steier & Greenwood, 1995). The present work, accordingly, provides theoretical advances in the literature as well as practical, actionable, advice
to entrepreneurs seeking funding in a pitch-based setting.
Finally, one additional contribution of the present work is that we further refine an
emerging methodological technique: coding data from media sources. A growing body of
empirical research is based on coding of data from sources such as the media (e.g.,
newspapers, Anderson & Warren, 2011; television, Maxwell et al., 2011). Though work in
other domains is prevalent (e.g., the medical field, Diem et al., 1996; Østbye et al., 1997),
techniques such as these are just now gaining traction within the domain of entrepreneurship. We hope that the methods and results of the present work encourage future exploration of this type.
In sum, our primary contribution is the modeling of how entrepreneurs’ preparedness
behavior affects funding decisions by investors. By highlighting the construct of cognitive
legitimacy, and validating its measurement, we provide theoretical clarification—
cognitive legitimacy is the mediating mechanism through which preparedness behavior
influences funding decisions. This contribution to the literature provides a model by which
researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors can clearly understand how funding decisions
are made and, potentially, influenced.

Limitations and Future Directions for Research
Our unique sample, empirical model, and subsequent results provide a compelling
case for the value-added nature of the present contribution. However, this study has
notable limitations. First, the degree to which these results are generalizable is questionable. Although evidence exists to suggest that external validity is intact (e.g., Maxwell
et al., 2011), perhaps, at some level, these entrepreneurs and their firms were screened to
meet the needs of the producers, directors, and television audiences, and therefore may not
truly represent the universe of entrepreneurs. Second, we were not able to collect data
related to alternative types of legitimacy (e.g., normative, regulative) or the actual age
and/or size of the firm. Age and size data were available for only a very limited number
of pitches. Third, our data involved the coding of episodes by trained student research
assistants—though the use of trained coders is an acceptable methodology (e.g., Maxwell
et al., these relations would benefit from replication utilizing a different sample of
investors. Fourth, our sample size limited the number of relations that we could

<-----Page 19----->empirically test—therefore, many questions remain. Moving forward, for example, future
research could examine the mediating role of other types of legitimacy. Investigating
normative, regulatory, sociopolitical, and industry legitimacy in this context would benefit
both researchers and practitioners alike. Additionally, along these lines, we did not
examine differences across industries—industry affiliation can affect resource needs and
funding requests. Future research is encouraged to explore differences across industries
related to funding, preparedness, and legitimacy. Finally, we focused solely on the pitches
that received funding in a televised setting. Within this setting, the average amount
of funding sought (M = $117,307, SD = $84,665) relative to funding received (M =
$188,486, SD = $113,574) exhibited a bivariate correlation of .82. Along these lines, to
expand and replicate the present work, future research may find value and add to the
literature to the extent that (1) comparisons between successful (i.e., funded) versus
unsuccessful (i.e., not funded) pitches can be examined; (2) pitches in different contexts
(e.g., in person, video, webcast) can be examined; and (3) alternative criteria for success
(e.g., publicity, valuable learning, marketing) can be assessed.
We maintain this manuscript adds to the literature by virtue of building upon and
extending the current base of theory with regard to the attainment of entrepreneurial
resources. However, this literature is still in its infancy and many compelling lines of
research are becoming apparent. In addition to the directions noted above, we see
several other interesting lines of inquiry. We advocate further development of the
legitimacy construct based on the recent works in the literature (e.g., Bitekline, 2011).
Certainly, all 18 legitimacy types identified by Bitekline could, and should, be subjected
to additional measurement development. However, we agree with those scholars
(e.g., Choi & Shepherd, 2005) who feel strongly that the construct of cognitive legitimacy holds special promise for the field of entrepreneurship. We believe that we
develop and employ a robust and reliable measure, but it should be subjected to additional empirical scrutiny. If an agreed upon measure of cognitive legitimacy is validated,
many unanswered questions in the entrepreneurship domain might be answered by
future research.

Conclusion
The importance of the acquisition of resources to enable entrepreneurs to found new
ventures is undeniable. Unfortunately for nascent entrepreneurs, investment decisions
related to their aspirations are usually plagued with uncertainty and information asymmetry concerns that hamper potential investors’ abilities to gauge the financial viabilities
of proposed new ventures (Venkataraman, 1997). However, fortunately for those seeking
financial backing, social factors, behaviors, and relationship elements are used in interactive trade-off exercises formulated by equity investors, combating the detrimental
uncertainty linked to the investment process (MacMillan, Siegel, & Narasimha, 1985;
Muzyka, Birley, & Leleux, 1996).
Accordingly, entrepreneurs seeking funding have the opportunity, via the business
pitch, to enact behaviors that foster perceptions of preparedness and legitimacy. This
legitimacy, in turn, can positively influence funding decisions. In the present research, we
established that preparedness is positively related to perceptions of cognitive legitimacy.
