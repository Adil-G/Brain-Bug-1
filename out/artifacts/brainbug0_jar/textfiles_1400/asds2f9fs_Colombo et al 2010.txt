Young innovative ﬁrms that operate in high-tech industries (new technology-based
ﬁrms, NTBFs) play a crucial role for employment creation, for the development of
radically new technologies, and more generally, for the growth and competitiveness
of the economic system (Audretsch 1995). However, these ﬁrms ﬁnd it more diﬃcult
than their larger, more established counterparts to obtain access to external
ﬁnancing (Carpenter and Petersen 2002; Hall 2002; Denis 2004) and other external
resources. In turn, lack of adequate resources hurts the development of these ﬁrms
and may even threaten their survival, with obvious negative eﬀects on social welfare.
Scholars, practitioners and policy makers agree that venture capital (VC) potentially
has a crucial beneﬁcial eﬀect on NTBFs, as it can alleviate the above mentioned
problems. Accordingly, NTBFs and VC have increasingly attracted the attention of
policy makers (BEPA 2008).
In particular, the last decade has witnessed several attempts by both
European governments and the European Union to foster the creation of
US-style venture capital industries as a necessary preliminary step to support
the generation of high-tech ‘gazelles’, that is, innovative high-growth entrepreneurial ventures. This key sector of the European economy is rather weak in
comparison with international competitors, especially that in the USA. However, the policy schemes to support both VC and NTBFs adopted by the
European countries have been quite heterogeneous and have obtained mixed or
unsatisfactory results.
The years 2008 and 2009 further exacerbated these challenges. Many things
changed during these years. The economic crisis hit directly the private equity
industry. VC companies are no longer able to raise funds and ﬁnance new
investments. The crisis has also ampliﬁed existing problems of NTBFs arising from
lack of resources. While large companies can use the ﬁnancial markets or ﬁnd
ﬁnancing from sovereign funds, European SMEs, in particular NTBFs, have serious
diﬃculties in ﬁnding long-term ﬁnancing. One of the main issues for economic policy
in coming years will be to ensure the long-term ﬁnancing of SMEs, and particularly
of innovative SMEs. A greater understanding, on the one hand, of the determinants
for VC companies to back high-tech ﬁrms and, on the other hand, of the eﬀects of

VC investments on the innovative activity of the invested ﬁrms, is necessary to better
design public intervention in this domain.
While there have been substantial VC investments in high-tech sectors during the
2000s, a number of major aspects are little understood. First, is the speciﬁcity and
heterogeneity of high-tech VC investment. Second, much research focuses on the US
context where VC ﬁrms are described as the engine of job growth nurturing start-ups
as Microsoft, Apple, Google, yet the history of VC and the institutional environment
in the US contrast strongly with that prevailing elsewhere. This special issue aims to
go some way towards ﬁlling the gap in our understanding of the process of VC
investment in environments outside the US.
The three papers presented in this special issue have beneﬁted from the comments
of the editors, the blind reviewers and from the participants at the seminar on ‘The
dynamics of science-based entrepreneurship’ organized in April 2008 in Sestri
Levante (Italy) and the seminar on ‘Venture capital and European high-tech startups: A new rationale for policy making?’ organized in May 2008 in Milan. Both
seminars beneﬁted from the support of the PRIME Network of Excellence funded by
the FP6 of the European Union.
Role of venture capital for high-tech ﬁrms
In order to stimulate VC activities, a host of factors need to be taken into account.
These include, among other things, the fact that the investment objectives, time
horizons and capabilities of diﬀerent types of VC investors vary, and thus policy
initiatives are not likely to have expected outcomes if this is not taken into account.
Moreover, the supply of VC ﬁnancing in diﬀerent countries and industries is aﬀected
by the characteristics of the business environment (e.g. industry growth rate,
innovation intensity, capital intensity), the institutional environment (e.g. opportunities of exit for VC investors, level of corporate taxes, labour market rigidity,
technology policy schemes), the regulatory framework (e.g. constraints to the
investment activity of pension funds and insurance companies, constraints to IPOs,
barriers to the creation of new companies), and macroeconomic factors, such as
interest rates, interest rates spreads, and GDP growth, among others.
The importance of VC ﬁnancing for the development of knowledge-intensive
industries and ﬁrms stems from a number of reasons, including the fact that VC
investors provide liquidity and help in the selection of the most promising ventures
for growth. Scholars, practitioners and policy makers agree that adequate early stage
ﬁnancing is a crucial factor for the success of NTBFs at foundation and during the
early stage of their life. However, the importance of VC goes far beyond the ﬁnancial
support of technology-based ventures. In addition to ﬁnancial resources, VC
investors provide portfolio companies with a complex bundle of value-adding
activities (e.g. Gorman and Sahlman 1989; Sapienza 1992; Sapienza, Manigart, and
Vermeir 1996; Kaplan and Strömberg 2004). External investors directly add value to
portfolio ﬁrms by ‘coaching’, that is giving them ﬁnancial, administrative,
marketing, strategy and management support, and by fostering their managerial
‘professionalization’ (Hellmann and Puri 2002; Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann
2008). NTBFs especially lack these capabilities.
VC investors can also extend the social capital of portfolio companies through
their network of contacts in the business community; this helps portfolio companies
gain access to specialized professional services and establish alliances with third

parties (Colombo, Grilli, and Piva 2006; Hsu 2006; Lindsey 2008). The contribution
of VC investors could also be indirect because their investments convey a credible
signal of ﬁrm’s quality to third parties (i.e. to customers, alliance partners, skilled
workers and other ﬁnancial intermediaries; cf. Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels 1999).
Despite an increasing pool of literature on the value-adding activities of VC
investors, there are important questions which need to be further clariﬁed. These
questions include the characteristics of both investors and new ventures which aﬀect
the investment and the extent and eﬀectiveness of value-adding behaviour of VC
investors. These characteristics especially pertain to the human and social capital of
the investors and the founders of new ventures, but also to other aspects, such as the
investor types, the origin and stage of new ventures, and the technological and
industrial sectors in which the ventures operate. For instance, independent,
corporate and public VC investors diﬀer in terms of their investment objectives,
time horizons and capabilities to ‘coach’ their portfolio ﬁrms, and these factors
inﬂuence the value-adding activities of the investors both in terms of the degree to
which they engage in them and the eﬀectiveness of the actions. Thus, for example,
the signalling eﬀect of VC ﬁnancing will ultimately depend on the reputation of the
investor (Hsu 2004), or coaching is likely to be the more eﬀective, the greater the
human and social capital of the investor (Dimov and Shepherd 2005; Knockaert
et al. 2006).
Contribution to ﬁlling the research and policy gap
In aiming to contribute to ﬁlling the research and policy gap in our understanding of
the role of VC for NTBFs, this special issue addresses the following aspects. First, we
focus on the relationships between VC and high-tech start-ups in European
countries. The ﬁrst paper (Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett) is based on seven
regions across Northern Europe: Cambridge/London region (UK), Ile-de-France
(France), Flanders (Belgium), North Holland (the Netherlands), Bavaria (Germany),
Stockholm region (Sweden), Helsinki region (Finland). The second (Ortı́n-Ángel and
Vendrell-Herrero) and third (Bertoni, Croce, and D’Adda) papers describe the
situation in two south European countries, respectively Spain and Italy. Second, this
special issue adopts a multi-level approach to examine the process of VC investment
in technological start-ups in that it explores both the investor and investee ﬁrm sides.
Third, the authors of these papers utilize both extensive qualitative studies and
statistical and econometric techniques to examine these diﬀerent levels of the
process. Last but not least, these three papers adopt a comparative perspective: the
ﬁrst (Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett) compares in a population of European early
stage investors technology investors vs. traditional investors; the second paper
(Ortı́n-Ángel and Vendrell-Herrero) compares in a population of Spanish
technological ﬁrms university spin-oﬀs vs. independent NTBFs; the last one
(Bertoni, Croce, and D’Adda) compares in a population of Italian NTBFs
VC-backed vs. non VC-backed NTBFs.
Behind these common points about their European context, their data and
methodology, the three papers address three complementary issues to understand the
relationship between VC and technological start-ups. The ﬁrst one is about the
investors themselves, the second one is about the attractiveness of technological
ﬁrms for VC investors and the third one concerns the impact of VC ﬁnance on the
innovation output of these ﬁrms.

In their paper, ‘Are technology VC investors a distinct species on the investment
market?’, Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett address the following question: do
technology investors diﬀer from traditional investors? As stunning as it may sound,
although the literature has suggested that technology investing is diﬀerent from nontech investing, no research has focused on what distinguishes technology investors
from traditional ones. Moreover, researchers who suggest that technology investing
is diﬀerent from traditional investing haven’t provided a deﬁnition of technology
investing, nor provided an indication of the reason for the diﬀerences between these
investors and traditional investors. The development of a theoretical framework for
explaining diﬀerences between these two types of investors is an important result of
this ﬁrst paper. Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett used a hand-collected, unique
dataset of early stage European VC investors. They identiﬁed 28 technology
investors from a sample of 68 European early stage investors in seven regions across
Northern Europe to analyse the extent to which technology investors are diﬀerent
from traditional ones based on the emphasis investment managers placed on hightech selection criteria, such as protectability and general purpose technology. Their
comparison of these two groups brings interesting results. First, publicly funded
funds do not emphasize technology-related criteria more than traditional investors.
In other words, technology investors were not more likely to receive public funding
than traditional investors. Secondly, the speciﬁc human capital of investment
managers is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between technology investors and traditional ones,
especially at the level of previous investment management and consulting experience.
Investment managers with higher levels of these types of human capital tend to
emphasize high-tech related criteria to a larger extent. To summarize, technology
investors had more investment management experience and more consulting
experience than traditional investors.
Understanding the nature of technological start-ups which received VC money is
an important issue, particularly in Europe, where public policies have tried to foster
the creation of university spin-oﬀ ﬁrms. The literature has shown the diﬀerences
between university spin-oﬀs and other NTBFs (Ensley and Hmieleski 2005;
Colombo and Piva 2008). In the second paper of this special issue, Ortı́n-Ángel
and Vendrell-Herrero provide an analysis of the consequences of such diﬀerences on
the presence of venture capitalists. They showed that the existing literature has
analysed the factors explaining the variability in the presence of venture capitalists
within high-tech start-ups, but remains silent about the variability between university
spin-oﬀs and independent start-ups. To answer their question ‘Why do university
spin-oﬀs attract more venture capitalists?’ they used a questionnaire answered by a
sample of 64 Spanish technological ﬁrms founded between the years 1993 and 2005,
which included 40 university spin-oﬀs and 24 high-tech independent start-ups. The
authors found that on average, university spin-oﬀs are more likely to have VC than
independent start-ups. In their sample, this is explained by the greater presence of
venture capitalists in those university spin-oﬀs whose founding team has a lack of
managerial skills. These results support the complementary assets view that
academic entrepreneurs use VC investors as a means of gaining access to managerial
skills.
The ﬁrst paper of this special issue is about VC investors (and about the
diﬀerence between technology investors and traditional ones). The second paper
concerns the attractiveness of diﬀerent types of high-tech start-ups for VC investors.
The third and last paper continues this journey in addressing the issue of the eﬀects

of the VC investment in high-tech start-ups. More precisely, Bertoni, Croce, and
D’Adda analysed the impact of VC ﬁnance on the innovation output of NTBFs as
reﬂected by their patenting activity. Only a limited literature has analysed the ﬁrmlevel eﬀect of VC investments on innovation. Their paper ‘Venture capital
investments and patenting activity of high-tech start-ups: a micro-econometric
ﬁrm-level analysis’ is an important contribution to this literature. The authors
examine the eﬀect of VC investment on ﬁrms’ patenting activities using ﬁrm-level
longitudinal data on a sample of 351 Italian NTBFs that operate in high-tech
manufacturing and software, 33 of which are VC-backed. Their results show that a
ﬁrm’s propensity to patent is signiﬁcantly higher for VC-backed ﬁrms than for their
non-VC-backed counterparts. Moreover both the likelihood of obtaining one or
more patents and the number of granted patents increase signiﬁcantly after a ﬁrm
receives the ﬁrst round of VC. Last but not least, VC-backed ﬁrms do not exhibit
such a high patenting propensity before receiving VC. Their results clearly support
the view that VC is beneﬁcial to ﬁrms’ innovation. The ﬁndings of these three papers
provide some important implications for policy makers, entrepreneurs and VC
funds. As suggested by the results of paper one, policy makers should focus on –
especially in VC companies which received money from public funds – how
investment managers can be recruited that have specialist technology skills on the
one hand and investment management skills on the other. The results of paper two
show that university spin-oﬀs with founders that have a lack of managerial skills
could be more interested in incorporating VC than other high-tech ﬁrms. As a
corollary, policies facilitating contact, information transmission and trust between
venture capitalists and Technological Transfer Oﬃces (TTOs) could enhance and
stimulate the extension of VC, especially among these types of ﬁrms. Lastly, the third
paper shows a dramatic positive inﬂuence of VC investments on NTBFs’ patent
activity. This result supports the view that the development of VC ﬁnancing should,
despite the current crisis, be a prominent part of the innovation policy agenda in
Europe.
The papers of this special issue have also a number of implications for
entrepreneurs looking for VC ﬁnancing. From paper one, it is clear that there are
technology investors who stress strong technological criteria in the business plan.
This may be of interest to many early stage high-tech companies, often lacking ﬁrst
customer contracts, a well-established entrepreneurial team or clearly identiﬁable
ﬁnancial prospects. In addition, entrepreneurs operating in the biotech industry
should be aware of the importance attached by investment managers responsible for
biotech investing to high-tech criteria such as protectability of technology. The idea
emerges from paper two that university entrepreneurs must be especially aware of
their managerial capabilities and experience. If the founding team has suﬃcient
managerial skills, VC seems to be a last resort for obtaining resources, particularly if
their innovations are not (or cannot be) well protected. But, in the cases where their
managerial experience is low, venture capitalists can be a complement in gaining
access to such abilities. Similarly, as is apparent from paper three, VC seems to be
especially suitable to speed up the innovation activity of NTBFs.
Finally, paper one also has implications at the level of VC funds. It indicates that
investment managers are not biased by their own technical background when
analysing high-tech proposals. This may indicate that they align to a large extent to
the investment policy set by the VC fund. It further links speciﬁc human capital to a
higher inclination towards technology investing.
