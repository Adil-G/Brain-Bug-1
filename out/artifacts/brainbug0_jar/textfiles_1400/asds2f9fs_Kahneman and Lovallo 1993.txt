Decision

makers have a strong tendency to consider problems as unique. They isolate the
current choice from future opportunities and neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating
current plans. Overly cautious attitudes to risk result from a failure to appreciate the effects of
statistical aggregation in mitigating relative risk. Overly optimistic forecasts result from the
adoption of an inside view of the problem, which anchors predictions on plans and scenarios.
The conflicting biases are documented in psychological research. Possible implications for decision making in organizations are examined.

ManagerialCognition)
(DecisionMaking;Risk;Forecasting;

The thesis of this essay is that decision makers are excessively prone to treat problems as unique, neglecting
both the statistics of the past and the multiple opportunities of the future. In part as a result, they are susceptible to two biases, which we label isolation errors:
their forecasts of future outcomes are often anchored
on plans and scenarios of success rather than on past
results, and are therefore overly optimistic; their evaluations of single risky prospects neglect the possibilities
of pooling risks and are therefore overly timid. We argue
that the balance of the two isolation errors affects the
risk-taking propensities of individuals and organizations.
The cognitive analysis of risk taking that we sketch
differs from the standard rational model of economics
and also from managers' view of their own activities.
The rational model describes business decisions as
choices among gambles with financial outcomes, and
assumes that managers' judgments of the odds are
Bayesian, and that their choices maximize expected
utility. In this model, uncontrollable risks are acknowledged and accepted because they are compensated by
chances of gain. As March and Shapira ( 1987) reported
in a well-known essay, managers reject this interpretation of their role, preferring to view risk as a challenge
to be overcome by the exercise of skill and choice as a

commitment to a goal. Although managers do not deny
the possibility of failure, their idealized self-image is
not a gambler but a prudent and determined agent, who
is in control of both people and events.
The cognitive analysis accepts choice between gambles as a model of decision making, but does not adopt
rationality as a maintained hypothesis. The gambling
metaphor is apt because the consequences of most decisions are uncertain, and because each option could in
principle be described as a probability distribution over
outcomes. However, rather than suppose that decision
makers are Bayesian forecasters and optimal gamblers,
we shall describe them as subject to the conflicting biases
of unjustified optimism and unreasonable risk aversion.
It is the optimistic denial of uncontrollable uncertainty
that accounts for managers' views of themselves as
prudent risk takers, and for their rejection of gambling
as a model of what they do.
Our essay develops this analysis of forecasting and
choice and explores its implications for organizational
decisions. The target domain for applications includes
choices about potentially attractive options that decision
makers consider significant and to which they are willing
to devote forecasting and planning resources. Examples
may be capital investment projects, new products, or
acquisitions. For reasons that will become obvious, our

critique of excessive risk aversion is most likely to apply
to decisions of intermediate size: large enough to matter
for the organization, but not so large as to be truly
unique, or potentially fatal. Of course, such decisions
could be perceived as both unique and potentially fatal
by the executive who makes them. Two other restrictions on the present treatment should be mentioned at
the outset. First, we do not deal with decisions that the
organization explicitly treats as routinely repeated. Opportunities for learning and for statistical aggregation
exist when closely similar problems are frequently encountered, especially if the outcomes of decisions are
quickly known and provide unequivocal feedback;
competent management will ensure that these opportunities are exploited. Second, we do not deal with decisions made under severely adverse conditions, when
all options are undesirable. These are situations in which
high-risk gambles are often preferred to the acceptance
of sure losses (Kahneman and Tversky 1979a), and in
which commitments often escalate and sunk costs
dominate decisions (Staw and Ross 1989). We restrict
the treatment to choices among options that can be
considered attractive, although risky. For this class of
projects we predict that there will be a general tendency
to underestimate actual risks, and a general reluctance
to accept significant risks once they are acknowledged.

Timid Choices
We begin by reviewing three hypotheses about individual preferences for risky prospects.
Risk Aversion. The first hypothesis is a commonplace: most people are generally risk averse, normally
preferring a sure thing to a gamble of equal expected
value, and a gamble of low variance over a riskier prospect. There are two important exceptions to risk aversion. First, many people are willing to pay more for
lottery tickets than their expected value. Second, studies
of individual choice have shown that managers, like
other people, are risk-seeking in the domain of losses
(Bateman and Zeithaml 1989, Fishburn and Kochenberger 1979, Laughhunn et al. 1980).1 Except for these
1 Observed correlations between accounting variability and mean return have also been interpreted as evidence of risk-seeking by unsuccessful firms (Bowman 1982, Fiegenbaum 1990, Fiegenbaum and
Thomas 1988), but this interpretation is controversial (Ruefli 1990).

cases, and for the behavior of addictive gamblers, risk
aversion is prevalent in choices between favorable
prospects with known probabilities. This result has been
confirmed in numerous studies, including some in which
the subjects were executives (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986, Swalm 1966).2
The standard interpretation of risk aversion is decreasing marginal utility of gains. Prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979a; Tversky and Kahneman 1986, 1992) introduced two other causes: the certainty effect and loss aversion. The certainty effect is a
sharp discrepancy between the weights that are attached
to sure gains and to highly probable gains in the evaluation of prospects. In a recent study of preferences for
gambles the decision weight for a probability of 0.95
was approximately 0.80 (Tversky and Kahneman 1992).
Loss aversion refers to the observation that losses and
disadvantages are weighted more than gains and advantages. Loss aversion affects decision making in numerous ways, in riskless as well as in risky contexts. It
favors inaction over action and the status quo over any
alternatives, because the disadvantages of these alternatives are evaluated as losses and are therefore
weighted more than their advantages (Kahneman et al.
1991, Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988, Tversky and
Kahneman 1991). Loss aversion strongly favors the
avoidance of risks. The coefficient of loss aversion was
estimated as about 2 in the Tversky-Kahneman experiment, and coefficients in the range of 2 to 2.5 have
been observed in several studies, with both risky and
riskless prospects (for reviews, see Kahneman, Knetsch
and Thaler 1991; Tversky and Kahneman 1991).
A second important generNear-Proportionality.
alization about risk attitudes is that, to a good first approximation, people are proportionately risk averse: cash
equivalents for gambles of increasing size are (not quite)
proportional to the stakes. Readers may find it instructive to work out their cash equivalent for a 0.50 chance
to win $100, then $1,000, and up to $100,000. Most
readers will find that their cash equivalent increases by
a factor of less than 1,000 over that range, but most
will also find that the factor is more than 700. Exact
2 A possible exception is a study by Wehrung (1989), which reported

risk-neutral preferences for favorable prospects in a sample of executives in oil companies.

proportionality for wholly positive prospects would imply that value is a power function, u (x) = xa, where x
is the amount of gain (Keeney and Raiffa 1976). In a
recent study of preferences for gambles (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992), a power function provided a good
approximation to the data over almost two orders of
magnitude, and the deviations were systematic: cash
equivalents increased slightly more slowly than prizes.
Much earlier, Swalm (1966) had compared executives
whose planning horizons, defined as twice the maximum amount they might recommend be spent in one
year, ranged from $50,000 to $24,000,000. He measured
their utility functions by testing the acceptability of
mixed gambles, and observed that the functions of
managers at different levels were quite similar when
expressed relative to their planning horizons. The point
on which we focus in this article is that there is almost
as much risk aversion when stakes are small as when
they are large. This is unreasonable on two grounds:
(i) small gambles do not raise issues of survival or ruin,
which provide a rationale for aversion to large risks;
(ii) small gambles are usually more common, offering
more opportunities for the risk-reducing effects of statistical aggregation.
Narrow Decision Frames. The third generalization
is that people tend to consider decision problems one
at a time, often isolating the current problem from other
choices that may be pending, as well as from future
opportunities to make similar decisions. The following
example (from Tversky and Kahneman 1986) illustrates
an extreme form of narrow framing:
Imagine that you face the following pair of concurrentdecisions.
First examine both decisions, then indicate the options you
prefer.
Decision (i) Choose between:
(A) a sure gain of $240 (84%)
(B) 25% chance to gain $1000,and 75% chance to gain nothing
(16%)
Decision (ii) Choose between:
(C) a sure loss of $750 (13%)
(D) 75% chance to lose $1000 and 25% chance to lose nothing
(87%)

discovered for themselves, the suggestion that the two

fect on preferences, which exhibit the common pattern
of risk aversion when options are favorable, and risk
seeking when options are aversive. Most respondents
prefer the conjunction of options A & D over other
combinations of options. These preferences are intuitively compelling, and there is no obvious reason to
suspect that they could lead to trouble. However, simple
arithmetic shows that the conjunction of preferred options A & D is dominated by the conjunction of rejected
options B & C. The combined options are as follows:
A & D: 25% chance to win $240 and 75% chance to lose $760,
B & C: 25% chance to win $250 and 75% chance to lose $750.

A decision maker who is risk averse in some situations
and risk seeking in others ends up paying a premium
to avoid some risks and a premium to obtain others.
Because the outcomes are ultimately combined, these
payments may be unsound. For a more realistic example,
consider two divisions of a company that face separate
decision problems.3 One is in bad posture and faces a
choice between a sure loss and a high probability of a
larger loss; the other division faces a favorable choice.
The natural bent of intuition will favor a risk-seeking
solution for one and a risk-averse choice for the other,
but the conjunction could be poor policy. The overall
interests of the company are better served by aggregating the problems than by segregating them, and by
a policy that is generally more risk-neutral than intuitive
preferences.
People often express different preferences when considering a single play or multiple plays of the same
gamble. In a well-known problem devised by Samuelson (1963), many respondents state that they would
reject a single play of a gamble in which they have
equal chances to win $200 or to lose $100, but would
accept multiple plays of that gamble, especially when
the compound distribution of outcomes is made explicit
(Redelmeier and Tversky 1992). The question of
whether this pattern of preferences is consistent with
utility theory, and with particular utility functions for
wealth has been discussed on several occasions (e.g.,
Lopes 1981, Tversky and Bar-Hillel 1983). The argument that emerges from these discussions can be summarized as "If you wish to obey the axioms of utility
'We are endebted to Amos Tversky for this example.

19

<-----Page 4----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

theory and would accept multiple plays, then it is logically inconsistent for you to turn down a single play".
We focus on another observation: the near-certainty that
the individual who is now offered a single play of the
Samuelson gamble is not really facing her last opportunity to accept or reject a gamble of positive expected
value. This suggests a slightly different argument: "If
you would accept multiple plays, then you should accept
the single one that is offered now, because it is very
probable that other bets of the same kind will be offered
to you later". A frame that includes future opportunities
reduces the difference between the two versions of
Samuelson's problem, because a rational individual who
is offered a single gamble will adopt a policy for m + 1
such gambles, where m is the number of similar opportunities expected within the planning horizon. Will
people spontaneously adopt such a broad frame? A
plausible hypothesis, supported by the evidence for
narrow framing in concurrent decisions and by the pattern of answers to Samuelson's problems, is that expectations about risky opportunities of the future are
simply ignored when decisions are made.
It is generally recognized that a broad view of decision
problems is an essential requirement of rational decision
making. There are several ways of broadening the decision frame. Thus, decision analysts commonly prescribe that concurrent choices should be aggregated before a decision is made, and that outcomes should be
evaluated in terms of final assets (wealth), rather than
in terms of the gains and losses associated with each
move. The recommended practice is to include estimates
of future earnings in the assessment of wealth. Although
this point has attracted little attention in the decision
literature, the wealth of an agent or organization therefore includes future risky choices, and depends on the
decisions that the decision maker anticipates making
when these choices arise.4 The decision frame should
be broadened to include these uncertainties: neglect of
future risky opportunities will lead to decisions that are
not optimal, as evaluated by the agent's own utility
function. As we show next, the costs of neglecting future
4 Two agents that have the same current holdings and face the same
series of risky choices do not have the same wealth if they have
different attitudes to risk and expect to make different decisions. For
formal discussions of choice in the presence of unresolved uncertainty,

opportunities are especially severe when options are
evaluated in terms of gains and losses, which is what
people usually do.

The Costs of Isolation
The present section explores some consequences of incorporating future choice opportunities into current decisions. We start from an idealized utility function which
explains people's proportional risk preferences for single
gambles. We then compute the preferences that this
function implies when the horizon expands to include
a portfolio of gambles.
Consider an individual who evaluates outcomes as
gains and losses, and who maximizes expected utility
in these terms. This decision maker is risk-averse in the
domain of gains, risk-seeking in the domain of losses,
loss-averse, and her risky choices exhibit perfect proportionality. She is indifferent between a 0.50 chance
to win $1,000 and a sure gain of $300 (also between
0.50 chance to win $10,000 and $3,000 for sure) and
she is also indifferent between the status quo and a
gamble that offers equal chances to win $250 or to lose
$100. The aversion to risk exhibited by this individual
is above the median of respondents in laboratory studies, but well within the range of observed values. For
the sake of simple exposition we ignore all probability
distortions and attribute the risk preferences of the individual entirely to the shape of her utility function for
gains and losses. The preferences we have assumed imply that the individual's utility for gains is described by
a power function with an exponent of 0.575 and that
the function in the domain of losses is the mirror image
of the function for gains, after expansion of the X-axis
by a factor of 2.5 (Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The
illustrative function was chosen to highlight our main
conclusion: with proportional risk attitudes, even the
most extreme risk aversion on individual problems
quickly vanishes when gambles are considered part of
a portfolio.
The power utility function is decreasingly risk averse,
and the decrease is quite rapid. Thus, a proportionately
risk averse individual who values a 0.50 chance to win
$100 at $30 will value a gamble that offers equal chances
to win either $1,000 or $1,100 at $1,049. This preference
is intuitively acceptable, indicating again that the power
function is a good description of the utility of outcomes

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOL 39, No. 1, January 1993

<-----Page 5----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

for single gambles considered in isolation. The power
function fits the psychophysical relation of subjective
magnitude to physical magnitude in many other contexts (Stevens 1975).
To appreciate the effects of even modest aggregation
with this utility function, assume that the individual
owns three independent gambles:
one gamble with a 0.50 chance to win $500,
two gambles, each with a 0.50 chance to win $250.

Simple arithmetic yields the compound gamble:
0.125 chance to win $1,000, and 0.25 to win $750, $500, and
$250.

If this individual applies the correct probabilities to her
utility function, this portfolio will be worth $433 to her.
This should be her minimum selling price if she owns
the gamble, her cash equivalent if she has to choose
between the portfolio of gambles and cash. In contrast,
the sum of the cash equivalents of the gambles considered one at a time is only $300. The certainty premium
the individual would pay has dropped from 40% to
13% of expected value. By the individual's own utility
function, the cost of considering these gambles in isolation is 27% of their expected value, surely more than
any rational decision maker should be willing to pay
for whatever mental economy this isolation achieves.
The power of aggregation to overcome loss aversion
is equally impressive. As already noted, our decision
maker is indifferent between accepting or rejecting a
gamble that offers a 0.50 chance to win $250 and a 0.50
chance to lose $100. However, she would value the
opportunity to play two of these gambles at $45, and
six gambles at $304. Note that the average incremental
value of adding the third to the sixth gamble is $65,
quite close to the EV of $75, although each gamble is
worth nothing on its own.
Finally, we note that decisions about single gambles
will no longer appear risk-proportional when gambles
are evaluated in the context of a portfolio, even if the
utility function has that property. Suppose the individual now owns a set of eleven gambles:
one gamble with a 0.50 chance to win $1,000,
ten gambles, each with a 0.50 chances to win $100.

The expected value of the set is $1,000. If the gambles
were considered one at a time, the sum of their cash

MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993

equivalents would be only $600. With proper aggregation, however, the selling price for the package should
be $934. Now suppose the decision maker considers
trading only one of the gambles. After selling a gamble
for an amount X, she retains a reduced compound gamble in which the constant X is added to each outcome.
The decision maker, of course, will only sell if the value
of the new gamble is at least equal to the value of the
original portfolio. The computed selling price for the
larger gamble is $440, and the selling price for one of
the smaller gambles is $49. Note that the premium given
up to avoid the risk is 12% of expected value for the
large gamble, but only 2% for the small one. A rational
decision maker who applies a proportionately risk averse
utility function to aggregate outcomes will set cash
equivalents closer to risk neutrality for small gambles
than for large ones.
As these elementary examples illustrate, the common
attitude of strong (and proportional) aversion to risk
and to losses entails a risk policy that quickly approaches
neutrality as the portfolio is extended.5 Because possibilities of aggregation over future decisions always exist
for an ongoing concern, and because the chances for
aggregation are likely to be inversely correlated with
the size of the problem, the near-proportionality of risk
attitudes for gambles of varying sizes is logically incoherent, and the extreme risk aversion observed for
prospects that are small relative to assets is unreasonable. To rationalize observed preferences one must assume that the decision maker approaches each choice
problem as if it were her last-there seems to be no
relevant tomorrow. It is somewhat surprising that the
debate on the rationality of risky decisions has focused
almost exclusively on the curiosities of the Allais and
Ellsberg paradoxes, instead of on simpler observations,

5 The conclusions of the present section do not critically depend on
the assumption of expected utility theory, that the decision maker
weights outcomes by their probabilities. All the calculations reported
above were repeated using cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992) with plausible parameters (a = 0.73; b = c = 0.6
and a loss aversion coefficient of 2.5). Because extreme outcomes are
assigned greater weight in prospect theory than in the expected utility
model, the mitigation of risk aversion as the portfolio expands is
somewhat slower. Additionally, the risk seeking that prospect theory
predicts for single low-probability positive gambles is replaced by risk
aversion for repeated gambles.

such as the extraordinary myopia implied by extreme
and nearly proportional risk aversion.

Risk Taking in Organizations: Implications and
Speculations
The preceding sections discussed evidence that people,
when faced with explicitly probabilistic prospects in experimental situations, tend to frame their decision
problem narrowly, have near-proportional risk attitudes,
and are as a consequence excessively risk averse in small
decisions, where they ignore the effects of aggregation.
Extending these ideas to business decisions is necessarily
speculative, because the attitudes to risk that are implicit
in such decisions are not easily measured. One way to
approach this problem is by asking whether the organizational context in which many business decisions are
made is more likely to enhance or to inhibit risk aversion, narrow framing and near-proportionality. We examine this question in the present section.
Risk Aversion. There is little reason to believe that
the factors that produce risk aversion in the personal
evaluation of explicit gambles are neutralized in the
context of managerial decisions. For example, attempts
to measure the utility that executives attach to gains
and losses of their firm suggest that the principle of
decreasing marginal values applies to these outcomes
(MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986, Swalm 1966). The
underweighting of probable gains in comparisons with
sure ones, known as the certainty effect, is also unlikely
to vanish in managerial decisions. The experimental evidence indicates that the certainty effect is not eliminated
when probabilities are vague or ambiguous, as they are
in most real-life situations, and the effect may even be
enhanced (Curley et al. 1986, Hogarth and Einhorn
1990). We suspect that the effect may become even
stronger when a choice becomes a subject of debate, as
is commonly the case in managerial decisions: the rhetoric of prudent decision making favors the certainty effect, because an argument that rests on mere probability
is always open to doubt.
Perhaps the most important cause of risk aversion is
loss aversion, the discrepancy between the weights that
are attached to losses and to gains in evaluating prospects. Loss aversion is not mitigated when decisions are
made in an organizational context. On the contrary, the
asymmetry between credit and blame may enhance the

22

asymmetry between gains and losses in the decision
maker's utilities. The evidence indicates that the pressures of accountability and personal responsibility increase the status quo bias and other manifestations of
loss aversion. Decision makers become more risk averse
when they expect their choices to be reviewed by others
(Tetlock and Boettger 1991) and they are extremely reluctant to accept responsibility for even a small increase
in the probability of a disaster (Viscusi et al. 1987).
Swalm (1966) noted that managers appear to have an
excessive aversion to any outcome that could yield a
net loss, citing the example of a manager in a firm described as "an industrial giant", who would decline to
pursue a project that has a 50-50 chance of either making for his company a gain of $300,000 or losing
$60,000. Swalm hypothesized that the steep slopes of
utility functions in the domain of losses may be due to
control procedures that bias managers against choices
that might lead to losses. This interpretation seems appropriate since "several respondents stated quite clearly
that they were aware that their choices were not in the
best interests of the company, but that they felt them
to be in their own best interests as aspiring executives."
We conclude that the forces that produce risk aversion
in experimental studies of individual choice may be even
stronger in the managerial context. Note, however, that
we do not claim that an objective observer would describe managerial decisions as generally risk averse. The
second part of this essay will argue that decisions are
often based on optimistic assessments of the chances
of success, and are therefore objectively riskier than the
decision makers perceive them to be. Our hypotheses
about risk in managerial decisions are: (i) in a generally
favorable context, the threshold for accepting risk will
be high, and acceptable options will be subjectively perceived as carrying low risk, (ii) for problems viewed in
isolation the willingness to take risks is likely to be approximately constant for decisions that vary greatly in
size, and (iii) decisions will be narrowly framed even
when they could be viewed as instances of a category
of similar decisions. As a consequence, we predict (iv)
an imbalance in the risks that the organization accepts
in large and in small problems, such that relative risk
aversion is lower for the aggregate of small decisions
than for the aggregate of large decisions. These hypotheses are restricted to essentially favorable situations,

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOL 39, No. 1, January 1993

<-----Page 7----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

which often yield risk aversion in laboratory studies.
We specifically exclude situations in which risk seeking
is common, such as choices between essentially negative
options, or choices that involve small chances of large
gain.
Narrow Framing. We have suggested that people
tend to make decisions one at a time, and in particular
that they are prone to neglect the relevance of future
decision opportunities. For both individuals and organizations, the adoption of a broader frame and of a
consistent risk policy depends on two conditions: (i) an
ability to group together problems that are superficially
different; (ii) an appropriate procedure for evaluating
outcomes and the quality of performance.
A consistent risk policy can only be maintained if the
recurrent problems to which the policy applies are recognized as such. This is sometimes easy: competent organizations will identify obvious recurring questionsfor example, whether or not to purchase insurance for
a company vehicle-and will adopt policies for such
questions. The task is more complex when each decision
problem has many unique features, as might be the
case for acquisitions or new product development. The
explicit adoption of a broad frame will then require the
use of an abstractlanguage that highlights the important
common dimensions of diverse decision problems. Formal decision analysis provides such a language, in which
outcomes are expressed in money and uncertainty is
quantified as probability. Other abstractlanguages could
be used for the same purpose. As practitioners of decision analysis well know, however, the use of an abstract language conflicts with a natural tendency to describe each problem in its own terms. Abstraction necessarily involves a loss of subtlety and specificity, and
the summary descriptions that permit projects to be
compared almost always appear superficial and inadequate.
From the point of the individual executive who faces
a succession of decisions, the maintenance of a broad
decision frame also depends on how her performance
will be evaluated, and on the frequency of performance
reviews. For a schematic illustration, assume that reviews occur at predictable points in the sequence of
decisions and outcomes, and that the executive's outcomes are determined by the value of the firm's outcomes since the last review. Suppose the evaluation

SCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993
MANAGEMENT

function is identical to the utility function introduced
in the preceding numerical examples: the credit for
gaining 2.5 units and the blame for losing 1 unit just
cancel out. With this utility function, a single gamble
that offers equal probabilities to win 2 units or to lose
1 unit will not be acceptable if performance is evaluated
on that gamble by itself. The decision will not change
even if the manager knows that there will be a second
opportunity to play the same gamble. However, if the
evaluation of outcomes and the assignment of credit
and blame can be deferred until the gamble has been
played twice, the probability that the review will be
negative drops from 0.50 to 0.25 and the compound
gamble will be accepted. As this example illustrates,
reducing the frequency of evaluations can mitigate the
inhibiting effects of loss aversion on risk taking, as well
as other manifestations of myopic discounting.
The attitude that "you win a few and you lose a few"
could be recommended as an antidote to narrow framing, because it suggests that the outcomes of a set of
separable decisions should be aggregated before evaluation. However, the implied tolerance for "losing a
few" may conflict with other managerial imperatives,
including the setting of high standards and the maintenance of tight supervision. By the same token, of course,
narrow framing and excessive risk aversion may be unintended consequences of excessive insistence on measurable short-term successes. A plausible hypothesis is
that the adoption of a broad frame of evaluation is most
natural when the expected rate of success is low for
each attempt, as in drilling for oil or in pharmaceutical
development.6 The procedures of performance evaluation that have evolved in these industries could provide
a useful model for other attempts to maintain consistent
risk policies.
Near Proportionality of Risk Attitudes. Many executives in a hierarchical organization have two distinct
decision tasks: they make risky choices on behalf of the
organization, and they supervise several subordinates
who also make decisions. For analytical purposes, the
options chosen by subordinates can be treated as independent (or imperfectly correlated) gambles, which
usually involve smaller stakes than the decisions made
personally by the superior. A problem of risk aggre6

23

Choices and Forecasts

gation inevitably arises, and we conjecture that solving
it efficiently may be quite difficult.
To begin, ignore the supervisory function and assume
that all decisions are made independently, with narrow
framing. If all decision makers apply the same nearlyproportional risk attitudes (as suggested by Swalm
1966), an unbalanced set of choices will be made: The
aggregate of the subordinates' decisions will be more
risk averse than the supervisor's own decisions on larger
problems-which in turn are more risk averse than her
global utility for the portfolio, rationally evaluated. As
we saw in an earlier section, the costs of such inconsistencies in risk attitudes can be quite high.
Clearly, one of the goals of the executive should be
to avoid the potential inefficiency, by applying a consistent policy to risky choices and to those she supervises-and the consistent policy is not one of proportional risk aversion. As was seen earlier, a rational executive who considers a portfolio consisting of one large
gamble (which she chose herself) and ten smaller gambles (presumably chosen by subordinates) should be
considerably more risk averse in valuing the large gamble than in valuing any one of the smaller gambles. The
counter-intuitive implication of this analysis is that, in
a generally favorable context, an executive should encourage subordinates to adopt a higher level of riskacceptance than the level with which she feels comfortable. This is necessary to overcome the costly effects
of the (probable) insensitivity of her intuitive preferences to recurrence and aggregation. We suspect that
many executives will resist this recommendation, which
contradicts the common belief that accepting risks is
both the duty and the prerogative of higher management.
For several reasons, narrow framing and near-proportionality could be difficult to avoid in a hierarchical
organization. First, many decisions are both unique and
large at the level at which they are initially made. The
usual aversion to risk is likely to prevail in such decisions, even if from the point of view of the firm they
could be categorized as recurrent and moderately small.
Second, it appears unfair for a supervisor to urge acceptance of a risk that a subordinate is inclined to reject-especially because the consequences of failure are
likely to be more severe for the subordinate.
In summary, we have drawn on three psychological

24

principles to derive the prediction that the risk attitudes
that govern decisions of different sizes may not be coherent. The analysis suggests that there may be too
much aversion to risk in problems of small or moderate
size. However, the conclusion that greater risk taking
should be encouraged could be premature at this point,
because of the suspicion that agents' view of prospects
may be systematically biased in an optimistic direction.
The combination of a risk-neutral attitude and an optimistic bias could be worse than the combination of
unreasonable risk aversion and unjustified optimism.
As the next sections show, there is good reason to believe that such a dilemma indeed exists.

Bold Forecasts
Our review of research on individual risk attitudes suggests that the substantial degree of risk to which individuals and organizations willingly expose themselves
is unlikely to reflect true acceptance of these risks. The
alternative is that people and organizations often expose
themselves to risk because they misjudge the odds. We
next consider some of the mechanisms that produce the
'bold forecasts' that enable cautious decision makers to
take large risks.
Inside and Outside Views
We introduce this discussion by a true story, which illustrates an important cognitive quirk that tends to produce extreme optimism in planning.
In 1976 one of us (Daniel Kahneman) was involved in a
project designed to develop a curriculum for the study of judgment and decision making under uncertainty for high schools
in Israel. The project was conducted by a small team of academics and teachers. When the team had been in operation
for about a year, with some significant achievements already
to its credit, the discussion at one of the team meetings turned
to the question of how long the project would take. To make
the debate more useful, I asked everyone to indicate on a slip
of paper their best estimate of the number of months that
would be needed to bring the project to a well-defined stage
of completion: a complete draft ready for submission to the
Ministry of Education. The estimates, including my own, ranged
from 18 to 30 months. At this point I had the idea of turning
to one of our members, a distinguished expert in curriculum
development, asking him a question phrased about as follows:
"We are surely not the only team to have tried to develop a
curriculum where none existed before. Please try to recall as
many such cases as you can. Think of them as they were in a

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993

<-----Page 9----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

stage comparable to ours at present. How long did it take them,
from that point, to complete their projects?"After a long silence,
something much like the following answer was given, with
obvious signs of discomfort: "First, I should say that not all
teams that I can think of in a comparable stage ever did complete their task. About 40% of them eventually gave up. Of
the remaining, I cannot think of any that was completed in
less than seven years, nor of any that took more than ten". In
response to a further question, he answered: "No, I cannot
think of any relevant factor that distinguishes us favorably
from the teams I have been thinking about. Indeed, my
impression is that we are slightly below average in terms of
our resources and potential".

This story illustrates several of the themes that will
be developed in this section.
Two distinct modes of forecasting were applied to the
same problem in this incident. The inside view of the
problem is the one that all participants in the meeting
spontaneously adopted. An inside view forecast is generated by focusing on the case at hand, by considering
the plan and the obstacles to its completion, by constructing scenarios of future progress, and by extrapolating current trends. The outside view is the one that
the curriculum expert was encouraged to adopt. It essentially ignores the details of the case at hand, and
involves no attempt at detailed forecasting of the future
history of the project. Instead, it focuses on the statistics
of a class of cases chosen to be similar in relevant respects to the present one. The case at hand is also compared to other members of the class, in an attempt to
assess its position in the distribution of outcomes for
the class (Kahneman and Tversky 1979b). The distinction between inside and outside views in forecasting is
closely related to the distinction drawn earlier between
narrow and broad framing of decision problems. The
critical question in both contexts is whether a particular
problem of forecast or decision is treated as unique, or
as an instance of an ensemble of similar problems.
The application of the outside view was particularly
simple in this example, because the relevant class for
the problem was easy to find and to define. Other cases
are more ambiguous. What class should be considered,
for example, when a firm considers the probable costs
of an investment in a new technology in an unfamiliar
domain? Is it the class of ventures in new technologies
in the recent history of this firm, or the class of developments most similar to the proposed one, carried out

MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993

in other firms? Neither is perfect, and the recommendation would be to try both (Kahneman and Tversky
1979b). It may also be necessary to choose units of
measurement that permit comparisons. The ratio of actual spending to planned expenditure is an example of
a convenient unit that permits meaningful comparisons
across diverse projects.
The inside and outside views draw on different
sources of information, and apply different rules to its
use. An inside view forecast draws on knowledge of
the specifics of the case, the details of the plan that
exists, some ideas about likely obstacles and how they
might be overcome. In an extreme form, the inside view
involves an attempt to sketch a representative scenario
that captures the essential elements of the history of
the future. In contrast, the outside view is essentially
statistical and comparative, and involves no attempt to
divine future history at any level of detail.
It should be obvious that when both methods are
applied with equal intelligence and skill, the outside
view is much more likely to yield a realistic estimate.
In general, the future of a long and complex undertaking
is simply not foreseeable in detail. The ensemble of
possible future histories cannot be defined. Even if this
could be done, the ensemble would in most cases be
huge, and the probability of any particular scenario
negligible.7 Although some scenarios are more likely or
plausible than others, it is a serious error to assume that
the outcomes of the most likely scenarios are also the
most likely, and that outcomes for which no plausible
scenarios come to mind are impossible. In particular,
the scenario of flawless execution of the current plan
may be much more probable a priori than any scenario
for a specific sequence of events that would cause the
project to take four times longer than planned. Nevertheless, the less favorable outcome could be more
likely overall, because there are so many different ways
for things to go wrong. The main advantage of the outside approach to forecasting is that it avoids the snares
of scenario thinking (Dawes 1988). The outside view
provides some protection against forecasts that are not
7For the purposes of this exposition we assume that probabilities exist
as a fact about the world. Readers who find this position shocking
should transpose the formulation to a more complex one, according
to their philosophical taste.

25

<-----Page 10----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

even in the ballpark of reasonable possibilities. It is a
conservative approach, which will fail to predict extreme
and exceptional events, but will do well with common
ones. Furthermore, giving up the attempt to predict extraordinary events is not a great sacrifice when uncertainty is high, because the only way to score 'hits' on
such events is to predict large numbers of other extraordinary events that do not materialize.
This discussion of the statistical merits of the outside
view sets the stage for our main observation, which is
psychological: the inside view is overwhelmingly preferred in intuitive forecasting. The natural way to think
about a problem is to bring to bear all one knows about
it, with special attention to its unique features. The intellectual detour into the statistics of related cases is
seldom chosen spontaneously. Indeed, the relevance of
the outside view is sometimes explicitly denied: physicians and lawyers often argue against the application
of statistical reasoning to particular cases. In these instances, the preference for the inside view almost bears
a moral character. The inside view is valued as a serious
attempt to come to grips with the complexities of the
unique case at hand, and the outside view is rejected
for relying on crude analogy from superficially similar
instances. This attitude can be costly in the coin of predictive accuracy.
Three other features of the curriculum story should
be mentioned. First, the example illustrates the general
rule that consensus on a forecast is not necessarily an
indication of its validity: a shared deficiency of reasoning
will also yield consensus. Second, we note that the initial
intuitive assessment of our curriculumexpert was similar
to that of other members of the team. This illustrates a
more general observation: statistical knowledge that is
known to the forecaster will not necessarily be used, or
indeed retrieved, when a forecast is made by the inside
approach. The literature on the impact of the base rates
of outcomes on intuitive predictions supports this conclusion. Many studies have dealt with the task of predicting the profession or the training of an individual
on the basis of some personal information and relevant
statistical knowledge. For example, most people have
some knowledge of the relative sizes of different departments, and could use that knowledge in guessing
the field of a student seen at a graduating ceremony.
The experimental evidence indicates that base-rate in-

26

formation that is explicitly mentioned in the problem
has some effect on predictions, though usually not as
much as it should have (Griffin and Tversky 1992,
Lynch and Ofir 1989: for an alternative view see Gigerenzer et al. 1988). When only personal information
is explicitly offered, relevant statistical information that
is known to the respondent is largely ignored (Kahneman and Tversky 1973, Tversky and Kahneman 1983).
The sequel to the story illustrates a third general observation: facing the facts can be intolerably demoralizing. The participants in the meeting had professional
expertise in the logic of forecasting, and none even ventured to question the relevance of the forecast implied
by our expert's statistics: an even chance of failure, and
a completion time of seven to ten years in case of success. Neither of these outcomes was an acceptable basis
for continuing the project, but no one was willing to
draw the embarrassing conclusion that it should be
scrapped. So, the forecast was quietly dropped from
active debate, along with any pretense of long-term
planning, and the project went on along its predictably
unforeseeable path to eventual completion some eight
years later.
The contrast between the inside and outside views
has been confirmed in systematic research. One relevant
set of studies was concerned with the phenomenon of
overconfidence. There is massive evidence for the conclusion that people are generally overconfident in their
assignments of probability to their beliefs. Overconfidence is measured by recording the proportion of cases
in which statements to which an individual assigned a
probability p were actually true. In many studies this
proportion has been found to be far lower than p (see
Lichtenstein et al. 1982; for a more recent discussion
and some instructive exceptions see Griffin and Tversky
1992). Overconfidence is often assessed by presenting
general information questions in a multiple-choice format, where the participant chooses the most likely answer and assigns a probability to it. A typical result is
that respondents are only correct on about 80% of cases
when they describe themselves as "99% sure." People
are overconfident in evaluating the accuracy of their
beliefs one at a time. It is interesting, however, that
there is no evidence of overconfidence bias when respondents are asked after the session to estimate the
number of questions for which they picked the correct

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOL39, No. 1, January 1993

<-----Page 11----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

answer. These global estimates are accurate, or somewhat pessimistic (Gigerenzer et al. 1991, Griffin and
Tversky 1992). It is evident that people's assessments
of their overall accuracy does not control their confidence in particular beliefs. Academics are familiar with
a related example: finishing our papers almost always
takes us longer than we expected. We all know this and
often say so. Why then do we continue to make the
same error? Here again, the outside view does not inform judgments of particular cases.
In a compelling example of the contrast between inside and outside views, Cooper et al. (1988) interviewed
new entrepreneurs about their chances of success, and
also elicited from them estimates of the base rate of
success for enterprises of the same kind. Self-assessed
chances of success were uncorrelated to objective predictors of success such as college education, prior supervisory experience and initial capital. They were also
wildly off the mark on average. Over 80% of entrepreneurs perceived their chances of success as 70% or better. Fully one-third of them described their success as
certain. On the other hand, the mean chance of success
that these entrepreneurs attributed to a business like
theirs was 59%. Even this estimate is optimistic, though
it is closer to the truth: the five-year survival rate for
new firms is around 33% (Dun and Bradstreet 1967).
The inside view does not invariably yield optimistic
forecasts. Many parents of rebellious teenagers cannot
imagine how their offspring would ever become a reasonable adult, and are consequently more worried than
they should be, since they also know that almost all
teenagers do eventually grow up. The general point is
that the inside view is susceptible to the fallacies of
scenario thinking and to anchoring of estimates on
present values or on extrapolations of current trends.
The inside view burdens the worried parents with statistically unjustified premonitions of doom. To decision
makers with a goal and a plan, the same way of thinking
offers absurdly optimistic forecasts.
The cognitive mechanism we have discussed is not
the only source of optimistic errors.Unrealistic optimism
also has deep motivational roots (Tiger 1979). A recent
literature review (Taylor and Brown 1988) listed three
main forms of a pervasive optimistic bias: (i) unrealistically positive self-evaluations, (ii) unrealistic optimism about future events and plans, and (iii) an illusion

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/Vol. 39, No. 1, January 1993

of control. Thus, for almost every positive trait-including safe driving, a sense of humor, and managerial
risk taking (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986)-there
is a large majority of individuals who believe themselves
to be above the median. People also exaggerate their
control over events, and the importance of the skills
and resources they possess in ensuring desirable outcomes. Most of us underestimate the likelihood of hazards affecting us personally, and entertain the unlikely
belief that Taylor and Brown summarize as "The future
will be great, especially for me."

Organizational Optimism
There is no reason to believe that entrepreneurs and
executives are immune to optimistic bias. The prevalence
of delusions of control among managers has been recognized by many authors (among others, Duhaime and
Schwenk 1985, March and Shapira 1987, Salancik and
Meindl 1984). As we noted earlier, managers commonly
view risk as a challenge to be overcome, and believe
that risk can be modified by "managerial wisdom and
skill" (Donaldson and Lorsch 1983). The common refusal of managers to refuse risk estimates provided to
them as "given" (Shapira 1986) is a clear illustration
of illusion of control.
Do organizations provide effective controls against
the optimistic bias of individual executives? Are organizational decisions founded on impartial and unbiased
forecasts of consequences? In answering these questions,
we must again distinguish problems that are treated as
recurrent, such as forecasts of the sales of existing product lines, from others that are considered unique. We
have no reason to doubt the ability of organizations to
impose forecasting discipline and to reduce or eliminate
obvious biases in recurrent problems. As in the case of
risk, however, all significant forecasting problems have
features that make them appear unique. It is in these
unique problems that biases of judgment and choice are
most likely to have their effects, for organizations as
well as for individuals. We next discuss some likely
causes of optimistic bias in organizational judgments,
some observations of this bias, and the costs and benefits
of unrealistic optimism.
Causes. Forecasts often develop as part of a case
that is made by an individual or group that already has,
or is developing a vested interest in the plan, in a context

27

<-----Page 12----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

of competition for the control of organizational resources. The debate is often adversarial. The only projects that have a good chance of surviving in this competition are those for which highly favorable outcomes
are forecast, and this produces a powerful incentive for
would-be promoters to present optimistic numbers. The
statistical logic that produces the winner's curse in other
contexts (Capen, Clapp and Campbell 1971; Bazerman
and Samuelson 1983; Kagel and Levin 1986) applies
here as well: the winning project is more likely than
others to be associated with optimistic errors (Harrison
and March 1984). This is an effect of regression to the
mean. Thus, the student who did best in an initial test
is also the one for whom the most regression is expected
on a subsequent test. Similarly, the projects that are
forecast to have the highest returns are the ones most
likely to fall short of expectations.
Officially adopted forecasts are also likely to be biased
by their secondary functions as demands, commands
and commitments (Lowe and Shaw 1968, Lawler and
Rhode 1976, Lawler 1986, Larkey and Smith 1984). A
forecast readily becomes a target, which induces loss
aversion for performance that does not match expectations, and can also induce satisficing indolence when
the target is exceeded. The obvious advantages of setting
high goals is an incentive for higher management to
adopt and disseminate optimistic assessments of future
accomplishments-and possibly to deceive themselves
in the process.
In his analysis of "groupthink," Janis (1982) identified
other factors that favor organizational optimism. Pessimism about what the organization can do is readily
interpreted as disloyalty, and consistent bearers of bad
news tend to be shunned. Bad news can be demoralizing. When pessimistic opinions are suppressed in this
manner, exchanges of views will fail to perform a critical
function. The optimistic biases of individual group
members can become mutually reinforcing, as unrealistic views are validated by group approval.
The conclusion of this sketchy analysis is that there
is little reason to believe organizations will avoid the
optimistic bias-except perhaps when the problems are
considered recurrent and subjected to statistical quality
control. On the contrary, there are reasons to suspect
that many significant decisions made in organizations
are guided by unrealistic forecasts of their consequences.

The optimistic bias of capital inObservations.
is
vestment projects a familiar fact of life: the typical
project finishes late, comes in over budget when it is
finally completed, and fails to achieve its initial goals.
Grossly optimistic errors appear to be especially likely
if the project involves new technology or otherwise
places the firm in unfamiliar territory. A Rand Corporation study on pioneer process plants in the energy
field demonstrates the magnitude of the problem (Merrow et al. 1981). Almost all project construction costs
exceeded initial estimates by over 20%. The norm was
for actual construction costs to more than double first
estimates. These conclusions are corroborated by PIMS
data on start-up ventures in a wide range of industries
(cited by Davis 1985). More than 80% of the projects
studied fell short of planned market share.
In an interesting discussion of the causes of failure
in capital investment projects, Arnold (1986) states:
Most companies support large capital expenditure programs
with a worst case analysis that examines the projects' loss potential. But the worst case forecast is almost always too optimistic.. .. When managers look at the downside they generally describe a mildly pessimistic future rather than the worst
possible future.

As an antidote against rosy predictions Arnold recommends staying power analysis, a method used by
lenders to determine if organizations under severe strain
can make payments. In effect, the advice is for managers
to adopt an outside view of their own problem.
Mergers and acquisitions provide another illustration
of optimism and of illusions of control. On average,
bidding firms do not make a significantly positive return.
This striking observation raises the question of why so
many takeovers and mergers are initiated. Roll (1986)
offers a "hubris hypothesis" to explain why decision
makers acquiring firms tend to pay too much for their
targets. Roll cites optimistic estimates of "economies due
to synergy and (any) assessments of weak management" as the primary causes of managerial hubris. The
bidding firms are prone to overestimate the control they
will have over the merged organization, and to underestimate the "weak" managers who are currently in
charge.
Costs and Benefits. Optimism and the illusion of
control increase risk taking in several ways. In a discussion of the Challenger disaster, Landau and Chis-

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOL 39, No. 1, January 1993

<-----Page 13----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

holm (1990) introduced a "law of increasing optimism"
as a form of Russian roulette. Drawing on the same
case, Starbuck and Milliken (1988) noted how quickly
vigilance dissipates with repeated successes. Optimism
in a competitive context may take the form of contempt
for the capabilities of opponents (Roll 1986). In a bargaining situation, it will support a hard line that raises
the risk of conflict. Neale and Bazerman (1983) observed a related effect in a final-offer arbitration setup,
where the arbiter is constrained to choose between the
final offers made by the contestants. The participants
were asked to state their subjective probability that the
final offer they presented would be preferred by the
arbiter. The average of these probabilities was approximately 0.70; with a less sanguine view of the strength
of their case the contestants would surely have made
more concessions. In the context of capital investment
decisions, optimism and the illusion of control manifest
themselves in unrealistic forecasts and unrealizable
plans (Arnold 1986).
Given the high cost of mistakes, it might appear obvious that a rational organization should want to base
its decisions on unbiased odds, rather than on predictions painted in shades of rose. However, realism has
its costs. In their review of the consequences of optimism
and pessimism, Taylor and Brown (1988) reached the
deeply disturbing conclusion that optimistic self-delusion is both a diagnostic indication of mental health and
well-being, and a positive causal factor that contributes
to successful coping with the challenges of life. The
benefits of unrealistic optimism in increasing persistence
in the face of difficulty have been documented by other
investigators (Seligman 1991).
The observation that realism can be pathological and
self-defeating raises troubling questions for the management of information and risk in organizations.
Surely, no one would want to be governed entirely by
wishful fantasies, but is there a point at which truth
becomes destructive and doubt self-fulfilling? Should
executives allow or even encourage unrealistic optimism
among their subordinates? Should they willingly allow
themselves to be caught up in productive enthusiasm,
and to ignore discouraging portents? Should there be
someone in the organization whose function it is to
achieve forecasts free of optimistic bias, although such
forecasts, if disseminated, would be demoralizing?

MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE/VOL 39, No. 1, January 1993

Should the organization maintain two sets of forecasting
books (as some do, see Bromiley 1986)? Some authors
in the field of strategy have questioned the value of
realism, at least implicitly. Weick's famous story of the
lost platoon that finds its way in the Alps by consulting
a map of the Pyrenees indicates more respect for confidence and morale than for realistic appraisal. On the
other hand, Landau and Chisholm (1990) pour withering scorn on the "arrogance of optimism" in organizations, and recommend a pessimistic failure-avoiding
management strategy to control risk. Before further
progress can be made on this difficult issue, it is important to recognize the existence of a genuine dilemma
that will not yield to any simple rule

Concluding Remarks
Our analysis has suggested that many failures originate
in the highly optimistic judgments of risks and opportunities that we label bold forecasts. In the words of
March and Shapira (1987), "managers accept risks, in
part, because they do not expect that they will have to
bear them." March and Shapira emphasized the role of
illusions of control in this bias. We have focused on
another mechanism-the adoption of an inside view of
problems, which leads to anchoring on plans and on
the most available scenarios. We suggest that errors of
intuitive prediction can sometimes be reduced by
adopting an outside view, which forecasts the outcome
without attempting to forecast its history (Kahneman
and Tversky 1979b). This analysis identifies the strong
intuitive preference for the inside view as a source of
difficulties that are both grave and avoidable.
On the issue of risk we presented evidence that decision makers tend to deal with choices one at a time,
and that their attitudes to risk exhibit risk-aversion and
near-proportionality. The reluctance to take explicit responsibility for possible losses is powerful, and can be
very costly in the aggregate (for a discussion of its social
costs see Wildavsky 1988). We claimed further that
when the stakes are small or moderate relative to assets
the aversion to risk is incoherent and substantively unjustified. Here again, the preference for treating decision
problems as unique causes errors that could be avoided
by a broader view.
Our analysis implies that the adoption of an outside
view, in which the problem at hand is treated as an

29

<-----Page 14----->KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts

instance of a broader category, will generally reduce the
optimistic bias and may facilitate the application of a
consistent risk policy. This happens as a matter of course
in problems of forecasting or decision that the organization recognizes as obviously recurrent or repetitive.
However, we have suggested that people are strongly
biased in favor of the inside view, and that they will
normally treat significant decision problems as unique
even when information that could support an outside
view is available. The adoption of an outside view in
such cases violates strong intuitions about the relevance
of information. Indeed, the deliberate neglect of the
features that make the current problem unique can appear irresponsible. A deliberate effort will therefore be
required to foster the optimal use of outside and inside
views in forecasting, and the maintenance of globally
consistent risk attitudes in distributed decision systems.
Bold forecasts and timid attitudes to risk tend to have
opposite effects. It would be fortunate if they canceled
out precisely to yield optimal behavior in every situation,
but there is little reason to expect such a perfect outcome.
The conjunction of biases is less disastrous than either
one would have been on its own, but there ought to be
a better way to control choice under risk than pitting
two mistakes against each other. The prescriptive implications of the relation between the biases in forecast
and in risk taking is that corrective attempts should deal
with these biases simultaneously. Increasing risk taking
could easily go too far in the presence of optimistic forecasts, and a successful effort to improve the realism of
assessments could do more harm than good in an organization that relies on unfounded optimism to ward
off paralysis.8
