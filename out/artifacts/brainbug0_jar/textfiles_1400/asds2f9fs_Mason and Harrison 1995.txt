<-----Page 0----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap:
The Role of Informal Venture Capital

ABSTRACT. There is evidence from a number of countries
that small firms encounter a shortage of long-term investment
finance, particularly at start-up and initial growth. Expea~sion
of the institutional venture capital industry has done little to
fill this "equity gap" on account of its preference for making
large investments in established companies and managementJleveraged buyouts. Moreover, the supply of venture
capital exhibits a high level of spatial concentration. Initiatives
by state/provincial and local governments, most notably in
economically lagging regions, to increase the supply of risk
capital for start-ups and early stage businesses have at best
provided a very partial, and often costly, solution. A more
appropriate approach to increasing the supply of start-up and
early stage finance is to facilitate the more efficient operation of the informal venture capital market. Informal investors,
or "business angels", are private investors who provide risk
capital directly to new and growing businesses in which they
have no family connection. Most business angels are unable
to find sufficient investment opportunities and so have substantial uncommitted funds available. There is also considerable scope for expanding the population of business angels.
The most cost-effective means of closing the equity gap
is therefore for the public sector to underwrite the operating
costs of business introduction services whose objective is to
overcome the two main sources of inefficiency in the informal
venture capital market, namely the invisibility of business
angels and the high search costs of angels seeking investment
opportunities and entrepreneurs seeking investors, by the provision of a channel of communication between informal
investors and entrepreneurs seeking finance.

Introduction

Various studies show that the availability and
cost of finance, especially long-term investment
capital, is one of the most important constraints
on the formation and development of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Oakey, 1984;
Monck et at., 1988; Binks et al., 1992; CBI, t993;
EVCA, 1993a). Obtaining finance is particularly
difficult for new and recently established firms,
fast-growing businesses and technology-based
businesses. Access to public stock markets is
precluded to the vast majority of smaller businesses because of the high fixed costs involved
(Buckland and Davis, 1989) while reliance on debt
finance leads to dangers of undercapitalisation,
which is the most frequent cause of business
failure (Binks and Vale, 1992).
The expansion of venture capital activity in
most developed countries during the past 10 to 15
years has provided a new source of long-term
investment capital which has contributed to the
closing of this equity gap. Venture capital cm-~be
defined as an activity by which corporate investors
provide long-term equity finance, supported by
business skills, to unquoted companies with the
potential to grow rapidly with the aim of making
an evenvaat capital gain commensurate with the
high risk and illiquidity involved in the investment
rather than interest income or dividend yield. The
venture capital industry is therefore characterised
by a high rejection rate as very few businesses can
demonstrate that they have the potential to provide
annualised rates of return of 30 to 60 per cent
which are typically sought. Venture capitalists
devote considerable effort to evaluating potential
investments and undertaking all possible 'due

<-----Page 1----->154

diligence' in order to filter out poor investments.
Venture capital activity is also a "hands-on"
activity: the venture capitalist will typically have
an active involvement in the management of the
business receiving the finance, both to contain
potential down-side exposure and also to "add
value" to the investment. Finally, venture capital
investments require an identifiable exit route to
enable the venture capitalist to realise their investment (Lorenz, 1989; Mason and Harrison, 1991;
Murray, 1991 a).
Venture capital activity originated in the USA
immediately after World War Two but expanded
enormously during the 1980s as a result of
changes in tax and securities legislation. In 1979
there were about 225 venture capital firms which
invested $460 million in 375 companies. At its
peak in 1987 over 700 venture capital firms
invested $3.94 billion in over 1700 companies. By
the end of the decade this level of activity had
fallen back a little with over $3 billion invested
in over 1300 companies (Bygrave and Timmons,
1992). A similar expansion in venture capital
activity occurred during the 1980s in a number of
other countries which had little or no prior experience of this form of financial activity. In Canada,
the venture capital industry expanded between
1980 and 1990 from 20 firms with a pool of $350
million to about 75 firms and a pool of $3.3bn
(MacDonald, 1991). In the UK prior to 1979
there were about 20 venture capital companies
with a total investment of £20 million. By 1992
there were well over 100 venture capital firms
which invested £1.25bn in 1147 companies (plus
a further £183m in 149 companies in other
countries) (BVCA, 1993). There has also been
an increase in venture capital activity in other
European countries (EVCA, 1993b). Indeed,
Europe has overtaken the USA in terms of venture
capital investments (EVCA, 1993a), with a total
of ECU 4.7 billion ($1 -- 1.13 ECU) invested in
6197 companies in 1992 (EVCA, 1993b)

Venture capital and the equity gap
The venture capital industry has had a catalytic
role in the entrepreneurial process by identifying,
financially supporting and nurturing growthminded businesses with entrepreneurial talent to
start-up and grow. The evidence for this is most

clear cut in the USA. Bygrave and Timmons
(1992) note that venture capital-backed companies
have added value through technological and
market innovations, while their economic contributions have included significant job creation, new
R&D expenditures, export sales and payment of
taxes. World class technology companies such as
Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple Computer,
Sun Microsystems, Lotus, Compaq and Prime
Computer as well as market innovators such as
Federal Express and Staples Inc were backed by
venture capitalists at their start-up. In Europe
too, venture-capital backed companies have, in
aggregate, experienced above average rates of
employment growth, with the EVCA describing
such companies as "engines for our economies"
(EVCA, 1993a, p. 4). At a sub-national level
an active local venture capital industry has played
a critical role in the development of "high-tech"
clusters such as Silicon Valley and Route 128
(Florida and Kenney, 1988a; Bygrave and
Timmons, 1992).
However, the venture capital industry is in a
process of change throughout the developed
world. The industry has contracted in recent years
in terms of the amounts of finance raised and
invested, the investment focus of the industry has
shifted and there are marked spatial variations in
the availability of venture capital. These developments have raised the concern that developed
economies "'may be losing the unique company
building skills that have been so vital to the entrepreneurial process" (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992,
p. 66). Moreover, this has occurred during a period
of recession when the need for such skills is at
its greatest. We examine each of these issues in
turn.
Size o f the venture capital pool

The first aspect of concern is that the rapid growth
of venture capital activity came to a halt in the
late 1980s. Since then amounts raised and invested
have both fallen and there has been a shakeout in the number of venture capital firms. For
example, venture capital firms in the UK have
experienced difficulties in raising additional funds
since 1989 as a result of the increasing concern
of institutional investors about the future returns
from venture capital activity. Indeed, the longer

<-----Page 2----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

term availability of funds is the single most important concern of venture capitalists. The immediate
consequence has been greater competition for the
scarce supply of institutional funds. Most venture
capitalists believe that these conditions will result
in a shakeout, with poor performing and marginal
funds likely to exit the industry (Murray, 1991a;
1991b). Moreover, given the two or three year
time-lag between creating a new fund and making
investments, it is likely that this drop in new funds
will be reflected in a reduced value of annual
investments from the mid-1990s onwards (Murray,
1995). The UK experience is reflected elsewhere
in Europe: new funds raised by the European
venture capital industry peaked in 1989 at ECU
5.8m, falling to ECU 4.2m in 1992 (EVCA,
1993b). Similar trends are also apparent in the
USA where venture capital activity has declined
sharply since 1987 (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992).
There was a recovery in 1992, although activity
remains well below the peak levels of the 1980s.
In Canada a number of seasoned venture capital
firms with a proven track-record have also been
unable to raise new funds (Doyle, 1993).

Investment focus
Significant shifts in the investment focus of the
venture capital industry is the second issue for
concern. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the
emphasis of the venture capital industry was on
early stage and technology-based businesses.
However, the contemporary industry is now
dominated by later stage deals, and especially
management buyouts (MBOs)/leveraged buyouts
(LBOs)o In the UK the number of start-up and
early stage investments has fallen from the
400--500 range in 1988 and 1989 to 222 in 1992.
More significantly, start-ups and early stage
investments have fallen as a proportion of all
investments from around 30 per cent in the mid1980s to just 17 per cent in 1992 and from 20--30
per cent of the total amount invested to just 6 per
cent over the same period. Meanwhile, MBOs
have increased since the mid-1980s to account for
well over half of the total amount invested by
venture capital funds in recent years (65 per cent
of the total amount invested in 1992) (Pratt, 1990;
BVCA, 1993). Thus, the venture capital industry
is increasingly specialising in the provision of

155

replacement equity, whereby existing shareholders
are bought out and replaced by new shareholders,
while its role in the provision of new equity to
start-ups and early stage businesses has become
increasingly marginal (Murray, 1994).
These trends are a product of two factors.
On the one hand, they reflect the evaluation and
monitoring costs which must precede and accompany venture capital investments. These represent
a significant fixed cost element and so makes it
uneconomic for funds to make investments of less
than about £250,000 (indeed, Batchelor (1993)
suggests that initial accountancy and legal fees,
for example, are unlikely to be less than £50,000
to £70,000, irrespective of the size of the prospective investment). On the other hand, they reflect
the attractions of providing development capital to
larger, established businesses and investing in
management buyouts. Such investments involve
known businesses with a track-record and a
projected future, in usually well-understood, and
frequently mature, industry sectors, and the competence of the management teams can be judged
on the basis of their track-record (Murray, t 994).
As a consequence, they involve lower risks,
require less appraisal and monitoring, provide
more scope for high fee income and have a quicker
exit route than most other types of investment.
Most of the venture capitalists in Murray's t991
survey expected that MBOs would continue to
dominate UK venture capital activity during the
1990s (Murray, 1991a).
The sectoral focus of UK venture capital funds
has also shifted away from its initial emphasis on
technology-related investments. Since the mid1980s technology investments have become a
specialist activity undertaken by a small minority
of venture capitalists. Computer-related and electronic-related companies accounted for 30 per cent
of the finance invested in 1984 compared with just
4 per cent in 1992, with investments in medical
and biotechnology accounting for a further 3
per cent of finance invested. Investments by UK
venture capital funds are now concentrated in
consumer-related sectors (Pratt, 1990; BVCA,
1993). The reason for this shift is simply that
technology investments are perceived by most
venture capitalists as more risky than the available
later stage investment opportunities. As a result,
technology projects face a higher IRR threshold

<-----Page 3----->156

Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison

when compared with non-technology projects at
the same stage of financing and have to demonstrate a supra-national market potential (Murray
and Lott, 1992).
Similar shifts in the investment focus of venture
capital funds away from early stage deals and
technology-based sectors are also apparent in
continental Europe (EVCA, 1993b), Canada
(Government of Ontario, 1990; Standeven, 1993)
and the USA. In the USA the number of startup financings and the amount invested have
both fallen significantly since the early 1980s.
Proportionately, such investments have declined
from 43 per cent of all investments to just 10 per
cent between 1983 and 1989. Other early stage
investments have also declined, although not as
severely. Paralleling this trend has been an
increase in the number of deals and the amount
invested in expansion financings, LBOs and other
later stage deals. Bygrave and Timmons (1992)
attribute these developments to the displacement
of "classic" venture capital by "merchant capital"
funds. Classic venture capital is concerned with
early stage investments and involves skills that
add value in company forming, building and harvesting; merchant capital funds, on the other hand,
are almost entirely dependent upon institutional
investors, emphasise financial engineering knowhow, transaction crafting and closing and fee
generation, and are obsessed with short-term
gains. There has also been a shift in the sectoral
pattern of investments in favour of consumerrelated deals (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992),
although the US venture capital industry remains
more committed to technology-related sectors than
its European and Canadian counterparts.

Spatial focus
The third issue concerns spatial variations in the
availability of venture capital. Studies in various
countries highlight the very high degree of spatial
concentration of both venture capital firms and
investments in core regions and the lack of investments in peripheral, economically lagging regions.
In the UK, 63 per cent of venture capital companies are based in London (BVCA, 1992). This is
a result of historical and institutional forces.
London has long been the pre-eminent financial
centre in the UK, containing various financial and

related institutions and a diverse range of investment expertise and business consultancy services.
As the venture capital industry is a further specialist division of the finance industry it was
inevitable that it should be concentrated in
London. Most of the funds have either been established by banks and insurance companies located
in London or else are spin-offs, established by
finance-industry executives and located in London
for reasons connected with the pool of professional labour and existence of agglomeration
economies (Martin, 1989). The dominance of
London is even greater in terms of the proportion
of the total venture capital pool managed by funds
located in the city (Mason and Harrison, 1991;
Martin, 1992). However, there has been a modest
growth in the number of venture capital funds in
provincial cities, such as Manchester (Gibbs,
1991; Mason and Harrison, 1991), but from a very
small base. The South East has also consistently
attracted a disproportionate share of venture
capital investments, accounting for 45 per cent of
the total amount invested in 1992. Conversely,
with the exception of Scotland, all other regions
have attracted a lower share of venture capital
investments than "expected" on the basis of their
proportion of the national stock of businesses
(BVCA, 1993; Mason and Harrison, 1991; Martin,
1989; 1992).
Similar spatial patterns are apparent in other
countries. In Canada venture capital firms are concentrated in Toronto, the main financial centre,
and, to a lesser extent, in Montreal and Calgary
and investments clearly favour the Toronto region
(McNaughton and Green, 1989; McNaughton,
1991). In the USA venture capital firms are concentrated not just in financial centres but also in
centres of high technology industry. Silicon Valley,
California, the Route 128 area around Boston,
Massachusetts and New York City together
account for 70 per cent of the venture capital
supply. Less important though still significant concentrations of venture capital firms are located in
Chicago, Connecticut, Texas, Minneapolis and
Colorado. Investments are mainly concentrated in
California and Massachusetts which account for
over half of all investments (Florida and Kenney,
1988a; 1988b; Florida and Smith, 1990; 1993;
Florida et al., 1991).
Demand side factors play a major role in

<-----Page 4----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

accounting for this spatial pattern. Indeed, the
geography of venture capital investments closely
parallels the locational distribution of rapidgrowth firms (Mason, 1985; Wheeler, 1990).
Some commentators suggest that the lack of
demand for venture capital in peripheral regions
reflects the greater reluctance of firms in such
regions to seek equity finance (Gibbs, 1991).
Others suggest that demand for venture capital
is depressed by the dominance of lifestyle businesses in such regions (Economic Council of
Newfoundland and Labrador, 1988). It is also suggested that firms in peripheral regions lack information about financing alternatives and have
limited understanding of the role of equity and
how to raise it, a failing which reflects the limited
knowledge of banks, accountants and other professional intermediaries in such regions about
sources of venture capital and the factors which
venture capitalists take into account in assessing
investment proposals (Invest North West Working
Party, 1989).
However, there is also an independent supplyside influence on the location of venture capital
investments arising from the spatial organisation
of the venture capital industry and the perception of venture capitalists (Martin, 1989; 1992).
Venture capitalists rely on personalised, informal
and therefore localized information networks
with other venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, large
company contacts, consultants, technical experts
and a range of other actors to identify investment opportunities, organise deals and mobilize
resources. As a result, most investments are
made in companies located relatively close the
venture capitalist's office. Investing in businesses
located in fairly close spatial proximity also
enables venture capitalists to more easily monitor
their investments, thereby limiting risk (Florida
and Kenney, 1988b). Venture capitalists' perceptions arising from their mental maps of economic potential may also exert an influence on
their spatial search for investment opportunities
(Mason, t987). The effect of these explicitly
geographical factors is to constrain the spatial
behaviour of venture capitalists (Thompson,
1989).
The consequence is that unless a region has a
well-developed concentration of venture capital
funds of its own, then the further it is away from

157

the main centre, or centres, of venture capital
activity the more disadvantaged will be its local
entrepreneurs in terms of access to this type of
finance. In the UK context this means that "the
further a region is from London, the more important it is for that region to have its own circuit of
venture finance" (Martin, 1992, p. t65).
Summary
The consequence of these trends is that there
are now various "gaps" in the supply of venture
capital, Companies at the seed, start-up and early
stages of development and requiring external
financing encounter great difficulties in raising
equity f;mance from the venture capital industry.
This raises the concern that growth~potential
businesses, particularly those involved in technology-based activities, will be constrained by the
lack of appropriate sources of risk capital. Banks
are reluctant to lend to businesses with no assets,
and in any case the financing needs of such businesses are likely to be inappropriate for debt
finance (Binks et aI., 1992). Alternative financing
options (such as factoring) are typically only
open to more mature companies with an ability
to generate cash. This problem is particularly
acute in less developed regions which lack an
indigenous venture capital industry, mad threatens
the viability of regional economic development
policies which are increasingly based on the promotion of indigenous development via SMEs
rather than the attraction of mobile investment.
This is, for example, the main emphasis of
regional industrial policy in the UK (HM Government, 1988; Wren, 1990) and of the Atlantic
Canada Opportunities Agency (Savoie, 1992;
ACOA, 1992).
Mechanisms to close venture capital gaps

State/provincial and local governments, particularly in regions lacking an indigenous venture
capital industry, have responded to these concerns
with a variety of initiatives designed to stimulate
the supply of start-up and early stage finance° The
objectives of this paper are, first, to critically
review the impact of such initiatives as mechanisms for stimulating the supply of local sources
of venture capital for start-ups and early stage

<-----Page 5----->158

businesses and for technology-based firms and,
second, to suggest that the promotion of informal
venture capital - i.e. direct investments by private
individuals, or "business angels", in companies in
which they have no family connection - provides
a better basis for closing both national and
regional "equity gaps". In this section we provide
a brief review of "conventional" approaches
that have been adopted, drawing largely upon
examples of policy initiatives in the UK, USA and
Canada. We suggest that such initiatives have had
only a limited impact in closing these various
capital gaps. In the following sections we highlight the merits of informal venture capital and
propose ways in which the supply of informal
venture capital can be stimulated.
Strategies for increasing the regional supply of
equity capital can be classified into three broad
types.
Tax incentive schemes to stimulate private sector
venture capital funds

One approach, which is only possible in countries
where states/provinces have the power to raise
taxes, is the use of tax incentives to encourage
private sources of finance for investment in SMEs,
either directly or indirectly via pooled funds. This
approach has been widely used in Canada where
every province has a provincially-sponsored
venture capital company (PSVCC) scheme,
modelled on Ontario's Small Business Development Corporations (SBDCs). A PSVCC is a
pooled investment vehicle which raises money
from investors for investment in approved businesses. Most schemes provide investors in a
PSVCC - who can be private individuals or corporations - with either a cash grant or tax credit.
However, some schemes provide the PSVCC with
an equity loan on the basis of dollar-for-dollar
matching with the amount of equity invested by
its shareholders (Moncton Consulting Services,
1991).
Globerman and Olson (1986) suggest that such
schemes have had a favourable outcome in terms
of the amounts raised and invested, the additionality achieved and the emphasis on start-up and
early stage investments. An evaluation of PSVCCs
in Atlantic Canada also concluded that they are an
effective means of enabling small businesses to

raise venture capital. Indeed, PSVCCs are the
most important source of venture capital in the
region (Moncton Consulting Services, 1991;
ACOA 1992). However, this assessment went on
to conclude that "PSVCCs are no panacea"
(Moncton Consulting Services, 1991, p. 53). They
have often been single company investment
vehicles and have tended to make passive investments. There have also been difficulties in
successfully exiting from their investments which,
in turn, has hindered their ability to re-cycle their
funds. As a result, PSVCCs have often run out of
funds after making their initial round of investments. This lack of liquidity also appears to have
deterred some potential investors. PSVCCs have
also had a low propensity to provide follow-on
finance (Moncton Consulting Services, 1991;
ACOA, 1992). A further criticism is that although
PSVCCs were conceived to be market driven, with
governments adopting a hands-off approach, in
practice they have, in some instances, "fallen prey
to political and bureaucratic a g e n d a s . . , where
'public accountability' has sometimes introduced
other criteria." (ACOA, 1992, pp. 83-84).
Public sector venture capital funds

In many countries local and state/provincial governments have little or no powers of taxation to
influence the supply of venture capital. A much
more common approach is the establishment of
public sector venture capital funds using public
sources of finance to make direct investments in
companies. In the USA, Thompson and Bayer
(1992) have identified 28 public venture capital
funds in 20 states, predominantly in the Northeast
and Midwest. In the UK, seven public sector
venture capital funds (all of which are in Scotland
or Northern Ireland) are listed in the BVCA
Directory or in the Venture Capital Report Guide
to Venture Capital (Cary, 1993). There are a
further five funds which were originally created
by local authorities, but following the 1989 Local
Government and Housing Act which restricted
local authority involvement in various forms of
economic development initiatives, these funds
have been restructured to become independent
of local authorities by widening the number of
investors in these funds (Roberts and Miller,
1993). In Canada, venture capital is provided by

<-----Page 6----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

provincial Crown Corporations and agencies. In
Atlantic Canada such sources accounted for over
one-third of venture capital investments by value
between 1980 and 1990 (Moneton Consulting
Services, 1991; ACOA, 1992).
Public sector venture capital funds have a
number of significant shortcomings and deficiencies which limits their effectiveness in filling these
capital gaps. First, public sector venture capital
funds generally have limited resources. As a
result, their impact has often been modest.
Thompson and Bayer (t992) note that the aggregate activity level and average programme size of
public sector venture capital programmes in the
USA remain very small compared with the private
venture capital sector. Similarly, in the UK public
sector venture capital funds represent a very small
proportion of total venture capital activity; for
example, investments by public sector venture
capital funds account for only 2 per cent of the
total amount invested (at cost) by UK venture
capital firms. With the exception of the funds that
are operated by Scottish Enterprise (formerly the
Scottish Development Agency) and the Welsh
Development Agency (which represent the major
source of venture capital in their respective
regions), public sector venture capital funds are
small compared to private venture capital funds.
One of the implications may be the inability of
such funds to provide follow-on financing to their
investee businesses.
There must also be doubts about the ability of
the public sector to maintain even this modest contribution as a source of venture capital in the
future. Thompson and Bayer (1992) point to the
vulnerability of public sector venture capital funds
in the US to budget cuts because of their lack of
a political constituency and possible pressures for
privatisation, with the implication that this will
result in a shift away from the current focus of
most funds on small scale, early stage investments.
A similar concern is voiced by MacDonald (1991).
Referring to the Canadian situation she argues that
public sector venture capital funds are "clearly not
a tenable solution over the longer term since
government cannot sustain itself fiscally or politically as the primary source of equity capital
for young Canadian technology companies, nor
should it attempt to do so" (MacDonald, 1991,
p. 14).

159

Second, in many cases the investment focus of
public sector venture capital funds has not been to
fill the gaps left by private sector funds. Rather,
their investment focus and operation often makes
them indistinguishable from private sector venture
capital funds. This is particularly the case in the
UK where the privatisation of the former local
authority "enterprise boards" and government
pressure on Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh
Development Agency to operate their venture
capital funds on a broadly commercial basis have
exacerbated this feature. A detailed breakdown of
the investments of nine public sector venture
capital funds is provided by Cary (1993): seven of
these funds had made the majority of their investments in established companies seeking development finance and management buyouts (and so
their average investment size is towards the upper
end of the equity gap) and only two funds had
concentrated the majority of their investments in
start-ups and early stage businesses. Moreover, the
appraisal process of UK public sector venture
capital funds is no less rigorous than that of
private sector funds; indeed, they often review a
smaller proportion of the propositions they receive
tban private sector venture capital firms (Mason
and Harrison, 1991).
Third, public sector venture capital funds are
generally restricted to making investments in
the jurisdiction which has provided the finance.
However, placing geographical restrictions on the
investment activities of public sector venture
capital funds is likely to constrain the deal flow,
increasing the chance that poor quality investments are made, causing the fund to perform
poorly. However, if no geographical restrictions
are imposed then investment funds may flow to
areas with better investment opportunities, thereby
depleting local resources (Florida and Kenney,
1988a; Florida and Smith, 1990).
Fourth, providing finance is just a small part
of what venture capitalists do. The success of
investing is ultimately contingent upon the suppoA
services that venture capitalists can provide to
their investee businesses (Florida and Kenney,
1988a). New and recent start-ups in particular
require the active participation of venture capitalists. Murray (1991a) suggests that start-ups are
likely to require at least 200 hours of input from
a venture capitalist a year - more if the business

<-----Page 7----->160

Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison

is in difficulties. This limits the number of investments that a venture capitalist can handle to a
maximum of five or six. However, public sector
venture capital funds are likely to encounter
difficulties in recruiting sufficient staff with
entrepreneurial and investing experience, particularly if, as is likely, they are unable to match the
reward structure of private sector funds which
allows (in many cases, requires) venture capitalists to invest their own money alongside the
fund so that they can share in the success of the
investee businesses.
Fifth, the activities of public sector venture
capital funds are open to influence by politicians
and bureaucrats. This allows for the possibility
that investment decisions may take into account
political imperatives rather than being made
entirely on the basis of commercial criteria
(Florida and Kenney, 1988a).
Sixth, there is a risk that public sector venture
capital activity will compete with private sector
funds for good investment opportunities, and consequently driving up valuations, depressing returns
and ultimately crowding-out private sector funds.
Discussing the Canadian situation, Doyle (1993,
p. 20) notes that "in entering the venture capital
field, the provinces felt they would provide an
incentive for other venture capital c o m p a n i e s . . .
to enter the high risk end of the investment
spectrum. However, if an in-depth study were
done, it would probably show that they are driving
them away".
Finally, Florida and Kenney (1988a) emphasise
that simply enhancing the supply of venture
capital is not sufficient for an increase in venture
capital activity. They point out that venture capitalists - whether operating in the public or private
sector - are critically dependent upon technical,
social and financial networks to locate investments, structure deals and support investee businesses. Thus, public sector venture capital funds
need a supportive institutional environment of
business support services, notably specialised
law and accountancy firms, in order to be effective. In support of this argument Florida and
Kenney (1988a) point out that public sector
venture capital funds have been most successful
in regions where there is an active private venture
capital industry.

Subsidising the operating costs of private sector
venture capital funds
Another approach to increasing the supply of seed,
start-up and early stage capital is to provide a
subsidy to private sector venture capital funds to
offset their appraisal and monitoring costs. One of
the major reasons for the lack of private sector
venture capital funds specialising in seed and startup investments is that such investments require a
very active hands-on role. As a result, they incur
high costs and uncertain returns. The appraisal of
small investment proposals and the management
of a portfolio of small investments requires almost
as much input of professional and other resources
as those which are several times larger, while the
professional fees that can be commanded are lower
and the risks are much greater. Indeed, the need to
make a larger number of investments in order to
get a reasonable spread of risk further contributes
to the high appraisal and monitoring costs of seed
and start-up funds. The British Venture Capital
Association (BVCA) has estimated that the real
cost of running a seed fund is between £150,000
and £200,000, depending upon its location, which
represents an unacceptably high proportion of
the funds under management (BVCA, 1989). It
is therefore difficult for venture capital funds
specialising in seed and start-up investments to
operate under conventional commercial criteria.
The objective of the subsidy is to make this type
of investment activity an economic proposition for
private sector organisations.
This approach has been adopted by the
European Community by means of its Seed
Capital Initiative. This initiative, which has initial
funding of approximately ECU 40m, has supported the establishment of 24 new seed capital
funds across the Community, including three in the
UK, by contributing towards their operating costs
(up to 50 per cent) and capital resources (up to
25 per cent). The intention was that the funds
would become self-financing within five years.
However, this initiative has had only limited
success. Murray (1995) suggests that the funds are
too small to be sustainable without ongoing EC
support and few have the financial resources to
provide successive rounds of follow-on finance
that is required by successful and rapidly growing
young companies.

<-----Page 8----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap
An alternative approach is a British initiative,
formally launched in November 1991 by Business
in the Community, to establish a network of
regionally-based development capital funds and
professional advisory networks. The intention was
for each regional enterprise fund to be set up with
a life of ten years and a maximum of 20 corporate investors drawn from and investing in the
region. The key feature of this initiative was that,
in order to alleviate the burden of professional
fees and vetting costs which have previously made
it unprofitable to provide equity finance in small
amounts, professional firms (fund managers,
stockbrokers, solicitors, accountants and bankers)
will waive up to 60 per cent of their fees to
undertake investigative work on serious projects
(McMeekin, 1991). However, this scheme - which
has also encountered fund-raising problems - also
seems likely to have only a limited impact on the
equity gap in the UK, firstly, because the number
of investments that are anticipated is limited
(about 15 per region), and secondly, because the
primary investment focus of the funds will be to
provide finance for the expansion of existing businesses (McMeekin, 1991).
Another approach, exemplified by the BJU
scheme in Germany and the PPM scheme in The
Netherlands, is for government to assume part
of the costs of investment losses when venture
capital firms invest in types of businesses or
sectors which are considered to have wider
economic or technical benefits. However, this
approach may encounter the moral hazard situation, encouraging venture capitalists to make less
prudent investments by removing the "risk" from
equity investments.

An alternative approach: Improving the
efficiency of the informal venture capital
market
A more promising strategy for increasing the
supply of start-up and early stage venture capital
is the promotion of informal investment which, it
can be argued (e.g. Walker, t989), is more appropriate than venture capital as a source of early
stage finance. Informal investors - alternatively
termed private venture capitalists but more
commonly referred to as 'business angels' - are
private investors who provide risk capital directly

16 t

to new and growing businesses in which they have
had no prior connection (i.e. it excludes investments in their own firm or in a family business)°
Comparisons of informal investors in the
USA, UK, Canada and Sweden reveal few significant differences in their characteristics, investment preferences and investment activity (Wetzet,
1981; Tymes and Krasner, 1983; Haar etaL, 1988;
Gaston, 1989; Riding and Short, t987a; t987b;
Short and Riding, 1989; Venture Economics, 1990;
Harrison and Mason, 1992a; Landstr6m, 1993;
Riding et at., 1993). Business angels are almost
exclusively male and mostly in the 45+ age band.
The vast majority are either business owners,
company directors or business-related professionals (eg accountants, consultants). Most are
also experienced entrepreneurs, often having
founded several businesses. They are generally
self-made and have a high net worth (although relatively few are in the super-rich category) (Table
I). On account of their employment background
angels have a fair degree of financial sophistication and are capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of prospective investments (WetzeL 1987).
There are three major reasons why the informal
venture capital market should be supported by
policy-makers: the nature of the investments made
by business angels, the localized nature of their
investments and the overall size of the market.
(i) Business angels invest precisely in those
areas in which institutional venture capital providers are reluctant to invest. They typically make
small investments, well below the minimum size
of investment considered by most venture capital
funds. In the UK the vast majority of angels invest
less than £50,000 in a single deal (although deal
sizes that involve investments that are syndicated
between a number of investors are larger) (Mason
et aL, 1991a) (Table !I). A study of sources of
external equity sources used by new technologybased firms in New England found that private
investors provided 84 per cent of financing rounds
under $250,000, compared with 13 per cent by
venture capital funds, but only l0 per cent of
rounds of over $1 million compared with 69 per
cent by venture capital funds (Freear and Wetzel,
1988).
Investments by private investors are also relatively more concentrated in start-ups and early
stage ventures whereas most venture capital funds

provide development capital and finance for management buy-outs and buy-ins (Table II). Indeed,
business angels are often the only source of early
stage equity capital for businesses that have
exhausted personal and family sources. More than
two-thirds of investments by Canadian business
angels are in the seed, start-up and early stages
(Venture Economics, 1990). In their study of new
technology-based firms in New England Freear
and Wetzel (1988) found that private investors
outnumbered venture capital funds by two-to-one
at seed and start-up stages. They conclude that
"private individuals and venture capital funds
appear to play complementary.., r o l e s . . . Private
individuals are most prominent at the early stages
of a firm's development, when relatively small
amounts are involved, and in those later stage
financings involving under $1 million" (Freear and
Wetzel, 1988, p. 353).
Informal venture capital is also "smart money".
Business angels are value-added investors, contributing their commercial skills, entrepreneurial
experience, business know-how and contacts
through a variety of hands-on roles (Table II). One
study of firms that had raised finance from
informal investors (Harrison and Mason, 1992b)
identified a wide range of support, monitoring and
~trategic roles played by business angels in their
in vestee companies. Entrepreneurs regarded the
angels' role as a sounding board for the manage-

ment team as being their most valuable "hands on"
contribution. The opportunity to be involved in an
entrepreneurial venture is a significant motivating
factor for angels making informal venture capital
investments, as well as a means of protecting their
investment.
(ii) Business angels are much more geographically dispersed that venture capital funds. Gaston
(1989) suggests that angels live virtually everywhere, although in view of their entrepreneurial
backgrounds they are likely to be most numerous
in regions with a large SME sector. UK evidence
indicates that business angels are found throughout
the country although, as might be anticipated,
are over-represented in the south (Mason et al.,
1991a) and have invested larger amounts (£35,000
compared with £19,000 in the three years preceding the survey). Furthermore, investments by
business angels are characterised by a high level
of geographic localisation. A majority of all such
investments are made in firms located within
50-100 miles of the investor's home or office
(Table II). This is largely a reflection of the 'hands
on' nature of such investments, although is also a
function of superior information available about
investment opportunities close to home. Thus,
from a regional development perspective informal
investments are valuable because they help to
retain and re-circulate wealth within a region,
counteracting the effect of most investment mech-

anisms (e.g. banks, insurance companies, pension
funds) which act as a conduit through which
personal savings flow out of peripheral regions to
the nation's financial centres for investment in
core regions and abroad.
(iii) In terms of its size, the informal venture
capital market is the largest single source of risk
capital for entrepreneurial companies, substantially dwarfing the institutional venture capital
industry. Wetzel and Freear (1993) note that in the
USA the scale of the informal venture capital
market is at least five times that of the institutional
venture capital market in terms of dollars invested
annually and is at least twenty times larger in
terms of the number of ventures financed. Gaston
(1989) suggests that informal investors provide
capital to over 40 times the number of firms
receiving investments from professional venture
capital funds, and the amount of their investments
almost exceeds all other sources of external equity
capital for new and growing small businesses
combined. Estimates for the UK suggest that
SMEs have raised about £2 billion from the
informal venture capital market. By comparison,
Bannock (1991) estimates that the formal venture
capital industry has some £1.25bn invested in
SMEs in the UK, suggesting that the informal
venture capital market is almost twice as important to the SME sector as formal venture capital
(Harrison and Mason, 1993).
The potential scale of the informal venture
capital market is considerably greater than these
figures suggest. First, a number of research studies
confirm that most business angels cannot find sufficient investment opportunities that meet their
criteria and so have substantial amounts of finance
available for informal investments. A survey of
informal investors in the UK found that threequarters would have invested more in the last three
years if they had come across a greater number
of suitable investment opportunities. On average,
these investors had a further £50,000 available for
investment. In aggregate, the sample of informal
investors had up to £10 million available for
investment, equivalent to three times the total
amount that they had invested during the previous
three years (Mason et al., 1991a). A study of
business angels in Scotland also found that they
have excess funds. However, it was not possible
to put a figure on the amount available because

the angels questioned in the study claimed not to
set aside specific sums for specific investment
purposes (KPMG, 1992). In the USA, Gaston
(1989) found that 54 per cent of investors wanted
to invest more than the volume of opportunities
permitted. The surplus funds of these investors
was 51 per cent more than they had invested;
averaged over all investors the amount of uncommitted finance was 35 per cent more than they had
invested.
Many angels contend that there is a shortage
of good quality investment proposals, although
this may be associated, at least in part, with poor
presentation by entrepreneurs. However, shortcomings in the search process by entrepreneurs
and investors also play a significant role in contributing to their lack of suitable investment
opportunities. Most informal investors are not able
to devote significant amounts of time to what is
generally a spare-time activity. As a result, most
adopt a fairly passive approach to the identification of investment opportunities, looking in an ad
hoc, unscientific fashion, placing considerable
reliance on friends and business associates for
referrals and they rarely adopt a pro-active search
(Mason et al., 1991a). Thus, there is a large degree
of serendipity in the number and quality of deals
that come to an investor's attention. Studies in
the USA and the UK indicate that a majority
of informal investors are dissatisfied with their
referral sources and believe that there is a need for
improved channels of communication between
investors and businesses seeking risk capital
(Wetzel, 1981; Myers and Moline, 1988; Mason
and Harrison, 1992a). New entrants to the
informal venture capital market who have taken
early retirement or redundancy, or are returning
ex-patriots, or in some other way are isolated from
informal referral networks, for example, due to
employment background or location, are often particularly dissatisfied with the available sources of
deal flow (KPMG, 1992). UK research indicates
that investors in the peripheral regions express the
greatest dissatisfaction with their existing referral
sources. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are hampered
in their search for private sources of venture
capital by the anonymity which most informal
investors strive to preserve. As Gaston (1989,
p. 1) has observed, both the search by a business
for an investor, and the search by an investor for

<-----Page 12----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap
an investment opportunity "can b e . . . expensive,
time-consuming affair[s]. The search is studded
with pitfalls and dead ends that often result in
failure and frustration". This, in turn, leads him
to describe the informal venture capital market as
"a giant game of hide-and-seek with everyone
blindfolded" (Gaston, 1989, p. 4).
Second, as Freear and Wetzel (1992) note,
"virgin angels" - individuals with the same selfmade, high net worth characteristics as active
angels but who have not, for whatever reason,
entered the informal venture capital market as
individual investors - considerably outnumber
active investors. According to Freear et al. (1992)
the number of high net worth individuals - defined
as a net worth of $1 million or more - in the USA
has been estimated to be about two million, of
whom 80 to 90 per cent are self-made. They go on
to point out that the self-made characteristic of the
high net worth population is significant "because
it implies that many of them have acquired the
kind of experience.., that it takes to start, manage
and harvest a successful entrepreneurial venture.
In a sense, their entire professional careers
have prepared them to conduct the due diligence
necessary to evaluate the merits and the risks of
prospective investments and to add the value of
their know-how to the ventures they bankroll"
(p. 5). However, Wetzel and Freear (1993)
estimate that there are about 200,000 angels in the
USA. Thus, there are up to ten times as many
virgin angels as active angels. Riding and Short
(1987a) estimate that active angels in OttawaCarleton comprise only 5 per cent of those with
similar demographic characteristics. The number
of active business angels is therefore only a small
fraction of the potential number of private
investors.
Research by Freear et al. (1992) in New
England indicates that with the right enticements
over half of virgin angels could become active
investors in entrepreneurial ventures. A smallscale survey of virgin angels in the UK indicates
that their inability to identify firms which require
finance is the main reason why they have never
invested in entrepreneurial companies. Other frequently cited factors are the high risks involved,
concerns about exit routes and their lack of expertise to appraise investment opportunities (Mason
and Harrison, 1993a). A slightly different set of

165

factors for not investing emerge from the virgin
angels that KPMG (1992) briefly discussed in
their study of the informal venture capital market
in Scotland. Their conclusion was that these individuals were not active in the informal venture
capital market principally because of unacceptable
risks and a lack of tax benefits. Four factors therefore seem relevant in seeking to convert virgin
angels into active investors (Mason and Harrison,
1993a). First, virgin angels would be prepared
to invest in companies where they knew the
management team personally, a major factor in
reducing the perceived risk factor in an investment
(Binks et aL, 1992). Second, virgin angels might
be willing to invest if they received information
from a trustworthy source on companies which
wish to raise finance. The availability of tax incentives is a third factor that might encourage virgin
angels to invest. Both the KPMG (1992) study and
also US findings have noted that reduction in the
capital gains tax would be the most influential
factor in inducing virgin investors to become
active investors (Freear et aL, 1992). Finally, US
evidence indicates that opportunities to participate
with other, more experienced, investors was
seen by virgin angets as a major inducement to
becoming active (Freear et al., 1992). In contrast,
UK virgin angels were not influenced by this consideration, a finding that is consistent with the
much lower levels of syndication of investments
reported by active informal investors in tile UK
compared with their US counterparts (Harrison
and Mason, 1992a).
Research findings from a number of countries
therefore clearly indicate that there is considerable
scope for assisting those angels with substantial uncommitted sums of money available for
informal investments in finding suitable investment opportunities and also for increasing the
population of business angels. The policy implication is therefore that efforts to increase the
supply of small amounts of venture capital for
start-up and early stage ventures, especially in
areas where institutional sources of venture
capital are lacking, should be directed towards initiatives which will overcome the information gap
between entrepreneurs seeking finance and
business angels seeking investment opportunities.
We consider an appropriate mechanism in the
following section.

Business introduction services: A mechanism
for stimulating the informal venture capital
market
The most promising strategy to promote informal
venture capital involves the establishment of
business introduction services - or "financial
marriage bureaux". There are examples of such
services .in the USA, Canada, the UK and
Scandinavia (see examples in Harrison and Mason,
1995). Business introduction services attempt to
overcome the two major sources of inefficiency in
the informal venture capital market, namely the
invisibility of business angels and the high search
costs of angels for businesses and businesses for
angels, by providing a channel of communication
between informal investors and entrepreneurs
seeking finance. This enables entrepreneurs to
bring their investment proposals to the attention
of a number of private investors simultaneously
and provides investors with a timely and confidential means of identifying and examining a
range of investment proposals.
The most straightforward approach to "'matchmaking" is through the production and distribution of an investment bulletin giving a brief
description of companies seeking capital which is
circulated to potential investors. Another method
involves investor forums at which entrepreneurs
seeking to raise finance make short presentations
to an audience of potential investors. A more
sophisticated approach involves computer matching which was pioneered by the Venture Capital
Network which was established in New England
in 1984 (Wetzel, 1984; Foss, 1985; Freear and
Wetzel, 1995).
The experience of business introduction organisations in the USA and Canada suggests that such
services cannot be operated as a profit-making
activity. The creation and rapid disappearance of
a considerable number of private sector matchmaking services in the UK in recent years would
also seem to confirm the difficulty of operating
such an activity on a commercial basis. A business
introduction service requires professional staff to
market the service to businesses and potential
investors and to provide counselling and advice to
businesses seeking to register with the service. A
business introduction service will also require a
sizeable marketing budget. The main source of

revenue for business introduction services is the
subscription fees levied on firms and investors.
Operators have set fees for investors and businesses in the £100/$200-$300 range on the
assumption that potential clients would be
unwilling to pay significantly higher charges. The
amount of revenue that can be generated from subscription fees is therefore limited and unlikely to
be sufficient to cover the operating costs of a
business introduction service. Thus, business
introduction services have had to rely on government funding, or, in its absence, sponsorship from
the corporate sector and their sponsoring organizations (eg chambers of commerce, universities).
Venture Capital Report, a UK private sector
initiative, has sought to operate profitably by
charging the business a "success fee" calculated
on the basis of the risk capital raised (defined
broadly to include loans and loan guarantees) in
addition to the standard subscription fees levied
on businesses and subscribers to the magazine.
However, this method of raising revenue has not
enabled VCR to operate on a commercial basis
(Cary, t992). Moreover, many US and Canadian
commentators argue that it is inappropriate for
business introduction services to have any financial interest in the outcome of the negotiations
which follow the introduction since it might be
perceived by businesses and investors as compromising their impartiality, while any attempt to
run a business introduction service on a for-profit
basis is likely to reduce its credibility amongst
both investors and firms (Mason and Harrison,
1992b).
Business introduction services remain at the
experimental stage and so far most have had only
modest success in unlocking the substantial sums
of uncommitted money that most business angels
have available. This is illustrated by the case of
LINC, a UK initiative which currently operates
through local enterprise agencies in nine localities.
It has a small client base which has recently stabilized at about 200 investors and about the
same number of businesses. This reflects LINC's
low awareness amongst informal investors, small
business owners and professional intermediaries
(e.g. accountants, bankers, solicitors) (Mason
et al., 1991b; KPMG, 1992) which is, in turn, a
function of its lack of financial resources which
has limited its marketing and promotion efforts,

<-----Page 14----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

allied to its patchy geographical coverage. Many
LINC agencies do not even have any dedicated
staff or marketing budget to promote the service
locally. More fundamentally, the scale of informal
investment activity resulting from LINC's endeavours has been limited. Between 1987 and mid1993 only about 80 businesses have raised finance
from informal investors to whom they were introduced through LINC, with the total investment
amount-ing to £3.75 million. Thus, participation
in LINC has not significantly enhanced the ability
of investors to find suitable investment opportunities. Indeed, 86 per cent of LINC investors
would have invested more if they had come across
sufficient investment opportunities. They had an
average of £100,000 still available for investment.
In aggregate, the amount that the sample of LINC
investors had available for investment exceeded
the amount that they had invested during the preceding three years by some 40 per cent (Mason
and Harrison, 1993b).
Computerised business introduction services
in the USA and Canada have also had a limited
impact on the flow of informal venture capital.
With only a few exceptions computerised matching networks have had limited success in attracting
investors and entrepreneurs, with an average
(based on responses from 10 networks) of just 42
investors (ranging from 3 to 163) and 73 entrepreneurs (ranging from 3 to 223). These low
figures are attributed partly to the short time
period that most have been operating but primarily
to their limited budgets which has restricted their
marketing efforts to the production of a brochure
and little else (Brown and Stowe, t991).
VCN's performance in recruiting investors and
clients is more impressive, reflecting its longer
period of operation, and demonstrates the potential of business introduction services. VCN has
attracted a cumulative total of approximately 1200
entrepreneur clients and about 800 im,'estor clients
over the period 1984 to 1990. About 35,000 initial
computer matches resulted in about 3500 investor
requests for introductions to entrepreneurs.
Moreover, three out of every four entrepreneurs
have received at least one introduction to a potential investor, and most have received five or
six introductions. However, only a small number
of successful matches appear to have resulted.
VCN is aware of only 31 companies which have

167

successfully raised finance from investors to
whom they have been introduced, although it
should be noted that this will be an under-estimate
as, under Securities and Exchange Commission
regulations governing the operation of the service,
VCN cannot do any systematic follow-up of the
results of meetings between investors and entrepreneurs and must rely on ad hoc word-of-mouth,
third party and press reports of successful matches
(Wetzet and Freear, t995).
Thus, while the concept of a business introduction service remains sound the way in which
it has been implemented has been sub-optimal.
Case studies of various business introduction
services in North America and the UK highlight
four factors critical to their success (Mason and
Harrison, 1992b; Wetzel and Freear, 1995). First,
there is a need to build a critical mass of investor
and entrepreneur clients. Private investors are a
diverse and dispersed group who are difficult to
reach through traditional marketing techniques. A
business introduction service is an unfamiliar
concept. Like all such concepts it does not immediately sell itself and requires to be explained,
ideally on a face-to-face basis (Wetzel, t987).
Various studies indicate that when the concept of
a business introduction service is explained, the
majority of business angels express an interest
in participating (Wetzel, 1981; Riding and Short,
1987a). Building a client base of businesses is less
problematic. The challenge here is to attract
quality business opportunities and filter out businesses that are obviously "lemons" (Riding et aL,
1993): without a flow of good quality investment
opportunities, it is unlikely that business introduction services will be able to retain their
investor clients for very long. Recruiting investors
and entrepreneurs to a business introduction
service therefore requires energy, creativity and
missionary zeal (Wetzel and Freear, 1995). The
key is to achieve high visibility and credibility
in the local/regional business community, for
example, by speaking engagements at all kinds
of professional and civic organisations, developing
networks with organisations that can be a source
of high quality referrals and maximizing public
relations opportunities that will lead to articles
in newspapers and magazines and coverage on
TV and radio. Inevitably this takes time to
achieve.

<-----Page 15----->168

Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison

Second, business introduction services must be
well resourced. Since it is not possible to run a
business introduction service on the basis of fees
from investors and entrepreneurs alone (Mason
and Harrison, 1992b) they must rely on public
sector support and/or sponsorship. Their effectiveness depends upon the size of their budget.
Brown and Stowe (1991) have demonstrated
that there is a direct correlation between funding
and the number of investors and entrepreneurs
recruited to the service. Few of the match-making
services that they studied in the USA had sufficient funding to allow any marketing beyond producing information brochures. However, without
sufficient funding it is not possible to run an
ongoing high profile marketing campaign which
is necessary to maintain a flow of new investors
and investment opportunities.
Third, a business introduction service should
not rely on passive approaches to match-making.
Successful match-making is a very hands-on and
pro-active process: "passive networks drop the
ball just when the real work begins" (De Jordy,
1992, p. 208). KPMG (1992) report that the
business angels in their study would welcome
some form of prior vetting of investment opportunities. However, Wetzel, who founded VCN,
argues against vetting on philosophical, practical
and regulatory grounds (Wetzel and Freear, 1995).
From a philosophical position investors themselves can be presumed to be the best judges
of investment opportunities and entrepreneurs
should be advised to do their own evaluations of
potential investors. The practical consideration is
the cost of employing qualified staff to screen
investment proposals and investor qualifications.
Finally, the decision not to undertake any screening enabled VCN to operate without registering
as an investment advisor or broker/dealer with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, VCN did recognise that investors and
entrepreneurs need information about the process
of making investments. In response to this need,
it has run a series of workshops designed to raise
investor and entrepreneur competence and confidence in their ability to negotiate the price and
other terms and conditions of a venture investment. Workshops for investors have included such
issues as structuring equity investments, valuation
and exit routes while those for entrepreneurs have

covered the issue of "dealing with investors"°
These workshops have also been effective in
enhancing VCN's visibility and credibility and in
reaching potential clients (Wetzel and Freear,
1995).
Finally, we believe that in order to be credible
with both investors and firms a business introduction service needs to be managed by a
respected but disinterested third party with broadbased community support which operates on a notfor-profit basis. Examples include local enterprise
agencies, chambers of commerce (as in the case
of COIN in Canada), universities (as in the case
of VCN in the US) and Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) (as in the case of the DTI
informal investment demonstration projects in the
UK). Both entrepreneurs and investors need to
be comfortable that the managers of a business
introduction service are genuinely interested in
fostering local economic development, have no
vested interest in encouragiug inappropriate
matches and would maintain strict confidentiality.
Such organisations also need to have a high profile
in the local community, be well networked and be
perceived by investors and entrepreneurs as accessible and approachable (Government of Ontario,
1986).
Conclusion

There is widespread agreement that an equity gap
exists for companies seeking small amounts of
risk capital which constrains the development of
the SME sector. While this is a national problem,
evident in the UK, USA and Canada, it is particularly acute in peripheral regions which lack
an indigenous venture capital industry. Various
policy initiatives designed to increase the regional
supply of venture capital have, at best, provided
only a partial, and costly, solution. In these
circumstances, encouragement of the informal
venture capital market becomes an important
option for small firm policy-makers. The pool of
informal venture capital is already significant, and
there is considerably scope for expanding the
size of this pool, but it is largely untapped by
SMEs because of inefficiencies in its operation.
To expand the informal investment market, therefore, requires a mechanism which overcomes the
high search costs incurred by investors in seeking

<-----Page 16----->Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

investment opportunities and entrepreneurs seeking private investors. The most appropriate means
of achieving this objective is through the establishment of a network of locally or regionally
based business introduction services. By providing
an efficient channel of communication between
business angels and entrepreneurs this can help
improve investment flow from both active and
virgin angels.
The experience of existing business introduction services indicates that their impact is a
function of three key factors. First, they must be
well-resourced. In view of the economics of operating such services, which are unlikely to be
capable of operating on a non-subsidised, for
profit-basis, public sector support will be required.
This can be justified in terms of the wider
economic and technical benefits that will arise by
enabling businesses to overcome the financial and
know-how constraints to start-up and growth.
Moreover, the financial commitment required is
minuscule compared with the costs of alternative
strategies for closing the regional equity gap.
Public sector support for a business introduction
services therefore gives "a bigger bang for the
buck". Second, business introduction services
must devote considerable energy and creativity to
the ongoing marketing of the service to potential
investors and entrepreneurs. Third, they need to
undertake pro-active matching, including providing training courses to teach investors the
techniques for successful venture investing and
entrepreneurs the techniques for successfully
raising venture capital.
However, it is important that local and regional
efforts to promote informal venture capital by
means of business introduction services are
undertaken in the context of supportive national
government initiatives. First, it is important that
measures are enacted to make the treatment of
equity investment in unquoted companies no less
favourable than other forms of saving and investment. The treatment of capital gains and the availability of roll-over relief for capital losses are
particularly relevant in this context. Second, the
regulation of investments (Financial Services Act
in the UK and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the USA) should have sufficient
flexibility so as not to deter informal venture
capital activity.
