Giving Customers a
Fair Hearing
With a clear definition
of what a customer
need is, companies
are able to get
the inputs that are
required to succeed
at innovation.

and Lance A. Bettencourt

s there agreement in your company that innovation is the key to growth? Is there agreement that understanding customer needs is the key to success in innovation? Is there
agreement on what a customer need is? We have asked this series of questions to people
in hundreds of companies, and in doing so have made a surprising discovery. Even though
there is broad agreement that innovation is the key to growth and that understanding customer needs is the key to innovation, not even 5% of the companies said there was
agreement within their company as to what a customer need is. This suggests a very disconcerting question: How can a company confidently uncover customer needs, determine
which are unmet and systematically create products that address them if it cannot agree on
what a customer need is to begin with? The answer is it can‚Äôt ‚Äî and this is a root cause of
failure in the innovation process.
Most companies already understand that there are four basic approaches to product
and service innovation: growing core markets, capitalizing on adjacent market opportunities, discovering new markets and disrupting existing markets. But when it comes
to understanding customer needs, voice-of-the-customer programs are undermined in
two ways. First, there is no consistent standard that defines just what a ‚Äúneed‚Äù is ‚Äî what
its purpose, structure, content and format should be. Although companies talk to customers, the inputs they gather differ in purpose, structure, content and format,
introducing variability that can derail the innovation process. Second, companies do
not understand that to succeed at all these innovation strategies, two very different
types of customer inputs are needed ‚Äî in other words, they do not realize just how a
‚Äúneed‚Äù must be defined given the type of innovation initiative being pursued. Only
when companies learn what needs are will they be able to consistently uncover hidden
opportunities for growth through innovation.
Our purpose here is to introduce a set of timeless standards that define the purpose,
structure, content and format of a customer need statement and thereby to transform the
art of requirements gathering, and hence innovation, into a rules-based discipline. These
standards, and the theory that supports them, are the result of our analysis of over 10,000
customer need statements collected for products and services covering nearly every industry. These standards apply to the four basic innovation strategies and other innovation
strategies that a company might pursue and can benefit any company that wishes to bring
predictability to the process of innovation.

<-----Page 2----->The Characteristics of a Requirement Statement
Companies need to remember that it‚Äôs not enough to just solicit
opinions; getting the right information is crucial. Customer requirements are used by companies to inform and guide many
marketing and development decisions ‚Äî and to drive the innovation process. Generally speaking, they are sought to ensure that
critical business decisions related to marketing, development and
innovation are optimized for the creation of customer value.
Marketing, for example, relies on customer requirements to
help uncover customers‚Äô unmet needs and to find segments of
customers with unique unmet needs. Those needs represent hidden opportunities for value creation. Competitive intelligence
uses customer requirements to help determine the strengths and
weaknesses of the company and its competitors. The development team depends on these requirements to determine how
best to improve existing products, devise altogether new products, and evaluate product concepts and ideas. The design team
relies on them to make design trade-off decisions. When it
comes to messaging, these requirements are used by the communications group to help decide how best to position a product
and communicate its value. These decisions are key in achieving
growth through innovation and must be informed with comIllustration: Adam McCauley/theispot.com

plete and accurate data. To make customer input useful to the
entire company, it must possess these six characteristics:
1. The statement must reflect the customer‚Äôs definition of
value. It must not be an interpretation or a translation of what
the customer values. It must not be the company‚Äôs perception of
how customers measure value or how they think customers
should measure value. It is all too common for companies to inadvertently translate what the customer has said into something
inaccurate or misleading. Value must be defined and measured
from the customer‚Äôs perspective; otherwise, it is a useless input
for identifying hidden opportunities and carrying out other marketing and development activities.
2. The statement must have universal acceptance. A requirement must be relevant to all customers, regardless of geographic
location, gender and income level. Otherwise, a different set of
requirements is needed from every possible demographic ‚Äî
making regional, national and global innovation, positioning
and branding near impossible.
3. The statement must be relevant now and in the future.
The underlying need for a product must not change quickly over
time, or it will be a moving target that is impossible to hit. It must
have the same intended meaning and relevance now as it did 10

years ago and will 10 years from now (for example, people needed
tools for cooking before the microwave was introduced). Without
this characteristic, companies will not be able to decide today
what features to include in a product that may take three to five
years to bring to market.
4. The statement must prompt a course of action. A customer requirement must indicate what action to take to solve the
problem. Merely finding out that a product must be more reliable, comfortable or easy to use ‚Äî inputs that each customer will
define differently ‚Äî does little to guide the actions of engineers
and designers. If you can‚Äôt measure value, you won‚Äôt know if you
are on the path toward creating it.
5. The statement‚Äôs meaning must not be open to interpretation.
A customer requirement must be precise and clear enough so that
all who read it arrive at the same interpretation of its meaning. This
transparency in meaning must begin with the customer, but it also
extends to all downstream users of the information such as sales and
marketing staff, design engineers and others. Just about every product could benefit from being faster, better and cheaper ‚Äî but those
dimensions must be specifically defined for every case.
6. The statement itself must not confound the way it or other
statements are prioritized. A good experiment seeks to determine
which specific factor is causing an effect, and it does this by controlling all other sources of variation. The same must be done when

prioritizing customer needs. Shifts in structure, content and format
may introduce unwanted sources of variability that confound requirement prioritization when requirements are prioritized using
phone, face-to-face or Web-based market research surveys. If some
statements begin with a verb and others begin with an adjective, if
some statements include a solution and others do not, then it‚Äôs questionable which one is more important. This is arguably the greatest
weakness of most requirement statements today, as a lack of discipline here causes companies to pursue the wrong opportunities and
to miss others altogether. When solutions are included in a need
statement, for example, we see lower ratings given to that statement
than a similar statement that is void of solutions ‚Äî consequently, an
unmet need may not be identified if it contains a solution.

Rules for Creating a Requirement Statement

In science, conducting one successful experiment is not enough
to prove a hypothesis ‚Äî the experiment must be replicable. If,
time and again, the same conditions produce the same results,
then you‚Äôre onto something. The same is true when it comes to
customer requirements. Any random set of statements may result in a successful innovation once in a while, but are the
results replicable?
To ensure that a requirement statement drives predictable
results, it must possess the six characteristics stated above, but
this will not happen by chance; the statement must be fashioned in a disciplined

<-----Page 4----->From the customer‚Äôs perspective, it is the job that is the stable,
long-term focal point around which value creation should be
centered. Current products and services are merely point-in-time
solutions that enable customers to execute jobs. A vinyl record, a
CD and an MP3 file, for example, all help customers get the job
of storing music done. Focusing on creating a better record
doesn‚Äôt help in the creation of a CD or MP3 device, but focusing
on the job of storing music supports the discovery and creation
of new ways to help customers get the job done better ‚Äî which
is the essence of innovation.
Focusing on the job as the unit of analysis has two additional
benefits. First, it eliminates the need to worry about latent or
unarticulated needs, because thoughtfully selected customers
are always able to articulate their requirements for getting a job
done better and to indicate what related jobs they want to get
done, even in markets for which products do not yet exist.
Second, a focus on jobs ensures that the requirements captured
are universal and have a shared relevance (although perhaps not
importance) among customers worldwide: Requirements captured
in the United States, for example, are valid for the customer population in Europe and Asia, and new or different requirements for a
job rarely are seen across geographic location. Surgeons around the
world have the same requirements for executing a surgical procedure, corn farmers around the world have the same requirements
for farming corn and retirees have the same requirements for managing finances. Why? Because in each instance, the individuals are
trying to get the same job done ‚Äî and they execute it in a similar
way and measure success in a common fashion. The job is what
they have in common, and it supports a universal language for requirements gathering.
Rule 2: The requirement statement must not include or make
mention of a technology, solution or product or service feature.
Innovation is the process of devising solutions that address unmet
customer needs (in our terminology, requirements); solutions are
the means by which unmet needs are satisfied. Consequently, when
talking with customers to obtain their requirements, companies
must focus only on capturing those requirements ‚Äî and these
statements must not include or make mention of a solution in any
form. When a solution-oriented statement is introduced into the
mix, it contaminates the data. We know that this is a widespread
problem because many companies use scaling methods such as
paired comparison and forced choice to get customers taking a
survey to make trade-offs between the attributes of various solutions, a practice that is totally unwarranted when trying to figure
out which needs are unmet.
In addition, requirement statements that contain solutions are
not stable over time. If a company manufacturing music media
back in the 1970s, for example, believed that one customer requirement was bigger records that would hold more songs (a requirement
statement that contains a solution: bigger records), it might have
SLOANREVIEW.MIT.EDU

created a larger record. But years
later, the solutions customers envision for their music storage
problems would not even include
records. Statements that include
solutions soon become obsolete,
and companies that accept them as
customer requirements come to
believe that customer needs change
quickly over time.
On the other hand, if our hypothetical 1970s music media
company recognized that the requirement really was that
customers wanted to increase the
number of songs that could be
stored for play, it would have been
more likely to look beyond existing technologies to devise a
next-generation solution. This solution-free statement was valid
years ago as well as today, and
because it is stable over time, it
creates a long-term target for
value creation.
Rule 3: The requirement statement must not include
ambiguous terms. The statement
must not include words that may
be interpreted differently across a
customer population or across
functional areas within the company, leading to disagreement as
to the intent of the requirement statement. Ambiguous words
come in a variety of flavors. The most obvious are unfamiliar or
complex words that require a definition, but others are abbreviated words, symbols, acronyms and jargon. All must be avoided.
A less obvious source of ambiguity comes from the inclusion of
certain adjectives in the requirement statement. We often see adjectives used as an integral part of the requirement. For example,
customers may say they want the product or service to be more
reliable, durable, comfortable, fresh, clean, etc. These are high-level
descriptors of quality, and every industry seems to have its own
favored terms. Corn farmers, for example, want their corn to be
‚Äústandable.‚Äù Such words must be defined with precision, and when
doing so, several actual requirements can be extracted.
Adverbs also are used in requirement statements to describe a
desired action, but they tend to leave the requirement open to interpretation. For example, when corn farmers state that they want
to increase the percentage of corn plants that emerge from the
ground correctly, the adverb ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù could be interpreted in

<-----Page 6----->Job Statements When trying to capitalize on adjacent market opportunities or discover opportunities for new market creation,
the customer need takes the form of a job statement, as companies are trying to determine which jobs customers are having
trouble getting done. In these two circumstances, the goal of the
interviewer is to solicit job statements. (For a structure and format
that we have defined for a job statement, see ‚ÄúThe Structure of a
Job Statement,‚Äù p. 64.)
Because a job specifies the action for which a solution is
needed, a job statement must at a minimum contain a verb to
introduce the statement and an object of the verb that defines
the job to be done. Optionally, a job statement may contain a
contextual clarifier, such as ‚Äúcommunicate with others while on
the go,‚Äù to describe the conditions or circumstances under which
the job needs to get done and examples that clarify, when
needed, the object of the verb. This structure ensures that the job
statements are standardized and can be acted upon.
Job statements can be captured for any demographic and
context. Once prioritized, they reveal opportunities for adjacent
and new market growth. For example, potentially underserved
jobs for retired people over 65 may include wanting to pass on
life‚Äôs lessons to their grandchildren, reconnecting with past
friends or staying abreast of anti-aging advances. After prioritizing which jobs to address, a company is in a position to devise
new, never-before-seen products or services that will dominate
uncontested market spaces.
Desired Outcome Statements When trying to help customers get a
job done better (core market growth) or help a new set of customers perform a job that was previously performed by other, more
skilled people (disruption), customer needs are defined differently.
To get at these needs, the job of interest is first broken down into
discrete process steps. Then, for each step, the company must ascertain from customers what metrics they use to judge the
successful execution of that step ‚Äî and of the overall job. These
metrics, or desired outcomes, are the customers‚Äô needs in this situation. Once these metrics are known, the degree to which they are
satisfied becomes measurable, thus making the satisfaction of
unmet needs controllable and manageable.
When focused on core market growth and disruption, then,
the goal of the interviewer is to solicit desired outcome statements. (We first introduced this concept in ‚ÄúTurn Customer
Input into Innovation,‚Äù in the January 2002 issue of the Harvard
Business Review.) By focusing on jobs and uncovering outcomes,
over 95% of the companies we have studied have successfully
prioritized hidden opportunities in core markets and discovered
opportunities for new market creation, leading to new innovations. An outcome statement must adhere to the structure,
content and format. (See ‚ÄúThe Structure of a Desired Outcome
Statement,‚Äù p. 64.)
SLOANREVIEW.MIT.EDU

An outcome statement must at a minimum contain a direction
of improvement, a unit of measure to indicate what must be measured and controlled to improve the level of satisfaction and an
object of control. Optionally, an outcome statement may contain a
contextual clarifier to describe the conditions or circumstances
under which the outcome needs to be achieved and examples that
clarify, when needed, the object of control. The statement is structured such that the requirement‚Äôs satisfaction is measurable. If it
can be measured, it can be controlled. When it comes to getting a
job done better, a company must be able to quantify the degree to
which customer satisfaction is being improved by a new or improved product or service concept. This makes it possible to act on
the requirement.
To limit variability from statement to statement, we suggest
that each statement begin with either the word ‚Äúminimize‚Äù or
‚Äúincrease.‚Äù This eliminates variability and its associated problems with opportunity prioritization. For example, minimize,
reduce, prevent, eliminate and decrease all appear to be similar
in meaning, but significant evidence suggests that using different words to introduce the same statement in a quantitative
survey impacts the importance and satisfaction ratings that are
given by customers. In addition, because customers are typically
trying to get a job done faster, with less variability and waste, we
use the word ‚Äúminimize‚Äù to introduce outcome statements
about 90% of the time.

Popping the Questions
If you want useful ideas from customers, don‚Äôt ask them for
any ‚Äî directly, anyway. Resist questions like ‚ÄúHow would
you improve this product?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat features would you like
to see added to it?‚Äù Instead, ask them about what they know
best, which is whatever ‚Äújob‚Äù they use the product to do.
Listen closely, and they‚Äôll pinpoint unmet needs, niches
awaiting innovation.
What questions will get them talking? Try these:
What makes this job ‚Äî or parts of it ‚Äî challenging,
inconvenient or frustrating? The response should point
you toward pitfalls that you may be able to address by
creating a product.
What makes this job time-consuming? What you really
want to know is whether a product that speeds up the
process would be successful.
What causes this job to go off track? There may be an
opportunity to reduce any instability.
What aspects of this job are wasteful? If you can find a way
to boost efficiency, your innovation could be a winner.

SPRING 2008

MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW

<-----Page 7----->MARKETING

To further limit variability from statement to statement, we suggest that companies choose from a select group of metrics. In more
than 95% of our desired outcome statements, our metrics are limited to time, likelihood, frequency, amount, risk or number.
Lastly, when including examples in either a job or outcome statement, the examples must have standardized content and format. We
recommend that the example statement contain at least two examples; it must not contain a solution, technology or product feature;
and it must refer to the object of action or control. (See ‚ÄúTelling
Time: Rules for Structuring Customers‚Äô Need Statements,‚Äù p. 66.)

Best Practices for Uncovering Needs
Now that you know what you are after, how can you best capture a
solid set of customer needs? A number of innovation thought leaders swear by observational research. Others suggest using personal
interviews, dyads, triads, focus groups and customer visits. What
matters isn‚Äôt the method; rather, it is going into any customer interaction knowing what inputs you are looking for. Once companies
decide that the objective is to understand either what jobs customers are trying to get done or what metrics customers are using to
judge the successful execution of a specific job, we believe that they
can succeed using a combination of methods.
To capture desired outcomes, a four-step approach is best. The
first step is to conduct personal interviews in order to dissect the
job the customer is trying to get done into process steps. We call
this process ‚Äújob mapping.‚Äù The job map is created so the company
and the interviewer have a clear understanding of what job the
customer is trying to get done ‚Äî from the customer‚Äôs perspective.
It simplifies the data gathering process immensely if the interviewer knows which process steps to focus on when capturing
desired outcomes. Without a job map in hand, even the most experienced interviewer is likely to struggle.
The second step is to conduct one or two ethnographic or
observational interviews with customers to gain insight into the
context in which the job is getting done. This will help the interviewer be more effective at capturing and refining desired
outcome statements in subsequent interviews. These interviews
also may be used to better flesh out the job map and begin the
outcome gathering effort.
The third step is to conduct personal, small group or large
group interviews to elicit from customers what metrics they use
to measure success in executing each step of the job. This is where
the bulk of the desired outcome statements are captured. Group
interviews may be mistaken for focus groups, but the goal here is
to capture the customers‚Äô desired outcomes ‚Äî an objective that
is foreign in traditional focus groups, which are typically used to
test concepts and get general customer feedback. To uncover desired outcomes, companies should first deconstruct the job into
discrete steps and then ask, for each step, how performance is
measured. For example, when Syngenta AG, a corn seed manu68

MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW

SPRING 2008

facturer based in Basel, Switzerland, was focused on learning how
corn farmers dry the harvest ‚Äî one specific step performed as
part of the job of corn farming ‚Äî the interviewer asked, ‚ÄúWhat
makes drying the harvest slow or time consuming?‚Äù This elicited
statements relating to getting the job done faster, such as ‚ÄúMinimize the time it takes to rid the harvest of moisture.‚Äù Asking
‚ÄúWhat makes drying the harvest unpredictable, unstable, or go
off track?‚Äù helped uncover statements that related to executing
the job with less variability, such as ‚ÄúIncrease the likelihood that
all plants emerge at the same time.‚Äù Finally, asking ‚ÄúWhat is it
about drying the harvest that contributes to lower yields?‚Äù uncovered statements that relate to increasing output, such as ‚ÄúMinimize
yield loss due to excessive heat during pollination.‚Äù Through this
methodical line of questioning at each step in the value model, a
complete picture emerges of all of the customer‚Äôs unique measures of value in getting the job done.
The fourth step is to conduct interviews to fill in any missing
details that remain after completing the first three steps. A company knows that it has uncovered all the customer‚Äôs need
statements when all attempts to capture outcomes related to
speed, predictability and output have been exhausted for each
process step in the job map.
The approach used to capture job statements is similar, but capturing job statements does not require the creation of a job map.
Using a mix of personal, ethnographic and group interviews, companies can uncover all the jobs associated with a given demographic
and context. With practice, a small pool of employees can be relied
on to collect customer inputs for multiple areas of the business
when the need arises. (See ‚ÄúPopping the Questions,‚Äù p. 67.)

Adopting New Standards
Knowing what a customer need is in different situations and how
requirement statements should be structured and formatted is the
key to success in innovation. The outcome-driven innovation
model detailed here works when applied to product and service
innovation as well as design, operational, organizational and business model innovation. The concepts apply equally well in all
situations because the job is the same: to figure out what solution
best satisfies customers‚Äô unmet needs.
By questioning old assumptions, companies can finally understand why the old models have not worked and why companies
have been led astray by customer input. Job and outcome statements reflect the customer‚Äôs own definition of value, have
universal and future relevance, prompt action, circumvent misinterpretation and help identify opportunities. With a new set of
standards, companies finally can use their customers‚Äô insights to
lead them to the forefront of innovation.
