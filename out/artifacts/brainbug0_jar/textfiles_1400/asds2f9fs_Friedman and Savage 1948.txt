THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK'
MILTON FRIEDMAN. AND L. J. SAVAGE
I. THE PROBLEM AND
ITS BACKGROUND

purposeof this paper is to suggest that an important class of
reactionsof individuals to risk can
be rationalizedby a rather simple extension of orthodox utility analysis.
Individuals frequently must, or can,
choose among alternatives that differ,
among other things, in the degree of risk
to which the individual will be subject.
The clearest examples are provided by
insurance and gambling. An individual
who buys fire insurance on a house he
owns is accepting the certain loss of a
small sum (the insurance premium) in
preferenceto the combinationof a small
chanceof a much largerloss (the value of
the house) and a large chance of no loss.
That is, he is choosing certainty in
preferenceto uncertainty. An individual
who buys a lottery ticket is subjecting
himself to a large chance of losing a
small amount (the price of the lottery
ticket) plus a small chance of winning a
large amount (a prize) in preference to
avoiding both risks. He is choosing uncertainty in preferenceto certainty.
T vHE

I The
fundamental ideas of this paper were
worked out jointly by the two authors. The paper
was written primarily by the senior author.

This choice among differentdegrees of
risk so prominentin insuranceand gambling,is clearlypresentandimportantin a
much broaderrange of economic choices.
Occupationsdiffergreatly in the variability of the income they promise:in some,
for example,civil serviceemployment,the
prospective income is rather clearly defined and is almost certain to be within
rather narrow limits; in others, for example, salaried employment as an accountant, there is somewhat more variability yet almost no chance of either an
extremely high or an extremely low income; in still others, for example, motion-pictureacting, there is extreme variability, with a small chance of an extremely high income and a larger chance
of an extremely low income. Securities
vary similarly, from government bonds
and industrial "blue chips" to "bluesky" common stocks; and so do business
enterprises or lines of business activity.
Whetheror not they realizeit and whether or not they take explicit account of the
varying degree of risk involved, individuals choosing among occupations,
securities, or lines of business activity
are making choices analogous to those
that they make when they decide whether to buy insuranceor to gamble. Is there

279

<-----Page 2----->280

MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE

any consistency among the choices of
this kind that individuals make? Do
they neglect the element of risk? Or does
it play a central role? If so, what is that
role?
These problems have, of course, been
considered by economic theorists, particularly in their discussions of earnings
in different occupations and of profits
in different lines of business.2 Their treatment of these problems has, however,
never been integrated with their explanation of choices among riskless alternatives. Choices among riskless alternatives are explained in terms of maximization of utility: individuals are supposed
to choose as they would if they attributed some common quantitative
utility-to
characteristic-designated
various goods and then selected the
combination of goods that yielded the
largest total amount of this common
characteristic. Choices among alternatives involving different degrees of risk,
for example, among different occupations, are explained in utterly different
terms-by ignorance of the odds or by
the fact that "young men of an adventurous disposition are more attracted
by the prospects of a great success than
they are deterred by the fear of failure,"
by "the overweening conceit which the
greater part of men have of their own
abilities," by "their absurd presumption
in their own good fortune," or by some
similar deus ex machina.3
The rejection of utility maximization
as an explanation of choices among different degrees of risk was a direct consequence of the belief in diminishing mar2 E.g., see Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations,
Book I, chap. x (Modern Library reprint of Cannan
ed.), pp. io6-i i; Alfred Marshall, Principles of
Economics (8th ed.; London: Macmillan & Co.,
Ltd., 1920), pp. 398-400, 554-55, 613.

Smith, op. cit., p. 107 (last two quotations).

ginal utility. If the marginal utility of
money diminishes, an individual seeking
to maximizeutility will never participate
in a "fair"game of chance,for example,a
game in which he has an equal chance of
winning or losing a dollar. The gain in
utility from winning a dollar will be less
than the loss in utility from losing a dollar, so that the expected utility from participation in the game is negative. Diminishing marginal utility plus maximization of expected utility would thus imply that individuals would always have
to be paid to induce them to bear risk.4
But this implication is clearly contradicted by actual behavior. People not
only engage in fair games of chance, they
engage freely and often eagerly in such
unfair games as lotteries. Not only do
risky occupationsand risky investments
not always yield a higher average return
than relatively safe occupations or investments, they frequently yield a much
lower average return.
Marshall resolved this contradiction
by rejecting utility maximization as an
explanationof choices involving risk. He
need not have done so, since he did not
need diminishing marginal utility-or,
indeed, any quantitative concept of utility-for the analysis of riskless choices.
4 See Marshall, op. cit., p. 135 n.; Mathejnatical
Appendix, n. ix (p. 843). "Gambling involves an
economic loss, even when conducted on perfectly
fair and even terms.... A theoretically fair insurance against risks is always an economic gain" (p.
"The argument that fair gambling is an eco135).
nomic blunder. . . requires no further assumption
than that, firstly the pleasures of gambling may be
neglected; and, secondly e" (x) is negative for all
values of x, where , (x) is the pleasure derived from
wealth equal to x.... It is true that this loss of
probable happiness need not be greater than the
pleasure derived from the excitement of gambling,
and we are then thrown back upon the induction
that pleasures of gambling are in Bentham's phrase
'impure'; since experience shows that they are likely
to engender a restless, feverish character, unsuited
for steady work as well as for the higher and more
solid pleasures of life" (p. 843).

<-----Page 3----->THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

The shift from the kind of utility analysis employed by Marshall to the indifference-curve analysis of F. Y. Edgeworth, Irving Fisher, and Vilfredo Pareto revealed that to rationalize riskless
choices, it is sufficient to suppose that individuals can rank baskets of goods by
total utility. It is unnecessary to suppose
that they can compare differences between utilities. But diminishing, or increasing, marginal utility implies a comparison of differences between utilities
and hence is an entirely gratuitous assumption in interpreting riskless choices.
The idea that choices among alternatives involving risk can be explained by
the maximization of expected utility is
ancient, dating back at least to D. Bernoulli's celebrated analysis of the St.
Petersburg paradox.5 It has been repeatedly referred to since then but almost
invariably rejected as the correct explanation-commonly because the prevailing belief in diminishing marginal utility
made it appear that the existence of
gambling could not be so explained.
Even since the widespread recognition
that the assumption of diminishing mar5See Daniel Bernoulli, Versuch einer neuen
Tizeorieder Wertbestirnrnungvon Gliicksfdllen (Leipzig, i896), translated by A. Pringsheim from "Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis," Commentarii acaderniae scienliarum imperialis Petropolitanae, Vol. V, for the years I730 and I731,
published in I 738.
In an interesting note appended to his paper
Bernoulli points out that Cramer (presumably
Gabriel Cramer [I704-52]), a famous mathematician
of the time, had anticipated some of his own views
by a few years. The passages that he quotes from a
letter in French by Cramer contain what, to us, is
the truly essential point in Bernoulli's paper, namely, the idea of using the mathematical expectation
of utility (the "moral expectation") instead of
the mathematical expection of income to compare alternatives involving risk. Cramer has not
in general been attributed this much credit,
apparently because the essential point in Bernoulli's paper has been taken to be the suggestion
that the logarithm of income is an appropriate
utility function.

ginal utility is unnecessary to explain
riskless choices, writers have continued
to reject maximization of expected utility
as "unrealistic."6 This rejection of maximization of expected utility has been
challenged by John von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in their recent book,
Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.7
They argue that "under the conditions
on which the indifference curve analysis
is based very little extra effort is needed
to reach a numerical utility," the expected value of which is maximized in
choosing among alternatives involving
risk.8 The present paper is based on their
treatment but has been made self-contained by the paraphrasing of essential
parts of their argument.
If an individual shows by his market
6 "It has been the assumption in the classical
literature on this subject that the individual in
question will always try to maximize the matheThis
matical expectation of his gain or utility....
may appear plausible, but it is certainly not an assumption which must hold true in all cases. It has
been pointed out that the individual may also be
interested in, and influenced by, the range or the
standard deviation of the different possible utilities
derived or some other measure of dispersion. It appears pretty evident from the behavior of people in
lotteries or football pools that they are not a little
influenced by the skewness of the probability distribution" (Gerhard Tintner, "A Contribution to
the Non-Static Theory of Choice," QuarterlyJournal
of Economics, LVI [February, I942], 278).
"It would be definitely unrealistic ... to confine
ourselves to the mathematical expectation only,
which is the usual but not justifiable practice of the
traditional calculus of 'moral probabilities'" (J.
Marschak, "Money and the Theory of Assets,"
Econometrica, VI [1938], 320).
Tintner's inference, apparently also shared by
Marschak, that the facts he cites are necessarily inconsistent with maximization of expected utility is
erroneous (see secs. 3 and 4 below). He is led to
consider a formally more general solution because of
his failure to appreciate the real generality of the
kinds of behavior explicable by the maximization of
expected utility.

behaviorthat he prefersA to B and B to
C, it is traditional to rationalize this behavior by supposing that he attaches
more utility to A than to B and more
utility to B than to C. All utility functions that give the same ranking to possible alternatives will provide equally
good rationalizationsof such choices, and
it will make no differencewhich particular one is used. If, in addition, the individual should show by his market behavior that he prefers a 50-50 chance of

A or C to the certainty of B, it seems natural to rationalizethis behavior by supposing that the differencebetween the
utilities he attaches to A and B is greater
than the differencebetween the utilities
he attaches to B and C, so that the expectedutility of the preferred combination is greater than the utility of B. The
class of utility functions, if there be any,
that can provide the same rankingof alternatives that involve risk is much more
restrictedthan the class that can provide
the same rankingof alternatives that are
certain. It consists of utility functions
that differ only in origin and unit of
measure (i.e., the utility functions in the
class are linear functions of one another).9Thus, in effect, the ordinalproperties of utility functions can be used to
rationalizerisklesschoices, the numerical
properties to rationalize choices involving risk.

It does not, of course,follow that there
will exist a utility function that will rationalizein this way the reactionsof individuals to risk. It may be that individuals behave inconsistently-sometimes
choosinga 50-50chanceof A or C instead
of B and sometimesthe reverse;or sometimes choosingA instead of B, B instead
of C, and C instead of A or that in some
other way their behavior is different
from what it would be if they were seek9Ibid., pp. I5-3I,

ing rationally to maximize expected utility in accordance with a given utility
function. Or it may be that some types
of reactions to risk can be rationalized in
this way while others cannot. Whether
a numerical utility function will in fact
serve to rationalize any particular class
of reactions to risk is an empirical question to be tested; there is no obvious contradiction such as was once thought to
exist.
This paper attempts to provide a
crude empirical test by bringing together a few broad observations about
the behavior of individuals in choosing
among alternatives involving risk (sec. 2)
and investigating whether these observations are consistent with the hypothesis
revived by von Neumann and Morgenstern (secs. 3 and 4). It turns out that
these empirical observations are entirely
consistent with the hypothesis if a rather
special shape is given to the total utility
curve of money (sec. 4). This special
shape, which can be given a tolerably
satisfactory interpretation (sec. 5), not
only brings under the aegis of rational
utility maximization much behavior that
is ordinarily explained in other terms but
also has implications about observable
behavior not used in deriving it (sec. 6).
Further empirical work should make it
possible to determine whether or not
these implications conform to reality.
It is a testimony to the strength of the
belief in diminishing marginal utility
that it has taken so long for the possibility of interpreting gambling and similar
phenomena as a contradiction of universal diminishing marginal utility, rather
than of utility maximization, to be recognized. The initial mistake must have
been at least partly a product of a strong
introspective belief in diminishing marginal utility: a dollar must mean less to a
rich man than to a poor man; see how

<-----Page 5----->THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

much more a man will spend when he is
rich than when he is poor to avoid any
given amount of pain or discomfort.'I
Some of the comments that have been
published by competent economists on
the utility analysis of von Neumann and
Morgensternare even more remarkable
testimony to the hold that diminishing
marginalutility has on economists.Vickrey remarks: "There is abundant evidence that individual decisions in situations involvingrisk are not always made
in ways that are compatiblewith the assumptionthat the decisionsare made rationally with a view to maximizing the
mathematical expectation of a utility
function. The purchase of tickets in lotteries, sweepstakes,and 'numbers'pools
would imply, on such a basis, that the
marginalutility of money is an increasing
rather than a decreasing function of income. Such a conclusion is obviously
unacceptable as a guide to social policy."I"Kaysen remarks,"Unfortunately,
these postulates [underlying the von
Neumann and Morgensterndiscussionof
utility measurement]involve an assumption about economic behavior which is
contrary to experience.

. That this as-

10 This elemental argument seems so clearly to
justify diminishing marginal utility that it may be
desirable even now to state explicitly how this phenomenon can be rationalized equally well on the
assumption of increasing marginal utility of money.
It is only necessary to suppose that the avoidance of
pain and the other goods that can be bought with
money are related goods and that, while the marginal utility of money increases as the amount of
money increases, the marginal utility of avoiding
pain increases even faster.
"IWilliam Vickrey, "Measuring Marginal Utility
by Reactions to Risk," Econametrica, XIII (I945),

purchase of tickets in lotteries, sweepstakes, and
'numbers' pools" does not imply that marginal
utility of money increases with income everywhere
(see sec. 4 below). Moreover, it is entirely unnecessary to identify the quantity that individuals are
to be interpreted as maximizing with a quantity
that should be given special importance in public
policy.

sumption is contradicted by experience
can easily be shown by hundreds of examples [including] the participation of
individuals in lotteries in which their
mathematical expectation of gain (utility) is negative. 1I2
2. OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR TO BE
RATIONALIZED

The economicphenomenato whichthe
hypothesisrevived by von Neumann and
Morgenstern is relevant can be divided
into, first, the phenomena ordinarily regarded as gambling and insurance; second, other economic phenomena involving risk. The latter are clearly the more
important, and the ultimate significance

of the hypothesis will depend primarily
on the contributionit makes to an understanding of them. At the same time, the
influence of risk is revealed most markedly in gambling and insurance, so that
these phenomenahave a significancefor
testing and elaborating the hypothesis
out of proportion to their importance in

actual economic behavior.
At the outset it should be confessed
that we have conductedno extensive empirical investigation of either class of
phenomena.For the present, we are content to use what is already available in
the literature,or obvious from casual observation, to provide a first test of the
hypothesis and to impose significantsubstantive restrictionson it.
The majoreconomicdecisionsof an individual in which riskplays an important
role concern the employment of the resources he controls: what occupation to
follow, what entrepreneurialactivity to
engage in, how to invest (nonhuman)
capital. Alternative possible uses of resourcescan be classifiedinto three broad

groups according to the degree of risk involved: (a) those involving little or no
risk about the money return to be received-occupations like schoolteaching,
other civil service employment, clerical
work; business undertakings of a standard, predictable type like many public utilities; securities like government
bonds, high-grade industrial bonds; some
real property, particularly owner-occupied housing; (b) those involving a moderate degree of risk but unlikely to lead
to either extreme gains or extreme losses
-occupations like dentistry, accountancy, some kinds of managerial work;
business undertakings of fairly standard
kinds in which, however, there is sufficient competition to make the outcome
fairly uncertain; securities like lowergrade bonds, preferred stocks, highergrade common stocks; (c) those involving
much risk, with some possibility of extremely large gains and some of extremeinvolving
ly large losses-occupations
physical risks, like piloting aircraft, automobile racing, or professions like medicine and law; business undertakings in
untried fields; securities like highly
speculative stocks; some types of real
property.
The most significant generalization in
the literature about choices among these
three uses of resources is that, other
things the same, uses a or c tend in general to be preferred to use b; that is,
people must in general be paid a premium
to induce them to undertake moderate
risks instead of subjecting themselves to
either small or large risks. Thus Marshall
says: "There are many people of a sober
steady-going temper, who like to know
what is before them, and who would far
rather have an appointment which offered a certain income of say ?400 a year
than one which was not unlikely to yield
?6oo, but had an equal chance of afford-

ing only ?200. Uncertainty, therefore,
which does not appeal to great ambitions
and lofty aspirations, has special attractions for very few; while it acts as a deterrent to many of those who are making
their choice of a career. And as a rule the
certainty of moderate success attracts
more than an expectation of an uncertain
success that has an equal actuarial value.
"But on the other hand, if an occupation offers a few extremely high prizes, its
attractiveness is increased out of all proportion to their aggregate value."'3
Adam Smith comments similarly about
occupational choices and, in addition,
says of entrepreneurial undertakings:
"The ordinary rate of profits always
rises more or less with the risk. It does
not, however, seem to rise in proportion
to it, or so as to compensate it comThe presumptuous hope of
pletely....
success seems to act here as upon all
other occasions, and to entice so many
adventurers into those hazardous trades,
that their competition reduces the profit
below what is sufficient to compensate
the risk."'4
Edwin Cannan, in discussing the rate
of return on investments, concludes that
"the probability is that the classes of investments which on the average return
most to the investor are neither the very
safest of all nor the very riskiest, but the
intermediate classes which do not appeal
either to timidity or to the gambling
instinct."'5
This asserted preference for extremely
safe or extremely risky investments over

investments with an intermediate degree
of risk has its direct counterpart in the
willingness of persons to buy insurance
and also to buy lottery tickets or engage
in other forms of gambling involving a
small chance of a large gain. The extensive market for highly speculative stocks
-the kind of stocks that "blue-sky" laws
are intended to control-is a border-line
case that could equally well be designated as investment or gambling.
The empirical evidence for the willingness of persons of all income classes to
buy insurance is extensive.'6 Since insuri6 E.g., see U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Bulletin 648: Family Expenditures in Selected Cities,
I935-36, Vol. I: Family Expenditures for Housing,
I935-36; Vol. VI: Family Expenditures for Transportation, I935-36; and Vol. VIII: Changes in A ssets
and Liabilities, I935-36.
Table 6 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. I gives
the percentage of home-owning families reporting
the payment of premiums for insurance on the house.
These percentages are given separately for each income class in each of a number of cities or groups of
cities. Since premiums are often paid less frequently
than once a year, the percentages given definitely
understate the percentage of families carrying insurance. Yet the bulk of the percentages are well
over 40.
Table 5 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. VI gives
the percentage of families (again by income classes
and cities or groups of cities) reporting expenditures
for automobile insurance. These figures show a very
rapid increase in the percentage of automobile operators that had insurance (this figure is derived by
dividing the percentage of families reporting automobileinsurance by the percentage of families operating cars) as income increases. In the bottom income
classes, where operation of a car is infrequent, only
a minority of those who operate cars carry insurance.
In the upper income classes, where most families
operate cars, the majority of operators carry insurance. A convenient summary of these percentages
for selected income classes in six large cities, given
in text Table IO (p. 26), has forty-two entries. These
vary from 4 per cent to 98 per cent and twenty-three
are over 50 per cent.
Table 3 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. VIII
gives the percentage of families in each income class
in various cities or groups of cities reporting the
payment of life, endowment, or annuity insurance
premiums. The percentages are uniformly high. For
example, for New York City the percentage of white
families reporting the payment of insurance premiums is 75 per cent or higher for every income class

to over 95 per cent in the upper-income

classes; the percentage of Negro families purchasing

class

but 6o per cent or higher for every other class. This
story is repeated for city after city, the bulk of the
entries in the table for the percentage of families
purchasing insurance being above 8o per cent.
These figures cannot be regarded as direct estimates of the percentage of families willing to pay
something-that is, to accept a smaller actuarial
value-in order to escape risk, the technical meaning
of the purchase of insurance that is relevant for our
purpose. (i) The purchase of automobile and housing insurance may not be a matter of choice. Most
owned homes have mortgages (see I, 36i, Table L)
and the mortgage may require that insurance be
carried. The relevant figure for mortgaged homes
would be the fraction of owners carrying a larger
amount of insurance than is required by the mortgage. Similarly, finance companies generally require
that insurance be carried on automobiles purchased
on the instalment plan and not fully paid for, and
the purchase of automobile insurance is compulsory
in some states. (2) For automobile property damage
and liability insurance (but not collision insurance)
the risks to the operator and to the insurance company may not be the same, particularly to persons in
the lower-income classes. The loss to the uninsured
operator is limited by his wealth and borrowing
power, and the maximum amount that he can lose
may be well below the face value of the policy
that he would purchase. The excess of the premium
over the expected loss is thus greater for him than
for a person with more wealth or borrowing power.
The rise in the percentage of persons carrying
automobile insurance as income rises may therefore
reflect not an increased willingness to carry insurance but a reduction in the effective price that must
be paid for insurance. (3) This tendency may be reversed for the relatively high-income classes for both
automobile and housing insurance by the operation
of the income tax. Uninsured losses are in many instances deductible from income before computation
of income tax under the United States federal income tax, while insurance premiums are not. This
tends to make the net expected loss less for the
individual than for the insurance company. This
effect is almost certainly negligible for the figures
cited above, both because they do not effectively
cover very high incomes and because the federal income tax was relatively low in 1935-36.

losses against which he carries insurance.
That is, he is paying something to escape
risk.
The empirical evidence for the willingness of individuals to purchase lottery
tickets, or engage in similar forms of
gambling, is also extensive. Many governments find, and more governments
have found, lotteries an effective means
of raising revenue.t7 Though illegal, the
"numbers" game and similar forms of
gambling are reported to flourish in the

lower income classes.
choice of an uncertain alternative in preference to a
certain alternative with a higher expected value)
than to the payment of a premium to escape risk.
For example, special life-insurance policies purchased to cover a single railroad or airplane trip are
probably more nearly comparable to a lottery ticket
than a means of achieving certainty. (5) Even aside
from these qualifications, actual purchase of insurance would give at best a lower limit to the number
willing to buy insurance, since there will always be
some who will regard the price asked as too high.
These qualifications offset one another to some
extent. It seems highly unlikely that their net effect
could be sufficient to reverse the conclusion suggested by the evidence cited that a large fraction of
people in all income classes are willing to buy insurance.
I7 France, Spain, and Mexico, to name but three
examples, currently conduct lotteries for revenue.
Russia attaches a lottery feature to bonds sold to the
public. Great Britain conducted lotteries from i694
to i826. In the United States lotteries were used
extensively before the Revolution and for some time
thereafter, both directly by state governments and
under state charters granted to further specific
projects deemed to have a state interest. For the history of lotteries in Great Britain see C. L'Estrange
Ewen, Lotteries and Sweepstakes (London, 1932);
in
New York State, A. F. Ross, "History of Lotteries in
New York," Magazine of History, Vol. V (New York,
1907).

There seem to be no direct estimates of the

fraction of the people who purchase tickets in state
or other legal lotteries, and it is clear that such
figures would be difficult to get from data obtained
in connection with running the lotteries. The receipts
from legal lotteries, and casual impressions of observers, suggest that a substantial fraction of the
relevant units (families or, alternatively, individual
income recipients) purchase tickets.
I8
Evidence from wagering on horse races, where
this has been legalized, is too ambiguous to be of

It seems highly unlikely that there is a
sharp dichotomy between the individuals
who purchase insurance and those who
gamble. It seems much more likely that
many do both or, at any rate, would be
willing to. We can cite no direct evidence
for this asserted fact, though indirect evidence and casual observation give us considerable confidence that it is correct. Its
validity is suggested by the extensiveness
of both gambling and the purchase of insurance. It is also suggested by some of
the available evidence on how people invest their funds. The widespread legislation against "bucket shops" suggests
that relatively poor people must have
been willing to buy extremely speculative
stocks of a "blue-sky" variety. Yet the
bulk of the property income of the lowerincome classes consists of interest and
rents and relatively little of dividends,
whereas the reverse is true for the upperincome classes.'9 Rents and interest are
types of receipts that tend to be derived
from investments with relatively little
risk, and so correspond to the purchase
of insurance, whereas investment in speculative stocks corresponds to the purchase of lottery tickets.
Offhand it appears inconsistent for the
same person both to buy insurance and
to gamble: he is willing to pay a premium, in the one case, to avoid risk, in
the other, to bear risk. And indeed it
would be inconsistent for a person to be

willing to pay something (no matter how
little) in excess of actuarial value to
avoid every possible risk and also something in excess of actuarial value to assume every possible risk. One must distinguish among different kinds of insurance and different kinds of gambling,
since a willingness to pay something for
only some kinds of insurance would not
necessarily be inconsistent with a willingness to engage in only some kinds of
gambling. Unfortunately, very little empirical evidence is readily available on
the kinds of insurance that people are
willing to buy and the kinds of gambling
that they are willing to engage in. About
the only clear indication is that people
are willing to enter into gambles that
offer a small chance of a large gain-as in
lotteries and "blue-sky" securities.
Lotteries seem to be an extremely
fruitful, and much neglected, source of
information about reactions of individuals to risk. They present risk in relatively pure form, with little admixture of
other factors; they have been conducted
in many countries and for many centuries, so that a great deal of evidence is
available about them; there has been extensive experimentation with the terms
and conditions that would make them
attractive, and much competition in conducting them, so that any regularities
they may show would have to be interpreted as reflecting corresponding regularities in human behavior.20 It is, of
course, not certain that inferences from
20
Aside from their value in providing information
about reactions to risk, data from lotteries may be of
broader interest in providing evidence about the
stability of tastes and preferences over time and
their similarity in different parts of the world. Here
is a "commodity" which has remained unchanged
over centuries, which is the same all over the globe,
and which has been dealt in widely for the entire
period and over much of the globe. It is hard to conceive of any other commodity for which this is
true.

287

lotteries would carry over to other
choices involving risk. There would, however, seem to be some presumption that
they would do so, though of course the
validity of this presumption would have
to be tested.21
The one general feature of lotteries
that is worth noting in this preliminary
survey, in addition to the general willingness of people to participate in them, is
the structure of prizes that seems to have
developed. Lotteries rarely have just a
single prize equal to the total sum to be
paid out as prizes. Instead, they tend to
have several or many prizes. The largest
prize is ordinarily not very much larger
than the next largest, and often there is
not one largest prize but several of the
same size.22 This tendency is so general
that one would expect it to reflect some
consistent feature of individual reactions, and any hypothesis designed to
explain reactions to uncertainty should
explain it.
3. THE FORMAL HYPOTHESIS

The hypothesis that is proposed for
rationalizing the behavior just summarized can be stated compactly as follows:
In choosing among alternatives open to
it, whether or not these alternatives involve risk, a consumer unit (generally a
family, sometimes an individual) behaves as if (a) it had a consistent set of
preferences; (b) these preferences could
be completely described by a function
attaching a numerical value-to be desalternatives each
ignated "utility"-to
of which is regarded as certain; (c) its
objective were to make its expected util21

ity as large as possible. It is the contribution of von Neumann and Morgenstern
to have shown that an alternative statement of the same hypothesis is: An individual chooses in accordance with a system of preferences which has the following properties:
The system is complete and consistent; that
is, an individual can tell which of two objects
he prefers or whether he is indifferent between them, and if he does not prefer C to B
and does not prefer B to A, then he does not
prefer C to A.23 (In this context, the word
"object" includes combinations of objects
with stated probabilities; for example, if A
and B are objects, a 40-60 chance of A or B
is also an object.)
2. Anv object which is a combination of other
objects with stated probabilities is never preferred to every one of these other objects,
nor is every one of them ever preferredto the
combination.
3. If the object A is preferred to the object B
and B to the object C, there will be some
probability combination of A and C such
that the individual is indifferent between it
and B.24
i.

This form of statement is designed to
show that there is little difference be23 The transitivity of the relation of indifference
assumed in this postulate is, of course, an idealization. It is clearly possible that the difference between
successive pairs of alternatives in a series might be
imperceptible to an individual, yet the first of the
series definitely preferable to the last. This idealization, which is but a special case of the idealization
involved in the geometric concept of a dimensionless
point, seems to us unobjectionable. However, the use
of this idealization in indifference-curve analysis is
the major criticism offered by W. E. Armstrong in an
attack on indifference-curve analysis in his article
"The Determinateness of the Utility Function,"
Economic Journal, XLIX (September, I939), 45367. In a more recent article ("Uncertainty and the
Utility Function," Economic Journal, LVIII
i-io) Armstrong repeats this
[March, I948],
criticism and adds to it the criticism that choices involving risk cannot be rationalized by the ordinal
properties of utility functions.

equivalent see von Neumann and Morgenstern,
op. cit., pp. 26-27, 6I7-32.

tween the plausibility of this hypothesis
and the usual indifference-curve explanation of riskless choices.
These statements of the hypothesis
conceal by their very compactness most of
its implications. It will pay us, therefore,
to elaborate them. It simplifies matters,
and involves no loss in generality, to regard the alternatives open to the consumer unit as capable of being expressed
entirely in terms of money or money income. Actual alternatives are not, of
course, capable of being so expressed: the
same money income may be valued very
differently according to the terms under
which it is to be received, the nonpecuniary advantages or disadvantages
associated with it, and so on. We can abstract from these factors, which play no
role in the present problem, by supposing
either that they are the same for different
incomes compared or that they can be
converted into equivalent sums of money
income.25This permits us to consider total utility a function of money income
alone.
Let I represent the income of a consumer unit per unit time, and U(I) the
utility attached to that income if it is
regarded as certain. Measure I along the
horizontal axis of a graph and U along
the vertical. In general, U(I) will not be
defined for all values of I, since there will
be a lower limit to the income a consumer
unit can receive, namely, a negative in25 The other factors abstracted from must not,
of course, include any that cannot in fact be held
constant while money income varies. For example, a
higher income is desired because it enables a consumer unit to purchase a wider variety of commodities. The consumption pattern of the consumer
unit must not therefore be supposed to be the same
at different incomes. As another example, a higher
income may mean that a consumer unit must pay
a higher price for a particular commodity (e.g.,
medical service). Such variation in price should
not be impounded in celeris paribus, though price
changes not necessarily associated with changes in
the consumer unit's income should be.

<-----Page 11----->THE UTILITY ANALYSISOF CHOICESINVOLVINGRISK

come equal (in absolute value) to the
maximum amount that the consumer
unit can lose per unit time for the period
to which the utility curve refers.
Alternatives open to the consumer
unit that involve no risk consist of posThe hysible incomes, say I', I"....
pothesis then implies simply that the
consumerunit will choose the income to
which it attaches the most utility. Other
things the same, we know from even
casual observation that the consumer
unit will in general choose the largest income: put differently, we consider it
pathologicalfor an individualliterally to
throw money away, yet this means of
choosing a smaller income is always
available. It follows that the hypothesis
can rationalizerisklesschoicesof the limited kind consideredhere if, and only if,
the utility of money income is larger, the
higherthe income. Considerationof riskless choices imposes no further requirements on the utility function.
Alternatives involving risk consist of
probability distributions of possible incomes. Fortunately, it will sufficefor our
purpose to consider only a particularly
simple kind of alternative involving risk,
namely (A) a chance a(o < a < i) of an
income II, and a chance (i - a) of an
income I2, where for simplicity 12 is sup-

posed always greater than II. This simplificationis possiblebecause, as we shall
see later, the original hypothesis implies
that choices of consumer units among
morecomplicatedalternativescanbe predicted from complete knowledge of their
preferences among alternatives like A
and a riskless alternative (B) consisting
of a certain income Io.

Since "other things" are supposed the
same for alternativesA and B, the utility
of the two alternatives may be taken to
be functions solely of the incomes and
probabilitiesinvolved and not also of at-

289

tendant circumstances. The utility of
alternative B is U(Io). The expected
utility of A is given by

U (A) = a U (I) + ( 1-a)U

(I2)

Accordingto the hypothesis, a consumer
unit will choose A if U > U(Io), will
choose B if U < U(I), and will be indifferent between A and B if U = U(Io).
Let I(A) be the actuarial value of A,
i.e., I(A) = aI + (i - a)I2. If I. is
equal to I, the "gamble"or "insurance"
is said to be "fair" since the consumer
unit gets the same actuarialvalue whichever alternative it chooses. If, under
these circumstances, the consumer unit
chooses A, it shows a preferencefor this
risk. This is to be interpretedas meaning
that U > U(I) and indeed U - U(I)
may be taken to measure the utility it
attaches to this particular risk.26 If the

consumerunit choosesB, it shows a preference for certainty. This is to be interpreted as meaning that U < U(I). Indifferencebetween A and B is to be interpreted as meaning that U = U(I).
Let I* be the certain income that has
the same utility as A, that is, U(I*) =
U.27 Call I* the income equivalent to A.
The requirement,derived from consider26 This interpretation of U U(I) as the utility
attached to a particular risk is directly relevant to a
point to which von Neumann and Morgenstern and
commentators on their work have given a good deal
of attention, namely, whether there may "not exist
in an individual a (positive or negative) utility of the
mere act of 'taking a chance,' of gambling, which
the use of the mathematical expectation obliterates"
(von Neumann and Morgenstern, op. cit., p. 28). In
our view the hypothesis is better interpreted as a
rather special explanation why gambling has utility
or disutility to a consumer unit, and as providing a
particular measure of the utility or disutility, than
as a denial that gambling has utility (see ibid., pp.

28, 629-32).
27 Since U has been assumed strictly monotonic
to rationalize riskless choices, there will be only one
income, if any, that has the same utility as A. There
will be one if U is continuous which, for simplicity,
we assume to be the case throughout this paper.

because,while it is willing to pay a price
for certainty, it is being asked to pay
more than the maximum amount (I I*) that it is willing to pay. The price of
insurancehas become so high that it has,
as it were, been converted into a seller
rather than a buyer of insurance.

buying insurance is to be regarded as
having a current income of 12 and as
being subject to a chance of losing a sum
equal to 12 - I, so that if this loss should
occur its income would be reduced to II.
It can insure against this loss by paying
a premium equal to 12 - 10. The premium, in general, will be larger than
12-I,
the "loading" being equal to

Purchase of insurance therefore

means accepting the certainty of an income equal to Io instead of a pair of alternative incomes having a higher expected value. Similarly, a consumerunit

unit's preferences among alternatives involving risk can be indicated most easily
by describing a conceptual experiment
for determining the utility function.
Select any two incomes, say $5oo and
$Iooo. Assign any arbitrary utilities to
these incomes, say o utiles and i utile, respectively. This corresponds to an arbitrary choice of origin and unit of measure. Select any intermediate income, say
$6oo. Offer the consumer unit the choice
between (A) a chance a of $5oo and
a) of $iooo or (B) a certainty of
(I$6oo, varying a until the consumer unit
is indifferent between the two (i.e., until
I* = $6oo). Suppose this indifference
value of a is j. If the hypothesis is correct, it follows that

In this way the utility attached to every

determined. To get the utility attached

say $io,ooo,

offer the con-

sumer unit a choice between (A) a chance

consumer unit is indifferent between the
two (i.e., until * = $ioo).

In principle, the possibility of carrying
out this experiment, and the reproducibility of the results, would provide a test
of the hypothesis. For example, the con-

sistency of behavior assumed by the hypothesis would be contradictedif a repetition of the experiment using two initial
incomes other than $5oo and $i,ooo
yielded a utility function differing in
more than origin and unit of measure
from the one initially obtained.
Given a utility function obtained in
this way, it is possible, if the hypothesis
is correct, to compute the utility attached to (that is, the expected utility of)
any set or sets of possible incomes and
associated probabilities and thereby to
predict which of a number of such sets
will be chosen. This is the precise meaning of the statement made toward the
beginning of this section that, if the hypothesis were correct, complete knowledge of the preferencesof consumerunits
among alternatives like A and B would
make it possibleto predict their reactions
to any other choices involving risk.
The choices a consumer unit makes
that involve risk are typically far more
complicated than the simple choice between A and B that we have used to
elaborate the hypothesis. There are two
chief sources of complication: Any particular alternative typically offers an indefinitely large number of possible incomes, and "other things" are generally
not the same.
The multiplicity of possible incomes is
very general: losses insured against ordinarily have more than one possible
value; lotteries ordinarily have more
than one prize; the possible income from
a particular occupation, investment, or
business enterprisemay be equal to any
of an indefinitelylarge numberof values.
A hypothesis that the essence of choices
among the degrees of risk involved in
such complexalternativesis containedin
such simple choices as the choice between A and B is by no means tautological.

<-----Page 15----->THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

The hypothesis does not, of course,
pretend to say anything about how consumer choices will be affected by differences in things other than degree of risk.
The significance for our purposes of such
differences is rather that they greatly increase the difficulty of getting evidence
about reactions to differences in risk
alone. Much casual experience, particularly experience bearing on what is ordinarily regarded as gambling, is likely to
be misinterpreted, and erroneously regarded as contradictory to the hypothesis, if this difficulty is not explicitly recognized. In much so-called gambling the
individual chooses not only to bear risk
but also to participate in the mechanics
of a game of chance; he buys, that is, a
gamble, in our technical sense, and entertainment. We can conceive of separating
these two commodities: he could buy entertainment alone by paying admission
to participate in a game using valueless
chips; he could buy the gamble alone by
having an agent play the game of chance
for him according to detailed instructions.28 Further, insurance and gambles
are often purchased in almost pure form.
This is notably true of insurance. It is
true also of gambling by the purchase of
lottery tickets when the purchaser is not
a spectator to the drawing of the winners
(e.g., Irish sweepstakes tickets bought in
this country or the "numbers" game),
and of much stock-market speculation.
An example of behavior that would
definitely contradict the assertion, contained in the hypothesis, that the same
utility function can be used to explain
choices that do and do not involve risk
28 It does not, of course, follow that the price an
individual is willing to pay for the joint commodity
is simply the sum of the prices he is willing to pay
for them separately. Indeed, it may well be the possible existence of such a difference that people have
in mind when they speak of a "specific utility of
gambling."

293

would be willingness by an indiviual to
pay more for a gamble than the maximum amount he could win. In order to
explain riskless choices it is necessary to
suppose that utility increases with income. It follows that the average utility
of two incomescan never exceed the utility of the larger income and hence that
an individualwill never be willing to pay,
for example, a dollar for a chanceof winning, at most, 99 cents.
More subtle observation would be required to contradict the assertion that
the reactions of persons to complicated
gambles can be inferred from their reactions to simple gambles. For example,
suppose an individual refuses an opportunity to toss a coin for a dollar and also
to toss a coin for two dollars but then
accepts an opportunity to toss two coins
in succession, the first to determine
whether the second toss is to be for one
dollar or for two dollars. This behavior
would definitely contradict the hypothesis. On the hypothesis, the utility of the
third gamble is an average of the utility
of the first two. His refusal of the first
two indicates that each of them has a
lower utility than the alternative of not
gambling; hence, if the hypothesis were
correct, the third should have a lower
utility than the same alternative, and he
should refuse it.
4. RESTRICTIONS ON UTILITY FUNCTION
REQUIRED TO RATIONALIZE
OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR

The one restriction imposed on the
utility function in the preceding section
is that total utility increase with the
size of money income. This restriction
was imposedto rationalizethe first of the
facts listed below. We are now ready to
see whether the behavior described in
section 2 can be nartioalizedby the hy-

<-----Page 16----->294

MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE

pothesis, and, if so, what additional restrictions this behavior imposes on the
utility function. To simplify the task, we
shall take as a summary of the essential
features of the behavior described in section 2 the following five statements, alleged to be facts: (i) consumer units prefer larger to smaller certain incomes;
(2)
low-income consumer units buy, or
are willing to buy, insurance; (3) lowincome consumer units buy, or are willing
to buy, lottery tickets; (4) many lowincome consumer units buy, or are willing to buy, both insurance and lottery
tickets; (5) lotteries typically have more
than one prize.
These particular statements are selected not because they are the most important in and of themselves but because
they are convenient to handle and the restrictions imposed to rationalize them
turn out to be sufficient to rationalize all
the behavior described in section 2.
It is obvious from Figure i and our discussion of it that if the utility function
were everywhere convex from above (for
utility functions with a continuous derivative, if the marginal utility of money
does not increase for any income), the
consumer unit, on our hypothesis, would
be willing to enter into any fair insurance plan but would be unwilling to pay
anything in excess of the actuarial value
for any gamble. If the utility function
were everywhere concave from above
(for functions with a continuous derivative, if the marginal utility of money
does not diminish for any income), the
consumer unit would be willing to enter
into any fair gamble but would be unwilling to pay anything in excess of the
actuarial value for insurance against any
risk.
It follows that our hypothesis can rationalize statement 2, the purchase of insurance by low-income consumer units,

only if the utility functions of the corresponding units are not everywhere concave from above; that it can rationalize
statement 3, the purchase of lottery tickets by low-income consumer units, only
if the utility functions of the corresponding units are not everywhere convex
from above; and that it can rationalize
statement 4, the purchase of both insurance and lottery tickets by low-income
consumer units, only if the utility functions of the corresponding units are
neither everywhere concave from above
nor everywhere convex from above.
The simplest utility function (with a
continuous derivative) that can rationalize all three statements simultaneously is
one that has a segment convex from
above followed by a segment concave
from above and no other segments.29 The
convex segment must precede the concave segment because of the kind of insurance and of gambling the low-income
consumer units are said to engage in: a
chord from the existing income to a lower
income must be below the utility function to rationalize the purchase of insurance against the risk of loss; a chord
from the immediate neighborhood of the
existing income to a higher income must
be above the utility function at the existing income to rationalize the purchase
for a small sum of a small chance of a
large gain.30
Figure 2 illustrates a utility function
satisfying these requirements. Let this
utility function be for a low-income con29 A kink or a
jump in the utility function could
rationalize either the gambling or the insurance. For
example, the utility function could be composed of
two convex or two concave segments joined in a
kink. There is no essential loss in generality in
neglecting such cases, as we shall do from here on,
since one can always think of rounding the kink ever
so slightly.
30 If there are more than two segments and a continuous derivative, a convex segment necessarily
precedes a concave segment.

stead of using observations about the behavior of relatively high-income consumer units, we shall seek to learn more
about the upper end of the curve by
using statement 5, the tendency for lotteries to have more than one prize.
In order to determine the implications
of this statement for the utility function,
we must investigate briefly the economics of lotteries. Consider an entrepreneur
conducting a lottery and seeking to maximize his income from it. For simplicity,
suppose that he conducts the lottery by
deciding in advance the number of tickets to offer and then auctioning them off
at the highest price he can get.33 Aside
from advertising and the like, the variables at his disposal are the terms of the
lottery: the number of tickets to sell, the
total amount to offer as prizes (which together, of course, determine the actuarial
value of a ticket), and the structure of
prizes to offer. For any given values of
premium to the consumer unit is less than the
premium received by the insurance company. Similarly, gambling gains in excess of gambling losses are
taxable under the federal income tax, while gambling losses in excess of gambling gains are not deductible. The special treatment of capital gains and
losses under the existing United States federal income tax adds still further complications.
Even if both the premium and the uninsured loss
are deductible, or a gain taxable and the corresponding loss deductible, the income tax may change the
terms because of the progressive rates. The taxsaving from a large loss may be a smaller fraction of
the loss than the tax payable on the gain is of the
gain.
These comments clearly apply not only to insurance and gambling proper but also to other economic decisions involving risk-the purchase of
securities, choice of occupation or business, etc. The
neglect of these considerations has frequently led to
the erroneous belief that a progressive income tax
does not affect the allocation of resources and is in
this way fundamentally different from excise taxes.
33 This was, in fact, the way in which the British
government conducted many of its official lotteries.
It frequently auctioned off the tickets to lottery
dealers, who served as the means of distributing the
tickets to the public (see Ewen, op. cit., pp. 234-40).

the first two, the optimum structure of
prizes is clearly that which maximizes the
price he can get per ticket or, what is the
same thing, the excess of the price of a
ticket over its actuarial value-the "loading" per ticket.
In the discussion of Figure 2, it was
noted that I* - I was the maximum
amount in excess of the actuarial value
that the corresponding consumer unit
would pay for a gamble involving a
chance (i - a) of winning I2- I* and a
chance a of losing I* - II. This gamble
is equivalent to a lottery offering a chance
(i - a) of a prize I2 - II in return for
the purchase of a ticket at a price of
I* - II, the chance of winning the prize
being such that I - I1 is the actuarial
worth of a ticket (i.e., is equal to [i - a]
X [2- II]). If the consumer unit won the
prize, its net winnings would be I2 - *,
since it would have to subtract the cost
of the ticket from the gross prize. The
problem of the entrepreneur, then, is to
choose the structure of prizes that will
maximize I* - I for a given actuarial
value of a ticket, that is, for a given value
of I - II. Changes in the structure of
prizes involve changes in I2 - II. If
there is a single prize, I2II is equal to
the total amount to be distributed
a] is equal to the reciprocal of the
(Inumber of tickets). If there are two equal
prizes, I2 - II is cut in half ([i - a] is
then equal to twice the reciprocal of the
number of tickets). Suppose Figure 2 referred to this latter situation in which
there were two equal prizes, I* on the
diagram designating both the current income of the consumer unit and the income equivalent to the lottery. If the
price and actuarial worth of the ticket
were kept unchanged, but a single prize
was substituted for the two prizes (and
[i - a] correspondingly reduced), the
gamble would clearly become more at-

<-----Page 19----->THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

tractive to the consumer unit. I2 would
move to the right, the chord connecting
U(I) and U(I2) would rotate upward, U
would increase, and the consumer unit
would be paying less than the maximum
amount it was willing to pay. The price
of the ticket could accordingly be increased; that is, 12, I, and II could be
moved to the left until the I* for the new
gamble were equal to the consumer unit's
current income (the I* for the old
gamble). The optimum structure of
prizes clearly consists therefore of a
single prize, since this makes 12 - I, as
large as possible.
Statement 5, that lotteries typically
have more than one prize, is therefore inconsistent with the utility function of
Figure 2. This additional fact can be rationalized by terminating the utility
curve with a suitable convex segment.
This yields a utility curve like that drawn
in Figure 3. With such a utility curve,
1* - I would be a maximum at the point
at which a chord from U(I1) was tangent
to the utility curve, and a larger prize
would yield a smaller value of I*-I.34
A utility curve like that drawn in Fig34 An additional convex segment guarantees that
there will always exist current incomes of the consumer unit for which (a) attractive gambles exist and
(b) the optimum prize for attractive gambles has a
maximum. It does not guarantee that b will be true
for every income for which attractive gambles exist.
The condition on the current income that attractive
gambles exist is that the tangent to the utility
curve at the current income be below the utility
curve for some income (this argument, like many in
later technical footnotes, holds not only for the
utility function of Fig. 3 but for any differentiable
utility function). A single prize will be the optimum,
no matter what the amount distributed in prizes or
the fixed actuarial worth of the prize if, and only if,
every chord from the utility curve at the current income to the utility of a higher income is everywhere
above the utility curve. A particular, and somewhat
interesting, class of utility functions for which b will
be true for every income for which a is true is the
class for which utility approaches a finite limit as
income increases.

ure 3 is the simplest one consistent with
the five statements listed at the outset of
this section.
5. A DIGRESSION

It seems well to digressat this point to
consider two questions that, while not
strictly relevant to our main theme, are
likely to occur to many readers:first, is
not the hypothesis patently unrealistic;
second, can any plausible interpretation
be given to the rather peculiar utility
function of Figure 3?
UTILITY (U)

curve.

a) THE DESCRIPTIVE "REALISM" OF
THE HYPOTHESIS

An objection to the hypothesis just
presented that is likely to be raised by
many, if not most, readersis that it conflicts with the way human beings actually behave and choose. Is it not patently unrealisticto supposethat individuals consult a wiggly utility curve before
gambling or buying insurance,that they
know the odds involved in the gamblesor
insuranceplans open to them, that they
can compute the expected utility of a
gamble or insuranceplan, and that they
base their decision on the size of the
expected utility?
While entirely natural and understandable, this objection is not strictly

<-----Page 20----->298

MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE

relevant. The hypothesis does not assert
that individualsexplicitly or consciously
calculate and compareexpected utilities.
Indeed, it is not at all clear what such an
assertion would mean or how it could be
tested. The hypothesis asserts rather
that, in makinga particularclass of decisions, individuals behave as if they cal-

culated and compared expected utility
and as if they knew the odds. The valid-

ity of this assertion does not depend on
whether individuals know the precise
odds, muchless on whetherthey say that
they calculate and compare expected
utilities or think that they do, or whether
it appears to others that they do, or
whether psychologists can uncover any
evidence that they do, but solely on
whether it yields sufficiently accurate
predictions about the class of decisions
with which the hypothesis deals. Stated
differently,the test by results is the only
possible method of determiningwhether
the as if statement is or is not a suffi-

ciently good approximationto reality for
the purpose at hand.
A simple example may help to clarify
the point at issue. Considerthe problem
of predicting,beforeeach shot, the direction of travel of a billiard ball hit by an
expert billiard player. It would be possible to construct one or more mathematical formulasthat would give the directionsof travel that would scorepoints
and, amongthese, wouldindicate the one
(or more) that would leave the balls in
the best positions. The formulas might,
of course, be extremely complicated,
since they would necessarily take account of the location of the balls in relation to one another and to the cushions
and of the complicated phenomena introduced by "english." Nonetheless, it
seems not at all unreasonablethat excellent predictionswould be yielded by the
hypothesis that the billiardplayer made

his shots as if he knew the formulas,
could estimate accurately by eye the
angles, etc., describingthe location of the
balls, could make lightning calculations
from the formulas,and could then make
the ball travel in the direction indicated
by the formulas. It would in no way disprove or contradict the hypothesis, or
weaken our confidencein it, if it should
turn out that the billiard player had
never studiedany branchof mathematics
and was utterly incapableof making the
necessary calculations:unless he was capable in some way of reaching approximately the same result as that obtained
from the formulas, he would not in fact
be likely to be an expert billiard player.
The same considerationsare relevant
to our utility hypothesis. Whatever the
psychological mechanism whereby individuals make choices, these choices appear to display some consistency, which
can apparently be describedby our utility hypothesis. This hypothesis enables
predictionsto be made about phenomena
on which there is not yet reliable evidence. The hypothesis cannot be declared invalid for a particularclass of behavior until a predictionabout that class
proves false. No other test of its validity
is decisive.
b)

A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF
THE UTILITY FUNCTION

A possible interpretationof the utility
function of Figure 3 is to regardthe two
convex segments as corresponding to
qualitatively different socioeconomic
levels, and the concave segment to the
transitionbetween the two levels. On this
interpretation, increases in income that
raise the relative position of the consumer unit in its own class but do not
shift the unit out of its class yield diminishing marginal utility, while increasesthat shift it into a new class, that

<-----Page 21----->THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

give it a new social and economicstatus,
yield increasing marginal utility. An
unskilled worker may prefer the certainty of an income about the same as
that of the majority of unskilledworkers
to an actuariallyfair gamble that at best
would make him one of the most prosperous unskilled workers and at worst
one of the least prosperous.Yet he may
jump at an actuarially fair gamble that
offersa small chanceof lifting him out of
the class of unskilled workers and into
the "middle" or "upper" class, even
though it is far morelikely than the preceding gamble to make him one of the
least prosperousunskilled workers. Men
will and do take great risks to distinguish
themselves, even when they know what
the risks are. May not the concave segment of the utility curve of Figure 3
translate the economic counterpart of
this phenomenonappropriately?
A numberof additionsto the hypothesis are suggested by this interpretation.
In the first place, may there not be more
than two qualitatively distinguishable
socioeconomicclasses? If so, might not
each be reflectedby a convex segment in
the utility function? At the moment,
there seems to be no observed behavior
that requires the introduction of additional convex segments,so it seems undesirable and unnecessary to complicate
the hypothesis further. It may well be,
however,that it will be necessaryto add
such segments to account for behavior
revealed by further empirical evidence.
In the secondplace, if differentsegments
of the curve correspondto differentsocioeconomicclasses, should not the dividing
points between the segments occur at
roughly the same income for different
consumerunits in the same community?
If they did, the fruitfulness of the hypothesis would be greatly extended. Not
only couldthe generalshapeof the utility

299

function be supposed typical; so also
could the actual income separating the
various segments. The initial convex segment could be described as applicable to
"relatively low-income consumer units"
and the terminal convex segment as applicable to "relatively high-income consumer units"; and the groups so designated could be identified by the actual
income or wealth of different consumer
units.
Interpreting the different segments of
the curve as corresponding to different
socioeconomic classes would, of course,
still permit wide variation among consumer units in the exact shape and height
of the curve. In addition, it would not be
necessary to suppose anything more than
rough similarity in the location of the
incomes separating the various segments.
Different socioeconomic classes are not
sharply demarcated from one another;
each merges into the next by imperceptible gradations (which, of course, accounts for the income range encompassed
by the concave segment); and the generally accepted dividing line between
classes will vary from time to time, place
to place, and consumer unit to consumer
unit. Finally, it is not necessary that
every consumer unit have a utility curve
like that in Figure 3. Some may be inveterate gamblers; others, inveterately
cautious. It is enough that many consumer units have such a utility curve.
6. FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF HYPOTHESIS

To return to our main theme, we have
two tasks yet to perform: first, to show
that the utility function of Figure 3 is
consistent with those features of the behavior described in section 2 not used in
deriving it; second, to suggest additional
implications of the hypothesis capable of
providing a test of it.
The chief generalization of section 2

<-----Page 22----->300

MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE

not so far used is that people must in general be paid a premium to induce them to
bear moderate risks instead of either
small or large risks. Is this generalization
consistent with the utility function of
Figure 3?
It clearly is for a consumer unit whose
income places it in the initial convex segment. Such a relatively low-income consumer unit will be willing to pay something more than the actuarial value for
insurance against any kind of risk that
may arise; it will be averse to small fair
gambles; it may be averse to all fair
gambles; if not, it will be attracted by
fair gambles that offer a small chance of a
large gain; the attractiveness of such
gambles, with a given possible loss and
actuarial value, will initially increase as
the size of the possible gain increases and
will eventually decrease.35 Such conThe willingness of a consumer unit in the
initial convex segment to pay something more than
the actuarial value for insurance against any kind
of risk follows from the fact that a chord connecting
the utility of its current income with the utility of
any lower income to which it might be reduced by
the risk in question will everywhere be below the
utility curve. The expected utility is therefore less
than the utility of the expected income.
To analyze the reaction of such a consumer unit
to different gambles, consider the limiting case in
which the gamble is fair, i.e., I = 10. I then is both
the expected income of the consumer unit if it takes
the gamble and its actual income if it does not (i.e.,
its current income). The possible gains (and associated probabilities) that will be attractive to the unit
for a given value of I. (i.e., a given possible loss)
can be determined by drawing a straight line
through U(11) and U(I). All values of I2 > I for
which U(I,) is greater than the ordinate of the extended straight line will be attractive; no others
will be.
Since I is assumed to be in the first convex segment, there will always exist some values of I2 > I
for which U(I2) is less than the ordinate of the
extended straight line. This is the basis for the statement that the consumer unit will be averse to small
gambles.
Consider the line that touches the curve at only
two points and is nowhere below the utility curve.
Call the income at the first of the points at which
it touches the curve, which may be the lowest possible income, 1', and the income at the second
35

sumer units therefore prefer either certainty or a risk that offers a small chance
of a large gain to a risk that offers the
possibility of moderate gains or losses.
They will therefore have to be paid a
premium to induce them to undertake
such moderate risks.
The generalization is clearly false for a
consumer unit whose income places it in
the concave segment. Such an "intermediate-income" consumer unit will be
attracted by every small fair gamble; it
may be attracted by every fair gamble; it
may be averse to all fair insurance; if
not, it will be attracted by insurance
against relatively large losses.36 Such consumer units will therefore be willing to
pay a premium in order to assume moderate risks.
point, I". The consumer unit will be averse to all
gambles if its income (I = I) is equal to or less
than I'. This follows from the fact that a tangent to
the curve at I will then be steeper than the "double
tangent" and will intersect the latter prior to I';
a chord from I to a lower income will be even steeper.
This is the basis for the statement that the consumer
unit may be averse to all gambles.
If the income is above I', there will always be
some attractive gambles. These will offer a small
chance of a large gain. The statement about the
changing attractiveness of the gamble as the size of
the possible gain changes follows from the analysis
in sec. 4 of the conditions under which it would be
advantageous to have a single prize in a lottery.
36 Consider the tangent to the utility curve at the
income the consumer unit would have if it did not
take the gamble (I = I.). If this income is in the
concave section, the tangent will be below the utility curve at least for an interval of incomes surrounding I. A chord connecting any two points of
the utility curve on opposite sides of I and within
this interval will always be above the utility curve
at I (i.e., the expected utility will be above the
utility of the expected income), so these gambles
will be attractive. The tangent may lie below the
utility curve for all incomes. In this case, every fair
gamble will be attractive. The unit will be averse to
insuring against a loss, whatever the chance of its
occurring, if a chord from the current income to the
lower income to which it would be reduced by the
loss is everywhere above the utility curve. This will
surely be true for small losses and may be true for
all possible losses.

<-----Page 23----->THE UTILITY ANALYSISOF CHOICESINVOLVINGRISK
The generalization is partly true,
partly false, for a consumer unit whose
income places it in the terminal convex
segment. Such a relatively high-income
consumer unit will be willing to insure
against any small possible loss and may
be attracted to every fair insurance
plan; the only insurance plans it may be
averse to are plans involving rather large
losses; it may be averse to all fair
gambles; if not, it will be attracted by
gambles that involve a reasonably sure,
though fairly small, gain, with a small
possibility of a sizable loss; it will be
averse to gambles of the lottery variety.-7
These consumer units therefore prefer
certainty to moderate risks; in this respect they conform to the generalization.
However, they may prefer moderate
risks to extreme risks, though these adjectives hardly suffice to characterize the
rather complex pattern of risk preferences implied for high-income consumer
units by a utility curve like that of Figure 3. Nonetheless, in this respect the
implied behavior of the high-income consurner units is either neutral or contrary
to the generalization.
Our hypothesis does not therefore lead
inevitably to a rate of return higher to
uses of resources involving moderate risk
than to uses involving little or much
risk. It leads to a rate of return higher for
uses involving moderate risk than for
uses involving little risk only if consumer
units in the two convex segments outweigh in importance, for the resource use
in question, consumer units in the concave segment-8 Similarly, it leads to a
37 These statements follow directly from considerations like those in the two preceding footnotes.
38 This statement is deliberately vague. The
actual relative rates of return will depend not only
on the conditions of demand for risks of different
kinds but also on the conditions of supply, and
both would have to be taken into account in a
comprehensive statement.

301

rate of return higher for uses involving
moderate risk than for uses involving
much risk only if consumer units in the
initial convex segment outweigh in importance consumer units in both the concave and the terminal convex segmentsthough this may be a more stringent condition than is necessary in view of the
uncertainty about the exact role of consumer units in the terminal convex segment.
This relative distribution of consumer
units among the various segments could
be considered an additional restriction
that would have to be imposed to rationalize the alleged higher rate of return to
moderately risky uses of resources. It is
not clear, however, that it need be so considered, since there are two independent
lines of reasoning that, taken together,
establish something of a presumption
that relatively few consumer units are in
the concave segment.
One line of reasoning is based on the
interpretation of the utility function suggested in section 5b above. If the concave
segment is a border line between two
qualitatively different social classes, one
would expect relatively few consumer
units to be between the two classes.
The other line of reasoning is based on
the implications of the hypothesis for the
relative stability of the economic status
of consumer units in the different segments. Units in the intermediate segment are tempted by every small gamble
and at least some large ones. If opportunities are available, they will be continually subjecting themselves to risk. In
consequence, they are likely to move out
of the segment; upwards, if they are
lucky; downwards, if they are not. Consumer units in the two convex segments,
on the other hand, are less likely to move
into the intermediate segment. The
gambles that units in the initial segment

<-----Page 24----->302

MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE

accept will rarely pay off and, when they
do, are likely to shift them all the way
into the terminal convex segment. The
gambles that units in the terminal segment accept will rarely involve losses
and, when they do, may shift them all the
way into the lower segment. Under these
conditions, maintenance of a stable distribution of the population among the
three segments would require that the
two convex segments contain many more
individuals than the concave segment.
These considerations, while persuasive,
are not, of course, conclusive. Opportunities to assume risks may not exist. More
important, the status of consumer units
is determined not alone by the outcome of
risks deliberately assumed but also by
random events over which they cannot
choose and have no control; and it is conceivable that these random events might
be distributed in such a way that their
main effect was to multiply the number
in the concave segment.
The absolute number of persons in the
various segments will count most for
choices among the uses of human resources; wealth will count most for
choices among uses of nonhuman resources.39 In consequence, one might expect that the premium for bearing moderate risks instead of large risks would be
greater for occupations than for investments. Indeed, for investments, the differential might in some cases be reversed,
since the relatively high-income consumer units (those in the terminal segment) count for more in wealth than in
numbers and they may prefer moderate
to extreme risks.
39 This distinction requires qualification because
of the need for capital to enter some types of occupations and the consequent existence of "noncompeting groups"; see Milton Friedman and Simon
Kuznets, Income from Independent Professional
Practice (New York: National Bureau of Economic
Research, I945), chap. iii, sec. 3; chap. iv, sec. 2.

In judging the implications of our hypothesis for the market as a whole, we
have found it necessary to consider separately its implications for different income groups. These offer additional possibilities of empirical test. Perhaps the
most fruitful source of data would be the
investment policies of different income
groups.
It was noted in section 2 that, although many persons with low incomes
are apparently willing to buy extremely
speculative stocks, the low-income group
receives the bulk of its property income
in the form of interest and rents. These
observations are clearly consistent with
our hypothesis. Relatively high-income
groups might be expected, on our hypothesis, to prefer bonds and relatively
safe stocks. They might be expected to
avoid the more speculative common
stocks but to be attracted to highergrade preferred stocks, which pay a
higher nominal rate of return than highgrade bonds to compensate for a small
risk of capital loss. Intermediate income
groups might be expected to hold relatively large shares of their assets in moderately speculative common stocks and
to furnish a disproportionate fraction of
entrepreneurs.
Of course, any empirical study along
these lines will have to take into account,
as noted above, the effect of the progressive income tax in modifying the terms of
investment. The current United States
federal income tax has conflicting effects:
the progressive rates discourage risky investments; the favored treatment of capital gains encourages them. In addition,
such a study will have to consider the
risk of investments as a group, rather
than of individual investments, since the
rich may be in a position to "average"
risks.
Another implication referred to above

CONCLUSION

A plausible generalization of the available empirical evidence on the behavior

to derive the upper convex segment because of the
difficulty of allowing for the effect of the income tax.

4I The existing data on stability of relative income status are too meager to contradict or to confirm this implication. In their study of professional
incomes Friedman and Kuznets found that relative
income status was about equally stable at all income
levels. However, this study is hardly relevant, since
it was for homogeneous occupational groups that
would tend to fall in a single one of the classes considered here. Mendershausen's analysis along similar
lines for family incomes in 1929 and 1933 is inconclusive. See Friedman and Kuznets, op. cit., chap

money income for all higher incomes;
6. Most consumer units tend to have incomes
that place them in the segments of the utility
function for which marginal utility of money
income diminishes.

Points i, 2, 3, and 5a of this hypothesis
are implicit in the orthodox theory of
choice;point 4 is an ancient idea recently
revived and given new content by von
Neumann and Morgenstern;and points
5b and 6 are the consequenceof the attempt in this paper to use this idea to
rationalizeexisting knowledgeabout the
choices people make among alternatives
involving risk.
Point 5b is inferredfrom the following
phenomena: (a) low-income consumer
units buy, or are willing to buy, insurance; (b) low-income consumer units

<-----Page 26----->304

buy, or are willing to buy, lottery tickets;
(c) many consumerunits buy, or are willing to buy, both insurance and lottery
tickets; (d) lotteries typically have more
than one prize. These statements are
taken as a summaryof the essential features of observed behavior not because
they are the most important features in
and of themselves but because they are
convenientto handle and the restrictions
imposed to rationalizethem turn out to
be sufficient to rationalize all the behavior described in section 2 of this

A possible interpretation of the various segments of the utility curve specified in Sb is that the segments of diminishing marginalutility correspondto socioeconomic classes, the segment of increasingmarginalutility to a transitional
stage between a lowerand a highersocioeconomic class. On this interpretation
the boundariesof the segmentsshould be
roughlysimilarfor differentpeople in the
same community;and this is one of several independentlines of reasoningleading to point 6.
This hypothesis has implications for
behavior,in addition to those used in deriving it, that are capable of being contradictedby observabledata. In particular, the fundamental supposition that a
single utility curve can generalize both
riskless choices and choices involving
risk would be contradictedif (a) individuals wereobservedto choosethe largerof

two certain incomes offered to them but
(b) individuals were willing to pay more
than the largest possible gain for the
privilege of bearing risk. The supposition
that individuals seek to maximize expected utility would be contradicted if
individuals' reactions to complicated
gambles could not be inferred from their
reactions to simple ones. The particular
shape of the utility curve specified in Sb
would be contradicted by any of a large
number of observations, for example, (a)
general willingness of individuals, whatever their income, who buy insurance
against small risks to enter into small
fair gambles under circumstances under
which they are not also buying "entertainment," (b) the converse of a, namely
an unwillingness to engage in small fair
gambles by individuals who are not willing to buy fair insurance against small
risks, (c) a higher average rate of return
to uses of resources involving little risk
than to uses involving a moderate
amount of risk when other things are the
same, (d) a concentration of investment
portfolios of relatively low-income groups
on speculative (but not highly speculative) investments or of relatively highincome groups on either moderately or
highly speculative investments, (e) great
instability in the relative income status
of high-income groups or of low-income
groups as a consequence of a propensity
to engage in speculative activities.
