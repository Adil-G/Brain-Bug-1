During the last fifteen years, Akaike's entropy-based Information Criterion (AIC) has had a
fundamental impact in statistical model evaluation problems. This paper studies the general
theory of the AIC procedure and provides its analytical extensions in two ways without violating
Akaike's main principles. These extensions make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize
overparameterization more stringently to pick only the simplest of the "true" models. These
selection criteria are called CAIC and CAICF. Asymptotic properties of AIC and its extensions
are investigated, and empirical performances of these criteria are studied in choosing the correct
degree of a polynomial model in two different Monte Carlo experiments under different conditions.
Key words: model selection, Akaike's information criterion, AIC, CAIC, CAICF, asymptotic
properties.

PSYCHOMETRIKA

As is well known, a fundamental difficulty in statistical analysis is the choice of an
appropriate model, estimating and determining the order or dimension of a model. This is
a common problem when a statistical model contains many parameters. The main purpose of model evaluation is to "understand" the observed data. According to Parzen
(1982), statistical data modeling is a field of statistical reasoning that seeks to fit models to
data without knowing what the "true" model is or might be.
Consequently, one seeks to learn the model and study the quality of the model by a
process which is called statistical model identification or evaluation. In recent years, in the
literature, the necessity of introducing the concept of model selection or model evaluation
has been recognized and the problem is posed how to choose the "best approximating"
model among a class of competing models with different numbers of parameters by a
suitable model selection criterion given a data set. Also, there is presently a great deal of
interest in simple criteria represented by parsimony of parameters for choosing one of a
set of competing models to describe a given data set. As discussed in ,Stone (1981),
parsimony can take into account a variety of attributes of the selected model. One such
attribute is the cost of measuring the models required to implement the model. Measurement cost, which was emphasized by Lindley (1968), is especially relevant in certain
applications. A second attribute is the complexity of the selected model. The general
principle is that for a given level of accuracy, a simpler or a more parsimonious model is
preferable to a more complex one, known as Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor emphasizes
the desirability of selecting the accurate and parsimonious models of reality. Therefore,
the best model is the one with least complexity, or equivalently the highest information
gain. For example, in factor-analytic models, parameter parsimony requires that we
choose the smallest number of factors such that the corresponding model fits the data.
The selection of a parsimonious model, in general, is a nontrivial problem without the aid
of model selection criteria. They are called "figures of merit" for competing models. That
model, which optimizes the criterion, is chosen to be the best model.
Akaike, in a very important sequence of papers, including Akaike (1973, 1974, 1977,
and 1981a), was perhaps one of the first who laid the foundation of the modern field of
statistical data modeling, statistical model identification or evaluation. He developed the
information-theoretic, or entropic AIC criterion for the identification of an optimal and a
parsimonious model in data analysis from a class of competing models which takes model
complexity into account. The AIC criterion is a simple and versatile procedure which can
be viewed as a relatively logical and predictable expression of earlier work of N e y m a n
and Pearson (1928, 1933), Wald (1943), and Kullback (1959), among others. It has enormous practical importance and is one more demonstration of the importance of the
likelihood ratio criterion in statistical inference.
In the next section, section 2, we give the necessary theoretical background needed
for the development of AIC.

2.1

Information Quantity as a Measure of Goodness of Fit

Kullback-Leibler Information Quantity or Negentropy

In any statistical problem we are given a set of observations. These observations are
the values of some random variables whose probability distribution is usually unknown
to us, or we have some knowledge of it. F r o m the information provided by the data, we
draw inferences about the unknown aspects of the underlying distribution, such as the
unknown "true" parameter values of the distribution which govern the generation of the
observed data and also govern the generation of any future observations if we adopt the
predictive point of view.

We shall express a model in the form of a probability distribution and regard fitting
a model to the data as estimating the true probability distribution from the data and treat
the estimation and the evaluation of a model together as one entity rather than separating
them. In the statistical literature during the past fifty years, there has been a meaningless
separation of estimation and testing which did not help the development of a practical and
successful statistical model selection and evaluation procedure (Akaike, 1974).
If we had an objective measure (a metric) of the distance between the model and the
true distribution, a good inference procedure ought to make this distance as small as
possible. One measure of this type is Boltzmann's (1877) generalized entropy, or the negentropy which is also known as the Kullback-Leibler (1951) information quantity. Hereafter,
we refer to this as K-L information quantity for brevity.
Even though the development of AIC has its origins in time series modeling where its
practical utility has been thoroughly studied. However, the major development of AIC lies
in the direct extension of an entropic or information-theoretic interpretation of the
method of maximum likelihood. Its introduction is based on the entropy maximization
principle, or minimizing its negative; it is based on the minimization of the K-L information quantity.
To develop this point further, suppose X is an absolutely continuous random vector
characterized by a probability density function f(x[0) which is known apart from the
K-dimensional parameter vector 0 = 0 r = (01, 02 . . . . , OK), OK ~ ff~r. Assume that there
exists a true parameter vector 0* of 0 with its probability density denoted by f(xl0*).
Within this setup, it is required that we select 0 "closest" to the true parameter vector 0".
Thus, we will measure the "closeness," or the "goodness-of-fit," off(xl0*) with respect to
f ( x I0) by the generalized entropy B of Boltzmann (1877), or K-L information quantity I:
B(0*; 0) = - I(0"; O).

(1)

This is defined by
B(0*; 0) = E[log f ( X I 0) - log f ( X I 0")]
=

ftx 10,)logf(x,0)dx-f f ( x , 0 * ) l o g f ( x l 0 * ) dx

= n(0*; 0) -- n(0*; 0"),

(2)

where E denotes the expectation with respect to the true distribution f(xl0*) of x,
H(0*; 0) = ~ f(xl0*) log f ( x l 0 ) dx is the cross-entropy which determines the goodness of
fit o f f ( x l 0 ) to f(xt0*), H(0*; 0") --= H(0*) the usual Shannon negative entropy which is
constant for a givenf(x I0"), and where "log" means natural logarithm.
Instead of maximizing the entropy criterion (2), we minimize the K-L information
quantity:
t ( 0 * ; 0) = -

B(0*; 0)

= H(0*; 0") - H(0*; 0).

(3)

Since H(0*; 0") = H(0*) is a constant in both (2) and (3), we only have to estimate the
cross-entropy or the expected log likelihood
H(0*; 0) = E[logf(X 10)]
=

ff(x

I 0.) log f ( x Io) dx.

and second partial derivatives for 0 E R r, then, under these conditions, H(0*; 0) in (4) can
be differentiated twice under the integral sign with respect to 0 and evaluated at 0 = 0",
yielding

H'(0*; 0") = 0,
(5)
/-t"(0*; 0") = - J(0*),
where J(0*) is the Fisher's (1922) amount of information pertaining to 0* per observation
from f(xl0*). From (5), we note that Fisher's information per observation is the second
derivative of the K-L information quantity. To put it another way, J(0*) essentially
measures the curvature of the expected log likelihood H(0*; 0) at its maximum value
which occurs at 0 = 0". The quantity H(0*; 0) plays a crucial role in the development of
AIC, and is of basic importance in statistical information theory.
The analytic properties of I(0"; 0) are extensively discussed by KuUback (1959). Here
we list some of the important ones.
(i) I(0"; 0) > 0 wheneverf(xl0*) ~ f ( x [ 0 ) ,
(ii) I(0"; 0) = 0, if and only i f f ( x l 0 * ) = f ( x l 0 ) a.e. (almost everywhere) in the possible range of x, when the model is essentially true,
(iii) if X 1, X 2, ..., X n are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables, then the K-L information quantity for the whole sample is

xn(0*; 0) = nl(0*; 0).
This last property says that if the random variables are independent, the K-L information
quantity is additive.
We note that K-L information quantity is perhaps the most general of all information measures in the sense of being derivable from minimal assumptions and it represents a relative measure.
As it stands, the K-L information quantity in (3) is not directly observable or estimable. To see this, we give the following simple example as an illustration.

Example 2.1.1. Let F be the family of normal distributions {N(#, a2): --ov < g < or,
0 < a 2 < ~}. L e t f ( x l 0 * ) ~ N(#*, a .2) be the true distribution with the parameter vector
0 " = (~*, a,2), and let f(xlO)~ N(Â¢, a 2) be our model with 0 = (4, tr2)- Computing
I(0"; 0) = l[f(xl 0*);f(x I 0)], we obtain
/(0.; o) = ~ log \ o2 /

I o2

~ . i _1

(6)

We see that the distance between the means contributes to the K-L information quantity
quadratically; while the contribution of the variances is through the ratio tr*2/tr2. Further,
we note from this example, and in general, that the K-L information quantity needs to be
estimated from the observed data since it depends on the true distribution, and consequently on the unknown true and model parameters. The important question we need to
answer is: How can we make the K-L information quantity operationalized, or approximated, from the observed data so that we can use it to compare the goodness of fit of
various models, measure the distance or deviation of the fitted model from the "true"
model?

2.2 Mean Log Likelihood as an Estimate of K-L Information Quantity
or Negentropy

In this section we introduce the concept of mean log likelihood as a measure for the
goodness of fit of a model and state entropy maximization principle (EMP) according to
Akaike (1977).
Suppose that the generation of data is described by a model given by a probability
density function f(x]0). Given n independent observations from the same distribution
regarded as a function of a vector-valued parameter, 0 = (01, 02, ..., OK), k = t, 2, ..., K,
the likelihood function for the set of data is
n

L(O) = f ( x 1. . . . . x, 10) = 1-If(x, 10).

(7)

t=1

The log likelihood function, d(0) (often called the support), is the natural logarithm of L(0)
and is defined by
d(O) -- log L(O) = ~. log f(x~ I 0),

(8)

i=l

regarded as a random variable, is the sum of i.i.d, random variables log f(xtlO), i = I, 2,
...,

n.

We define the average or mean log likelihood of the sample by
1

_1 d(0) = - l o g L ( 0 ) = n

n

hi=

1

= :.(0),

(9)

which can be interpreted as an estimator of the "distance" between the true probability
densityf(x I 0") and the modelf(x 10).
As we discussed in the previous section, the K-L information quantity is not observable. However, it can be consistently estimated from the observed data and operationalized.
Let ]'(0"; 0) denote an estimator of the K-L information quantity I(0"; 0). Then (3)
becomes
r(O*; O) --/7(0"; 0") --/7/(0*; 0),

(10)

R(0*, 0) -- --I(0"; e) +/7(0*; e*).

(I1)

or

This tells us that maximizing the expected log likelihood /~(8"; 0) is asymptotically
equivalent to minimizing the K-L information quantity, ~0", 0), and it is not necessary to
know/7(0*; 0") =/7(0"), since it is an additive constant and can be dropped. However,
we will retain it for the clarity of our exposition.
Assuming that a sample of n observations x = (xx, x 2 . . . . . x~) is used to provide an
estimate 0 = 6(x) of 0, we observe that the mean log likelihood in (9) is a natural estimator of/-7(0*; e), the expected log likelihood. That is,
Z(0) ~

E I 1 d(0)l =/~(0"; 0 ) = E[log f ( X 10)],

(12)

where again the expectation is taken relative to the true distributionf(x ] 0") of x, and that
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) 0 is a natural estimator for 0", so (10) can then

<-----Page 5----->350

(13)

or

1:(6)

(14)

Certainly, one approach to measure how well the maximum likelihood modelf(xi I(})
"matches" the data would be to test the hypothesis that the K-L information quantity
1(0"; 0) = 0. Such a test might be based on (n)X/2r(0*; 6), but establishing the asymptotic
closed form expression of the distribution of this statistic is a nontrivial problem (White,
1982). It is for this reason that we need to appeal to the asymptotic behavior of the mean
log likelihood and also to asymptotic approximations to derive AIC.
From Property (ii) in section 2.I, we have seen that 1(0"; 0 ) = 0, if and only if,
f ( x l 0 * ) = f ( x l 0 ) a.e. in the possible range of x, when the model is essentially true. Hence,
from (9), we note that asymptotically the maximum of :~(0) = 1/n log/_,(0) (the mean log
likelihood) will be H(0*) --= Sf ( x I0") log f ( x I 0") dx, the negative Shannon entropy, and
this will be attained when f(x[0*) = f ( x [0) a.e. This result can also be obtained from the
property of the function z(0) or/7(0"; 0), the expected log likelihood in (12) which is: z(0)
o r / / ( 0 " ; 0) attains its maximum value at 0 = 0", and if distributions on the sample space
corresponding to different parameters are essentially different, then for no other 0 is z(0)
equal to z(0*) (Silvey, 1975, p. 74).
Since our estimation of K-L information quantity is based on the mean log likelihood (which is also an estimate of the expected log likelihood), and since the maximum
likelihood estimates are biased, then there is the inevitable risk of error of estimation of
the K-L information quantity when the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters
of the model is used.
In the case where 0 is a real parameter, for large n, we depict the general behavior exhibited by the mean log likelihood 1/n:(O) and the expected log likelihood z(O)=
E[1/n:(O)] = E[log f ( X [O)] in Figure 2.1.
From Figure 2.1, we see that /-7(0*; 0) assumes its maximum value at 0", and that
1/n:(O) is uniformly near /-7(0*; 0) ensures that 1/nÂ¢(O) assumes its maximum value at a
point near 0", that is, O(x) near 0* as discussed in Silvey (1975). In other words, for finite
n, we would like to have the observed values of the mean log likelihood (dashed lines) to
behave like the theoretical points (solid line) of Figure 2.1. To achieve this, the bias
introduced by the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters needs to be adjusted
or corrected.
Empirical justification of the behavior of the mean log likelihood plotted against the
number of parameters are illustrated in detail by Atilgan (1983), and Atilgan and Bozdogan (1987) in smoothing and density estimation under various basis functions including
those of B-splines, normal kernels, and logistic density transform.
Since the quantity H(0*; 0) is not directly observable, maximization of the mean log
likelihood is carried out, and asymptotically an unbiased estimator of the mean expected
log likelihood is searched by correcting the bias of the observed mean log likelihood, En(6).
Indeed, in defining AIC, Akaike (â¢973, 1974) has exactly this consideration of the bias

by penalizing extra parameters when the maximum likelihood estimates are used in
estimating the expected log likelihood by the mean log likelihood.
Now we are in a position to give the definition of entropy maximization principle
emphasized by Akaike (1977) which is quite different from (and should not be confused
with) Jayne's (1957) maximum entropy principle.

Definition 1: Entropy maximization principle (EMP). Formulate the object of statistical inference as the estimation of the true distributionf(x I0") from the data x = (x 1, x 2 ,
.... x,) and try to search for an approximate model f ( x l 0 ) which will maximize expected
entropy:
Ex[B(O*; 0)] = f B(O*; O)f(x I0") dx
= ExrH(O*; 0)1

= Ex{E[logf(XlO)] }.

(15)

Equivalently, we minimize the expected K-L information quantity.
Large expected log likelihood E[logf(XI0)] means large entropy, and it also means
that the model f ( x l 0 ) is a good fit to f(xl0*), or, equivalently, the low value of I(0"; 0)
means that the model f ( x t 0) is a good fit to f ( x I0"). Thus, it is by the mean of B(0*; 0),
1(0"; 0), or the mean expected log likelihood over the sampling distribution of the estimator of 0 that we will judge a particular model and measure our ignorance about the
true structure of the model.
This definition will play an important role in that, since entropy or negentropy is
nothing but a log odds ratio between the fitted model f ( x t0) and the true distribution
f(xl0*), it can be used as a loss function, and its expected value can be used as a risk
function to measure the average estimation error of the fitted model from the true one as
suggested by Akaike (1973).
Next, we derive AIC in detail as a natural sample estimate of E[logf(XI0)], the
expected log likelihood.

Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) as an Estimate of Negentropy

Suppose that we have a general model f ( . 10) from which all the K competing
models are generated by simply restricting the general parameter vector 0. In terms of the
parameters, we represent the full model with K parameters by
MODEL(K):

f ( . [0),

0 = Or = (01, 02 . . . . . Ok, Ok+l . . . . . Or).

(16)

We denote the "true" value of the parameter vector 0 by 0* with 0* e R ~. Following
Akaike (1973), the problem of statistical model identification can be formulated as the
problem of selecting a model f ( x 10k) based on n observations. In terms of parameters, Ok
is restricted to the space with Ok+ 1 = Ok+2 . . . . .
OK = 0, or equal to a prescribed value
of 0 k , and that a particular restricted model with k parameters is given by
MODEL(k):

f ( . 10k), Ok = (01, 02 . . . . . Ok, 0, 0 . . . . . 0).

(17)

Often k, the number of free parameters of MODEL(k), is called the dimension or order of
the model. If werepresent parametric estimation geometrically in terms of a Euclidean
projection shown in Figure 3.1, we denote the maximum likelihood estimate of Or by Or
both of which lie in R r (the K-dimensional Euclidean space). We let 0* denote the true
parameter vector with 0 e R x, and define 0~' as the parameter vector of the best fitting or
approximating mbdel with 0f ~ R ~ (k-dimensional parametric subspace Rk of the original
space Rr). We note that the parameter vector 0f is the projection of the true parameter
vector O* in the subspace R k. Next, we let 0 k denote the restricted maximum likelihood
estimator of Ok of MODEL(k) which lies in R ~, and which is also the projection of 0x in
R k. Thus, geometrically ( 0 f - Ok) will constitute our random error. It can be viewed

<-----Page 8----->353

HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

approximately as the projection of (0" - 0x) into the subspace ~k. On the other hand,
(0" - 0~') is deterministic and is the bias due to selecting an approximate parameter space.
To elaborate further, following Clergeot (1984), if for different values of k, subspaces
R k are chosen so that R k c R k+l, the bias, which is the distance of 0* to the subspace R k,
is a nonincreasing function of k, while the r a n d o m error increases monotonically with k.
Thus, our goal here will be to find some optimal value of k so that the compromise
between bias and random error will give the smallest estimation error.
The AIC statistic which we next state in the form of a proposition and sketch its
derivation is designed to approximate the real model by a lower dimensional model so as
to minimize the average estimation error.

Proposition 1: Akaike's information criterion (AIC): Let {Mk: k = 1, 2 . . . . . K} be a set
of competing models indexed by k = 1, 2, ..., K. Then the criterion
AIC(k) = - 2 log L(0k) + 2k,

(18)

which is minimized to choose a model M k over the set of models is a natural sample
estimator of twice the negentropy, 2E[I(0*; Ok)'] , o r minus twice the expected log likelihood, - 2E[log f ( X I Ok)], of the true distribution with respect to a model with the parameters determined by the method of m a x i m u m likelihood.

Proof. Following Akaike (1973, 1974, 1976), and Kitagawa (1979), we first assume a
model which specifies a probability density function f(xlOk) of n observations with a free
parameter vector Ok and then find the M L E 0 k of 0 k with Ok e R k by maximizing the
likelihood function
L(Ok IX) = L(0k Ix1, x2 . . . . . xn) ---- l~I f(xilOk) ,

(19)

i=1

with respect to Ok . By taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, and dividing by the sample size n, we get

Since the purpose of estimating the parameters of the true model f ( x l 0 * ) is to base

E q u a t i o n (30) represents the overall risk of statistical modeling which measures the

the other which involves k, is a m e a s u r e of variance or the r a n d o m error due to estimating

O f course, it is impossible to minimize (30) directly since the bias 6 = n 110* - 0 f It2 is
unknown, but it is deterministic. It needs to be estimated in practice with finite samples.

It follows from the above discussion that if the K - L information quantity, I(8"; Ok), is

may not be defined clearly. Even under such circumstances we choose limited number of
k's, assuming K to be equal to the larger hypothesized value of k. Since we are only
concerned with finding out the Ok which will give the minimum of ~ ( r r ; Ok) in (39), or
equivalently, the minimum of 2nE[I(O*; 0k)] in (38), we have only to compute either
f ( x , I 0~________)
k V r = k r / r + 2 k = - - 2 ~ ,= 1 log f(xi 10K) + 2k,

(40)

or, ignoring the constant terms in (38) common to every model, we reduce the form of
AIC to a much simpler form
n

AIC(k) = - 2 ~ log f ( x i [Ok) + 2k

= --2 log L(Ok) + 2k,

(41)

and choose the minimum of AIC over k = 1, 2. . . . . K.
This completes the derivation of AIC and the sketch of the proof of the proposition.
[]
We note that AIC(k) in (41) is an unbiased estimator of minus twice the mean
expected log likelihood, or equivalently - Â½ AIC(k) is asymptotically an unbiased estimator of the mean expected log likelihood. This result suggests that asymptotically a
reasonable definition of the likelihood of a model is

L(k) = exp {-- Â½ AIC(k)}

(k = 1, 2. . . . . K).

(42)

In fact, with the assumption of equal prior probability for the models, the distribution of
(42) defines the posterior distribution of models. If there are several models with almost
equal values of AIC, it is useful to consider the averaged model by using (42) as the
"likelihood" of each model as discussed in Akaike (1978, 1979).
We interpret the result in (41) as follows. The first term in (41) is a measure of
inaccuracy, badness of fit, or bias when the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the model are used. The second term, on the other hand, is a measure of
complexity or the penalty due to the increased unreliability or compensation for the bias
in the first term which depends upon the number of parameters used to fit the data.
Thus, when there are several competing models the parameters within the models are
estimated by the method of maximum likelihood and the values of the AIC's are computed and compared to find a model with the minimum value of AIC. This procedure is
called the minimum AIC procedure and the model with the minimum AIC is called the
minimum AIC estimate (MAICE) and is chosen to be the best model. Therefore, for us the
best model is the one with least complexity, or equivalently, the highest information gain.
In applying AIC, the emphasis is on comparing the goodness of fit of various models with
an allowance made for parsimony.

Consistent Akaike's Information Criterion: CAIC(k)

As we saw in the derivation of AIC in the previous section, one of the important
virtues of AIC is the penalty represented by the term 2 x (number of free parameters)
clearly demonstrates the necessity of choosing a class of models, at least one of which will
be able to provide a good approximation to the distribution of the data without adjusting
too many parameters. However, in the literature, the particular specifications put on the
crucial structure-dependent term in AIC, that is, the so-called "magic number" 2, has been

<-----Page 12----->HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

357

questioned unfairly as being coincidental or arbitrary (Rissanen, 1978). If one follows the
derivation of AIC in section 3, the emergence of the magic number 2 is hardly debatable.
The debating questions should be: Is the magic number 2 enough, should it be greater
than 2, how do we choose such a number, or on what does it depend, and so forth?
Based on the frequency of choice of the correct model from a simulation study, many
authors, including Bhansali and Downham (1977), in a time series model, arbitrarily
considered the range of the magic number to be between 1 and 4. The propriety of such a
choice has been criticized by both Akaike (1979) and Atkinson (1980) on the grounds of
lack of objectivity and the need for more explicit analytical formulation.
Objections have been raised that minimizing AIC does not produce an asymptotically consistent estimate of model order (Bhansali and Downham, 1977; Schwarz,
1978; Woodroofe, 1982; and others). However, consistency is an asymptotic property, and
any real problem has a finite sample size n as stated in Sclove (1987). Certainly, from a
mathematical point of view, consistency is an attractive asymptotic property to expect
from a model selection procedure, but any consideration of consistency presupposes that
there exist "true" order of a model. In the case of real data, the concept of the true order is
not known and is suspect.
Even though the AIC procedure is not claimed to be consistent and is not designed
to be such (Akaike, 1981b; Quinn, 1980), its inconsistency is not necessarily a defect in the
method, and the virtue of consistency should not be exaggerated (Hannah, 1986). Shibata
(1983) extensively studied the asymptotic behavior of AIC procedure and its variants in
terms of asymptotic efficiency under a quadratic loss function. He found that AIC actually
achieves the implicit goal that motivated Akaike--it does the best that any modelselection procedure can do in minimizing negentropy, or the expected log likelihood, at
least for a large sample size n (Larimore & Mehra, 1985).
In general, the major dilemma here is how to balance optimally the underfitting and
overfitting risks, or how to optimally adjust the bias in the log likelihood ratio when the
maximum likelihood estimates are used.
Without violating Akaike's principles, using the established results in mathematical
statistics, we improve and extend AIC analytically in two ways. These extensions make
AIC asymptotically consistent, and that we penalize overparameterization more stringently to pick the simplest of the true models whenever there is nothing to be lost in
doing so.
In section 2.2, we discussed the fact that when the mean log likelihood is used to
estimate the K-L information quantity, the bias introduced by the maximum likelihood
estimates of the parameters needs to be adjusted or corrected. In the derivation of AIC,
this bias comes out as a noncentrality parameter, 6, which is a very large unknown but
deterministic constant. It depends not only on the number o f observations but also the
specific estimation method used. For example, in our case this method is the maximum
likelihood (ML) method. Moreover, the distributional change in 6 for different sample
sizes is also crucial to justify the correction of the bias further. That is, we do not want to
have a very large 6, since it varies with the basic model. As is well known, noncentrality
parameters determine the power of test procedures, and the estimation of 6 on the basis of
preliminary data may be necessary to choose among competing models.
We note from (35) that one such correction in 6 is already given in deriving AIC, that
is, 6 - - 2 log 2 - (K -- k). Also we note that this correction factor v = (K - k) is independent of the sample size n. However, in testing a null hypothesis (or a model) distinguished from the alternative hypothesis (or hypotheses) by the value of a parameter, if
the test statistic has a noncentral chi-square distribution which is the case here, then the

<-----Page 13----->358

PSYCHOMETRIKA

degrees of freedom is an increasing function of the sample size n (Kendall & Stuart, 1967).
This suggests that to make AIC consistent, the multiplier of the number of free parameters in the penalty term must be made to depend on the sample size by setting

v = a(nXK - k),

(43)

where a(n) is an increasing function of n. In AIC, we note that a(n) = 1. As discussed in
Davis and Vinter (1985), the selection of the function a(n) is important, and it should be
chosen so that it has various desirable properties for the corresponding estimates. Recapitulating Davis and Vinter (1985), the properties of a(n) which might be required are:
(i) high probability of choosing the correct dimension of the model, or order for finite
data sets; and
(ii) consistency, that is, asymptotically correct choice of k as n--} ~ ,
Presently, in the literature there is no theory available as to how to choose the
correct dimension of a model with high probability. On the other hand, consistency holds
almost surely for certain choices of a(n) including the choice a(n) = log n, where "log"
denotes the natural logarithm. Therefore, we choose a(n)= !og n since it provides a
monotonically increasing function of the sample size n, such that a(n)/n---, 0 as n---} oo (see
also, e.g., Akaike, 1978). We shall denote this type of modified AIC by a generic name,
CAIC. So if we take v = (K - k) log n, then we have the following proposition.

Proposition 2.

(44)

CAIC(k) = - 2 log L(6k) + k[(log n) + 1].

Proof. Recall from (30) that
2nEll(O*; Ok)] ~ 6 + k.

(45)

6 ~- --2 log 2 -- v,

(46)

6 ~ - 2 log A - (K - k) log n.

(47)

Since

and since v = (K - k) log n, then

Substituting this into (46) and simplifying, we get
2nE[/(O*; Ok)] --~ --2 log L(O~) + k log n
+ k + 2 log L(@r,) -- K log n.

(48)

Since CAIC estimates the quantity 2nE[l], that is, twice the expected Kullback information, then
CAIC(k) = - 2 log L(@k)+ k log n + k + 2 log L(0r) - K log n.

(49)

Since the constants do not effect the results of comparison of models, we drop the additive
terms and reduce the form of CAIC(k) to a much simpler form, namely
CAIC(k) = - 2 log L(Ok) + kl-(log n) + 1].

[]

(50)

This shows that AIC can be fairly easily extended to make it consistent, even though
a practical difficulty is that consistency is a weak property (Atkinson, 1980). Note that
CAIC(k) is similar to the Schwarz's (1978) Criterion of k log n, and that the term
[k log n + k] has the effect of increasing the "penalty term." Consequently, the mini-

<-----Page 14----->HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

359

mization of CAIC leads, in general, to lower dimensional models than those obtained by
minimizing AIC.
In the literature, Hannan and Quinn (1979) proposed a(n) = c log log n, where c > 2.
Their objective was to provide a consistent criterion in which a(n) increases with n but at
as slow a rate as possible. If we let k < k(n), where k is an upper bound of k, possibly
depending on n, other choices of a(n) are:

a(n) = (log n) l+b

and

k(n) = (log n)c,

(51)

where b and c are arbitrary strictly positive constants.
Next, we give yet another analytical extension of AIC which will unify all these
procedures.

Consistent AIC with Fisher Information: CAICF(k)

In this section, exploiting the large sample asymptotic distributional properties of the
maximum likelihood estimators, we propose a different estimator for minus twice the
expected entropy to extend AIC analytically to make it consistent without deviating from
Akaike's original premise. In this manner we penalize overparameterization more
strongly, in particular, for large samples. Therefore, instead of dropping the term
2 log L(Or) in (38) as we do in simplifying the expression to obtain a simple form for AIC,
we retain this term and propose a different approximation to L(Or) which estimates the
likelihood function L(0*) of the true model. This means that one can specify the true
model to be the most general of the models to be selected and consider the fact that the
observations are generated by the true density f ( x l 0 * ) instead o f f ( x l 0 ~ ) . This way we
can estimate the unknown parameters of the true and approximate models by using the
maximum likelihood estimators and their properties, and obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 3.
CAICF(k) = - 2 log L(Ok) + k[(log n) + 2] + log I J(0k) l
-- mIf(k) + k log n + log I J(0k) l.

(52)

T o show the derivation of this proposition, we consider x i.i.d., and we assume that
the true parameter vector 0* satisfies the restrictions set by the following model in terms
of the parameters:
MODEL(k): Ok = (01, 02 . . . . . Ok,

0, .... 0),

(53)

and that Ok*-- 0k = O(n- 1/2), where O denotes the "order of."
Using the properties of the maximum likelihood estimates for regular models, it is
well known that the MLE Ok of 0~' is, at least asymptotically, a sufficient statistic for 0~'.
This can be shown easily by the factorization theorem of the likelihood of the kind to
establish sufficiency (Cox & Hinkley, 1974). Assuming that 0 k is at least asymptotically
sufficient for 0~, under this assumption, it is easy to establish the following theorem for
asymptotic normality.

Theorem 1. A maximum likelihood estimator Ok is asymptotically distributed as
multivariate normal with mean vector 0f and covariance matrix (nJ)- 1. That is,
a.d.

Ok ,'~ Nk(Ok*;(nd(0*))- 1).

(54)

<-----Page 15----->360

So the asymptotic multivariate normal density of Ok is given by
g(0k) ~

exp { -- {(Ok -- 0*)'n J(0")(0 k -- 0")},

where Ok is the maximum likelihood estimate of 0* and inverse covaraince matrix is

(56)

where d(e*) is the Fisher information matrix at 0* with respect to one observation.
For large samples, we approximate the likelihood o f f ( x 10*) the true density at 0* by
L(e*; 0k) = O(e*)L(0*) = O(0*) exp {log L(0*)}, using Taylor series expansion of 9(0*) and
exp {log L(0*)} around the ML estimate Ok. Taking the product of two Taylor series
expansions and using the leading terms, we obtain
L(O*; Ok) - (nk I J(0D I)1/2
(27t)k/2
exp { -- }(Ok - Ok*') nJ(O k*)(O
^k - 0,)} [1 + O(n- 1/2)].

(57)

Hence, using asymptotic sufficiency, we can write
L(0*) = h(x)C(0*; Ok)

(58)

by the factorization criterion, where h(x) is independent of the particular parameter vector
0 we choose, and the second factor L(0*; Ok) depends on x only through the value of
Ok - 0k(X), which is sufficient for 0".
Now, in (38) we replace L(OK) by L(0,) given in (58) assuming that 0* (the true
parameter vector) is situated near 0" (the restricted or pseudotrue parameter vector) and it
"almost" satisfies the restrictions set in (53) and get
kt/K = --2 log L(fik) + 2 log L(O*).

(59)

So, from (58) and (57), we have
log L(0,) = log h(x) + log L(0*; Ok)
k
k
= log h(x) + ~ log n + x2 log I J(ODI - ~ log (21t)

O(n-

x/z)].

(60)

Now, multiplying both sides of (60) by 2, we get
2 log L(0*) = 2 log h(x) + k log n + log IJ ( 0 * ) l - k log (2n)
--

(Ok -- Ok)nJ(O

(61)

Since log [1 + O(n-1/2)] is about of order n-a/2, since (e* - Ok) is of order n-x/2,
nd(O*) is of order n, which implies (Ok -0~,')'nJ(0*)(0k- 0,) is of order O(1), then (61)
reduces to
2 log L(0*) = 2 log h(x) + k log n + log I J(0*)l - k log (2x) + O(n-I/2).

(62)

Thus, the approximation involves an error of order n-x/2.
In Equation (62), by ignoring the constant terms, the term involving x, and O(n-x/2),
we have
2 log L(O*) = k log n + log {J(O*)l.

(63)

<-----Page 16----->HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

361

~K = --2 log L(0k) + k log n + log I J(0*)l

(64)

Hence, (59) reduces to

Now estimating J(0*) by
result into (38), we obtain

2nE[l(O*; Ok)'] ~

J(Ok)in (64) where
--2 log

Ok is the M L E of Ok*, and substituting the

L(Ok)+ k log

n + log

I J(0~)I

+ 2k - K

= --2 log L(0k) + k[(log n) + 2] + log IJ(0~)I - g .

(65)

Simplifying (65) further, we have
CAICF(k) = - 2 log L(0g) + kE(log n) + 2] + log I J(0k) l
= AIC(k) + k log n + log I J(0k) l.

(66)

We note that if we take the first two terms in (66), CAICF is similar to CAIC of
section 4, and also Schwarz's criterion (SC, 1978).
Hence, this way, without relying on the arbitrary frequency of choice of the correct
model to modify AIC heuristically, we can analytically extend AIC to make it consistent.
In this manner we penalize the overparameterization more strongly, in particular, for
large samples. Note that we have not deviated from Akaike's original principle: we are
still estimating minus twice the expected entropy. Also, note that we have not followed a
Bayesian approach.
The incorporation of the Fisher information matrix J(Ok) within the penalty component of CAICF has many practical and theoretical importance. Generally, when we are
using model-selection criteria, we fit the models under a specified parametric probability
distribution of the model. The correct specification of the probability model is a sufficient,
but by no means a necessary condition. For example, even when the true distribution is
not normal, we still find the maximum likelihood estimators under the assumption of
normality which yields consistent estimates of the mean and the variance. But it is the
consistency of the mean log likelihood which ensures us the basis for robust estimation,
and that it provides us the basis for constructing specification tests. Therefore, we need to
check or test first whether the probability model is misspeeified or not before we actually
fit and evaluate the models. This is very important in practice which is often ignored. For
this reason, following White (1982), we give a simple test of information matrix equivalence
to check the misspecification of a model. First, we define the following matrices
J.(0*) = - - { ~

R.(0*) =

If the expectations exist, we define

R(Ok*)= {E[.a lÂ°gf(XlO*) . O lÂ°gf(XlO*)}
where both in (67) and (68), r, s = 1, 2 . . . . , k.

<-----Page 17----->362

When the appropriate inverses exist, we define
Cn(O*) = J.(Ok*)- 1Rn(Ok*)J~(Ok*)- 1 ----Jn- 1R. J~- 1,
(69)
C(0*)=

where J(0*) is the Fisher's information matrix which is positive-definite, and C(0*) is the
covariance matrix. When the model is correctly specified and certain assumptions hold as
in White (1982, p. 6), we have the following result.
Theorem 2: Information matrix equivalence. If f ( x ) - f ( x t 0 * ) for 0* in f~r, then
0* = 0~' and J(0*) = R(0~'), so that the covariance C(0~') = J(0~')- 1 = R(0~')- 1
Note that, in general, J(0*) will not equal R(0~') when the model is misspecified.
However, when the model is correctly specified, then this theorem says that the information matrix can be expressed in either Hessian form, J(0*), or outer product form,
R(0*), giving equivalently,
J(O*) -- R(O*) = O.

(70)

The matrix in (70) is not directly observable, but we can consistently estimate it by
J(Ok) -- g(Ok) = 0,

(71)

and construct an appropriate test statistic to test whether a model misspecified or not.
For example, if the equality in (71) fails, then this indicates that the probability model is
misspecified. In practice, this misspecification may have many serious consequences when
the classical inferential procedures are used. Furthermore, the failure of information
matrix equivalence might also indicate misspecifications which render the M L E to be
inconsistent for particular parameters of interest. Therefore, (71) is a useful indicator of
misspecifications which cause either parameter or covariance matrix estimator inconsistency.
If we find that J(0k), the estimated information matrix, is singular (or nearly singular)
and so indefinite, we have an indication that the K-L information quantity has no unique
minimum at 0", the true parameter vector. Therefore, CAICF as a large sample asymptotic estimator of the mean K-L information quantity will not have a unique minimum
also. Furthermore, this in practice means that there are parameter vectors 0 Â¢ 0* such
that the expected mean log likelihood z(0) = z(0*) given in (12), and this in turn means
that there are different parameters yielding the same distribution so that 0 is not identifiable. Thus, lack of identifiability of 0 implies singularity of information matrix and vice
versa (Silvey, 1975, p. 82). Near singularity of the information matrix will also give us an
indication of high variances for the estimators which is not preferred. In either case, the
parameters may not be estimated with any high degree of accuracy. In this respect, one
advantage of using CAICF in (66) is that it generalizes and unifies model selection
procedures, and that, whenever possible, one should compute J(Ok), test whether the
model is correctly specified or not, and then proceed with model fitting and evaluation.
Indeed, if we cannot achieve a unique minimum by using CAICF, then this should be an
indication that we have problems in identifying the parameters. In that case, we should
bring in a priori information in order to impose restrictions on the model or tackle the
problem with reparametrizing the model.
As discussed in Sclove (1987), Kashyap (1982), taking the Bayesian approach, took
the asymptotic expansion of the logarithm of the posterior probabilities a term further

<-----Page 18----->HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

363

than did Schwarz (1978) and obtained the criterion approximately given by
KC(k) = - 2 log L({Jk)-- log f(0~) + k log n + log [ n(lJ~)[,

(72)

where f(0~') is the prior probability density on the parameter vector 0~'. B((Jk) is the
negative of the matrix of second partials of log L(0k), evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates. In Gaussian linear models, this is the covariance matrix of the maximum
likelihood estimates of the regression coefficient; in general, the expectation of B({Jk),
evaluated at the true parameter values, is Fisher's information matrix. If we assume equal
probabilities for f(0*), the term togf(0~') in (72) will be ignored, and thus we can see the
relationship between K C and our extension of AIC, i.e., the CAICF given in (66). Similar
results are also given in Haughton (1983) by extending the Schwarz's criterion for exponential families a term further than did Schwarz.

Asymptotic Properties and Inferential Error Rates of the Criteria

It is well known that the classical theory of hypothesis testing is concerned with the
problem: Is a given observation consistent with some stated hypothesis or is it not? In the
hypothesis testing tradition, frequently ignoring power considerations, we choose an arbitrary significance level ~, for example, the celebrated 5%, 2.5%, or 1%, and then we try to
determine (at least approximately) a critical value from the standard tables of the test
procedures to make our decision. Almost automatically, we also apply the hypothesis
testing procedures to the situation where actually multiple decision procedures are required. However, this involves the choice of a number of dependent significance levels
without knowing what the overall error rate might be. Also, test procedures do not have
the provision to penalize overparameterization since usually an unstructured saturated
model is always used as a reference (Akaike, 1987).
On the other hand, when we use the information-theoretic model selection criteria,
we do not specify what the arbitrary significance level ~ should be or ought to be. This is
due to the fact that in using model selection criteria, the situation is totally the opposite of
the classical inferential procedures. In this case, we are concerned with: Choosing a
critical value which then determines, approximately, what the significance level is or
might be. Therefore, the significance level is implicitly incorporated within the model
selection criteria which depends on the specific functional form of the penalty component
of the criteria and on the number of observations.
In general, for model selection criteria, the inferential error rate decreases exponentially as we increase n, the number of observations. Following Efron (1967), suppose we
are given n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations x 1, x 2 . . . . . x, of a
random variable X having probability density functionf(x). Suppose we are asked to test
the simple hypothesis:
vs.

Ho: f(x) -~fo(x)

at some significance level ~, 0 < ~ < 1. It is well known that the most powerful test which
rejects H o for large values of the likelihood ratio
2 = f i fl(x~)

~Â°1 fo(x,)

F r o m this, we have the following:

Theorem 3. F o r a specified level of significance ct, 0 < at < 1, under the null h y p o t h esis in (73), we have
fl(~) = P { T y p e II error} = exp { - - n I + O(1)}.

(77)

T h e Converse of this result is also true if we try to minimize ct = P { T y p e I error}
(probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis), keeping fl only fairly small satisfying
lim

So, following ~ e n c o v (1982, p. 122), we state the following:

Theorem 4. F o r a specified fl, 0 < fl < 1, under the null hypothesis in (73), we have
~t(fl) = P { T y p e I error} = exp { - n I + O(1)}.

(79)

This means that b o t h 0t and fl cannot tend to zero faster than the exponential rate
where lim,_.~ 0(1) = 0. Thus, for example, ~t is small when the K - L information quantity
is large, and vice versa. This rate of convergence to zero of ct can also be used as a
criterion for evaluating the a s y m p t o t i c p e r f o r m a n c e of the information-theoretic procedures. Typically, for consistent criterion, this rate is exponential as stated in the a b o v e
theorems.
T o show the T y p e I error for A I C and CAIC, suppose that the "true' dimension is

(81)

<-----Page 20----->HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

Therefore, using AIC it is possible to choose a dimenison k' > k* (the true dimension), the probability of Type I error stays positive but decreases exponentially as
(k' - k*) gets larger and the critical value (i.e., 2) of the test remains finite n ~ oo. So, even
asymptotically, there is a positive probability of overestimating the true dimension or the
size of the model. Therefore, model selection criteria, including AIC, which have this
property are often called dimension inconsistent. On the other hand, with CAIC and
CAICF, the probability of Type I error goes to zero as n--~ oo. It also decreases exponentially as ( k ' - k * ) gets larger, but at a much faster rate. Therefore, asymptotically, the
probability of overestimating the true dimenson or size of the model with these criteria
equals zero, making them dimension consistent. (For more on the properties of model
selection criteria, we refer the reader to Ter~isvirta & Mellin, 1986; and Woodroofe, 1982.)
Without going into detailed proofs, we simply state the following results.
Result 1. Using CAIC or CAICF if k' < k*, where k* is the true dimension of the
model, the probability of underfitting a model goes to zero as n---~ oo.
Result 2. Using CAIC or CAICF if k' > k*, the probability of overfitting a model
disappears as n ~ ~ .

Note that when we use AIC, CAIC, and CAICF, the "level of significance" is adjusted
in such a way that the corresponding probability of rejection of the simpler model
decreases as the degrees of freedom or complexity increase. These procedures, therefore,
have tendencies to adopt simpler models compared with the chi-square test procedure as
the degrees of freedom increase. Comparing to AIC, for CAIC, the implied ~ values
rapidly decrease as the degrees of freedom increase. The same is also true for CAICF.
However, this rate of decrease depends on n, the number of observations. For large
samples, as the degrees of freedom increase, the implied ~ values for these criteria decrease
very sharply.
This connection between model selection criteria and the level of significance ~,
provides us a way to test the validity of different restrictions of a model. Also, it gives us a
yardstick in comparing every possible model and choosing the model giving the smallest
probability of rejection to be the best fitting model. This fact justifies the comparison of
the model selection criteria in a class of models which cannot necessarily be compared by
the classical goodness of fit test. We can use these results to decide what the level of
significance should be per complexity or restriction when we do classical hypothesis
testing rather than arbitrarily deciding what ct should be on a priori grounds. Thus, in the
sense of Theorem 3 and 4, these model selection procedures can be called inferential-errorrate consistent.

A Numerical Example

In this section, to demonstrate the practical utility and to show the empirical performances of the model selection criteria, we provide a Monte Carlo example in determining the degree of a polynomial model in one variable. Choosing the degree of a polynomial model is a major problem that arises when the relationship between y and x is
considered to be curvilinear. Fitting a polynomial with the maximum degree K is a
multiple decision problem which is often formulated in terms of a sequential hypothesis
testing to test whether the coefficients are zero, starting with the highest specified degree.
Following Graybill (1976), we consider the polynomial model of degree K given by
Yi = flo + fllx~ + f12 X2 --I- "'" .-~ flK XiK .4- e

i = 1, 2, ..., n > K + 1,

where K is a specified positive integer. We assume that the degree of the polynomial
model in (82), say k, is less than or equal to K (given), and the problem is to determine the
exact degree. As we mentioned, the procedure is to test the hypothesis H o : / ~ = 0, then
test ilK- 1 = 0, then test ilK- 2 = 0, and so on against the alternative of nonzero coefficient
until a hypothesis is rejected. Suppose /~k = 0 is the first hypothesis that is rejected, then
we declare that the model of degree k is the correct model. If no H 0 is rejected, then we
declare the simple model Yi = flo + e~ is the correct model.
It has been shown by Anderson (1962) that this procedure for determining the degree
of a polynomial model has some desirable optimality properties. However, as we know,
application of test procedures to such multiple-decision problems involves the choice of a
number of dependent significance levels. This creates the problem of how to control the
overall error rate of the test procedures for determining the correct degree of a polynomial model. As an alternative to the classical inferential procedures, here we propose
the use of model selection procedures to determine the degree of a polynomial model.
To demonstrate this, we carried out a Monte Carlo study under the true cubic
polynomial model given by
y = 1 + 5 x - - 1.25x 2 + O.15x 3 + 5,

experiments, the condition for the consistency of order determination by C A I C F holds
perfectly.
Looking at Table 7.2, we note that the results are different from that of Table 7.1.
This is due to the fact that we increased the residual variance t72 to 5 in 100 replications of
the M o n t e Carlo Experiment. F o r n = 50, AIC and C A I C are performing much better
than C A I C F in choosing the correct degree (k = 3) of the polynomial model. In fact, the
proportion of underfitting for C A I C F is 77%. However, for CAICF, the underfitting
diminishes as n, the sample size, gets large and the condition of consistency holds. These
results suggest that when n is small and residual variance ~2 is large, C A I C F might have
the tendency to underfit the true order of a polynomial model. But, as we saw, this
behavior of C A I C F disappears as n gets large. We emphasize the fact that this was the
only extreme example for C A I C F when n = 50 a m o n g m a n y repetitions of the M o n t e
Carlo experiment.
Overall, we observe that AIC, CAIC, and C A I C F are powerful tools to determine the
best fitting model. They are superior to classical inferential methods in terms of their
computational simplicity, in terms of not arbitrarily specifying a significance level ~, and
not worrying what the overall inferential error rate might be or ought to be in determining the degree of a polynomial model, and in general.

Conclusions and Discussion

In this paper, we studied the general theory of the AIC procedure, presented its
mathematical derivation and showed the emergence of the magic number 2 in its derivation. We provided analytical extensions of AIC in two ways without violating Akaike's
main principles which make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize overparameterization more stringently rather than relying on the heuristic or arbitrary modifications.
We investigated the asymptotic properties of AIC and its analytical extensions. We
studied the inferential error rates of these procedures for testing the validity of different
complexities. The preference of one or the other of these criteria in a given situation
depends on how "conservative" or "liberal" we want to be in terms of setting the level of
significance a per complexity and avoid overfitting and underfitting risks.
If we want to avoid overfitting a model, then we should use the consistent criteria:
C A I C and CAICF, sometimes at the cost of underfitting a model in finite samples, which
leads to a significant increase in bias. Of course, as the number of observations gets large,
for the consistent criteria, the probability of underfitting and overfitting a model will
diminish. This suggests that one should use these consistent criteria for large samples. If
we want to avoid underfitting a model, then we should use AIC.
There is no single criterion which will play the role of a panacea in model selection
problems. Presently, however, AIC has become part of a general m o v e m e n t away from a
purely inferential and restrictive approach to model selection. As a consequence, it provided us a new and modern way of thinking of how to tackle m a n y important statistical
modeling problems. F o r this reason, the profession is greatly in debt to Akaike for
repeatedly calling our attention to the very important model evaluation and selection
problem.
