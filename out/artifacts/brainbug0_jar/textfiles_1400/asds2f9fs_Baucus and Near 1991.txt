CAN ILLEGAL CORPORATE BEHAVIOR BE
PREDICTED? AN EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS
MELISSA S. BAUCUS
University of Kentucky
JANET P. NEAR
Indiana University
A model of illegal corporate behavior was developed and tested for a
19-year period using event history analysis and data on clearly illegal
acts. Results indicated that large firms operating in dynamic, munificent environments were the most likely of the firms studied to behave
illegally, and firms with poor performance were not prone to commit
wrongdoing. Membership in certain industries and a history of prior
violations also increased the likelihood that a firm would behave illegally.

Recently, research on corporate wrongdoing has shifted from a case
study approach in which a few firms in a single industry are studied to
investigations comparing a large number of firms in fairly diverse industries
(Clinard, Yeager, Brissette, Petrashek, & Harries, 1979; Cochran & Nigh,
1987; Dalton & Kesner, 1987; Kesner, Victor, & Lamont, 1986; Simpson,
1986; Szwajkowski,

1981, 1985). Despite

increased

attention

to illegal cor-

porate behavior, numerous challenges confront researchers investigating
corporate illegality. This study contributes to research in that area by attempting to address some key issues.
First, few comprehensive theories of corporate illegality have been
developed,1 so it has been difficult for researchers to identify conditions that
lead to illegal activities or to specify relationships among antecedent conditions. To address this problem, we integrated theoretical contributions
from a number of disciplines into a model of illegal corporate behavior and
then used data on violations by Fortune 500 firms to empirically test hypothesized relationships between antecedent conditions and illegal corporate behavior.
Additionally, a common assumption in the literature on corporate illegality has been that different antecedents result in different types of illegal
acts-for instance, that environmental scarcity might predict antitrust violations but not employment discrimination. To test this assumption, we

empirically developed models for each type of illegal activity to determine
if the same pattern of antecedents precedes different types of illegal behavior.
Third, although there has been a call for longitudinal research on these
issues (Clinard & Yeager, 1980), researchers have conducted only a few
longitudinal studies (Baucus, 1987; Simpson, 1986). Instead, researchers
have used five-year averages or trends when predicting illegal behavior (Clinard et al., 1979) in an effort to incorporate changes in antecedent conditions; however, some information is lost through this approach. In some
cases, researchers have examined antecedent conditions existing before the
announcement of legal action against a firm or the resolution of a case rather
than before the actual occurrence of the illegal behavior. In this study, we
used event history analysis to conduct a longitudinal investigation of the
relationships between the hypothesized antecedent conditions and the actual occurrence of illegal behavior.
Finally, this study provides a conservative test of relationships between
antecedent conditions and corporate illegality. Rather than study activities
that were merely questionable or unethical but not necessarily illegal, we
selected cases in which managers knew or should have known that the firm
was committing an illegal act. An example may help to illustrate this distinction.
Recently, a federal court judge found Allegheny Bottling, a Pepsi-Cola
bottling franchise, guilty of price fixing. The firm had ended years of cola
wars by setting prices with its major competitor, Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola
Bottling (New York Times, 1988). Since evidence showed most executives in
the firm knew of the illegal price-fixing scheme, the court not only fined
Allegheny $1 million but also sentenced it to three years in prison-a sentence that was suspended since a firm cannot be imprisoned. However, the
unusual penalty allowed the judge to place the firm on probation and significantly restrict its operations.
In another case, Harris Corporation pleaded no contest to charges that it
participated in a kickback scheme involving a defense department loan to
the Philippines (Wall Street Journal, 1989). Although this plea cost the firm
$500,000 in fines and civil claims, Harris's chief executive said the firm and
its employees were not guilty of criminal conduct; he maintained that top
managers pleaded no contest because the costs associated with litigation
would have been greater than the fines, and litigation would have diverted
management attention from firm operations.
Although both cases appear to be instances of illegal corporate behavior,
there is an important distinction between them. In the first case, Allegheny's
executives knew or should have known the firm's activities were illegal;
price fixing is a clear violation of antitrust law. Further, the courts ruled that
evidence indicated the firm had engaged in the illegal act. In contrast, it is
not clear that Harris Corporation's managers committed an illegal act. Some
areas of the law are very ambiguous, including the area relevant to this case,
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and managers may not at times know what

<-----Page 3----->1991

Baucus and Near

11

is legal or illegal; thus, a firm may inadvertently engage in behavior that is
later defined as illegal. No contest pleas, paying fines, and so forth do not
establish a firm's guilt. As the Harris case illustrates, executives may agree to
such resolutions to avoid the costs and time involved in a legal battle.
Previously, researchers investigating corporate illegality have relied primarily on cases similar to the Harris case: regulatory violations in which a
firm paid a fine, pleaded nolo contendere, or signed a consent decree (Clinard et al., 1979; Cochran & Nigh, 1987; Szwajkowski, 1981). In these cases,
illegal behavior may not have occurred, and the activities studied may be
more accurately described as dubious behavior (Bromiley & Marcus, 1989) or
organizational misconduct (Szwajkowski, 1986). Since the antecedents of
illegal behavior and more general types of organizational misconduct like
unethical or questionable behavior may differ, we restricted the present
study to corporate acts that were clearly illegal. We investigated only cases
or employees with authority to take
in which a firm's agents-managers
action-knowingly
engaged in illegal acts. These were violations in which
the law assumed a firm acted with knowledge or intent and the courts ruled
that the firm was guilty of illegal behavior. Our goal was to investigate
corporate illegal behavior rather than corporate wrongdoing.
Four types of activities met the criteria for clearly illegal behavior: (1)
certain discrimination violations, (2) certain antitrust violations, (3) product
liability violations with punitive damages, and (4) other violations, such as
violating a consent decree, willful patent infringement, and so forth. We
explain each type of violation in more detail in a later section.
The present study contributes to knowledge of illegal corporate behavior by proposing and testing a model of illegal corporate behavior using
longitudinal data on environmental, internal, and situational antecedents
and clearly illegal corporate activities. Further, by creating separate models
for each type or category of illegal behavior, we addressed the issue of
whether antecedents vary for each type of illegal behavior.
ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS
Figure 1 depicts the three classes of antecedent variables examined in
our model: environmental, internal, and situational variables. The first three
variables, scarcity, dynamism, and heterogeneity, describe conditions associated with a firm's environment and are derived from Aldrich's (1979)
formulation of key environmental dimensions. The three internal variables,
which represent individual characteristics of firms themselves, are analogous to the personality variables used when individuals are studied; in this
model, we posited poor performance, large size, and low slack as firm-level
variables that lead to illegal behavior.
Situational variables represent conditions with both internal and environmental elements, but these variables are related directly to a specific
instance of illegality. A history of prior violations is a characteristic of a firm
itself, but the firm's environment influences that characteristic because reg-

ulating agencies monitor various firms' activities differently, depending on
their location, industry, and visibility. Industry membership is also an internal characteristic, however, because the managers of a firm choose its
niche. In this study, the importance of industry membership is not a matter
of an industry's technology but rather of its environmental responses and
regulating agencies' responses to that industry. Some industries are more
likely than others to have members that engage in wrongdoing, perhaps
because of history or structure; and illegality is more likely to be observed in
some industries than in others because law enforcement or regulatory agencies are more exacting in the case of the former. Thus, prior violations and
industry are antecedent variables that are related clearly to neither environment nor firm, in this particular case; instead, they are short-term characteristics of the particular situation in which a firm finds itself. Finally, the
type of illegality in which a firm engages is also a situational variable because it represents a characteristic of a specific situation.
Environmental Antecedents
Theories of environment have focused on identifying a list, or comprehensive set, of independent or uncorrelated characteristics, following Aldrich's (1979) formulation. We considered all these characteristics important
because they create conditions that result in managerial actions-some

Scarcity. Previous research has frequently hypothesized that environmental scarcity affects organizational behavior (March & Simon, 1958; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Staw & Szwajkowski, 1975). An environment with
scarce resources increases the uncertainty facing a firm (Pfeffer & Salancik,
1978), and managers will take action to reduce that uncertainty (March &

<-----Page 5----->1991

Baucus and Near

13

Simon, 1958), including engaging in illegal activities when they experience
difficulty acquiring the resources necessary for survival (Staw & Szwajkowski, 1975). Thus,
Hypothesis 1: Firms operating in an environment with
scarce resources will be more likely to commit violations
than firms in munificent environments.
Dynamism. Firms rely on a number of mechanisms to cope with or
control dynamic, turbulent (Emery & Trist, 1965), or rapidly changing environmental conditions; illegal behavior may result from those efforts (Finney
& Lesieur, 1982; Gross, 1978). For instance, firms facing change may differentiate their structures, adding specialized divisions or departments. The
resulting specialists deal with only one segment of the changing environment. Thus, responsibility for overall decision making and segments of key
decisions are spread across a number of individuals, and no one individual
has sufficient authority or information to prevent or stop illegal activities.
Firms try to reduce environmental uncertainty so that they can use
standard operating procedures (SOPs) to deal with routine situations. Dynamic environments make doing so difficult, increasing the likelihood that
a firm will behave illegally while applying faulty SOPs or operating without
SOPs (Kriesberg, 1976).
The case of FTC v. Consolidated Foods Corporation, 396 FS 1344
(1974) illustrates how dynamism may result in illegal behavior. Conso Products, a division of Consolidated Foods, was charged with price discrimination (charging different prices to different retail buyers) and signed a consent
order agreeing to change its pricing policies. In 1974, the firm was charged
with violating the consent order by continuing to maintain its discriminatory pricing despite warnings from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Conso's management argued unsuccessfully that changing competitive conditions, particularly the entrance of new competitors into its markets and
increased pressure from existing competitors, prevented the firm from altering its policies. In this case, illegal behavior appears to have resulted mainly
from managers' efforts to cope with a dynamic environment.
Hypothesis 2: Firms operating in a dynamic environment
will be more likely to commit violations than firms in a
stable environment.
Heterogeneity. This aspect of complexity (Aldrich, 1979; Dess & Beard,
1984) refers to the degrees of similarity and diversity of the organizations
and individuals in a firm's environment; high uncertainty and competitiveness are associated with a heterogeneous, or diverse, environment. Firms
attempt to reduce uncertainty and competition in their environment because
they can deal more effectively with a stable environment than an unstable
one-for example, standard operating procedures can be developed in stable environments (Aldrich, 1979; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). When heterogeneity is high, a firm has to deal with many, diverse organizations in its
environment (multiple suppliers, regulatory agencies, and so forth) and the

<-----Page 6----->14

uncertainty they engender. Thus, it is more likely to engage in illegal behavior than it would be in a homogeneous environment.
Hypothesis 3: Firms operating in a heterogeneous environment will be more likely to commit violations than
firms in a homogeneous environment.
Internal Antecedents
Poor performance. Since the primary goal assumed to be guiding corporations is profitability, poor or declining financial performance has been
one of the most frequently posited antecedents of corporate illegality (Clinard & Yeager, 1980; Finney & Lesieur, 1982; Gross, 1978). Poor performance
pressures firms to find alternative sources of resources or to cut costs in ways
that may not be legal (Clinard et al., 1979; Cochran & Nigh, 1987).
Hypothesis 4: Firms with poor financial performance will
be more likely to commit violations than firms that are
performing well.
Large organization size. Increases in size, the structuring of activities,
and decentralization tend to occur in combination in organizations (Pugh et
al., 1963; Pugh, Hickson, Hinings, & Turner, 1968). Communication and
coordination problems and increased uncertainty within a firm result, possibly leading to illegal behavior as managers attempt to cope with the situation.
As a firm increases in size, it creates specialized units to deal with
subsets of activities and decentralizes decision making, empowering the
specialized units; this decentralization creates more units in which wrongdoing can occur and increases opportunities for illegal behavior (Vaughan,
1982). Personal and structural controls decrease as a firm grows, resulting in
violations (Finney & Lesieur, 1982); more employees are available to commit
illegal acts, probably without corresponding increases in the control of their
behavior. Knowledge of illegal activities may not spread beyond the unit or
units involved.
Although earlier research has not shown a relationship between size
and illegal behavior (Clinard et al., 1979; Lane, 1953-54), results of recent
studies have shown a positive relationship between the two (Cochran &
Nigh, 1987; Dalton & Kesner, 1987). Differences between the earlier and later
studies may account for their conflicting results. Lane investigated a small
sample of firms in one industry in the Northeast, and the other researchers
cited relied on large samples of firms in the Fortune 500 or firms for which
Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT data were available; thus, Lane's results
may be unique to firms in that study. Cochran and Nigh reanalyzed the data
collected by Clinard, comparing the sizes of violating and nonviolating
firms; they noted that the positive relationship between size and illegal
behavior observed in their study was consistent with results Clinard and
colleagues obtained in an analysis of nonminor violations. Therefore, we
propose:

<-----Page 7----->1991

Hypothesis 5: Large firms will be more likely to commit
violations than small firms.
Low organizational slack. Organizational slack is the excess that remains once a firm has paid its various internal and external constituencies
to maintain their cooperation. Cyert and March wrote that slack "plays both
a stabilizing and adaptive role" (1963: 38). Firms with slack resources have
more alternatives to illegal behavior than firms without slack; the former are,
for instance, less likely to be dependent on a single product and more able
to engage in R&D efforts to develop alternatives. Slack resources also reduce
the need for communication and coordination in a firm (Galbraith, 1973) and
facilitate managing demands from the external environment (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). In contrast, a lack of organizational slack will lead to efforts to
find additional resources or cut costs. Firms with poor material capacity
(little slack) have fewer strategic choices available than firms with a strong
capacity (Chakravarthy, 1982); thus, illegal behavior may occur as managers
attempt to cope with limited options and high uncertainty.
Hypothesis 6: Firms with low levels of slack resources
will be more likely to commit violations than firms with
high levels of slack resources.
Although interactions among the environmental and internal variables
in this study seemed possible, there was no theoretical basis in the literature
on illegal corporate behavior for hypothesizing certain combinations of variables over other combinations.
Situational Antecedents
Prior violations. A history of prior violations of the law can indicate that
a firm engages in a pattern of wrongdoing. Firms may become committed to
illegal activities (Finney & Lesieur, 1982), resulting in repeated violations.
Development of a corporate culture, or behavioral norms, in a firm that
encourages wrongdoing may also cause corporate illegality (Clinard &
Yeager, 1980), resulting in a pattern of violations.
Hypothesis 7: Firms with a history of violating the law
will be more likely to commit violations than firms without prior convictions.
Industry. Additionally, the industry in which a firm operates may be
related to the extent to which it engages in illegal behavior for at least two
reasons: illegal behavior is more frequent in some industries than in others,
and surveillance and legal enforcement is more strict in some industries
than in others. If an industry culture, the behavioral norms firms in an
industry share, results in illegal behavior (Clinard & Yeager, 1980), firms in
certain industries may be more likely to engage in wrongdoing than firms in
other industries. In fact, the reported incidence of illegal behavior differs
across industries (Simpson, 1986), and violation rates are similar for firms in
given industries (Cressey, 1976). Although we expected industry to be a

<-----Page 8----->16

strong predictor of corporate illegality, there was no theoretical basis for
predicting which industries would be more likely to engage in illegal behavior.
Type of violation. The relationships shown in Figure 1 are based on the
assumption that certain antecedents lead to illegal behavior in general; however, it is possible that a particular type of violation may depend on particcombination of antecedents may result in
ular antecedent conditions-one
discrimination, another in product liability problems. Although the results
of previous research have suggested that different antecedent conditions
lead to different violations (Clinard et al., 1979; Szwajkowski, 1981), it is still
unclear which combination of antecedents leads to each type of illegal activity. We conducted separate analyses to test whether the relationships
predicted in Figure 1 varied according to the type of illegal behavior under
consideration.
METHODS
Data
As was noted, previous studies have investigated wrongdoing in general, but we studied only cases of clearly illegal behavior because the antecedents of clearly illegal and more ambiguous violations may differ. Restricting the study to firms on the Fortune 500 list, the same basic population used
in earlier research (Clinard et al., 1979; Cochran & Nigh, 1987; Dalton &
Kesner, 1987), we gathered data on convicted and nonconvicted firms on the
list for at least two nonconsecutive years during the period 1974-83. As
Table 1 shows, the companies studied represented diverse industries as
defined by two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. In only
a few cases (SIC codes 24, 35, and 37, for example) was there much disparity
between the number of convicted and nonconvicted firms in a particular
industry group.
A search for all Fortune 500 firms convicted by the courts during the
period 1974-83 produced 141 violations committed by 88 firms, with some
firms having committed multiple violations. All violations involved acts
that decision makers knew or should have known were illegal. For convicted
firms, we used the four-digit SIC code representing the industry in which the
illegal behavior occurred to examine environmental factors; the firm's primary industry was used in ten cases in which information on the industry
involved was unavailable.
Once we eliminated convicted firms from the Fortune list, we randomly
selected a sample of 104 nonconvicted firms and gathered data on their
primary four-digit industries. Additionally, since convicted firms committed violations in primary and secondary industries, it was necessary to
gather data on both the primary and secondary industries of nonconvicted
firms to make comparisons. In order to do this, we randomly selected 42 of
the 104 firms already in the nonconvicted group and gathered data on a
randomly selected secondary industry for those firms.

Measures
Illegal behavior. We initially used Westlaw, a data base of legal cases,
and then drew on loose-leaf legal services such as the Products Liability
Reporter to compile complete data on convictions. We compiled a history of
all decisions in every case to insure exclusion of cases with overturned
decisions.
Although cases were selected by identifying convictions made during a
ten-year period (1974-83), the illegal behavior itself occurred over a 19-year
period (1963-81). Laws changed during that period, so we considered each
case in the context of what was illegal at the time the act was committed. A
dichotomous variable represented whether each firm committed illegal behavior in each of the 19 years (0 = no illegal behavior, 1 = illegal behavior).
Since illegal behavior often occurred over a period of time and the exact date
when it began was usually not available, we used the last year in which the
behavior occurred; our assumption was that the antecedent conditions that
initiated illegal behavior continued to exist, and thus illegal activities continued, throughout the period.
Four categories of illegal behavior were included in the data. Discrimination violations (49 percent of the data) consisted of the two types of
discrimination covered by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act: (1) disparate
treatment, or intentional discrimination, which refers to companies' treating
certain individuals or groups differently from others in hiring, promoting,
and so forth on the basis of their membership in a protected class covered by
Title VII, and (2) disparate impact, or unintentional (but still illegal) discrimination, which refers to use of neutral rules or policies that have an
adverse impact on protected groups Uones v. Lee Way Motor Freight, 431
F.2d 245, 1970; Quarles v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 279 FS 505, 1968). We used
disparate impact cases only when illegal behavior occurred after landmark
cases had defined disparate impact as clearly illegal. Since these cases were
widely publicized and established precedents, managers should have
known what acts were considered illegal; whether or not a given manager
knew is not the issue, but merely that the law fairly clearly defined illegal
activities, and managers were expected to know and abide by the law.
A second category was per se antitrust cases (20 percent of the data), acts
involving horizontal or vertical price fixing, horizontal division of customers or territories, bid rigging, most tying arrangements,2 and certain types of
group boycotts. Courts have determined that there is no legitimate business
reason to engage in such activities except to restrain trade (White Motor Co.
2
A tying arrangement refers to a situation in which the purchase of one product (tying
product) is conditioned on the purchase of another (tied product). For virtually all of the period
of this study, tying arrangements were considered illegal per se under antitrust law (Digidyne
Corporation v. Data General Corporation, 734 F.2d 1336, 1984); however, in recent years the
courts have softened this approach, for example, allowing tying arrangements when they are
part of a franchise agreement (Principe v. McDonald's Corporation, 631 F.2d 303, 1980) or a
comprehensive system of doing business.

v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 1963) and that "it is not necessary to consider
why the acts were committed or what effect it had on the industry" (U.S. v.
Koppers Company, Inc., 652 F.2d 290, 1981). We did not use rule of reason
violations, which involve activities such as mergers, acquisitions, and vertical division of customers or territories and in which the courts examine the
facts peculiar to each case to determine if an act was reasonable or not; in
those cases, managers may not have known an act was illegal until it was
defined as such after the fact.
The third category of illegality studied was product liability cases involving punitive damages (12 percent of the data). These cases are distinct
from most product liability cases because they involve situations in which a
manufacturer has either knowingly, intentionally, recklessly, or maliciously
disregarded consumers' or users' safety or has had knowledge of or information about product defects but failed to act on it.
The final category (19 percent of the data) consisted of other violations,
acts that were not as frequent as the others but were clearly illegal. Violating
a consent decree is an example of such a violation, since the courts must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a firm willfully disobeyed an initial
court order. Intentional securities fraud, willful or intentional patent infringement, and cases other than product liability with punitive damage
awards were other types of activities included in this category.
Six violations falling in the above categories were omitted from the
analysis: one that occurred before the start of the study and five that occurred
in the same year and the same industry as another, more serious, violation by
the same firm. We could not easily incorporate such violations into the study
since the unit of analysis was each firm in a particular industry in a given
year. More important, the analytical technique used in this study, event
history analysis, predicts the occurrence of one or more violations by a firm
or more events
in a given year, so elimination of simultaneous events-two
occurring in one unit of time-does not affect results (Allison, 1982), which
show the probability of a firm engaging in one or more violations given
particular antecedent conditions.
Each violation in the study represented a separate illegal act rather than
multiple lawsuits based on one illegal act. Two-thirds of the firms with
multiple convictions (18 out of 27 firms) committed the crimes in different
industries or committed two or more different types of violations. Also, firms
with multiple violations engaged in the illegal acts at different times, and
different individuals (at different plants or divisions of a firm) were typically
involved in the commission of each violation. For these reasons, we assumed that multiple violations by a single firm represented fairly independent observations. As Table 2 shows, illegal acts of each type were fairly
evenly distributed over time, with the exception of discrimination violations, which peaked in 1974.
Environmental antecedents. These variables were not highly intercorrelated, as the coefficients in Table 3 show.

year to the next adjusted for inflation-to
(1986) used growth in value added as an indicator of scarcity or munificence,
and appropriate data were available in the Annual Survey of Manufactures.
An environment with scarce resources will exhibit little or no growth in
value added since firms will attempt to operate as efficiently as possible.
Although an individual firm can engage in outsourcing (buying component
parts rather than making them) and affect its own growth in value added, its
action is not likely to affect the growth in value added of the industry as a
whole significantly.
The concept of dynamism incorporates characteristics of Aldrich's
(1979) stability-instability and turbulence constructs. Dynamism involves
both the degree of turnover characteristic of an industry and the interconnections among elements and organizations in a firm's environment. We
measured dynamism in a way that resembled Dess and Beard's (1984) measure, using the variance in the value of shipments in an industry over the
19-year period adjusted for inflation; data were obtained from the Annual
Survey of Manufactures. We considered the value of shipments in an industry a measure of both turnover and firms' interconnectedness because it
reflects demand for the industry's products. This figure includes the value of

products manufactured by a particular plant but sold or transferred to another plant of the same corporation, so it is likely to be larger than industry
sales; however, the variance in value of shipments provides an indication of
fluctuations in demand in an industry over time.
Although some firms may have experienced a steady increase in dynamism and others an increase, decrease, and then another increase during the
period of this study, we considered both patterns an overall increase in
environmental dynamism. Our interest was in determining the relationship
between long-term dynamism and illegal corporate behavior. We assumed
that short-term fluctuations in dynamism would not elicit much of a response from corporate managers and therefore would not elicit illegal behavior.
Homogeneity and heterogeneity indicate how similar or how different
elements or organizations in a firm's environment are (Aldrich, 1979). Previous research has shown that firms in four-digit industries confront homogeneous environments (Davis, Dess, & Beard, 1983); therefore, a good indicator of the degree of heterogeneity facing a firm was the number of different
four-digit SIC code industries in which the firm and its divisions competed.
We obtained these data from Standard and Poor's Register of Corporations,
Directors and Executives.
Internal antecedents. Financial performance was measured by return on
investment (ROI), or the net profit after taxes divided by total assets; Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT data base provided data for computing ROI.
Organizational size was measured as number of employees, information
that is available on the COMPUSTAT data base. Previous researchers have
assets, and
developed several measures of size, but its major aspects-sales,
intercorrelated
number of employees-are
highly
(Kimberly, 1976). We
chose number of employees because it is the most common measure of size
(Hall, 1987), having been used in 80 percent of empirical studies in organization theory (Kimberly, 1976).
To measure organizational slack, or excess resources, we used a financially derived measure Bourgeois (1981) and Bourgeois and Singh (1983)
advocated. We relied on Singh's (1986) concept of unabsorbed slack; previous studies have measured unabsorbed slack using quick ratios, which are
the sum of cash, short-term marketable securities, and receivables divided
by total current liabilities (Cheng & Kesner, 1988; Singh, 1986). Since the
level of organizational slack may vary by industry, we measured slack by
subtracting an industry's quick ratio from a firm's quick ratio; the difference
indicated the excess resources available to the firm relative to other firms in
the industry. A three-year moving average was used to smooth short-term
variations in firm liquidity. Data for computing firms' quick ratios were
available from COMPUSTAT, and industry quick ratios appear in Robert
Morris Associates: Statement Studies.
Situational antecedents. Prior violations were measured by creating
three dichotomous variables representing one, two, and three or more prior
violations. For each firm in each year of the study, we coded each of the prior

<-----Page 15----->1991

Baucus and Near

23

violations variables as 0 if prior violations had not occurred or if the amount
of violations was less than the number represented by the variable (one, two,
or three or more), or 1 if the amount of prior violations was equal to or more
than the number represented by the variable. Therefore, once a firm committed a violation, the value of the variable representing one prior violation
was coded as 1 in the remainder of the years of the study.
To examine the relationship between industry and illegal behavior, we
created a set of variables representing industries with the highest incidences
of illegal behavior. An examination of the frequency of violations across
two-digit industries revealed six industries in which firms had committed
ten or more violations. These were the chemicals industry (SIC code 28), the
food industry (20), metal manufacturing (33), lumber and wood products
(24), petroleum refining (29), and transportation equipment (37). Six dichotomous variables were created, each representing one of these industries; for
each firm in each of the 19 years, we coded each variable as 0 if the firm was
not operating in that industry and as 1 if it was doing so.
Analysis
Since the dependent variable was dichotomous and measured in each
year of the study, we could not use traditional statistical techniques. Event
history analysis, a technique similar to multiple regression, provided a way
to examine the relationship between the antecedents and the likelihood (the
logarithmic odds) of a firm's committing an illegal act. Event history, a
special type of log-linear analysis, provides an advantage over standard techthis case, changes in antecedniques because it uses more information-in
ent conditions in each year-in the analysis: it provides a way to include
explanatory variables that change over time, or time-varying explanatory
variables (Allison, 1984). Thus, we could examine the relationships between
the antecedents and illegal behavior in each year of the 19-year period of the
study.
Allison (1982, 1984) provides a complete description of event history
analysis; the following explanation of the discrete-time methods used in this
study comes from those works. First, we treated each year for each firm in a
particular industry as a separate observation or unit of analysis, thus creating
a set of 4,845 corporation-industry-years (133 corporations with one industry plus 61 firms with two industries times 19 years of data for each corporation-industry). We coded the dependent variable as 1 if the event for which
a firm was convicted occurred during that year and as 0 otherwise.
Actual values of the potential antecedents were obtained in each year
for the 19 years of the study (1963-81). Given the large number of observations, the large variance in most of the antecedents, and the use of maximum
likelihood estimation in event history analysis, computer analysis when the
antecedents were continuous variables would have been quite unwieldy.
Following Allison's recommendation (1984: 21), we minimized loss of information by transforming the antecedents from continuous to categorical
variables using the frequencies: we divided each variable into three catego-

<-----Page 16----->24

ries and assigned codes of 1, 2, and 3 to values in the lower, middle, and
upper thirds of the distribution. All the antecedent variables except environmental dynamism were time-varying explanatory variables. We used
stepwise logistic regression in the Biomedical Program (BMDP) statistical
package (Dixon, 1983) to model the data.
RESULTS
For purposes of illustration, we provide means, standard deviations,
and correlations for all variables for one year, 1978, in Table 3. As the table
shows, nine violations occurred in 1978, and none of those were in the other
category. Results were comparable in each of the other 18 years examined.
A Test of the General Model of Illegal Corporate Behavior
Environmental and internal antecedents were entered into the model at
the same time to test Hypotheses 1 through 6 (model 1 in Table 4). We used
effect coding rather than dummy coding for each variable; thus, the coefficient shown represents a comparison of a given level of the variable with the
lowest level; for example, a moderate level of resources was compared to
very few resources.
For log-linear models, a nonsignificant chi-square indicates a good fit.
Thus, the overall goodness-of-fit chi-square for model 1 suggested that the
model with all environmental and internal antecedents provided a good fit
of the data. The Hosmer chi-square statistic (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1980),
which uses predicted and observed frequencies for ten cells to indicate how
well predicted values fit the actual data, provided another measure of fit.
This statistic was quite small for model 1, indicating that the fit was not very
good in some cells.
Eliminating variables with nonsignificant coefficients in model 1 improved the fit of the model (model 2 in Table 4); both chi-square statistics
indicated a good fit. Model 1 was a special case of model 2, so we could
compare them by computing the difference between their chi-squares (Allison, 1982), which will have a chi-square distribution and degrees of freedom
equal to the difference between each model's degrees of freedom. This computation tests the null hypothesis that models are equal. Since the resulting
chi-square was not significant (3.35, 6 df), we considered models 1 and 2
equivalent; since model 1, with its three additional variables, did not provide a better fit than model 2, we preferred model 2, which provided the
more parsimonious explanation of the data.3
3 When modeling the data, we excluded cases with data missing on any of the variables. To
see whether this exclusion had a substantial effect on the coefficient or parameter estimates, we
reestimated models 1 and 2 with the mean substituted for any variable with a missing value.
The two resulting models were basically the same as models 1 and 2, indicating that missing
data did not bias the estimates greatly. Therefore, we allowed models generated in the subsequent analyses of the antecedents to be without missing data.

Effects of the Environmental Variables
In writing the following discussion, we converted coefficients from the
log-odds shown in Table 4 to percentages, using the formula 100 x [exponent (b) - 1], where b is the coefficient value.
Munificence. In the case of environmental munificence, results indicated that a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship existed. Specifically, a firm
operating in an environment with scarce resources was 41 percent more
likely than one operating in an environment with a moderate level of resources to engage in illegal behavior. A firm operating in a munificent environment was 32 percent more likely to behave illegally than a firm operating in an environment with scarce resources.4 Thus, there was mixed support for Hypothesis 1: illegal behavior was likely when resources were scarce
but was even more probable when resources were very plentiful.
Dynamism. With regard to environmental dynamism, the coefficient for
level 2 indicated that a firm operating in an environment with low turbulence was 43 percent more likely to engage in illegal activities than a firm in
an environment with a moderate level of turbulence. As predicted, a firm
operating in a highly dynamic environment was 51 percent more likely to
behave illegally than a firm in an environment with low turbulence. Since
the chance of illegality occurring was greatest in a highly dynamic environment, there was some support for Hypothesis 2; however, results suggested
that the relationship was curvilinear.
Heterogeneity. There was no support for Hypothesis 3: environmental
heterogeneity was not a significant predictor of illegal behavior. However,
the results suggested that heterogeneity and illegal behavior might have a
curvilinear relationship.
Effects of the Internal Variables
Performance. Coefficients for financial performance were not significant, and the relationship found was opposite that predicted in Hypothesis
not significantly more likely-to behave
4: firms were more likely-though
illegally when their performance was moderate or very good. Clearly, our
hypothesis was not supported.
Size. For organization size, the chances of illegal behavior increased by
10 percent when a firm was moderately large rather than small. Comparing
4 The
categories being compared were reversed in this case to show that illegal behavior
does occur in environments with scarce resources; we used the formula 100 x [exp (b) - 1] to
show the percentage change in the probability of illegal behavior when a firm is in an environment with moderate resources versus an environment with scarce resources (category 2 vs.
category 1). Since many studies have shown that illegal behavior is more common in environments with scarce resources than in those with plentiful resources, we used the formula 100 x
[1/(exp (b) - 1)] to show the percentage change in the probability of illegal behavior for firms
in environments with scarce resources versus those with moderate resources (category 1 vs.
category 2). We took this same approach in interpreting the coefficient for category 2 of environmental dynamism.

very large Fortune 500 firms with small ones indicated that the former were
almost twice as likely to behave illegally. The strength and significance of
this relationship supported the hypothesis that large firms are more likely to
engage in illegality; however, there may not be much difference between
small and moderate-sized firms.
Slack. There was no support for the hypothesis that firms with little
slack are more likely to commit wrongdoing than those with much slack.
Coefficients were not significant, and results were opposite those expected:
firms with moderate levels of slack were more likely to behave illegally than
firms with low levels.
Effects of the Situational Variables
Prior violations. In testing the effects of prior violations, we had no basis
for selecting one of the prior violations variables over the others, so we
entered all of them into the model at the same time (model 3 in Table 4).
Comparing this model with the model of hypothesized antecedents (model
3 vs. model 2) showed that prior violations significantly improved the fit of
the data; however, none of the coefficients for the prior violations variables
were significant. Results indicated that a firm with three or more prior violations was more likely to behave illegally than a firm with only one (odds
of 1.71 vs. 1.16); this result suggested that three or more prior violations
might be the best predictor of illegal activity, and a subsequent analysis
supported that conclusion.5
Industry. When we added industry variables to model 2, results indicated that membership in four of the six industries was a significant predictor of illegal behavior (model 4 in Table 4); however, model 4 did not fit the
data significantly better than model 2. A subsequent model using the industry variables that were significant predictors in model 4 and the threeor-more-prior-violations variable did provide a significantly better fit than
model 2.6
Specifically, firms operating in the foods, lumber, petroleum refining,
and transportation equipment (automobile) industries were more likely to
5

Space limitations prohibit presenting the results obtained from adding three or more prior
violations to model 2 without the other prior violation variables; however, results did indicate
that once the variable for three or more prior violations was added, information about one or
two prior violations did not significantly improve the ability of the model to predict illegal
activity. Further, the coefficient for three or more prior violations was significant when it was
the only prior violations variable in the model. Readers interested in the results for this analysis
can obtain them from the first author.
6
The analysis was conducted using the industry and prior violations variables that were
significant predictors of illegal behavior in models 3 and 4. The results (not shown) indicated
that most of these variables were significant predictors of illegal behavior: three or more prior
violations was highly significant, and memberships in industries two, five, or six was also a
significant predictor of illegal activity. Further, the model with the industry and prior violations
variables added provided a significantly better fit of the data than model 2. Results of this
analysis can be obtained from the first author.

engage in illegal activities than firms in other industries. Although the high
likelihood of wrongdoing in the petroleum refining and transportation
equipment industries may not surprise most people, it is interesting to note
that the chemical industry, whose members are frequently maligned for
caring little about issues other than corporate profitability, was not significantly associated with illegal corporate activities.
In general, our results for industry and illegal behavior are consistent
with those of previous research (Simpson, 1986), suggesting that industry is
an important variable requiring further attention: knowing that a firm operates in a given industry may be a good way to predict the likelihood of that
firm's engaging in illegal behavior. An issue demanding further attention is
whether certain industry cultures increase the likelihood of illegal activities
or if other factors are operating in the industries with high levels of illegality.
Some caution is necessary when investigating industry as a predictor of
illegal behavior. Researchers need to consider whether industry differences
reflect different rates of prosecution and litigation in some industries or
actual differences in illegal behavior.
Type of violation. To test the widely held belief that different antecedents lead to different types of illegality, we generated four separate models;
each had a different type of violation as the dependent variable and all the
hypothesized antecedents as independent variables. We used event history
analysis, so each analysis had a set of 4,845 corporation-industry-years.
Goodness-of-fit chi-square statistics indicated that each model provided
a good fit of the data (Table 5). Although only a few coefficients in each
model were significant (infrequency of events may affect significance levels
and standard errors), the key issue here was whether the same pattern of
relationships existed between the antecedents and each type of violation.
In general, results were mixed regarding patterns of antecedents and
illegal corporate behavior. On the one hand, for a number of antecedent
conditions, the patterns of relationships with each type of wrongdoing were
quite similar. A curvilinear relationship existed between environmental munificence and illegal behavior in all cases, indicating that firms were more
likely to commit violations when environmental resources were either very
scarce or plentiful. Similarly, illegal acts were more likely in either a fairly
stable or a very dynamic environment than in other environments; an exception was antitrust violations, which became more likely as the level of
dynamism increased. Increases in firm size were also associated with increases in the likelihood of illegality for all but antitrust violations, which
were more likely in either small or very large firms than in medium-sized
ones. Finally, when a firm had either a low or high level of slack resources,
the odds of its engaging in wrongdoing increased; the only exception was
committing discrimination violations, which was more likely to occur when
there was a moderate level of slack.
Results for the other two antecedent conditions suggested that different
patterns of antecedents may precede different illegal activities. When an

environment was either fairly homogeneous or very heterogeneous, the odds
of a firm's committing antitrust or discrimination violations increased. But
product liability and the types of violations we coded as "other" were more
likely to occur when an environment was moderately heterogeneous. Similarly, as firm performance improved, the odds of a firm committing antitrust
or product liability violations increased; however, discrimination and other
violations were more likely when a firm experienced moderate performance.
In sum, although the general model predicted illegal behavior fairly well
for several antecedents, different patterns of relationships emerged as we
considered different types of violations. It thus seems that researchers
should continue to test for differences in antecedents related to the type of
violation under consideration. Further research is needed to develop a theory of corporate illegality to serve as a basis for generating hypotheses by
types or subtypes of illegal behavior.
DISCUSSION
Since our goal was to develop and test a model of corporate illegality, we
discuss results in terms of the modified model our analyses supported. Limitations of the study and implications of the findings are also considered.
A Modified Model of Illegal Corporate Behavior
According to the modified model (Figure 2), illegal behavior occurs
under certain conditions. As predicted, large firms are more likely to commit
illegal acts than small firms. Although the probability of such wrongdoing
increases when resources are scarce, it is greatest when resources are plentiful. Similarly, illegal behavior is prevalent in fairly stable environments
but is more probable in dynamic environments. Membership in certain industries and a history of repeated wrongdoing are also associated with illegal
acts. Finally, the type of illegal activity chosen may vary according to the
particular combination of environmental and internal conditions under
which a firm is operating. This modified model suggests that researchers
need to incorporate several alternative explanations into the theoretical
work on corporate illegality.

Possible Explanations of Illegal Corporate Behavior
Within the literature on corporate illegality, the predominant view is
that pressure and need force managers to behave illegally; however, the
curvilinear pattern of findings in this study suggests that this explanation
only accounts for illegal acts in some cases. In our data, poor performance
and low slack were not associated with illegal behavior, and wrongdoing
frequently occurred in munificent environments. Alternative explanations
for the relationships revealed in the model include conditions of opportunity and predisposition.
Opportunity. Rather than tightening conditions creating pressure for
illegal acts, it may be that loosening, ambiguous conditions create opportunities to behave illegally. In terms of our model, large firm size provided
more opportunities to engage in illegal activities than small size; the former
condition may make it easy to hide illegal activities. Rules, procedures, and
other control mechanisms often lag behind the growth of a firm, providing
managers with an opportunity to behave illegally because no internal rules
proscribe such behavior.
Illegal behavior may also be an unintended outcome of employees' efforts to operate in an ambiguous situation in which established rules and
procedures do not apply and employees must use their own discretion. For
example, illegal behavior may be more likely to occur in a dynamic environment in which conditions change quickly and employees may not know
what behavior is required or expected. Similarly, in a munificent environment, firms are likely to be pursuing growth or attempting to improve their
position; illegal behavior provides a means for acquiring additional resources, or it may be an unintended outcome of managers' efforts to take
advantage of a favorable situation.
Predisposition. Szwajkowski's (1985) concept of choice referred to an
individual's predisposition to behave illegally; he implied that something
about the individual (intent or some pathological desire) would lead to illegal behavior. Our concept of predisposition differs, indicating a tendency
or inclination to select certain activities
illegal ones-over other activities
because of socialization or other organizational processes. We avoid the
assumption that a firm's managers or agents subscribe to a different set of
ethical standards than the rest of society. Instead, we recognize that organizations, and industries, can exert a powerful influence on their members,
even those who initially have fairly strong ethical standards.
Our results indicate that firms operating in certain industries tend to
behave illegally. Certain industry cultures may predispose managers to select illegal acts. If a firm's major competitors in an industry are performing
well, in part as a result of illegal activities, it becomes difficult for managers
to choose only legal actions, and they may regard illegal actions as a standard
industry practice.
A corporation's culture can also predispose its members to behave illegally. As the relationship between prior violations and illegal behavior ap-

pears to indicate, some firms have a culture that reinforces illegal activity.
Some firms are known to selectively recruit and promote employees who
have personal values consistent with illegal behavior; firms may also socialize employees to engage in illegal acts as a part of their normal job duties
(Conklin, 1977; Geis, 1977). For instance, in his account of cases concerning
price fixing for heavy electrical equipment, Geis noted that General Electric
removed a manager who refused to discuss prices with a competitor from his
job and offered his successor the position with the understanding that management believed he would behave as expected and engage in price-fixing
activities (1977: 124).
Pressure, opportunity, and predisposition can all lead to illegal activities; thus, researchers need to posit combinations of variables that create
each condition or combination of conditions. We suggest certain combinations on the basis of the results of this study and our review of the literature;
however, further research is needed to test these combinations.
Limitations of This Study
Although we tried to obtain the most accurate and complete data available on a stable group of firms, certain limitations should be noted. It may be
that some of these are unavoidable.
Generalizability. We examined the effects of resource levels in an industry on the illegal behavior of firms in that industry. Yet firms involved in
this and earlier relevant studies were members of the Fortune 500-the
largest and most profitable firms in the United States, usually conglomerates. We may assume that the various divisions of the firms operated fairly
autonomously, but it is not clear to what extent the illegal behavior of one
division was related to pressures on another part of the firm or whether such
instances occurred with sufficient frequency to confound our results. Future
research might be directed toward samples of separate subsidiaries or relatively independent divisions to minimize this problem.
Although we attempted to select convicted and nonconvicted firms
from a variety of industries, in several cases only convicted or nonconvicted
firms represented an industry; thus, it is possible that differences created by
unequal sampling of industry conditions may in part account for our results.
The time period examined also limits our results. Although our data
overlapped those presented by earlier researchers, some differences in results could be due to differences in the periods examined. By using a long
period (19 years), we attempted to avoid systematic errors of interpretation
that might be associated with shorter or more idiosyncratic time frames. In
any time period selected, the types of illegal behavior law enforcement agencies scrutinize most carefully will shift.
Finally, we examined for-profit organizations, and our results may not
apply to not-for-profit organizations. Research on organizational wrongdoing has tended to ignore differences between private and public organizations, yet clearly such differences need to be investigated if a specific theory
of organizational wrongdoing is to be developed.

Measurement. We may have excluded potential predictors of illegal
behavior; for example, we did not consider industry concentration and other
potentially useful predictors included in grand, or broader, models of corporate illegality (Baucus, 1987; Finney & Lesieur, 1982) because of simple
statistical limitations on the number of predictors.
Refinements in some of the measures used here are also needed. A
measure for environmental heterogeneity needs to be developed that captures both the number of different industries a firm competes in and the
similarity or diversity of those industries. Organizational slack should be
broadened to include other dimensions, such as potential and recoverable
slack (Bourgeois & Singh, 1983). Refinements of the other environmental
dimensions may also prove useful: rather than measuring the pattern of
dynamism over time, researchers may be able to obtain data allowing them
to assess the frequency, amplitude, and predictability of variations in an
environment (Wholey & Brittain, 1989). Such a refinement may provide
additional information about the relationships between environmental variations and illegal behavior.
In order to examine the relationships of interest, it was necessary to
choose a starting and ending point for the study arbitrarily, creating a problem known as censoring. Illegal acts may have occurred before or after the
period of the study, but information on these events was not available. For
instance, as Table 2 shows, there were few violations in the period 1964-70,
possibly because some violations within this period were resolved prior to
1974, the beginning of the period used to select cases. Although censoring
may have affected the reliability of our results, the use of maximum likelihood estimation should minimize any such problems (Tuma & Hannan,
1978; Tuma, Hannan, & Groeneveld, 1979).
Finally, rather than revealing when illegal behavior is likely to occur,
the results of our study and of previous studies of corporate illegality may
instead reveal conditions under which illegal behavior is detected, prosecuted, and punished. For example, regulatory agencies are likely to monitor
firms previously convicted for illegal activities closely. Additionally, regulatory agencies are likely to increase enforcement during certain periods, as
when the national political climate favors enforcement; the latter provides
another explanation for the infrequency of violations in certain years just
noted. At this point, little is known about how regulatory agencies select
firms for investigation or prosecution; thus, researchers need to begin to
focus on the relationship between enforcement and illegal activities.
Implications
The results of this study have implications for lawmakers and others
interested in deterring, predicting, and punishing corporate illegality. For
instance, regulatory agencies might make the best use of their limited resources by focusing on very large firms operating in dynamic, munificent
environments; since the current process of selecting firms to prosecute for

illegal activities is not random, such a strategy of targeting certain firms
should not violate societal standards of fairness or justice.
Further, firms with prior violations were more likely to commit additional illegal acts. Apparently, the current standard of punishment does not
deter illegal behavior-quite the opposite, it appears that committing illegal
acts may teach firms how to further violate the law. Of course, we must view
this finding as tentative, subject to replication, but it is still unsettling. One
interpretation is that our findings support what a suspicious, antibusiness
subgroup of the American population has always believed to be the case,
that big business will "do whatever it can get away with," violating the law
not to cope with environmental pressure but rather to take advantage of
opportunities. In any case, the present results add strength to the argument
that business is not capable of policing itself but rather is in need of substantial external supervision.
In the literature on corporate social responsibility, researchers have
maintained that business can avoid further regulation and help offset the
accompanying negative attitudes toward business by demonstrating responsible behavior. Thus, managers operating in firms with these characteristics
need to be aware of the high probability of prosecution for illegal activities
and may want to explore ways of avoiding or eliminating wrongdoing. The
alternative may well be additional policing of their activities, a possibility
unlikely to appeal to most managers.
Empirical evidence from this and previous studies clearly indicates that
relationships between antecedent conditions and illegal corporate behavior
are more complex than previous theories have assumed. Researchers' efforts
need to be directed toward incorporating additional factors, such as prior
violations, into theories and developing theoretical arguments that specify
relationships among antecedent conditions. The complexity of the relationships under investigation demands that researchers use sophisticated analytical techniques; event history analysis is one viable alternative.
