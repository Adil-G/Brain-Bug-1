SOCIAL CAPITAL, INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL,
AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL ADVANTAGE
JANINE NAHAPIET

Scholars of the theory of the firm have begun to emphasize the sources a n d conditions
of what h a s been described a s "the organizational advantage," rather than focus on
the causes a n d consequences of market failure. Typically. researchers see such
organizational advantage a s accruing from the particular capabilities organizations
have for creating a p d sharing knowledge. In this article we seek to contribute to this
body of work by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the
creation of new intellectual capital: (2) organizations, a s institutional settings. are
conducive to the development of high levels of social capital: a n d (3) it is because of
their more dense social capital that firms, within certain limits. have a n advantage
over markets in creating a n d sharing intellectual capital. We present a model that
incorporates this overall argument in the form of a series of hypothesized relationships between different dimensions of social capital and the main mechanisms a n d
processes necessary for the creation of intellectual capital.

Kogut a n d Zander recently have proposed
"that a firm be understood as a social community specializing in the speed a n d efficiency in
the creation a n d transfer of knowledge" (1996:
503). This is a n important a n d relatively new
perspective on the theory of the firm currently
being formalized through the ongoing work of
these (Kogut & Zander, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996;
Zander & Kogut, 1995) a n d several other authors
(Boisot, 1995; Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Loasby,
1991; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996).
Standing in stark contrast to the more established transaction cost theory that is grounded
in the assumption of human opportunism a n d
the resulting conditions of market failure (e.g.,
Williamson, 1975), those with this perspective
essentially argue that organizations have some
particular capabilities for creating a n d sharing
knowledge that give them their distinctive advantage over other institutional arrangements,
such as markets. For strategy theory, the impli-

cations of this emerging perspective lie in a
shift of focus from the historically dominant
theme of value appropriation to one of value
creation (Moran & Ghoshal, 1996).
The particular capabilities of organizations
for creating a n d sharing knowledge derive from
a range of factors, including the special facility
organizations have for the creation a n d transfer
of tacit knowledge (Kogut & Zander, 1993, 1996;
Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996); the
organizing principles by which individual a n d
functional expertise are structured, coordinated,
a n d communicated, a n d through which individuals cooperate (Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Kogut
& Zander, 1992; Zander a n d Kogut, 1995);a n d the
nature of organizations as social communities
(Kogut & Zander, 1992, 1996). However, notwithstanding the substantial insights we now have
into the attributes of organizations as knowledge systems, we still lack a coherent theory for
explaining them. In this article we seek to address this g a p a n d to present a theory of how
firms can enjoy what Ghoshal a n d Moran (1996)
have called "the organizational advantage."
Our theory is rooted in the concept of social
capital. Analysts of social capital are centrally
concerned with the significance of relationships as a resource for social action (Baker, 1990;
Bourdieu, 1986; Burt, 1992; Coleman, 1988, 1990;

<-----Page 2----->1998

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

Jacobs, 1965; Loury, 1987). However, as Putnam
(1995)recently h a s observed, social capital is not
a unidimensional concept, and, while sharing a
common interest in how relational resources aid
the conduct of social affairs, the different a u thors on this topic have tended to focus on different facets of social capital. In this article we
(1) integrate these different facets to define social capital in terms of three distinct dimensions; (2) describe how each of these dimensions
facilitates the creation a n d exchange of knowledge; a n d (3) argue that organizations, as institutional settings, are able to develop high levels
of social capital in terms of all three dimensions.
Our primary focus, however, is on the interrelationships between social a n d intellectual capital since, as we have already noted, there is
already a clear stream of work that identifies
a n d elaborates the significance of knowledge
processes a s the foundation of such organizational advantage. Our aim here is to provide a
theoretical explanation of why this is the case.

SOCIAL CAPITAL
The term "social capital" initially appeared in
community studies, highlighting the central importance-for the survival a n d functioning of
city neighborhoods--of the networks of strong,
crosscutting personal relationships developed
over time that provide the basis for trust, cooperation, a n d collective action in such communities (Jacobs, 1965). Early usage also indicated
the significance of social capital for the individual: the set of resources inherent in family relations a n d in community social organizations
useful for the development of the young child
(Loury, 1977). The concept h a s been applied
since its early use to elucidate a wide range of
social phenomena, although researchers increasingly have focused attention on the role of
social capital as a n influence not only on the
development of human capital (Coleman, 1988;
Loury, 1977, 1987) but on the economic performance of firms (Baker, 1990),geographic regions
(Putnam, 1993, 1995), a n d nations (Fukuyama,
1995).
The central proposition of social capital theory is that networks of relationships constitute a
valuable resource for the conduct of social affairs, providing their members with "the collectivity-owned capital, a 'credential' which entitles them to credit, in the various senses of the

243

word" (Bourdieu, 1986: 249). Much of this capital
is embedded within networks of mutual acquaintance a n d recognition. Bourdieu (1986),for
example, identifies the durable obligations arising from feelings of gratitude, respect, a n d
friendship or from the institutionally guaranteed rights derived from membership in a family, a class, or a school. Other resources a r e
available through the contacts or connections
networks bring. For example, through "weak
ties" (Granovetter, 1973) a n d "friends of friends"
(Boissevain, 1974), network members can gain
privileged access to information a n d to opportunities. Finally, significant social capital in the
form of social status or reputation can be derived from membership in specific networks,
particularly those in which such membership is
relatively restricted (Bourdieu, 1986; Burt, 1992;
D'Aveni & Kesner, 1993).
Although these authors agree on the significance of relationships a s a resource for social
action, they lack consensus on a precise definition of social capital. Some, like Baker (19901,
limit the scope of the term to only the structure of
the relationship networks, whereas others, like
Bourdieu (1986, 1993) a n d Putnam (1995),also include in their conceptualization of social capital
the actual or potential resources that can be
accessed through such networks. For our purposes here, we adopt the latter view a n d define
social capital a s the sum of the actual a n d potential resources embedded within, available
through, a n d derived from the network of relationships possessed by a n individual or social
unit. Social capital thus comprises both the
network a n d the a s s e t s that may be mobilized
through that network (Bourdieu, 1986; Burt,
1992).
As a set of resources rooted in relationships,
social capital h a s many different attributes, a n d
Putnam (1995) h a s argued that a high research
priority is to clarify the dimensions of social
capital. In the context of our exploration of the
role of social capital in the creation of intellectual capital, we suggest that it is useful to consider these facets in terms of three clusters: the
structural, the relational, a n d the cognitive dimensions of social capital. Although we separate these three dimensions analytically, we
recognize that many of the features we describe
are, in fact, highly interrelated. Moreover, in our
analysis we set out to indicate important facets

<-----Page 3----->244

of social capital rather than review such facets
exhaustively.
In making the distinction between the structural a n d the relational dimensions of social
capital, we draw on Granovetter's (1992)discussion of structural a n d relational embeddedness.
Structural embeddedness concerns the properties of the social system a n d of the network of
relations as a whole.' The term describes the
impersonal configuration of linkages between
people or units. In this article we use the concept
of the structural dimension of social capital to
refer to the overall pattern of connections between actors-that is, who you reach a n d how
you reach them (Burt, 1992). Among the most
important facets of this dimension a r e the presence or absence of network ties between actors
(Scott, 1991; Wasserman & Faust, 1994);network
configuration (Krackhardt, 1989) or morphology
(Tichy, Tushman, & Fombrun, 1979) describing
the pattern of linkages in terms of such measures as density, connectivity, a n d hierarchy;
a n d appropriable organization-that is, the existence of networks created for one purpose that
may be used for another (Coleman, 1988).
In contrast, the term "relational embeddedness" describes the kind of personal relationships people have developed with each other
through a history of interactions (Granovetter,
1992). This concept focuses on the particular relations people have, such as respect a n d friendship, that influence their behavior. It is through
these ongoing personal relationships that people fulfill such social motives a s sociability, a p proval, a n d prestige. For example, two actors
may occupy equivalent positions in similar network configurations, but if their personal a n d
emotional attachments to other network members differ, their actions also a r e likely to differ
in important respects. For instance, although
one actor may choose to stay in a firm because

'

We recognize that this terminology deviates from much
that is customary in the field of network analysis. In particular, the focus of network analysis is relational data, but
included under its heading a r e attributes that we label
structural here. Scott, for example, describes network a n a l ysis a s being concerned with "the contacts, ties a n d connections, the group attachments a n d meetings which relate one
agent to a n o t h e r . . . . These relations connect pairs of agents
to larger relational systems" (1991: 3). However, we justify
our usage both through reference to Granovetter a n d because we believe this terminology captures well the personal aspect of this dimension.

of a n attachment to fellow workers, despite economic advantages available elsewhere, another
without such personal bonds may discount
working relationships in making career moves.
In this article we use the concept of the relational dimension of social capital to refer to
those assets created a n d leveraged through relationships, a n d parallel to what Lindenberg
(1996) describes as behavioral, as opposed to
structural, embeddedness a n d what Hakansson
a n d Snehota (1995) refer to as "actor bonds."
Among the key facets in this cluster a r e trust
a n d trustworthiness (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam,
1993),norms a n d sanctions (Coleman, 1990; Putnam, 1995), obligations a n d expectations (Burt,
1992; Coleman, 1990; Granovetter, 1985; Mauss,
1954), a n d identity a n d identification (Hakansson & Snehota, 1995; Merton, 1968).
The third dimension of social capital, which
we label the "cognitive dimension," refers to
those resources providing shared representations, interpretations, a n d systems of meaning
among parties (Cicourel, 1973). We have identified this cluster separately because we believe
it represents a n important set of assets not yet
discussed in the mainstream literature on social
capital but the significance of which is receiving substantial attention in the strategy domain
(Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Grant, 1996; Kogut &
Zander, 1992, 1996). These resources also represent facets of particular importance in the context of our consideration of intellectual capital,
including shared language a n d codes (Arrow,
1974; Cicourel, 1973; Monteverde, 1995) a n d
shared narratives (Orr, 1990).
Although social capital takes many forms,
each of these forms h a s two characteristics in
common: (1) they constitute some aspect of the
social structure, a n d (2) they facilitate the actions of i n d i v i d u a l s within t h e structure
(Coleman, 1990). First, as a social-structural resource, social capital inheres in the relations
between persons a n d among persons. Unlike
other forms of capital, social capital is owned
jointly by the parties in a relationship, a n d no
one player has, or is capable of having, exclusive ownership rights (Burt, 1992). Moreover, although it h a s value in use, social capital cannot
be traded easily. Friendships and obligations do
not readily pass from one person to another. Second, social capital makes possible the achievement of ends that would be impossible without
it or that could be achieved only a t extra cost.

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

In examining the consequences of social capital for action, we c a n identify two distinct
themes. First, social capital increases the efficiency of action. For example, networks of social
relations, particularly those characterized by
weak ties or structural holes (i.e.,disconnections
or nonequivalencies among players in a n arena), increase the efficiency of information diffusion through minimizing redundancy (Burt,
1992).Some have also suggested that social capital in the form of high levels of trust diminishes
the probability of opportunism a n d reduces the
need for costly monitoring processes. It thus reduces the costs of transactions (Putnam, 1993).
Whereas the first theme could be regarded as
illustrative of what North (1990)calls "allocative
efficiency," the second theme centers on the role
of social capital as a n aid to adaptive efficiency
and to the creativity a n d learning it implies. In
particular, researchers have found social capital to encourage cooperative behavior, thereby
facilitating the development of new forms of
a s s o c i a t i o n a n d innovative organization
(Fukuyama, 1995; Jacobs, 1965; Putnam, 1993).
The concept, therefore, is central to the understanding of institutional dynamics, innovation,
and value creation.
We should note, however, that social capital
i s not a universally beneficial resource. As
Coleman observes, "[A] given form of social capital that is useful for facilitating certain actions
may be useless or harmful for others" (1990: 302).
For example, the strong norms a n d mutual identification that may exert a powerful positive influence on group performance can, a t the same
time, limit its openness to information a n d to
alternative ways of doing things, producing
forms of collective blindness that sometimes
have disastrous consequences (Janis, 1982; Perrow, 1984; Turner, 1976).
The main thesis of the work we have reviewed
thus far is that social capital inheres in the relations between a n d among persons a n d is a
productive asset facilitating some forms of social action while inhibiting others. Social relationships within the family a n d wider community have been shown to be a n important factor
in the development of human capital (Coleman,
1988). In a parallel argument we suggest that
social relationships-and
the social capital
therein-are a n important influence on the development of intellectual capital. In elaborating
this argument, we focus on the firm a s the pri-

mary context in which to explore the interrelationships between social a n d intellectual capital. Later in the article we consider how our
analysis may be extended to a wider range of
institutional settings.

INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
Traditionally, economists have examined
physical a n d human capital a s key resources for
the firm that facilitate productive a n d economic
activity. However, knowledge, too, h a s been recognized a s a valuable resource by economists.
Marshall, for example, suggests that "capital
consists in a great part of knowledge a n d organization. . . . [Klnowledge is our most powerful
engine of production" (1965: 115). He goes on to
note that "organization aids knowledge," a perspective also central to the work of Arrow (1974).
More recently, Quinn h a s expressed a similar
view, suggesting that "with rare exceptions, the
economic a n d producing power of the firm lies
more in its intellectual a n d service capabilities
than its hard assets-land, plant a n d equipment. . . . [Vlirtually all public and private enterprises-including
most successful corporations-are becoming dominantly repositories
a n d coordinators of intellect" (1992: 241).
In this article we use the term "intellectual
capital" to refer to the knowledge a n d knowing
capability of a social collectivity, such as a n
organization, intellectual community, or professional practice. We have elected to adopt this
terminology because of its clear parallel with
the concept of human capital, which embraces
the acquired knowledge, skills, a n d capabilities
that e n a b l e persons to a c t in n e w w a y s
(Coleman, 1988). Intellectual capital thus represents a valuable resource a n d a capability for
action based in knowledge a n d knowing.
This orientation to intellectual capital builds
on some central themes a n d distinctions found
in the substantial a n d expanding literature on
knowledge a n d knowledge processes. Many of
these themes have a long history in philosophy
a n d Western thought, dating back to Plato,
Aristotle, a n d Descartes. Two issues a r e of particular relevance to our consideration of the
special advantage of organizations a s a n institutional context for t h e development of
intellectual capital. These are, first, debates
about the different types of knowledge that may
exist and, second, the issue of the level of anal-

<-----Page 5----->246

ysis in knowledge processes, particularly the
question of whether social or collective knowledge exists a n d in what form.
Dimensions of Intellectual Capital
Types of knowledge. Arguably, the most persistent theme in writing about the nature of
knowledge centers on the proposition that there
a r e different types of knowledge. For example, a
key distinction scholars frequently make is between practical, experience-based knowledge
a n d the theoretical knowledge derived from reflection a n d abstraction from that experience-a
distinction reminiscent of the debate of early
philosophers between rationalism a n d empiricism (Giddens & Turner, 1987; James, 1950). Variously l a b e l e d "know-how" or "procedural
knowledge," the former frequently is distinguished from know-that, know-what, or declarative knowledge (Anderson, 1981; Ryle, 1949). It
concerns well-practiced skills a n d routines,
whereas the latter concerns the development of
facts a n d propositions.'
Perhaps the most-cited a n d influential distinction of this sort is Polanyi's identification of
two aspects of knowledge: tacit a n d explicit.
This is a distinction he aligns with the "knowing
how" and "knowing what" of Gilbert Ryle (Polanyi, 1967). Polanyi distinguishes tacit knowledge
in terms of its incommunicability, a n d Winter
(1987) h a s suggested that it may be useful to
consider tacitness as a variable, with the degree
of tacitness a function of the extent to which the
knowledge is or can be codified a n d abstracted
(see also Boisot, 1995).However, close reading of
Polanyi indicates that h e holds the view that
some knowledge will always remain tacit. In so
doing, he stresses the importance of knowing, a s
well a s knowledge, and, in particular, the active
shaping of experience performed in the pursuit
of knowledge.3 Discussing the practice of science, he observes that "science is operated by
the skill of the scientist a n d it is through the
exercise of this skill that he shapes his scientific
knowledge" (Polanyi, 1962: 49). This suggests
both a view of knowledge as object a n d of know-

Indeed, his much-referenced chapter, in which he introduces the tacit dimension, is entitled "Tacit Knowing," not
"tacit knowledge."

ing as action or enactment in which progress is
m a d e through active engagement with the
world on the basis of a systematic approach to
knowing.
Levels of analysis in knowledge a n d knowing.
Another equally fundamental cause for debate
within philosophical a n d sociological circles
centers on the existence, or otherwise, of particular phenomena a t the collective level. That is,
what is the nature of social phenomena that is
different from the aggregation of individual
phenomena (Durkheim, 1951; Gowler & Legge,
1982)? In the context of this article, the question
concerns the degree to which it is possible to
consider a concept of organizational, collective,
or social knowledge that is different from that of
individual organizational members.
Simon represents one extreme of the argument, stating that "all organizational learning
takes place inside human heads; a n organization learns in only two ways: (a)by the learning
of its members, or (b)by ingesting new members
who have knowledge the organization didn't
previously have" (1991a: 176).In contrast, Nelson
a n d Winter take a very different position, asserting that
the possession of technical "knowledge" is a n
attribute of the firm as a whole, as a n organized
entity, a n d is not reducible to what a n y single
individual knows, or even to a n y simple aggregation of the various competencies a n d capabilities of all the various individuals, equipments
a n d installations of the firm (1982: 63).

A similar view is reflected in Brown a n d Duguid's (1991)analysis of communities of practice,
in which shared learning is inextricably located
in complex, collaborative social practices.
Weick a n d Roberts (1993) also report research
demonstrating collective knowing a t the organizational level.4 Our definition of intellectual
capital reflects the second of these perspectives
a n d acknowledges the significance of socially
a n d contextually embedded forms of knowledge
a n d knowing as a source of value differing from
the simple aggregation of the knowledge of a
set of individuals.
These two dimensions of explicitltacit a n d individuallsocial knowledge have been combined
by Spender (19961, who created a matrix of four

organizational cognition.

<-----Page 6----->1998

different elements of a n organization's intellectual capital. Individual explicit knowledgewhat Spender labels "conscious knowledgen-is
typically available to the individual in the form
of facts, concepts, a n d frameworks that can be
stored a n d retrieved from memory or personal
records. The second element, individual tacit
knowledge-what
Spender labels "automatic
knowledgeH-may take many different forms of
tacit knowing, including theoretical a n d practical knowledge of people a n d the performance of
different kinds of artistic, athletic, or technical
skills. Availability of people with such explicit
knowledge a n d tacit skills clearly is a n important part of a n organization's intellectual capital
a n d can be a key factor in the organization's
performance, particularly in contexts where the
performance of individual employees is crucial,
as in specialist craft work (Cooke & Yanow,
1993).
The other two elements of a n organization's
intellectual capital a r e social explicit knowledge (what Spender calls "objectified knowledge") a n d social tacit knowledge ("collective
knowledge," in Spender's terms). The former
represents the shared corpus of knowledgeepitomized, for example, by scientific communities, a n d often regarded as the most advanced
form of knowledge (Boisot, 1995). Across a wide
range of organizations, we a r e currently witnessing major investments in the development
of such objectified knowledge as firms attempt
to pool, share, a n d leverage their distributed
knowledge a n d intellect (Quinn, Anderson, &
Finkelstein, 1996).
The latter represents the knowledge that is
fundamentally embedded in the forms of social
a n d institutional practice a n d that resides in the
tacit experiences a n d enactment of the collective (Brown & Duguid, 1991). Such knowledge
a n d knowing capacity may remain relatively
hidden from individual actors but be accessible
a n d sustained through their interaction (Spender, 1994). It i s the type of knowledge frequently
distinguishing the performance of highly experienced teams. This shared knowledge h a s been
defined as "routines" by Nelson a n d Winter
(1982), a n d it appears that much important organizational knowledge may exist in this form.
For example, Weick a n d Roberts (1993) describe
the complex, tacit, but heedful interrelating they
observed between members of the flight operations team on aircraft carriers, which they sug-

247

gest may characterize all high-reliability organizations.
For a given firm, these four elements collectively constitute its intellectual capital. Further,
the elements are not independent, as Spender
(1996) notes. However, in a stylized comparison
of individuals working within a n organization
versus the same individuals working a t arm's
length across a hypothetical market (in the spirit
of Conner a n d Prahalad's [I9961 analysis), we
use the two categories of social knowledge to
provide the crux of our distinction: as Spender
argues, "[Clollective knowledge is the most secure a n d strategically significant kind of organizational knowledge" (1996: 52). Therefore, it is
on the social explicit knowledge a n d the social
tacit knowledge that we focus our analysis of
organizational advantage. This is a n important
limitation of our theory because, by restricting
the scope of our analysis only to social knowledge, we will be unable to capture the influences that explicit a n d tacit individual knowledge may have on the intellectual capital of the
firm.
There is another important way in which we
limit our analysis. The potential advantages of
internal organization over market organization
may arise from its superior abilities in both creating a n d exploiting intellectual capital (Kogut
& Zander, 1993). We focus here only on the creation of intellectual capital a n d ignore the exploitation aspects. We have two reasons for imposing this constraint. First, comprehensive
consideration of both processes would exceed
the space available. Second, a n d more important, the benefits of intraorganizational exploitation of knowledge stem largely from missing,
incomplete, or imperfect markets for such
knowledge (Arrow, 1974; Teece, 1988; Williamson, 1975). Therefore, such advantages historically have been a part of the more traditional
market-failure-based theories of the firm. Where
we go beyond such theories is in our argument
that internal organization may, within limits, be
superior to market transactions for the creation
of new knowledge.
The Creation of Intellectual Capital

How is new knowledge created? Following
Schumpeter (19341, Moran a n d Ghoshal (1996)
have argued that all new resources, including
knowledge, are created through two generic pro-

<-----Page 7----->248

Academy of Mar:tagement Review

cesses: namely, combination a n d exchange.
While this argument is yet to be widely scrutinized, a n d although it is possible there may be
still other processes for the creation of new
knowledge (particularly at the individual level),
we believe that these two, indeed, are among
the key mechanisms for creating social knowledge; therefore, we adopt this framework for our
purposes.
Combination and the creation of intellectual
capital. Combination is the process viewed by
Schumpeter a s the foundation for economic development-"to produce means to combine materials a n d forces within our reach" (1934: 65)a n d this perspective h a s become the starting
point for much current work on organizations as
knowledge systems (Boisot, 1995; Cohen &
Levinthal, 1990; Kogut & Zander, 1992). In this
literature scholars frequently identify two types
of knowledge creation. First, new knowledge
can be created through incremental change a n d
development from existing knowledge. Schumpeter (1934),for example, talks of continuous a d justment in small steps, a n d March a n d Simon
(1958) identify "localized search" a n d "stable
heuristics" as the basis for knowledge growth.
Within the philosophy of science, Kuhn (1970)
sees development within the paradigm as the
dominant mode of progression. Second, many
authors also discuss more radical change: innovation, in Schumpeter's terms; double-loop
learning, according to Argyris a n d Schon (1978);
a n d paradigmatic change a n d revolution, according to Kuhn (1970). There appears to be a
consensus that both types of knowledge creation involve making new combinationsincrementally or radically-either by combining elements previously unconnected or by
developing novel ways of combining elements

Exchange and the creation of intellectual capital. Where resources are held by different parties, exchange is a prerequisite for resource
combination. Since intellectual capital generally is created through a process of combining
the knowledge a n d experience of different parties, it, too, is dependent upon exchange between these parties. Sometimes, this exchange
involves the transfer of explicit knowledge, either individually or collectively held, as in the
exchange of information within the scientific
community or via the Internet. Often, new
knowledge creation occurs through social interaction a n d coactivity. Zucker, Darby, Brewer,
a n d Peng (1996)recently have shown the importance of collaboration for the development a n d
acquisition of fine-grained collective knowledge
in biotechnology. Their research endorses the
significance of teamwork in the creation of
knowledge, a s identified much earlier by Penrose (1959). In developing her theory of the
growth of the firm, Penrose proposed that a firm
be viewed a s "a collection of individuals who
have had experience in working together, for
only in this way can 'teamwork' be developed"
(1959: 46).
There a r e many aspects to the learning embedded in such shared experience. They include
the specific meanings a n d understandings subtly a n d extensively negotiated in the course of
social interaction. Importantly, they also include
a n appreciation of the ways in which action may
be coordinated. For, a s Penrose observes, such
experience
develops a n increasing knowledge of the possibilities for action a n d the ways in which action
can b e taken b y . . . t h e firm. This increase in
knowledge not only causes the productive opportunity of a firm to c h a n g e . . . but also contributes
to the "uniqueness" of the opportunity of each
individual firm (1959: 53).

An interest in the ways in which such collective
learning, especially concerning how to coordinate diverse production skills a n d to integrate
several technology streams, h a s been at the

rooted in our view of intellectual capital a s embracing both
the explicit knowledge a n d the tacit knowing of a collective
a n d its members. Our view, thus, resembles more closely the
concept of combinative capabilities discussed by Kogut a n d
Zander (1992).

heart of much recent discussion of core competence as the source of competitive advantage
(Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) a n d is suggestive of
the complex ways in which exchange contributes to the creation of intellectual capital.

The Conditions for Exchange and Combination
In their analysis of value creation, Moran a n d
Ghoshal (1996) identify three conditions that
must be satisfied for exchange a n d combination
of resources actually to take place. We believe
that these conditions apply to the creation of
new intellectual capital. In addition, however,
we identify a fourth factor, which we regard as
a prerequisite for the creation of intellectual
capital.
The first condition is that the opportunity exists to make the combination or exchange. In our
context we see this condition being determined
by accessibility to the objectified a n d collective
forms of social knowledge. A fundamental requirement for the development of new intellectual capital is that it is possible to draw upon
a n d engage in the existing a n d differing knowledge a n d knowing activities of various parties
or knowing communities (Boland & Tenkasi,
1995; Zucker et al., 1996). In the academic world
the "invisible college" long h a s been recognized
a s a n important social network giving valuable
early access to distributed knowledge, facilitating its exchange a n d development, a n d thereby
a c c e l e r a t i n g t h e a d v a n c e m e n t of s c i e n c e
(Crane, 1972). Clearly, recent developments in
technology, such as Lotus Notes a n d the Internet, have considerably increased the opportunities for knowledge combination a n d exchange.
In addition, however, as the history of science
demonstrates, the creation of new intellectual
capital a l s o may occur through accidental
rather t h a n planned combinations a n d exchanges, reflecting emergent patterns of accessibility to knowledge a n d knowledge processes.
Second, in order for the parties involved to
avail themselves of the opportunities that may
exist to combine or exchange resources, value
expectancy theorists suggest that those parties
must expect such deployment to create value. In
other words, they must anticipate that interaction, exchange, a n d combination will prove
worthwhile, even if they remain uncertain of
what will be produced or how. Writing about the
anticipated outcome of a conference of business

249

practitioners a n d researchers, Slocum comments, "[Elach of us expects to learn something
of value as a result of our being here. None of us
knows exactly what we are going to learn or
what path we will take in the pursuit of this
knowledge. We a r e confident, however, that the
process works" (1994: ix). This anticipation of or
receptivity to learning a n d new knowledge creation h a s been shown to be a n important factor
affecting the success or otherwise of strategic
alliances (Hamel, 1991). It exemplifies Giddens'
(1984) concept of intentionality as a n influence
on social action and, in so doing, also acknowledges the possibility that outcomes may turn out
to be different from those anticipated.
The third condition for the creation of new
resources highlights the importance of motivation. Even where opportunities for exchange exist a n d people anticipate that value may be created through exchange or interaction, those
involved must feel that their engagement in the
knowledge exchange and combination will be
worth their while. Moran a n d Ghoshal(1996)see
this as the expectation that the parties engaged
in exchange a n d combination will be able to
appropriate or realize some of the new value
created by their engagement, even though, a s
noted previously, they may be uncertain about
precisely what that value may be. For example,
while having considerable potential, the availability of electronic knowledge exchange does
not automatically induce a willingness to share
information a n d build new intellectual capital.
Quinn et al. (1996) found, in a study of Arthur
Andersen Worldwide, that major changes in incentives a n d culture were required to stimulate
use of its new electronic network, a n d they suggest that motivated creativity, which they describe as "care-why," is a fundamental influence in the creation of value through leveraging
intellect. In his research on internal stickiness,
Szulanski (1996) also found that lack of motivation may inhibit the transfer of best practice
within the firm. However, Szulanski discovered
that far more important as a barrier was the lack
of capacity to assimilate a n d apply new knowledge.
Accordingly, we propose that there is a fourth
precondition for the creation of new intellectual
capital: combination capability. Even where the
opportunities for knowledge exchange a n d combination exist, these opportunities are perceived
a s valuable, a n d parties a r e motivated to make

<-----Page 9----->250

Academy of Management Review

such resource deployments or to e n g a g e in
knowing activity, the capability to combine information or experience must exist. In their research on innovation, Cohen a n d Levinthal
(1990) argue that the ability to recognize the
value of new knowledge a n d information, but
also to assimilate a n d use it, are all vital factors
in organizational learning a n d innovation. Their
work demonstrates that all of these abilities,
which they label "absorptive capacity," depend
upon the existence of related prior knowledge.
Moreover, they suggest that a n organization's
absorptive capacity does not reside in any single individual but depends, crucially, on the
links across a mosaic of individual capabilities-an
observation that parallels Spender's
(1996) discussion of collective knowledge.

Toward a Theory of the Creation of Intellectual
Capital
By way of summary, we have argued the following. First, new intellectual capital is created
through combination a n d exchange of existing
intellectual resources, which may exist in the
form of explicit a n d tacit knowledge a n d knowing capability. Second, there a r e four conditions
that affect the deployment of intellectual resources a n d engagement in knowing activity
involving combination a n d exchange. Third, in
reviewing the burgeoning literature on knowledge a n d knowing, we have encountered much
evidence in support of the view that the combination a n d exchange of knowledge a r e complex
social processes a n d that much valuable knowledge is fundamentally socially embedded-in
particular situations, in coactivity, a n d in relationships. As yet, we have uncovered no single
theoretical framework that pulls together the
various strands we can identify in this literature. For example, although a growing body of
work exists in which scholars adopt a n evolutionary perspective a n d identify the special capabilities of firms in the creation a n d transfer of
tacit knowledge, this work h a s not yet produced
a coherent theory explaining these special capabilities. Given the social embeddedness of
intellectual capital, we suggest that such a theory is likely to be one that is primarily concerned with social relationships. Accordingly,
we believe that social capital theory offers a
potentially valuable perspective for under-

April

standing a n d explaining the creation of intellectual capital. It is to this theory we now return.

SOCIAL CAPITAL. EXCHANGE, AND 

COMBINATION 

Social capital resides in relationships, a n d
relationships a r e created through exchange
(Bourdieu, 1986).The pattern of linkages a n d the
relationships built through them are the foundation for social capital. What we observe is a
complex and dialectical process in which social
capital is created a n d sustained through exchange a n d in which, in turn, social capital facilitates exchange. For example, there is mounting evidence demonstrating that where parties
trust each other, they are more willing to engage
in cooperative activity through which further
trust may be generated (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 1993; Tyler & Kramer, 1996). In social systems, exchange is the precursor to resource combination. Thus, social c a p i t a l influences
combination indirectly through exchange. However, we argue below that several facets of social capital, particularly those pertaining to the
cognitive dimension, also have a direct influence on the ability of individuals to combine
knowledge in the creation of intellectual capital.
Although our primary objective is to explore the
ways in which social capital influences the development of intellectual capital, we recognize
that intellectual capital may, itself, facilitate the
development of social capital. Thus, later in the
article we consider how the coevolution of these
two forms of capital may underpin organizationa l advantage.
The main thesis we develop here is that social
capital facilitates the development of intellectual capital by affecting the conditions necessary for exchange a n d combination to occur. To
explore this proposition, we now examine some
of the ways in which each of the three dimensions of social capital influences the four conditions for resource exchange a n d combination we
presented earlier. The specific relationships we
identify a r e summarized in Figure 1.
For the sake of clarity of exposition, we consider, in the following analysis, the impact of
each dimension of social capital independently
of the other dimensions. We recognize, however,
that both the dimensions a n d the several facets
of social capital a r e likely to be interrelated in
important a n d complex ways. For example, par-

titular structural configurations, such as those
displaying strong symmetrical ties, have consistently been shown to be associated with such
relational facets a s interpersonal affect a n d
trust (Granovetter, 1985; Krackhardt, 1992). Similarly, researchers have highlighted the oftencomplex interdependencies between social
identification a n d shared vocabulary a n d language (Ashforth & Mael, 1995).
Moreover, not all dimensions of social capital
a r e mutually reinforcing. For instance, a n efficient network in structural terms may not be the
best way to develop the strong relational or cognitive social capital that may be necessary to
ensure the effective operation of such networks.
Nohria a n d Eccles (1992),for example, highlight
important differences between face-to-face a n d

electronically mediated exchange to help create
a network organization requires more, not less,
face-to-face communication. Our primary focus
on the independent effects of these dimensions

therefore limits the richness of the present exploration a n d identifies a n important area for
future work.

Exchange, Combination. and the Structural
Dimension of Social Capital
Our main argument in this section is that,
within the context of the framework of combination a n d exchange adopted by us in this article,
the structural dimension of social capital influences the development of intellectual capital
primarily (though not exclusively) through the
ways in which its various facets affect access to
parties for exchanging knowledge a n d participating in knowing activities. While recognizing
that the structural facets also may be systematically associated with other conditions for the
exchange a n d combination of knowledge, we
believe that these associations a r e primarily derived indirectly, through the ways in which
structure influences the development of the re-

<-----Page 11----->252

Academy of Ma~nagementReview

lational a n d cognitive dimensions of social capital. For example, the strong, symmetrical ties
frequently associated with the development of
affective relationships (both positive a n d negative) may, in turn, influence individuals' motivation to engage in social interaction and, thereby,
exchange knowledge (Krackhardt, 1992; Lawler
& Yoon, 1996). Similarly, stable networks characterized by dense relations a n d high levels of
interaction are conducive to the development of
the different facets of the cognitive social capital we discuss in this article (Boisot, 1995; Orr,
1990).
Network ties. The fundamental proposition of
social capital theory is that network ties provide
access to resources. One of the central themes in
the literature is that social capital constitutes a
valuable source of information benefits (i.e.,
"who you know" affects "what you know").
Coleman (1988) notes that information is important in providing a basis for action but is costly
to gather. However, social relations, often established for other purposes, constitute information
channels that reduce the amount of time a n d
investment required to gather information.
Burt (1992) suggests that these information
benefits occur in three forms: access, timing,
a n d referrals. The term "access" refers to receiving a valuable piece of information a n d knowing who can use it, a n d it identifies the role of
networks in providing a n efficient informationscreening a n d -distribution process for members
of those networks. Thus, network ties influence
both access to parties for combining a n d exchanging knowledge (A1 in Figure 1) a n d anticipation of value through such exchange (A2 in
Figure 1).The operations of the invisible college
provide a n example of such networks.
"Timing" of information flows refers to the
ability of personal contacts to provide information sooner than it becomes available to people
without such contacts. This may well increase
the anticipated value of such information (A2 in
Figure 11, as demonstrated in research on jobseeking behavior (Granovetter, 1973).Such early
access to information may be especially important in commercially oriented research a n d development, where speed to market may be a
crucial factor in determining success.
"Referrals" a r e those processes providing information on available opportunities to people
or actors in the network, hence influencing the
opportunity to combine a n d exchange knowl-

edge (A1 in Figure 1). They constitute a flow of
information not only about possibilities but frequently include reputational endorsement for
the actors involved-thereby
influencing both
the anticipated value of combination a n d exchange a n d the motivation for such exchange
(see Granovetter, 1973, a n d Putnam, 1993). However, we believe that such reputational endorsement derives more from relational than structural factors, which we explore below.
Network configuration. Ties provide the channels for information transmission, but the overall configuration of these ties constitutes a n important facet of social capital that may impact
the development of intellectual capital. For example, three properties of network structuredensity, connectivity, a n d hierarchy-are
all
features associated with flexibility a n d ease of
information exchange through their impact on
the level of contact or the accessibility they provide to network members (A3 in Figure 1; Ibarra,
1992; Krackhardt, 1989).
Burt (1992) notes that a player with a network
rich in information benefits h a s contacts established in the places where useful bits of information are likely to air a n d who will provide a
reliable flow of information to a n d from those
places. While acknowledging the importance of
trust a n d trustworthiness a s a factor in the
choice of contacts, Burt (1992) devotes much
more attention to the efficiency of different relationship structures, arguing, in particular, that
the sparse network, with few redundant contacts, provides more information benefits. The
dense network is inefficient in the sense that it
returns less diverse information for the same
cost as that of the sparse network. The benefits
of the latter, thus, derive from both the diversity
of information a n d the lower costs of accessing
it.
Jacobs (1965) a n d Granovetter (1973) have
made similar arguments, identifying the role of
"hop-and-skip" links a n d "loose ties" in information diffusion through communities. This aspect
of diversity is very important, because it is well
established that significant progress in the creation of intellectual capital often occurs by
bringing together knowledge from disparate
sources a n d disciplines. Networks a n d network
structures, thus, represent facets of social capital that influence the range of information that
may be accessed (A3 in Figure 1) a n d that becomes available for combination. As such, these

<-----Page 12----->1998

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

structures constitute a valuable resource as
channels or conduits for knowledge diffusion
a n d transfer.
However, there are important limitations to
the conduit model, in which meaning is viewed
as unproblematic a n d in which the primary concern is with issues of information transfer. For
example, Hansen (1996)h a s found that weak ties
facilitate search but impede transfer, especially
when knowledge is not codified. Thus, whereas
networks having little redundancy may be both
effective a n d efficient for the transfer of information whose meaning is relatively unproblematic, much richer patterns of relationship a n d
interaction are important where the meaning of
information i s uncertain a n d ambiguous or
where parties to a n exchange differ in their prior
knowledge. For example, Cohen a n d Levinthal
(1990) have shown that some redundancy is necessary for the development of cross-functional
absorptive capacity. Nonetheless, the general
point remains that the configuration of the network is a n important influence on the accessibility of information resources (A3 in Figure 1).
although the appropriate level of redundancy is
contingent on the degree to which the parties to
knowledge exchange share a common knowledge base.
Appropriable organization. Social capital developed in one context, such as ties, norms, a n d
trust, can often (but not always) be transferred
from one social setting to another, thus influenci n g patterns of social exchange. Examples
include the transfer of trust from family a n d
religious affiliations into work s i t u a t i o n s
(Fukuyama, 1995). the development of personal
relationships into business exchanges (Coleman,
1990), a n d the aggregation of the social capital
of individuals into that of organizations (Burt,
1992). This suggests that organizations created
for one purpose may provide a source of valua b l e resources for other, different purposes
(Nohria, 1992; Putnam, 1993, 1995). Such appropriable social organization can provide a potential network of access to people a n d their resources, including information a n d knowledge
(A4 in Figure l), and, through its relational a n d
cognitive dimensions, may ensure motivation
a n d capability for exchange a n d combination
(see below). However, such organization also
may inhibit such processes; indeed, research
demonstrates how organizational routines may
separate rather than coordinate groups within

253

organizations, constraining rather than enabling learning a n d the creation of intellectual
capital (Dougherty, 1996; Hedberg, 1981).
Exchange. Combination. and the Cognitive
Dimension of Social Capital
Earlier in this article, we defined intellectual
capital a s the knowledge a n d knowing capability of a social collectivity. This reflects our belief
that, fundamentally, intellectual capital is a social artifact a n d that knowledge a n d meaning
are always embedded in a social context-both
created a n d sustained through ongoing relationships in such collectivities. Although schola r s widely recognize that innovation generally
occurs through combining different knowledge
a n d experience a n d that diversity of opinion is a
way of expanding knowledge, meaningful communication-an
essential part of social exchange a n d combination processes-requires at
least some sharing of context between the parties to such exchange (Boisot, 1995; Boland &
Tenkasi, 1995; Campbell, 1969). We suggest that
this sharing may come about in two main ways:
(1) through the existence of shared language
and vocabulary a n d (2) through the sharing of
collective narratives. Further, we suggest that
these two elements constitute facets of shared
cognition that facilitate the creation of intellectual capital especially through their impact on
combination capability. In each case they do so
by acting a s both a medium a n d a product of
social interaction.
Shared language and codes. There a r e several ways in which a shared language influences the conditions for combination a n d exc h a n g e . First, l a n g u a g e h a s a direct a n d
important function in social relations, for it is
the means by which people discuss a n d exchange information, ask questions, a n d conduct
business in society. To the extent that people
share a common language, this facilitates their
ability to gain access to people a n d their information. To the extent that their language a n d
codes a r e different, this keeps people apart a n d
restricts their access (B1 in Figure 1).
Second, language influences our perception
(Berger & Luckman, 1966; Pondy & Mitroff, 1979).
Codes organize sensory data into perceptual
categories a n d provide a frame of reference for
observing a n d interpreting our environment.
Thus, language filters out of awareness those

<-----Page 13----->254

Academy of Management Review

events for which terms do not exist in the language a n d filters in those activities for which
terms do exist. Shared language, therefore, may
provide a common conceptual apparatus for
evaluating the likely benefits of exchange a n d
combination (B2 in Figure 1).
Third, a shared language enhances combination capability (B3 in Figure 1). Knowledge a d vances through developing new concepts a n d
narrative forms (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).However, a s we noted previously, in order to develop
such concepts a n d to combine the information
gained through social exchange, the different
parties must have some overlap in knowledge.
Boland a n d Tenkasi (1995) identify the importance of both perspective taking a n d perspective making in knowledge creation, a n d they
demonstrate how the existence of a shared vocabulary enables the combining of information.
We suggest it is for all these reasons that researchers increasingly recognize group-specific
communication codes as a v a l u a b l e a s s e t
within firms (Arrow, 1974; Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Monteverde, 1995; Prescott & Visscher, 1980).
Shared narratives. Beyond the existence of
shared language a n d codes, researchers have
suggested that myths, stories, a n d metaphors
also provide powerful means in communities for
creating, exchanging, a n d preserving rich sets
of meanings-a view long held by some social
anthropologists (Clark, 1972; Nisbet, 1969). Recently, Bruner (1990) proposed that there a r e two
different modes of cognition: (1) the information
or paradigmatic mode a n d (2) the narrative
mode. The former suggests a process of knowledge creation rooted in rational analysis a n d
good arguments; the latter is represented in synthetic narratives, such as fairy tales, myths a n d
legends, good stories, a n d metaphors. According to Bateson (19721, metaphors cut across different contexts, thus enabling the combining of
both imaginative a n d literal observations a n d
cognitions. Orr (1990) demonstrates how narrative in the form of stories, full of seemingly insignificant details, facilitates the exchanging of
practice a n d tacit experience between technicians, thereby enabling the discovery a n d development of improved practice. The emergence
of shared narratives within a community thus
enables the creation a n d transfer of new interpretations of events, doing so in a way that
facilitates the combination of different forms of

April

knowledge, including those largely tacit (B4 in
Figure 1).
Exchange, Combination. and the Relational
Dimension of Social Capital

Much of the evidence for the relationship between social capital a n d intellectual capital
highlights the significance of the relational dimension of social capital. Szulanski (1996) h a s
found that one of the important barriers to the
transfer of best practice within organizations is
the existence of arduous relations between the
source a n d the recipient. Whereas we have argued that the structural dimension h a s its primary direct impact on the condition of accessibility, a n d the cognitive dimension through its
influence on accessibility a n d combination capability, research suggests that the relational
dimension of social capital influences three of
the conditions for exchange a n d combination in
many ways. These are access to parties for exchange, anticipation of value through exchange
a n d combination, a n d the motivation of parties
to engage in knowledge creation through exchange a n d combination.
Trust. Misztal defines trust a s the belief that
the "results of somebody's intended action will
be appropriate from our point of view" (1996:
9-10). A substantial body of research now exists
(Fukuyama, 1995; Gambetta, 1988; Putnam, 1993,
1995; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992, 1994; Tyler &
Kramer, 1996) that demonstrates where relationships a r e high in trust, people are more willing
to engage in social exchange in general, a n d
cooperative interaction in particular (C1 in Figure 1). Mishira (1996) argues that trust is multidimensional and indicates a willingness to be
vulnerable to another party-a willingness arising from confidence in four aspects: (1) belief in
the good intent a n d concern of exchange partners (Ouchi, 1981; Pascale, 1990; Ring & Van d e
Ven, 1994), (2) belief in their competence a n d
capability (Sako, 1992; Szulanski, 19961, (3) belief
in their reliability (Giddens, 1990; Ouchi, 1981),
a n d (4) belief in their perceived openness
(Ouchi, 1981).
Misztal observes that "trust, by keeping our
mind open to all evidence, secures communication a n d dialogue" (1996: 101, suggesting thereby
that trust may both open up access to people for
the exchange of intellectual capital (C3 in Figure 1) a n d i n c r e a s e anticipation of v a l u e

<-----Page 14----->1998

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

through such exchanges (C2 in Figure 1). One
can find support for this view in research demonstrating that where there a r e high levels of
trust, people a r e more willing to take risks in
such exchange (Nahapiet, 1996; Ring & Van d e
Ven, 1992). This may represent a n increased
willingness to experiment with combining different sorts of information. For example, Luhmann (1979) h a s shown trust to increase the potential of a system for coping with complexity
and, thus, diversity-factors known to be important in the development of new intellectual capital. Trust may also indicate greater openness to
the potential for value creation through exchange a n d combination (C2 in Figure 1).Boisot
highlights the importance of interpersonal trust
for knowledge creation in contexts of high ambiguity a n d uncertainty: "[Wlhen the message is
uncodified, trust h a s to reside in the quality of
the personal relationships that bind the parties
through shared values a n d expectations rather
than the intrinsic plausibility of the message"
(1995: 153).
As we noted earlier, there is a two-way interaction between trust a n d cooperation: trust lubricates cooperation, a n d cooperation itself
breeds trust. This may lead to the development,
over time, of generalized norms of cooperation,
which increase yet further the willingness to
engage in social exchange (Putnam, 1993). In
this respect, collective trust may become a
potent form of "expectational asset" (Knez &
Camerer, 1994) that group members can rely on
more generally to help solve problems of cooperation a n d coordination (Kramer, Brewer, &
Hanna, 1996).
Norms. According to Coleman (19901, a norm
exists when the socially defined right to control
a n action is held not by the actor but by others.
Thus, it represents a degree of consensus in the
social system. Coleman suggests that "where a
norm exists a n d is effective, it constitutes a powerful though sometimes fragile form of social
capital" (1988: S104). Norms of cooperation can
establish a strong foundation for the creation of
intellectual capital. Becoming, in effect, "expectations that bind" (Kramer & Goldman, 1995).
such norms may be a significant influence on
exchange processes, opening up access to parties for the exchange of knowledge (C4 in Figure
1) a n d ensuring the motivation to engage in
such exchange (C5 in Figure 1; Putnam, 1993).

255

For example, Starbuck (1992) notes the importance of social norms of openness a n d teamwork
as key features of knowledge-intensive firms; he
highlights the significance of the emphasis on
cooperation rather than competition, on open
disclosure of information, a n d on building loyalty to the firm as significant underpinnings of
the success of the American law firm Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen a n d Katz, which specializes in advice on nonroutine, challenging cases. Other
norms of interaction that have been shown to be
important in the creation of intellectual capital
include a willingness to value a n d respond to
diversity, a n openness to criticism, a n d a tolera n c e of failure (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Such
norms may offset the tendency to "groupthink"
that may emerge in strong, convergent groups
a n d that represents the way in which high levels of social capital may be a real inhibitor for
the development of intellectual capital (Janis,
1982).At the same time, as Leonard-Barton (1995)
h a s shown, norms also may have a dark side;
those capabilities a n d values initially seen a s
a benefit may become, in time, a pathological
rigidity.
Obligations and expectations. Obligations
represent a commitment or duty to undertake
some activity in the future. Coleman (1990) distinguishes obligations from generalized norms,
viewing the former a s expectations developed
within particular personal relationships. He
suggests that obligations operate a s a "credit
slip" held by A to be redeemed by some performance by B-a view reminiscent of Bourdieu's
(1986)concept of credential we referred to earlier
in this article. In the context of the creation of
intellectual capital, we suggest that such obligations a n d expectations are likely to influence
both access to parties for exchanging a n d combining knowledge (C6 in Figure 1) a n d the motivation to combine a n d exchange such knowledge (C7 in Figure 1).The notion that "there is no
such thing a s a free lunch" represents a commonly held view that exchange brings with it
expectations about future obligations-a view
explicated in detail by Mauss (1954). Bourdieu
(19771, a n d Cheal (1988). Fairtlough (1994) a s cribes considerable importance to the formal,
professional, a n d personal obligations that develop between those involved in cooperative research a n d development projects between different organizations:

People in the two companies could rely on each
o t h e r . . . . This w a s cooperation which certainly
went beyond contractual obligations. It might
a l s o have gone beyond enlightened self interest,
a n d beyond good professional behaviour, bec a u s e the scientists liked working together, felt
committed to the overall project a n d felt a personal obligation to help the others involved (1994:
119).

Identification. Identification i s the process
whereby individuals s e e themselves a s one
with another person or group of people. This
may result from their membership in that group
or through the group's operation as a reference
group, "in which the individual takes the values
or standards of other individuals or groups as a
comparative frame of reference" (Merton, 1968:
288; see also Tajfel, 1982). Kramer et al. (1996)
have found that identification with a group or
collective enhances concern for collective proc e s s e s a n d outcomes, t h u s increasing t h e
chances that the opportunity for exchange will
be recognized. Identification, therefore, acts as a
resource influencing both the anticipation of
value to be achieved through combination a n d
exchange (C8 in Figure 1) a n d the motivation to
combine a n d exchange knowledge (C9 in Figure
1). We find support for this in the research of
Lewicki a n d Bunker (1996),whose evidence suggests that salient group identification may not
only increase the perceived opportunities for exchange but also may enhance the actual frequency of cooperation. In contrast, where groups
have distinct a n d contradictory identities, these
may constitute significant barriers to information sharing, learning, a n d knowledge creation
(Child & Rodrigues, 1996; Pettigrew, 1973; Simon
& Davies, 1996).
Thus far, we have argued that social capital
theory provides a powerful basis for understanding the creation of intellectual capital in
general. The various specific links we have proposed are summarized in Figure 1. In the next
section we suggest that the theory also provides
a basis for understanding the nature of organizational advantage since firms, a s institutions,
a r e likely to be relatively well endowed with
social capital.
SOCIAL CAPITAL, INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL,
AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL ADVANTAGE
The last 20 years have witnessed a substantial resurgence of interest in the theory of the

April

firm. During this period, those espousing transaction cost approaches became increasingly influential, positing, at their simplest, that the existence of firms can be explained in terms of
market failure a n d the greater ability of firms,
through hierarchy, to reduce the costs of transactions in particular (and relatively restricted)
circumstances (Williamson, 1975, 1981, 1985).The
transaction cost theory of the firm h a s proved
robust a n d h a s been applied across a wide
range of issues, but it h a s also become subject to
growing criticism for a range of definitional,
methodological, a n d substantive reasons (see,
for example, Conner & Prahalad, 1996, a n d Pitelis, 1993). More fundamentally, as we noted at
the outset of this article, researchers now a r e
seeking to develop a theory of the firm that is
expressed in positive terms (Kogut & Zander,
1996; Masten, Meehan, & Snyder, 1991; Simon,
199lb)-away from a market-failure framework
to one grounded in the concept of organizational
advantage (Moran & Ghoshal, 1996).
Increasingly, the special capabilities of organizations for creating a n d transferring knowledge
a r e being identified a s a central element of organizational advantage. We suggest that social
capital theory provides a sound basis for explaining why this should be the case. First, organizations a s institutional settings a r e characterized by many of the factors known to be
conducive to the development of high levels of
social capital. Second, it is the coevolution of
social a n d intellectual capital that underpins
organizational advantage.
Organizations a s Institutional Settings Are
Conducive to the Development of Social
Capital
Social capital is owned jointly by the parties
to a relationship, with no exclusive ownership
rights for individuals. Thus, it is fundamentally
concerned with resources located within structures a n d processes of social exchange; as such,
the development of social capital is significantly affected by those factors shaping the evolution of social relationships. We discuss four
such conditions here: time, interaction, interdependence, a n d closure. We argue that all four
a r e more characteristic of internal organization
than of market organization as represented in
neoclassical theory a n d that, a s a result, organizations as institutional settings are conducive

<-----Page 16----->1998

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

to the development of high levels of social capital relative to markets. However, a s we subsequently note, in practice these conditions may
also occur in some forms of interorganizational
networks, thereby enabling such networks to
become relatively well endowed with social
capital.
Time and the development of social capital.
Like other forms of capital, social capital constitutes a form of accumulated history-here reflecting investments in social relations a n d social organization through time (Bourdieu, 1986;
Granovetter, 1992). Time is important for the development of social capital, since all forms of
social capital depend on stability a n d continuity
of the social structure. The concept of embedding fundamentally means the binding of social
relations in contexts of time a n d space (Giddens, 1990). Coleman highlights the importance
of continuity in social relationships:
One way in which the transactions that make up
social action differ from those of the classical
model of a perfect market lie in the role of time. In
a model of a perfect market, transactions a r e both
costless a n d instantaneous. But in the real world,
transactions a r e consummated over a period of
time (1990: 91).

For example, since it takes time to build trust,
relationship stability a n d durability a r e key network features associated with high levels of
trust a n d norms of cooperation (Axelrod, 1984;
Granovetter, 1985; Putnam, 1993; Ring & Van d e
Ven, 1992). The duration a n d stability of social
relations also influence the clarity a n d visibility
of mutual obligations (Misztal, 1996).
Although, in the main, social capital is created as a by-product of activities engaged in for
other purposes, intentional or constructed organization represents a direct, purposeful investment in social capital (Coleman, 1990, 1993).
"These organizations ordinarily take the form of
authority structures composed of positions connected by obligations a n d expectations a n d
occupied by persons" (Coleman 1990: 313). In
contrast to the short-term transactions characterizing the markets of neoclassical theory, intentional or constructed organization represents
the creation a n d maintenance of a n explicit a n d
enduring structure of ties constituting, through
organizational design, a configuration of relationships a n d resources usable for a variety of
purposes-both formal a n d informal. Moreover,
this commitment to continuity facilitates the

257

other processes known to be influential in the
development of social capital: interdependence,
interaction, a n d closure.
Interdependence and the development of social capital. Coleman (1990) states that social
capital is eroded by factors that make people
less dependent upon each other. This appears
especially so for the relational dimension of social capital. For example, expectations a n d obligations are less significant where people have
alternative sources of support. Indeed, Misztal
(1996) h a s suggested that the recent resurgence
of interest in trust can be explained by the increasingly transitional character of our present
condition a n d the erosion of social interdependence a n d solidarity. Yet, most authors agree
that high levels of social capital usually are
developed in contexts characterized by high levels of mutual interdependence.
Whereas markets a s institutional arrangements are rooted in the concept of autonomy
(and institutional economists largely neglect interdependence between exchange parties; Zajac
& Olsen, 1993), firms fundamentally a r e institutions designed around the concepts a n d practices of specialization a n d interdependence a n d
differentiation a n d integration (Lawrence &
Lorsch, 1967; Smith, 1986; Thompson, 1967).Interdependence-and the coordination it implieslong h a s been recognized as perhaps the key
attribute of business organization (Barnard,
1938). Follet goes so far as to suggest that
the fair test of business administration, of industrial organization, is whether you have a business with all its parts so co-ordinated, so moving
together in their closely knit a n d adjusting activities, so linking, interlocking a n d inter-relating,
that they make a working unit, not a congerie of
separate pieces (1949: 61).

Such interdependence provides the stimulus for
developing many organizationally embedded
forms of social capital. For example, through
providing the opportunity to create contexts
characterized by the condition of interdependent viability-that is, the requirement that exchanges a r e positive in outcome for the system
overall rather than for each individual member
of the system-organizations considerably extend the circle of exchange that takes place
among their members (Coleman, 1993; Moran &
Ghoshal, 1996),thereby increasing social identification a n d encouraging norms of cooperation
a n d risk taking.

<-----Page 17----->258

Interaction and the development of social
capital. Social relationships generally, though
not always, a r e strengthened through interaction but die out if not maintained. Unlike many
other forms of capital, social capital increases
rather than decreases with use. Interaction,
thus, is a precondition for the development
a n d m a i n t e n a n c e of d e n s e social c a p i t a l
(Bourdieu, 1986). In particular, as w e noted a l ready, scholars have shown that the cognitive
a n d relational dimensions of social capital accumulate in network structures where linka g e s a r e strong, multidimensional, a n d reciprocal-features
that characterize many firms
but that rarely surface in pure market forms of
organization. Discussing the development of
language, Boland a n d Tenkasi note that it is
"through action within communities of knowing that we make a n d remake both our lang u a g e a n d our knowledge" (1995: 353). According to these authors, such communities must
have space for conversation, action, a n d interaction in order for the codes a n d language to
develop that facilitate the creation of new intellectual capital.
In a different context Boissevain (1974) shows
how multiplex relations are more intimate than
single-stranded relationships, therefore providing more accessibility a n d more response to
pressure than single-stranded relations. Such
relations typically are imbued with higher levels of obligation between network members, as
well as trust-based norms (Coleman, 1990). Further, Powell (1996) argues that norm-based conceptions of trust miss the extent to which cooperation i s buttressed by sustained contact,
regular dialogue, a n d constant monitoring. He
a d d s that, without mechanisms a n d institutions
to sustain such conversations, trust does not ens u e (see also Coleman, 1990). This echoes Bourdieu's earlier emphasis on the fundamental
need for "an unceasing effort of sociability"
(1986: 250) for the reproduction of social capital
in its many forms.
In neoclassical theory, markets a s institutional settings a r e epitomized by impersonal,
arm's length, spot transactions. Firms, in contrast, provide many opportunities for sustained
interaction, conversations, a n d sociabilityboth by design a n d by accident. Formal organizations explicitly a r e designed to bring members together in order to undertake their primary
task, to supervise activities, a n d to coordinate

April

their activities, particularly in contexts requiring mutual adjustment (Mintzberg, 1979; Thompson, 1967), change, a n d innovation (Burns &
Stalker, 1961; Galbraith, 1973). Through copresence (Giddens, 1984), colocation (Fairtlough,
1994),a n d the creation of such processes a s routine choice opportunities (March & Olsen, 1976),
organizations also create a myriad of contexts
a n d occasions for the more-or-less planned coming together of people a n d their ideas. Finally,
the literature is replete with evidence that organizational life is characterized by a substantial amount of conversation: in meetings, conferences, a n d social events that fill the everyday
life of workers a n d managers (Mintzberg, 1973;
Prescott & Visscher, 1980; Roy, 1960). Together,
these can be viewed a s collective investment
strategies for the institutional creation a n d
maintenance of dense networks of social relationships a n d for the resources embedded
within, available through, a n d derived from
such networks of relationships. Alternatively,
these meetings a n d social events provide the
unplanned a n d unstructured opportunities for
the accidental coming together of ideas that
may lead to the serendipitous development of
new intellectual capital.
Closure and the development of social capital. Finally, there is much evidence that closure is a feature of social relationships that is
conducive to the development of high levels of
relational a n d cognitive social capital. Strong
communities-the epitome of systems of dense
social capital-have "identities that separate
a n d a s e n s e of sociological boundary that distinguishes members from nonmembers" (Etzioni, 1996: 9; s e e also Bourdieu, 1986). The development of norms, identity, a n d trust h a s
been shown to be facilitated by network closure (Coleman, 1990; Ibarra, 1992), a n d the development of unique codes a n d language is
assisted by the existence of community s e p a ration (Boland & Tenkasi, 1995). Formal organizations, by definition, imply a measure of closure through the creation of explicit legal,
financial, a n d social boundaries (Kogut &
Zander, 1996). Markets, in contrast, represent
open networks that benefit from the freedom
offered to individual agents but that have less
access to the relational a n d cognitive facets of
social capital.

The Coevolution of Social and Intellectual
Capital Underpins Organizational Advantage
Our main argument thus far h a s been that
social capital is influential in the development
of new intellectual capital a n d that organizations a r e institutional settings conducive to the
development of social capital. We have noted
the significant a n d growing body of work that
indicates organizations have some particular
capabilities for creating a n d sharing knowledge, giving them their distinctive advantage
over other institutional arrangements, such as
markets. We now pull the strands of our analysis together by proposing that it is the interaction between social a n d intellectual capital that
underpins organizational advantage.
Although our primary aim h a s been to suggest
that social capital influences the development
of intellectual capital, we recognize that the pattern of influence may be in the other direction.
The view that shared knowledge forms the basis
from which social order a n d interaction flow is a
central theme in sociology, exemplified in the
work of Berger a n d Luckman (1966) a n d Schutz
(1970). Within organizational analysis, authors
long have suggested that the firm's particular
knowledge about how activities a r e to be coordinated underpins its capability to develop a n d
operate as a social system (Kogut & Zander,
1992, 1996; March & Simon, 1958: Penrose, 1959;
Thompson, 1967). We represent the influence of
intellectual capital on social capital as a feedback relationship in Figure 1. More important,
however, we believe that it is the coevolution of
social a n d intellectual capital that is of particular significance in explaining the source of organizational advantage.
Earlier in the article we noted the dialectical
process by which social capital is both created
a n d sustained through exchange and, in turn,
enables such exchange to take place. As Berger
a n d Luckman observe,
The relationship between man, the producer, a n d
the social world, his product, is a n d remains a
dialectical one. That is, m a n (not, of course, in
isolation but in his collectivities) a n d his social
world interact with each other. The product acts
back upon the producer (1966: 78; s e e also Bourdieu, 1977).

Giddens, too, examines the self-reproducing
quality of social practices, noting that social
activities a r e recursive-that
is, "continually

259

recreated by actors via the very means by which 

they express themselves as actors" (1984: 2). For 

Giddens this implies a concept of human knowledgeability that underpins all social practice.
The discussion of knowledgeability that ensues suggests the reciprocal quality of the relationship between social a n d intellectual capital
a n d is consistent with our emphasis on the social embeddedness of both forms of capital.
Since both social a n d intellectual capital develop within a n d derive their significance from
the social activities a n d social relationships
within which they a r e located, their evolutionary paths are likely to be highly interrelated.
Consideration of the reciprocal relationship
between knowledge a n d its social context permeates the sociology of science (Zuckerman,
1988). Mullins (1973), for example, describes the
joint evolution of social interaction, communication networks, a n d the elaboration of scientific
ideas a n d notes that cognitive development is
facilitated by the thickening of communication
networks, which then leads to their further elaboration. Research within organizations offers
many parallel examples (Burns & Stalker, 1961;
Leonard-Barton, 1995: Weick, 1995; Zucker et al.,
1996). For instance, in a study of change in
health administration, Nahapiet (1988) d e scribes, in detail, how a new accounting calculus both shaped a n d was, in turn, shaped by the
social context in which it was embedded.
Discussing Orr's (1990) influential ethnography of service technicians, Brown a n d Duguid
(1991) provide further insight into this coevolution of knowledge a n d relationships. Specifically, they describe how technicians achieve
two distinct forms of social construction. First,
through their work, a n d "through cultivating
connections throughout the corporation" (Brown
& Duguid, 1991: 67), technicians engage in the
ongoing creation a n d negotiation of shared understanding-an understanding that represents
their view of the world, that is their collective
knowledge. The second form of social construction, which, according to Brown a n d Duguid, is
also important but less evident, is the creation of
a shared identity. "In telling these stories a n
individual rep contributes to the construction
a n d development of his or her own identity as a
rep a n d reciprocally to the construction a n d development of the community of reps in which he
or she works" (Brown & Duguid, 1991: 68). In a n
analysis reminiscent of Weick a n d Roberts'

<-----Page 19----->260

Academy of Manlagement Review

(1993) discussion of collective mind-itself
located in processes of interrelating-these authors highlight the mutually dependent a n d interactive ways in which social a n d intellectual
capital coevolve.
We suggest that this emphasis on the coevolution of the two forms of capital provides a
dynamic perspective on the development of organizational advantage. Spender (1996) argues
that it is the collective forms of knowledge that
are strategically important, a n d many authors
claim that it is these forms of shared tacit knowledge that underpin what we have termed the
"organizational advantage." It is these collective forms of knowledge, we believe, that are
particularly tightly interconnected with the relational a n d cognitive forms of social capital with
which, we have argued, organizations are relatively well endowed. Organizations, thus, build
a n d retain their advantage through the dynamic
a n d complex interrelationships between social
a n d intellectual capital.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
The view of organizational advantage we
present here is fundamentally a social one. We
see the roots of intellectual capital deeply embedded in social relations a n d in the structure of
these relations. Such a view contrasts strongly
with the relatively individualistic a n d acontextual perspectives that characterize more transactional approaches for explaining the existence a n d contribution of firms. Although we
have identified several ways in which facets of
social capital may, indeed, reduce transaction
costs by economizing on information a n d coordination costs, we believe that our theoretical
propositions g o much farther in identifying
those factors underpinning dynamic efficiency
a n d growth.
In so doing, we note that our arguments a r e
consistent with resource-based theory in so far
a s that theory highlights the competitive advantage of firms as based in their unique constellation of resources: physical, human, a n d organizational (Barney, 1991).Those resources found to
be especially valuable are those that a r e rare,
durable, imperfectly imitable, a n d nontradable
(Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989).Among the
factors making a resource nonimitable a r e tacitness (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990),causal ambiguity (Lippman & Rumelt, 1992), time compression

April

diseconomies, a n d interconnectedness (Dierickx
& Cool, 1989), as well a s path dependence
a n d social complexity (Barney, 1991; Reed &
DeFillippi, 1990). All of these are features integral to the facets of social capital a n d to its
interrelationships with intellectual capital.
Thus, w e suggest that differences between
firms, including differences in performance,
may represent differences in their ability to crea t e a n d exploit social capital. Moreover, at least
regarding the development of intellectual capital, those firms developing particular configurations of social capital a r e likely to be more successful. Evidence for this suggestion is found in
studies of knowledge-intensive firms that have
been shown to invest heavily in resources, including physical facilities, to encourage the development of strong personal a n d team relationships, high levels of personal trust, norm-based
control, a n d strong connections across porous
boundaries (Alvesson, 1991, 1992; Starbuck, 1992,
1994; Van Maanen & Kunda, 1989). The framework developed here will provide a useful basis
for further testing these propositions about firm
differences.
In developing our thesis, we have noted several limitations in our approach. First, regarding
social capital, our analysis h a s concentrated
primarily, although not exclusively, on how social capital assists the creation of new intellectual capital. However, we recognize that social
capital also may have significant negative consequences. For example, certain norms may be
antagonistic rather than supportive of cooperation, exchange, a n d change. Moreover, organizations high in social capital may become ossified through their relatively restricted access to
diverse sources of ideas and information. But
the general point underpinning our analysis is
that institutions facilitate some forms of exchange a n d combination but limit their scope
(Ghoshal & Moran, 1996);thus, effective organization requires a constant balancing of potentially opposing forces (Boland & Tenkasi, 1995;
Etzioni, 1996; Leonard-Barton, 1995).
Furthermore, the creation a n d maintenance of
some forms of social capital, particularly the
relational a n d cognitive dimensions, a r e costly.
The development of social capital thus repreor
sents a significant investment-conscious
unconscious-and, like all such investments, requires a n understanding of the relative costs
a n d benefits likely to be derived from such in-

<-----Page 20----->1998

Nahapiet and Ghoshal

vestment. These a r e likely to be influenced by
the size a n d complexity of the social structure in
which social capital is embedded, since the
costs of maintaining linkages usually increase
exponentially as a social network increases in
size. Although technology may make it possible
to stretch the conventional limits of networks of
social capital, our arguments about the significance of interdependence, interaction, a n d closure suggest that there still remain important
upper limits. Indeed, adding people to the network may serve to reduce certain forms of social
capital, such as personal obligations or high
status.
Finally, although we have responded to Putnam's challenge to progress our understanding
of the various dimensions a n d facets of social
capital, in our analysis we largely have considered these dimensions separately. Of great interest is the interrelationships among the three
dimensions and, indeed, among the various facets within each dimension. We regard this a s a n
important focus for future research.
Second, regarding intellectual capital, we
have concentrated on just one aspect: its creation, rather than its diffusion a n d exploitation.
A fuller understanding of knowledge a s the
source of organizational advantage will require
a n examination of the ways in which social capital may influence these important a n d complementary processes. We believe that the framework we develop here provides a sound basis
for such examination. Also, we have focused
very much on the types a n d processes of intellectual capital rather than its content-that is,
the know-how rather t h a n the know-what.
Clearly, the specific knowledge content, including its quality, a r e important factors to be considered when attempting to gain a n understanding of the effective creation of intellectual
capital.
Third, our exploration of organizational a d vantage began with the proposition that knowledge a n d knowledge processes a r e major found a t i o n s of s u c h a d v a n t a g e . However, our
discussion of the coevolution of social a n d intellectual capital potentially enriches this understanding of organizational advantage in important ways. For instance, our analysis elucidates
resource creation within networks, concentrating particularly on the interrelated development
of social a n d intellectual capital a s key resources. As such, it is suggestive of the pro-

26 1

cesses whereby organizational networks create
value and that, perhaps, underpin their advantage. More generally, we believe that a detailed
understanding of social capital itself may be a n
important element in extending our understanding of the significant, but as yet inadequately
understood, concept of organizational advantage. However, we could not explore such issues
in this article, a n d we recognize that much work
still needs to be done to elaborate both the concept of organizational advantage a n d the significance of social capital therein.
Fourth a n d finally, we have developed our
thesis about the relationships between social
a n d intellectual capital in the context of exploring a n d explaining the source of organizational
advantage-that
is, we have made the argument regarding these interrelationships within
one type of boundary: the firm. It is our view that
structures of social capital fundamentally are
relatively bounded, a n d these boundaries typically come from some external physical or social basis for grouping, such a s a geographic
community (Jacobs, 1965; Putnam, 1993), the
family (Coleman, 1988; Loury, 1977), religion
(Coleman, 1990),or class (Bourdieu, 1977).As we
noted earlier, social capital is typically a byproduct of other activities; thus, its development
requires a "focus": a n entity around which joint
activities are organized (Nohria, 1992)a n d which
forms the basis for a level of network closure.
However, our analysis of the conditions conducive to the development of social capital suggests that wherever institutions operate in contexts characterized by enduring relationshipswith relatively high levels of interdependence,
interaction, a n d closure-we would expect to
s e e these institutions emerge with relatively
dense configurations of social capital. We have
argued that these conditions typically occur
more within organizations than in neoclassical
markets, but they may also be found in particular forms of interorganizational relationship
(Baker, 1990; Hakansson & Snehota, 1995; Larson,
1992; Powell, 1996; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992,
1994). Therefore, we see the potential to extend
our fundamental analysis to other institutional
settings, including those existing between
organizations.
Bourdieu (1993) argues that, by making the
concept of social capital explicit, it is possible to
focus rigorously on the intuitively important
concept of "connections" a n d to establish the

<-----Page 21----->262

Academy of Management Review

basis for research designed to identify the processes for social capital's creation, accumulation, dissipation, a n d consequence. The concept
also provides a theoretical justification for the
study of many social practices, such as the "social round," popularly recognized as important
but frequently ignored in formal research. In
particular, for Bourdieu, systematic analysis of
the volume a n d structure of social capital enables examination of the relationships between
social a n d other forms of capital.
In identifying the interrelationship between
social a n d intellectual capital, we have made a
similar argument. That is, by defining the concepts a n d developing clear propositions about
their interrelationships, we have established a n
agenda for future research that both complements a n d extends existing knowledge-based
theories of the firm. Moreover, we suggest that
the model outlined here also provides the foundation of a viable framework to guide the investments-individual or collective-of
practitioners seeking to build or extend their network of
connections and, therefore, their stocks of social
capital. As Bourdieu observes, "[Tlhe existence
of connections is not a natural given, or even a
social given. . . it is the product of a n endless
effort at institution" (1986: 249).
