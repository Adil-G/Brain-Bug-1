Abstract
Entrepreneurship is the engine of innovation. The accumulated tacit knowledge and culture of the entrepreneur are the resources
essential to create wealth from research commercialisation leading to technological innovation and the creation of New Technology
Based Firms (NTBFs). The authors explore, in definitional terms, discovery of entrepreneurial opportunity and entrepreneurial
capacity as the essential elements in the interaction between all types of tacit knowledge (technological, managerial, risk management, financial, etc.). These both derive from and affect interactions between the institutions (sets of rules), organisational culture
and external business environment. They also interact with the entrepreneur’s own background and personality. This leads then to
a wider analysis of the importance of such tacit knowledge as the glue bringing together effective mechanisms for wealth creation
out of research commercialisation.

1. Introduction: mapping a complex territory
Lundvall (1992) identified three important characteristics of national innovation systems: the generation of
new knowledge, the absorptive capacity or ability
(closely related to business R&D investment) (Yencken
and Gillin, 2002a) to exploit this knowledge and an
external environment that is not prejudicial to innovation. This paper is focussed on the absorptive capacity
of an innovation system, particularly that part of it that
derives from tacit knowledge of various types involved
in the development of new NTBFs. For countries like
Australia with low levels of technology absorptive
capacity (directly related to business R&D expenditure
per employee) but with many highly creative research
groups, high-tech start-ups have been shown to have
much higher R&D expenditure per employee than existing businesses and thus make a proportionally greater
contribution to technology absorptive capacity (Yencken
and Gillin, 2002a).
It is unfortunate that three phenomena of central

importance to economic and social development can still
be seriously discussed and researched in a definitional
haze. It is uncontroversial that research commercialisation, entrepreneurship and technological innovation are
closely linked phenomena that are vital to the creation
and maintenance of national wealth. What is controversial is the precise nature of the relationship between
these three phenomena. This paper seeks to resolve some
of the confusion, which may exist, by careful definition
leading to effective conceptual integration. As such, it
is the first stage of a longitudinal qualitative research
study that will involve grounded theory based case studies (Yin, 1994; Strauss and Corbin, 1990) of early stage
public research spin-off companies established in Australia in the years 1998–2000. For this larger study, it
has been particularly important to understand resource
based theory applied to entrepreneurship (Alvarez and
Busenitz, 2001) with knowledge the critical resource.
The paper also explores the nature of the knowledge
inputs (prior, background and new intellectual property,
codified and tacit knowledge) and the entrepreneurship
capacity inputs involved in the process of technological
innovation through the spin-off company as a commercialisation channel for university and other public
research agency research outcomes.
The paper first discusses definitions relating to inno-

vation and entrepreneurship relevant to the discussion of
research commercialisation leading to New Technology
Based
Firms
(NTBFs).
It
then
discusses
entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial capacity and other
resource inputs into the research commercialisation processes and technological innovation. This is followed by
an analysis of the various types of public research
agency spin-off ventures. Finally it proposes an integrated model for the analysis of knowledge and entrepreneurial inputs in the early stage development of NBTFs
spun-off from public research agencies.

2. The innovation domain
In the recent Australian Yellow Pages Special Innovation Report (Yencken et al., 2001), innovation was
defined as taking up and converting new ideas into a
commercial market success. Innovation narrowly defined
can of course also involve commercial failure. Catherine
Livingstone in the Warren Centre Innovation Lecture
2000 further developed the definition:
I will interpret (successful) innovation as meaning the
process whereby ‘new ideas are transformed, through
economic activity, into a sustainable value-creating
outcome’. There are two key words in this interpretation which are worthy of emphasis: ‘process’: innovation is not just the idea—innovation is only achieved when the idea has been transferred into an
outcome which has value…The second key word is
‘sustainable’:.. Sustainability requires good integration with those who assign value i.e. the customers, the market, and it implies rigour and continuous measurement (Livingstone, 2000).
Gurr (2001) recently quoted 3M’s shorter definition as:
An Idea—Applied—To Create Benefit.
It is important to distinguish early on between smalli and large-I innovation. Much of the public policy effort
in Australia appears to be overly focused on small-i
innovation—that is synonymous in this interpretation
with invention and is all, and only, about newness. The
extension to generating commercial success is lost. Fig.
1 illustrates this difference between small-I innovation
and Large-I innovation. This figure shows the central
importance of entrepreneurship as the engine of innovation (Drucker, 2002, p. 1). This issue has been
developed further by Hindle (2002).
For the technological innovation that results from the
commercial exploitation of new knowledge, the ultimate
objective is wealth creation, whether it be through the
creation of a new business entity or by the establishment
of a new venture within an existing company. The
exploitation of such new knowledge leading to discovery

of a commercial opportunity essentially changes the production function (Schumpeter, 1939, pp. 87 and 94).
2.1. Knowledge inputs
The links to be explored include knowledge resources
derived from entrepreneurial capacity, new knowledge
that may be codified in the various forms of intellectual
property and a range of other knowledge inputs that may
be codified or tacit. Other codified knowledge will
include the disciplinary learning of the inventor and the
management and entrepreneurship training of the
manager/entrepreneur. The tacit knowledge brought in
by the various players starts with the technological
understanding of the inventor/technologist in relation to
the development of the specific new knowledge or technology being commercialised. To this has to be added
entrepreneurial capacity, that is the experience and skills
of the entrepreneur (whether home-grown or recruited
from outside), both as a manager of new technological
ventures and possibly also from his familiarity with the
business sector in which the venture will operate.
Vohora et al. (2002) identify the imported CEO as a
surrogate entrepreneur. The inventor, in many NTBFs,
will also be the initial entrepreneur or technology champion, but will often be replaced by an externally recruited
Chief Executive Officer, or surrogate entrepreneur.
Experience has shown that a research scientist without
entrepreneurship training and experience, while competent to be the initial technology champion, is often not
well suited to the entrepreneur or jockey role needed to
drive the NTBF forward (Daniels and Hofer, 1993; Venkataraman et al., 1992; Samsom and Gurdon, 1993).

3. Definitional problems of the word
‘entrepreneurship’
3.1. An historic ‘split personality’
Of French derivation, the word ‘entrepreneur’ literally
means an ‘in-between taker’; someone who gets ‘in
between’ a supplier and a market and takes a profit
by facilitating the exchange process. Positive connotations revolve around the concept of ‘making it happen’. In this perspective, the entrepreneur can be seen
as a creator: one who turns a potential exchange into
an actual exchange, one without whom the transaction
may never occur. Extrapolating, in the case where the
demand exists but the supply does not, the entrepreneur may actually create the supply as well as effect
the exchange. In the specific case of the exploitation
of new technological assets and platform or disruptive
technologies, the entrepreneur may even have to create a market where none exists. There are also negative connotations. Such a person may be construed in
some minds as a mere ‘middleman’ or worse, someone who takes an ‘unearned’ profit by actually
obstructing the ‘natural’ process of exchange by
inserting him or herself into the channels of distribution and actually distorting an efficient flow from
producer to consumer. This was well recognized by
Laurie Cox, the Chairman of the Australian Stock
Exchange Limited, in his foreword to Hartwell and
Lane’s history of Australian entrepreneurship.
(Hartwell and Lane, 1989).
Fortunately, there has been, in the entrepreneurship
literature, an emerging concensus about at least the
ingredients that any comprehensive and useful definition
of entrepreneurship should encompass. They are as follows:
앫 creation of a new organisation to pursue an opportunity (Bygrave and Hofer, 1991; Gartner, 1989),
앫 innovation management (Schumpeter, 1934, 1939,
1942),
앫 speculation and risk bearing (Cantillon 1775—quoted
in Jennings, 1994: 42–43),
앫 coordination of disparate elements (Say 1828—cited
in Koolman, 1971),
앫 decision making in an uncertain environment
(Knight, 1921),
앫 leadership (Marshall, 1949),
앫 arbitrage (Kirzner, 1973),
앫 product development and ownership (Hawley—discussed in Jennings, 1994: 56–57), and
앫 a focus on managing rapid growth in a volatile
environment (Legge and Hindle, 1997).
Entrepreneurs have been seen as participating in a com-

795

plex, plural and interactive network (Jennings, 1994: op.
cit.), embracing ‘all’ or most of the above concepts in
complex interaction. The proportions of these ingredients will vary from case to case and context to context.
One entrepreneurial situation may, for instance, involve
a high level of risk management and a low degree of
organisation building. Another may involve high levels
of leadership and low levels of arbitrage. The same fundamental ingredients, mixed according to different
recipes, can be used to bake many dishes.
As indicated in the introduction, this paper has
focussed on the particular recipes for entrepreneurship
and the entrepreneurial capacity and tacit knowledge
inputs needed to achieve successful innovation in the
early stage development of NTBF spin-offs in the commercialisation of public, particularly university, research.
The literature has suggested that the concept of
entrepreneurship is holistic. However, we will argue that
the need for and nature of entrepreneurial capacity inputs
will be different for the different phases of a new venture’s development.

4. Research commercialisation and technological
innovation
4.1. Research strategies
The manager of a company’s industrial research group
has traditionally seen the research process as starting
from an identified problem or market need that is potentially solvable by research and its subsequent development and application—essentially a linear market driven
process. Smith and Barfield (1996, p. 1) however have
commented that “classification schemes that describe the
innovation process as a straight line progression fail to
capture its essential messiness and serendipitous nature”.
For new knowledge arising from basic research, the
more complex model of Lee and Gaertner (1994) (Fig.
2) may be more relevant.
Recent R&D management literature distinguishes four
types, or what is known in the literature as generations
of R&D strategies (Liyanage and Greenfield, 1999;
Miller and Morris, 1999; Niosi, 1999):
Ist generation R&D is the unbounded search for
scientific breakthroughs…2nd generation R&D shifts
the focus to applicability (in the market place) using
project management… while 3rd generation R&D
uses surveys to establish existing customers’ needs
to create products and services to fulfil those needs.
Constrained by the inherent limits of explicit market
knowledge, however, 3rd generation R&D is predominantly occupied with continuous innovation
(Miller and Morris, 1999).

In the mid-1980s, a fourth stage or ‘generation’ of R&D
strategies arrived: “…characterised by cooperative R&D
and systematic links between independent research
agents; technological alliances between corporate users
and producers became widespread’ (Niosi, 1999). This
well describes the strategies of well-managed, userdriven Cooperative Research Centres in Australia (see
website ⬍www.crc.gov.au⬎).
Public research spin-offs may operate quite successfully and survive in any one of these disparate modes.
However, the literature suggests that spin-offs operating
in these second and third generation modes may survive,
but are unlikely to show significant growth
(Stankiewicz, 1994).
To have the potential for high growth, to become the
new mini-multinationals, small ventures need to develop
strategies to compete on a level playing field with existing mature larger enterprises. This requires discontinuous innovation, that generates disruptive technology, not
just continuous improvement—“not just managing discontinuities in the market place, but creating new discontinuities” (Miller and Morris, op. cit., p. 10;
Hamel, 2000.
Discontinuous innovation is driven by questions about
the ‘future’ needs of customers; these needs are rarely
articulated (Miller and Morris, op. cit., p. 10). Discontinuous innovation will most likely result from 1st generation research, the unbounded search for scientific breakthroughs. It will involve “… breakthrough inventions …
that are based on fundamental scientific research that
leads to new markets …and are almost impossible to
predict” (Miller and Morris, op. cit.). They can frequently result from the fusion of separate disciplines to
create new ones, e.g. biotechnology, nanotechnology,
mechatronics. “Discontinuous innovation is unbounded
because it is driven by the discovery of unmet, tacit
needs” (Miller and Morris, op. cit., p. 21).

The need is for a new business model and process
focussed on innovation as a whole, not just on its constituent
parts—R&D,
technology
development,
product/service development (Miller and Morris, op. cit.,
p. 22). Particularly, it must integrate tacit and explicit or
codified knowledge from all sources. The role of and
need for the entrepreneur may be quite different for the
different innovation domains. Such domains will be critically different where breakthrough inventions are
involved.
4.2. Commercialisation channels and options
The Scottish Enterprise strategy study quoted by
Cripps et al. (1999) identified a number of channels by
which innovation from the commercialisation of university and other public research can take place: viz. publication, education/training, collaborative research, contract research, industrial consultancy, licensing, spin-off
companies and joint ventures. The sources and potential
outcomes from these various commercialisation channels
for public sector research are illustrated in Fig. 3. This
paper is concerned with spin-off companies as NTBFs
rather than with the licensing of intellectual property to
established companies. In this context, the critical
decision is not about choice of commercialisation channel but about whether there is the potential to spin-off a
new start-up NTBF with high growth potential, however
defined (Yencken, 2001).
4.3. Entrepreneurial capacity as a knowledge resource
F.A. Hayek (1945) was an early proponent of the
importance of knowledge and its distribution in a well
functioning economy…Hayek’s pioneering work provides a starting-point for analysing how the distri-

<-----Page 4----->K. Hindle, J. Yencken / Technovation 24 (2004) 793–803

bution of knowledge affects organisational structure… (Jensen and Meckling, 1992, p. 252).
Penrose (1995–1999) first drew attention to the issue of
heterogeneity of resource mixes as a key consideration
in strategic analysis and management. For established
businesses, her concepts have since been further
developed and refined (Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt and
Martin, 2000; Peteraf, 1993; Rugman and Verbeke,
2002; Teece et al., 1997). More recently, Alvarez and
Busenitz (2001) have expanded resource-based theory to
include
entrepreneurship.
They
showed
how
entrepreneurship related resources could be identified in
their own right (Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001, p. 770).
They identified three specific knowledge resources that
the entrepreneur brings to a new venture and are critical
to “the creation of heterogeneous output through the firm
that are superior to the market”: the founder’s unique
awareness of opportunities, ability to acquire the
resources needed to exploit the opportunity, organisational ability to recombine homogeneous inputs into
heterogeneous outputs. Our analysis suggests that, for
start-ups involved in the process of technological innovation, these usually do not come from the one individual.
For such ventures the knowledge resource and skills
of the technology champion in managing technology
development are also important. Thorburn (2000) has
also shown the importance of transferring the tacit
knowledge of the inventors across into such new ventures. Legge and Hindle (1997) have equally demonstrated the importance of the tacit knowledge of the
entrepreneur in “managing rapid growth in a volatile
environment”.
It is the firm’s unique bundle of resources that is different from competitor firms that are potentially valu-

able and contribute to a firm’s competitive advantage
(Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001, p. 756).

5. The taxonomy of new venture spin-offs
Achs and Andretsch (1990) have thoroughly reviewed
the role of small firms and their contribution to commercially valuable innovation. The literature (Stanworth and
Curran, 1986; Smith, 1967) has identified many motivations or triggers other than wealth creation for establishing new small companies. These have included artisans wanting to own their own businesses; being
retrenched; being unhappy with a current working
environment and seeking a comfortable and satisfying
way of life. In the specific case of public research organisations, the motivation for creating spin-off companies
can also embrace the desire to market specialist skills
and tacit knowledge held within the host organisation
through consultancies and research contracts. These latter types of new ventures are described later as Technology Transfer Companies. The literature has also
shown the importance of the host organisation in the creation of public research spin-offs (e.g. Dahlstrand,
2001).
Recent studies of public research spin-off ventures in
Australia (Thorburn, 2000; Upstill and Symington,
1999) have suggested three main classes of new ventures
derived from public research agencies, classified primarily by the relationships back to the host or parent
organisation. These classes have been further expanded
in this paper to four classes:
(1) Direct research spin-offs (DRSO) are companies
which have been created in order to commercialise
IP arising out of a research institution where IP is
licensed, involving a patent or copyright, from the

<-----Page 5----->798

K. Hindle, J. Yencken / Technovation 24 (2004) 793–803

research institution to the new firm to form the
founding IP of the firm and staff may be seconded
or transferred full or part-time from the research
institution to the new firm.
(2) Technology transfer companies (TTC) are companies set up to exploit commercially the university’s
tacit knowledge and know how, usually but not
solely in the area of process rather than product
innovation, where no formally protected (e.g.
patents) IP and/or exclusive licensing is involved.
(3) Start-ups or indirect spin-off companies (ISO) are
companies set up by former or present university
staff and/or former students drawing on their experience acquired during their time at the university, but
which have no formal IP licensing or similar
relationships to the university.
Little or no Australian data are available on this last
group of companies. Studies elsewhere (Chalmers, 1992;
McQueen and Wallmark, 1984; Wallmark, 1997; van der
Meer and van Tilburg, 1999; Edinburgh Research and
Innovation, 2001, p. 3) have shown that indirect spinoffs occurred more than twice as frequently as direct
spin-offs, particularly when regional development has
been the driver for new business creation.
Finally there is a further class that may be called
‘spin-ins’:
(4) Spin-ins (to existing companies) can be defined as
new ventures deriving from the licensing or other
agreed exploitation of new knowledge generated by
public research agencies, whether or not separate
incorporated entities are set up or they may operate
as discrete ventures within the existing company.
There is a related but equally important class of spinouts from existing companies that lies in the domain of
corporate entrepreneurship (Bhidé, 2000) and which is
outside the scope of this paper. Fig. 4 illustrates the taxonomy and differing access to initial resources of the
different classes of new venture spin-offs and startups.
Skeptics like Feller (1990) have suggested that the
role of universities in technological development should
be essentially indirect. Stankiewicz (1994) however has
challenged the conceptual foundations on which this
assessment of spin-off performance has been based. He
has suggested a taxonomy of such NTBFs with differing
wealth creation characteristics, based on their main
modes of activity:
Consultancy and R&D contracting (CC) that exploit
competence shortages and R&D environments; they are
the technology transfer companies in the earlier Upstill
and Thorburn taxonomy. These are essentially based on
1st and 2nd generation R&D activities.
Product oriented mode (PO), organised around a well-

developed product (or process) concept and focussed on
the advanced development, production and marketing of
that product (or process). These are typical 3rd or 4th
generation R&D based companies and are traditionally
Schumpeterian in concept.
Technology asset oriented mode (TA), concerned with
the development of technologies which are subsequently
commercialised through spinning-out new firms, licensing, joint ventures or other types of alliance; these firms
are based on business models derived from new mixes
of fusion and discontinuous and potentially disruptive
innovation. The genesis of such new ventures typically
can come from 1st or other generation R&D modes.
Stankiewicz’s CC companies and the Upstill and Symington (1999) Technology Transfer (TTC) companies,
identified earlier, are common among academic spin-offs
(Stankiewicz op. cit., Oloffson and Wahlbin, 1984).
Their activities are an extension of the research activities
that are core competencies of academic researchers.
Capital requirements and risk are low. There appears to
be little need for entrepreneurial skills unless such companies grow to such a size that they separate off completely from their parent organisation. They do not
necessarily involve product or process innovations and
they are unlikely in Schumpeterian terms to change the
production function in their product/market sector
(Schumpeter, 1939, pp. 87 and 94).
Product oriented (PO) mode spin-offs match more
closely the classical entrepreneurial model. They are
organised around a well-developed product (or process)
concept and focus (Stankiewicz op. cit.). They will need
almost ab initio access to technology and product development skills, business network access and experience
and familiarity with their chosen product/market sector.
Research discussed in the next section shows these skills
as critical for new PO mode ventures survival and
growth.
Technology Asset (TA) spin-offs require a business
concept focused on the creation, development and management of technological assets. To become technological assets, research results and even the specific technologies have to be sufficiently packaged to make them
saleable (Stankiewicz op. cit.). Resource needs include
a whole new range of competencies ranging from intellectual property and knowledge protection to the identification and even creation of a market. The strategic
objective will be to develop the technology to the point
where its market value is optimal. These needs extend
beyond the traditional skills and experience even of the
serial entrepreneur, particularly in relation to IP and
technology management, and require an exceptional
level of commitment at all levels in the new venture.
Start-ups involved in pharmacology and new drug development can usually be classified as TA companies. Commonly they will licence their new products to major

pharmaceutical companies after successful Phase 1 clinical trials.
The focus in this paper is on Direct Research and to a
lesser extent Indirect Research Spin-offs, including both
Product Oriented and Technology Asset companies. A
recent survey of spin-offs from Australian universities
(Yencken and Gillin, 2002b) with 32 universities
responding, showed 175 Direct Research Spin-offs, 86
(49%) in the period from 1998 to 2000, and 43 Technology Transfer companies, 14 (33%) in the period from
1998 to the present. Several spin-offs in the
biotechnology/pharmaceutical and a smaller number in
other technology sectors appeared to fall into Stankiewicz’s Technology Asset class. The recent study managed
by the Association of Technology Managers and published by the Australian Research Council (ARC, 2002)
identified 35 DRSO-type start-ups out of universities in
Australia in the year 2000.

6. Synthesis: an integrated model
Three inputs particularly facilitate technology absorptive capacity and determine the rate of generation, survival and growth of new ventures exploiting technological innovation: that is, the ability to find ideas
convertible into opportunities, access to resources
(human and financial), access to knowledge.
6.1. Ideas and opportunities—the discovery process
Discovery of entrepreneurial opportunity has become
an increasingly important area of entrepreneurship
research (Venkataraman, 1997). Johnson et al. (1999)
identified as critical stages in the university research
commercialisation process ‘commercialisation readiness

and scanning and reporting’. They have seen commercialisation readiness as being ready to exploit future IP
requirements.
The most important recent work on discovery processes (Shane, 2000) has suggested that in the identification of opportunities the most critical factor is the prior
knowledge and personal history of the incipient entrepreneur. Current case studies by one of the present authors
suggest that the key trait in the discovery process is the
ability to think laterally in applying prior knowledge in
the identification of an entrepreneurial opportunity. This
trait was not specifically identified in the earlier literature
as an entrepreneurial trait (Welsh and White, 1983).
Chell (1986) in her earlier review suggests the importance of “the products of each individual’s total
history…(including the interaction between personal
traits and immediate environments) that in turn regulate
how new experiences affect him or her”.
For the incipient entrepreneur, Shane’s prior knowledge can be seen as a trigger of equal importance as
individual environments or situations.
6.2. Knowledge and other resources
Cooper et al. (1994) tracked the new venture performance of 2994 entrepreneurs over a three-year period. The
dependent variables were survival and growth (as number of employees). The study identified that the significant resource factors affecting growth were experience
in a similar business, number of partners, initial capital
and industry sector. The factors affecting both growth
and survival were experience in a similar business and
initial capital. Bruderl and Preisendorfer (1992) also
reported human capital specific factors as strong predictors of future success, with a strongly significant effect
of industry specific experience on venture survival.

<-----Page 7----->800

K. Hindle, J. Yencken / Technovation 24 (2004) 793–803

However, later work by Dahlquist et al. (2000) confirmed the significance of initial capital and industry sector, but found that the significance of management knowhow and specific industry know-how appeared “less
robust to changing contexts and measurements”.
Klofsten et al. (1988), Klofsten (1998) and Davidsson
and Klofsten (2002a,b) identified eight cornerstones
relating to resources utilised by new ventures, as predictors of their ultimate survival and growth. This Business
Platform Model suggests that a young firm’s likelihood
to survive and take off is contingent upon how well
developed the firm is as regards the business idea, the
product, the market, the organisation, core group
expertise, core group drive/motivation, customer
relations and other relations (Davidsson and Klofsten,
2002a, p. 1).
6.3. Knowledge inputs
Knowledge inputs in the early stage of new ventures
include prior knowledge in the discovery stage, background and new intellectual property and both codified
and explicit knowledge and tacit or implicit knowledge:
Codified knowledge inputs include:
앫 the published knowledge base of the science or engineering involved in the ‘discovery’,
앫 new knowledge, contained in patents, copyrights,
registered designs, etc., and
앫 the codified content of postgraduate or undergraduate
training in entrepreneurship and/or technology management.
Tacit knowledge inputs are no less important and
include:
앫 the ability to find ideas that can be converted into
opportunities (Johnson et al., 1999; Fiet and Migliore,
2001); Shane’s prior knowledge (Shane, 2000),
앫 technology and scientific background brought to the
new ventures by the ongoing involvement of the original inventors (Thorburn, 2000),
앫 familiarity with the particular product/industry sector
(Cooper et al., 1994), and
앫 entrepreneurial experience, including startup management, risk management, established access to business
networks, finance raising (Legge and Hindle, 1997).
The literature has shown the importance of environmental or border scanning on firm performance (Yoo, 2001;
Audet and d’Ambroise, 1998; Barringer and Bluedorn,
1999). Knowledge is not a static resource. It requires
frequent checking and updating. Scanning is also an
important source of new ideas and opportunities.
The final group of success factors relates primarily to
personal traits, commitment and personal past history as

it interacts with the new venture’s environments (Chell,
1996; Dahlstrand, 2001).
6.4. The integrative model
The process most usually involved in the initial stage
of development of an NTBF to exploit new knowledge
and research outcomes is illustrated in Fig. 5 (developed
by the authors). Across the middle, the diagram shows
the sequence of stages with the researcher generating
new knowledge that leads to an idea that is converted
into an opportunity and a vision that leads through technology development or proof of concept up to the first
exit point, when typically a venture capitalist or other
investor might be interested. This relates closely to the
five-phase model and the associated analysis of the critical junctures between phases developed by Vohora et
al. (2002).
For simplicity the model has been represented as a
linear process, but it will normally be iterative and messy
as illustrated earlier in Fig. 2. The lower circles show
the various knowledge inputs, reinforced by border scanning. Border scanning includes both awareness of external economic and regulatory happenings and being a
source of new ideas and opportunities. The upper triangles show the importance of access to entrepreneurial
capacity at the various phases of business development,
including finding the idea that leads to an opportunity
and acquiring and managing the resources needed. They
also show resource inputs from public sector innovation
support programs, seen by Mustar (1997) as essential
to the development of university spin-offs, and resource
inputs from investors and other interests such as customers and suppliers.

7. Conclusion: entrepreneurship’s role in
technological innovation
New ventures based on research-derived new knowledge usually have a high growth objective, even if this
is not always achieved. Growth involves risk and usually
giving away equity to obtain the necessary financial
resources. Success requires commitment and does not
necessarily, in the early stages, provide a comfortable
life style to the inventors and technology developers.
Their markets are necessarily global if they originated
in a small domestic market such as Australia. These are
however the ventures that have the potential to become
new mini-multinationals (‘$50 million businesses’) and
improve national technology absorptive capacity. They
will contribute to economic development from equity
earnings, new high technology jobs and by keeping
prototype/technology development and early stage
manufacturing in the country where the new knowledge
was developed. For these new ventures, the identification

of the market opportunity, business concept and business
model is much more demanding because of greater
uncertainty about the optimal product/market positioning. In the extreme case there may be no existing
market for the innovative product, process or service that
results from the technological innovation, and the business model has to address what may be the potential
market and how to create it.
The discovery of a potential commercial opportunity
requires both prior knowledge and lateral thinking
ability. The developers of such ventures then require
access to differing inputs of entrepreneurial capacity
according to the phase of development. This may come,
either by further developing their own competencies and
experience or alternatively by bringing in an experienced
(or surrogate) entrepreneur/manager as a new partner
(Vohora et al., 2002). These competencies include corporate strategy development, technology management,
management of start up enterprises, product/market strategy development, risk assessment and finance and other
resource management. Equally essential are total commitment and the personal traits of doggedness in the face
of adversity and of being a doer rather than an
observer—key entrepreneurial skills. In summary, the
process of innovation has a number of phases, from the
initial research and discovery phase, through definition
of the opportunity to product development and other late
stage aspects of commercialising a finished product.
Each phase will need a different mix of tacit and codified
knowledge inputs. Entrepreneurship and the associated
tacit knowledge, identified by Drucker (2002) as the
engine of innovation, is the glue required to meld all the

elements to convert an opportunity into a commercial
success.
7.1. Ongoing research plan
The research plan to explore further the validity of
this model and the various knowledge inputs involves
over 20 case studies based on theoretical sampling of
public research spin-off ventures established in Australia
and overseas between 1998 and 2000. This will allow
comparative analysis between differing classes of public
research providers (universities, CRCs and CSIRO) and
differing economic activity sectors (biotechnology,
instrumentation,
ITC
hardware,
engineering,
mining/minerals). The case studies will include qualitative data collection by interview on decisions and
decision-makers during the early stages of the venture
and on the various types of knowledge inputs. They will
also include comparative and longitudinal quantitative
data collection based on the survey methodology of Davidsson and Klofsten (2002a, b) using their Business Platform and its eight Cornerstones as a means of predicting
survival and growth, both looking back two years and
repeating this quantitative data collection in two year’s
time—a total elapsed time of six years.
