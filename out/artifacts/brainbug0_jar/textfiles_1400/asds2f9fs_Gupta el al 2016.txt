<-----Page 1----->Abstract
Academic inquiry into entrepreneurial phenomena has had a rich history over several decades
and continues to evolve. This editorial draws attention to the classics: seminal articles that make
profound contributions to the development of an academic field in entrepreneurship studies. We
focus on the formative years of entrepreneurship research, specifically the 1970s and 1980s, to
identify classics using a key informant approach that surveys members of the journal editorial
board. Each nominated classic is introduced and discussed by an editorial board member, with
particular focus on research opportunities that may be pursued going forward. Analyzing classics
allows for the recognition of substantive advances in entrepreneurship research and provides an
opportunity to delve on the academic progress achieved in understanding entrepreneurial
phenomena.
Keywords: classics, foundation, entrepreneurship, historical perspective

<-----Page 2----->Classics in Entrepreneurship Research: Enduring Insights, Future Promises
Entrepreneurship is a young academic field (Low, 2001; Chiles, Bluedorn, & Gupta,
2007), with the first academic book on entrepreneurship appearing in the 1930s and the first
academic presentation in the 1950s (Jennings & Brush, 2013). Starting from humble beginnings,
entrepreneurship research gradually gained momentum as the field increasingly acquired more
legitimacy. Prominent business schools, including Harvard and Wharton, commenced
entrepreneurship courses, endowed chairs in entrepreneurship got funded, conferences and
journals dedicated to entrepreneurship came into operation and rapidly acquired traction, and the
Academy of Management transitioned entrepreneurship from a special interest group to division
status (Bygrave, 2007). As a result of these developments, entrepreneurship became a popular
field of serious academic inquiry, with a growing community of researchers across a broad
spectrum of scholarly disciplines.
Given the increasing popularity of the academic field of entrepreneurship, the editors of
New England Journal of Entrepreneurship thought it was time to identify articles that may be
considered classics within the discipline. We defined a classic as a foundational article that was
first published before 1980, addressed ideas that are still relevant to the field, and subsequently
spawned follow-up research that still resonates in the field. The editors were motivated in part by
Bygrave (2007: 23)’s admonition to the field to look back at the articles published in the early
days for the “profound” effect they had on subsequent research on entrepreneurial phenomena.
Another motivation stemmed from the realization that other social science fields, including
disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and economics, readily recognize and appreciate
original classics, which has played a critical role in advancement of the respective fields.

3 
 

<-----Page 3----->Entrepreneurship researchers, however, have not yet identified the classics in the field, an issue
which the editors at this journal sought to redress.
There are many ways to identify classics in a field of research. We decided to adopt a
simple and yet elegant procedure to come up with a list of articles that may be considered
classics in entrepreneurship research. More specifically, we asked each member of the journal
editorial team to nominate a research article they believed made a foundational contribution to
entrepreneurship research within their field of expertise. In other words, we tasked the editorial
team with the identification of classic articles in entrepreneurship studies based on their
knowledge of the field and the advice of their close colleagues and collaborators. We required
that the nominated articles be from the 1970s or 1980s. There were three major reasons for
focusing on this particular time period. First, the 1970s and 1980s was a time when early works
on entrepreneurship appeared, so that by the 1990s entrepreneurship had gained considerable
legitimacy within the academy (Landstrom, 2015). The prestigious Babson Entrepreneurship
Research Conference began during this period, and the Journal of Business Venturing and Small
Business Economics were also founded in this time (Bygrave, 2007). Second, focusing on this
time period eliminated the chance that editors may nominate their own work as classic. Finally,
the distance in time allowed to test the relevance of these works based on the endurance of their
ideas over time. Despite some initial concerns about the constraints imposed by this time period,
it was well embraced by the editorial team. The selection of the studies and the criteria by which
they were considered to be classics were entirely at the discretion of each of the editors, and the
expertise within their network of collaborators.
There are 7 individuals associated with the journal in an editorial capacity, so we had a
total of 7 articles nominated as classics. The nominations proved to be interesting and revealing.
4 
 

<-----Page 4----->Not one editor could claim to have had previously read all the 7 nominated articles, reflecting the
diversity of research interests in the journal editorial team, and the need for a work of this nature
to exist as a point of reference for future scholarship within the field of entrepreneurship. Table 1
presents a list of the nominated articles along with the number of citations it has received on
Google Scholar as well as the Web of Science. Google Scholar reflects the popular and global
impact of each work. The Web of Science reflects a more purist understanding of scholarship
work, framed by Western privilege that comes from the necessary munificence of institutional
resources required to maintain this access.
----------------------------Insert Table 1 about here
------------------------------We also asked each editorial member to provide a brief write-up of a scholarly reflection
about the article they nominated. Our guideline asked each editor to include in their respective
summary, the reasons why they considered their particular article a classic, as well as what could
be considered the future research expectations emanating from, and informed by their nominated
article. We also agreed, collectively, to keep our individual write-up short, yet with enough
details for help other scholars to become acquainted with the relevance of the article. In addition,
we agreed to discuss new ideas on what kind of novel research can sprout from the selected
classics. The write-up about each classic article constitutes the remainder of this article. We
discuss below the classics in a chronological order. It is worth reiterating that each article was
selected because it was considered foundational on its own merits in a distinct area of
entrepreneurship. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and implications of our
efforts to identify classics in entrepreneurship research.
A Brief Journey into the Nominated Classics
Ket De Vries (1977), Entrepreneur as a person at the crossroads
5 
 

<-----Page 5----->The role of individuals in the entrepreneurship process as well as the impact of the
budding business venture and environment on entrepreneurial activities have been extensively
studied in the field of entrepreneurship. Early entrepreneurship studies focused on developing a
psychological profile of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurs were perceived to be significantly
different from nonentrepreneurs in terms of their backgrounds and personality traits (Gartner,
1985). Later studies, acknowledging the importance of the context in which entrepreneurial
activities occur, focused on how entrepreneurs respond to their environments.
Researchers (e.g. Low & MacMillan, 1988) argue that entrepreneurship is a multifaceted
phenomenon and hence a synthesized view should be adopted. For example, Gartner (1985)
provided an integrated framework for describing new venture creation which included
entrepreneurial individuals, process, environment and organization. Shane and Venkataraman
(2000) in their theorization of opportunity-based entrepreneurship defined the study of
entrepreneurship as the scholarly examination of how, by whom, and with what effects
opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited”
(p.218). Such definition and theorization focus on how entrepreneurial individuals interact with
their environments on various entrepreneurial activities as they create new business ventures.
Indeed, a synthesized view was presented in Ket De Vries’s (1977) article, with the
entrepreneur being described as a person at the crossroads. In this article, the author examined
social, economic and psychodynamic forces that can influence entrepreneurship. At the
individual level, Ket De Vries (1977) proposed three functions an entrepreneur fulfills:
innovation, management –coordinating, and risk-taking. He also discussed personality traits
common among entrepreneurs including desire to take personal responsibility for decisions,
preference for moderate degree of risk and a high need for achievement. In addition, Ket De
6 
 

<-----Page 6----->Vries (1977) pointed out that entrepreneurs are not a homogenous group and therefore different
types of entrepreneurs such as craftsman-entrepreneurs and opportunistic-entrepreneurs exist.
This article was a forerunner in that it discussed the emergence of a new type of entrepreneurs –
internal entrepreneurs and the existence of “internal entrepreneurship” in large bureaucratic
organizations which involves creation of new product ventures and new technology divisions in
existing companies (p.43). The author identified social and economic factors that can give rise to
entrepreneurship: ones’ social status (e.g. ethnic minority or immigrants), family background
(e.g. having a father who is self-employee), change in institutional patters and environment (e.g.
industry) turbulence. Moreover, Ket De Vries (1977) emphasized family dynamics and one’s
childhood and upbringing in his theoretical analysis. Lastly, he highlighted the importance of
entrepreneurial organization not only as a tangible reality of personal success but also a business
entity that is of emotional significance to entrepreneurs.
Ket De Vries’s (1977) review was a pioneer at a time when research on entrepreneurship
was in its infancy. His integrated view of entrepreneurship with attention to the individual,
organization and environment was further extended in later studies such as Gartner (1985) and
Shane and Venkataran (2000). Ket De Vries (1977) was among the first to direct the attention to
internal entrepreneurship, an important research topic in later studies called corporate
entrepreneurship (e.g. Sharma and Chrisman, 1999). He also proposed a novel analysis of the
role of family dynamics and one’s childhood experience in the emergence of entrepreneurship
and demonstrated the entrepreneur’s family of origin (Dyer & Handler, 1994).
As we continue to explore the myths and the phenomenon of entrepreneurship, it would
be wise for us to bear in mind this classic writing and theorization by Ket De Vries (1977). The
interest in studying the interactions among individual, family, organization and environment is
7 
 

<-----Page 7----->evident in more recent research on, for example, the role of human capital in technological
entrepreneurship (e.g. Wright, Hmieleski, Siegel & Ensley, 2007), the research on venture
creation and entrepreneurial intent (e.g. Shook, Priem, & McGee, 2003) and the research on
work-conflict and psychological well-being of entrepreneurs (e.g. Parasuraman & Simmers,
2001). From this perspective, future research should carry Ket De Vries’s (1977) insights
forward in explicating the nexus of these important components of entrepreneurship.
Pennings (1982), The urban quality of life and entrepreneurship
According to a report from the World Health Organization, as of 2010 already more than
half of the global population lives in urban areas understood as geographical spaces of higher
population density and vast human features in comparison with the surrounding areas (Global
Health Observatory, 2010). The same report suggests that this percentage will surpass 70% by
2050 as the process of urbanization builds on itself. This estimates present urban spaces as
locations with above average contiguous concentrations of human populations often with access
to basic services. Yet this understanding of urban does not speak of the quality of life in that
space. Pennings (1982) can be considered as the first scholar to make the link between
entrepreneurial outcomes and the different types of urban environments, thus recognizing that
not all urban spaces have the same allure for entrepreneurship. In doing so, he opened the
conversation to later works such as Porter’s (1995) work on the competitive advantage of the
inner city, Markusen’s (1996; 2005) ideas of urban development and businesses, and on the
arguments of the creative class by Richard Florida (2002).
Penning’s work have served, directly or indirectly, to frame ideas such as the integration
and collaboration of business and communities (Birla, 2006; Blowfield, 2007; Dearlove, 2002;
Ellis, 2001; Karnani, 2008), cities as the organizational extension of business (e.g., Forman &
8 
 

<-----Page 8----->Goldfarb, 2008; Hillman & Keim, 2001), urban places as an organizationally manageable space
(e.g., Buschmann & Coletta, 2009), and the organization of the community as a single economic
unit to achieve socioeconomic sustainability (e.g., Peredo & Chrisman, 2006). This work on
urban entrepreneurship also set precedents on methodology that identify different types of local
munificence as sources of local entrepreneurship (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994; Specht, 1993). Linking
munificence and entrepreneurship, Penning opens a conversation on principles of venture
creation (e.g., Amezcua, Grimes, Bradley, & Wiklund, 2013; Gartner, 1985) as well as
entrepreneurial ecosystems (e.g., Aldrich, 1990; Marin-Aguilar & Vila-López, 2014).
Findings in this paper can become pivotal for future research in entrepreneurship as the
number of urban dwellers increases and environmental issues take forefront in communities.
Original findings suggest a negative relationship between entrepreneurship and environmental
issues where pristine environments may deter entrepreneurship under certain conditions.
Likewise findings at the industry level hint the need for further research on the impact of zoning,
lobbying, and advocacy at the industry level. Furthermore, their original analysis on urban spaces
looks at ventures as externalities to their environment thus environmental factors are only
considered as resources to the venture rather than elements encouraging the actions of the
entrepreneur. Complementing this resource based view perspective, new research may consider
resources and ventures not as externalities to the venture but as part of the venture itself or a
network (Osorio, Ozkazanc-Pan, & Donnelly, 2015). Likewise, future work can consider that
environmental elements are also part and parcel of the venture itself (Calas, Smircich, & Bourne,
2009). Finally, using this work and its original findings, new venues of research can be
developed to explore how societal trends impact entrepreneurial spaces as we move into a
society where pristine environments are now the ideal space for lifestyle entrepreneurs and
9 
 

<-----Page 9----->technology entrepreneurship may focus on preserving these spaces rather than avoiding them, as
originally done.
Miller (1983), The correlates for entrepreneurship in three types of firms
Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) has been an interesting topic for entrepreneurship
scholars in past decades because under the rubric of corporate entrepreneurship, EO explores
origination and implementation of firm strategic behavior. EO literature has been explored over
the past three decades and the conversation of EO now exceeds the broader topic of corporate
entrepreneurship.
Most scholars agree that three foundational and pioneering works on EO are Mintzberg
(1973), Khandwalla (1977) and Miller (1983) (see Basso, Fayolle, & Bouchard, 2009 for a
review). Mintzberg (1973) first proposed ‘entrepreneurial mode’ of firms’ strategic decisionmaking and discussed how top managers commit organizations to ‘bold courses of action’. Later,
Khandwalla (1977) reinforced the importance of the top managers in pursuing and constructing
strategic decisions.
Miller (1983) is a critical piece in the history of entrepreneurship because it introduced
the conceptualization of entrepreneurial firms, encompassing three EO dimensionsinnovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness, which allows researchers to measure the degree
of entrepreneurial behavior and examine the EO-performance relationship. The concept of EO
advanced the field in understanding what it means, in a practical or behavioral sense, for a firm
to be entrepreneurial (Miller, 2011). A behavioral model of entrepreneurship promotes
discussion on how behaviors rather than attributes constitute the entrepreneurial process (Covin
& Slevin, 1991). Miller (1983) suggested that firm-level entrepreneurship should exhibit all
three behaviors with some degree of simultaneity (Anderson & Covin, 2014). Since then, a
10 
 

<-----Page 10----->significant number of researchers have used this construct to measure the EO-performance
relationship.
Miller (1983) also acknowledged a different approach in understanding what makes a
firm entrepreneurial. Specifically, he examined how senior managers’ decision-making may
influence firm strategy and such an influence could be contingent upon the nature of the
organization and its environment. In particular, Miller emphasized that ‘what is most important
is not who is the critical actor, but the process of entrepreneurship itself and the organizational
factors which foster or impede it’ (Miller, 1983: 770; emphasis in original). Miller’s approach
linked senior manager’s predisposition towards entrepreneurial decision-making with firm
strategy and the dynamic environment.
Later on, Covin and Slevin (1989) and Lumpkin and Dess (1996) advanced our
understanding of EO; in particular , Lumpkin and Dess (1996) proposed multidimensional views
of EO with autonomy and competitive aggressiveness recognized as additional important
dimensions of the construct, therefore shedding more light on the original Miller (1983) work of
unidimensional or composite construct.
Miller (1983)’s work therefore advances the field with the notion that firms can “be
entrepreneurial” because they engage in innovative, proactive, and risk-taking strategic
behaviors. The unique linkage of individual characteristics (senior managers), firm strategy and
performance, and environmental dynamism makes Miller (1983) a ground-breaking piece.
Gartner (1985), A conceptual framework for describing new venture creation
In 1985, Bill Gartner published a paper in the Academy of Management Review that
attempted to offer a holistic framework for examining the new venture. In subsequent years, this

11 
 

<-----Page 11----->paper has helped progress research and understanding of entrepreneurship as a distinct domain of
inquiry.
Gartner’s paper began with the observation that most of the then prevailing research on
entrepreneurship was premised on two broad assumptions: (i) that entrepreneurs are different
from non-entrepreneurs, and (ii) that entrepreneurial firms are different from non-entrepreneurial
firms. Such a classification, he reasoned, is simplistic: in practice, the difference among
entrepreneurial firms tends to be far greater than either differences between entrepreneurs and
non-entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial versus non-entrepreneurial firms. As such, Gartner
proposed that it would be valuable to recognize the diversity among entrepreneurs and their
ventures by examining a wider set of parameters and then classifying entrepreneurial ventures
into groups or clusters based on these parameters. Adopting Miller’s (1981) idea of the new
venture as a gestalt, Gartner (1985) proposed a novel framework that would distinguish new
ventures along four dimensions: individual(s), process, environment, and organization.
Additionally, based on findings of previous research, he identified within each dimension a
series of specific characteristics that could be utilized to differentiate among clusters of new
ventures. He suggested that such an approach would allow new ventures to be viewed as “a
kaleidoscope… [enabling researchers] to identify specific variables that describe how each new
venture was created, in order that meaningful contrasts and comparisons among new ventures
can be made” (p. 701). In turn, he opined such an approach would help arrive at a more informed
understanding of underlying factors that explicate the diversity among entrepreneurial firms,
explain conflicting empirical results, as well as lead to development and adoption of robust
methodologies to conduct research in this arena and report study findings.

12 
 

<-----Page 12----->Insights laid out in Gartner (1985) turned out to be immensely valuable in providing a
roadmap for follow-up entrepreneurship research, thus helping the field emerge from the
shadows of sister disciplines such as management and strategy. Subsequent researchers took up
all four dimensions identified by Gartner (1985) and examined them to lay a strong foundation
for the field. For example, in their paper defining the promise of entrepreneurship as a field of
research, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) highlighted the importance of Gartner’s (1985) work,
especially the processual aspects that serve as important elements to distinguish among
entrepreneurial firms. Bruyat and Julien (2001) took the insight from Gartner’s (1985)
framework to specifically suggest the interaction between an enterprising individual (or the
entrepreneur) and the environment as a process that evolves and helps build what the authors
classified as “new value creation”, and with the individual and the new object being created
acting as dialogic elements of such a process. Similarly, Bhave (1994) utilized thoughts from
Gartner (1985) to focus on the entrepreneurial process per se. In his work, he developed a
comprehensive model of how such a process evolves over the nascent stages of the new venture,
going from opportunity identification through technology setup and organization creation to
market exchange and customer interaction.
With regard to the individual dimension of Gartner’s (1985) framework, follow-up
research has branched off into several streams, of which at least two are most significant:
psychological aspects of entrepreneurship (e.g. Hisrich, Langan-Fox & Grant, 2007; Rauch &
Frese, 2000; Shaver & Scott, 1991) and entrepreneurial intention and cognition (Bird, 1988;
Gregoire, Corbett & McMullen, 2010). Similarly, on the organizational dimension, there is an
expanding stream of research that has emerged with regard to identification of firm-level
characteristics that distinguish between entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial firms and among
13 
 

<-----Page 13----->entrepreneurial firms themselves. A large part of the research elaborating the impact of Gartner’s
(1985) organizational dimension has been classified under the burgeoning research on
entrepreneurial orientation as a construct of significance, which examines the impact of firmlevel behavioral characteristics such as risk-taking, proactiveness, innovativeness, autonomy and
competitive aggressiveness on firm performance, survival and growth (Covin & Slevin, 1989;
Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin & Frese, 2009). Lastly, there is some
research emerging, which has begun to consider the fourth dimension of Gartner’s (1985)
framework: the role and impact of the environment on entrepreneurship (Edelman & Yli-Renko,
2010; Zahra & Covin, 1995; Zahra & Garvis, 2000).
To summarize, it can be said that Gartner’s (1985) seminal paper on the one hand served
to identify the relative weaknesses of prior approaches to examining new venture research and on
the other hand helped lay out a robust framework to facilitate research on entrepreneurial firms
along four critical dimensions to explain variation and diversity among them. In subsequent
years, the framework was enthusiastically embraced by entrepreneurship scholars to guide their
own research, though with varying degrees of adoption. Considering research that followed
publication of Gartner’s (1985) paper, it may be said that the framework had the most significant
influence on subsequent research with regard to insights relating to the individual and
organizational dimensions. In comparison, the impact of insights offered through the process and
environment dimensions have been relatively less spectacular. In conclusion, therefore, it may be
said that the process and environment dimensions are areas of the Gartner framework that hold
the highest potential for further exploration through incorporation into a range of research
questions, designs, and methodologies in the future.
Bowen and Hisrich (1986), The female entrepreneur: A career development perspective
14 
 

<-----Page 14----->At the time of its publication three decades ago, Bowen and Hisrich’s (1986) article was
one of the first to address and examine the notion of women’s entrepreneurship and focus
attention exclusively on female entrepreneurs. Their work was seminal for bringing together,
through a career development perspective, what had previously been disjunctive studies and
approaches to the study of women entrepreneurs. Their work offered a comprehensive
framework for understanding the entrepreneurial behavior of women through a careful outline of
impacts and influences on women’s ability and choices in pursuing entrepreneurship. In doing
so, they offered the entrepreneurship field a first glance at why and how women become engaged
in entrepreneurship.
In more recent times, while the focus on women’s entrepreneurship has blossomed but
compared to the majority of entrepreneurship work this still represents a small fraction of the
field. To this end, a number of influential studies have emerged in recent decades including those
focusing on specific challenges women face in entrepreneurship ranging from psychological
barriers such as gender stereotypes to structural barriers such as access to capital (De Bruin et al.,
2007; Brush & Edelman, 2000; Carter et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2008; Sullivan & Meek, 2012;
Sweida & Reichard, 2013; Thebaud, 2010). In addition to these approaches, some work has
adopted a critical perspective to highlight and question gendered assumptions guiding
entrepreneurship research (Ahl, 2004, 2006; Ahl & Marlow, 2012; Bird & Brush, 2002; Bourne,
2010; Brush et. al., 2009; Calás et al., 2009; Clark Muntean & Ozkazanc-Pan, 2015;
Mirchandani, 1999; Robb & Watson, 2012). Thus, the field of women’s entrepreneurship is
becoming richer through the various different perspectives adopted by scholars ranging from
micro-level psychological dimensions, to meso-level organizational issues, and macro-level
structural and societal elements.
15 
 

<-----Page 15----->Future research in this area can extend these lines of inquiry. However, rather than doing
so in a piecemeal fashion, the emphasis should be on understanding the interdependencies across
these levels and how they might create challenges unique for women entrepreneurs across
differences of race, ethnicity, education, and so forth. Furthermore, future work can also examine
how different ecosystems foster women’s entrepreneurship through multi-level analyses of all
stakeholders including entrepreneurs, support organizations, and policy makers (see Watkins et
al., 2015). Doing so will allow for a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship and allow for
actionable policies to redress inequities facing women engaged in business.
Bird (1988), Implementing entrepreneurial ideas: The case for intentions
Since the 1980s, the subject of entrepreneurial intentions has been among the most
researched topics in the field of entrepreneurship, and has provided scholars with a powerful
theoretical framework (Linan & Fayolle, 2015). Shapero and Sokol (1982) and Shapero (1984)
initiated the discussion of entrepreneurial intentions by highlighting the influence of social,
political and economic variables on entrepreneurial intentions. Subsequently, Katz and Gartner
(1988) investigated the role of the entrepreneur’s intentions (as well as other stakeholders’
intentions) on new ventures and existing ventures. However, Bird’s (1988) seminal publication
was the first to examine the topic of entrepreneurial intentions through cognitive perspectives,
and offered a psychological model to explain how entrepreneurial intentions are formed. Bird’s
work is considered a classic for several reasons. For one, it is the first study on entrepreneurial
intentions that attempts to go beyond descriptive studies to offer a systematic approach to
differentiate entrepreneurship from strategic management (Bird, 1988). Second, it is among the
earliest studies to bring cognitive perspectives into the analysis of entrepreneurship. Cognitive
research is specifically important to entrepreneurship because it provides crucial insights into key
16 
 

<-----Page 16----->aspects of the entrepreneurial process (Baron, 2004). Finally, Bird makes a clear distinction
between entrepreneurial intentions and similar concepts, such as goal setting and the manager’s
intentions in established firms. By means of these distinctions, she helped establish
entrepreneurial intention as a separate field of research with its own theoretical framework.
In her model, Bird explains how entrepreneurial intentions are formed based on certain
factors, including the entrepreneurs’ needs, values, wants, habits and beliefs. These factors result
in the entrepreneur creating and maintaining a temporal tension, sustaining strategic focus, and
developing a strategic posture. Bird also explains how intentionality is a result of both rational
and intuitive thinking, which are influenced by contextual and personal factors. Since Bird’s
publication, an increasing number of studies have been published based on her model of
entrepreneurial intention. Some of these studies focus on improving Bird’s model by adding
other cognitive components and perspectives into the model (e.g. Boyd & Vozikis, 1994;
Krueger, 2007, 2009). Other research has been focused on the factors that influence
entrepreneurial intentions. Improvisation (Hmieleski & Corbett, 2006), entrepreneurial education
(Souitaris, Zerbinati, & Al-Laham, 2007; Pittaway & Cope, 2007; Wilson, Kickul, & Marlino ,
2007), risk perception (Segel, Borgia, & Schoenfeld 2005), prior family exposure to
entrepreneurship (Carr & Sequeira, 2007), and gender stereotypes (Gupta et al., 2008) are all
among the identified factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions.
Although the subject of entrepreneurial intentions has grown rapidly as a field of study,
there is still room for additional research. A very important component of Bird’s argument is the
impact of intentionality on entrepreneurial action in terms of both venture creation and venture
growth. Although several studies (e.g. Kolverid & Isaken, 2006; Kautonen, Van Gelderen, &
Tornikoski 2013) have examined the relationship between venture creation intention and the
17 
 

<-----Page 17----->actual creation of venture, very few studies (with the exception of Kloverid & Bullvag, 1996)
have examined the process through which an entrepreneur’s growth intentions influence the
growth of the venture. In addition, with the rise of social entrepreneurship research, scholars may
benefit from Bird’s model to gain a better understanding of both social entrepreneurship
intentions and sustainable entrepreneurship intentions, two areas that have yet to be researched in
greater depth (Linan & Fayoll, 2015).
Covin and Slevin (1989), Strategic management of small firms in hostile and benign
environment
A quick glance through the entrepreneurship articles published in top-tier peer reviewed
journals reveals a lively discussion developing around the topic of entrepreneurial orientation,
generally referred to as EO. Common definitions of EO conceive it as a firm-level construct
capturing the managerial tendencies and decision-making philosophies that are entrepreneurial in
nature (Covin & Lumpkin, 2011). Basso, Fayolle, and& Bouchard (2009: 313) observe that EO
“seems to be one of the few examples of stabilized concepts in management science.” While the
origins of EO scholarship can be rightly traced back to the works of Khandwalla (1976) and
Miller (1983), it is not commonly realized that research in this area truly began in earnest with
the publication of Covin and Slevin (1989). Given the proliferation of EO-related research in
entrepreneurship, management, and other disciplines such as marketing and tourism studies
(Gupta & Gupta, 2015), it seems justified to nominate Covin and Slevin (1989) as an original
classic in entrepreneurship studies. To give credit where it is due, our nomination follows Wales,
Gupta, and Mousa (2013) who used SSCI citations as a basis for considering Covin and Slevin
(1989) an entrepreneurship classic.

18 
 

<-----Page 18----->Several excellent reviews of EO scholarship have been published in recent years (Gupta
& Gupta, 2015; Wales, Gupta, & Mousa, 2013; Wales, 2016). A common theme across these
reviews, and others (e.g., George, 2011; Lumpkin & Dess, 2005), is that EO remains a fertile
topic of inquiry. The popular appeal of EO seems to stem from its ability to speak to one of the
most critical managerial questions: Why do some firms perform better than others? EO purports
to explain superior firm performance as stemming from a firm’s decision-making policies,
managerial practices, and behavioral activities that are entrepreneurial in nature. To capture EO,
Covin and Slevin (1989) emphasized the three dimensions of risk-taking, proactiveness, and
innovativeness, developing a nine-item scale to assess a firm’s strategic commitment to
entrepreneurship. Since then, the EO-performance link has emerged as the most studied
relationship in the EO literature (Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009), with new
contributions continuing to illuminate the performance consequences of EO from novel
perspectives. In addition to the main effect of EO on firm performance, scores of studies have
examined internal and external contingencies that may impinge on this relationship. Notably,
support for predictions about EO effects has been found outside the US as well, with Sweden and
China among prominent examples of countries where EO research has been done. So prolific has
been the research on EO over the years that the number of manuscripts now published on the
topic of EO exceed that of articles examining the broader topic of corporate entrepreneurship
(Wales, 2016).
Despite years of research, the EO literature continues to generate excitement about
several promising research questions worthy of future research. We mention three research
endeavors here that we believe engender directly from Covin and Slevin (1989). One crucial area
within EO research that has received little attention so far is the mechanisms through which EO
19 
 

<-----Page 19----->translates into firm performance- in other words, mediators linking EO with firm performance.
Another critical issue in the EO literature pertains to elaborating the theoretical foundations for
the EO-performance relation. Currently, the positive EO-performance relation is accepted either
on faith or on the basis of empirical evidence, but little conceptual rationale is offered to justify
it. Finally, there is an emerging debate within the literature as to whether the dimensions of EO
are additive in nature as has generally been assumed (Kuratko, 2007) or may actually be
multiplicative (Slevin & Terjesen, 2011) or even geometric (Gupta, 2015). These are all exciting
questions that scholars need to grapple with going forward, but they are only the proverbial tip of
the iceberg as the EO literature is replete with new and engaging possibilities for further research
(e.g. Wiklund & Shepherd, 2011).
Discussion
Entrepreneurship is a vibrant academic field with a rich history. With the goal of
recognizing some of the key articles that advanced research in the early years of inquiry on
entrepreneurial phenomena, we set out to identify and discuss classics that helped lay the
foundation for future scholarship in the field. Classics are considered the “gold bullion of
science” (Smith, 2007) and they help provide a historical perspective on the scientific
advancements in a field. Using a focused key informant approach, we identified seven classics in
entrepreneurship research, published over the two decades of the 1970s and 80s. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first systematic effort to reveal the classical articles in
entrepreneurship research and their impact on subsequent scholarship.
Our approach to the identification of classics is substantially influenced by two decisions
we made: (a) time period of 1970s and 1980s, and (b) asking journal editors for nomination. The
imposition of these two conditions substantially influenced our identification of classic articles.
20 
 

<-----Page 20----->For example, publications from this period represent the moment in time when we started to
reflect on our current views on entrepreneurship as the 1970s and 1980s were cultural and
societal tipping points. Thus extending the time period under investigation to include the 1990s
and 2000s, for example, may have introduced other articles to our list, but publications during
this period can hardly be considered classics as they may still be too young to assess their true
impact in the field, thus not addressed in the scope of this review Likewise, moving beyond the
subjective opinions of key informants like journal editors to more objective indicators (such as
citations) or tapping into the ‘wisdom of the crowds’ by polling members of the entrepreneurship
division may also have introduced other articles to our list. Future investigations may benefit
from pursuing alternative paths not taken in the study reported here.
The classics nominated here may be influenced by the academic training and affiliations
of the editors at North American doctoral programs. It is possible that scholars from other parts
of the world may have selected different articles as classics in entrepreneurship research. Our
concerns about ethnocentrism in the nominating process are somewhat alleviated by the
realization that entrepreneurship research has been, and continues to be, dominated by North
American scholarship. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to probe into the views held by
researchers from different parts of the world with regard to the classic articles in
entrepreneurship studies.
We hope this pioneering effort to identify classics in entrepreneurship research, as well as
the recent publication of other articles with similar historical flavor (Carlsson et al., 2013;
Landstrom, Harichi, & Astrom, 2012), will spur discussions about the formative years of the
field of entrepreneurship studies and its future. As entrepreneurship research becomes broader
and more fragmented, we believe it is worthwhile to pause and reflect on the enduring value of
21 
 

<-----Page 21----->key articles that opened new vistas for entrepreneurship scholars to explore. Perusal of original
articles from the early days of entrepreneurship research educate and inspire further research
from established incumbents as well as new entrants to the field.
