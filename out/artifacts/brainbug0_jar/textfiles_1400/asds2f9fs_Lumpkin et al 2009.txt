Understanding and
Measuring Autonomy:
An Entrepreneurial
Orientation Perspective
G.T. Lumpkin

Dawn R. Schneider

Autonomy is an important component of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO), but most
studies that assess the EO construct do not include autonomy measures. This article first
addresses the theoretical relevance of autonomy as an element of firm-level entrepreneurial
behavior. After a review of existing autonomy measures, it then proposes scale items to test
the autonomy dimension of EO. Finally, it reports the results of two studies of the proposed
autonomy scale and addresses implications for future EO-related autonomy research.

Introduction
The independent spirit and freedom of action necessary to advance new venture
development is a driving force of entrepreneurial value creation (Burgelman, 2001). For
entrepreneurship to thrive in many organizational contexts, “the exercise of autonomy by
strong leaders, unfettered teams, or creative individuals who are disengaged from organizational constraints” is required (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 140). Autonomy affords
organizational members the freedom and flexibility to develop and enact entrepreneurial
initiatives.
In the context of strategic entrepreneurship, autonomy enables both opportunityseeking and advantage-seeking behaviors (Ireland, Hitt, & Sirmon, 2003). Strategic entrepreneurship refers in part to creating competitive advantages by using entrepreneurial
initiatives to pursue opportunities (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990), and transforming existing
organizations by redeploying resources (Zahra, 1993) and renewing strategic capabilities
(Guth & Ginsberg, 1990). The effective use of autonomy, in organizational structures and
by entrepreneurial champions, is needed to achieve such results. In organizations with
strong entrepreneurial cultures, practices aimed at fostering autonomy, such as W.L. Gore’s
belief in “the power of small teams” (Deutschman, 2004), are designed to create environments where autonomous behavior stimulates entrepreneurial outcomes.Autonomy may be
even more important in settings where strategic renewal occurs only because key individuals champion entrepreneurial initiatives that transform an organization’s strategic posture

dimension of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO).
Although the role and importance of some types of autonomy have been studied
in prior management research (e.g., Hackman & Oldham, 1975; Hart, 1991), few studies
have investigated how autonomy contributes to the entrepreneurial value creation process.
A primary reason for this shortcoming, we believe, is the absence of an effective means
to measure autonomy in an EO context. Therefore, the purpose of this article is twofold:
(1) to investigate autonomy from an EO perspective, exploring the role that autonomy
plays in entrepreneurial value creation; and (2) to provide clarity, both theoretically and
empirically, regarding the measurement of firm-level autonomy.
In the next two sections, we address the type of autonomy that is found in organizations with a strong EO. This discussion will serve to distinguish entrepreneurial autonomy
from other types of autonomy found in the management literature. We then propose an
autonomy scale aimed at complementing and extending existing EO measures (Covin &
Slevin, 1986, 1989). Next, we report the findings of two studies conducted to demonstrate
the content validity and discriminant validity of the proposed autonomy scale and discuss
content adequacy issues surrounding the dimensions of EO. Finally, we address the
measurement properties of our proposed autonomy scale and implications of our scaledevelopment efforts for future EO research.

The Role of Autonomy in an Entrepreneruial Orientation Context
The first purpose of this article is to examine the role of autonomy from an EO
perspective. EO has emerged as a major concept within both strategic management and
entrepreneurship literatures. Many successful firms attribute their success to an EO
(McGrath & MacMillan, 2000), an approach to decision making that draws on entrepreneurial skills and capabilities. An EO keeps firms alert by exposing them to new technologies, making them aware of marketplace trends, and helping them evaluate new
possibilities. By keeping decision makers focused on industry changes and customer
demand, an EO helps companies identify opportunities and launch new ventures. As a
result, firms that exhibit a strong EO generally have higher performance (e.g., Rauch,
Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, in press).
Although Lumpkin and Dess proposed the inclusion of autonomy as a dimension of
EO in 1996, few EO studies have investigated autonomy as an element of EO. This lack
of inclusion, we believe, has occurred for two reasons. First, autonomy is not one of the
“original” dimensions of EO identified by Miller (1983) and developed by Covin and
Slevin (1986, 1989)—innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking. Further, some
researchers have suggested that autonomy is an antecedent of entrepreneurial behavior
rather than one of its essential components. In the remainder of this section, we provide
a more in-depth argument in support of the central role of autonomy in a firm’s EO.
Second, the adoption of the autonomy dimension has been impeded by the lack of a valid
firm-level scale that measures autonomy from an EO perspective. Although several
autonomy scales have been used in prior management research, few are appropriate for
assessing EO-related autonomy. Following this section, therefore, we address approaches
to measuring autonomy that are relevant in an EO context.
Organizations that rely on an EO to create new value and grow must make an extra
effort to foster entrepreneurial behavior (Burgelman & Sayles, 1986; Kanter, 1983). This
often involves freeing organizational members—both individuals and teams—to operate
48

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->outside an organization’s existing norms and strategies where they can think and act more
independently. In the context of EO, therefore, autonomy is essential to the processes of
leveraging a firm’s existing strengths, identifying opportunities that are beyond the organization’s current capabilities, and encouraging the development of new ventures and/or
improved business practices (Kanter, North, Bernstein, & Williams, 1990). As such,
numerous scholars have argued that autonomy is required for entrepreneurial initiatives to
emerge and thrive, and constitutes a basic feature of entrepreneurially oriented organizations (e.g., Antoncic & Hisrich, 2003; Burgelman & Sayles; Kanter).
Independent entrepreneurial action provides the impetus needed to explore business
opportunities, bring forth business concepts, and carry them through to completion (Bird,
1988; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Decision making by individuals or teams who are
unhindered by strategic norms or organizational traditions that may impede them is
necessary to effectively investigate entrepreneurial possibilities and champion new
venture concepts (Burgelman, 1983; Green, Brush, & Hart, 1999). Prior research supports
the view that, within organizations, autonomy encourages innovation, promotes the
launching of entrepreneurial ventures, and increases the competitiveness and effectiveness
of firms (Brock, 2003; Burgelman, 2001). By contrast, firms that are overly dependent on
participativeness in decision making and require consensus to be reached before launching entrepreneurial initiatives may suffer financially (Covin, Green, & Slevin, 2006).
In an organizational context, both “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches may be
useful for encouraging autonomy (Quinn & Spreitzer, 1997). Companies with an overall
entrepreneurial mission use a top-down approach to stimulate entrepreneurial activity
(Birkinshaw, 1997). For example, in organizations such as 3M and the Virgin Group, top
managers support programs and incentives that foster a climate of entrepreneurship and
welcome autonomous decision making. These companies are well-known for supporting
the type of independent thinking and action that is characteristic of autonomy. W.L. Gore,
for example, encourages employees to spend up to ten percent of their time exploring
speculative new ideas, allows for the championing of new venture concepts by any
organizational member, and supports small teams because it believes they promote
autonomy (Deutschman, 2004). For companies such as Gore, autonomy is a defining
feature of their organizational design. Prior analysis suggests that such organizational
design features may be as important to entrepreneurial success as the other dimensions of
EO because firms are able to “become more entrepreneurial through processes and
structures as well as by introducing new products and/or entering new markets” (Dess
et al., 2003, p. 355).
Many of the best ideas for entrepreneurial ventures, however, come from the bottom
up. To encourage autonomous decision making at the grass roots of such organizations,
special incentives and structural arrangements designed to develop and build support
for entrepreneurial ventures may be required (Helgesen, 1996). In some organizations,
however, even the best ideas are not welcome by top management (Dougherty & Hardy,
1996). Whether entrepreneurial initiatives are supported or stifled, it is often the autonomous efforts of key individuals acting outside the chain of command which generate
entrepreneurial outcomes (Burgelman, 1983). Such individuals, often referred to as champions, provide the impetus needed to pursue opportunities or implement an entrepreneurial vision (Bird, 1988; Green et al., 1999). Autonomous individuals, operating outside
their usual work routines and practices to stimulate entrepreneurial development and
growth, represent an important source of creativity and initiative in many organizational
settings (Burgelman & Sayles, 1986).
This top-down, bottom-up contrast is roughly parallel to a distinction found in prior
autonomy research. Autonomy is often viewed as having a hierarchical-type construction,
January, 2009

49

<-----Page 3----->that is, different levels or degrees of autonomy depending on the types of actions or
decisions a group can control (Gulowsen, 1972). The extent to which a group has control
or can make decisions about factors within the work environment can be referred to
as structural autonomy (Gulowsen). Also referred to as “autonomy of means” (Bouchard,
2002), structural autonomy enables a team to solve a problem with self-determined means
(within given resource constraints). By contrast, strategic autonomy or “autonomy of
goals” (Bouchard), refers to the extent to which a group has control over ends, i.e., its
goals. Strategic autonomy enables a team to operate outside normal organizational constraints in addressing what it will accomplish and how it will achieve its objectives.
Viewing autonomy on a hierarchical scale, strategic autonomy would possess a superior
(or higher) position relative to structural autonomy.
Autonomy from an EO perspective refers primarily to strategic autonomy. These
higher levels or strategic dimensions of autonomy enable a team (or individual) to not
only solve problems, but to actually define the problem and the goals that will be met in
order to solve that problem. Levels of strategic autonomy can be likened to Hart’s (1992)
generative mode of strategy making, or Gulowsen’s (1972) qualitative goal autonomy.
Hart’s generative mode depends on organizational members behaving in an autonomous
fashion as they pursue innovation (Hart). The role of top management in this mode is to
encourage innovation by facilitating experimentation and risk taking through organizational systems and informal processes at both individual and team levels. The level of
autonomy a team possesses has been positively related to effective knowledge management, such that higher levels of autonomy facilitate knowledge creation, transfer, and
application (Janz & Prasarnphanich, 2005; Smith, 2001). As autonomy becomes increasingly strategic, there will be an increase in the type of sharing and facilitating of knowledge that fosters entrepreneurial outcomes. Thus, for a firm to achieve a high level of
EO, autonomy should exist at the strategic level. By contrast, although structural
autonomy is necessary to obtain firm-level autonomy, we posit that it may not be sufficient to enhance entrepreneurial performance. In the next section, we evaluate the
major autonomy scales that have been used in prior research to identify the types of
structural and strategic elements that need to be included in an EO-based autonomy
scale.

Measuring Autonomy
Organizational autonomy is an established concept within the management literature
and has been described using a variety of frameworks. Autonomy can be possessed by
either individuals or groups and can exist for either lower-level employees or among more
senior decision makers (Langfred, 2000). Gulowsen (1972) viewed autonomy as a singledimensional construct; more recent research suggests that autonomy is a multidimensional construct, and that the type of autonomy may be as important as the amount (e.g.,
Janz, Colquitt, & Noe, 1997). Sandberg (1982) argues that individuals and work groups
cannot be classified simply as autonomous or not autonomous; instead, types and levels of
autonomy fall along key continua. Thus, prior autonomy research has addressed several
different types of management-related autonomy.

Existing Autonomy Scales
As part of our study, we undertook a comprehensive review of the autonomy literature
to find extant scales used to measure autonomy. A summary of these scales is presented in

Table 1 and discussed in the following subsections. (Scales listed in Table 1 are available
on request.)
Work Group Autonomy Scale (WGA). The 10-item work-group autonomy scale created
by Gulowsen (1972) was the first of its kind and is still used as a basis for modified scales
today (e.g., Woywode, 2002; Wright & Barker, 2000). Gulowsen proposed that autonomy
is a one-dimensional property that can be measured in terms of degrees, i.e., hierarchically. In order to reach a certain level or degree of autonomy, according to Gulowsen, a
group must satisfy all criteria that precede it on the scale of autonomy. Thus, groups with
a higher level of autonomy will exhibit more WGA-scale elements than groups with lower
levels of autonomy. Groups cannot make higher-level decisions (such as influencing
qualitative and quantitative goals) unless lower-level decisions are also made. Further, if
one level of autonomy low on the scale is dependent on certain external conditions, all
levels of autonomy higher on the scale are equally dependent on those conditions
(Gulowsen). The WGA begins with the ability of group members to determine their own
production methods and moves to increasingly strategic issues such as the group’s ability
to influence qualitative goals and/or decide on issues of leadership.
Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS). Hackman and Oldham (1975) proposed that five job
characteristics—skill variety, task identity, task significance, feedback, and autonomy—
ultimately create positive personal and work outcomes (e.g., work motivation, satisfaction, performance). Each job characteristic dimension is measured with three items
(including three autonomy items, which assess decision latitude, personal initiative, and
opportunity for independence). The core job dimensions are combined into a single
“motivating potential score” (Hackman & Oldham), which indicates the degree to which
January, 2009

<-----Page 5----->the respondent’s objective job characteristics will prompt internal work motivation. The
JDS is still commonly used to measure the relationship between job characteristics,
internal motivation, and work outcomes (e.g., Abbott, Boyd, & Grant, 2006).
Work Method Autonomy Scale (WMA). The 9-item WMA scale was initially reported by
Breaugh in 1985 and further refined in 1999 (Breaugh, 1999). The scale contains items
which assess three structural dimensions of autonomy: work method, work scheduling,
and work criteria. As defined by Breaugh (1999), work method autonomy entails how
much discretion or choice individuals have about the methods and procedures they use in
completing their work. Work scheduling autonomy assesses how much control the workers
feel they have over scheduling, sequencing, and timing of their activities at work. Finally,
work criteria autonomy addresses how much workers can modify or choose the criteria
that are used for evaluating their performance. While the actual WMA scale is not
frequently used in other studies, the concepts of work method, work scheduling, and work
criteria autonomy are often cited as key elements of autonomy (e.g., Denton & Kleiman,
2001; Stavroulakis, 1997).
Group Participation Index (GPI). Little (1988) developed the GPI using suggestions
from Gulowsen (1972). The purpose of the 26-item GPI is to measure both autonomy and
global job satisfaction, as both are dominant interests in organizational studies. Nineteen
items within the scale analyze both individual and group-level autonomy. Although the
GPI scale may be used to compare autonomy with satisfaction, that is not its primary
objective. It has a variety of purposes including comparing existing work groups in terms
of levels of autonomy, examining effects of organizational or technological change, and/or
monitoring the effects of change over time (Little).
Strategy-Making Modes (SMM). Hart’s (1991) 25-item strategy-making process scale
includes four strategy-making modes: rational, transactive, symbolic, and generative.
These modes differ along two dimensions: management intentionality and autonomy of
organizational actors. In the rational mode, strategy is deliberate and organizational actors
lack autonomy. When autonomy is still lacking, but strategy is emergent, the transactive
mode is represented. In the symbolic mode, strategy is deliberate but actor behavior is
autonomous. Finally, the generative mode is represented by emergent strategy and
autonomous actor behavior. Seven of the 25 SMM items are designed specifically to
capture organizational actor autonomy.
Innovation-Championing Strategies (ICS). Shane, Venkataraman, and MacMillan
(1995) investigated the relationship between cultural variables and innovation championing behaviors. Their multidimensional scale includes an 8-item measure of group-level
autonomy (in addition to measures of cross-functional appeal and locus of support). The
autonomy items sample content such as making decisions outside the traditional hierarchy, bypassing standard operating procedures, and not having to justify every financial
decision made.
Decision-Making Procedures (DMP). Taggart’s (1996) decision-making autonomy
scale assesses the decision-making authority held by subsidiaries of corporate parents.
Four levels of authority are created from two dimensions (decision locus and input locus):
parent company decision without subsidiary input, parent company decision with subsidiary input, subsidiary decision with parent company input, and subsidiary decision
without parent company input.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Collective Role Breadth (CRB) and Collective Task Control (CTC). Sprigg, Jackson,
and Parker (2000) created a 10-item scale by modifying two different existing scales
(Jackson, Wall, Martin, & Davids, 1993; Little, 1988). The emphasis of the scale is on
collective action and items are designed to assess team-level concerns such as the role of
the team in deciding work targets, work pace, and the authority of the team to discipline
other team members. Although the entire scale is not published in their work, the authors
readily provided it for our study.

Concerns Regarding Current Autonomy Scales
As our preceding review suggests, there are several established methods for measuring group-level autonomy. For the purposes of measuring autonomy in an EO context,
however, the major scales we surveyed have a number of shortcomings that suggest the
need to develop an improved measure. In general, current scales lack generalizability
across contexts, are sometimes indistinct from measures of (de)centralization, and are
often limited to measurement of structural autonomy without regard to strategic
autonomy. Each of these concerns will be discussed later.
First, current measures often focus on a particular industry or job in an organization,
thus limiting their use across contexts. Because our intent was to identify a scale that could
be used in different types of organizations, context-specific scales were considered unsatisfactory. For example, the WGA (Gulowsen, 1972) was designed primarily to measure
the autonomy of low-technology traditional industries and lacks compatibility with
modern high-technology industries (Bailey & Adiga, 1997). Further, Bailey and Adiga
found that the hierarchical ordering of the WGA components does not fit within certain
organizations. In comparing their proposed scale to that of the WGA, they found that those
high or low in autonomy were identified in both scales. The limitations of the WGA scale
specifically lie in those firms with a moderate level of autonomy.
Second, many of the current approaches to measuring autonomy lack distinction
between autonomy and decentralization. Although autonomy and decentralization may be
similar, Brock (2003) argues that they differ and imply unique organizational outcomes.
Autonomy refers to how much decision-making authority a person, position, or organization holds, whereas centralization refers to how concentrated decision making is in an
organization (whether situated in a single point or distributed throughout the organization
(Brock). For example, while the Taggart (1996) scale is designed to measure decisionmaking autonomy, it actually measures which entity makes decisions versus what types of
decisions are made. The most commonly used scales often include measures of both
centralization and autonomy. Researchers need to choose their operationalization based
on the theoretical grounding of their study, as (de)centralization and autonomy are often
not acceptable surrogates for each other.
Finally, a majority of existing scales focus only on structural-level autonomy. With a
few exceptions (e.g., Hart, 1991; Shane et al., 1995), most scales focus exclusively on the
structural level while a few used a mix of strategic and structural approaches to autonomy
(e.g., Gulowsen, 1972; Sprigg et al., 2000). As noted earlier, the type of autonomy
suggested by an EO is primarily strategic, that is, concerned with having the freedom and
independence to make decisions about entrepreneurial initiatives rather than simply
addressing structural issues such as work hours, work procedures, or when to complete a
task.
Based on our review, we felt that none of the extant scales adequately assessed
autonomy from an EO perspective. Specifically, EO guides decision making and thus a
measure of autonomy as a dimension of EO should be viewed in a similar manner.
January, 2009

53

<-----Page 7----->Autonomy is not simply a way to design or structure a team, but rather a strategic
orientation reflective of an entrepreneurial climate. In viewing autonomy this way, we
believe existing scales fall short in their approach to capturing the construct. In the next
two sections, therefore, we draw on insight from existing scales to propose an EO-based
autonomy scale and report results from empirical tests of the proposed scale.

Methods
A key goal of this paper is to investigate and propose appropriate ways to measure
autonomy and to demonstrate that it is distinct from the other dimensions of EO. As an
aspect of the measurement issue, we are also interested in content validity, that is, the
degree to which our approach to measuring autonomy reflects the theoretical content
domain of autonomy (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Establishing content validity is
typically achieved by first rigorously defining the construct, then specifying a content
domain relevant to measuring the construct, and finally drawing a representative set of
items from that content domain and testing how they perform empirically.
To do so, we conducted two exploratory studies using a set of items adapted from the
autonomy literature in conjunction with the most commonly used EO measures (study 1)
as well as some relatively new EO items (study 2). Then, we employed a content adequacy
assessment method developed by Schriesheim and colleagues (Schriesheim, Cogliser,
Scandura, Lankau, & Powers, 1999; Schriesheim, Powers, Scandura, Gardiner, & Lankau,
1993), which has been increasingly employed to demonstrate content validity and multidimensionality of organizational measures such as work–family enrichment (e.g.,
Carlson, Kacmar, Wayne, & Grzywacz, 2006), benefit system satisfaction (e.g., Williams,
Malos, & Palmer, 2002), personal learning (e.g., Lankau & Scandura, 2002), organizational culture (e.g., Bluedorn, Kalliath, Strube, & Martin, 1999), and leader–member
exchange (e.g., Liden & Maslyn, 1998).

Item Pool Selection
The initial item pool was drawn from the scales discussed earlier. The goal of
preliminary screening (conducted by two of the authors) was to identify items that
reflected strategic rather than structural autonomy. As our earlier review suggested, there
was a preponderance of structural autonomy items, that is, those that emphasized issues
such as scheduling, work methods, and quality standards. Items that seemed appropriate
to an EO context were selected and adapted to a semantic differential format to be
consistent with previous EO scale items (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Lumpkin & Dess,
2001). Then, the revised item pool was shared with seven scholars who research EO topics
to obtain feedback about specific items. Based on their comments, we cut items and edited
the wording of others to develop the final set of items used in the two studies to be
discussed. The final eight items (shown in Table 2) were designed to be neutral with
regard to industry context and type of organization.

Procedure section, the task given to respondents requires them to make judgments regarding an item’s content in relation to theoretically defined categories. If our purpose was to
make generalizations about the relationships of EO with organizational outcomes to the
larger population, the use of undergraduate students may be questionable. However, as
noted by Schriesheim et al. (1993), the content adequacy method’s purpose is to generalize about theoretical relationships among the measure’s items:
From this perspective, it would seem that the only requirement for a set of judges to
be considered adequate for this task is that they possess sufficient intellectual ability
to perform the item rating task and that they be relatively free of serious potential
January, 2009

<-----Page 9----->biases. This suggests that college students may be highly appropriate for analyses like
the MSQ-S example presented earlier. They would be expected to have the capability
to read and understand the rating task instructions, items, and theoretical definitions.
In fact, it could be argued that the use of university faculty, employees or managers in
an industrial setting, etc. might be less desirable, since such samples might provide
ratings which are affected by learned perceptual biases (e.g., from reading relevant
theoretical or empirical literature, or from organizational socialization processes)
(Schriesheim et al., 1993, p. 407).
Schriesheim et al. (1993) report virtually identical results across undergraduate students, MBA students, and nonstudent managers. Accordingly, using students who are
naïve to EO models and their measures in our study is considered appropriate.
Surveys were distributed to 331 students across seven different business classes (four
undergraduate entrepreneurship classes, one undergraduate organizational behavior class,
and two MBA entrepreneurship classes) on the first day of classes. Students were given
written and verbal instructions on completing the survey. A total of 319 usable surveys
were returned (for a response rate of 96.3%). A majority were currently working (51.1%),
with average work experience of 3 to 4 years. Their average age was 22.4 years; 62% were
male, and the majority were white (75.9%; 12.5% were Hispanic, 6.6% were Asian, 3.8%
were African American, and .3 were Native American; .6% characterized themselves as
“other”). MBA students comprised 18.6% of this sample.
Procedure. Using the more cognitively simple yet robust procedure suggested by
Schriesheim and colleagues, respondents rated each of the survey items on whether the
content described in the items represents innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness (the
three most commonly used EO dimensions), or autonomy. We also provided a fifth option
(i.e., “none of these”) if the respondents could not identify an EO dimension. The
definitions (derived from Lumpkin & Dess, 1996) and instructions given were as follows:
Please read each statement carefully and categorize it into the category of entrepreneurial orientation it best fits, using the definitions we have provided below. Please
record your answer by putting an “x” in the appropriate column. Innovativeness is the
predisposition or tendency to engage in creativity and experimentation through
the introduction of new products/services as well as technological leadership via R&D
in new processes. Risk taking involves taking bold actions by venturing into the
unknown, borrowing heavily, and/or committing significant resources to ventures in
uncertain environments. Proactiveness is an opportunity-seeking, forward-looking
perspective characterized by the introduction of new products and services ahead of
the competition and acting in anticipation of future demand. Autonomy is the independent action undertaken by entrepreneurial leaders or teams directed at bringing
about a new venture and seeing it to fruition. Entrepreneurial behavior is often
generative and creative involving the autonomous actions of organizational actors.
The content adequacy procedure has not previously been used for semantic differential response formats; therefore, the two anchor statements were combined into one (an
approach that increased our confidence that the results would yield robust information
about dimensionality).

Item

New Autonomy Items:
*1
My firm supports the efforts of individuals and/or teams that work autonomously as compared with
requiring individuals and/or teams to rely on senior managers to guide their work.
2
My firm expects individuals/teams pursuing business opportunities to justify their actions throughout the
development process (as compared with encouraging them to proceed without having to justify their
actions at every stage of development)
3
The top managers of my firm believe that individuals or work groups operate independently and outside the
organizational chain of command to get the best results rather than operating within the traditional
hierarchy.
4
The top managers of my firm believe that individuals and/or teams are most effective if their goals and
performance targets are set by their supervisor(s) rather than if they set their own.
*5
The managers of my firm believe that the best results occur when individuals and/or teams decide for
themselves what business opportunities to pursue (rather than when the CEO and top managers provide
the primary impetus for pursuing business opportunities).
6
In my firm, individuals and/or teams are expected to use existing strategies and standard operating
procedures as a basis for decision making as compared with being encouraged to think “outside the box”
*7
In my firm, individuals and/or teams pursuing business opportunities make decisions on their own without
constantly referring to their supervisors (instead of having to obtain approval from their supervisors
before making decisions).
*8
In my firm, the CEO and top management team (rather than employee initiatives and input) play a major
role in identifying and selecting the entrepreneurial opportunities my firm pursues
Innovativeness Items:
9
In general, top managers of my firm favor a strong emphasis on the marketing of tried and true products
and services as compared with an emphasis on R & D, technological leadership, and innovations (Covin
& Slevin, 1989)
10
In the last five years, my firm has marketed no new lines of products or services as compared with very
many new product lines or services (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
11
In my firm, changes in product or service lines have been mostly of a minor nature as compared with being
quite dramatic (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
12
The top managers of my firm favor experimentation and original approaches to problem solving rather than
imitating methods that other firms have used for solving their problems (Lumpkin, 1998)
13
My firm prefers to design its own unique new processes and methods of production rather than adapting
methods and techniques that others have developed and proven (Lumpkin, 1998)

* Final set of Autonomy items.

Competitive Aggressiveness Items:
22
My firm is very aggressive and intensely competitive rather than making no special effort to take business
from the competition (Lumpkin & Dess, 2001)

Risk Taking Items:
18
The top managers of my firm have a strong proclivity for low risk projects (with normal and certain rates of
return) rather than high risk projects (with chances of very high return) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
19
The top managers of my firm believe that, owing to the nature of the environment, it is best to explore the
environment gradually via careful, incremental behavior (rather than bold, wide-ranging acts necessary to
achieve the firm’s objectives) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
20
When confronted with decision-making situations involving uncertainty, my firm typically adopts a
cautious, “wait-and-see” posture in order to minimize the probability of making costly decisions (as
compared with a bold, aggressive posture to maximize the probability of exploiting potential
opportunities) (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
21
The top managers of my firm prefer to study a problem thoroughly before deploying resources to solve it
instead of being quick to spend money on potential solutions if problems are holding us back (Lumpkin,
1998)

Proactiveness Items:
14
In dealing with competition, my firm typically responds to action which competitors initiate as compared
with initiating action which the competition then responds to (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
15
In dealing with competition, my firm is very seldom the first business to introduce new products/services,
administrative techniques and operating technologies (Covin & Slevin, 1989)
16
In dealing with competitors, my firm typically seeks to avoid competitive clashes, preferring a
“live-and-let-live” posture (rather than a competitive “undo-the-competitors” posture) (Covin & Slevin,
1989)
17
The top managers of my firm have a strong tendency to “follow the leader” in introducing new products or
ideas (rather than being ahead of other competitors in introducing novel ideas or practices) (Lumpkin &
Dess, 2001)

<-----Page 12----->by the EO dimension they were designed to measure; other than the new autonomy items
which are described in the next section, the citation for the original scale from which the
item was drawn is provided in parentheses following each item). Survey items were
randomly ordered in the questionnaire, and two versions of the survey instrument (reflecting different item ordering) were given to avoid order effects.
Autonomy. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, item 1 is a general autonomy item developed
from looking across the content of the research used to collect the extant scales. Items 2,
3, and 7 are based on content drawn from the Shane et al. (1995) ICS. Item 4 is adapted
from the GPI (Little, 1988). Item 5 is based on content from two sources (Gulowsen,
1972; Sprigg et al., 2000). Finally, two items (6 and 8) are drawn from the GSS (Hart,
1991). Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 represent strategic autonomy; items 3, 6, and 7 represent a
mix of strategic and structural autonomy. All the items were worded to reflect either the
firm or top management as the referent.
Innovativeness, Risk Taking, and Proactiveness. The 9-item Covin and Slevin (1989)
EO scale was used to measure these three dimensions. This scale is commonly used in EO
research, and prior studies have claimed it is psychometrically sound (e.g., Covin &
Slevin, 1986, 1989). These nine items appear in Table 3 as items 9 through 11 (innovativeness), 14 through 16 (proactiveness), and 18 through 20 (risk taking).

Analyses
Following Schriesheim and colleagues (1993, 1999), we first computed the number of
times the five categories were selected for each item to give a rough summary of the data.
These frequencies are presented in the “frequencies” columns of Table 3. Next, we
conducted a Q-type factor analysis on the data. Q-methodology is a means for quantitatively analyzing the subjective impressions of respondents who sort objects into theoretical categories for statistical purposes (McKeown & Thomas, 1988). Subjects respond to
test stimuli by assigning scores with respect to their internal frame of reference. In our
study, the stimuli presented to the subjects are the items to be rated; the subjects’ internal
frame of reference is conditioned by the definitions of the four dimensions of EO
presented to them.
The data matrix for our Q-factor analysis has K = 5 rows corresponding to the number
of categories rated by respondents (four a priori EO dimensions plus the “none of these”
category) and M = 17 columns corresponding to the number of items. We computed the
correlations among the items, based on each item’s frequency count for the five categories.
Next, we conducted a principal components factor analysis using eigenvalue > 1 and scree
plot criteria for retaining the number of factors. We used Varimax rotation (because the
four EO dimensions are theoretically distinct). As is typical in these types of analyses,
four principle components explained 100% of the variance (cf. Schriesheim et al., 1993);
however, only three factors had eigenvalues greater than one, so we interpreted only a
three-factor solution (cumulatively, the three factors explained 96.0% of the variance). We
used the criterion level of greater than |.40| suggested by Ford, MacCallum, and Tait (1986)
for identifying factor loadings relevant for interpretation. Loadings in these analyses reflect
similarities in the way the raters assigned the items to the five predefined categories.

Study 1 Results
We posit that EO includes a separate autonomy dimension, and will be supported
empirically if two conditions are satisfied: (1) the factor structure emerging from the
January, 2009

59

<-----Page 13----->Q-type factor analysis identifies an autonomy factor with high loadings on its factor and
small cross-loadings on the others (i.e., simple structure), and (2) the items identified in
the autonomy factor bear prima facie similarity to each other and in their correspondence
to the conceptual definition of autonomy (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).
The frequency columns (Table 3, study 1) present the number of times a category was
selected for a particular EO item; the factor columns present the factor analytic results.
The highest factor loadings are shown in italics. Items without data for study 1 were
included only in study 2.
Factor I. The set of items identified by factor I in Table 3 represents the autonomy
dimension and includes items 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. These five new items obtained the highest
frequency ratings on the autonomy dimension (ranging from 27 to 46 ratings for this
category) and had their highest loadings on factor I (and no loadings greater than |.40| on
the other factors). Loadings on factor I for these five items ranged from .83 to .99). The
content of these items reflects the a priori dimension they were designed to measure,
involving decision making at low versus top management levels in the firm and the use of
autonomy in strategy and goal setting.
Factor II. The next set of items has content that represents risk-taking and proactiveness
dimensions of EO. Five items had high rating counts for this dimension (of the items that
also had clean factor loadings; items 14, 16, 18, 19, and 20, with loadings ranging from
.75 to .93). There were no cross-loadings greater than |.40| on any of these items. Unlike
the autonomy items, four of the items that loaded on this factor (items 16, 18, 19, and 20)
received their highest categorization in the “none of these” category (indicating that
respondents felt the content reflected none of the EO dimensions defined). Of these four,
the second highest category was proactiveness (item 16) and risk taking (items 18, 19, and
20). Item 14 had its highest frequency count for the proactiveness dimension.
Factor III. As seen in Table 3, the content of the items in this factor reflect innovativeness. Item 9 had its highest frequency count for innovativeness; the frequency count for
item 11, however, was highest for the “none of these” category, with the second highest
frequency count for the innovativeness category. Factor loadings were .84 and .87 (for
items 9 and 11, respectively).
Cross-Loaded Items. Five items (3, 4, 6, 10, and 15) all obtained substantial cross-loadings
(greater than |.40| on two or more factors). Three of these items had their highest frequency
ratings on the “none of these” category, and a fourth had a fairly high frequency as well (item
4). Item 3 had a high frequency count for the autonomy factor (on which it loaded), but also
demonstrated a substantial cross-loading on factor II. As a set, these mixed-content items
represented all the EO dimensions, including autonomy, except for risk taking.

Study 2
Study 2 was conducted to replicate our results and to include the full range of
dimensions outlined by Lumpkin and Dess (1996): innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. Because our exploration of autonomy in
an EO context is theoretically driven, we wanted to be as comprehensive as possible
in reflecting current conceptualizations of EO. As noted recently by Grégoire, Noël, Déry,
and Béchard (2006), there is a lack of agreement across the EO literature about the
construct’s dimensionality. The most notable distinction lies between the three dimensions
60

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->used in study 1 (taken from Covin & Slevin, 1989) and the additional two dimensions
offered by Lumpkin and Dess. (Prior EO studies have used one-, two-, three-, and
five-dimensional conceptualizations and operationalizations of the construct.) While study
1 was designed to explore the autonomy dimension’s distinctiveness from the most
commonly used risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness dimensions, study 2 was
designed not only to replicate study 1, but to explore autonomy’s distinctiveness from risk
taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. Further, to be
comprehensive, study 2 also included additional items used in previous research to measure
EO dimensions as indicated in further discussion.
Sample. Respondents were undergraduate business and MBA students in two large public
universities in the United States. Surveys were distributed to 133 students across six
different business classes (two undergraduate entrepreneurship classes, three MBA entrepreneurship classes, and one MBA negotiation class; differences across classes were not
found). A total of 125 usable surveys were returned. Over half were currently working
(55.3%), and averaged 3 to 4 years of work experience. Average age was 24.5 years old
(standard deviation = 8.0) and the sample was comprised of 71.2% males. The majority
were white (85.6%); 6.4% were Hispanic, 3.2% were Asian, 2.4 were Native American,
.8% were African American, and 1.6% characterized themselves as “other”). MBA students comprised 45.5% of our study 2 sample.
Procedure. The procedure for this study was identical to that employed in study 1, except
that we had a larger item pool (including items that were written to measure competitive
aggressiveness in addition to the dimensions explored in the first study) which added a
fifth rating category—compeititive aggressiveness. We again provided a “none of these”
option if the respondents could not identify the type of EO behavior indicated. The
definition included for competitive aggressiveness was “the intensity of a firm’s efforts
to outperform rivals and is characterized by a strong offensive posture or aggressive
responses to the actions of competitors” (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996).

Measures
Autonomy, Innovativeness, Risk Taking, and Proactiveness. The same items used in
study 1 were used for study 2, plus four additional items. Two items developed for a
previous study (Lumpkin, 1998) were included (items 12 and 13 in Table 3) to address
important process aspects of innovation not captured by the Covin and Slevin scale such
as experimentation and novelty. Item 17 was added to capture proactiveness content (used
by Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). An additional risk-taking item (item 21) from Lumpkin
(1998) was also included in the current study.
Competitive Aggressiveness. Looking at the item content of the study 1 measures, we
expected item 16 (in Table 3) would more accurately assess the competitive aggressiveness dimension, and wanted to test this in our current study. An additional competitive
aggressiveness item—(#22 in Table 3), from Lumpkin and Dess (2001)—was also
included in the current study.

Analyses
We used the same strategy as study 1, first computing the number of times the five
dimensions and “none of these” were selected for each item to give a rough summary of
the data. These frequencies are presented in the study 2 section of Table 3.
January, 2009

61

<-----Page 15----->Q-type factor analysis was then conducted on a data matrix with K = 6 rows (number
of categories rated by respondents) and M = 22 columns (the number of items rated). Four
factors had eigenvalues greater than one, and we again used the > |.40| criterion for
identifying factor loadings as meaningful and relevant for interpretation. The loadings
shown in the right-hand columns of Table 3 reflect similarities in the way the raters
assigned the items to the six categories.

Study 2 Results
The frequency column in Table 3 presents the number of times a category was
selected for a particular EO item. The factor columns on the far right present the factor
analytic results.
Factor I. The first factor has item content reflective of at least two EO dimensions
(innovativeness and proactiveness). However, all five items that loaded on this factor had
the highest frequency counts on the “none of these” category, rather than on an EO
category. Items 9, 10, 11, and 15 had their second-highest counts on the innovativeness
dimension. Item 17 obtained the second-highest counts on the proactiveness dimension
(this was a new item designed to assess proactiveness). Factor loadings ranged from .89
to .95, with no cross-loadings over |.40|.
Factor II. All items that loaded on factor II were designed to measure autonomy. Each of
these five items (1, 3, 5, 7, and 8) had the highest frequency counts on the autonomy
dimension (and also obtained relatively low frequency counts for the “none” category).
Loadings on factor II ranged from .88 to .96. The set of items was identical to study 1
except for item 3 (“The top managers of my firm believe that individuals or work groups
operate independently and outside the organizational chain of command . . .”), which
replaced item 2 on this factor in study 1 (“My firm expects individuals/teams pursuing
business opportunities to justify their actions . . .”).
Factor III. Looking at item content in Table 3, we believe the third factor indicates risk
taking and/or proactiveness. One item (18) had its highest frequency count for risk taking
(along with “none”). However, a second item (21) obtained the highest number of ratings
on the proactiveness dimension (followed by “none” and then “risk taking”). The loadings
for these two items on factor III were .78 and .80, with no cross-loadings.
Factor IV. Only one item loaded on factor 4 (item 14). This item clearly represents
competitive aggressiveness, with the highest frequency counts on this dimension (and a
factor loading of .91).
Cross-Loaded Items. Nine remaining items (items 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, and 22) had
substantial cross-loadings (over |.40|). Five had high “none” ratings (items 4, 5, 16, 19, and
20). Four items obtained the highest number of ratings on the substantive EO dimensions.
Items 12 and 13 had the highest counts on innovativeness, item 2 had its highest count on
autonomy, and item 22 had its highest count on competitive aggressiveness.

Discussion
Autonomy refers to the ability to work independently, make decisions, and take
actions aimed at bringing forth a business concept or vision and carrying it through to
62

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->completion (Kanter, 1983; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Based on this definition, autonomy in
an EO context is clearly a vital aspect of entrepreneurial value creation and central to the
notion of strategic entrepreneurship. Autonomy may not be an issue among independently
owned and managed entrepreneurial firms because such founders are already acting
autonomously. In a corporate setting, however, autonomy provides organization members
with the freedom and independence needed to pursue entrepreneurial activities. The
autonomy of corporate entrepreneurs is not a given or held constant; instead, it is a scarce
capability that is granted to organizational members, and cannot be assumed but must be
perpetually negotiated (Bouchard, 2002). In settings where it is encouraged and permitted
to thrive, research indicates that autonomy is an important element of new venture
development and growth (Burgelman, 1983, 2001).
Given the importance of autonomy, why have so few studies addressed the effect of
autonomy on entrepreneurial outcomes? One reason is that prior management research
has tended to investigate autonomy as it relates to work method issues such as production
methods, scheduling, or the physical layout of the workplace. An EO perspective on
autonomy, by contrast, suggests decision making and action outside of the organizational
chain of command involving choices about entrepreneurial initiatives that have strategic
implications. Few existing autonomy scales address this type of autonomy. A key purpose
of this paper, therefore, is to clarify the autonomy dimension theoretically as well as to
propose and test an EO-based autonomy scale.
Theoretical advances in a field depend on the existence of well-defined constructs
and their psychometrically sound measures. This is particularly important for entrepreneurship research, which is currently in a significant growth stage (Busenitz et al.,
2003), yet still suffers from deficient construct measurement and research design in
some arenas (Aldrich & Baker, 1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001). However, such shortcomings are not limited to entrepreneurship scholarship; scant attention to psychometric
properties of scales is widespread as previous reviews on construct measurement in the
more general management domain have shown (e.g., Hinkin, 1995; Schriesheim et al.,
1993). Schriesheim et al. report that there is marginal attention paid to construct validity
(usually exploratory or confirmatory factor analyses of respondents to measures), but
rarely was any form of content validity assessment done (which is not focused on
substantive empirical relationships but instead considers the item content domain of a
particular scale). Of additional concern to us in the present context is that the lack of
attention to content validity is more apparent in studies involving macrolevel constructs
(e.g., no content validity checks were done in studies included in the Schriesheim
et al. review of Strategic Management Journal as compared with the Academy
of Management Journal, which includes both micro- and macro-oriented studies).
These concerns provided a catalyst for this research. Our purpose was to theoretically
examine the distinct role of autonomy in EO processes and provide a first step toward
developing a psychometrically sound measure of firm-level autonomy. The first
objective was accomplished through the conceptual development at the beginning of
this article; the latter goal was addressed through our content adequacy assessment
studies.
Our analyses provide support for the content validity of our proposed measure,
suggesting that autonomy is a separate dimension of EO and not isomorphic with the other
EO dimensions. Our content adequacy assessment indicates that our application often
eliminates troublesome scale items that we believe will yield final scales that have factor
structures in subsequent empirical research that will be congruent with the theoretical
construct dimensions of EO they were designed to measure. Across both studies, four
of the items we designed to measure autonomy sorted cleanly onto a separate factor,
January, 2009

<-----Page 17----->providing a set of items (in italics in Table 2) that are content valid yet warrant further
construct validation in future EO research.

Implications for Future Research
There are several contributions and implications for researchers from our study. Based
on our theoretical investigation of different types of autonomy and the components of
different autonomy scales, we feel our efforts have yielded an important first step in tapping
into the type of autonomy that is relevant to EO research. While our content adequacy
assessment represents an advance over current practice and has yielded a content valid
four-item firm-level autonomy scale, this analysis is not a substitute for continued rigorous
construct validation. The autonomy scale’s construct validation process should include
tests of discriminant validity and concurrent (or predictive) validity with other constructs
in the EO nomological net, employing robust confirmatory methods to both demonstrate
the multidimensionality of the EO construct as a whole, as well as refine the measures
for the individual dimensions. For example, as a result of the importance of the
EO–performance relationship in prior research, the relationship between autonomy and
performance should be investigated. Do higher levels of EO-based autonomy have different
relationships with performance? Is the relationship a linear one or might higher-order
models apply, implying diminishing returns from very high levels of autonomy?
Future validation studies should also explore potential context effects, looking into the
differences in autonomy for a corporate versus small-business or independent firm. Is
autonomy contingent on organizational or environmental factors? What factors inhibit or
strengthen the relationship between autonomy and firm performance? Finally, what is the
relationship between autonomy and the other individual dimensions of EO? For example,
is the relationship between autonomy and innovativeness actually curvilinear as suggested
by Gebert, Boerner, and Lanwehr (2003)? As an extension, our proposed autonomy scale
should be included in a composite EO scale to enable researchers to better investigate each
unique dimension as it pertains to EO, as well as to further research as it pertains to the
EO–performance relationship.
Our empirical findings regarding the other dimensions of EO are somewhat troubling
and provide a number of research challenges. In particular, our two sets of analyses
identified a number of items with cross-loadings that indicate either problems in the
conceptual definitions of the EO construct or problems with scale items used quite often in
measuring EO, or both. We hope our findings regarding the dimensions of EO discussed in
this study will spur the continued development of a more comprehensive theory of EO.
Future research should address the nomological network and multifaceted relationships
of the effects of this important construct on various measures of organizational outcomes
and/or venture success as well as direct attention toward improvement in construct
measurement. Such an inquiry would represent a response to researchers who have called
on the field to address deficiencies in entrepreneurship research (Aldrich & Baker, 1997;
Chandler & Lyon, 2001; Low & MacMillan, 1988; Wortman, 1987). In particular, we
believe more cogent construct definition and clearer explications of the salient EO dimensions would advance theoretical developments in this research domain. Further, we believe
our approach to examining the autonomy dimension provides a sound and useful approach
to future development of the EO construct and subsequent refinement of its measures.

Implications for Practice
The findings of our study also have important implications for entrepreneurial practice, both in new ventures and for those with an EO in corporations. We believe it
64

<-----Page 18----->is potentially problematic for researchers to prescribe specific interventions to achieve
organizational or venture success based on a unidimensional conceptualization of EO.
A singular conceptualization could not distinguish between the effects of, for instance,
autonomy and innovativeness. If new venture failure is caused by a lack of autonomy of
firm members, it is implausible to believe that it could be rectified by an increased level
of innovativeness. In contrast, a conceptualization of EO with clearly defined subdimensions offers the possibility of prescribing more finely tuned sets of activities to deliver
specific new venture success outcomes. Because one of the primary goals of measurement
is precision of prediction, a focus on an accurate understanding of the various dimensions
of EO can lead to clear, meaningful, and useful prescriptions for entrepreneurs.

Conclusion
Autonomous decision making and action can provide a vital avenue for achieving
strategic advantages and entrepreneurial outcomes. Nevertheless, autonomy has received
less attention in prior EO research than factors such as innovativeness, proactiveness, or
risk taking. Our review of the literature on autonomy has produced a refined definition
for the construct as it applies in an EO context and a strong first step toward measuring
this important entrepreneurial orientation dimension. We believe the finer-grained elaboration of this construct can help spur less equivocal and more relevant research findings.
Although more work is needed to provide a robust, well-validated set of measures for the
dimensions of EO and ensure greater consistency across studies of EO, the study provides
an important step in understanding autonomy and its relationship with new venture
success and organizational outcomes.
