This study traces the origins of innovative strategies by examining the attributes of ‘innovative
entrepreneurs.’ In an inductive grounded theory study of innovative entrepreneurs, we develop
a theory that innovative entrepreneurs differ from executives on four behavioral patterns
through which they acquire information: (1) questioning; (2) observing; (3) experimenting;
and (4) idea networking. We develop operational measures of each of these behaviors and
find significant differences between innovative entrepreneurs and executives in a large sample
survey of 72 successful and unsuccessful innovative entrepreneurs and 310 executives. Drawing
on network theory, we develop a theory of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition that
explains why these behaviors increase the probability of generating an idea for an innovative
venture. We contend that one’s ability to generate novel ideas for innovative new businesses
is a function of one’s behaviors that trigger cognitive processes to produce novel business
ideas. We also posit that innovative entrepreneurs are less susceptible to the status quo bias
and engage in these information-seeking behaviors with a motivation to change the status quo.

INTRODUCTION
One of the central questions addressed in the field
of entrepreneurship is why entrepreneurs recognize
opportunities that nonentrepreneurs fail to recognize. (Baron, 2004, 2007; Kaish and Gilad, 1991;
Shane, 2003). Because entrepreneurs play a central
role in new venture creation, comparisons of entrepreneurs and managers have been prevalent in prior
entrepreneurship research as scholars have sought
to identify the distinguishing characteristics of

entrepreneurs. The three most popular explanations
of why entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs differ in
this ability are personality differences, cognitive
differences, and social network differences.
The research on personality or psychological differences has, to the surprise of many, found that
successful entrepreneurs and successful business
executives do not differ significantly on personality
traits (Brockhaus and Horwitz, 1986; Busenitz and
Barney, 1997). In the psychological differences literature, a wide variety of individual psychological
attributes, including locus of control and risk taking,
have been shown to not vary significantly between
entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations
(Begley and Boyd, 1987; Brockhaus, 1980). Some
relatively small but consistent psychological differences—such as the need for achievement, tolerance
for ambiguity, and the need for conformity—have

<-----Page 1----->318

been found in some studies (Begley and Boyd, 1987;
Miner, Smith and Bracker,1989). According to
Busenitz and Barney (1997: 11) ‘After a great deal
of research it is now often concluded that most of
the psychological differences between entrepreneurs
and managers in large organizations are small or
nonexistent’ (Brockhaus and Horwitz, 1986; Low
and MacMillan, 1988).
Although there has been little empirical support
for personality differences between entrepreneurs
and nonentrepreneurs, there has been some emerging empirical support for cognitive differences and
social network differences. For example, research
has shown that entrepreneurs are prone to cognitive
biases, notably the overconfidence bias and representativeness bias (Busenitz and Barney, 1997;
Parlich and Bagby, 1995). These biases do not
appear to directly influence opportunity recognition,
but rather seem to motivate entrepreneurs to persist
in pursuing new venture ideas, thereby increasing
the probability of venture creation (Busenitz and
Barney, 1997). A related stream of research on cognition has suggested that entrepreneurs recognize
opportunities because they are superior at pattern
recognition—noticing connections between trends,
changes, and events that appear, at first glance, to be
unconnected (Baron, 2006). While the notion that
entrepreneurs have better pattern recognition skills
than nonentrepreneurs is intuitively appealing, there
is limited empirical research to support this premise.
Finally, social network theorists have argued that the
structure of one’s social relationships determines the
quantity of information, the quality of information,
and how rapidly people can acquire the information
necessary to discover entrepreneurial opportunities
(Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986; Marsden, 1983; Rodan
and Galunic, 2004; Uzzi and Spiro, 2005). Entrepreneurs may have superior access to information
because they have larger and more diverse social
networks that provide a conduit for information,
thereby allowing them to recognize opportunities.
Empirical research supports the premise that entrepreneurs have more diverse social networks than
nonentrepreneurs (Renzulli, Aldrich, and Moody,
2000; Burt and Raider, 2002; Stuart and Ding, 2006).
However, Stuart and Sorenson (2007) caution that
social networks may enhance venture creation
because they enhance resource mobilization, not
necessarily opportunity recognition.
Building on the more behavioral approach of
social network researchers, the research in this
article focuses on the behaviors that innovative
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

entrepreneurs engage in that may enable them to
identify new venture opportunities. Gartner (1989:
57) has argued for a more behavioral approach to
entrepreneurship research claiming that ‘research on
the entrepreneur should focus on what the entrepreneur does, not who the entrepreneur is.’ Using a
grounded theory approach, this article inductively
identifies several of these specific behaviors through
indepth interviews with innovative entrepreneurs
and individuals who work with them. Then, using
survey methods, we compare the extent to which a
sample of innovative entrepreneurs display these
behaviors compared to a sample of managers. Consistent with grounded theory, these behaviors are
much more common and pronounced among innovative entrepreneurs than among managers, including senior managers, in large organizations. Through
this process, we develop a theory regarding behavioral patterns that contribute to innovative entrepreneurs’ ability to recognize opportunities for new
venture creation.

THEORY DEVELOPMENT
Definition of opportunity recognition
The notion of entrepreneurs recognizing opportunities has led to a threefold categorization (Sarasvathy
et al., 2003; Miller, 2007) of how this occurs:
(1) opportunity recognition refers to connecting
known products with existing demand to exploit a
previously recognized opportunity; (2) opportunity
discovery starts with a known supply and proceeds
in search of an unknown demand, or from a known
demand that motivates search for an unknown
supply; and (3) with opportunity creation, neither
the supply nor demand exists prior to entrepreneurial
action—the entrepreneur participates in creating
both. We use recognize opportunities or opportunity
recognition to refer to all three processes for starting
an innovative business, even though we believe that
technically speaking the innovative entrepreneurs
we study are more likely to engage in opportunity
discovery or opportunity creation since they
are introducing something new to the market
(Sarasvathy et al. 2003; Miller, 2007).
Definition of innovative entrepreneur
Most prior research has examined differences
between entrepreneurs (defined as anyone who
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 2----->Entrepreneur Behaviors
founds a business) versus managers or executives
(mostly in large organizations), rather than innovative entrepreneurs. As a result, findings regarding
entrepreneurs may not necessarily translate to innovative entrepreneurs. Building on Cliff, Jennings,
and Greenwood’s (2006) study of imitative versus
innovative entrepreneurs (i.e., founders of firms that
exhibit novelty) we define an innovative entrepreneur (IE) as: (1) the founder of a new venture that
offered a unique value proposition relative to incumbents (e.g., new or different feature set, pricing, convenience, customizability); and (2) the person who
came up with the original idea to start the venture.
The classic definition of an entrepreneur is anyone
who starts a new venture (Lazear, 2004). When
someone opens a dry cleaner or a new mortgage
business—or even a set of Toyota dealerships or
McDonald’s franchises—researchers typically put
them all in the same category of entrepreneur as the
founders of innovative new ventures such as Pierre
Omidyar (eBay), Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com), and
Steve Jobs (Apple)—individuals we would classify
as innovative entrepreneurs. Prior research suggests
that only a relatively small percentage of all entrepreneurs start innovative ventures (Case, 1989;
Bhide, 2000). For example, Bhide (2000:32) reports
that only 12 percent of the founders of 100 high
profile start-ups identified in Inc. magazine attributed their companies’ success to an unusual or
extraordinary idea and 88 percent reported their
success mainly to the exceptional execution of an
ordinary idea.
Recognizing/discovering innovative new
venture ideas
Why might some individuals be more likely to recognize or discover an opportunity to launch an innovative new venture? This is a fundamental question
for the field of entrepreneurship because opportunity
recognition is the catalyst for the entrepreneurial
process. Thus, it is not surprising that opportunity
recognition has long been a central concept in the
field of entrepreneurship. However, according to
Baron (2007: 170) until recently ‘little effort was
made to examine it as a process.’ Indeed, Baron
(2007: 170) claims that prior research ‘largely
ignores the question of how opportunity recognition
occurs; in other words, how do specific persons
actually identify opportunities?’
Research on this topic to date has tended to focus
on two categories of factors—access to information

(differences in search behavior or social networks)
and cognition (differences in pattern recognition
abilities and alertness). Prior research suggests that
individuals may recognize opportunities to start ventures because they have superior access to information due to differentiated search behavior or social
networks. Not surprisingly, the more time one spends
searching for and assimilating information, the
greater the probability that he/she will serendipitously discover a new business opportunity. Empirical support for the relationship between search
behavior and opportunity recognition is offered by
Kaish and Gilad (1991) who found that entrepreneurs spend significantly more time searching for
information through nonverbal scanning and in
their off hours. Unfortunately, there is still limited
research on entrepreneurs’ search behaviors, particularly those specific behavioral patterns that
might contribute disproportionately to opportunity
recognition.
Social network theorists have argued that the
structure of one’s social relationships determines the
quantity of information, the quality of information,
and how rapidly people can acquire the information
necessary to discover entrepreneurial opportunities
(Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986; Marsden, 1983). Recent
studies provide empirical support for the importance
of diverse social networks to new venture creation.
For example, Renzulli et al.(2000) found that wouldbe entrepreneurs with networks that spanned multiple domains of social life founded new firms with
greater frequency. Similarly, Burt and Raider (2002)
studied female graduates from a prestigious MBA
program and found higher rates of transitioning to
self-employment among those with diverse social
networks. However, while there is empirical evidence suggesting that individuals with more diverse
social networks are more likely to start new ventures, Stuart and Sorenson (2007: 218) offer a caution
with regard to interpreting a casual relationship
between diverse social networks and opportunity
recognition by saying ‘we should note that most
studies of egocentric network structure and entrepreneurial activity examine aggregate data in which the
researcher cannot distinguish the network’s effect
on opportunity identification from its influence on
resource mobilization . . . We consider the evidence
to date to fall short of establishing as a stylized
fact the idea that diverse networks (those rich in
structural holes) enhance opportunity recognition.’
Access to information is likely to be an incomplete explanation for why some people are able to
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 3----->320

J. H. Dyer, H. B Gregersen, and C. Christensen

discover innovative new business opportunities
because, according to Shane and Eckhardt (2003:
175) ‘opportunities are identified only when people
formulate a new means-ends framework in response
to that information.’ How does opportunity recognition actually occur in the minds of specific entrepreneurs? According to Baron (2007: 171) ‘one
cognitive process investigated by cognitive scientists—pattern recognition1—appears to be closely
related to opportunity recognition in the domain
of entrepreneurship.’ Baron (2006: 171) builds on
prior psychological research (e.g., Sternberg and
Davidson, 1995) by noting that pattern recognition
involves ‘noticing meaningful patterns in complex
events trends, or changes and includes: (1) recognizing links between trends, changes, and events that
appear, at first glance, to be unconnected; and (2)
noticing that these connections form an identifiable
pattern.’ Unfortunately, given the difficulty of measuring pattern recognition capabilities in individual
entrepreneurs, little empirical support exists. Moreover, we have little understanding of why some
individuals may have superior pattern recognition
capabilities or what might be the catalyst (antecedent) for pattern recognition.

INDUCTIVE STUDY:
RESEARCH METHODS
Sample
The purpose of our inductive grounded theory study
was to attempt to answer two questions: what
contributes to an innovative entrepreneur’s ability
to recognize an innovative new business idea, and
do innovative entrepreneurs differ from typical
executives on any particular behavioral dimensions.
To explore possible answers to these questions, we
conducted semistructured interviews with a sample
of 25 innovative entrepreneurs (see Table 1) and 25
senior executives of large companies. The definition
of an innovative entrepreneur was provided in the
theory development section.
Our sample of innovative entrepreneurs came
from using three different approaches. First, we
identified innovative ventures by examining a list of

concepts (ideas, problems, fields of study, events, and trends)
that appear, at first glance, to be unconnected.

the top 100 innovative companies as identified
through a survey of executives by Business Week
and the Boston Consulting Group (Business Week,
2005, 2006, 2007). We then identified and contacted
founders of a subset of those companies that offered
a unique value proposition when they launched. This
included a set of very high profile innovative entrepreneurs such as Pierre Omidyar (eBay), Jeff Bezos
(Amazon.com), Michael Dell (Dell), Mike Lazaridis
(Research-in-Motion), Herb Kelleher (Southwest),
Marc Benioff (Salesforce.com), Scott Cook (Intuit),
David Neeleman (JetBlue), Diane Greene (VMware),
Niklas Zennstrom (Skype), and Peter Thiel (PayPal).
This was not a random sample of innovative entrepreneurs, but rather of founders of at least one highly
successful new venture (but they often had also
launched failed innovative ventures as well). The
majority of these interviews were conducted over
the phone and the interviews were taped and
transcribed.
Second, we identified innovative entrepreneurs
who were visiting two business schools in the
eastern United States, one in the western United
States, and one in Europe. These IEs were typically
visiting one of these universities to give a talk or
attend a conference or seminar on entrepreneurship.
These innovative entrepreneurs had typically
founded at least one innovative venture that was
moderately successful and included Mike Collins
(Big Idea Group), Jeff Jones (CampusPipeline,
NxLight), Aaron Garrity (Xango), and John Pestana
and Josh James (Omniture). This sample of innovative entrepreneurs is a convenience sample that primarily includes somewhat successful innovative
entrepreneurs.
Third, we identified innovative entrepreneurs who
were attending executive education or executive
MBA programs at the business schools mentioned
above. The majority of these innovative entrepreneurs had founded ventures that had failed or perhaps
had been moderately successful (hence, they were
enrolled in an executive MBA program or participating in an executive program). This group included
innovative entrepreneurs like Sam Allen (ScanCafe),
Corey Wride (MovieMouth), and Spencer Moffat
(Fast Arch of Utah).
The sample of senior executives (title of vice
president or above) came primarily from executives
who were visiting the previously mentioned business schools to give a talk or attend an event. At least
10 of the senior executive interviewees were CEOs
of billion dollar companies and virtually all were

viewed as successful. While this was a convenience
sample, we consider it to be essentially a random
sample because these executives came from all different types of industries and no criteria was used to
screen senior executives.

Methods
We conducted exploratory interviews, comparing
the innovative entrepreneurs’ and executives’
responses to the following questions:
1) Tell us about the most valuable strategic
insight/novel business idea that you’ve generated during your business career. Please
describe the details of the idea. (For example,
how was it novel and how did you come up
with the idea?)
2) In your opinion, do you have any particular
skills that are important to helping you generate novel business ideas? Do you think the
skills you have that have enabled you to be
creative/ innovative (start an innovative
business) are just part of your genetic makeup?
Or do you think much of this ability was
learned?
3) Are there any techniques you use or habits you
have developed to help you come up with
innovative ideas?
The goal of our interviews with the innovative
entrepreneurs was to understand as much about them
as possible, including when and how they personally
came up with the creative ideas on which new innovative businesses were built. To get an outside perspective, we also interviewed senior executives who
were well acquainted with the innovative entrepreneur whenever possible. For example, we interviewed Dell CEO Kevin Rollins about Michael Dell
and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman about eBay
founder Pierre Omidyar. We also interviewed the
founders of Skype (Niklas Zennstrom and Janus
Friis) and PayPal (Peter Thiel), with whom Whitman
became well acquainted when eBay acquired those
companies. We augmented our -interviews with the
high-profile entrepreneurs with a review of other
interviews they had given or articles or books they
had written.
As we conducted the interviews with innovative
entrepreneurs and executives, we used the constant
comparative method as described by Browning,
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

Beyer, and Shetler (1995: 121) to extract categories
and themes from the interviews.
‘As the research proceeds and new data are collected, they are constantly being compared to
prior data in terms of categories and hypotheses.
When new data yield new or inconsistent information, conceptual categories and the emerging
theory are modified to take them into account.
This process is repeated until theoretical saturation is reached: until no new categories are emerging and no new information inconsistent with
the categories and tentative hypotheses is being
generated’ (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and
Corbin, 1990).
Through the interviews with both the innovative
entrepreneurs and managers, we identified four
behavioral patterns that seemed to be more pronounced in IEs than managers. Moreover, the behaviors were often direct antecedents to the innovative
entrepreneur generating the novel business idea.
In particular, innovative entrepreneurs were more
likely to exhibit behavioral patterns that involved:
(1) questioning, or their propensity to frequently ask
questions, particularly those that challenge the status
quo and ask what if about the future; (2) observing,
or the extent to which they spend time intensely
observing the world around them, paying attention
to everyday experiences to find new ideas; (3) experimenting, or the frequency with which they experiment in and explore the world with a hypothesis-testing
mindset: visiting new places, trying new things,
seeking new information, and experimenting to learn
new things, as experimenters constantly explore the
world intellectually and experientially, holding convictions at bay, testing hypotheses along the way;
and (4) idea networking, or the extent to which they
actively find and test ideas with a network of individuals who are diverse in both background and
perspective. Moreover, the innovative entrepreneur
would often refer to one or more of these behavior
patterns as an important habit or technique that was
used to increase the probability of generating an
innovative idea. Senior executives did not report
engaging in these behavioral patterns to the same
extent as the innovative entrepreneurs. Data collection was concluded when a level of saturation
was reached (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Burgelman,
1994). This study is subject to the general limitations
of generalizability associated with field research,
which are well documented (see Eisenhardt, 1989).

In the sections that follow, we provide quotes
from many of the innovative entrepreneurs we interviewed. Although the names of interviewees in this
type of research are typically not disclosed, we have
decided to disclose the names of all interviewees
who are quoted because many of them are well
known and we feel that most readers will find the
source of the quote to be of interest.

INDUCTIVE STUDY: RESULTS
When analyzing the data from the IE interviews,
four consistent behaviors and two cognitive patterns
emerged as relevant to acquisition of information
that could potentially be used in the generation of
novel ideas for new ventures. The four behaviors
were questioning, observing, experimenting, and
idea networking. The two cognitive patterns were
associational thinking (or pattern recognition) and
a desire to change the status quo.
Questioning
Most IEs relied on questioning behavior as a key
behavioral mechanism for acquiring information
that led to a new venture idea. Of course, both managers and executives claimed they used questions in
their work. However, IEs were more likely to ask
questions that challenged the status quo, whereas the
questions asked by managers were much more about
understanding how to make existing processes (i.e.,
the status quo) work a little better. Meg Whitman,
former CEO of eBay, has worked directly with a
number of innovative entrepreneurs in our sample,
including Pierre Omidyar (eBay founder), Niklas
Zennstrom and Janus Friis (founders of Skype and
Kazaa), and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk (founders of
PayPal). When asked how these folks differ from
typical executives Whitman said ‘My experience is
that they get a kick out of screwing up the status quo.
They can’t bear it. So they spend a tremendous
amount of time thinking about how to change the
world. And as they think and brainstorm, they like
to ask if we did this, what would happen?’ During
our interviews with executives, they less frequently
mentioned asking what if questions and some
claimed they were even careful to not openly ask
questions that challenge their company’s strategy or
business model. As one executive stated, ‘If I openly
question our strategy or key initiatives this could
create a crises of confidence within the company.
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

323

People don’t like that kind of uncertainty and it can
paralyze the organization.’
Most innovative entrepreneurs could identify
specific questions they were asking at the time
they recognized the new venture opportunity. For
example, part of Michael Dell’s initial opportunity
recognition in the computer industry resulted from
a single question asked with deep interest: ‘I was a
frustrated consumer, and I would open computers
up, I’d take them apart; I knew what was inside them
and would observe that $600 worth of parts were
sold for $3,000. That didn’t make any sense to
me. I really questioned why it cost five times more
to buy the darn thing than the parts cost.’
Such questioning also seemed to influence part of
Dell’s top management team dynamic as illustrated
in this comment about Michael Dell’s working
dynamics with former CEO Kevin Rollins: ‘Kevin
gave me a toy bulldozer driven by a little girl with a
huge smile on her face. Sometimes I’ll get really
excited about an idea and I’ll just start driving it.
Kevin put the bulldozer on my desk, and it’s a signal
to me to say wait a second, I need to push it a little
more and think through it for some others and kind
of slow down on this great idea that I’m working on.’
I gave Kevin a Curious George stuffed animal. The
Curious George is for Kevin to ask questions, to be
a little more inquisitive. We don’t use them that
much, but they’re subtle little jokes between us.’
Finally, not only did Dell describe his attempts to
prod his CEO counterpart into more questioning, but
he also shared how he worked to extend questioning
behavior beyond the TMT: ‘If I had a favorite question to ask, everyone would anticipate it, which
wouldn’t make it very good. Instead, I like to ask
people things that they don’t think that I’m going to
ask them. This is a little cruel, but I kind of delight
in coming up with questions that nobody has the
answer to quite yet. But it challenges them and they
have to go back and think about it.’
Other innovative entrepreneurs also viewed questioning (either implicitly or explicitly) as central to
their capacity for innovative idea generation. For
example, Jeff Jones (founder Campus Pipeline,
NxLight) made the observation that ‘I think there’s
a certain personality type that just keeps asking why.
Like my two-year-old son, they ask why, why, why?
They don’t stop. Once you discover that asking why
in a different way and not being content with what
the answer is, it’s interesting what happens. You
just have to go a little bit deeper asking questions
one or two more times in a different way.’

J. H. Dyer, H. B Gregersen, and C. Christensen

Pierre Omidyar (eBay founder) also framed questioning as a mechanism for generating counterintuitive responses:
‘When addressing a new problem where there’s
sort of conventional wisdom or consensus around
a particular thing, I will often test out the opposite.
I’m always the devil’s advocate in the room. You
know, Well what if it really didn’t work this way?
Or what if we really did do the opposite of this?
What would happen? I have been this way since
I was a kid. I’ve always been the devil’s advocate,
slightly argumentative. My learning process has
always been around disagreeing with what I’m
being told and taking the opposite position and
pushing and asking questions, and pushing others
to really justify themselves. I remember it was
frustrating, very frustrating, for the other kids
when you do this.’
Mark Wattles (Hollywood Entertainment) also said
he relies heavily on questioning:
‘In my company, I try to get everybody to ask
why. It’s easier to do it with young people than
for somebody who’s a seasoned vet in business.
You take some of these executives who have been
doing the same thing for 20 years and, yes they’re
valuable, but they don’t tend to come up with
anything new. You know why? Because they stop
using their minds because they’ve moved into this
execution mode which is a necessity to make a
company work, but they stop really thinking.
Young people though don’t yet know what to do
and it forces them to think. I tell them when you
come to an organization, just ask why. Now you
need to understand the appropriate places to ask
why because you can’t be wasting a bunch of
people’s time, but don’t accept anything at face
value. Just ask yourself why and try to figure it
out. It’s the what ifs and whys that make all the
difference.’
In the same way, Herb Kelleher (Southwest) suggested the potential power of soliciting challenging
questions from subordinates. ‘I just watch, I listen.
And I want them to ask me questions. I want them
to ask me tough questions. I want them to ask me
their toughest questions.’
Overall, compared to executives, IEs in this
study asked more questions that were targeted at
surfacing underlying assumptions (individual, team,
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

organizational, and societal) as well as directly challenging the status quo. As Xango founder Aaron
Garrity observed, ‘I am questioning, always questioning, with a revolutionary mindset.’ For IEs these
questions appeared to increase their capacity to see
or initiate new ventures.
Proposition 1: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs more
frequently ask questions, particularly those that
challenge the status quo.
Observing
A second behavioral pattern that emerged from our
interviews was intense observation in novel situations as well as ordinary encounters. Such observations often engaged multiple senses and were
frequently associated with the existence of compelling questions. Mike Collins (founder and CEO of
Big Idea Group) explained that ‘the most successful
inventors have incredible observation skills. It isn’t
just a one day aha day. It happens all of the time.
They are observing the world around them and
asking questions all the time. It’s part of who they
are. For other people, it is an untapped skill.’ Our
interviews seemed to bear out the persistency of
this pattern.
To illustrate, Howard Shultz kept his eyes and
ears open to hit on the idea for Starbucks by observing the characteristics of espresso bars in Italy.
During a trip to Milan, Italy, to attend an international housewares trade show, Schultz decided to
walk to the trade show, which was 15 minutes from
his hotel. Just as he started off, he noticed a little
espresso bar. He ducked inside to look around. After
drinking an espresso, he continued on and a block
later he saw another espresso bar. This one was even
more crowded. Schultz noticed that the gray-haired
man behind the counter greeted each customer by
name. He and his customers were laughing, talking,
and enjoying the moment. He could tell that the
customers were regulars and that the espresso
bar ‘offered comfort, community, and a sense of
extended family.’ That afternoon, after his trade
show meetings, Schultz noted that
‘I set off again, walking the streets of Milan to
observe more espresso bars . . . As I watched,
I had a revelation: Starbucks had missed the
point—completely missed it. This is so powerful,
I thought. This is the link. What we had to do

was unlock the romance and mystery of coffee,
firsthand, in coffee bars. It was like an epiphany.
It seemed so obvious. Starbucks sold great coffee
beans, but we didn’t serve coffee by the cup. If
we could recreate in America the authentic Italian
coffee bar culture, it might resonate with other
Americans the way it did with me. Starbucks
could be a great experience, and not just a great
retail store. I stayed in Milan about a week.
I continued my walks through the city, getting lost
every day. One morning I took a train ride to
Verona. Its coffee bars were much like Milan’s,
and in one, I mimicked someone and ordered a
caffe latte, my first taste of that drink . . . Of all
the coffee experts I had met, none had ever mentioned this drink. No one in America knows about
this, I thought. I’ve got to take it back with me.’
(Shultz and Yang, 1997: 51).
Most IEs shared how they regularly engaged in
observing behavior, which often triggered new
ideas.
Similarly, Scott Cook (founder and CEO of Intuit)
founded the company based on a simple observation
of his own family at home. He revealed:
‘I came up with the idea for the software by
watching my wife work and hearing her complain.
She’s very good at accounting. She’s got a good
mind for math and is quite organized. So she does
the bills for us. But she was complaining about it.
It was a waste of time and bookkeeping was a
hassle. So it was that observation and then combining that with two other things—an understanding of what personal computers could do well and
not do well—that started Intuit . . . Often the surprises that lead to new business ideas come from
watching other people work and live their normal
life. You see something and ask why do they do
that? Well that doesn’t make sense. I never
expected that.’
Interestingly, Cook had relied on these observational
skills much earlier in his career:
‘One of the concepts that I brought into Intuit
came by observing what Apple was doing. I got
a buddy of mine who worked at Apple to show
me the Apple Lisa before its launch. I was so
struck by the insights from seeing the Apple Lisa.
It wasn’t trying to do financial software at all, but
the concepts behind that user interface. I can

remember leaving the Apple headquarters in
Cupertino and driving to the nearest restaurant so
I could just sit down with a pad of paper and write
out the various insights that I’d observed from
watching the concept of the graphical user interface, the concept of making the items that you
work with on screen look and work just like their
real world counterparts.’
Further, some IEs explained how they saw the
importance of replicating their own observational
skills more broadly within their organizations. Cook
put it simply: ‘Basic observation is the big game
changer in our company. Some paradigm shifts are,
I find, better initiated by watching customers or
watching things happen in the marketplace, as
opposed to talking to other experts. But surprises
[from observation] are typically lost because our
minds try to conform what we see to fit our preexisting beliefs. It’s particularly true in organizations
where sociologically the organization tries to
conform things to fit the organizations view and we
tend to lose those surprises. So one thing that I teach
is when people go out and watch people work, then
come back and ask just one question—What’s
different than you expected?—that often generates
surprising responses,’
Beyond these examples, the interview data consistently revealed that IEs actively observe the world
around them, listening, seeing, etc. In fact, Bezos
(Amazon) revealed that ‘I take pictures of really bad
innovations, of which there are a number’ as part of
his approach to seeing the world in different ways
through observation.
Proposition 2: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs more frequently engage in active observation, primarily of
consumers and end users.
Experimenting
The innovative entrepreneurs in this study frequently
engaged in some form of active experimentation to
generate novel information. Such experimentation
ranged from mental explorations (e.g., Omidyar,
eBay), to physical explorations (e.g., Schultz,
Starbucks), to tinkering with things as children and
adults (e.g., Jobs, Apple; Lazardis, RIM; Bezos,
Amazon). Benioff (founder Salesforce.com) described the experimentation side of this behavior
quite simply with his self-proclaimed identity that
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 9----->326

J. H. Dyer, H. B Gregersen, and C. Christensen

‘I am a tinkerer.’ Others were the same, either with
their hands or minds. They all had in common a
hypothesis testing mindset to approaching their
explorations and experiments.
Some IEs approached experimentation from
an intellectual foundation. Omidyar represents this
category of experimentation well by saying ‘. . .
intellectual exploration is something that I frequently
do and so I think probably my nature is a little bit
more introverted and I have a tendency to sort of be
in my own laboratory. But if within my own laboratory I can be exposed to really different points of
view, different types of thinking either by research,
reading, or by asking the point of view of people I
run into at conferences or meetings or even on the
street, that’s something that I do.’ He actively
explores intellectual terrain in search of new information that he can explore and experiment with
intellectually.
In contrast to Omidyar’s intellectual exploration
and experimentation, a significant proportion of
interviewees were likely to engage in more tangible
experimentation—even as young children. Bezos
(Amazon) admitted that he turned his family garage
into his own little laboratory, and his mother claims
he tried to take his crib apart when he was three
years old. Lazardis (RIM) and others were similar
to Bezos in that they grew up experimenting by
taking things apart. Lazridis described how in his
electronics lab in high school he built his own computer and described how he and his friends spent
additional time ‘writing our own operating systems,
writing our own graphics environments, and building everything from scratch . . . I hung out with
others who liked to build things and explore interesting ideas. And I was also, in a quirky way, very
involved in physics. I was exploring the theory of
relativity with friends of mine when we were in high
school together.’ Jobs (Apple) does the same today
as he attempts to figure out how things work and
how to make them work better. For example, he
obtained one of the first Sony Walkmans to be produced and immediately took it apart to figure out
how it worked and how it could work better. Dell
did the same with his first computer.
Pushing tinkering to a different level, many IEs,
like Wattles (Hollywood Video), actively engaged
themselves and others in experimentation. Wattles
said ‘I do tons of experimenting . . . I just have no
fear of trying things. Just go try them. When you
have 1,800 stores, maybe you’ll ruin a store. That
could be the worst that could happen to you.
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

I wouldn’t want that to happen. But you’re not going
to ruin a company, so we’re gonna try stuff.’
Most IEs were conscious of their own tendency
to experiment frequently, and they were equally
adamant about enlisting others to do the same in
their organizations. Cook (Intuit) explained:
‘The two companies I learned the most from are
Procter & Gamble and Toyota, and both have
experimentation cultures. Toyota enables huge
numbers of experiments done throughout the
organization at all levels. And I think you see in
some young Web businesses, the ability to do lots
of experiments and try a bunch of things as the
business is trying to get things to click. I think our
culture opens us to scientific experimentation, not
just random attempts. To harvesting the learning
and allowing lots of failures. They know that a
bunch of them will fail. But it’s okay as long as
we’re learning, because I think it is an important
theme that separates an innovation culture from a
normal corporate culture. And particularly when
the experiments can be done by young people
without getting approvals. Or if there’s an approval
involved, it’s just one layer; it’s just their boss.’
Other IEs were not only more likely to experiment, but they were also more likely than typical
executives to take a similar experimental approach
organizationally. Bezos (Amazon) explained that ‘if
you’re trying to build a better customer-facing experience, you need to know what consumers think
about your invention and so the thing that we’ve
tried to do as a company, to keep Amazon innovative, is we’re constantly trying to figure out what the
lowest cost of experiments is. Because we want to
be able to do as many experiments as we can every
time. If we can get processes decentralized to do a
lot of experiments without it being very costly, then
you’ll get a lot more innovation. If you can do a
100 experiments a year, you’ll get a tenth as much
innovation as you would get if you could do 1,000
experiments in a year.’
Bezos continued:
‘We’ve got a lot of people here at Amazon with a
combination of stubbornness and flexibility. And
even though those two things seem at odds with
one another, I don’t think they are because I think
there are stubborn visions that are flexible on the
details. And when I see that in somebody, when
they just won’t give up on their vision, they’re
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 10----->Entrepreneur Behaviors
relentless on their vision but they’re very, very
flexible on the details. Flexible of mind. I mean,
they’ll try one approach and if it doesn’t work,
they’ll circle back around and try another.’
Whitman, former CEO of eBay, claimed that experimenting behavior was one of the things that distinguished the innovative entrepreneurs she worked
with. She said that ‘they really love to tinker and
experiment. I’d say that is one of the attributes that
is common to all of these folks.’
In contrast, some executives expressed a reluctance to do too much experimenting because experiments were viewed as costly and inefficient, or
perhaps they were beyond the scope of the company’s business model. One executive said that ‘we
will do experiments as long as they fit within the
current business model. But I don’t want to try new
things that take us away from our business model.’
Proposition 3: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs more
frequently experiment and explore, particularly
doing so with a hypothesis testing mindset.
Idea Networking
Interviews with innovative entrepreneurs revealed
that building and maintaining diverse social networks was another behavioral skill they engaged in
more frequently than typical executives. It’s not that
executives didn’t also network, but executives were
more likely to network to further their careers, to sell
what they or their current company had to offer,
or to build friendships with people who possessed
desired resources. IEs were less likely to use networks primarily for friendships or career progression; rather, they were actively creating networks of
people with diverse ideas and perspectives that they
could tap into for new ideas and insights. Scott Cook
(Intuit) shared that ‘the majority of my ideas come
from networking.’
Putting idea networks into regular practice, Eliot
Jacobsen (Freeport.com) made the observation that
‘one of the things I try to do on a regular basis is
meet and talk to new people to get their perspective
on different issues. I tend to do this during mealtime.
Each week, I try to schedule breakfast, lunch, or
dinner with someone I’ve never met before. I also
frequently meet with people I know who are creative
and who I’ve found are helpful in offering a different
perspective. Networking is important to my success
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

327

in coming up with new business ideas, and mealtime
is for networking.’
Though Omidyar tends to rely on thought
experiments for many of his insights, idea networking also surfaced on his behavioral patterns as key
to information acquisition:
‘Most of my new ideas really come from what I
would call a synthesis of outside inputs. So rather
than saying I want to figure out what to do in
philanthropy. So who should I go talk to? Let me
get a list of philanthropy experts and talk to them.
Instead, what I try to do is just be exposed to some
different styles of thinking. I really look for
insights from unexpected—usually nonexpert—
directions. I value ideas from unusual places; the
cliché would be rather than talking to the CEO I
would want to talk to someone in the mailroom,
something like that. But really looking for people
that have diverse backgrounds, diverse ways of
thinking about things, and getting input from
these different directions just in a very open-ended
way, not in a directed way like, hey I’m trying to
figure some new, innovative idea for philanthropy,
what should I do? Just in a very open-ended way.
And then I think what my brain does is kind of
synthesizes all of that, and at the end of the day
I’ll have some sort of an insight that will pop
up and I can’t tell you where it came from
necessarily.’
For Omidyar and other IEs, idea networks served
a similar purpose in generating a diverse set of
inputs for potential problem solving or opportunity
recognition.
Most innovative entrepreneurs interviewed in this
study had an identifiable network of people with
diverse experiences and perspectives to challenge
the IEs’ viewpoints. These networks typically
crossed industry and geographical boundaries,
as well as generational ones. For example, Ingvar
Kamprad (founder IKEA) regularly met with teenagers, even in his 70s and 80s, to get different perspectives on potential innovation at IKEA. IEs seem
to realize that ideas and ways of viewing the world
are more similar within social groups (e.g., within
the same family, business function, organization,
industry, etc.) than they are across groups. So they
make a conscious effort to bridge a structural hole
to talk to people from different social networks—
essentially building a bridge from their network
into a network of people that differs in background,
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)

J. H. Dyer, H. B Gregersen, and C. Christensen

education, experience, etc. (Burt, 1992; Rodan and
Galunic, 2004). This seems to help them acquire
early access to diverse, often contradictory, information and interpretations, which gives them an advantage in seeing and developing novel ideas.
Proposition 4: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs spend
more time talking with a network of individuals
who are diverse in both background and
perspective.
Associational thinking/pattern recognition
We also found that diverse new information and
ideas—which come through questioning, experimenting, observing, and networking behaviors—
were often the catalyst for associational thinking/
pattern recognition.2 The more new diverse knowledge acquired through these four discovery behaviors, the more naturally and consistently associational
thinking occurs as the brain attempts to understand,
recategorize, and store new knowledge.
As previously described in the theory section,
associational thinking is a cognitive skill that helps
one make connections across seemingly unrelated
questions, problems, disciplines, fields, or ideas.
Mike Lazaridis (RIM) was successful at connecting
computer technology with wireless handheld devices
to create the Blackberry. He recognized the importance of cross disciplinary thinking and described
his first experience with it.
‘When I was in high school, we had an advanced
honors program and we had a shop program. And
there was this great divide between the two departments, and I was in both. And I became, inadvertently, the ambassador between the two disciplines,
and saw how the mathematics we were learning
in shop was actually more advanced than some of
the mathematics we were learning in advanced

2

We prefer the term associational thinking (Howard-Jones and
Murray, 2003; Mednick, 1962; Mednick, Mednick, and Jung,
1964; Mendelsohn and Griswold; 1964; Milgram and Rabkin,
1980) to pattern recognition because the latter term seems to
suggest that there is an identifiable pattern IEs recognize. As
they described how they discovered or recognized ideas for
innovative new ventures, it seemed to us that while they connected disparate ideas together, they often did not necessarily
recognize a pattern, or even recognize that it would be a viable
business opportunity. They often discovered that things fit
together through trial and error and adaptation.

math because we’re using trigonometry, we’re
using imaginary numbers, we’re using algebra,
and even calculus in very real, tangible ways.
So I was then tasked with bridging the gap and
showing how math is used in electronics and how
electronics is used in math.’
Lazaridis noted that [a teacher] alerted him to the
link between computers and wireless by telling him
‘. . . don’t get too distracted with computer technology because the person that puts wireless and computers together is really coming up with something
special.’
Similarly, Pierre Omidyar (eBay) noted that connecting ideas was an important skill, and he gave a
recent example of associational thinking:
‘I recently spoke with some consultants about the
food distribution problem of how to quickly get
produce from the farm to consumers before it
spoils. The first question I asked, which may turn
out to be an incredibly stupid question but I was
happy to ask it was, ‘What about the Post Office?
Doesn’t the Post Office go to everybody’s house
six times a week? Why don’t we just mail the head
of lettuce?’ You know, it’s probably an incredibly
stupid idea and there are probably a dozen reasons
why it won’t work, but it’s an example of how I
put two things together that haven’t been put
together before. The Post Office is an organization that visits every household six times a week!
Do you know any other organization that does
that? So using those assets in novel ways might
be interesting.’
Steve Jobs (founder and CEO Apple) appears to be
strong at associational thinking and recognizes its
importance to creativity. For example, he connected
calligraphy to computers, based on his college
experience:
‘Reed College at that time offered perhaps the
best calligraphy instruction in the country.
Throughout the campus every poster, every label
on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t
have to take the normal classes, I decided to take
a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about
varying the amount of space between different
letter combinations, about what makes great
typography great. It was beautiful, historical,
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 12----->Entrepreneur Behaviors
artistically subtle in a way that science can’t
capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this
had even a hope of any practical application in my
life. But 10 years later, when we were designing
the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to
me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was
the first computer with beautiful typography. If I
had never dropped in on that single course in
college, the Mac would have never had multiple
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And
since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely
that no personal computer would have them.’
(Stanford University, 2005)
Jobs did the same by looking at Cuisinart food processors to get insights into the plastic case properties
that might work for the first Mac, and he later examined Mercedes Benz cars in the corporate parking
lot to gain perspective on a different product design
challenge that was ultimately resolved by associating car parts with computer parts.
One of the innovative entrepreneurs tried to
explain the process based on his experience.
Zennstrom (founder of Skype) said: ‘You have to
think laterally. You know, seeing and combining
certain things going on at the same time and understanding how seemingly unrelated things could have
something to do with each other. You need the
ability to grasp different things going on at the same
time and then to bring them together. For example,
I can look at the bigger picture and also have a
very good feel for the details. So I can go between
high-level things to really, really small details. The
movement often makes for new associations.’
Proposition 5: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs more frequently engage in associational thinking (pattern
recognition) which is triggered by their behavioral patterns of frequently questioning, observing, experimenting, and idea networking.
Desire to change the status quo: less susceptible
to the status quo bias
Finally, the innovative entrepreneurs in our study
more frequently expressed a desire to change the
world or do something that has never been done
before As previously mentioned, Meg Whitman,
former CEO of eBay, claimed that the IEs she has
worked with ‘get a kick out of screwing up the status
quo. . . . So they spend a tremendous amount of time
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

329

thinking about how to change the world.’ This
observation was supported by Skype cofounder
Niklas Zennstrom, who remarked that ‘I thrive on
changing the status quo; that’s what motivates me.
I definitely want to change the world. And I think
this is very important where sometimes people think
of disruptive and destructive being the same thing.
But to me, this is about making the world a better
place.’ In similar fashion, Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com)
said that one of his goals in starting Amazon.com
was to ‘make history,’ while Steve Jobs (Apple)
claimed that ‘I want to put a ding in the universe.’
An emergent theme from the interviews was that
these entrepreneurs were not satisfied to simply start
financially successful new businesses. Offering
something new to the market was an important part
of the allure of starting a new business. As Jeff
Jones, founder of Campus Pipeline and NxLight
observed, ‘I’ve had numerous opportunities to start
new businesses, but haven’t followed up on some of
them because they didn’t offer something new to the
market. I want to do something new, not offer something that is already out there.’ The desire to change
the world was far less frequently mentioned by executives as a motivator for their actions and behaviors.
They more frequently expressed the sentiment that
they were highly motivated to see their business
succeed financially.
Given the frequency with which innovative entrepreneurs indicated a desire to change the world relative to executives, we believe that they are less
susceptible to a cognitive bias referred to as the
status quo bias. The status quo bias has been defined
as the tendency of individuals to prefer an existing
state of affairs—to prefer what they have chosen
before (the current state) or even what someone else
has chosen for them. A variety of prior experimental
and field studies offer evidence that most individuals
are subject to the status quo bias (Porter and
McIntyre, 1984; Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988;
Roca et al., 2005; Burmeister and Schade, 2006).
The innovative entrepreneurs in our study seemed
to engage in the information-seeking behaviors
described above with a cognitive bias against the
status quo. They seemed to be actively engaged in
information search with the purpose of changing the
current state of affairs. As Xango founder Aaron
Garrity put it, ‘If you were to characterize me as an
individual, I would say I am a revolutionary. My law
is different . . . you tell me the way it is and I’m
going to say to heck with you all, I’m going to do it
this way.’ While prior research has shown that
Strat. Entrepreneurship J., 2: 317–338 (2008)
DOI: 10.1002/sej

<-----Page 13----->330

J. H. Dyer, H. B Gregersen, and C. Christensen

entrepreneurs are prone to cognitive biases—notably
the overconfidence and representativeness biases
(Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Parlich and Bagby,
1995)—little work has been done to examine the
status quo bias among (innovative) entrepreneurs.
One unpublished study found that a sample of
German entrepreneurs was less prone to the status
quo than a sample of German bankers, but no different than a sample of college students (Burmeister
and Schade, 2006). Another study somewhat related
to challenging the status quo bias found that innovative Canadian law firm founders were more likely to
challenge the ethicality of prevailing legal practices
than imitative firm founders (Cliff et al., 2006). We
believe that additional research in this area would
demonstrate that innovative entrepreneurs are less
susceptible to the status quo bias.
Proposition 6: Compared to managers in large
organizations, innovative entrepreneurs are less
susceptible to the status quo bias and more likely
to be motivated to change the world.

QUANTITATIVE STUDY: COMPARING
BEHAVIORS OF INNOVATIVE
ENTREPRENEURS AND EXECUTIVES
Our inductive study allowed us to develop some
theoretical propositions regarding the relationship
between IE behaviors and opportunity recognition.
We then developed measures of those behaviors to
shed additional light through a large sample quantitative study about whether IEs are more prone to the
behaviors identified in the inductive study.

original (novel, unique) idea?’ Seventy-two percent
of these innovative business ventures were identified
as financially successful (n = 99), meaning they
achieved sales of greater than $1 million and a return
on invested capital of greater than 10 percent. Thus,
28 percent of the innovative business ventures started
were not successful based on our study criteria. This
suggests that we were not sampling on successful
innovative business ventures only.

Measures
During our inductive study, we developed survey
measures we wanted to test in a large sample study
of innovative entrepreneurs and managers in large
organizations. Based on the four behavioral patterns
that emerged from the interviews, we developed a
set of survey items to operationalize the constructs
(e.g., behavioral patterns) that seemed to distinguish
the innovative entrepreneurs from executives (see
Appendix). The survey items attempted to measure
specific behavioral patterns: questioning (six items),
observing (four items), experimenting (five items),
and idea networking (four items). Response options
ranged from 1 or strongly disagree to 7 or strongly
agree. We also used four social desirability survey
items to identify and exclude (if necessary) respondents who were prone to provide extreme levels of
socially desirable responses on the survey. Analysis
indicated that such socially desirable responses did
not appear problematic or systematic in this
sample.

Sample

Methods

During a two-year period from 2007–08, we invited
512 managers and executives to take our survey.
These respondents were participating in executive
programs and executive MBA programs at three
business schools—one in the eastern United States,
one in the western United States, and one in Europe.
After eliminating surveys with incomplete data, we
had 382 respondents. Among the 382 respondents,
72 individuals had started a total of 137 innovative
business ventures based upon positive responses to
‘How many new businesses (e.g., not franchises or
a business where identical or close product substitutes were already on the market) have you started
or cofounded as an entrepreneur based on your own,

Initially, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to uncover the underlying factor structure
of the 19 items attempting to measure innovative
behaviors. As shown in Table 2, the rotated factor
matrix produced a four-factor solution. There
was only one potentially problematic cross-loading
across factors in this exploratory analysis (indicated
by a cross-loading greater than 0.40). The item
‘I often ask questions that challenge the status quo’
exhibited a loading of 0.52 on the main factor, as
well as 0.42 on the experimenting factor. As this
cross-loading did not appear seriously problematic,
the item was retained in the questioning scale. Table
2 also indicates that the alpha reliabilities for these

scales ranged from 0.74–0.78 (each being above the
0.70 criterion suggested by Hair et al., 1988).
We also ran a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
to test the factor structure of the 19 items representing the innovative entrepreneur behaviors uncovered
in the qualitative study. The CFA for each of the

0.99), followed by questioning (GFI = 0.95), experimenting (GFI = 0.94), and idea networking (GFI =
0.90). However, the CFA of our four-factor model
did not show particularly good fit, with GFI = 0.63,
a chi-square of 1864, RMSEA = 0.14, and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.16. It
seems plausible that common variance among many
of the items that comprised each of the innovative
behavior factors compromised the fit of the fourfactor model (see Table 3, which shows significant
correlations between several of the innovative
behavior factors). As a result, we dropped the items
related to experimenting and idea networking and
ran the CFA with the remaining 10 items, representing questioning and observing. The CFA for the
two-factor model had a GFI = 0.94, a chi-square of
1292.8, RMSEA = 0.08, and Standardized Root
Mean Residual (SRMR) = 0.06, suggesting that the
10 items were strong measures of questioning and
observing. However, to maintain consistency with
the innovative entrepreneur behaviors identified in
the qualitative study and the results of the exploratory factor analysis (see Table 2), we adopted the
four-factor model in the subsequent analysis of the
potential relationships between these behaviors and
starting an innovative new business.
Results
Table 3 provides means, standard deviations, and
correlations for all independent and dependent variables. As seen from the correlation matrix, the four
behavioral patterns we measured were significantly
correlated with starting an innovative new business.
The behavioral patterns were also significantly correlated with each other—with correlations typically
greater than 0.50—suggesting that an individual

who engages in one of the behaviors is more likely
to engage in some level of the other behaviors.
To test the relationships between innovative
behaviors and starting innovative ventures, we concluded that negative binomial regressions were most
appropriate for our data. The dependent variable in
this quantitative study measured the number of innovative new businesses started. As this data was an
integer count without normal distributions and with
restricted ranges (Cohen et al., 2003), ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression would yield inefficient and
biased estimates. Consequently, negative binomial
regressions were used to test the predicted relationships more accurately (Ramaswamy, Anderson,
and DeSarbo, 1994).
The negative binomial regression analysis results
shown in column 1 of Table 4 indicate that, controlling for age and education, observing and experimenting have significant positive relationships with
innovative new venture creation. Questioning and
idea networking did not have significant relationships with venture creation when included in the
model with observing and experimenting. In fact,
while idea networking had a significant positive
relationship with new venture creation as shown in
the correlation matrix, the relationship was negative
in the negative binomial regression, suggesting that
the model is prone to some degree of multicollinearity among the independent variables. The fact that
there were strong correlations among the innovative
behaviors, however, led us to examine the interaction of questioning with each of the other independent variables. We chose to interact questioning with
the other innovative behaviors for a theoretical
reason. When reconsidering the results of the inductive study, we realized that questioning was virtually
always described as being done at the same time the
IE was engaged in observing, experimenting, or idea
networking behaviors. The results shown in columns
2–4 in Table 4 indicate that questioning is a significant predictor of innovative new venture formation
when interacted with observing, experimenting, and
idea networking behaviors. Thus, questioning on its
own does not appear to have a direct effect on opportunity recognition and innovative new venture creation, but when combined with one of the other three
innovative behaviors, it is a solid predictor of new
venture creation. Each of the overall models shown
in columns 1–4 are solid, as suggested by a
Pearson’s chi-square, which ranges from 348–381,
and a log likelihood of -738–741 (the model in
column 4 appears to be the best fit model).

Summary
The results from our quantitative study provide preliminary support for the assertion that innovative
entrepreneurs are more likely than managers to
engage in questioning, observing, experimenting,
and idea networking behaviors. The regression
results indicate that observing and experimenting
were the most robust predictors of new venture creation, whereas questioning and networking were
significant predictors of new venture creation when
interacted with each other or the other discovery
behaviors. Questioning is only a consistent predictor
of new venture creation when interacted with each
of the other behaviors separately. These results
suggest that an individual who simply asks questions
without actively observing, experimenting, or
networking is unlikely to discover or act upon ideas
for new venture creation.

TOWARD A THEORY OF
ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIORS
AND OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION
The theory that emerged from our inductive and
quantitative studies regarding behavioral differences
of innovative entrepreneurs (IEs) compared to managers in large organizations is summarized in Figure
1. Study results suggest that IEs are more likely to
recognize opportunities for new businesses because
they are more likely to engage in observing and
experimenting behaviors, and questioning when
combined with any one of the other three innovative
behaviors (observing, experimenting, and idea networking). These are all information-seeking behaviors that appear to give IEs superior access to
information—a factor that is believed to be central
to opportunity recognition.
These behaviors appeared to be the catalysts to
cognitive processes of associational thinking that
allowed the innovative entrepreneur to generate an
innovative business idea. Prior research suggests
that innovative breakthroughs often happen at the
intersection of disciplines and fields (Johansson,
2006; Hargadon and Sutton, 1997; Rodan and
Galunic, 2004). Put simply, innovative thinkers have
managed to connect fields, problems, or ideas that
we thought were unrelated. We propose that the
behavioral patterns noted above are what trigger the
intersections that are the catalysts for innovative
ideas. The more diverse knowledge acquired through

the information-gathering behaviors we’ve described,
the more naturally and consistently associational
thinking occurs as the brain attempts to understand,
categorize, and store new knowledge.
To illustrate, the innovative entrepreneurs we
studied rarely invented something entirely new—
they simply combined existing ideas and technologies in new ways, which allowed them to offer
something new to the market. Individuals who more
frequently observe, experiment, and network while
questioning the status quo build larger and richer
stocks of building block ideas in their heads, thereby
triggering associational thinking and increasing the
probability of combining the newly acquired knowledge to generate an innovative idea. This process is
akin to someone building more unique structures
from Lego blocks as a result of having access to a
larger stock of diverse Lego blocks. The more you
add different kinds of Legos to your total stock of
Legos, the more varied and innovative structures
you can build. Innovative structures spring from the
innovative combination of a wide variety of existing
Legos. And acquiring new and different Legos triggers ideas for new structures as they are considered
with one’s existing stock of Legos. In a similar
fashion, the more you add knowledge or ideas from
varied knowledge domains (through observing,
experimenting, networking) to your total stock of
ideas, the greater the variety of ideas you can
produce. Conceptually, as the number of building
block ideas in one’s head grows linearly (e.g., by N),
the number of potential ways to combine those ideas
to create something new grows even faster, or geometrically (by N(N-1)/2) (see Figure 2). Thus, the
behaviors of questioning, observing, experimenting,
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

and idea networking are tied to associational thinking/pattern recognition because they bring in new
building block ideas that are often the catalyst for
creating new associations among ideas, fields, and
technologies.
We acknowledge that cognitive processes are at
work within IEs and that some had superior natural
cognitive ability to make connections across fields
and technologies. There are undoubtedly differences
in the cognitive ability of individuals to engage in
associational thinking. We have no way to measure
these differences. However, even if we assume that
two individuals have the same natural cognitive
ability to engage in associational thinking, we would
predict differences in novel idea generation if one
individual engages in more of the informationgathering behaviors we have described, thereby
triggering more novel associations. As Steve Jobs
observed regarding the link between broad experience and creativity:
‘Creativity is connecting things. When you ask
creative people how they did something, they feel
a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they
just saw something. It seemed obvious to them
after a while. That’s because they were able to
connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize
new things. And the reason they were able to do
that was that they’ve had more experiences or
they have thought more about their experiences
than other people’ (Wolf, 1996: 6).
Finally, the IEs seem to engage in the informationgathering behaviors because they are actively
looking for opportunities to change the status quo.
This desire to change the status quo was an

Note: As the number of diverse ideas (knowledge elements) in a person’s head increases arithmetically, the number

important motivator for IEs and coincides with the
active search for opportunities that has been identified in the entrepreneurship literature.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between innovative entrepreneurs and executives who had never started an innovative venture.
We conducted a grounded theory study of innovative
entrepreneurs to examine behavioral and cognitive
patterns that appeared to contribute to their ability
to recognize opportunities and generate innovative
business ideas. We posit that innovative entrepreneurs differ from executives on four behavioral patterns: (1) questioning, particularly asking questions
that challenge the status quo; (2) observing, or the
extent to which they spend time intensely observing
the world around them in a search for new ideas;
(3) experimenting, or the frequency with which they
experiment and explore the world with a hypothesistesting mindset; and (4) idea networking, or the
extent to which they find and test ideas with a network
of individuals who are diverse in both background
and perspective. We developed operational measures
of each of these behaviors and found that observing
and experimenting behaviors were robust predictors
of innovative new venture creation in a large sample
Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society

of innovative entrepreneurs and executives. We
found that questioning and idea networking were
significant when interacted with each other or the
other discovery behaviors. These findings suggest
that one’s ability to generate novel ideas for innovative businesses is a function of one’s behaviors,
which trigger cognitive processes that spawn ideas
for novel business ventures.
Our study suggests that innovative entrepreneurship is indeed an active endeavor. Innovative entrepreneurs are behaviorally active—asking questions,
observing, experimenting, and networking with
diverse people. In his seminal work on risk and
uncertainty, Knight saw entrepreneurs as a class of
individuals who had the disposition to act in spite of
the uncertain context in which they operated (Knight,
1921: 269). Our research lends support to this assertion and provides insights into what types of actions
are likely to be catalysts for innovative business
ideas. Of course, once the idea is generated, the
entrepreneur must then quickly implement the idea
if it is to be perceived as new in the marketplace.3
A limitation of this study was that we did not have
a sample of noninnovative entrepreneurs (e.g., those

Execution of novel business ideas is beyond the scope of this
article, but it is important to recognize that effective execution
is also critical to the success of an innovative venture.

who had started franchises) in our sample to compare
with the innovative entrepreneurs. Also, we relied
exclusively on individuals to report on the extent to
which they behaved in particular ways. Future
research might explicitly compare a sample of noninnovative entrepreneurs with innovative entrepreneurs on the behaviors we identified. We also
recommend that future research of this type gather
input on the behaviors of entrepreneurs from others
who are well acquainted with the entrepreneurs’
behaviors. Finally, we were not able to measure the
degree or extent to which individuals engage in associational thinking, which limits our ability to test
whether or not the behaviors we identify are correlated with associational thinking. Future research
that could measure associational thinking and interact this measure with the discovery behaviors we
identify could test the proposition that the discovery
behaviors trigger assocational thinking, as well as
the proposition that the interaction of discovery
behaviors and associational thinking increase the
probability of innovative new venture creation.
