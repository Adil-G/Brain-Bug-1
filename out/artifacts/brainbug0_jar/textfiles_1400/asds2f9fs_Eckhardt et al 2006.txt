U

sing a random sample of 221 new Swedish ventures initiated in 1998, we examine why some new ventures
are more likely than others to successfully be awarded capital from external sources. We examine venture
financing as a staged selection process in which two sequential selection events systematically winnow the population of ventures and influence which ventures receive financing. For a venture to receive external financing
its founders must Erst select it as a candidate for external funding, and then a financier must fund it. We find
evidence that founders select ventures as candidates for external finance based on their perceptions of market
competition, market growth, and employment growth, while financiers base funding decisions on objective verifiable indicators of venture development, such as the completion of organizing activities, marketing activities,
and the level of sales of the venture. Our findings have implications for venture financing and evolutionary
theories of social processes.

Introduction

the population of new ventures, those that they
perceive as having performance prospects that justify the investment of time in resources necessary
to raise funds from external sources (Bhide 1992).
In the second stage, financiers choose to provide
capital to the subset of the firms for which firm
founders seek financing for which there is objective evidence of performance. The sequential nature
of this process—financiers do not finance ventures
that do not seek external financing—combined with
the different selection criteria of financiers and firm
founders, creates a two-stage process of cumulative
selection (Langolis and Everett 1994). To examine this
argument, we analyze a uiuque data set capturing
the life histories of 221 new ventures—which we
define as efforts by one or more individuals holding at least fractional ownership to create new independent organizations to pursue for-profit business
opporturuties—initiated in Sweden during the Hrst
nine months of 1998.
This paper makes several contributions. First, this
study indicates that the financing of new ventures
follows an evolutionary selection process. Consistent
with Mohr (1982), we find that the specific process

The process of founding a new venture requires
entrepreneurs to engage in activities such as hiring
employees, obtaining inputs, and developing products. Because these activities are costly, and often
must take place before the new venture generates
revenue from the sale of new products or services,
founders of many firms seek financing from outside sources for their new ventures (Gompers and
Lerner 1999). Consequently, external financing is an
important part of the new venhire creation process
(Venkataraman 1997, Shane and Venkataraman 2000),
and is widely examined in the literature (MacMillan
and Narasimha 1987, Gompers 1994, Sapienza and
Gupta 1994, Gompers 1995, Gompers and Lerner
1999,
Sorenson and Stuart 2001, Shane and Cable
2002).
Although much prior research has explored new
venture finance (Sahlman 1990, Fried and Hisrich
1994, Gompers and Lerner 1999, Uzzi and Gillespie
1999), none of this literature has examined the fundamentally dynamic nature of the process. New venture
finance follows a pattern of multistage selection over
time. In the first stage, firm founders select, from
220

under which selection occurs, as well as the criteria that appear to drive selection at each stage, are
both important in explaining why some ventures in
the population are more likely to receive financing
from external sources than others. Second, we empirically examine the overlooked yet important role of
founders in the process of new venture finance. By
taking into consideration the two-stage process of
cumulative selection, we reduce the bias that comes
from the problematic assumption, inherent in static
cross-sectional and single-stage longitudinal studies,
that founders' selection criteria do not influence the
characteristics of the sample of ventures that investors
have the opportunity to finance (Bates 1990). Specifically, we show how failure to appropriately address
the potential effects of selection at each stage fails to
capture key relationships and leads to biased findings (Klepper et al. 1983, Hogan and Kitagawa 1985,
Yamaguchi 1991). Third, our study provides evidence
about new venture finance that can be generalized
to the t3^ical new venture. Most studies of venture finance have focused on financing of ventures
by professional venture capital firms. However, most
fledgling ventures are financed from sources other
than venture capital (Bates 1990, Hustedde and Pulver
1992). In contrast to studies that have focused exclusively on venture capital financing, ventures in our
sample seek funds from friends, family, banks, business angels, and government agencies, as well as from
venture capitalists.
Fourth, our study overcomes the problems of selection bias that plague many studies of new venture
finance. Standard approaches to venture finance typically examine samples constructed from lists of new
firms. These approaches suffer from selection bias
because those ventures that were abandoned before
the lists were created must be excluded from analysis (Katz and Gartner 1988, Gompers 1995), and
financing events may have occurred prior to a firm
being included on the published list. We start with a
random sample that is representative of the population of new Swedish ventures, and our data includes
information collected over time about both the search
for, and receipt of, external financing, allowing us to
avoid the problem of left-censored observations.
We define a new venture as an effort by a person
or persons to create a new organization that engages
in commercial activity. We define a new venture this
way, rather than as a new legal entity, because firm
financing events can occur well before new legal organizations are established (Bantel 1998, Zahra et al.
2000). Our data support this approach, as we find that
many of the ventures in our sample seek and receive
financing from external sources before they became
new legal organizations.

221
We define the first financing event as the first time
the venture is awarded capital from external sources,
where external sources include any provider of capital who was not a member of the founding team.
Hence, we examine the typical initial financing event
for the t3^ical venture. Consistent with evidence on
the sources of financing for most ventures, venture
capital is a source of financing for relatively few of
the ventures in our sample.
We examine two stages of the financing process.
Stage 1 is defined as the decision of founders to seek
financing for external capital. Stage 2 is defined as
the decision of investors to provide capital to those
ventures that sought external financing. As our interest is in studying factors that influence the receipt of
capital from external sources for the^'rsf time, we do
not examine financing events that follow the receipt
of first financing.

Theory Development
New Venture Finance as a Multistage
Selection Process
We argue that the most accurate theoretical lens
for viewing the new venture financing process is
that of a multistage selection process. For a venture to receive financing from external sources, an
entrepreneur must decide to seek financing from outside sources and then an investor must fimd it. Patterns exist among entrepreneurs in how they select
ventures to become candidates for external capital,
and patterns exist among investors in how they select
ventures to finance. Consequently, the aggregated
actions of entrepreneurs and investors at each stage
act as population level selection screens (Meyer 1994).
Multistage selection models assume four characteristics that shape the attributes of any population. First,
variation exists in any population of entities (Nelson
and Winter 1982). Second, those entities do not all
have an equal likelihood of selection (Hannan and
Freeman 1977). Third, selection is staged; and each
selection screen is contingent on the outcome of prior
selection screens (Aldrich 1999). Fourth, the selection
criteria can vary across stages of selection (Campbell
1969).
The new venture finance process possesses all four
of these characteristics (Aldrich 1999). First, the population of new ventures for which founders decide
whether to seek external financing exhibits significant variation in the nature of the opportunities pursued, the human capital of the founders, and the
approach that the founders plan to take to organizing a firm. Second, this variation means that not all
new ventures are equally fit for external financing.
Selection criteria exist that make some ventures more

222

likely to be selected as candidates for external financing, as well as render some selected candidates more
likely to receive such external financing. For example, prior research has shown that several attributes
influence the likelihood of obtaining venture finance.
Venture age is associated with obtaining external capital (MacMillan et al. 1985, Churchill and Lewis 1986,
Hall and Hofer 1993), as are the founders' work experience, and industry-specific experience (Hustedde
and Pulver 1992, Lerner 1994, Bhide 2000). Third,
the selection process is cumulative, resulting in path
dependencies. The population on which selection
occurs at later stages is contingent on selection outcomes at prior stages. As the process evolves, prior
selection events winnow down the population that
enters each subsequent stage. In the specific case we
examine, this means that only those ventures that firm
founders select as candidates for external financing
are evaluated by financiers. Finally, the characteristics necessary for selection at one stage may be quite
different from the characteristics necessary for survival at subsequent selection events (Campbell 1969).
In the case of venture finance, differences in cognitive approach (Busenitz and Barney 1997, Sarasvathy
et al. 1998), information, or incentives may render the
selection criteria utilized by founders and investors to
be different.
In Figure 1 we highlight the selection problem in
the multistaged venture finance process. In this rudimentary example, ventures are identified as having
two characteristics: (1) the founder's perception of the
growth of the market in which the venture operates
(denoted A), and (2) the level of sales of the venture
(denoted B), where capital letters refer to larger values and lower-case letters refer to smaller values. Column 1 represents the pool of all ventures that exist
at a specific point in time. In the first stage, from this
initial pool founders select those ventures in markets
they perceive as growing (A) as candidates for external financing, creating the pool of investment candidates depicted in Column 2. In the second stage,
financiers attempt to provide financing oivly to those
ventures that have higher sales (B). As shown in Figure 1, founder selection may constrain the choices of

financiers, to the extent that ventures exist in Column 1 that exhibit objective performance attributes,
such as having higher sales, that never become candidates for external financing.
The nature of selection at the two stages fosters
empirical complexities that must be addressed to
appropriately measure the factors that drive selection,
even if the empirical interest is only on the second
stage (Berk 1983). For instance, failure to appropriately model the two stages would provide no explanation as to why a venture with growing sales but
that is in a market that the founders do not perceive
as growing very rapidly (venture "aB" in our example), fails to receive external financing even though it
met financiers' selection criteria.^
Selection Criteria at the Two Stages
Stage 1 Selection: Founders' Selection Criteria.
New ventures vary significantly on many dimensions, including expected value, risk, and resource
requirements (Shane 2000). Because obtaining external financing is costly (Bruno and Tyebjee 1985,
Bhide 1992), firm foimders will seek such financing
if they believe that the value of the venture justifies incurring the costs that external finance entails.
Thus, founders assess the potential of their new ventures to determine whether or not to seek external capital.^ They select new ventures as candidates
for financing from among the pool of all new ventures on the basis of their perceptions of dimensions
such as market growth, industry competitiveness, and
price competitiveness (Highfield and Srruley 1987,
Acs and Audretsch 1989, Romanelli 1989, Shankar
et al. 1999). Specifically, founders are more likely to
select as candidates for financing those ventures that
they perceive to have higher market growth, and less
' It is important to note that even in cases where founders and
investors select ventures through the financing process in the same
manner, founder selection must be appropriately addressed in
statistical models that examine the relationship between venture
attributes and investor selection because founder selection is variance reducing (Klepper et al. 1983). For example, if only those ventures high in sales became candidates for external investment, it
would not be possible to examine the effect of venture sales on the
likelihood of receiving capital from financiers because of a lack of
variance in sales in the pool of candidates for external capital.
^ Entrepreneurs in the process of pursuing opportunities have been
found to be overoptimistic, particularly about their own ventures
(de Meza and Southey 1996, Busenitz and Barney 1997, Cooper
et al. 1988). This overoptimism can lead entrepreneurs to view a
particular venture as promising if their optimism leads them to
believe that a given industry is more attractive than it really is.
We argue that what motivates entrepreneurs is their perception of
industry conditions, which may or may not reflect actual industry
conditions. As a result, those firm foimders who perceive that they
have identified high value opportunities will be more likely to seek
external financing relative to other entrepreneurs.

<-----Page 3----->Focused Issue: Multistage Selection and the Financing of New Ventures

industry and price competition because they perceive
ventures with these characteristics to be more valuable and more likely to justify costly investments in
time and resources necessary to secure fxmding. This
argument leads to the first
^
HYPOTHESIS 1. The likelihood that a firm founder will
seek external funds for a venture increases with the
founder's positive assessment of the venture.

Stage 2 Selection: Investors' Selection Criteria.
While firm foimders seek financing largely as a result
of their own perception of the prospects for their ventures, financiers do not select ventures on the basis of
the founders' perceptions, but instead seek observable
sources of information about the performance of the
new ventures. External sources of information help
to overcome problems that may arise due to asymmetry of information and interests between investors
and entrepreneurs. For example, firm foimders may
possess private information regarding the feasibility
of the business opportunity that they are pursuing,
as well as private iriformation on their own capabilities, knowledge, and the effort they are likely to put
forth to exploit a business opportunity, and they may
withhold this information from financiers (Levin et al.
1987, Amit et al. 1990, Gompers 1995). Moreover, firm
founders exhibit biases in decision making, such as
representativeness, the propensity to draw generalized inferences from small unrepresentative samples
(Tversky and Kahneman 1974), and overoptimism
(de Meza and Southey 1996). These biases may lead
entrepreneurs to make decisions that are not appropriate for the success of the new venture and therefore
inappropriate as the basis of a financier's decision.
Among the major sources of information that
financiers seek is information from the market about
the venture's ability to meet a market need. Because
no venture can earn revenues urJess it has a good
or service to offer customers, evidence that ventures have made contact with potential customers
via informal or formal marketing activities provides
investors with positive information about the potential of the new venture. Another key measure of
market acceptance is the extent to which the venture has successfully sold goods or services to customers because sales demonstrate that customers are
willing to pay for the product or service (Sahlman
1990). The completion of key orgaruzing activities,
such as the forming of a legal entity and applying for
necessary permits and intellectual property protection, also provides investors with iriormation about
hypothesize that founders are more likely to seek external
financing when their assessments of the ventures are more positive.
Note that this hypothesis does not require any founders to pursue
ventures that they assess negatively, as founders can vary in the
extent that they assess their ventures positively.

223

new venture prospects because organizing activities
indicates that the venture is successfully developing
into an actual business entity. Specifically, investors
are more likely to provide financing to those ventures that have engaged in marketing activities, have
undertaken more organizing activities, have engaged
in more product development activity, and have generated more sales. This argument leads to the second
hypothesis:
HYPOTHESIS 2. The likelihood that a firm founder will
receive external funds for a venture, conditional on seeking it, increases with objective measures of the venture's
performance.

Methodology
Sample and Procedure
Obtaining a representative sample of new ventures
is a difficult process because no effective sampling
frame exists. Prior research has commonly defined a
business start-up as an entity that has achieved particular milestones, such as forming a legal organization or initiating production (Carroll and Hannan
2000). However, such an approach introduces selection bias in explaining new venture finance, because
ventures may receive capital prior to the formation of
a legal entity (Sahlman 1990), and because organizing activities undertaken by entrepreneurs prior to the
formation of a legal entity may influence the financing process (Aldrich 1999).
Because the population of newly founded ventures
is impossible to identify directly, we began with a
random sample of the working-age population to
identify people in the process of starting a new business. We contacted by telephone during the first nine
months of 1998, 35,971 adults between the ages of
18 and 70 years old, who were living in Sweden. Of
those contacted, 30,427 (84.6%) agreed to participate
in the survey. We did not find any significant difference in age, sex, and geographic location of contacts
between those that agreed to participate and those
that declined to participate.
We then sought to identify those individuals who
had started a new business during that nine-month
period. To do this we engaged in a four step process. First, we asked the respondents if and when they
had started a new venture, having defined the start
of a new venture as the time when the foimder(s)
irutiated efforts to create the new business (rather
than when they first thought about it). Second, we
asked if the respondents possessed a fractional or full
ownership position in a venture on which they had
started to work, alone or with others, during the first
rune months of 1998. Third, we screened out those
who indicated that the venture was undertaken on

<-----Page 4----->224

behalf of their current employer or an existing firm.
Finally, we asked respondents who indicated that they
met the criteria for more than one business to describe
the venture that they had founded most recently. Of
the individuals contacted, 221 had established a new
venture that met our criteria.'* Thus, our study of venture finance is based on a random sample of Swedish
new ventures that were initiated between January and
September 1998. We use the founders of these ventures as informants about the ventures and treat the
venture as the entity that we track over time.
We contacted the respondents every six months
after our initial contact for 30 months or until the
venture was abandoned.^ Ventures that dropped out
of the sample due to abandonment or nonparticipation were treated as censored from the time of last
contact. Response rates for each subsequent wave
of data collection ranged from 90.5% to 98.5%. We
tested for statistical difference between those ventures
that were dropped as a result of nonresponse and
those that continued to respond throughout the entire
30 months. The only statistical difference detected
between the two groups was that founders of ventures that prematurely ceased to participate expected
less competition than ventures that participated for
the entire period of study.
Ventures in our sample included new farms, homebased businesses, independent consulting firms, manufacturing firms, restaurants, high-tech firms, and
cleaning companies. Founders pursued a variety of
opportunities. Just under half (46.6%) pursued lowtech service opportunities, 87 (39%) pursued hightech service opportunities such as software design.
* We dropped two cases of respondents under the age of 18 from
the analysis to ensure that the sample for this study represents only
adults. The inclusion or exclusion of respondents under the age of
18 has no qualitative effect on our results.
' Data for each venture is based on the response of one individual. In the study of large organizations, construct validity is commonly achieved by collecting information from several respondents
due to concerns that one individual may not be fully aware of
the characteristics of the organization. Conversely, in small ventures such as those studied in this sample, in most cases such an
approach is impractical and redundant for several reasons. First,
in many ventures no individual other than the respondent was
intimately involved in the start-up activities of the orgaruzation or
possessed irvformation necessary to describe the start-up process.
Second, in most cases respondents are providing information on a
small group of people. For the ventures in the sample, the distribution of start-up team size is 44% (1 founder), 33% (2 founders), 10%
(3 founders), 6% (four founders), and 5% (five founders). (Numbers do not sum to 100% due to roimding.) Therefore, in the most
extreme case in our sample, respondents were required to report
on the activities of five business associates. This compares favorably with studies of large orgaruzations where studies of multiple
respondents still require respondents to represent the perceptions
of thousands of individuals. See Gerhart et al. (2000) for a more
detailed discussion of the trade-offs discussed here.

and 32 (14.3%) pursued manufacturing opportunities. Over one-third (36.7%) of the ventures asked
for funds and 63 (28.5%) ventures ultimately received
funds from an individual, friend or family member,
bank, government agency, or venture capitalist within
30 months of starting to pursue the business opportunity. Less than 10% of the ventures in the sample
received funding from venture capitalists.
Method and Measures
We analyze the venture financing process as a twostage selection process that evolves over time. In the
first stage, we hypothesize that specific characteristics of the venture will increase the hazard of seeking
financing from outside sources. In the second stage,
we hypothesize that specific characteristics of ventures which founders sought to finance will increase
the hazard that financiers will fund the ventures. In
our sample, no financier provided capital to a venture that a founder had not first decided to finance
externally.
Similar to Gompers (1995) and Carroll and Hannan
(2000), the hazard rate, or the probability of the event
of interest occurring given that the event has not yet
occurred, is specified as
probability that the event occurs between
month m and m -|- Am
h{m) probability that the event occurs after
month m.
Covariates are h5^othesized to influence the instantaneous probability of the event occurring by shifting
the baseline hazard rate (/ZQ). AS estimates are generated via maximum likelihood, with robust clustering
on each venture, we report chi-square as the model
fit statistic in our results. We examine the data in
monthly spells. Those ventures for which the event of
interest has not occurred by the end of 30 months are
treated as right censored.
We use the WeibuU hazard model for four reasons.
First, our data is right censored, as some of the 33%
of the ventures that sought financing but failed to
receive financing from external sources by the end
of the 30 month panel could have received financing
after our sampling frame ended. Second, the Akaike
information criterion test indicates that the WeibuU
model provides a better statistical fit to our data
than other hazard models (Akaike 1974, Blossfeld and
Rohwer 1995). Third, unlike the Cox proportional hazard model, the WeibuU model allows us to control
directly for the influence of venture age on the hazard
rates. Finally, the WeibuU model is commonly used
in hazard models in venture finance (Gompers and
Lerner 1999).

<-----Page 5----->Focused Issue: Multistage Selection and the Financing of New Ventures
Management Science 52(2), pp. 220-232, ©2006 INFORMS

We measure whether the founder sought funds
from an outside source (Stage 1) by asking the respondent, every six months, if the venture has sought
external funds. To measure if the venture received
funds from an external source (Stage 2), we asked
the respondent, every six months, if the venture
had received funds from an external source for the
first time. If the respondent indicated yes for either
question, we asked in which month that event first
occurred. We coded these variables 1 for each month
the event occurred; 0 otherwise. Hence, we are able to
identify by month if and when ventures were selected
into each stage.
Predictor Covariates
Founder Perceptions About the Business Oppor-

tunity. We predict that entrepreneurs are more likely
to seek funding from external sources as their positive
assessment of the prospects of the venture increases.
We measure the founder's self-assessment of the
prospects of the venture with the following questions:
Anticipated Market Growth. We measure the founders'

expectations of industry growth at the time of the
initial survey by asking the respondents to select,
from a four-point scale, whether they perceive market growth to be "diminishing" (1), "unchanged" (2),
"expanding" (3), or experiencing "strong expansion" (4). This variable is time invariant.
Anticipated Market Competition. We measure the

founders' perceptions of market competition at the
initial survey by asking the respondents to indicate on
a four-point scale whether, in the industry where they
plan to launch their business, they: "expect no competition" (0), "expect low competition" (1), "expect
moderate competition" (2), or "expect strong competition" (3). This variable is time variant.
Anticipated Employment Growth. We measure the

founders' perceptions of the expected size of the ventures by asking them, at each wave of the survey, to
indicate the number of employees that they anticipate
will be on the payroll in year Hve. This variable is
time variant.
Anticipated Price Competitiveness. We measure per-

ceptions of price competition by asking the respondents to indicate the importance of offering competitive prices to secure customers on a four-item scale
in which "0" equals "no importance," " 1 " equals
"marginal importance," "2" equals "importance," and
"3" equals "critical importance." This measure is time
invariant.
Objective Information About the Venture. We pre-

dict that financiers are more likely to provide funding
to specific ventures as positive objective information
about the venture increases. We measure the objective information about the venture with the following
covariates.

225

Organizing Activities. We measure organizing activities by asking five questions that prior research
has indicated are activities that are undertaken by
founders when organizing new ventures (Carter et al.
1996, Reynolds and White 1997). Every six months,
we asked respondents the following questions, coded
as "1" if the respondent answered "yes" and "0"
if the respondent answered "no": (1) Has the venture fUed the necessary forms with the tax authorities? (2) Has the venture registered with government
authorities? (3) Have any raw materials, inventory,
supplies, or components for the start-up been purchased? Have any major items like equipment, facilities, or property been purchased, leased, or rented
for the new start-up? ("Major" was defined as an
item with a retail value greater than U.S. $1,000.)
(4) Has the venture sought to obtain a patent, copyright, or trademark? (5) Has the venture sought to
obtain necessary permits or licenses to operate? Following prior research, we total these dichotomous
measures (Reynolds and White 1997) to yield a single
measure of venture-organizing activities that can be
objectively verified by potential investors. This variable is time variant.
Initiated Marketing. We measure the initiation of
marketing by asking the respondents every six
months whether they have initiated marketing. If they
indicate yes, we ask them at which month they initiated marketing. We code this variable "0" for every
month that they have not initiated marketing and "1"
thereafter. This variable is time variant.
Stage of Product Development. We measure the level

of product development completed by asking the
respondents every six months, "at what stage of
development is the product or service this start-up
will be selling?" The scale of responses was "1" equals
"no work has been done to develop a product or service;" "2" equals "work to develop the product or
service is still in the idea stage;" "3" equals "a model
or procedure is being developed;" "4" equals "a prototype or procedure has been tested with customers;"
and "5" equals "the product or service is completed
and ready for sales or delivery." This variable is time
variant.
Venture Sales. We measure the level of venture sales
by asking the respondents every six months to provide the sales they have earned by month. For every
month they recorded sales, we code the amount of
sales as the natural log of sales. Otherwise, we code
this variable "0." This variable is time variant.
Control Covariates

Prior research has indicated that the human capital
and reputation of founders is likely to influence the
likelihood that a venture will receive financing from
external sources. We independently control for two
dimensions of human capital and reputation, the prior

<-----Page 6----->226

startup experience and the industry experience of the
members of the founding team.
Start-up Experience. We measure the total number
of prior new ventures at the initial survey by asking,
"How many companies has each member of the venture team started previously?" This variable is time
invariant.
Industry Experience. We measure the total years of
industry experience of the start-up team at the initial
survey by asking, "How many years of experience in
the industry does each member of the venture team
have?" We sum industry-years across all members of
the team to compute the total industry experience for
the team. This variable is time invariant.
Completed Business Plan. We control for whether
or not the venture has a completed business plan
because having a completed business plan is Hkely
to increase the probability of being awarded external funding. Every six months, beginning with the
initial interview, we measure whether respondents
have completed a written business plan by asking,
"Has a business plan been written?" If they indicate
yes, we ask them at which month they completed the
business plan. We code this variable "0" for every
month that they have not completed a written business plan and " 1 " thereafter. This variable is time
variant.
Venture Age. We control for the age of the venture,
in months, because the likelihood that a venture will
receive external financing is affected by the age of the
venture. This variable is time variant.
Industry Sales Growth. We control for three dimensions of industry using data from Statistics Sweden,
the government agency that is the primary provider
of economic statistics in Sweden. The variables are
computed from a database that includes all firms
operating in the country. The database is updated
approximately 26 times a year with data provided by

industry in the year using data provided by Statistics
Sweden because new ventures in growing industries
should receive more external financing. This variable
is time variant.
Number of Firms in Industry. We control for the size
of the industry by including as a covariate the total
number of active firms in the industry as provided
by Statistics Sweden because new ventures in larger
industries may be more likely to be awarded external
financing. This variable is time variant.
Average Firm Age in Industry. We measure average firm age in the same five-digit industry for the

because new ventures in younger industries should
receive more external financing. This variable is time

Selection Correction
We analyze the venture financing process as a
two-stage selection process that evolves over time.
Therefore, we model the systematic selection on the
part of founders of ventures on which to seek funding in the regression to predict receipt of funding by
including a correction variable. A, in the second-stage
financier decision-to-fund regression to more accurately examine the relationship between hypothesized
covariates and selection for financing by investors in
the second stage (Klepper et al. 1983). Our correction
is based on Lee's (1983) generalization of Heckman's
two-stage selection model (Heckman 1979) calculated
as follows:
where Fjirn) is the cumulative hazard function for
founder selection into the pool of financing candidates for venture i at month m, (j) is the standard normal density function, and O"^ is the inverse
of the standard normal distribution function (Lee
1983). Because the hazard model used to generate the
predicted probabilities of seeking financing used to
compute A must include at least one covariate that
influences the hazard rate of asking for financing but
not the hazard of seeking funds from external sources
that is included as a covariate the Stage 1 regressions
but not the Stage 2 regressions (Little and Rubin 2002,
Frees 2004), we include as an additional predictor in
first-stage hazard models a dummy variable indicating if the venture is in a low-tech service industry.

Results
Panel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for
the 221 ventures included in the analysis at birth—
the first month each venture existed—while Panel B
of Table 1 provides the same summary statistics in
venture months for the entire 30-month period. Examination of Table 1 shows the importance of a dynamic
approach to venture finance, as attributes of the ventures that are potentially important to the financing
process change over time. For example, a comparison
between Panels A and B of Table 1 indicate that at the
start of the 30-month period most ventures had not
yet completed a business plan, and most had yet to
be paid for producing a product or service. Yet, over
time, a considerable number of ventures completed
a formal written business plan (27%) and most (over
58%) of the ventures booked sales.
Table 2 provides summary statistics for the first
month of selection into each stage, where Stage 1 is
the group of ventures selected by founders as candidates for external financing, and Stage 2 is the pool
of ventures from Stage 1 that were guarded funding
from external sources. As illustrated in Table 2, a preliminary inspection of the summary statistics indicates that a multistage selection model appears con-

sistent with the data. First, inspection of the means
for key variables for the ventures selected into each
stage of the finance process suggests that substantial differences exist between the underlying populations of firms at each stage. For example, the mean
of the sales variable increased drastically between the
initial sample of all 221 firms and the 81 firms that
survived the selection criteria in the first stage of
the venture finance process. Second, the first selection
event appears to be particularly important. Of the initial 221 ventures, only 81 (36%) are selected into the
pool of ventures that are candidates for external capital, but 63 (over 77%) of these candidates ultimately
received capital from external sources. Third, Table 2
indicates that the selection criteria may not be the
same at each stage. For example, financiers appear
to be more interested than entrepreneurs in financing
new ventures in smaller industries (the change in the
mean of this variable is positive between birth and
Stage 1, while negative between Stage 1 and Stage 2).
Therefore, it appears that the process which alters the
surviving sample in this study is not random and that
the way the financing process evolves is important to
understanding which firms ultimately receive fimds.
Table 3 provides the correlation matrix and Table 4
shows the results of the primary WeibuU models. We
report exponentiated coefficients in Table 4. Those
coefficients greater than one reflect a positive relationship between the coefficient and the propensity of an
event occurring, and values less than one reflect the
opposite.

Seeking External Capital
The model in Column 1 of Table 4 provides substantial support for Hypotheses 1. In Column 1 we report
the estimated association of model covariates on the
hazard of seeking capital from external sources. We
find that founders are approximately 3% more likely
to seek external financing for ventures that they anticipate will be growing in employment (p < 0,01), and
that founders are approximately 20% less likely to
seek external capital for ventures in markets that they
perceive are more competitive (p < 0,10). Further, they
are almost 50% more likely to seek capital from external sources for ventures that they anticipate will serve
more rapidly growing markets (p < 0.10). We did
not find a statistically significant relationship between
anticipated price competitiveness and the probability that a founder will seek financing from externai
sources. Overall, we find that founder perceptions
of the venture appear to have significant impact on
the decision to seek external financing. Among the
perceptions, we find that anticipated market growth
appears to have the largest effect in magnitude.
Receiving Capital Given that Capital Is Sought
The model in Column 2 of Table 4 provides considerable support for Hypotheses 2. In Column 2, we
report the estimated association of covariates on the
hazard of receiving funds on the sample of only those
81 ventures that were selected by founders as candidates for external financing. For each additional
orgaruzing activity completed, we find that ventures
are almost 50% more likely to receive capital from
externai sources given that capital has been sought
(p < 0.01). Similarly, ventures that have engaged in
marketing activities are almost twice as likely to be
awarded capital from external sources, given that
capital has been sought (p < 0.05), and each unit
increase in the log of sales is associated with an

approximate 17% greater likelihood that the venture will receive capital from external sources given
that capital has been sought (p < 0.01). However, we
find no statistically significant relationship between
the level of product development and the probability that a founder will receive financing from external sources conditional on seeking external financing.
Overall, we find that objective dimensions of venture development appear to have significant impact
on the probability that a venture will receive external
financing conditional on such financing being sought.
Among the perceptions, we find that irutiating marketing activities and undertaking organizing activities appear to have the largest effect in terms of
magnitude.
Examining the Validity and Impact of
the Multistage Selection Model
In Colurtm 3, we estimate a version of the Stage 2
model in which we do not include the founder selection A to show how failure to correct for systematic
selection by founders would yield different results.
The difference in the magnitude of the coefficients in
Columns 2 and 3 indicates that the estimates for the
effect of different factors on financiers' funding decisions would be incorrectly estimated without first correcting for founder selection of ventures as candidates
for external funding. For example, without correcting for founder selection, we find no evidence that
investors differentially select on the presence of business plans. However, when we properly correct for
founder selection, we observe a statistically significant
relationship between the presence of a business plan
and investors' financing decisions. This evidence suggests that failure to properly model both stages of the
process may lead researchers to inappropriately fail
to find support for key relationships.
In Column 4 of Table 4, we demonstrate empirically the differences between this multistage model of

venture finance and an alternate single-stage model,
by re-analyzing our data with a standard, single-stage
event history model to predict the hazard of receiving
funds from an outside source for the entire sample
of 221 ventures. By comparing the results shown in
Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4, we can also see the value
of the two-stage model for accurately evaluating the
venture finance process.
This effort indicates that key influences in the process are lost in the venture finance models that collapse both stages of the process into a single event. In
Column 4 of Table 4, we find no relationship between
anticipated market growth and the instantaneous

229
probability that a venture will receive funds from outside sources. However, when we appropriately model
the stages of the process, as is done in Columns 1
and 2 of Table 4, we find that this is a key characteristic influencing which ventures ultimately receive
funds from outsiders, as founders appear to differentially select ventures through the financing process
based on perceptions of anticipated market growth.
Finally, a researcher might infer from the single-stage
model in Column 4 that financiers differentially select
ventures for external financing based on founder perceptions of anticipated market competition. However,
by appropriately modeling the two stages of the process, we find that such an inference is incorrect. This
selection is driven by founder, not investor selection.
Therefore, failure to consider venture finance as a
multistage selection process will lead researchers to
systematically underestimate the importance of key
covariates on the successful receipt of external capital
from investors, as well as to give rise to the likelihood
that they will misattribute causal order.

Discussion and Implications
We examined why some new ventures and not others receive financing from external investors. We analyzed a uruque data set capturing the life histories
of 221 new ventures initiated in Sweden during the
first nine months of 1998. We modeled venture financing as an evolutionary selection process in which
foimders select ventures as candidates for external
capital based on their own positive assessments of the
ventures, while investors use objective characteristics
of the ventures to select which ventures to finance
from a pool of ventures that founders have put forth
as candidates for external financing. We showed how
failure to examine new venture finance through the
lens of multistage selection would cause researchers
to draw incorrect inferences about the venture finance
process.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, the study
examined new firm formation only in Sweden for
30 months spanning 1998 and 1999. As a result, time
or Sweden-specific attributes could limit the generalizability of the results to other periods or locations. However, we can identify no theoretical reason
why the results of this study should not generalize
to other periods or locations. Nevertheless, as with
single cotmtry studies of business phenomena in the
United States, future research in other countries using
similar research designs is necessary to demonstrate
the generalizability of the results.
Second, because we use key informants to provide information about the ventures we study,
individual-level biases in responding to questions

<-----Page 10----->230

might influence the responses we analyze. Unfortunately, the nature of the new firm creation process
makes it difficult to control for this bias. In the initial period of the life of the venture, which we study,
individuals often act alone to organize new firms.
Consequently, only the individual respondents possess the information about such aspects of their businesses such as orgaruzing activities imdertaken and
the search for capital. We sought to minimize biases in
interpretation by asking respondents about concrete
actions (e.g., did you write a business plan?). Nevertheless, the potential for individual-level bias in the
responses to our survey remains.
Third, as is the case with all longitudinal survey
research, our survey administration may have influenced the behavior of the foimders that we survey
(Schwab 2005). However, the timing and nature of the
questions that we ask, as well as our distance from
sources of capital, mitigate this concern.
Fourth, the amoimt of funding sought might signal the attractiveness of the venture and thus affect
the probability of obtaining external financing, conditional on it being sought. Because we do not have the
data, we cannot measure the effects of the amoimt of
funding sought on the probability of obtaining external financing. Our results are therefore limited by the
assumption that the amount of financing sought does
not influence the effect that objective characteristics
of the venture have on the probability that the venture receives external financing, conditional on such
financing being sought.
Implications
Our results make a powerful argument for the relevance of multistage selection to the study of social
processes in general (Baum and Singh 1994, Baum
and McKelvey 1999). True to the original variationselection-retention framework (Campbell 1969), we
find that selection events systematically influence the
observed characteristics of orgaruzations that successfully pass through the venture finance process. First,
internal and external selection criteria act in tandem
to shape the characteristics of new firms. In the specific case of venture finance, our results show that it
is necessary to explicitly address both selection events
to understand the evolution of the population of new
firms.
Second, the accumulation of selection events constrain future possibilities. We provide empirical evidence suggesting that path dependencies may occur
due to cumulative selection (Langolis and Everett
1994). Populations of ventures and firms that have
survived multiple irreversible stages of selection are
likely to have common characteristics that were necessary to survive the previous selection events. These
common characteristics may influence or constrain

Management Science 52(2), pp, 220-232, ©2006 INFORMS

future behavior. In our study, investors do not return
to the initial sample of 221 ventures when seeking
investments, and such a return is not likely to be possible because, as a consequence of founders' decisions,
the full set of ventures is unlikely to be made available
to investors. This is important because ventures with
desirable characteristics for selection at later stages
may be systematically underrepresented at the later
stages, due to their lack of selection at earlier stages.
In the specific case of venture finance, our study
shows that the screening actions of founders constrain the subsequent investment options of investors.
We find that founders base financing decisions on
their perceptions of market competition, price competition, and employment growth, while investors base
funding decisions on objective verifiable indicators
of venture development, such as the level of sales,
the extent that organizing activities have been completed, and the initiation of marketing efforts. Hence,
our study suggests that empirical investigations of
venture finance can be improved by examining it as
a multistage selection process, where the actions of
founders as well as investors are taken into account.
For example, our study suggests that research investigating factors that drive aspects of founder selection, such as recent work on why entrepreneurs prefer
investments from some venture capitalists over others (Hsu 2004), is likely to erd:iance our understanding
of why some ventures are more likely to successfully
raise capital from external sources. Similarly, as we
treat the receipt of fimding as a dichotomous variable,
a fruitful direction for further research would be to
examine if the model is robust to explaining the level,
or amount of funding received from external sources.
Third, our findings indicate that events that occur
early in the process of organization development may
be just as important as events that occur later in the
process, and failure to measure the early events can
hinder our understanding of organizational development. For example, much more of the selection
of ventures to receive external financing was undertaken by firm founders than by investors. As shown
in Table 2, only one-third (37%), or 81 of the initial
221 ventures, were presented to investors as candidates for financing. However, of those presented to
investors for funding, over three fourths (78%) ultimately received financing. If more of the selection on
dimensions other than venture finance occurs early
in the firm creation process, researchers who concentrate on later events might fail to fully understand
the process of firm development by systematically
under-measuring the early parts of the process. Similarly, failure to appropriately model specific selection
events early in the process may lead researchers to
misattribute causal order, or fail to find support for
important covariates in later stages.

Finally, the selection process has important implications for policy makers and founders. Our study
suggests that policies designed to stimulate venture finance by increasing the capital available to
entrepreneurs may ultimately prove less successful
than expected, as some ventures that exhibit characteristics important to investors are likely to never
become candidates due to systematic selection on the
part of founders. Similarly, our results indicate that
founders may wish to delay seeking capital from
external sources until objective information on the
prospects of their venture has been generated.
