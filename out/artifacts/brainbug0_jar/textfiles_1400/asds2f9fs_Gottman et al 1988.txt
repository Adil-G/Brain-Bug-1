Predicting MaritalHappiness and Stability from
Newlywed Interactions
A study with 130 newlywed couples was designed
to explore marital interaction processes that are
predictive of divorce or marital stability, processes
that further discriminate between happily and unhappily married stable couples. We explore seven
types of process models: (a) anger as a dangerous
emotion, (b) active listening, (c) negative affect
reciprocity, (d) negative start-up by the wife, (e)
de-escalation, (f) positive affect models, and (g)
physiological soothing of the male. Support was
not found for the models of anger as a dangerous
emotion, active listening, or negative affect
reciprocity. Support was found for models of the
husband's rejecting his wife's influence, negative
start-up by the wife, a lack of de-escalation of low
intensity negative wife affect by the husband, or a
lack of de-escalation of high intensity husband
negative affect by the wife, and a lack ofphysiological soothing of the male, all predicting divorce.
Support was found for a contingent positive affect
model and for balance models (i.e., ratio models)
of positive-to-negative affect predicting satisfaction among stable couples. Divorce and stability
were predicted with 83% accuracy and satisfaction
with 80% accuracy.

Recently some of our best scholars (e.g., Jacobson & Addis, 1993) have contended that marital
therapy has relapse rates so high that the entire
enterprise may be in a state of crisis. Consistent
with these conclusions, the recent Consumer Reports study of psychotherapy (Seligman, 1995)
also reported that marital therapy received the
lowest marks from psychotherapy consumers.
Marital therapy may be at an impasse because it
is not based on a process model derived from
prospective longitudinal studies of what real couples do that predicts if their marriages will wind
up happy and stable, unhappy and stable, or end
in divorce.
Differential longitudinal prediction of marital
satisfaction and stability may be an essential step
that has been omitted in designing marital therapy. Building a process model of marriage using
this prediction approach could turn out to be superior to building an intervention by imagining
what target populations in trouble may need or by
imagining it according to some theoretical position. What has happened in the field of marital
therapy is that a psychotherapy of marriage has
been constructed by extending methods of psychotherapy to the design of marital interventions,
instead of building a marital therapy from the way
people normally go about the process of staying
happily married. However, we should point out
that this is an assumption. This could be called
"the single theory assumption," which claims that
the functioning, dysfunctioning, and repair of
marital relationships can be explained using one

theory. Alternatively, it might be the case that any
process, such as active listening, might be a great
intervention, even if people don't naturally do it.
Thus, to use an analogy, it might be the case that
more than one set of "orthopedic knowledge" is
necessary in marriage, one about the normally developing "bones" of marriage and another about
how to repair "broken bones" in therapy. We do
not think that this will be the case.
We attempt to build such a process model of
marriage. What processes ought to be included
for investigation in building a process model? It
may be inadequate to simply describe what is
"dysfunctional" when a marriage is ailing. It may
be necessary to describe what is "functional"
when a marriage is working well. This may not be
redundantinformation.
"DYSFUNCTIONAL"
MODELSOF
MARITALPROCESSES

Two Models of Negative Affect: Anger
as a Destructive Emotion Versus
the "Four Horsemen"
The first set of processes concerns what might be
called "the specificity of negativity hypothesis."
It addresses the question of whether all negative
affects are equally corrosive in marriages. A pervasive model is that anger is destructive of marital relationships. For example, Hendrix (1988),
author of a bestselling book on marriage, wrote in
a section titled "The Destructive Power of Anger":
Angeris destructiveto a relationship,no matter
whatits form.Whenangeris expressed,the person on the receivingend of the attackfeels brutalized,whetheror not therehas been any physical violence; the old braindoes not distinguish
betweenchoice of weapons.Further,becauseof
the strange workings of the unconscious, the
personwho unleashesthe angerfeels equallyassaulted because on a deep level the old brain
perceivesall actionas inner-directed.
(p. 147)

need to apologize?Why do we raise our voices
whenit does no good?(p. 78)
In contrast, Winkler and Doherty (1983) reported that, compared with Jewish couples in the
United States, Jewish Israeli couples did not associate the amount of anger expressed in their marital interaction with marital dissatisfaction.
Gottman and Krokoff (1989) reported that, although anger was associated with lower concurrent marital satisfaction, it also was associated
with increases in marital satisfaction over time.
Gottman, Katz, and Hooven (1997) studied what
they called the "meta-emotion" philosophy of
emotional reactions and
parents-parents'
about
philosophies
anger and sadness. Parents'
meta-emotions about anger and sadness were related to the amount of coaching they did with
their children, the way they taught their children a
new task, their child's regulatory physiology,
their child's ability to focus attention, and a variety of child developmental outcomes.
Furthermore, in two longitudinal studies,
Gottman (1994) reported that anger in marital interaction did not predict divorce, whereas four
processes that he called "The Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse"-criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and "stonewalling" (listener withdrawal)reliably did predict divorce. Subsequent research
added "belligerence," a behavior that is provocative and that challenges the spouse's power and
authority. (For example: "What can you do if I do
go drinking with Dave? What are you gonna do
about it?") The current study with newlywed couples contrasted these two models of marital dysfunction.
Affect, Power, and Gender

This view of anger also was expressed by Parrott and Parrott (1995), who have a chapter titled
"The Deadly Emotion of Anger." They wrote:

Here we also consider models that interface between affect and power. There are two models of
interest. The first we discuss as negative affect reciprocity versus accepting influence, and the second we discuss as start-up-namely, who starts
the conflict discussion and how. We propose that
these processes are related and that they suggest
the differential roles that husbands and wives play
in maintaining marital stability and happiness.

It would be tough to find anotheremotion that

love the most? Why do we allow ourselves to

Negative reciprocity models and power. Using
observational data of marital interaction, the most
reliable empirical discriminator between happy
and unhappy marriages across laboratories, within
the U.S. and cross-nationally (Germany, Holland,

<-----Page 3----->Process Models of Marriage
and Spain) has been the negative affect reciprocity model. (For a review, see Gottman, 1994.) If
one partner is negative (for example, angry), the
spouse is much more likely to be negative than he
or she usually would be. We further distinguish
low-intensity negative affect reciprocity (sadness,
anger, whining, tension or fear, domineering)
from high-intensity negative affect reciprocity
(contempt, defensiveness, or belligerence). This is
the first time this distinction has been made, and
it is possible because of the design of the Specific
Affect Coding System (Gottman, McCoy, &
Coan, 1996). This makes it possible to refine further the negative affect reciprocity model by
breaking it into two types of hypotheses: negative
reciprocity in kind and escalating negativity. The
first sequence is a reciprocation in kind. Anger is
met with anger, for example. This model suggests
that marriages deteriorate because people cannot
"put the brakes on" or regulate the reciprocation
of negativity. These cycles of negativity characterize ailing marriages; they do not characterize
marriages that are working well.
The second model is rapid escalation of the
negativity in which any lower intensity negativity
like anger is met with an escalated negative affect
like belligerence, contempt, or defensiveness. We
recently have discovered that in the study of violent marriages this latter pattern of the husband's
escalation of his wife's low-level negative affect
indexes violent males' rejection of influence from
their wives (Coan, Gottman, Babcock, & Jacobson, in press). This interpretationof the sequence
also was supported by a recent dissertation in our
laboratory by Rushe (1995). This form of the sequence of negative affect reciprocity operationalizes the hypothesis into a specific gender pattern
that is primarily about power, not affect. The hypothesis is that marriages work to the extent that
men accept influence from women. This pattern
of functional marriage is indexed by men who do
not escalate the low-intensity negative affect of
women. Thus, it appears that issues of power
sharing are inherent in part of the pattern of negative affect reciprocity. We believe that it is important to distinguish these two models. One model
shows an "affect dysregulation" in ailing marriages (Hendrix, 1988; Markman, 1991). The
other suggests that dimensions of power need to
interface with dimensions of affect to understand
how "dysfunctional" patterns work in ailing marriages.

7
How conflict begins. This model, the negative
start-up model, is derived from of J. R. Patterson's writings about how coercive processes in
families start (e.g., Patterson, 1982). Start-up is
operationally defined as the escalation of conflict
from one partner's neutral affect to the other partner's negative affect. We hypothesize a specific
gender pattern based on the femaledemand/male-withdraw pattern. (See Christensen & Heavey, 1990; Heavey, Christensen, &
Malamuth, 1995; Heavey, Christopher, & Christensen, 1993.) Women typically start most of the
conflict discussions in laboratories that use observational methods (Ball, Cowan, & Cowan, 1995;
Oggins, Veroff, & Leber, 1993). A graph of moment-to-moment positive-minus-negative codes
using the Rapid Couples Interaction Scoring System found that the slope of these graphs was predictive a cascade toward divorce or marital stability and happiness (Gottman & Levenson, 1992).
A quantitative analysis of the amount of negative
interaction minus the amount of positive interaction during these conversations (Gottman, 1994)
showed that for 96% of these interactions, if the
graphs began in the first few minutes with a positive or a negative slope, they were not reversed.
In only 4% of the interactions was there a major
change in slope during the 15-minute interaction.
Hence, the way the interactions start may be critical in determining the couple's fate. The gender-specific hypothesis here is that marriages
will work to the extent that women soften their
start-up by not escalating from neutral to negative
affect.
"FUNCTIONAL"
OFMARITAL
MODELS
PROCESSES
The Active Listening Model
The most influential process theory of what is
functional in the context of the resolution of conflict in marriage may be called the active listening
model. This model also has been called a validation model (Gottman, Notarius, Gonso, & Markman, 1978; Markman, Stanley, & Blumberg,
1994; Notarius & Markman, 1993) and a mirroring model (Hendrix, 1988). It is the current way
of operationalizing empathy in marital interaction
across a spectrum of perspectives, from the behavioral perspective (Jacobson & Margolin,
1979) to the psychoanalytic object-relations perspective (Siegel, 1992). This model forms the
basis of most complex multi-component marital
treatments (e.g., see Jacobson & Gurman, 1995).

<-----Page 4----->Journal of Marriage and the Family

8
In most marital therapies, the active listening
model is reflected in some form of what has come
to be known as the listener-speaker exchange
(e.g., see Notarius & Markman, 1993). For example, suppose the wife starts as the speaker, and the
husband is the listener. First, she is asked to state
her complaints directly to the husband. Suppose
she complains that she is hurt by the way he relates to their youngest child. She hates the way he
ignores the boy and criticizes him. Then he is
asked to paraphrase, without defensiveness or
judgment, both the content and the feelings of his
wife's message and to check out his paraphrase.
Then he is asked to empathetically validate her
feelings. The hypothesis may be drawn that stable, happy marriages are characterized by such
exchanges during conflict resolution and that ailing marriages are characterized by the absence of
these kind of exchanges. The intellectual history
of this approach to marital therapy is from clientcentered therapy, adapted by Guerney for couples
(Guerey, 1982). However, there is a conceptual
leap in Guerney's application of these ideas to the
marital arena. In client-centered therapy the client
is usually complaining about a third person, and
the therapist is empathizing with the client against
a third party. When the client complains about the
therapist, it is usually called "resistance." Yet in
the marital arena, the spouse, even though the target of these complaints, is expected to empathize
with her or his partner.
De-Escalation Models
The de-escalation model (Gottman, 1979) suggests that what is important in functional relationships is the de-escalation of conflict, which involves moving from one partner's negative affect
(either high or low intensity) to the other partner's
neutral affect. Gottman found that husbands in
happy marriages were the ones most likely to deescalate low-intensity negative affect, and
wives in happy marriages were most likely to
de-escalate high-intensity negative affect.
Positive Affect Models
Another aspect of marital interaction that has received scant attention are models of positive affect
(such as humor, affection, and interest) in predicting the eventual fate of marriages. An exception
is Birchler, Weiss, and Vincent (1975), who used
a self-report diary measure of "pleases" and "displeases," a precursor of the Spouse Observation

Checklist, and a version of the Marital Interaction
Coding System to code general conversation
when they supposedly were setting up the equipment and the discussion of the Inventory of Marital Conflict (IMC; Olson & Ryder, 1970). In the
summary code of the Marital Interaction Coding
System, the positive interactions were agreement,
approval, humor, assent, laugh, positive physical
contact, and smile. Distressed couples produced
an average of 1.49 positive interations per minute;
nondistressed couples produced an average of
1.93 positive interations per minute, a significant
difference. In the home environment, distressed
partners recorded significantly fewer pleasing
events and significantly greater displeasing events
than nondistressed partnersdid.
We are interested in two forms of the positive
affect model. One simply suggests that positive
affect will be randomly distributed throughout the
conflict, without any connection to other processes. This is a kind of noncontingent or good-will
positive affect model. The second model of positive affect suggests that positive affect is used to
de-escalate marital conflict. It is in the service of
moving the overall affect from a negative to a less
negative (even a neutral affective) state. In this
contingent positive affect model, the underlying
or related purpose of the positive affect involves
de-escalation and possibly physiological soothing
of self or partner (Gottman, 1990). This model
will be tested against the model of good-will positive affect, using structural equations modeling
in which the path coefficient between positive affect and de-escalation will be compared across
newlyweds who eventually wound up in one of
three criterion groups: divorced, married but unhappy, or married and happy.
Balance Models
One way of integrating negative and positive affect models is to suggest the importance of a balance of positive and negative affect. In these balance models, the couple maintains a set point of
the ratio of positivity to negativity that is functional if it is high or dysfunctional if it is low. The
balance models are not redundantbecause, for example, if only a negativity model were validated,
it would suggest that a goal of marital therapy
ought to be declaring war on negative affect. Intuitively, such a conclusion seems absurd. A marriage in which there is no negative affect and in
which people were cheerful and positive all the
time would seem to be one version of Sartre's re-

<-----Page 5----->Process Models of Marriage
lationship hell, one that is reminiscent of the film
The Stepford Wives in which suburban husbands
conspire to murder their wives and replace them
with cheerful robot copies. A balance model
would maintain that a marriage is like a stable,
predator-prey behavioral ecology, in which there
is a balance between the necessary predator of
negative affect and the necessary prey of positive
affect. The ratio of pleases to displeases in Birchler, Weiss, and Vincent's study (1975) also discriminated between the groups. (The ratio was
29.66 for nondistressed couples and 4.30 for distressed couples.) We employed an observational
system that obtained considerably more detail and
specificity than the Marital Interaction Coding
System of Birchler and colleagues obtained in the
realm of emotion, for both positive and negative
affect (Gottman, 1996). Hence, another form of
the positive affect model is the ratio model, which
suggests that what is important is the relative
amount of positive to negative affect. Gottman
(1994) reported that in three types of stable marriages that he identified, the ratio of positive to
negative interaction during conflict resolution
was 5 to 1, whereas the ratio was .8 to 1 in unstable marriages.
The Potential Importance of Physiological
Soothing of the Male
Why might positive affect and de-escalation be
related to the relapse effect in marital therapy?
We propose that the link lies in the couple's ability to physiologically soothe self and partner. In
many marital therapies, partly through the influence of Murray Bowen's work (for a review, see
Papero, 1995), the therapist soothes the couple so
that in the analysis of process they will rationally
examine their dysfunctional patterns of interaction. The hypothesis is that if the therapist plays
this role instead of the couple, relapse may be the
result. That is, we predict a good outcome for the
couple to the extent that they, themselves, are
able to soothe self and partner.
There may be differences in how important
this physiological soothing is according to gender. Gottman and Levenson (1988) reviewed evidence for the hypothesis that men and women differ in their responses to negative affect in marriage and in other close relationships. They
proposed that the research suggests that in the climate of negative affect that pervades unhappy
marriages, men withdraw emotionally, and
women do not. Since their review appeared, there

9
has been considerable empirical support for this
contention, and it has been called the femaledemand/male-withdraw pattern by Christensen
and his associates (e.g., Christensen, 1987, 1988,
1990; see also Gottman, 1994, on female criticism and male stonewalling). There is also evidence that babies do not socially reference their
unhappily married fathers but do continue to socially reference their unhappily married mothers
(Dickstein & Parke, 1988). The evidence for this
emotional withdrawal of the male in ailing families is so widely recognized that it has become the
subject of national conferences (e.g., the National
Conference on Men in Families in 1996). Writers
have presumed that it is related to what has been
called "the absent father" and the widespread
abandonment of children by fathers after divorce.
(See Griswold, 1993; Parke, 1996; Popenoe,
1996.)
Gottman and Levenson (1988) hypothesized
that this gender difference is based, in part, on a
biological difference between the sexes. Their hypothesis was that men are in some ways more reactive to stress than women, particularly in the
adrenergic parts of the cardiovascular system and
in the stress-related endocrine responses that accompany active coping, particularly the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline (Obrist,
1981). There is some evidence to suggest that this
difference is found physiologically (in the autonomic nervous system and endocrine responses)
and in emotion-related behaviors. (For a review,
see Polefrone & Manuck, 1987.) Recent evidence
suggests that this gender difference may be particularly pronounced in the vigilance-startle system (McCarter & Levenson, 1996) and that there
is a greater male adrenergic-cardiovascular response to acoustic startling in terms of the reactivity of the heart rate and vasoconstrictive responses.
Because of the aversive nature of diffuse autonomic arousal, men may attempt to avoid negative affect in close relationships because it is
more physiologically punishing for them than for
women. Gottman (1994) reported that, emotionally, males are flooded by lower levels of negative
affect than females are. To evaluate this hypothesis, in the study presented here, variables related
to either partner's positive affect and to either
partner's de-escalation of conflict were used as
events in interrupted time-series analyses of
heart-rate data collected synchronously with the
video time code. The extent to which the soothing
of either spouse occurred then was assessed and

<-----Page 6----->10

used as a predictor of marital outcome. The
Gottman-Levenson hypothesis would be supported only if the only predictors of marital outcomes
involved the physiological soothing of the male.
To summarize, we are asking questions about
what interactive processes are dysfunctional and
what are functional in the context of a longitudinal prediction study. We explore seven types of
models: (a) anger as the destructive emotion versus the Four Horsemen; (b) active listening; (c)
negative affect reciprocity: in kind (either low or
high intensity) and husband escalation (indexing
dimensions of power and gender, specifically the
husband's refusal to accept influence); (d) negative start-upby the wife; (e) de-escalation: low intensity by the husband or high intensity by the
wife; (f) positive affect models: contingent, noncontingent, and ratio; (g) physiological soothing
of the male. We will ask these questions in the
context of a representative sample of 130 newlyweds from the Seattle area. We studied these 130
couples over a 6-year period in cohorts of approximately 40 couples per cohort. Our follow-up period has varied from 3 to 6 years. There were 17
divorces in that time. We then took 20 comparable couples with high marital satisfaction and 20
with low marital satisfaction as comparison
groups.
METHOD
Participants
Between 1989 and 1992, we used a two-stage
sampling procedure to draw a sample of newlywed couples from the Puget Sound area in Washington. Couples initially were recruited using
newspaper advertisements. To be eligible for the
study, the couples had to have married for the
first time within 6 months of participating in the
study, and they had to be childless. Couples were
contacted by phone and administered our telephone version of the Marital Adjustment Test
(MAT; Krokoff, 1987; Locke & Wallace, 1959)
and surveyed to determine their eligibility on the
other criteria. The MAT measures marital satisfaction. Higher scores represent higher marital
satisfaction. There were 179 newlywed couples
who met the research criteria and participated in
the initial survey phase of the study. In this phase,
husbands and wives separately were mailed a set
of questionnaires to fill out that included measures of demographic characteristics and indices
about their marriage, well-being, and health.

In the second phase of the study, 130 newlywed couples who represented an even distribution
of marital satisfaction were invited to participate
in a marital interaction laboratory session and
complete additional questionnaires. These couples fit perfectly the demographic characteristics
of the major ethnic and racial groups in the
greater Seattle area, according to the Seattle City
Metropolitan Planning Commission Report. The
demographic characteristics for these newly married couples were: wife's age = 25.4 years (SD =
3.5); husband's age = 26.5 years (SD = 4.2);
wife's marital satisfaction = 120.4 (SD = 19.7);
husband's marital satisfaction = 115.9 (SD =
18.4).
Marital Status and Criterion Groups
Once each year, the marital status and satisfaction
of the 130 couples in the study were assessed. At
the end of the 6-year period (called Time 2 in this
article), there had been 17 divorces-six in the
first cohort, six in the second, and five in the
third. The mean number of years married among
the divorced couples was 3 (SD = .79). The lowest of each couple's Time-2 scores on the LockeWallace marital satisfaction measure were used to
form two similarly sized criterion groups of stable
couples-the 20 most happily married and the 20
most unhappily married. The mean score of marital satisfaction at Time 2 of the stable, happily
married group was 128.30 (SD = 27.65), and the
mean score of marital satisfaction at Time 2 of
the stable and unhappily married group was 90.70
(SD = 16.08).
Procedures and Measures
Behavioral observation. Two remotely controlled
VHS video cameras recorded both spouses during
the interaction sessions. The images from the two
cameras were combined in a split-screen image.
Microphones recorded the couple's audio interactions. The computer synchronized physiological
data with video data by utilizing the elapse-time
codes imposed on the video recordings. The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF; Gottman,
McCoy, & Coan, 1996) was used to code the couples' conflict interactions. The system indexed
specific affects expressed during the session of
problem resolution. SPAFF focuses solely on the
affects expressed. The system draws on facial expression (based on Ekman & Friesen's, 1978, system of facial action coding), vocal tone, and

<-----Page 7----->Process Models of Marriage
speech content to characterize the emotions displayed. Coders categorized the affects displayed
using five positive codes (interest, validation, affection, humor, joy), 10 negative codes (disgust,
contempt, belligerence, domineering, anger,
fear/tension, defensiveness, whining, sadness,
stonewalling), and a neutral affect code. Every
videotape was coded in its entirety by two independent observers using a computer-assisted coding system that automated the collection of timing
information. Each coder noted only the onset of
each code. A time-locked confusion matrix for
the entire videotape then was computed using a 1second window for determining agreement of
each code in one observer's coding against all of
the other observers' coding. (See Bakeman &
Gottman, 1986.) The diagonal versus the diagonal-plus-off-diagonal entries in these matrices
then were entered into a repeated measures analysis of variance using the method specified by
Wiggins (1977). We computed the Cronbach alphas for each code as the ratio of the mean square
for observers minus the error mean square and the
mean square for observers plus the error mean
square. (See also Bakeman & Gottman, 1986.)
The Cronbach's alpha generalizability coefficients ranged between .651 and .992 and averaged .907 for the entire coding of all 130 videotapes.
Physiological measures. During the first year of
data collection, we measured physiological responses with polygraphs and a computer to record
and store the physiological data. The electrocardiogram was collected, and interbeat intervals
were calculated as the time in milliseconds between consecutive R-waves. General somatic activity was indexed by an electromechanical transducer under the platform supporting each
spouse's chair.
Self-report of affect. After the marital interaction,
spouses viewed a videotape of it and were asked
to recall how they felt during the interaction.
They used a rating dial to provide a continuous
self-report measure of their emotional evaluation
of the marital interaction.
Questionnaires.We used the MAT (Locke-Wallace,
1959), as well as our telephone version of the
MAT, which has strong psychometric properties
(Krokoff, 1987). The Couple's Problem Inventory
(CPI; Gottman, Markman, & Notarius, 1977) was
filled out by the study participantsjust prior to the

11
marital discussion of areas of disagreement during the marital interaction phase of the study.
Couples used the inventory to rate the severity of
issues in their marriage. Items include areas of
standard marital problems such as in-laws, finances, and sex. Each item is rated on a scale of
0-100. Higher scores signify that the problem is
considered more severe.
Laboratory Procedures
The marital interaction assessment consisted of a
discussion by the husband and wife of a problem
that was a source of ongoing disagreement in
their marriage and two recall sessions in which
the couples viewed their discussion of their marital disagreement. After the couple completed the
CPI, the experimenter reviewed with the couple
the issues they rated most problematic and helped
them to choose several to use as the basis for the
discussion. After choosing the topics for the discussion, couples were asked to sit quietly and not
interact with each other during a 2-minute baseline. The couples discussed their chosen topics for
15 minutes and then viewed the video recording
of the interaction. In counterbalanced order, the
husband and wife first viewed and rated their own
affect during the discussion and then viewed and
rated their spouse's affect. Both the husband and
wife used rating dials that provided continuous
self-report data. We collected continuous physiological measures and video recordings during all
of the interaction sessions, and data were averaged over 1-second intervals.
One way to operationalize the active listening
sequences would be to look for sequences in
which one partner expressed negative affect and
the other partnervalidated the negative affect. We
cast a wider net than this and examined all sequences in which one spouse first expressed lowintensity or high-intensity negative affect, and
this was then followed by either interest, affection, humor, or validation by the partner. Thus,
we searched for sequences that might be even
partially reflective of active listening-for example, a sequence in which one partner complains
and the other partner responds warmly, perhaps
not exactly with validation, but with a great deal
of active interest, affection, or shared humor. By
low-intensity negative affect, we mean the
SPAFF codes anger, sadness, whining, disgust,
tension and fear, or stonewalling. The SPAFF
codes for high-intensity negative affect are belligerence, contempt, or defensiveness. The higher-

<-----Page 8----->12
intensity negative affect codes are more predictive of divorce (Gottman, 1994). Negative affect
reciprocity models mean the reciprocation of negative affect in kind, either high intensity or low
intensity. The refusing-to-accept-influence models involved the escalation of the intensity of negative affect from one partner's low-intensity negative affect to the other partner's high-intensity
negative affect. Negative start-up involved a sequence of one partner's neutral affect to the
other's negative affect, either high or low intensity. De-escalation sequences involved the couple
moving from either low-intensity negative affect
to neutral affect or from high-intensity negative
affect to neutral affect. The positive affect models
involved either the amount of positive affect or
the ratio of positive affect to positive plus negative affect, all computed for one spouse.
To examine whether the positive affect events
or the de-escalation sequences were related to
physiological soothing and whether, as predicted,
physiological soothing involves primarily the
male, we used the heart rate data that were timelocked with the SPAFF codes. The analysis proceeded in two phases. First, we used interrupted
time-series analyses to assess whether or not a
particular positive affective event (interest, excitement, affection, and humor by either spouse)
or a de-escalation event (by either spouse) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in
heart rate or a significant downturn in the
heart rate slope of either spouse. De-escalation
was defined as negative affect by one spouse, followed immediately in the next second by neutral
affect from the partner. That neutral affect had to
last for at least 5 seconds. The Crosbie computer
program was used for these time-locked interrupted time-series analyses (Crosbie, 1993). A constant 5-second preevent interval and a constant 5second postevent interval was used for these analyses. Next, we computed the number of
statistically significant soothing events, compared
with all such events in a couple's record. These
frequencies then were entered into a log-linear
analysis to predict which of the three criterion
groups-divorced, stable and happy, or stable and
unhappy-a couple was in. These data can predict
marital outcomes in a number of ways. Many
models are possible. However, the most interesting model to us involves hypotheses of the importance to marital outcomes of the physiological
soothing of the male because Gottman and Levenson (1988) hypothesized that it is the physiological arousal of the male that is likely to be the

Journal of Marriage and the Family
most important determinant of sequences of both
escalation of negative affect and emotional withdrawal. This hypothesis suggests that marriages
will work to the extent that they provide for
soothing of the male. The soothing can imply
self-soothing, or it can imply soothing of the male
by the female.
RESULTS

The analyses pursued two types of predictions: a
marital stability prediction in which we combined
the two stable groups (happy and unhappy) and
attempted to predict divorce or stability from their
Time-i marital interaction (taken in the first 6
months of marriage), and a marital happiness prediction, in which, controlling for stability, the prediction was to a couple's Time-2 marital happiness or unhappiness (from their Time-i marital
interaction taken in the first 6 months of marriage). For all sequences, this procedure was followed: A sequence first was examined that indexed a particular process model. If the results
turned out to be statistically significant, a covariance analysis also was conducted, using the frequency of the consequent code as the covariate.
This was a stringent approach to the fundamental,
sequential connection question, "Was the consequent more predictable from the antecedent than
its base rate of occurrence?" (Gottman & Roy,
1990). Without this test, it cannot be known if a
high joint frequency of occurrence was not due
simply to a high base rate of the consequent, or if
a low joint frequency of occurrence is not due
simply to a low base rate of the consequent. However, not all laboratories agree that a covariance
analysis is the most meaningful way of analyzing
for sequential connection. For example, the Oregon Social Learning Center employs only sequential measures such as conditional probabilities because of the valid point that they are more clearly
interpretable. We present both analyses. Finally,
in our data analysis we construct a path analytic
model that attempts to link several theoretical
process models to positive affect to determine if
the positive affect model was contingent on or independent of other marital interaction processes.
This analysis attempted to fit the same model to
all three criterion groups and then to compare the
same model across groups.

criminate between happy and unhappy stable
marriages. However, in the model based on the
Four Horsemen, both husband's and wife's highintensity negative affect, (the sum of belligerence,
defensiveness, and contempt) did predict divorce,
but did not predictively discriminate between
happy stable and unhappy stable marriages. The
wife's low-intensity negative affect-the sum of
whining, anger, sadness, domineering, disgust,
fear, and stonewalling-did predict divorce, but it
did not predictively discriminate between happy
and unhappy stable marriages.
In the stability analyses, the active listening F
ratios for interest, affection, humor, and validation following the expression of negative affect
by the partner were .06, .24, .12, and .00, respectively, all nonsignificant. These sequences occurred infrequently for all couples, totaling approximately 4 seconds out of 900. Using all four
variables in a discriminant function analysis, x2
(4) = 3.92, ns. In the satisfaction analyses, the F
ratios were .77, .00, .02, and 3.92, respectively,
all nonsignificant. Using all four variables in a
discriminant function analysis, x2 (4) = .32, ns.
These active listening exchanges hardly ever occurred, and they were not predictive of differential marital outcomes.
Negative Reciprocity Models
Reciprocating negativity in kind: low-intensity
negative affect. Examining the reciprocation of
low-intensity negative affect, we found that the F
ratios for the stability analyses were 9.12, p =
.003, for the husband's reciprocation of negativity
and 12.10, p = .001, for the wife's reciprocation
of negativity (both significant). The unstable couple engaged in these sequences an average of
10.65 and 11.59 seconds, whereas the stable couples engaged in these sequences an average of
4.09 and 3.95 seconds, respectively. We conducted a covariance analysis with the consequent as
the covariate, and the F ratios became F(2,109) =
2.54, ns, for the husband's reciprocation of nega-

tivity and F(2,109) = 4.39, p = .038, for the wife's
reciprocation of negativity. Hence, in the first few
months of marriage, wives in marriages that are
going to be unstable are more likely to reciprocate
low-intensity negative affect than wives in marriages that are going to be stable. The respective
F ratios for the happiness analyses were 5.81, p =
.0176, and 4.50, p = .0362. Conducting a covariance analysis with the consequent as the covariate, however, we found that both F ratios became
nonsignificant, F(1,126) = 3.85, p = .052, and
F(1,126) = 3.43, p = .066.

Reciprocating negativity in kind: high-intensity
negative affect. We examined the reciprocation of
high-intensity negative affect, and the F ratios for
the stability analyses were 8.03, p = .006, for the
husband's reciprocation of high-intensity negativity and 4.88, p = .031, for the wife's reciprocation
of high-intensity negativity, both significant. The
unstable couples engaged in these sequences an
average of 22.65 and 16.06 seconds, whereas the
stable couples engaged in these sequences an average of 6.78 and 6.90 seconds, for the husband's
and wife's reciprocation, respectively. Conducting a covariance analysis with the consequent as
the covariate, however, we found that both F ratios became nonsignificant, F(1,54) = 3.11, p =
.083, and F(1,54) = .45, ns. The respective F ratios for the happiness analyses were .90, ns, and
1.64, ns, for the husband's and wife's reciprocation, respectively. Hence, reciprocating high intensity negativity in kind did not predict either
marital instability or unhappiness among the stable couples.
In eight predictions, in the covariance analyses
only one and one not anticipated-the wife's reciprocation of low-intensity negative affect in
kind-was significant for the prediction of marital instability.
Refusing to accept influence: the escalation of negative affect models. For the stability analyses, the F
ratios were 17.40, p = .0001, for the husband reject-

<-----Page 10----->14

Journal of Marriage and the Family

ing influence from his wife, and 5.02, p = .029, for
the wife rejecting influence from her husband.
However, the covariance analyses yielded F(1,126)
= 10.53, p = .002, and F(1,126) = .98, ns, respectively. For the happiness analyses, the F ratios
were .30, ns, and 1.18, ns, for husbands and wives,
respectively. Hence, as expected, the evidence
shows that divorce was predicted only by the husband's refusing to accept influence from his wife.
Negative Start-Up Model
The F ratios for stability were 6.83, p = .01, for
the husband's start-up and 8.79, p = .004, for the
wife's start-up. However, the covariance analysis
revealed that F(1,126) = 1.03, ns, for the husband's
start-up and F(1,126) = 10.81, p = .0001, for the
wife's start-up. Hence, as expected, there was evidence only for the wife's start-up predicting divorce. For the happiness analyses, F ratios were
3.64, p = .059, and .13, ns, respectively. The covariance analyses for the marginally significant
effect revealed that F(1,109) = .08, ns, respectively.
De-Escalation Models
De-escalating low intensity negativity. The F ratios for stability were 7.30, p = .009, for the husband's de-escalation and 3.81, p = .056, for the
wife's de-escalation. In the covariance analyses,
for the wife's de-escalation, F(1,126) = 1.35, ns,
but for the husband's de-escalation, F(1,126) =
6.47, p = .014. Hence, as expected, there was evidence that the husband's de-escalation of lowintensity negative affect predicts marital stability,
which is consistent with results reported by
Gottman (1979). For the happiness analyses, the
F ratios were 2.69, ns, and 1.86, ns, respectively.
De-escalating high-intensity negative affect. The
second de-escalation sequence involved the couple moving from high-intensity negative affect to
neutral affect. The F ratios for stability were 3.47,
p = .068, for the husband's de-escalation, and
2.53, ns, for the wife's de-escalation. The F ratios
for the covariance analyses were 3.29, p = .072,
for the husband's de-escalation and 2.12, ns, for
the wife's de-escalation. The absence of a stability
effect for the wife's de-escalation of highintensity negative affect is inconsistent with results reported by Gottman (1979). For the happiness analyses, the F ratios were .56, ns, and .07,
ns, respectively, and the discriminant function
was X2(2) = .88, ns.

Positive Affect Models
Next we examined positive affect. The amount of
positive affect was significantly related to stability, with F ratios 7.67, p = .008, for husband positive affect, and 7.64, p = .008, for wife positive
affect (stable husbands = 62.23 seconds, unstable
husbands = 31.76 seconds; stable wives = 59.05
and unstable wives = 31.23 seconds), discriminant function x2 (2) = 8.74, p = .013. Positive affect also was related to happiness, with F ratios
5.27, p = .027, for the husband's positive affect,
and 8.25, p = .007 for the wife's positive affect,
X2(2) = 8.14,p = .017.
Positive-to-negative affect ratio model. We computed the ratio of positive affect to the sum of
positive and negative affect for each wife and
husband. For the stability analyses, the F ratios
were 9.56, p = .003 for the wife's ratio, and 9.96,
p = .003 for the husband's ratio, respectively, x2
(2) = 10.57, p = .0051. (M for stable husbands =
.42, unstable husbands = .16; M for stable wives
= .38, unstable wives = .15.) For the happiness
analyses, the F ratios were 5.88, p = .020, and
1.61, ns, respectively, for husband and wife ratios, with discriminant function %2(2) = 5.36, p =
.069. (M for happy husbands = .49, unhappy husbands = .36; M for happy wives = .48, unhappy
wives = .27.)

Contingent versus noncontingent positive affect
models. The analyses we conducted revealed that
positive affect was the only variable that predicted marital stability and also was able to discriminate between stable, happily married couples and
stable, unhappily married couples. To understand
the role of positive affect, we constructed a path
analytic model among the following variables:
positive affect, the sum of husband and wife bat'em-back sequences, the sum of husband and wife
de-escalation sequences, and the sum of husband
and wife negative reciprocity sequences (combining reciprocity of low- and high-intensity negative affect).
The model Figure 1 constructed, using the
Bentler computer program EQS (1989), was successful in fitting the covariance matrices of all
three groups. For the stable and happily married
group, X2 (1) = .35, p = .55, Bentler-Bonett
Normed Index (BBN) = .992, Comparative Fit
Index (CFI) = 1.00; for the stable and unhappily
married group, x2 (1) = .25, p = .62, BBN = .991,
CFI = 1.00, and for the divorced group, x2 (1) =

.40, p = .53, BBN = .970, CFI = 1.00. We then
compared the models across all three groups. The
omnibus test showed that the path coefficients for
the three groups were significantly different,
X2(11) = 22.87, p = .018. Testing specific path coefficients with cumulative multivariate statistics
showed that the paths between variables 3 and 4
were significantly different across groups, as
were the paths between 2 and 4 and between 2
and 3. (Model specifications are available from
the author.) Only in the stable, happy group was
there a positive association between de-escalation
and positive affect (variables 3 and 4). In the
other two groups, the path coefficient was negative. The relationship between escalation (variable 2, bat-'em-back) and positive affect (variable
4) was more negative in the stable, happy group
than in the stable, unhappy group and in the divorced group. The relationship between escalation (variable 2) and de-escalation (variable 3)
was stronger in the stable, happy group than in
the other two groups.

de-escalation, the Four Horsemen, and total positive affect, was employed in making predictions
about both divorce and satisfaction. For the divorce prediction, the canonical correlation was
.69, with a correct stability-divorce prediction of
82.5%. For the satisfaction prediction among the
stable couples, the canonical correlation was .60,
with a correct stability-divorce prediction of 80%.
The only one-tailed statistically significant
predictions of marital outcome involved the physiological soothing of the male by either the male
himself or by the female. The events that were involved in this prediction were de-escalation by
the husband, G2 (2) = 9.20, p < .01; humor by the
wife, G2 (2) = 3.80, p < .05; validation by the husband G2 (2) = 10.60, p < .01; affection by the husband, G2 (2) = 8.10, p < .01. Figures 2-5 summarize these statistically significant predictions of
marital outcome obtained by the probabilities that
these positive events would result in significant
physiological soothing of the male. Figure 2
shows that the probability that humor by the wife
significantly decreased the husband's heart rate
was significantly higher in couples who eventually wound up stable and happy than in the other
two groups of couples. Figure 3 shows that the
probability that de-escalation by the husband significantly decreased his own heart rate was significantly higher in couples that eventually wound
up stable and happy than in the other two groups
of couples. Figure 4 shows that the probability
that validation by the husband significantly decreased his heart rate was significantly higher in
couples that eventually wound up stable and
happy than in the other two groups of couples.
Figure 5 shows that the probability that affection
by the husband significantly decreased his heart
rate was significantly higher in couples who
eventually wound up stable and happy than in the
other two groups of couples.
The same discriminant function model was
employed in making predictions of both divorce
and satisfaction. For the divorce prediction, the
canonical correlation was .69, with a correct
stability-divorce prediction of 82.5%. For the
satisfaction prediction among the stable couples,
the canonical correlation was .60, with a correct
stability-divorce prediction of 80%.

riages.Instead,we foundevidencethatreplicated
the Gottmanfindingsthatcontempt,belligerence,
and defensiveness were the destructivepatterns
duringconflictresolution.Ouranalysessuggested
thatthe active listeningmodel, which is the most
commoncomponentof currentmodels of marital
therapy,occurredinfrequentlyin the resolutionof
maritalconflict and was not predictiveof differentialmaritaloutcomes.
We needto convey how shockedandsurprised
we were by these results for the active listening
model. We expectedthatthe validationsequence
would predict positive outcomes in marriages.
We have recommended this intervention
(Gottman,1979;Gottman,1994;Gottman,Notarius, Gonso, & Markman,1978). To deal with our
shockandsurprise,we conducteda seriesof qualitative analyses on the data from this study and
from anotherlongitudinalcohort we have been
following for 13 years. We examined in detail
every videotape and transcriptof every stable,
happycouple.It was not a big surpriseto find that
theirspousesvery
couples were not paraphrasing
often. We also found thatthey were not summarizing their partner'sfeelings (e.g., "Soundslike
this makesyou prettymad"),nor even summarizing the content of their spouse's statements
("You'd like it if we saved more money each
month").Furthermore,
they almostnevervalidated theirspouse's feelings (e.g., "I can understand
why this wouldmakeyou upset").Furtherexamination of the validationcode of the SPAFF revealed that our observerswere using our validation code exclusively for what Duncanand Fiske
(1977) had called "listenerbackchannels."These
are the usual brief vocalizations,head nods, and
facial movementsthatconvey to the speakerthat
the listeneris tracking.
Instead,in the quantitativeanalysesof process,
we found that there was a particularpatternof

modelsthatpredicteddivorce.The patternpredictive of divorcewas negativestart-upby the wife,
refusal of the husbandto accept influence from
his wife, wife's reciprocationof low intensity
negativityin kind,andthe absenceof de-escalation
of low intensitynegativityby thehusband.The only
variablethat predictedboth maritalstabilityand
maritalhappinessamong stable couples was the
amountof positive affect in the conflict.Through
pathmodeling,we foundthatonly in coupleswho
eventually wound up stable and happy was this
positiveaffect contingent,actingin the serviceof
the de-escalationof negativity.Also, only in this
group, if couples refused to accept influence,
were they also likely to de-escalate.The relationship betweenescalation(bat-'em-back)and positive affect was more negative in the stable and
happygroupthanin the stableandunhappygroup
we found
andin the divorcedgroup.Furthermore,
supportfor the hypothesisthatpositive affect and
de-escalationare predictiveof positive outcomes
in the marriageto the extentthatthe positiveaffect
or de-escalationinvolvedthe physiologicalsoothing of the maleeitherby his partneror himself.
We concludethatthe marriagesthatwoundup
happy and stable had a softened start-upby the
wife, that the husbandaccepted influence from
her, that he de-escalatedlow-intensity negative
affect, that she was likely to use humorto effectively soothe him, and that he was likely to use
positive affect and de-escalation to effectively
soothe himself. The alternativeto the active listening model suggested by these analyses is a
model of gentleness,soothing,and de-escalation
of negativity (negativity by one spouse is followed by the partner'sneutralaffect). In contrast
to this gentle de-escalationand soothing,the active listening model is a more confrontational
model in the sense that it expects people to be
able to be empatheticin the face of negative affect directedat them by their spouses. Based on

our analyses, we are led to the hypothesis that the
active listening model may be expecting a form of
emotional gymnastics from people who, at that
moment in that relationship, are somewhat emotionally disabled by conflict. We found that even
couples in stable, happy marriages do not do this
active listening naturally. Active listening, although it may make intuitive sense as a model of
empathy, may be misguided. After all, even in
client-centered, individual therapy, the client is
generally complaining about a third party, and the
therapist empathizes. In some senses, the prominent active listening model of marital therapy
may amount to a kind of celebration of conflict.
Hendrix (1988) has suggested that the active listening model is the way to "understand one's
partner's inner world" (p. 118). The suggestion
often has been made in advice books that conflict
is, in fact, the road to intimacy in marriages. For
example, the subtitle of Wile's (1988) book is
"How Conflict Can Improve Your Relationship."
Markman, Stanley, and Blumberg (1994) suggest
that, because conflict is inevitable, managing conflict is an essential communication skill and that
the active listening model "may be very different
from the way you normally might do things, but
that's the point. Like any skill, these new suggestions become easier with practice" (p. 9). Other
writers also have raised questions about how difficult active listening may be for couples in their
everyday lives in the midst of conflict (e.g., Wile,
1988; N. S. Jacobson, personal communication,
June 4, 1996).
The generally negative results of our analyses
in the models of negative affect reciprocity in
kind show that negative affect reciprocity in kind
does not, in general, predict negative marital outcomes. There was only evidence that in the first
few months of marriage the wife in a marriage
that is going to be stable is more likely to reciprocate low-intensity negative affect than is the case
in a marriage that is going to be unstable. This result was weak in terms of the size of the F ratio,
F(2,109) = 4.39, p = .038. This means that, by
and large, it is characteristic of all marriages,
even happy, stable ones, for people to reciprocate
most negativity, even high intensity negativity. In
happy and stable marriages husbands do de-escalate low intensity negativity, but wives do not,
and no one does so when the negativity escalates,
even in happy, stable marriages. This suggests
that, for the most part, there is not much of a
brake in most marriages once negativity begins. Istatements also have been characteristic of the

Journal of Marriage and the Family
therapeutic use of the active listening model. At
the outset of the complaint-validation sequence,
clients are admonished to state their complaints in
terms of what they want, instead of the partner's
failing. Wile (1995) wrote:
It is impossible to make "I-statements"when
you are in the "hating-my-partner,
wanting-revenge, feeling-stung-and-needing-to-sting-back"
stateof mind.At such a momentyou cannotrememberwhat an "I-statement"
is, and, frankly,
you do not care.(p. 2)
But this is precisely when therapists have suggested that making I-statements, being nondefensive, being empathetic, and paraphrasing one's
partnerare necessary. They are unnecessary when
things are going well.
The findings in these data suggest that negative affect reciprocity in kind, because it is so
characteristic of all marriages, may be something
that therapists can afford to ignore. It is not the
problem. The problem, our data suggest, is the escalation of negativity and only by the husband,
which we believe is an index of the husband's refusal to accept influence from his wife. We are
quite confident that this sequence indexes this
process. Our confidence comes from a detailed
observational analysis of transactions of power
and influence in a recent dissertation on violent
couples in our laboratory by Regina Rushe (1995)
and a subsequent analysis of the same sequence in
the same couples. We are, however, planning to
code this pattern of rejecting and accepting influence directly with a new observational coding
system, but the process will take several years to
complete.
If we assume that this sequence is, in fact, an
index of the refusal of some husbands to share
power with their wives by rejecting the demands
she makes, then the issue in therapy becomes not
one of getting the couple to apply the brake in the
face of negative affect reciprocity, but in getting
husbands to share power with their wives. Usually the wife brings marital issues to the table for
discussion, and she usually brings a detailed analysis of the conditions in which this problem occurs, its history, and suggestions for a solution.
Some men, those whose marriages wind up stable
and happy, accept influence from their wives, and
some do not. Most sociological analyses of marriage emphasize the loss of power that men have
experienced in the last 40 years with the loss of
the breadwinner role and with women's emergence in the workplace (e.g., Schwartz, 1994).

<-----Page 15----->Process Models of Marriage
Women not only work but tend to have careers as
meaningful to them as their husbands' careers, albeit they are earning a fraction of what men earn
for the same work. Our data suggest that only
newlywed men who accept influence from their
wives are winding up in happy and stable marriages.
We conducted exploratory analyses of the correlates of the husband's rejection of influence
from the wife. These analyses capitalize on
chance, and we need to be cautious about accepting these results. The preliminary results suggest
that the husband's rejection of influence from his
wife is unrelated to the husband's age, income,
occupation, or educational level. However, we
found that the husbands who are more likely to
reject influence from their wives are high on the
MMPI hostility subscale (which assesses suspicious hostility), are smokers, are more likely to
regularly use cocaine, were rated by observers as
dominating their wives in the discussion in our
oral history interview, make the major decisions
in the family, have suffered financial or emotional
hardships in the marriage, are physically shorter,
report being healthier, and are more physically
active in one-on-one competitive sports than men
who accept influence from their wives.
The data suggest that, though asymmetric,
gender roles during conflict resolution are a twoway street. Only newlywed women who are able
to soften their start-up of conflict wind up in
happy and stable marriages. The view recommends a model of marital therapy based on gentleness, on a softened start-up by the wife, on the
male's acceptance of influence, of de-escalation
of low intensity negativity by the male, high ratios of positivity to negativity, and the use of positive affect by both partnersto de-escalate conflict
and to physiologically soothe the male. Perhaps
these approaches to conflict represent a psychologically less costly approach than approaches
currently taught to distressed couples, and perhaps this less costly approach to conflict is less
likely to relapse after treatment.
We need to comment on the results of physiologically soothing the male in marriages that turn
out to be stable and happy. Although there is evidence for the Gottman-Levenson hypothesis,
there is also evidence that distressed marriages
and high levels of marital conflict are chronically
and diffusely physiologically
arousing for
women, as well as for men (Gottman, 1990;
Gottman & Levenson, 1992), that this arousal is
especially marked for women in battering mar-

19
riages (Jacobson, Gottman, Waltz, Rushe, & Babcock, 1994), and that this arousal is predictive of
the illness of women (Gottman, 1994). For both
newlywed men and women, marital conflict also
is associated with reduced serum prolactin and
higher levels of the stress-related hormones,
epinephrine, norepinephrine, ACTH, and growth
hormone, but not cortisol (Malarkey, KiecoltGlaser, Pearl, & Glaser, 1994), and associated
with the suppression of the immune system
(Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1993). Marital separation is
associated with even greater immuno-suppression
in women than in men (Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
1987, 1988). Also, Gottman (1994) reported that
a spouse's contempt was predictive of increased
infectious illness for women, but not for men. The
relationship between marital conflict and illness
for men, but not for women, was mediated
through loneliness. Marital conflict, peripheral
autonomic physiology, cardiovascular reactivity,
the endocrine system, the immune system, and illness all are associated in similar and different
ways for men and women, and the final assessment is not yet in. It is likely that the biological,
stress-related response of men is more rapid and
recovery is slower than that of women, and that
this response is related to the greater emotional
withdrawal of men than women in distressed families. Levenson, Carstensen, and Gottman (1994)
suggested that the general psychophysiological
finding of men's greater awareness of their cardiovascular physiology may imply that men are
more likely than women to look at their bodily
cues for signs of emotion, whereas women are
more likely than men to look at the social environment. Hence, men are more likely than women
to withdraw when aroused physiologically. However, it is likely that physiological soothing (by
self and partner) of both spouses will turn out to
be an important component of marital therapy.
Many prominent writers on marital therapy
have proposed ways of having the therapy do the
work of softening confrontation in marriages. For
example, Hendrix (1988) has suggested that marital hostility is actually the result of "childhood
wounds," and he speaks of training couples to
"develop an X-ray vision" that allows them to see
the wounds behind the hostility. This approach is
likely to help soften the partner's response to hostility when the therapist is present and can help
reframe a perceived attack as the result of an unresolved wound. Hendrix even has suggested that
one task of marriage is to heal childhood wounds.
This view is consistent with object relations theo-

<-----Page 16----->20
ry, which also sees marital hostility as primarily
the result of projective identification. Other marital therapies have provided similar mechanisms of
softening confrontation from within the therapy. Johnson and Greenberg's (1988) "emotionfocused" therapy, which is based on attachment
theory, views marital hostility as the result of an
"underlying" insecurity. The therapist helps the
couple reframe hostility in the context of what
they call the more "vulnerable" emotions. In this
way, anger and contempt are reframed as the result of an emotion that is probably easier for the
partner to be empathetic to, namely the spouse's
fear. In an examination of who profits most from
this therapy, Johnson and Greenberg suggested
that it is couples who are able to soften their complaints. In fact, the term "softening" for changing
the hardness of the confrontation should be attributed to them (p. 188). In a recent proposal of a
new integrative therapy, Jacobson and Christensen (1996) suggested an "acceptance" therapy
based on helping partners accept their spouses as
they are, instead of demanding change, although
they suggest that, paradoxically, acceptance is
also the basis for obtaining behavior change. The
therapy also includes a set of techniques for the
therapist to reduce direct confrontation by reframing the "harder"emotions (anger, hostility) as the
"softer" emotions (fear, sadness).
Thus, these therapies are, to some degree,
proposing mechanisms that appear to be aimed at
producing results similar to what the newlyweds
in this study who wound up in stable, happy marriages do. Some things may be hard to reprogram,
however. For example, it seems unlikely that couples will be able to follow an admonition to increase the amount of positive affect in the service
of de-escalation. Interest, humor, and affection
need to occur naturally, particularly in the context
of conflict resolution. The admonition to be funny
or to enjoy a partner's attempts at humor are
probably self-destructive mechanisms.
Of course, we need to raise again the caveat
that it is not logical that, to be effective, therapeutic interventions for ailing marriages need to be
based on an empirical analysis of what naturally
occurs in well-functioning marriages. There could
be two kinds of lawful relationships, one for marriages that function well and another for marriages that were ailing but then are repaired. We
do not think that this will turn out to be the case.
In our view, what is needed is an empirically
based theory of how positive processes are connected in marriages that are functioning well-

Journal of Marriage and the Family
how they are established and maintained. A potentially profitable avenue of investigation would
involve asking what is the etiology of the dysfunctional patterns predictive of divorce in these
data, such as the wife's negative start-up and the
husband's refusing to accept influence. We expect that the answers to both questions are found
in patterns of emotional engagement and responsiveness during everyday interaction. Negative
wife start-up may be an escalated complaint, and
it may be escalated because the lower intensity
complaint was previously ignored by her husband
in the nonconflict context. Hence, we predict that
engagement and responsiveness in neutral affective contexts and engagement and responsiveness
to both positive and negative affect in nonconflict
contexts will predict both the wife's negative hard
start-up and the husband's refusal to accept her
influence. To investigate this, we constructed an
apartment laboratory where couples lived for 24
hours (and were videotaped for 12 hours) and
were instructed to act as they normally would at
home. A subsample of 50 newlywed couples from
this study went through this procedure. Currently,
we are coding the 600 hours of videotape from
this part of the study to assess whether engagement and responsiveness during interactions in
these nonconflict contexts are related to the patterns of conflict resolution that we now have
identified.
If we are right, then the implications are that
marital therapy needs to do two things. First, it
needs to abandon the active listening model in
favor of a model of increased softening and gentleness in start-up, de-escalating, changing the
balance of power in favor of the husband's increased acceptance of influence from his wife,
and increasing physiological soothing (by self and
partner). Second, it also may need to find ways of
working with the couple's patterns of emotional
engagement and responsiveness in contexts other
than conflict resolution, as well as changing the
way couples resolve disagreements, which appears to be the sole preoccupation of all extant
marital therapies.
