Comparison of external technology providers to
Siemens uncovers five drivers of innovation success.

OVERVIEW: Although innovation outsourcing has become a widespread practice in R&D management, managers on the ground wonder which project management
practices are required for technology development with
external providers. An examination of 24 outsourced development projects at Siemens identified five common
drivers of success. Among these, project-specific partner
competence as well as maintaining in-house competence
distinguish successes from failures. In addition, each innovation source has specific success drivers. These include managing expectations (customers tend to get
carried away thinking they can sell the technology next
month) and protecting one's intellectual property in collaborations with competitors and start-ups. When a
mature rather than novel technology is outsourced, the
success drivers shift from project issues to producibility
and system compatibility.
KEY CONCEPTS: innovation outsourcing, partnerships, project management, Siemens.
There is a continuing trend toward shifting product
and service innovation activities outside the firm, a trend
that is driven by a combination of more complex technologies (and greater technology risk), global markets,
more dispersed expertise, and faster emergence of disZhijian Cui is a Ph.D. candidate in technology management at INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France. His research

ruptive technologies (1,2). One survey of the world's
largest R&D spenders reveals an increasing reliance
upon extemal sources of technology over the last ten
years (5); another recent survey estimates that 45 percent of innovations stem from external sources, with this
figure as high as 90 percent in service industries (4).
Despite this, managers still struggle with identifying the
best innovation providers and with managing collaborations. Indeed, many collaboration projects eventually
unravel (4). This article presents a study of 24 detailed
innovation outsourcing case studies at Siemens, a global
electronics company with one of the world's largest and
most international R&D operations. This study makes
two contributions:
1. We compare five different types of external providers
of novel technologies with respect not only to their
general strengths and weaknesses but also to their operational management challenges: research institutes (including universities), suppliers, competitors, customers,
and technology start-up companies. This offers lessons
for R&D managers on how to choose among the various
provider types and where to focus attention in managing
collaboration projects.

<-----Page 1----->2. We compare the outsourcing of novel versus mature
technologies for one type of provider (suppliers) and demonstrate how, in the latter case, management challenges are
less concerned with competence and more with the compatibility of a sourced new component within the broader
system of which the component will become a part.
How the Study Was Conducted
Siemens AG is Germany's largest manufacturer and
R&D organization. In fiscal 2007, its gross revenue was
about €72.4 billion and total R&D expenditures were
€3.4 billion. The company had 32,500 A&D employees
globally, filed 5,060 patent applications and registered
8,267 internal inventions. Its R&D themes are highly diversified, ranging from environmental technology, new
energy sources, artificial intelligence, new light sources,
and new materials for such applications as transportation systems, factory design and logistics.
Siemens complements its vast in-house R&D efforts by
collaborating with hundreds of external innovation partners. For this study, 24 innovation outsourcing cases
were systematically selected along two dimensions (see
Table 1): 1) comparing innovation sources for the embryonic technology phase, and 2) comparing the management challenges across technology maturity stages
for one source (5,6).
The unit of analysis is a single collaborative project of
outsourced innovation activity. The Siemens collaborators were willing to share with us their experiences on
"successful" and "less successful" projects. The comparison between successful and less successfial efforts makes
the study more reliable by decreasing the likelihood of
idiosyncratic findings (7). Each case is based on a twohour interview using structured questions plus supporting
materials; the interviewees were project managers, senior
engineers, or innovation portfolio managers. A few cases
were reported together, two per interviewee, and a number of cases involved several interviewees.

The case examples come from nine different European
entities of Siemens. Because of limited access to some of
the Siemens units, there are cells in the matrix of Table 1
for which data were unavailable. The cross-source comparison is therefore focused on the embryonic phase while
the comparison across the life-cycle phase is focused on
the supplier source. Note that suppliers are involved in
the entire technology life cycle, whereas other sources
(e.g., universities) are clustered in the embryonic stage.
Table 2 summarizes the success drivers for embryonic
technologies across innovation sources. Important commonalities and differences suggest where innovation
managers need to focus attention. We shall discuss each
factor in turn.
Common Success Drivers for
Outsourcing Embryonic Technologies
Trust and communication
Working with a partner requires a high degree of mutual
understanding and trust (8,9). Trust builds on existing
relationships from previous collaboration and also requires an investment in communication and transparency. In our sample cases, this investment took the form of
frequent meetings and visits with all partners, and an
open atmosphere for discussion.
For example, Siemens staff spent a lot of time communicating with faculty of university partners: "Many informal meetings were organized as things came up, and
formal meetings were organized once per month," one
staff member told us. "Do not collaborate with organizations that you do not know very well and where there is
no mutual interest in continuing to collaborate for a long
time," said another.
Communication and trust are more easily built when
the partner is geographically close. Indeed, in the one
less-successful customer collaboration, the partner was

the Siemens unit. Geographical distance always represents a complication for a project team, but it can be
addressed by using a cross-firm, co-located team and by
strong relationships and frequent communication.
One successful customer innovation project had a history of collaboration since the 1960s even though the
customer was in East Asia. The Siemens unit sent a
team of engineers to support installation of the partner's facility, and senior managers on both sides became friends.
Actions speak louder than words when building trust. In a
nutshell, keep your word! There were several situations in
which Siemens promised to make additional investments
to support next-generation equipment but then canceled
because of corporate pressure fi'om outside the project
(e.g., because "the business unit canceled the offer" or
"the plan finally wasn't approved by the investment committee"). Such reneging on promises made continued trust
unlikely and consequently reduced the partner's commitment and willingness to take fiirther steps.
Strong project-related partner competence
Competence is a common prerequisite for all innovation
outsourcing, but the nature of the key competence differs by source. For universities and start-ups, the key
competences are new technology, breakthrough ideas,
and general theory frameworks. However, the competence must be related to the project at hand. For example,
in one project, the university's equipment could not produce the same material-grade prototypes as Siemens's
in-house models: "One of the key disagreements between us is that what she delivered can't be reproduced
in our lab," an interviewee told us. "We need a five-inch
setting, but she has only a three-inch setting in her lab."
In contrast, the lab environment in another project was

compatible with Siemens's, and the Ph.D. students at the
partner university received sufficient training before the
collaboration started.
With suppliers, Siemens usually cares about component
technology expertise in the relevant field. This helps to
reduce technical uncertainty and shorten development
time.
With customers, the key project-related competence is
their market knowledge. For example, one partnering
customer owned large-scale production facilities in which
Siemens's technology would be applied. In contrast, another customer partner in the same industry did not have
a large-scale plant; this caused the collaboration to lose
direction and cease after six years.
Verifying the competence of a prospective outsourcing
partner is an essential initial step in an outsourcing project. The checklist should include not only past evidence
of competence but also organizational stability (to be
discussed shortly) and culture match.

<-----Page 3----->In-house competence
Maintaining a minimal level of in-house competence
is necessary if the organization is to effectively apply
the ideas that come from the partner (this ability is
sometimes called "absorptive capacity"). In-house,
competence also helps to define questions in a fuzzy

and uncertain context, and it helps to solve unexpected
technical problems that inevitably emerge under conditions of uncertainty.
In all successful university collaborations, Siemens explicitly retained significant knowledge and activities inhouse. In one less successful project, the company did

Insights from Previous Work
Previous studies of innovation outsourcing have identified six key motivations for obtaining new technologies from
the outside {¡,11); 1) to lower R&D costs; 2) to access a market that the firm does not understand well; 3) to obtain
technology knowledge that does not exist within the firm; 4) to obtain robust component technologies with lower
manufacturing cost or higher quality; 5) to focus for strategic purposes on core competence and 6) to avoid internal
bureaucracy and politics {12) or to upgrade the firm's internal R&D processes.
Technology is known to evolve from an embryonic or novel phase to a mature phase (75). In this framework,
novel technology tends to offer product innovation and novel markets, and it is characterized by high technical and
market uncertainties. Mature technology, on the other hand, tends to offer additional features of existing products
and process innovation for established products {14,15).
The six innovation outsourcing motivations apply differendy to the five most widely discussed innovation sources:
universities and R&D institutes, customers, suppliers, competitors, and start-up companies. Additional external
innovation providers are emerging, such as idea brokers (e.g., the Internet marketplace Innocentive), "developers
for hire" (e.g., "rent-a-coder"), and professional design firms (e.g., IDEO). We focus on the five established providers because they are still the most relevant for our host organization.
Previous studies have examined general strengths and weaknesses of the five types of innovation providers, relating
these characteristics to the outsourcing motive and technology maturity stage for which they are best suited. For example, university outsourcing is observed mainly at the embryonic stage of innovation. Its role is to generate novel
ideas and to offer theory and general-purpose equipment; its strength lies in its diversified knowledge and potentially
low R&D cost. Provider strengths and weaknesses, as identified in previous work, are summarized in Table 3. Cost
continues to be important for all sources, although it is a less dominant concern than it was ten years ago.

These strengths and weaknesses are useful guidelines for the manager initiating a collaboration with an external
innovation provider. However, the observations summarized here are at a high level of aggregation, and it is not the
purpose of our study to re-examine them. Instead, this paper sheds light on the execution challenges of actually
managing an innovation outsourcing partner.—Ttie Autiiors

<-----Page 4----->not have sufficient in-house competence, failed to identify emerging problems, and lost control of both budget
and progress. One manager commented: "Who knows
when this project will end? Five years ago, we needed
five years and today we still need five years."
In supplier collaborations, strong in-house R&D competence is useful in identifying and overcoming potential
technical barriers. For example, when the first prototype
did not work in one electronic hardware project, Siemens's in-house R&D engineering team quickly diagnosed the problem and, ultimately, the product was
launched on time.
A paradox is inherent in these observations: We argue
for in-house competence when the company is outsourcing a new technology or intellectual property
(IP) precisely because the company does not have
sufficient competence in this technology. However,
our interviews suggest that it is helpful to have some
knowledge that is at least related. An absence of expertise makes it difficult for the innovation buyer to
absorb and apply the knowledge acquired. Outsourcing projects in which the company has no expertise,
not even in related fields, is "extremely risky," as one
interviewee put it.
The in-house competence may be based on preliminary
research, knowledge in related fields, or knowledge
about the system into which the new technology will be
integrated. Having at least related knowledge gives Siemens the ability to absorb, test and apply the purchased
IP, and this puts it in the position of an "essential" partner in the collaboration.
The only kind of source for which in-house competence
did not appear as a requirement was start-ups that offered
radically new technologies outside Siemens's normal
range. Because no in-house competence existed for those
cases we had access to, competence could not appear as
a differentiator. The absence of in-house competence certainly made these projects risky for Siemens {10).
Clear problem definition
In an environment characterized by high uncertainty, it
is difficult to anticipate which problems the project
team will need to solve. Nevertheless, targets for delivery time (and cost) must be set in collaboration with
the external partner. Clearly defined targets—such as
"decrease energy consumption by 30 percent" or "increase storage capacity by 70 percent"—reduce the
potential for disagreement, bundle responses to unexpected events, focus problem solving, and facilitate
termination decisions. However, targets may need adjustment in response to such unforeseeable events as
unexpected system interactions or the emerging of
competing technologies.

In order to better set targets and milestones, an organization must devote considerable time to negotiating the
contract, which requires thinking through and planning
the project and its benefits in great detail. With one project, for example, senior management spent two months
discussing the contract details before the project started.
The contract defined the project goal: "reduce the energy
consumption by 'x' [percent] compared with the traditional equipment." This helped in setting performance
hurdles and benchmarking progress.
Moreover, understanding the main source of any uncertainty helps Siemens to assign a project team that meshes with the partner's strengths and weaknesses and also
to set an appropriate target. For example, the principal
uncertainty in one university project stemmed from ambiguous market requirements. Universities were invited
to participate mainly to help obtain financial government
support and to change the project's image in the minds
of customers.
In collaborations with customers, project targets are codecided and shared between Siemens and the partner.
For example, all technical targets must be discussed in
great detail with all the partners and then spelled out
clearly in a project handbook. In one successful project,
the goal was clearly defined as "to develop a facility that
can utilize broader energy sources and decrease energy
consumption compared with a conventional facility."
The benchmark was Siemens's eurrent technology, and
progress was reviewed regularly.
As for outsourcing R&D activities to a competitor, one
of the interviewees remarked: "It is very hard to build
trust with competitors, and there are always confiicting
interests in the team." This makes it even more important
to make the strategic goal of the innovation outsourcing
explicit and well understood. In this project, Siemens's
goal was to obtain aecess to the competitor's know-how,
while the competitor's goal was to obtain access to
Siemens's market volume. Because this eompetitor was
small, the strategic importance of learning state-of-theart technology outweighed the risk of market loss.

Collaborations with start-ups are, once again, the exception because in our sample they were used mainly to explore radically novel opportunities. In such cases, precise
outcomes could not be defined at the outset and had yet
to emerge.
Aligning incentives and mitigating confiicts of interest
Misaligned incentives are always a threat when outsourcing innovation. In particular, any university collaboration faced three conflicts of interest:
t. A university partner tends to have strong demands for
intellectual property rights. One collaboration collapsed
simply because of ÍP conflicts, not because of incompetence or technology problems.
2. The requirements of publication and production are
very different. Researchers like to change parameters
and tests for the purpose of publication, and they tend to
shun tedious replication. Production, however, requires
reproducibility. Consequently, the commercial project
manager cares only about a small range of feasible parameters but demands utter reliability in the results.

innovation providers. However, outsourcing partners are
not all alike; there are important differences in the success drivers for each type of provider that require specific management attention (see column 3 of Table 2). In
this section we explain these factors in more detail.

3. There is tension between the university culture of relatively free exploration and the highly structured processes and systems within a large firm such as Siemens.

Our interviewees initially confirmed the strength of
universities as innovation sources: strong technology
know-how (albeit often at a general level and not application-specific) and relatively low cost. Two additional
success drivers emerged that should be addressed
by management: control of progress and transfer of
knowledge.

Such conflicts were handled at Siemens by mediators
who understood both sides. In one project, for example,
the Siemens project manager had a Ph.D. from the partnering university. As a result, he understood how the university lab and its doctoral students were managed, which
helped to mitigate conflicts and enabled project success.
The alignment of incentives requires patience and managerial skills. The mediators must first understand the
partners' real differences and then keep their egos under
control; when a difference arises, it can easily spiral into
an issue of "who wins?" As one interviewee explained:
"1 and my partner always have different opinions . . . but
we still need to figure out a common way to proceed. All
conflicts between us and the partner must be solved in a
mature business manner."
Solving conflicts constructively in this way contributes
to building relationships as a collaboration is repeated
over time. This is illustrated by the supplier sample, the
only category of outsourcing providers in which conflicts of interest did not emerge as a differentiator between successful and less successful projects. Because
all suppliers had previously collaborated with their associated units at Siemens, the parties had learned to
work through and resolve conflicts.

Drivers for Embryonic Technologies

November—December 2009

Universities and R&D institutes

Close control of progress.—University partners are highly innovative and generally possess strong expertise.
However, the university management system and "mindset" is quite different from those of the firm. As a result,
the university may work in directions and toward ends
with which the company disagrees. Avoiding such conflicts requires well-defined progress and cost milestones.
In one project, the university partner actually showed a
new product to Siemens customers before it was launched
in the market, which obviously put Siemens in an awkward position. Losing control of progress might also lead
to cost overruns. As one interviewee commented: "Because we didn't know what she was doing, we couldn't
stop her work; . . . , it is quite normal to see that the actual expense is 50 percent higher than intended."
Progress toward each milestone should be reviewed in
weekly or monthly project meetings that include all team
members. Geographically distant partners need at least
some regular face-to-face contact, complemented by
frequent teleconferences.
Transfer of in-house knowledge to the university.—The
expertise of universities and R&D institutes is usually
quite general ("the partner knew a lot about this catalyst
in many circumstances, but not in this environment
and this performance challenge"). Universities need to

<-----Page 6----->acquire substantial "local knowledge" in order to understand what has already been done on a specific project
and what still needs to be accomplished; otherwise, unnecessary replication will occur. In one project, a Ph.D.
student worked for three years merely to duplicate knowledge that Siemens already possessed in-house.
Clearly, the university partner must not only understand
what to achieve but also what to leave aside. One way to
facilitate knowledge transfer is to organize in-house
training with an "apprenticeship" program. In successful
projects, Ph.D. students were usually given two to three
months of in-house training before the projects formally
began. This ensured an effective knowledge transfer
from the company to the university.

ment or project management can inñuence both the
financial commitment and the expectations of collaboration. For example, after the customer CEO changed during a project to develop a new industrial equipment
technology, "the atmosphere of the steering committee
completely changed." This customer's new managers
didn't like the project and were more concerned ahout
short-run payoffs than a long-run technology breakthrough. In contrast, when top management of another
industrial equipment customer had remained stable for a
long time, the Siemens manager saw this as a key reason
for the continuing financial and technical support from
this client over a span of 20 years.

Suppliers
Customers
Customers were found to be useful in providing ideas
and in carrying out development activities. They understand market needs very well from the user side, and
sophisticated customers also understand trends and future needs. We identified two specific success drivers for
customer collaboration: well-managed customer expectations, and the partner's management stability.
Management of customer expectations.—Although customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance, overly
optimistic customers are a source of risk in radical innovation projects with high uncertainty. The project
manager needs to understand how the customer may interpret signals about the project's potential. As one interviewee stated: "Once your customers are aware of your
new product, there is no way you can stop it." The manager needs to find a balance between informing customers of the risks and convincing customers of the
continuing potential. In one project, for example, the
business unit was very frank in informing the customer
what could and could not be achieved. This helped the
Siemens unit to ensure that its own component supplier
and the partner customer worked at the same speed.
It is important to build customer confidence in order to
maintain project momentum. In the face of significant
risks, the project manager needs to send positive signals about project progress, market demand, and new
knowledge learned from the project. This is especially
important for projects initiated by customers. For example, after a customer innovation partner on one project changed its top manager, Siemens was unable to
convince the new manager of this technology's promise from either a market or technical perspective. The
customer reduced the budget as a result, and the project
was delayed and ultimately reduced in scope.
Stable customer organization and management.—Four
ofthe five customer collaboration projects were initiated
by the customers. However, a change of top manage-

Years of competitive selection have turned suppliers into
strong component specialists, with effective development processes of their own and who can contribute useful (though rarely breakthrough) ideas and activities.
Three success drivers were especially important for this
innovation source: detailed monitoring, well-defined
milestones, and knowledge transfer.
Detailed process control and monitoring.—Although
suppliers are typically familiar with Siemens's needs
and systems, the uncertainty inherent in new technologies and emerging market needs usually precludes effective delegation of risk management to the supplier. In
one project, Siemens let the supplier run industrial testing after the prototype was frozen and before mass production started. This should have been a low-risk stage
as compared with prototype development, but because
the technology was embryonic, operating parameter
variations remained substantial enough to disrupt industrial functionality. Siemens's oversight was insufficient;
the supplier did not fiiUy report adverse data, and then
the Siemens employee responsible for the oversight quit
just after testing was completed. Thus, the problem remained undetected until the market launch was imminent. Remanufacturing and retesting took 18 months,
which ultimately led to project failure.
Clearly defined contract milestones.—All three supplier
collaboration projects involved formal contracts that
addressed such complex issues as problem definition,
targets, milestones, and IP policy. Siemens's investment
and order-quantity commitment was contingent upon
project progress. Such contingent contracts allow the
firm to hedge against technology uncertainties and give
the partner incentives to "invest" in the project. Clear
milestones must be defined to enable contingent contracts. For example, clearly described target prototype
specifications for one project allowed problems to be
diagnosed immediately and then addressed and solved.
Less successful projects had a common feature: the
team would not give up on the technology even after
Research • Technology Management |

<-----Page 7----->missing several milestones. The decision to terminate a
project should be based not only on its financial status
but also on changes in the competitive environment, the
project's strategic importance, and its position in the
overall R&D portfolio.
Knowledge transfer from R&D to manufacturing.—
Supplier collaboration is tightly interwoven with Siemens's in-house production. In-house manufacturing
engineers are not familiar with the producibiiity of components that incorporate novel technologies. This makes
knowledge transfer between R&D and manufacturing
crucial. The knowledge should include novel design
attributes, potential production pitfalls, and the ideal
assembly sequence. In the case of the less successful
supplier outsourcing, manufacturing engineers joined
the development team too late, and the internal production group was unable to resolve production prototype
problems. As a result, the production costs were too high
and the volume sold was too low.
Competitors
Strong competitors had valuable expertise to offer—but
at the risk of weakening Siemens's own competitive position. This made one success driver critical: IP protection.
Protection of IP.—Competition for intellectual property
is inherent in outsourcing innovation to competitors. If
the IP retained is not sufficiently strong, the competitor
can possibly block the firm's product and future development. In one project, for example, the competitor had
complete IP ownership of the innovation output. Siemens was free to apply the innovation in-house but could
neither sell nor license it. Thus, the business unit concluded that the benefit from this collaboration was too
small to compensate for the risk of technology leakage
and the collaboration was terminated.
One systematic way of protecting IP in a competitor collaboration project is a "collaborative platform" in which
all joint projects are organized around identified themes
and products/technologies within this platform, keeping
other technologies out.
Start-up companies
Siemens outsourced innovation activities to start-ups
mainly for seizing "promising and potentially disruptive
technologies." Start-ups used fast and fiexible processes
to work on novel ideas that were too risky for the large
organization to pursue. Four different success drivers
emerged for working with such organizations, as follows:
1. Protection of IP and core technologies.—Start-ups
can become competitors themselves; consequently, if the
November—December 2009

intellectual property is lost the collaboration becomes
meaningless. In the past, several start-ups had evolved
into competitors of Siemens, as did the start-up in the
less successful collaboration. One interviewee remarked:
"A start-up can sell the IP to competitors or produce it
itself; either [action] blocks us." Thus, IP protection is as
important with start-ups as with competitor sourcing.
Firms can protect their intellectual property by clearly defining their IP-sharing policy in the contract. Technologies of great importance for firms need to be exclusively
owned, and any resale should require the firm's permission. For example, Siemens financed (with 100 percent
funding) a start-up to develop a new material that was to
be owned entirely by Siemens. This arrangement decreased potential IP ownership friction and protected
Siemens's strategic advantage.
2. Flexible decision making and management systems.—
Start-up companies normally have faster and less formal
decision-making processes than large companies. This is
an advantage, and some projects are outsourced to startups precisely because "this project looks promising in a
start-up but would be killed internally by politics. . . .
Therefore, we'd rather let it be outside." However, reaping the benefits of such an arrangement requires the large
company to adjust. In this case, Siemens's investment
decision processes had longer cycles, which required
special arrangements to make the collaboration succeed:
"We have a special budget and a different mindset from
other divisions. We respond to their requests very fast."
3. Active, not passive, participation.—In its relationships
with some start-up companies, Siemens focused on its
role as an investor without taking an active management
role. This policy is beneficial because it diversifies technology risks, alerts the company to new technologies,
and earns a financial return. But diversification benefits
are limited when the interests of the start-up confiict
with those of Siemens. For example, a Siemens employee was on the board of a start-up that undertook a project
relevant to Siemens. When another firm offered a better

<-----Page 8----->buy-in price than Siemens, this employee was legally
unable to vote for Siemens. As the technology successfully evolved toward competing with Siemens's own
product, Siemens sold its shares because "we couldn't
control it and the shares fetched a good price." Of course,
you do not always have the privilege of sitting on the
board of your start-up partner (although you should try!).
However, this example holds a more general lesson:
Fully benefiting from start-up collaboration may require
some input on steering its R&D activities. Therefore,
use whatever leverage you have in a partner's decisionmaking; do not squander it because of unrelated or "general policy" reasons.
4. Dependence on individuals,—The most difficult challenge in working with start-ups is dependence on individual employees. "Start-ups don't have a credible track
record," said one interviewee. The start-up's technologies or patents are "frozen in individual employees"; if
something happens to this small group or if it leaves, the
whole company may die or lose its value to Siemens.
Therefore, stability of the start-up's organization is extremely important for the success of innovation outsourcing, and it needs to be monitored and supported. In one
successful project, the head of the start-up was both general manager and chief engineer. The contract contained
the provision that, in the event something happened to
him, Siemens could take possession of all design blueprints. This approach is attractive for the firm but undesirable for the start-up, so it is not commonly used.

ing. This delayed the project and increased costs by
50 percent.
Component compatibility with system architecture
A component might work very well in isolation but fail
when working within a large system. For instance, one
project partner was a leading manufacturer of electronic
processors, but problems emerged when the processor
was embedded in the Siemens system. In the end, Siemens had to find a different provider and the project was
delayed by three months. Compatibility must be verified
at the outset.
Supplier flexibility on component adjustments

This section summarizes observations about outsourcing the development of a mature (as opposed to embryonic) technology to a supplier. There are, of course,
several commonalities (e.g., supplier competence), and
communication and trust remain as important as ever.
However, an outsourced mature technology is usually
not managed as a "stand-alone" project but rather is embedded in an existing, larger system. This places a different emphasis on knowledge transfer and puts two
additional demands on the supplier: compatibility of
components with the existing system architecture; and
flexibility, or a willingness to adjust components to accommodate broader system requirements.

Siemens's motivation for outsourcing a mature technology is to find market-ready components that can be
quickly and inexpensively embedded in a system (existing or under development). All the suppliers in our
sample had strong relevant expertise, but not all were
willing to adjust their components (some renowned
suppliers tended to be "stubborn"). For example, one
supplier, a leading sensor manufacturer, was willing to
incur the additional cost of adjusting its components to
the Siemens system. In contrast, another well-known
supplier was over-confident about its product and refused to adjust even when a third-party report had documented problems stemming from this component. In
the end, the product's market launch was delayed by
half a year.

Knowledge transfer andproducibility

Lessons and Conciusion

As with the case of embryonic technologies, the transfer
of knowledge from R&D to manufacturing is important.
Note that the less uncertainty involved with a mature
technology makes it easy to underestimate the difficulty
of transferring R&D knowledge into manufacturing. In
one case, components developed by one supplier could
not initially be produced at the Siemens plant and required unforeseen extra process development and train-

Previous studies of innovation outsourcing have identified strengths and weaknesses but at a relatively abstract
level. This study, in contrast, has focused on operational
managerial challenges for each source of innovation:
our comparison of successful and less successful outsourcing projects allows us to identify speciflc success
drivers that managers should utilize or monitor (see
Table 2).

Outsourcing Mature Technologies to Suppliers

<-----Page 9----->The success drivers allow managers to configure an outsourcing collaboration, choosing the right partners (e.g.,
the source type with the appropriate strengths, and the
specific partner with the right competence and stability)
and putting the right incentives and milestones in place
(e.g., goal definition and IP ownership) while focusing
attention on the most critieal issues in managing the collaboration (setting control procedures, knowledge transfer activities, and decision procedures).
The insights from this study also help to define roles in
complex projects with multiple outsoureing partners.
For example, one project manager eommented: "We let
the partner customer give us guidance on what to do, and
the partner university gives us general knowledge and
does the testing." In another project, a multi-party outsourcing team was formed that included a eompetitor, a
start-up and suppliers. Consequently, management challenges include ensuring tight IP protection, allowing
"start-up cowboys" to work closely with corporate R&D
staff, and facilitating cooperation between in-house engineers and suppliers so that knowledge is transferred
effeetively. The relative strengths and contributions of
the partners must be defined, and the challenges and
risks for each partner should be managed during the exeeution of the collaborative project.
Because Siemens is a global and diverse R&D company,
our lessons may (with appropriate cautions) be applicable to other organizations as well. The common Siemens
R&D decision process across our sample should reduce
"noise" in the observations. However, this commonality
also limits applicability of our results to other organizations. For instance, Siemens's highly developed managerial accounting methods may make "project control" a
given in our sample, preventing it from appearing as a
success driver; in other organizations with less developed accounting methods, "projeet control" may well be
a distinct success driver.
Some of our results may carry over to other industries,
such as the pharmaeeutical industry, which also outsources large chunks of technology and innovation work
to external providers. For this purpose, however, our
results should be viewed as "starting hypotheses" from
which a company can build its own specific experiences.
For example: some providers are biotech companies but
not start-ups; and the project governance and management methods that distinguish success from failure may

be affected by such industry-specific effects as regulatory influences, the availability of predietive models,
and/or three-way communication among the provider,
the company and opinion leaders. Our study offers hypotheses and a way of thinking about the problem, but
the specific operational success drivers discussed here
are not necessarily transferable.
This caution is related to a general principle of benehmarking efforts: Always take what others do with a grain
of salt, and always adapt what they do to your own specific organizational characteristics and needs. The same
holds true here. ®
