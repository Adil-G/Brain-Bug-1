Equity capital fuels growth companies and yields high returns for investors. The process of
equity investment and ultimate harvesting of innovative companies has created significant
wealth among fund investors, venture capitalists, angels and new entrepreneurs. Extensive
research investigates all phases of the venture capital investment process, industry
characteristics and returns to investors. Surprisingly absent from current research are
studies including women, on both the supply (equity provider) and demand (equity seeker)
sides. Women make significant contributions to the US economy in the workforce and as
business owners, yet research about women as recipients of equity capital and providers of
equity is extremely scarce. This raises a question—are women being left out of the wealth
creation process? Our paper addresses this question by exploring women’s role in supply
and demand of equity capital. We utilize a social capital perspective to develop a conceptual
framework and focus our analysis on early stage and angel investment. The paper concludes
with directions for future research.

Introduction
The role of equity-backed companies as the engines for economic growth
has gained significant attention over the past decade (Mason and Harrison
1999). As such, public policy interest in the expansion of venture capital
and angel activity has become a global concern (Mason and Harrrison 1999,

Bygrave et al. 2001a). Equity capital facilitates the growth of new
industries, fosters the development and diffusion of new innovations and
contributes to a robust economy (Timmons and Bygrave 1997, Mason and
Harrison 1999, Bygrave et al., 2001b). One of the most important results of
equity investment in fast-growing companies is the wealth created for
entrepreneurs, angel investors and venture capitalists. Since 1995, investors
reaped record returns, a new crop of entrepreneurial multi-millionaires
gained prominence and venture capitalists became personally wealthy as
companies were acquired, went public or achieved supernormal returns
(Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). According to one source, the
percentage of millionaires in the US population tripled over the last decade,
with more than 75% of those on the Forbes 400 Richest People list being selfmade and having at least a billion dollars each (Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson, 2000). The greatest returns are created at the end of the funding
cycle when a harvest or liquidity event takes place (Wright and Robbie
1998, Bhide 2000).
Before fast-growth companies receive venture capital they typically
acquire financing from a variety of diversified sources, including private
venture capital partnerships, partnerships affiliated with financial corporations and investment banks, corporations, corporate venturing programs,
SBICs, individuals and direct investments from banks and financial
corporations (Thompson Financial Services Data 1999). However, most
often the early phases of venture start-up and growth are financed by
family, friends, bootstrapping and private equity sources, or business
angels – high-net-worth individuals who make private investments (Mason
and Harrison 1999; Brophy 1997). Successful acquisition of angel financing
can be a crucial to a fast-growth venture’s survival, and to ultimate receipt
of institutional venture capital (Freear and Wetzel 1992). As with the
venture capital industry, there is evidence that investment by angels has
expanded since 1994 (Freear et al. 1997). It was estimated that during the
peak of the venture capital industry, high-net-worth individuals (angels)
invested $US20 – 30 billion in early stage ventures (Center for Venture
Research 2001).
Research on equity financing can be classified into supply-side and
demand-side perspectives and includes research on both angel and
institutional venture capital. A significant proportion of studies examine
the supply side – the industry, investors, returns to investors, venture
capital firms, venture firm strategies and the relationship between investors
and entrepreneurial ventures (Fried and Hisrich 1988, Timmons and
Sapienza 1992, Timmons and Bygrave 1997, Mason and Harrison 1999,
Greene et al. 2001). Less, but more recent research, explores the demand
side of capital-seeking ventures and the effects of venture capital on new
venture performance (Manigart et al. 2000, Cassar 2001, Zacharakis 2001).
Although angel financing is pervasive and important to growing ventures,
angels and private investors are hard to identify, elusive and often prefer to
remain invisible, therefore research about angel financing is comparatively
sparse (Mason and Harrison 1999).
Similarly absent from the research are studies that focus on, include or
compare women capital providers or entrepreneurs. In a recent review,

<-----Page 2----->SOCIAL CAPITAL AND GENDER, FINANCE AND FIRMS

307

only one study was identified that considered women entrepreneurs
(Greene et al. 2001). This gap is highly relevant and important because
consideration of only a single population of entrepreneurs and equity
providers (men) will result in theory development, prescriptions and
explanations that may not be fully generalizable. Women make significant
contributions in the entrepreneurial arena. It is estimated that they own 6.2
million US businesses, or 38% of all firms, employ 9.2 million workers and
generate $US1.5 trillion in sales (Center for Women’s Business Research
2002). This is just a small part of women’s contributions to the US
economy in general. Women over 15 years of age account for 61% of all
labour force participants and a rising number serve in managerial and
leadership positions (US Census 2001; The Fact Sheet 2000). These facts,
in concert with the growing body of research on equity investments in
general, strong public policy interest and dynamic growth raise the
question: ‘Are women entrepreneurs and equity providers being left out of
the wealth creation process in the US?’.
This paper addresses this question by exploring women’s role in supply
and demand of equity capital. We begin by developing a conceptual
framework that draws from a social capital perspective and provides a basis
for our exploratory analysis.
Background and literature review
To guide our inquiry, we adapted a framework presented by Greene et al.
(2001) that was created from a review of the literature on venture capital
and women’s entrepreneurship, and included both supply and demand
aspects of venture capital. Consideration of both supply and demand
aspects of an entrepreneurial phenomenon is consistent with a long lineage
of research (Thornton 1999). For this discussion, we are interested in
women’s participation on both the supply and demand sides, where the
‘deal’ is the expected outcome for both parties (see figure 1). A relevant
approach for considering how the relationship between the capital supplier
and capital seeker come together is a social capital perspective. Social
capital is viewed as a key facilitator of resource exchanges (particularly
knowledge) within and between firms, and therefore can be an important
catalyst of value creation (Aldrich 1999, Maula et al. 2001).
A social capital approach suggests that non-economic knowledge
emerges from norms, networks and social relationships and that all of
these have the potential to become important resources for new ventures
(Coleman 1988, Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). Social networks provide
conduits for information exchange and mediate resource exchanges that can
affect the success of a new venture. Information benefits can arise in three
ways: timing, access and referrals (Burt 1992). In particular, social
networks can facilitate efficient access to financial capital and prove
effective in tapping into the professional direction and support offered by
venture capital firms (Aldrich 1989). On the supply side, the venture
capital industry is described as a closed network, geographically concentrated and tightly interconnected (Bygrave 1992, Alimansky 2000,

BenDaniel et al. 2000). Success of the VC firms is dependent on what they
know and who they know – where tight interconnectedness leads to better
information increasing the firm’s legitimacy. It is widely known that the
core of a venture capital firm’s livelihood is deal flow, which firms learn
about through their contact networks in other firms (Bygrave 1992). These
relationships yield social capital that the venture capital firms can expend in
executing deals.
On the demand side, the presence or absence of social ties, such as
access to or membership in associations, plays a key role in successful
acquisition of equity. In particular, Steier and Greenwood (1995) suggest
that indeed the social legitimacy may be valued over the technological
contribution of a deal in attracting venture capital financing. For a new
venture seeking capital, a fundamental aspect of social capital resides within
the top management team, their social relationships, the size of their
networks and the diversity of their social ties (Aldrich 1989). The types of
personal relationships developed through interaction are based on trust and
truthfulness, as well as cognitive dimensions, or the extent to which shared
representations and norms are present between parties (Granovetter 1985,
Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). Like the VC firm, the entrepreneurial firm
can expend earned social capital in accessing and executing the ‘deal’.
The ‘deal’ is negotiated within a social context where certain factors can
facilitate the relationship or become barriers to the relationship (see figure
1). Facilitators might be in the form of brokers who can facilitate links
between persons who are not directly connected, or who might screen
contacts for entrepreneurs and help them to obtain more timely

<-----Page 4----->SOCIAL CAPITAL AND GENDER, FINANCE AND FIRMS

309

information (Aldrich 1999). On the other hand, structural barriers to the
deal may exist within the context. For instance norms of the equity
provider and seeker might not be congruent. In the case of women
entrepreneurs, the venture capital industry is concentrated and operates on
traditional male practices (Bygrave 1992). Women seeking equity might be
perceived as having different values, goals or behaviours than their male
counterparts, creating a view that they are ‘riskier investments’ (Brophy
1997, Greene et al. 2001). In this case, the perceptions would be a barrier to
the successful completion of an equity investment deal, by slowing or
completely stalling the process.
Empirical studies about the supply side of the equation have
emphasized the venture capitalist’s investment process, strategy and
relationship of the equity provider to the venture-backed firm (Fried and
Hisrich 1988, Timmons and Sapienza 1992). The decision process of
venture capitalists has been explored in some studies (Hisrich and
Jankowicz 1990, Zacharakis and Meyer 1995) while strategies of venture
capital firms are considered in other research (Swartz 1991, Gupta and
Sapienza 1992). Other topics include the relationship between the investor
and venture capital firm (Bygrave 1992, Timmons and Sapienza 1992,
Brophy 1997, Timmons and Bygrave 1997), the ‘valued added’ of venture
capitalists’ human capital to the entrepreneurial firm (Sapienza 1992), the
effects of team processes in the partnership (Watson et al. 1995) and
venture capitalists’ perceptions of serial entrepreneurs (Wright et al. 1997).
Performance of venture capital funds (Burgel and Murray 2000) and
assessment of investment success are more recent topics of study (Keeley et
al. 2000). With the exception of research about decision-making criteria for
evaluating new ventures (Hall and Hofer 1993, Fried and Hisrich 1988,
Zacharakis and Meyer 1995) the majority of empirical work investigates
funding providers who have existing relationships with new ventures. Less
emphasis has been given to deal origination or the process, and early stage
funding, the bulk of research examining the venture capital firm – firm
relationship, returns to investors, venture firm strategy and performance
(Mason and Harrison 1999). In addition, more research attention is on
suppliers as formal venture capitalists rather than the informal angel
investors.
Research on the demand side includes topics such as ‘management’ –
quality of team, capabilities, experience and staying power (MacMillan et
al. 1985, 1987, Gupta and Sapienza 1992, Hall and Hofer 1993), and
profiles for success have been studied using IPO data (Bygrave et al. 1998).
The role of business plans, investment readiness and entrepreneurs’
attitudes towards management control also have been investigated (Bruno
and Tyebjee 1985, MacMillan et al. 1987, Cressy and Olofsson 1997).
Demand-side studies most often consider firms ‘successful’ in their
acquisition of equity capital. Less often explored are earlier stage ventures
seeking financing and the process by which they expend social capital or are
chauffered to equity providers (Mason and Harrison 1999).
Studies about the influence of angels, or informal investors, have taken
a similar tack. Although fewer in number because angels often do not want
to be identified, and in the US are not members of a national organization

<-----Page 5----->CANDIDA G. BRUSH ET AL.

310

like institutional venture capital firms, studies have not focused on the
social capital exchange or contribution to the deal. Studies have compared
angels and non-angels (Freear et al. 1994a), examined the effects of angel
financing in different-sized firms (Mason and Harrison 1995a) and
investigated the role of informal equity in the financing process and the
economy (Freear et al. 1994b, Mason and Harrison 1994b). Recent studies
examined angel and entrepreneur relationships (Kelly and Hay 2001),
informal investment and policy implications and screening criteria for
technology ventures (Mason and Harrison 2000).
Similarly, in the institutional investment literature we find women and
minorities understudied in the angel research (Bygrave 1992, Freear et al.
1994a, Brophy 1997, Timmons and Bygrave 1997). For instance, the
recent Proceedings of the Babson-Kauffman Conference on Entrepreneurship Research (2000) featured 35 papers and summaries on venture capital
or angel investing. Only one considered the gender of the investors or
entrepreneurs. A recent literature review (Brush et al. 2001)1 found no
single academic study that examined the factors that affect women
entrepreneurs’ access to, or utilization of, outside equity funding. Instead,
research about the gender of the business owner and financing has focused
exclusively on access to debt capital (Buttner and Rosen 1988, Riding and
Swift 1990, Coleman 2000). This suggests that what we know about the
entrepreneurs’ strategies for seeking and utilizing equity capital, and the
equity providers’ deal-seeking and investment process is based almost
entirely on the experiences of men. A more complete understanding of
how women entrepreneurs finance their businesses would complement our
existing knowledge of entrepreneurship in general, and research about
female equity providers will increase our knowledge of the deal
origination, evaluation, investment and performance of venture capitalists
and angels.
Research design and methodology
As noted above, few previous studies were identified that examined
women’s participation in the venture capital industry or women entrepreneurs’ acquisition of equity capital. Therefore, it was appropriate to first
describe or map the ‘state’ of women’s participation as both seekers and
suppliers of capital. Our study was conducted in two phases. Phase I was
designed to explore the history and context of the venture capital industry
by analysing the investments in women-owned businesses over time, or the
demand side of the equation. In particular, we were interested in early stage
funding and investments. We supplemented this with an analysis of the
Springboard 2000 presenters. Springboard Venture Forums were created
to accelerate the process of women’s access to equity capital. Events were
held in six cities, including Boston, San Francisco, New York and
Washington DC. The programme was led by a consortium of women’s
organizations such as the National Women’s Business Council and
advocates including Oracle Corporation, Chase Manhattan, Harvard
Business School, Northwestern University, Center for Women and

<-----Page 6----->SOCIAL CAPITAL AND GENDER, FINANCE AND FIRMS

311

Enterprise, Arch Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. These events
showcased more than 200 women entrepreneurs at forums attended by
more than 1000 investors (http://www.springboardenterprises.org/about/).
Phase II focused on women’s participation in the venture capital
industry, or the supply side, where we mapped the role and participation of
women as equity providers. This investigation is part of a comprehensive
longitudinal research programme known as The Diana Project (2001).
Phase I – demand
This research phase utilized a comprehensive dataset of formal equity
providers2, which included information on companies funded by institutional venture capital since 1957. This dataset was made available through
an ongoing project by one of the investigators with the Kauffman Center
for Entrepreneurial Leadership (KCEL) and that Center’s strategic
partnership with the National Venture Capital Association and Venture
Economics, a subsidiary of Securities Data Corp. The dataset included
information on 20 000 portfolio companies, 34 000 executives and 120 000
company investments. The information was provided by 4500 private
equity firms that managed 7000 private equity funds. The data were
collected by the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and were
updated on a quarterly basis.
However, as noted by MacMillan et al. (1985), and as is the case with
many publicly available datasets, this dataset has some common limitations
– i.e. completeness of responses and definitional purity (Phillips and Dennis
1997). In addition, only businesses receiving funding are included in the
dataset, therefore comparisons to businesses not receiving funding are
impossible from this dataset. In order to analyse the dataset, we re-organized,
re-formatted, and re-coded the original dataset. When we received the data,
they were organized in four separate Excel files with multiple redundant
records. It was necessary to review each line of data to determine redundant
company entries and ensure that each investment was counted only once.
This required re-coding, checking and cleaning. Files were transposed,
imported into an SPSS format and merged into a single database.
All responses were coded according to the gender of firm owner or
management, year of first investment, stage at first investment and
industrial sector. The original dataset was not coded for gender of
participants, therefore, it was necessary for us to screen all entries and
code male or female by first name or title (Mr/Mrs/Ms). Entries for which
the gender was not apparent by either criterion were coded ‘2’, used to
establish frequencies, and set aside for further investigation and consideration. We screened according to job title, selecting the highest-ranking role
for each firm as the representative. In cases where both Chairman and
President/CEO were listed, we chose the latter, reasoning that management
capabilities was one of the key determinants in the decision to fund a new
venture (MacMillan et al. 1985, Hisrich and Jancowicz 1990).
Analysable variables included stage of investment (coded: early,
expansion, late, buyout/acquisition) and month/year of investment.

<-----Page 7----->CANDIDA G. BRUSH ET AL.

312

Company characteristics included were geographical location (city, state,
zip), industry (SIC and industry category – e.g. software), gross sales and
owner demographics. Data re-coding was followed by statistical analysis.
We ran frequencies, means and descriptive statistics for the overall dataset,
and for subgroups (gender, decade). This was followed by running crosstabs and X2 analyses to determine if gender was related to stage and/or
amount of investment for all years and for the past 10 years (1988 – 1998),
anticipating that patterns might be different given the increased growth of
the venture capital industry and new business formations by women in the
past decade.
Following this archival data analysis, we analysed the applicant pool to
the Springboard 2000 Venture Forums. For this research, we analysed
information given in the application form provided by 939 potential
presenters to the forums in Silicon Valley, Boston and New York for the
year 2000. Data included firm demographics (year established, number
employees, stage of product development, industry), investment information (financing sought, patents, perception of market size, financing
sought) and management team demographics (size, gender, experience).
Statistical analyses included frequencies and descriptive statistics.
Phase II – supply
We then examined women’s participation in the venture capital industry
using Pratt’s Guide to Venture Capital for 1995 and 2000. Pratt’s Guide
lists venture capital firms that voluntarily report information, such as
location of offices, funds under management, age of company, investment
preferences and management. We chose Pratt’s Guide to Venture Capital
Sources as the standard of industry membership. Although there are other
directories of the industry, including the membership roster of the
National Venture Capital Association and Galante’s Venture Capital and
Private Equity Directory, we believed Pratt’s to be the most comprehensive and consistent source of information. We identified women by names
and their roles in the decision-making hierarchy through visual examination of the volumes. Titles were used to determine role, which were
categorized (e.g. partner, president, CEO, managing director, chairman,
principal, senior vice-president, vice president, associate, other titles). In
cases where titles were not listed, phone calls and website checks were
used to verify. Statistical analysis included frequencies and descriptive
statistics.
Each individual entry was coded by year and job title. Firm
characteristics were included: name, parent company (if any), location(s), age, size of funds, date of last fund raised, and investment
preferences by industry and stage. The number and gender of other
senior decision-making employees (partners/directors) and professionals
(principals and associates) at the firm were also included. The dataset
includes industry and firm demographics at two specific points in time
and allows us to track changes from 1995 to 2000 at industry, firm and
individual levels.

Results
For the 8311 businesses3 for which the leader’s gender could be identified
(in the years between 1957 and 1998), 392 (2.4%) of the investments were
made in women-led ventures, while 14 018 total investments were made
overall during the time period (see table 1). Between 1957 and 1980, there is
no year in which there were more than three identifiable women-led
ventures receiving venture capital, but after 1980, the numbers of
investments grew. Between 1981 and 1987 the greatest number of
investments in women-led ventures was 33 in 1987, representing 4.1% of
all investments. Investments in women-led ventures between 1988 and

Only those years for which women-led ventures received investments are shown; the total
investment in over the period is higher than this table shows because there were investments
made every year between 1953 and 1998, while prior to 1980, there were several years in
which women-led ventures received no investment. Investments in all ventures between
1953 and 1980 totalled 1663, versus 11 for women-led ventures. Percentages may not add up
to 100 due to rounding.

1998 increased to a high of 54 (still representing 4.1%) in 1998. The range
was a low of 9 in 1995 to a high of 43 in 1996, to 52 (3.5%) in 1997, and 54
(4.1%) in 1998.
The analysis of funding by stage of investment showed that the highest
percentage of investments in women-led ventures between 1957 and 1998
were made at the early stage, similar to men-led ventures (see table 2). The
data suggest that, proportionately, women are more likely to receive early
stage funding, whereas men are more likely to receive funding at both early
and later stages. The differences in funding by gender and stage were
significant (table 2.)
Looking at the relationship between stage of development and equity
funding from 1988 – 1998 showed that the bulk of women-led businesses
were funded at the early stage, while in the men-led businesses 39.7% of
investments were at the early stage. In this time period, women were more
likely to receive early stage funding while a greater percentage men-owned
businesses received buy-out and acquisition funding (see table 3). A
comparison of the two time periods shows that the overall proportion of
investments in women-led businesses rose from 4.9% (table 2) to 6.6%
(table 3) and that the percentage of women-led ventures receiving later
stage funding grew incrementally, but not nearly as much as the proportion
of men-led ventures (table 3). Still, the total number of investments
remains very small. Data showed that the number of women starting new
businesses was greater in the past 5 – 10 years (US Census 2001). With the
simultaneous growth in the number of new ventures and expansion of the
venture capital industry, it would be expected that women would be
receiving a significantly higher proportion of investments overall, and
especially at the later stages.
Following our analysis of the archival data from the NVCA, we
examined the pool of applicants for the 2000 Springboard Forums. More
than 60% of the 939 businesses had revenues and 80% desired rapid growth.
The ventures had an average of less than 10 employees, which was expected
for early stage ventures. Most ventures had a management team of four

people that averaged 39 years of industry experience, and 40% of the
management teams had prior start-up experience, and 31% had graduate
degrees in science or technology. Forty-five per cent (n=423) of the
companies had already launched their products. Businesses were primarily
in technology, telecommunications, software, life sciences and internet
sectors, consistent with the Springboard application criteria. We found that
the vast majority of ventures were looking for second-stage investment,
having already received angel or first-stage funding. Average funding
sought was $US1.6 million, with the majority of applicants seeking
between $US1 and $US5 million (see table 4). In sum, a significant
proportion of applicants to the Springboard Forums were in technology
sectors, had experienced management teams, revenues, and launched
products in sectors attractive to venture capitalists. Further, they sought
institutional funding, having already received angel or first stage funding.
These results suggest that even though this convenience sample is limited
by industry, geography and voluntary application submission, nevertheless
we can conclude that there is a significant qualified pool of investable
women-led ventures.
The 1995 Pratt’s Guide to Venture Capital Sources listed 358 women in
the professional ranks and, by 2000, the number had grown to 512. The

search identified 120 firms with at least one woman on the professional
roster in both 1995 and 2000, though in several cases it was not the same
woman. There were 112 women professionals who were not only in the
industry, but also at the same firm in both 1995 and 2000. The analysis of
women’s participation in the venture capital industry reveals that the
number of women in the industry remains very small, in spite of the fact
that the firms employing women managers increased from 1995 to 2000.
Women in decision-making roles did not fare as well in the venture
industry as it might appear (see table 5). The actual percentage of industry
membership did not change over the two time periods. In examining the
pipeline of women moving into decision-making roles compared to men, we
find that between 1995 and 2000 fewer women move into the associates/
entry level positions than men (see table 6). This suggests that even though
the industry expanded, fewer women were getting into these decisionmaking roles. In sum, this research shows that women comprise a very
small minority of venture capital decision-makers.
Discussion and conclusion
Are women being left out of the wealth creation process? This
preliminary investigation suggests the answer is ‘yes’. Our findings show
some women are making significant inroads on the demand side,
especially with regards to early stage financing. Qualified women
entrepreneurs are leading new venture teams that are receiving both
private and early stage institutional investment. However, the proportion

of women receiving funding is disproportionate to the number of women
owning their own ventures. Women owned 28% of all US businesses in
2001 and were partners or major shareholders of 38% (Center for
Women’s Business Research 2002). However, less than 5% of venture
capital (VC) investments made in the United States over the past 40 years
have been in women-led businesses.
On the supply side, women’s participation in the venture capital
industry is extremely small. While women made progress participating
as venture capitalists and moved into decision-making roles, between
1995 and 2000 the industry itself experienced explosive and rapid
growth, and the increase in women’s participation still remained
extremely small. This raises a question as to whether or not there is a
pool of women qualified to be venture capitalists. One survey of 145
venture capitalists over 98 different firms showed that more than 67%
had an MBA and 56% had graduated from Stanford and Harvard. A
majority had more than 10 years’ business experience, which for 34% of
respondents was in corporate management, while 30% were former
entrepreneurs (Smart et al. 2000). By comparison, statistics show that
approximately 25% of all managers of Fortune 200 companies are female
(Catalyst 1998), while more than 37% of all MBAs are female
(www.AACSB.org ). On the other hand, the pool of women qualified
to be venture capitalists by virtue of entrepreneurial experience appears
to be increasing. Another study found that of firms that went public in
1988, there were no women on top management teams but, by 1993,
27% of firms going public had women in the management ranks
(Welbourne and Cyr 1999). While there are no data showing the
percentage of women who tried to get into the industry or would like to
get into the industry, the studies above seem to suggest that there are a
significant number of women capable of working in the equity provider
role, either as angels or institutional investors.
The findings reported here suggest a disconnection between venture
capitalists seeking investments and female entrepreneurs seeking formal
equity capital. What leads to the ‘deal’ (see figure 1)? Missing from research
is an understanding about the point of interaction between the demand and
the supply side for equity capital, particularly that of early stage angel
investment capital. To date, no studies have investigated women angels/
groups and their participation in the seed funding process. Because angel
funding is the first step towards receiving institutional equity capital, a
better understanding of the role of women as suppliers of equity and
recipients of investment will provide a better foundation for understanding
the disparities in the proportion of women participating in both the venture
capital industry, and receiving later stage equity financing.
Angels are, by definition, more difficult to find, thereby potentially
relying upon even greater and more focused levels of social capital. For
women entrepreneurs, it now becomes an even greater challenge to
identify, approach and convince an investor of the value of their firm. The
networks required to locate an angel investor may need to be even more
fine-tuned and focused toward equity experiences than that of the formal
equity providers (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). In addition, as

<-----Page 13----->CANDIDA G. BRUSH ET AL.

318

shown above, the venture capital suppliers are primarily male. If the gender
composition of angel suppliers is similar, the search becomes even more
challenging.
It is likely that few entrepreneurs in their initial interactions with
venture capitalists understand the complex terms involved in an equity
structured investment. It has been posited that women entrepreneurs have
even less education and experience in sophisticated financial arrangements.
The terms set by angel investors should be more readily accessible to
entrepreneurs, although often requiring deep and extensive negotiations
before reaching mutual acceptance. The negotiations of terms may also be
more wide-ranging and accepting of various definitions of timing
(liquidity) and firm performance (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000).
It is also posited that women entrepreneurs may benefit from more
relational types of management (Moore and Buttner 1997). Angel investors
may require or benefit from more care and handling than formal investors,
depending on the level of their desire for involvement. The development of
an organizational culture that supports the angel/entrepreneur interaction
has the potential for providing a relationship that would provide more than
strictly financial resources to the new venture, ultimately having a positive
impact on venture performance and resulting in a firm that is attractive to
more formal or later stage forms of equity capital. However, the obverse
must be noted, that the involvement of an angel investor in the operations
of the firm may also have negative ramifications if not managed
appropriately. It is the point and level of interaction that must fit with
the individuals and organization involved.
Future research directions
This exploratory study suggests opportunities for future research. Are
women being denied the opportunity to share in the wealth flowing to
venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who successfully partner in creating
large and valuable enterprises? Minimal investment in women- and
minority-led ventures diminishes the opportunity for women to grow their
businesses and create wealth. We determined that over a period of 30 years
women received less than 5% of all VC investments. While women’s shares
have increased over recent years, there remains large disparity between
women owning businesses and those receiving equity. Further, the
numbers of women participating as partners in the venture capital industry
is extremely small.
As a starting point for research we adapt a practitioner guide on angel
investment which highlights those points of interaction between investors
and capital seekers (Keeley et al. 1998) (see table 7). The major dimensions
of concern on both the supply and demand side are shown largely as
exchange issues stemming first from social and human capital aspects of the
individuals involved, and evolving to the organizational level as the
relationship develops.
The potential differences between the informal angel investors and the
formal venture capitalists also becomes readily apparent.

Demand side:
. What are the information networks? Are there gender differences in
how entrepreneurs search for and locate angel investors?
. Are there gendered variations in how entrepreneurs develop
organizational culture and systems to manage equity investors?
. Do men and women entrepreneurs utilize different search and
information processes to investigate equity funding options and
sources?
. Are there differences between men- and women-led ventures in
financial strategy and investment of angel and/or first stage equity
funding?
Supply side:
. Are there gender differences in how angel investors search for
investments?
. Are women angels more likely to invest in women-led ventures?
. Are there gender differences in how the deal origination process
works?
. Is the funding process (evaluation, screening and negotiations)
similar for men and women angels venture capitalists? Angels?
. Are there gendered variations in the investment terms, size of
investment, valuation, sector and exit strategy of women and men
angels?

. Are there variations in the returns to women and men angel
investors?
The research agenda suggested here has the potential to address whether
women are being left out of the wealth creation process from the perspective
of both equity suppliers and equity seekers. The impact of women’s severely
limited participation in wealth creation through equity investments has the
potential to influence their ability to build personal and family assets and
therefore has far-reaching social and economic ramifications.

3. Of the 16 135 investments in ventures between 1957 and 1998, we were able to identify the gender of
the founder in 8311. For many cases, the name of the management contact for the business receiving
the investment was only listed by last name, or initial. In other instances, we could not assume that
the first name was male or female. For all cases in which there was any question, the businesses were
counted as ‘unidentifiable’ by leader’s name.
