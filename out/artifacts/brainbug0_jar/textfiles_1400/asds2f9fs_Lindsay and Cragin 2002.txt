1. Opport"lIity Search: Scallllillgfor and Encountering
Possible Opport,," ities
The o ppo rtunity search pro cess invo lves scanni ng the

enviro nm ent for possible o ppo rt unities while loo kin g for
and/or ge ne rating possible ideas. If a potent ial opport unity is encountered, the opportunity search processceases
and the oppo rtunity recogni tion process begi ns.

2. Opportllllity R ecogllition:
Nor mative and lndividuaiized Fit P hases
T his process involves two phases. T he first ph ase involves
reviewing a situatio n to iden tify w he ther it is a poten tial
opportunity in broad and general terms. The seco nd
ph ase invo lves det ermining w he ther th e o ppo rtu nity
specij/call)' is an oppo rtunity fo r the particular entrepreneur
or financier.

2. 1 N onnative 0 pp0rrl m;ty Recognition Phase:
"Is this an opportunity?'
T his is th e first p hase of the opportuni ty recognitio n pro cess. During this phase. a nor mative o ppo rtunity pattern
recognition template is used to screen the potential opportuni ty. T his template co ntains "no rmative" cues (such as

those that relate to the market, team, product/technology,
etc.) and "no rmative" we ighrings fo r those c ues in terms
of em "ideal" potencial o ppo rtunity. In this regard, ideal
" pattern s" exist for the cues collec tively at higher levels
and their co nstitue nt lower-level subpart'.
At this level, we suggest that anyon e who has significant
experience in the entreprene urial do main will have develo ped a fundarn en tal o ppo rtu nity pat ter n templ are. T his
temp late will co ntain simi lar cues and "gui dance" as to
ho w to evaluate pot e ntial o ppo rtun ity scenarios in terms
of those cues .

and general level and th at, in fact, there wo uld be universal ag ree ment am o ng th em 0 11 this issue. We wo uld
exp e ct differen ces 31110 ng the se ex pe rie nced de cisio n
makers, however, with th e seco nd phase of the o ppo rtunity recognition process: the individ ualized fit oppo rtunity recognitio n p hase.

2. 2 Individualiz ed Fit Opporlt/llity Recognition Phase:
Ills th is fl l/ opportuuil. yfor me/us?"
T his is the seco nd phase of th e oppo rtunity recognition
pro cess. Du on g th is phase, th e previo usly id e nt ifi ed
po tential oppo rtunity is evaluated in terms o f how well
it "fits" the e ntre pre ne ur's or financie r's pe rsonal and/or

business-related criteria. In this regard, an individualized
fit o pportunity recogn ition tem plate is used to sc re e n
the opportunity.
We speculate that, during this phase, the "fit" ofthe iden tified o ppo rtunity is deter mi ned in ter ms of individu alized item s suc h as: prej udices; preferences; o bjectives (fo r
exam ple, lifestyle); skills, know- how, and exper ie nc e
levels; risk preferences; and timi ng im plicatio ns. As such,
there will be divergen ce among the vario us gro ups o f
decision m akers (and w ithin g roups of decision makers)
as to whether an identifi ed given po tenti al oppo rt unity
is an o ppo rtunity spec ifically for th em.

3. Opporlll"ity Evaluation or Verificatio,,:
Due Diligence and Funds Com miunent
Where there app ears to be a " go od " fit, th e decision w ill
be nude to proceed to the oppo rtunity evaluatio n o r verification phase. This will involve collecting info rmation

(tho ugh not necessarily for them ), T hus, we wo uld expect
that th ere wo uld be no differen ces am o ng peo ple who

opp ortunity verificatio n phase also will involve a decision
as to w hether the entrepreneur Or fin ancie r w ill commi t

exam ple, an en trepreneur o r financi er may dec ide not to

diligen ce o utco me was positive because they may o btain

Th ese ap pear to include (and arc no t lim it ed to ) th e
entreprene ur ial team , th e m arket, and/ o r the techno logy
(see, for exam ple, Ti mmons 11'19'1]). In so rt ing throu gh
the ran ge o f cues in th e o ppo rt unity recogni tio n process,
crea tive th inking (involving cross- associatio ns o f chunks
o f exp er ience, kn o w-b ow, and co ntacts) is used to synrhesize the var io us cues and recognize patterns in the
business co m plexity (see, fo r ex am ple, im on 11 ':1 51).
Simo n 11 9851descr ibes pattern recogn ition as a creative
process th at is not sim ply logi cal, linear, and addi tive; it
is o ften intuitive and ded uctive. He argues that it takes
10 years o r m o re fo r peo ple to develo p appropr iate levels
ofexpe rience to allow the m to recognize patt erns in new
situ atio ns based o n previo us experien ce.
Put sim ply, indi viduals develop cogn itively based
fram eworks for genera ting explanatio ns of their situatio ns
(Gooding and Kinicki 11 9951). T he more tim es th at an

It is here wh ere the exper ience and heuristics cum ulate
and arc sto red in th e for m o f an " o ppo rtunity patt ern

wh ich pot ential o ppo rt unities can be co mpared. Entreprene ur ial actio ni n using th e tem plate to seek "opportuni ty hits" and ensur ing against " missed o ppo rt un ities,"
however , will m ore likely occur fo r indi vidu als in a promoti o n- focused state o f eage rness. It w ill depend o n th eir
entrep re ue u ria l aptitude and attitu de (M cM ulle n and

Since experien ce in an ent reprene urial co ntext-eWINIU l. 2002

as a habitu al entrepre neur or an experie nced pr ivate equity

Procedures
A research team was for med to collec t th e data
fro m ex pe rie nced e n trepre ne u rs and pr ivate eq u ity
finan ciers. A list was co llated from orga nizatio ns and
individuals kn own to th e g ro up, financier s listed ill a

listed in governme nt- co llated databases. Participants were

Results an d Discussion
T here were few sign ificant differen ces betwee n the
entrepreneur and private equity financier groups. O verall,
th is lends suppo n to th e noti o n th at ex peri e nced
en trepreneurs and private equity financiers develop a general level of understandin g that allows them to recognize
business oppo rtu nities at a broad and genera l level.
T he re were min or differen ces bet ween the two
groups, however, for the followi ng hypot heses: Hypothesis 1 (alertness to opportunities), Hvpothesis 2 (creativity
and idea generation), Hypothesis 3 (search processes and
strategies), H)'pothesis 5 (opportu nity sources), and Hypothesis 6 (evaluation and " gut feel"). T hese differen ces related
to a spec ific questio n within vario us catego ries of questions o n the questionnaire rather than bro ad differen ces
across the majori ty of questio ns in each catego ry. Details
are as follows:
Hypothesis 1-Alertuess to O pportunities: O verall,
th ere were no differences on the measures of alertness; however, e ntrepreneurs were significantly different o n one qu estion , believing that they had a
special sensitivity o r alertness toward opp ortunities
(t = 1.963; P < 0.05). Enrrep reneu rs tend to be very
positive people and tend to have stro ng beliefs in
their capabilities. T his result can be interpreted as
dem on srraring the strength o f entreprene ur beliefs

in th eir "gut feel" ill identifying op po rt unities. T he
reality, however, o fte n is different as financiers well
kn ow. M any bu sinesses do no t succeed Pr ivate
equity fina n ciers may be mor e cautio us in their
beliefs that they are alert to recogn izing oppo rtun ities perhaps because o f previous funding decisio ns
that have " gone had."

Hypothesis 2-Creati,tity alld Idea Gerreratioll:
Overall, there were no differen ces on the measures
of creativity and idea ge ne ration. Entrep rene urs,
however, differed o n th e imp ortance of business
ideas in the creative process (t = 2.24 \ ; P < 0.05).
Compared to financiers, entreprene urs tho ught that
ideas were more important, Financiers deal in potential oppo rt un ities th at are presen ted to th em by
en trep rene urs w hereas entrep reneurs need to sift
thro ugh and generate many ideas before ide ntifying
an o pportunity that th ey can present for fund ing
conside ration. As such, it is a matter ofdegree. W hat
begins as an idea for an e ntreprene ur beco mes a
business proposition for a finan cier. Th o ugh
financiers need to use both right and left brain skills
in evaluating business prop osals. their quantitative
leani ngs may ex'Plain their preference for evaluatio n
rather than idea generation.
Hypoth esis 3-Search Processes alld Strategies:
O verall, there were no differences on the measure
o f search processes and strateg ies. Entrepren eu rs,
however. believed mo re strongly than fina nciers that
one idea leads to ano ther (r = 4.054; p < 0.001). T his
is not surprising. Financiers receive discrete business prop ositio ns from various sources for funding
conside ration. Presum ably, o ne prop osition wo uld
have no relation to rhe next . Entrepren eurs, o n th e
other hand, are at a lowe r level in tr ying to ide ntify
opportu nities and nlay use ideas generated or insights
gleaned from one situation as a "springboard" to
the next . In additio n, it suppo rts th e no tio n that
entrepreneurs are more open to ideas than financiers,
Hy pothesis 4--Callses ojOpportJlt.ities: Th ere were
no differen ces between entreprene urs and financiers
on th e measures of the un derlying causes of opportunities. Bo th groups appear to be attuned to th e
fact that there are opporrunities associated with problem s and market related changes.

first, th is find ing perpl exed us as we ex pected tha t
financiers wo uld rely heavily On th eir network of

idea so urce.
Hypoth esis 6-Erm/uotiolJ and " G ut Feel": O verall,
there we re no di fferen ces 0 11 th e m easures of I,;valnatio n and "gut feel." Fin anciers, however, fclt significantl y m o re stro ngly than en trepre ne urs (c =
4 .85 6; P < 0.05) th at formal market research is
imp ortant w he n evaluating ideas. T his reflects, perhaps. a g reate r tenden cy toward th o rou gh ness o f
financiers and the fact th at th ey are used to undertakin g " d u e di ligen ce " o n the claims o f e n trepren eurs via indep en dent, third-party so urces.
Entrep reneurs, however, have to make decision s and
wo rk w ith o nly parti al m arket and o the r information to develo p thei r o ppo rtu nities.
Overall. th e re fore. th ere we re few di ffer en ces
bet ween th e two gro ups. Experienced (ha birual) entrepren eurs and ex perienced pr ivate eq uity pro vider s appear
to recogni ze o pportu nities at a broad and ge ne ral level in

RESEARCH CO NTRIBUTION
Despit e its limitation s, this research makes a co ntributi on at two levels. At th e rheo rerical level, it ex tends Our
un derstanding of th e o pportunity recogniti on process and
co ntr ibutes toward th e development o f a th eory of oppo rtuni ty recognition-not just for enrrepreneurs but also
fo r pr ivate eq uity financiers of entreprene ur ial ventures.
Specifically, th e research m akes a co ntr ibutio n to
th e literature by proposin g that th e o ppo rtu nity recognition process is di vided int o two phases: I) th e " nor -rnative" o pport u nity recog nition phase and 2) the
" individ ualized fit" o ppo rt unity recognitio n phase (see.
for exa mple, C raig and Lindsay (200 11). It also suppo rts
th e no tion th at, providi ng that th ere is rele vant informatio n available ro all decisio n makers (info rmatio n symmerries), expe r ie nce d o r habitu al en tre pre ne urs and
expe ri enced pri vate eq uity financiers have th e capability
of recog nizin g, un iver sally, w hen a g iven o pp o rt un i ty
exists at a broa d and ge ne ral level. T he o pportunity, however, may no t be an o ppo rt unity for them specifically
though they w ill be able to reco gnize it as a given o ppo rtuni ty . . . at least as an o ppo rtu nity for so m eo ne. In other
wo rds, a given o ppo rtu nity may be an o ppo rt unity for
so m eo ne else w here th e " individ ua lized fit " wit h the
o ppo rt unity is m ore appropriate to th at o the r perso n/
entity. (B usiness angels and venture capitalists, for exa mple,
differ in th e importance th ey attac h to market risk and
age ncy ri sk in evaluating o pport u nities (H arriso n and
M ason [2002]) . Alth ou gh bo th gro ups m ay pe rce ive a
given o ppo rt unity at a broad level. that sam e o ppo rt uni ty may be preferred by o ne party over th e o ther du e to
risk prefe rences.)
Where th ere are infor ma tio n asym metr ic among
ex pe rience d decision m aker s (relevant information is not
distributed eq ually to all decision makers), however, th ere
still may be ind ividu al difference s in recogni zin g a given
o ppo rtun ity at a broad and ge nera l level amo ng ex pe rience d entreprene urs and pri vate eq uity financiers (see, for
example, Shane (2000 1). o rne decision makers may kn ow
abo ut parti cular custo me r problem s, market character istics, o r th e ways [Q create parti cular prod ucts o r services
w hereas o ther decisio n mak er s 1113y no t (Venkatarama n
[19971). Th is may help to explain w hy private equ ity

At the applied level, th e research pro vides a basis for

A m ajor co n ce rn o f any in vestor always is Type I
investm ent e rro r: placin g m oney in an invesrce w h en t he
