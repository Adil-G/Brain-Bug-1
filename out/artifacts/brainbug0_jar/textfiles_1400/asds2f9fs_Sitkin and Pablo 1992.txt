Past research has resulted in contradictory findings concerning the
effect of risk on decision-making behavior in organizations. This article proposes a model that reconciles these unresolved contradictions
by examining the usefulness of placing risk propensity and risk perception in a more central role than has been previously recognized.
Based on this analysis. it is posited that risk propensity dominates
both the actual and perceived characteristics of the situation as a
determinant of risk behavior. Propositions derived from the conceptual model provide an agenda for future research on individual risk
behavior in organizational settings.

In recent years, the role of risk in organizations has gained increased
recognition as the consequences of risky decisions have become more visible. Most scholars who have studied decision-making behavior regarding
risky organizational situations have focused on single determinants of this
behavior. This approach obviously does not reflect the complexity of real life;
furthermore, it has led to potentially inaccurate conclusions about the
causes of risk behavior.
Consider, for example, Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) influential
"prospect theory" research, which suggests that how a situation is framed
will determine individual risk behavior. However, several studies have presented contradictory results to those predicted by prospect theory. For example, Osborn and Jackson (1988) and Thaler and Johnson (1990) focused on
the outcomes of an individual's prior risk-taking behavior to predict future
risk behavior. Although Kahneman and Tversky found that individuals who
are protecting prior gains are risk averse, Osborn and Jackson and Thaler
and Johnson found exactly the opposite result in that past success led to a

willingness to take risks. In addition, according to Staw, Sandelands, and
Dutton (1981), when individuals are threatened by likely losses they become
the exact opposite reaction from that prerigid and risk averse-again,
dicted by prospect theory.
These contradictory findings not only have been left unresolved, they
have not even been recognized in the literature to date. This article proposes a more integrated, complete, and accurate model of the determinants
of risk behavior than has been formulated in the past by making three
primary arguments. First, prior researchers have suffered from a fragmented, issue-oriented focus that has resulted in overly simplified models in
which a variety of individual, organizational, and problem-related characteristics are posited to directly influence individual risk behavior. Second, a
review of past research suggests that these previously identified characteristics do not influence risk behavior directly, but only indirectly, via the
mediating mechanisms of risk propensities and risk perceptions. And third,
once these relationships have been reformulated, contradictory findings in
past research become apparent, but reconcilable in a rather unexpected
and provocative way that clarifies the relative influence of risk propensity
and risk perception on risk behavior. In addition, propositions derived from
the model proposed in this article form the basis of a future research agenda
regarding the determinants of individual risk behavior.

Risk Dimensions and Definitions
Risk is a characteristic of decisions that is defined here as the extent to
which there is uncertainty about whether potentially significant and/or disappointing outcomes of decisions will be realized. This definition of risk
captures three key dimensions that are essential for its understanding: outcome uncertainty, outcome expectations, and outcome potential.
Outcome uncertainty. Risk is most frequently associated with outcome
uncertainty, which is often defined in terms of the variability of outcomes
(Libby & Fishburn, 1977), lack of knowledge of the distribution of potential
outcomes (March, 1978), and the uncontrollability of outcome attainment
(Vlek & Stallen, 1980). Variability is usually considered to be normatively
undesirable unless it is adequately counterbalanced by higher expected
returns (e.g., Bowman, 1980; MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986), in part because higher variance in the distribution of outcomes increases the uncertainty with which a given outcome can be predicted. Lack of knowledge of
potential outcome distributions captures the dual concerns over what outcomes are possible (i.e., what options are included in the set of potential
outcomes) and how likely it is that various outcomes will be realized. Without such knowledge, expectancies cannot be calculated and preferences
may be unclear. To the extent that outcomes are uncontrollable and occur
purely by chance, risk is higher than in situations in which outcomes can be
influenced, even modestly, by the decision maker.
Outcome expectations. A number of theoretical formulations of decision-related risk (e.g., Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Figenbaum & Thomas, 1988;

<-----Page 3----->1992

Sitkinand Pablo

11

Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) suggest that positive
expected returns elicit fundamentally different decision-framing and decision-making behavior than do outcome sets with negative expected values.
Although some have noted that the term risk typically is applied only to
negative outcomes (Baird & Thomas, 1985; Levitt & March, 1988), our conceptualization of risk includes a full range of outcomes, both positive and
negative. This is because it is not the expected outcome itself that constitutes
a risk but the degree to which that outcome would be disappointing to the
decision maker or other key stakeholders. Therefore, it is the gap between
aspiration levels and the mean of the distribution of expected outcomes that
is crucial. From this vantage point, even a positive outcome can be disappointing if it is judged against sufficiently challenging aspiration levels
(Lopes, 1987; March & Shapira, 1987).
Outcome potential. When individuals ask, "How bad could it get?" or
"How much could I win?" these questions reflect another aspect of risk that
has received little attention in the literature: individuals often overweight
extreme outcomes, even if their likelihood of being realized is remote
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). This may explain, for example, individuals'
willingness to purchase lottery tickets, where the perceived probability of
winning is inflated because the potential outcome is so great (Allman, 1985).
This dimension of risk can be conceptualized in two ways. First, the potential consequences of choice must be perceived to be of sufficient magnitude
for decision makers to attend to the potential threat or opportunity inherent
in the situation (Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Lounamaa & March, 1987). Thus,
the range of potential outcomes provides an indicator of how extreme the
outcome could potentially be. Second, outcomes may exhibit a sort of
threshold or step function where the range of outcomes is more appropriately conceptualized as a categorical rather than a continuous variable
(Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Mintzberg, Raisinghani, &
Theoret, 1976), particularly near the endpoints.
Defining risk behavior. For some time, scholars have been interested
in the factors that influence individuals' decision-making behavior in risky
contexts (e.g., Hogarth, 1987; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), which we will
refer to as risk behavior. Risk behavior may be characterized by the degree
of risk associated with the decisions made. Corresponding to our earlier
dimensionalization of risk, we define decisions as riskier to the extent that (a)
their expected outcomes are more uncertain, (b) decision goals are more
difficult to achieve, or (c) the potential outcome set includes some extreme
consequences. Using this conceptualization, we will examine the various
factors that have been posited previously to influence individual risk behavior.

Existing Approaches to Predicting Risk Behavior
There are three clusters of factors that influence a decision maker when
he or she must choose a more or less risky response to a problem: characteristics of the individual decision maker, characteristics of the organiza-

tional context, and characteristics of the problem itself. Although there are
an almost infinite number of potentially relevant individual-, organizational-, and problem-related characteristics, the literature has focused on
nine key predictors of risk behavior, so we will restrict our attention to these.
Past research has identified three individual characteristics as likely determinants of risk behavior: risk preferences, risk perceptions, and risk propensity. In addition, four organizational characteristics have been posited to
directly affect individual risk behavior: group composition, cultural risk values, leader risk orientation, and organizational control systems. Finally, two
problem-related characteristics have been the focus of scholarly attention:
problem familiarity and problem framing. Although this list of determinants
is not exhaustive, it represents the current literature. Each of these variables
will be discussed briefly.
Individual characteristics. Risk preferences (Brockhaus, 1980) have
been suggested as one individual characteristic that influences individual
actions. Simply stated, decision makers who enjoy the challenge that risks
entail will be more likely to undertake risky actions than those individuals
who do not. This idea is illustrated in research that suggests that the preference for achievement is stronger in some individuals than their desire to
avoid failure (McClelland, 1961).
The second determinant, risk perceptions, is defined as a decision maker's assessment of the risk inherent in a situation. Our definition of perceived
risk is consistent with previous work that has defined it in terms of (a) the
decision maker's labeling of situations (Douglas, 1985; Dutton & Jackson,
1987; Jackson & Dutton, 1988), (b) probabilistic estimates of the extent and
controllability of risks, and (c) confidence in those estimates (Baird & Thomas, 1985; Duncan, 1972; Vlek & Stallen, 1980). Risk perceptions have drawn
scholarly attention in part because of their impact on decision makers' behavior, leading decision makers to deny uncertainty, to overestimate or
underestimate risks, and to exhibit unwarranted confidence in their judgmen'ts (Bazerman, 1986; Roll, 1986; Slovic, 1972), knowledge (Monroe, 1976;
Rao & Monroe, 1988), and ability to perform under risky conditions (Allman,
1985; March & Shapira, 1987; Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1980).
The third individual characteristic posited to influence risk behavior is
risk propensity. Risk propensity has been conceptualized most frequently as
an individual's risk-taking tendencies. For example, MacCrimmon and
Wehrung's (1990: 25) study of executive risk behavior conceptualizes risk
propensity in terms of "measures of willingness to take risks" and stresses
consistent patterns of risk taking or risk aversion that influence how risks are
evaluated and what risks are deemed to be acceptable (Baird & Thomas,
1985; Fischhoff, Lichtenstein, Slovic, Derby, & Keeney, 1981; Kogan &
Wallach, 1964; Rowe, 1977). Therefore, risk propensity is defined here as the
tendency of a decision maker either to take or to avoid risks. Because the
model proposed in this article clearly distinguishes risk perceptions and risk
preferences from risk propensity, the use here of the term propensity is
consistent with Brockhaus's (1980) conceptualization of the term, but it does

<-----Page 5----->1992

not conform either to his formal definition (which includes preferences) or to
his empirical operationalization (which measures perceptions, rather than
propensities or preferences). In the arena of individual risk taking, the occasional resurgence of interest in dispositional predictors of individual behavior is reflected in the contention that individuals have a predisposition
for taking or avoiding specific risks (Kogan & Wallach, 1964). For example,
Brockhaus (1980) hypothesized that the overall orientation of the individual
toward risk would predispose some individuals (e.g., entrepreneurs) to undertake more risks than other individuals (e.g., bureaucrats), and MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1990) found that more mature decision makers (in terms
of age and seniority) were consistently more risk averse than those who
were less mature.
Organizational characteristics. Of the four organizational sources of
influence on risk behavior, the composition of the group within which riskrelated decisions are made is one of the most prominently cited predictors of
risk behavior. Janis's (1972) groupthink hypothesis and the notion of the risky
shift (Stoner, 1968) are both familiar examples of theories that focus on the
role of group decision-making contexts as influencing individual risk behavior. According to this work by Janis, Stoner, and others, group contexts tend
to influence individuals to take more extreme positions with regard to risk.
As defined by Hofstede (1980: 19), the culture of a collectivity is characterized by values that reflect a "broad tendency to prefer certain states of
affairs over others." Organizational tendencies to prefer certainty versus
uncertainty and risk avoidance versus risk seeking may be defined as an
organization's cultural risk values (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982). These values and the leader's risk orientation represent two additional organizational
characteristics that have been suggested as similarly influencing individual
risk behavior in organizations. Some authors have proposed organizational
typologies (e.g., Deal & Kennedy, 1982) that suggest that organizational
cultures (e.g., the "bet your company" or the "process" culture) systematically encourage or discourage risky behavior by individual organizational
members. Similar to the channeling function of culture, numerous authors
have pointed to the important role of leaders in modeling risk-related behavior and in lending their personal legitimacy to the taking or avoiding of
risks (Jacofsky, Slocum, & McQuaid, 1988; MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986;
Nutt, 1986; Schein, 1985).
The organization's control systems are a fourth organizational characteristic that has been suggested as influencing decision-maker risk behavior
(March & Shapira, 1987). When the outcomes of risky decisions are rewarded or punished, or the willingness to take risks is encouraged or discouraged as part of an effective decision-making process, the organization
is viewed as ultimately channeling the decision maker's risk behavior by
monitoring, evaluating, and rewarding the outcomes achieved and processes used (Ouchi, 1977) when risks are involved.
Problem characteristics. One problem-related feature that has been
modeled as a determinant of risk behavior is the decision maker's experi-

ence or familiarity with the situation. When decision makers are more experienced, they may begin to focus selectively on the evidence of their past
ability to overcome obstacles (March & Shapira, 1987) and, therefore, may
be willing to undertake risks that less experienced individuals would avoid.
The escalating commitment model (Staw & Ross, 1987) is also consistent with
the notion that individual experiences can foster increasingly risky behavior
over time. Slovic, Fischoff, and Lichtenstein (1980) proposed an alternative
to the linear model of experience and risk when they argued that the prior
experience of decision makers influences risk behavior by encouraging
higher levels of confidence in extremely experienced or inexperienced individuals. This U-shaped relationship between experience and choice behavior is similar to recent research on consumer choice behavior (Monroe,
1976; Rao & Monroe, 1988).
Perhaps the most well-known problem-related characteristic posited to
influence risk behavior is problem framing. This refers to whether the situation is presented to the decision maker in a positive or negative light, as an
opportunity or a problem, or in terms of gains or losses. In an influential
study of individual risk behavior under conditions of varied problem frames,
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) formulated prospect theory, noting that positively framed situations led to risk-averse behavior, whereas negatively
framed situations led to risk-seeking behavior. In a number of succeeding
studies (e.g., Neale, Bazerman, Northcraft, & Alperson, 1986; Singh, 1986),
the influence of problem framing on risk behavior has been found to be
robust.

An Alternative Model: The Central Role of Risk Propensities
and Perceptions
Based on an integrative analysis of existing theory and empirical findings, this article proposes an alternative model of the determinants of risk
behavior. In this reformulated model, the previously proposed direct effects
on risk behavior operate indirectly, that is, via the mediating mechanisms of
risk propensity and risk perception. In addition, this model exposes contradictory findings not recognized by existing models. Furthermore, the analysis of the usefulness of this new model reveals a means for reconciling
these contradictions.

The mediating role of risk propensities. As was noted, authors have
examined the role of risk preferences (Brockhaus, 1980) as a direct influence
on risk behavior. However, the reconceptualized model suggests that this
factor, coupled with the inertia of the decision maker and the outcomes of
prior risky decisions, affects risk behavior indirectly through its impact on
the decision maker's risk propensity. This conceptualization reflects the observation that previous approaches do not offer a causal mechanism by
which preferences are translated directly into observed behavior. Particularly within tradition-laden organizational contexts, preferences are at best
one of several influences (inertia and history of prior outcomes of risk behavior are the others) on a general tendency for a person to either take or

<-----Page 7----->Sitkinand Pablo

avoid risks. A focus on tendencies recognizes that the general desire to
pursue or avoid risks (i.e., risk preferences) does not determine specific risk
behaviors, but rather it affects the general likelihood of a person's behaving
in more or less risky ways (i.e., risk propensity).
The mediating role of risk perceptions. As discussed in the previous
section, scholars have recognized the role that a variety of organizational
and problem characteristics have in influencing risk behavior: these include
group homogeneity (Janis, 1972), cultural risk values (Douglas & Wildavsky,
1982; Hofstede, 1980), a leader's risk orientation (Schein, 1985), organizational control systems (Ouchi, 1977), problem familiarity (Slovic et al., 1980),
and problem framing (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Although the reformu-

lated model draws upon this work, it is suggested that these organizational
and problem-related characteristics can influence risk behavior only indirectly. That is, by creating limits on what information is attended to, by
limiting an individual's ability to notice and respond to risky situations, and
by creating systems of incentives that influence how an individual will evaluate risky situations, the previously identified organizational and problem
characteristics affect risk behavior only by influencing what is perceived.
In sum, past research suggests a model (see Figure 1) in which risk
propensity and risk perceptions appear to be central, mediating influences
on risk behavior.
In the next two sections, the main effects of key variables on risk propensity and risk perception are examined. Although it is possible, and even
likely, that interactions among these variables also may have an influence,
a discussion of these effects is not included in this article. Because the
purpose of this article is to set forth a broad theoretical framework for examining risk behavior, the added complexity of interaction effects is more
appropriately deferred for subsequent research that focuses on specific subsets of variables in this model. Some examples of possible interaction effects
are, however, addressed in the Discussion section, where potentially fruitful
areas for future research are discussed.

DETERMINANTS
OF RISKPROPENSITY
Past research findings suggest three determinants of decision-maker
risk propensity: risk preferences, inertia, and history of risk-related success
and failure. Proposed causal relationships are depicted in Figure 1 by
numbering each path to correspond to the associated proposition.
Risk Preferences. Individual differences in risk preference have been
attributed to a general dispositional risk orientation (Kogan & Wallach,
1964), to achievement orientation (McClelland, 1961), and to the type of
managerial position held (e.g., see Brockhaus, 1980, for a discussion of line
versus staff positions and entrepreneurial versus bureaucratic managers).
Personal experience or beliefs about risk foster identifiable preferences in
how decision makers assess and react to risk (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982;
Slovic, 1972). The general argument emerging from these studies is that
individuals exhibit stable differences in whether they prefer or disdain risks.
These works further suggest that individual risk disposition is a good predictor of what individuals' attitudes toward risk will be for a specific type of
context. Although it seems almost definitional to state that individuals will
have a tendency to do that which they prefer to do, such a contention is far
from universally accepted in the organizational literature, in which authors
generally argue that individual characteristics (such as preferences) will be
dominated by the organizational situation (e.g., Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989;
Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978).
Proposition 1: The risk propensity of decision makers will
be consistent with their preferences concerning risk.

<-----Page 9----->1992

Inertia. Just as organizations develop institutionalized responses to risk
(Douglas, 1985; Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982), individuals also exhibit habitual or routine ways of handling risk-related situations that predispose them
to react in predictable ways. An individual's orientation toward handling
risks in specific contexts tends to persist over time, forming a relatively stable
pattern (Kogan & Wallach, 1964; Rowe, 1977; Slovic, 1972). Consistent with
this general argument, we hypothesize that decision makers who have
been risk averse in the past will tend to continue in their cautious ways,
whereas previously risk-seeking decision makers will continue to be more
adventurous. One explanation for this observed tendency to persist in past
patterns of handling risk is that decision makers exhibit inertia; that is, even
with a special stimulus to try something different, they will often continue to
utilize processes and criteria they have used in the past. This is more counterintuitive than it at first appears in that it suggests that inertial forces
transcend changes in situational risk.
Proposition 2: Over time, decision makers will exhibit inertia in their risk propensity.
Outcome history. The role of outcome history is notably absent in many
theories of risk behavior. For example, the contention in prospect theory that
situational conditions have a significant main effect on risk taking (e.g.,
decision makers will be risk averse in situations within the domain of gains)
does not take historical patterns of success and failure into account
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). This ahistorical viewpoint is challenged by
research findings that have shown prior success in risk taking can alter risk
propensity. For example, Osborn and Jackson (1988) and Thaler and
Johnson (1990) found that decision makers will seek risks in the domain of
gains if prior risk-seeking actions were successful. The same logic of reinforcement and tradition can be applied to successful risk-averse decision
makers who, in Osborn and Jackson's study, continued in their cautious
ways given the prior success of such a strategy. That is, the persistence of
a particular propensity toward risk will be contingent upon the prior success
of that risk propensity. To the extent that decision makers can associate
outcomes with their actions, successful risk-averse decision makers will become increasingly risk averse, and successful risk-seeking decision makers
will become increasingly risk seeking.
In contrast with the stability and persistence exhibited by previously
successful decision makers, we suggest that unsuccessful decision makers
will continue to search for the success that eludes them by frequently altering their approach. If positive feedback reinforces successful decision makers, leading them to experiment less with alternative strategies over time,
then negative feedback received by unsuccessful decision makers is hypothesized to lead to increasing variation in their strategies. March (1988: 12)
has made a parallel argument with respect to organizations: "Organizations that are persistently successful tend to become fixated on one strategy
or another, independent of their comparative values. Organizations that

<-----Page 10----->18

Academy of Management Review

January

are persistently unsuccessful tend to keep shifting strategies" (Lave &
March, 1975).
Proposition 3a: Decision makers' propensity to take risks
will be contingent upon the degree of outcome success
associated with their past propensity to take risks.
We can extend March's insight by noting that the magnitude (i.e., how
major or minor the risk-related failures were) and schedule (i.e., whether
previous failure experiences were continuous or intermittent) of past outcomes can also affect the likelihood of engaging in experimentation and
other indicators of risk-taking propensity.
When major failures are intermittent, it is expected that escalating commitment processes would lead to an increased likelihood of increasingly
narrow future courses of action (Staw & Ross, 1987). In contrast, continuous
major failure would be predicted to lead to learned helplessness (Seligman,
1975) and a more passive management approach, which would also lead to
an increasingly narrow, invariant set of response tendencies. Thus, it is
predicted that major failures will foster a general decrease in the variability
of risk propensity.
In contrast with major failure, it is expected that minor failures will foster
increased variability. For intermittent minor failure, the expectation would
be that reinforcement processes and a barely sufficient glimpse of success
will promote persistent experimentation (Sitkin, 1992), a prediction consistent with recent experimental results (e.g., Lant & Montgomery, 1987). For
continuous minor failure, the expectation would be an increase in the tendency toward an almost random response pattern, as the individual reacts
without the benefit of observing outcomes that provide clear guidelines for
action. These propositions are shown in Figure 2 and suggest the following:
Proposition 3b: The variability of decision makers' risk
propensity will decrease with increases in the scale of
prior failure outcomes, but will be unaffected by the
schedule of prior failure outcomes.

OF RISKPERCEPTION
DETERMINANTS
Five of the variables identified by previous researchers as directly affecting risk behavior (problem framing, top-management team homogeneity, organizational control systems, the social influences of the organization's cultural risk values and leader risk orientation, and problem domain
familiarity) appear to be more properly conceptualized as influencing risk
perceptions. In addition, it is important to consider the theoretical support for
proposing risk propensity as another determinant of risk perception. The
hypothesized relationships between these variables and risk perception are
explored in the next sections. The propositions derived for each proposed
relationship are also keyed numerically to path labels shown in Figure 1.
Risk propensity. An important influence on a decision maker's risk
perception is the general tendency of the decision maker to take or avoid

risks, that is, the decision maker's risk propensity. A risk-averse decision
maker is more likely to attend to and weigh negative outcomes (Schneider
& Lopes, 1986), thus overestimating the probability of loss relative to the
probability of gain and requiring a higher probability of gain to tolerate
exposure to failure. Conversely, a risk-seeking decision maker will attend to
and weigh positive outcomes more highly and, thus, will tend to overestimate the probability of gain relative to the probability of loss (Brockhaus,
1980; Vlek & Stallen, 1980). Thus, risk seekers may be willing to tolerate
exposure to failure with lower probability of gain.
Proposition 4: Decision makers who have a risk-seeking
propensity will perceive risks to be lower than decision
makers who have a risk-averse propensity.
Problem framing. Another important influence on decision maker risk
perceptions is whether the problem is framed in positive or negative terms.
Although prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) does not directly
address risk perceptions, it is consistent with both the theory and its empirical tests to posit that the effect of framing is mediated by risk perception.
According to prospect theory, individuals who are in favorable circumstances are more risk averse, in part, because they feel they have more to
lose. In contrast, those who believe they are in unfavorable conditions may
feel they have little to lose and are therefore more risk seeking. The perceptual mechanisms that might underlie the behavioral focus of prospect
theory suggest the following:
Proposition 5a: Positively framed situations will be perceived as involving higher risk than is normatively appropriate, whereas negatively framed situations will be
perceived as involving a level of risk that is lower than
normatively appropriate.

<-----Page 12----->20

Other theoretical perspectives (e.g., Dutton & Jackson, 1987) also highlight the importance of situational framing in determining a decision maker's perception of risk, but directly contradict the predictions of prospect
theory. By stressing the potential losses implied by a decision, the salience
of risk is heightened. In contrast, by stressing potential gains, the perception
that serious risks are involved is likely to be lessened. Specifically, it has
been argued that positively framed situations foster risk taking by drawing
managerial attention to opportunities rather than risks (March & Shapira,
1987), whereas negatively framed situations foster risk avoidance in the
form of threat-rigidity responses (Staw, Sandelands, & Dutton, 1981) or hypervigilance (Janis & Mann, 1977). Thus, empirical support for several theoretical approaches directly contradicts the predictions of prospect theory.
Proposition 5b: Negatively framed situations will be perceived as involving higher risk than is normatively appropriate, whereas positively framed situations will be
perceived as involving a level of risk that is below a normatively acceptable limit.
Top-management team homogeneity. In recent years, the composition
of a firm's top-management team (TMT)has received increased attention
(e.g., Fredrickson & Iaquinto, 1989; Hambrick & Mason, 1984), due in part to
the recognition that group decision-making contexts affect decision quality.
When TMT homogeneity fosters group cohesiveness (O'Reilly, Caldwell, &
Barnett, 1989; Wagner, Pfeffer, & O'Reilly, 1984), team members are more
likely to value mutual support and consensus above rational debate, reasonable conflict, and decision quality, resulting in the inadequate collection
and processing of diverse and conflicting information. The observation that
group processes can have a dysfunctional influence on individual decision
making when group members are too homogeneous or group norms foster
groupthink (Janis, 1972) suggests that increased TMThomogeneity can narrow the range of individual risk perceptions in the group.
Furthermore, the mean level of a homogeneous TMT's risk perceptions
is likely to be more extreme than the mean for a heterogeneous team.
topthe range of risk perceptions of a homogeneous
Specifically,
management team is likely to be more restricted than the range of risk
perceptions of a more heterogeneous TMT, and the phenomenon known as
"risky or cautious shift" (Stoner, 1968), which occurs in group decisionmaking contexts, suggests that the group will perceive either less risk or
more risk than its individual members. Although this phenomenon has
been examined only for group decision-making processes, the mechanism
by which this shift works is that it affects the risk perceptions of individual
members, leading them to perceive risks as more extreme than they otherwise would. Because many members of decision-making groups also must
make individual decisions, one might expect that such a shift in risk perceptions in a group context would transfer to the individual decision-making
context as well. That is, when an individual who is a member of a homogeneous team makes individual decisions, his or her risk perceptions will be
more extreme than the perceptions of a member of a heterogeneous group.

Also, Janis's (1972) groupthink hypothesis suggests that there is a tendency in more homogeneous groups to perceive consensual judgments as
correct. Although this idea has received extensive attention as a group
phenomenon, it has not received attention as a characteristic of individuals
making individual decisions who happen to be located in more or less
homogeneous work groups. Thus, it can be argued that the implications for
individual decision makers of past research on group decision making are
that:
Proposition 6: The more homogeneous the top-management team, the more its individual members will exhibit
risk perceptions that are similar and extreme; they also
will exhibit confidence in the accuracy of those perceptions.
Social influences. Individuals often rely on the information they gather
from others. Salancik and Pfeffer (1978) proposed that social information
processing was the root mechanism by which organizations and organizational members come to influence the perceptions, the beliefs-and,
ultimately, the actions-of individuals. It has been argued that organizations
are "strong situations" that tend to dominate other potential influences on
individual perceptions and behaviors (Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989; Snyder &
Ickes, 1985) by channeling individual attention and activity. Although there
are a number of potential influences, two of the most powerful sources of
social influence are the organization's culture and its leaders (Martin et al.,
1985; Schein, 1985). When individuals are socialized into the value system
and traditional practices of the organization, they can come to accept a
world view that frames their perceptions of routine and novel problem situations (Louis, 1980; Van Maanen & Schein, 1979).
Whether it is through fundamental values and beliefs or its more directly observable manifestations (e.g., risk-related rituals, stories, heroes),
the cultural risk values of an organization-which
may actually be a reflection of broader societal attitudes toward uncertainty-provide
important
guidelines for decision makers who find themselves confronting potentially
risky situations (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982; Hofstede, 1980). Organizational
members come to view their world through the lens of their organization's
culture, which can distort their perceptions of situational risks, sometimes by
or underemphasizing
risk. For example, Deal and
overemphasizing
Kennedy's (1982) typology of organizational cultures distinguishes organizations based on their orientation toward risk taking. Their description of the
"process" culture epitomizes bureaucratic risk aversion, which downplays
or even denies the significance of risk, and is illustrated with examples
drawn from government agencies or large, conservative corporations. In
contrast, Deal and Kennedy's "bet-your-company" culture (1982: 116-119)
fosters risk seeking by focusing on risk and encouraging individuals to actively seek out and identify potential risks. For example, 3M's emphasis on
continually trying out new and risky ideas is a core tenet of the firm's cultural value system and, as a result, this emphasis influences risk perceptions throughout the organization. Thus, for employees in which extreme

<-----Page 14----->22

risk seeking or risk aversion are clearly favored, situational risk will be
perceived automatically and unthinkingly, as the culture has, in effect,
pre-processed situational information. In contrast, when the culture's risk
orientation is more moderate, the individual decision maker must carefully
sort through the data, thus resulting in a more slowly processed, but more
accurate perception of situational risk.
Proposition 7a: Decision makers in organizations with
more moderate cultural risk values will perceive risks
more slowly but more accurately than decision makers in
organizations with more extreme cultural risk values.
Decision makers' perceptions of risk, as with other assessments of the
organizational context, are influenced by a number of additional aspects of
the social situation. Leaders are one of the most often cited sources of such
influence. Organizational decision makers know quite well who controls
access to the "fast track" and who makes critical judgments about candidates for advancement opportunities, and this knowledge can affect decision makers' risk perception by drawing attention to some aspects of risk,
while reducing the attention paid to other aspects. There are three ways that
leaders serve as role models for those who must judge how to approach
risky situations: by continuously directing attention to selected situational
attributes that are associated with high or low risk, by modeling how risky
situations should be handled, and by labeling or filtering information.
Nutt (1986), for example, reported that when executives exhibit speculative decision-making styles, their actions provide a vivid demonstration
for others that such behavior is possible and acceptable in the organization.
Various studies have suggested that higher level executives are not only
able to, but are also inclined to influence others to take risks (MacCrimmon
& Wehrung, 1986; Shapira, 1986). By clearly articulating personal preferences or by framing cultural traditions, a leader can signal what will and
what will not be rewarded. Even subtle cues from leaders about their preferences regarding risk can powerfully affect the risk perceptions of other
decision makers. If subtle influence attempts can be so effective, it is not
surprising that decision makers can be induced to advocate normatively
inappropriate levels of risk when the reward message is clear, and they
believe that such an approach is consistent with the organization's cultural
risk values (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982) and leader expectations (Schein,
1985; Wildavsky, 1988), or will enhance their career opportunities (Gaertner,
1988; Grey & Gordon, 1978).
Proposition 7b: Decision makers' perceptions of risk will
be consistent with the risk-related role models provided
by their leaders.
Problem domain familiarity. As opposed to risk history, which focuses
on outcomes, the familiarity that results from increased levels of past
experience in a given problem domain can affect risk perceptions independent of what outcomes resulted. Decision makers primarily learn through
experience (Levitt & March, 1988), and the lessons learned are reflected in

<-----Page 15----->1992

Sitkinand Pablo

23

both their standardized responses to routine stimuli and in their responses
to new stimuli (Mintzberg et al., 1976). Evidence suggests that individuals
often interpret new problems in terms of familiar problem categories
(Cohen, March, & Olsen, 1972; Dearborn & Simon, 1958) and unthinkingly utilize preexisting solution routines (Langer, 1978; March & Simon,
1958).
Although the learning and efficiency-related benefits of problem domain familiarity are clear, experience is helpful only up to a point. As
experience increases, decision makers are more likely to focus on their own
abilities and past successes rather than on current situational constraints.
As a result, they may simultaneously underestimate the actual risks involved in achieving success and overestimate their abilities to overcome
unforeseen problems (Jemison & Sitkin, 1986; March & Shapira, 1987). When
experienced decision makers overlook the inherent (Lewin, 1989) or underlying risks (Baird & Thomas, 1985)associated with a particular decision, they
can more easily attach unwarranted certainty to their understanding of
choice-specific risks (Slovic et al., 1980). That is, as experience levels rise,
overconfidence and a failure to appreciate the limitations of relevant competencies and available data may result in an illusion of control (Langer,
1975; Lefcourt, 1973).
A lack of experience can also have a number of detrimental effects. For
example, when a manager takes over an operation in an unfamiliar business area, he or she may apply well-established procedures and criteria,
even if they are largely irrelevant for or counterproductive in the new situation (Jemison & Sitkin, 1986). Furthermore, because experience informs
decision makers about information needs, a lack of relevant experience can
lead to incorrect assumptions or diagnoses. This reliance on familiar or
incomplete information will cause decision makers to be poorly calibrated
in their assessments of risk. Though some inexperienced decision makers
are likely to have less confidence in their assessments of risk, others will
naively exhibit overconfidence in those same judgments. In addition, when
decision makers lack prior experience, even modest additions to their data
bases can lead to dramatic shifts in their risk perceptions. That is, individuals with limited experience may be more likely to hold risk perceptions that
are strongly influenced by information that is available because it is the only
data point in that domain, it is recent, or it is vivid (Tversky & Kahneman,
1973).
Proposition 8a: Decision makers with moderate levels of
domain familiarity will have more accurate estimates of
risk and more moderate levels of confidence in the accuracy of those estimates than will decision makers with
high or low levels of domain familiarity.
Proposition 8b: Decision makers with moderate or high
levels of domain familiarity will have more stable perceptions of risk than will decision makers with low levels
of domain familiarity.

Organizational control systems. Organizational control systems can
foster perceptions of either high or low risk in a given situation because
what they reward and punish focuses attention on different aspects of the
decision-making process. Drawing upon Ouchi's (1977) conceptualization of
organizational control systems, two types of risk-related reward systems can
be distinguished: those that prescribe appropriate decision-making processes (process control) and those that reward outcomes by ignoring how
the decision was made, basing rewards only on how well the decision
turned out (outcome control).
Ouchi (1977) conceptualized process-oriented systems as focusing on
the evaluation and monitoring of ongoing behavior without regard for the
outcomes of that behavior. Under process controls, as long as a carefully
prescribed decision-making process is followed, no risk is involved for the
individual, even though the decision may involve risk for the organization.
Thus, it can be argued that control systems that reward the process by
which decisions are made will lead to perceptions of lower risk, at least
lower risk for the individual making the decision. Further, because institutionalized process controls tend to imbue decision-making procedures with
an aura of legitimacy and infallibility, it can be argued that individuals in
a process-controlled organization will perceive lower risks.
Outcome-oriented control systems, on the other hand, are hypothesized
to lead to perceptions of higher risk, at least for the individual making the
decision, because of the possibilities for both large individual rewards and
punishments. Because organizations, at least theoretically, can either emphasize or de-emphasize the use of one or both of these control criteria, we
propose that:
Proposition 9a: The greater the emphasis on process controls in organizations, the lower the level of risk perceived
by decision makers.
Proposition 9b: The greater the emphasis on outcome
controls in organizations, the higher the level of risk perceived by decision makers.

RISKPERCEPTIONSAND RISKPROPENSITYAS DETERMINANTS
OF RISKBEHAVIOR
Our review of previous work led us to suggest that risk perceptions and
risk propensity may best be viewed as mediating the effect of a variety of
other variables on risk behavior (see Figure 1). To this point, we have reviewed work that supports modeling these other variables as determinants
of risk perceptions and risk propensity (rather than as determinants of risk
behavior). In this section, we will examine theories and empirical results
that can help us theorize about the determinants of risk behavior-first by
examining the likely effects of risk perceptions and then by examining the
effects that risk propensity has on risk behavior.
The view that risk behavior is ultimately determined by the label at-

tached to a risky situation (i.e., risk perception) is informed by a number of
extant theories. For example, the major objective of prospect theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) is to predict an individual decision maker's
behavioral responses to different objective situational characteristics (defined by how the problem situation is labeled). Specifically, Kahneman and
Tversky and other researchers who have pursued this theoretical approach
(e.g., Singh, 1986) have found that situations which decision makers label
as positive (domain of gains) lead to conservative, risk-averse behavior,
whereas situations which decision makers label as negative (domain of
losses) lead to risk-seeking behavior. Empirical tests of prospect theory have
shown that positively labeled situations lead to more risk-averse behavior
than do negatively labeled situations.
As noted in our previous discussion of the determinants of risk perception, some studies have contradicted the theory and findings of Kahneman
and Tversky. Although no studies in the literature have reported a lack of
relationship between risk perceptions and risk behavior, studies have been
inconsistent concerning the sign of the relationship. Some scholars who
have focused on risk behavior in negatively labeled situations have not
observed the risk-seeking behavior predicted by prospect theory, but its
opposite. Even though some of these studies are quite influential, they have
not been previously juxtaposed against studies supporting prospect theory
and, as a result, the contradiction has not been recognized. One example of
results and theory that contradict prospect theory is the threat-rigidity hypothesis developed by Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton (1981). In the development of their hypothesis at the individual level, Staw, Sandelands, and
Dutton (1981: 506) suggest that the presence of threat results in cognitive and
motivational manifestations, such as reliance upon prior expectations, attention to dominant cues, and a tendency to emit well-learned responses
all of which are consistent with conservative, risk-averse behavior. Another
example is provided in Janis and Mann's (1977) identification of the hypervigilance response, a form of risk-averse behavior that results when decision makers perceive their situation in negative, threatening terms.
Examining positively labeled decision contexts, other scholars also
have come to conclusions that are the opposite of those posited in prospect
theory. For example, March and Shapira (1987) suggested that when conditions are perceived positively (e.g., when performance is well above a
target level), individual decision makers will focus on the opportunities inherent in those situations and, thus, will tend to be more risk seeking because their attention will be directed toward opportunities as a result of their
good fortune. March and Shapira's notions received empirical support in
Osborn and Jackson's (1988) study of the management of complex, dangerous technologies. Osborn and Jackson found that executives of utilities with
heavy investments in nuclear technology were more willing to take risks in
violating regulatory stipulations under conditions of gain (i.e., a history of
increasing prior earnings), than under conditions of loss (i.e., a history of
decreasing prior earnings). Similarly, based on their experimental finding

<-----Page 18----->26

Academy of Management Review

January

of increased risk-seeking behavior in the aftermath of prior gains, Thaler
and Johnson (1990: 659) suggested that "managers of profitable enterprises,
flush with initial success, will be more risk seeking."
Taken together, even this brief discussion of the extant literature highlights an apparent fundamental disagreement over the effect that risk perception can have on risk behavior: Prospect theory and its proponents provide support for a negative relationship between perceived risk and risk
taking, whereas other scholars suggest support for a positive relationship. Is
this apparent contradiction real or is it an illusion? Also, if it is real, can the
inconsistencies be reconciled?
One possibility is that the inconsistency is an artifact of the research
methods used. There are two reasons that the inconsistency cannot be dismissed so easily. First, the differences cannot be explained by separating
laboratory results from results obtained outside the lab, because support for
prospect theory has included both laboratory (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky,
1979) and archival studies (e.g., Singh, 1986). Second, this is not merely a
theories redistinction based on variations in empirical results-prominent
late to these two positions. Thus, it appears that these studies represent a
potentially important difference that will need to be resolved theoretically.
One theoretical approach for reconciling such apparent contradictions
(that also may avoid the need to reject one or more of these familiar and
frequently cited theories) is to identify previously unrecognized variables
that can help to explain the apparently contradictory results. There are two
general forms such a relationship can take. One possibility is to argue that
the risk perception/risk behavior relationship is contingent, in that hidden
moderator variables alter the relationship between perceptions and behavior. Another possibility is that risk perceptions are correlated with a previously unexamined variable that is actually driving the relationship.
We propose that the missing variable in this case is risk propensity. In
Figure 3, a way of reconciling the apparently contradictory results is illustrated by juxtaposing risk propensity (risk-averse behavior versus riskseeking behavior) with risk perceptions (positive situation versus negative
situation) to create four cells in which we put each set of research results.
Cells 1 and 4 in Figure 3 are consistent with prospect theory, whereas Cells
2 and 3 are consistent with its competing alternatives. The two essential
points here are: (a) that variation in perceptions of situational risk were
confounded in past work with risk propensity and (b) by more clearly distinguishing the perception and propensity dimensions, researchers can reconcile earlier findings. The accusation of confounded results obviously requires some explanation because some of these studies involved random
assignment, and the ideas presented here are speculative and have not yet
been subjected to empirical testing.
Consider first the characterization of prospect theory (Cells 1 and 4). It
is suggested that the findings of this research can be reconceptualized by
accounting for the risk propensity of the decision maker. Specifically, riskaverse decision makers are likely to exhibit low risk behavior under condi-

increased experimentation and risk taking (Sitkin, 1992); they also provide
subjects in the "domain of gains" with small success experiences that have
been argued to foster risk-averse persistence (Sitkin, 1992; Weick, 1984).
Thus, the use of random assignment is irrelevant to avoiding the problem of
confounded variables because it was the manipulation itself that simultaneously varied risk perceptions and risk propensity.
The placement of prior research into Cells 2 and 3 is also consistent with
characteristics of those earlier studies, even though risk propensity was not
the focus (or even explicitly considered) in all of the studies. Put simply,
studies that found low risk behavior (Cell 2) tended to examine more bureaucratic, risk-averse contexts, whereas studies that identified high risk
behavior (Cell 3) tended to focus on more entrepreneurial settings.
Those scholars who have studied responses to negative, high-risk situations (Cell 2) have tended to look at decision makers in government organizations (e.g., Janis & Mann, 1977), which have often been portrayed as
predominantly "risk averse" in orientation. Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton
(1981) focused in their research on studies conducted in similar organizational settings, including government agencies, universities, and large public companies. In addition, when looking at organizational settings, it is
quite likely that the three proposed determinants of risk propensity will be
congruent. That is, it is likely that in organizations that are risk averse in
orientation, large past failures (outcome history), historical use of inflexible
and risk-averse routines (inertia), and personnel-screening criteria (risk
preferences) converge, with the result that the subjects studied in such settings are more likely to have a risk-averse than a risk-seeking propensity.
The descriptions of the subjects studied by scholars who are representative of Cell 3 (see March and Shapira, 1987, for a review) imply a focus
on decision makers with a risk-seeking propensity. For example, the managers described by March and Shapira (1987: 1408) felt that an integral "part
of the business" of managing was the taking of risks and, indeed, high-level
managers encouraged others to take such risks. Though March and Shapira (1987) theorized about situations with high opportunities and suggested
why these opportunities would draw decision makers to be more willing to
take risks, their ideas and the research they review seems to apply most
directly to those who were more risk seeking to begin with.
It is acknowledged that the ideas just outlined amount to reasoned
speculation in that they focus on omitted variables in many of these studies.
However, we would argue that the interpretation of the theories and the
empirical results presented in this article is more consistent with the entire
body of work, taken as a whole, than are the interpretations offered in each
of the individual articles, taken in isolation. The overall implication of this
analysis can be summarized by referring to Figure 3 and noting that the
prediction for the four cells suggests that there is a main effect of risk propensity on risk behavior, but that there is no main effect for risk perceptions
(i. e., shown in Figure 3 as situational characteristics). This conclusion is also
reflected in Figure 1, in which the causal arrow from risk perception to risk

<-----Page 21----->1992

Sitkin and Pablo

29

behavior is a dashed one. A dashed arrow is used to indicate that this
relationship is suggested by past research, but it is one that (based on the
present authors' analysis) appears to be fallacious.
Although the analysis presented here highlights the problems associated with positing that perceptions affect risk behavior directly, the possibility of indirect influences of risk perceptions on risk behavior has not been
explicitly addressed. Although the review and reanalysis of past research
concerning risk perception (see Figure 3) may suggest that the present authors are unsympathetic to interaction effects, the analysis provides no reason to reject the possibility that risk perception moderates the effect of risk
propensity on risk behavior. To the contrary, the general argument made
here is quite consistent with the idea that the main effect of risk propensity
on risk behavior might well be strengthened as the level of perceived risk
rises. For example, individuals with a propensity to avoid risks are likely to
exhibit increasingly risk-averse behavior as perceived situational risk rises.
Conversely, individuals who are prone to seek risks might be expected to
exhibit riskier behavior as their perceptions of situational risk rise. However,
as opposed to risk-averse individuals (for whom it is predicted that the
exacerbating influence of risk perceptions would be monotonic), for riskseeking individuals it is expected that the link between propensity and behavior would be strengthened by higher perceived risk only up to a point.
The strengthening effect of risk perceptions on the propensity/behavior link
will disappear when the level of perceived risk surpasses some threshhold
level. This threshhold will be defined by the decision maker's risk preferences, inertia as an obstacle to exceeding his or her pattern of past risktaking behavior, and the level of risk implied by the outcomes of prior
risk-taking behavior. Thus, although the analysis supports rejecting the direct causal link between risk perceptions and risk behavior that has been
suggested in past work, it is suggested that perceptions may nonetheless be
an important influence on risk behavior through their moderating effect on
the relationship between risk propensity and risk behavior.
The proposed reconciliation of the dilemma of inconsistent results can
be summarized in terms of four components. First, apparently inconsistent
findings and theories can be retained as explanations for different conditions; therefore, these theories/results are not inconsistent, but complementary. Second, risk propensity represents a key explanatory variable that has
been overlooked in most of the previous research on determinants of risk
behavior. Third, interpretations of previous studies in this area erroneously
concluded that risk perceptions and risk behavior were causally related,
when their association was due to their shared association with risk propensity, an unmeasured third variable. Finally, risk perception is still an
important explanatory variable because it can help to explain variation in
individual risk behavior within the bounds generally defined by risk propensity. These four points can be summarized in the last propositions:
Proposition 10: Decision makers' risk behavior will be consistent with their risk propensities.

<-----Page 22----->Academy of Management Review

Proposition 11: The higher the level of perceived risk, the
stronger the association between risk propensity and risk
behavior, except that for risk-seeking decision makers
this effect will reach a limit defined by their propensity.

DISCUSSION
Contributions
Perhaps the most important contribution of this article is that, through a
simultaneous examination of previously unrelated streams of research, contradictory findings in the literature were identified that had not heretofore
been recognized. Although the preexisting fragmented state of research on
risk behavior was not conducive to readily identifying or resolving this conundrum, by juxtaposing these contradictory findings in a reformulated
model, the contradictory findings were reconciled and a more complete and
parsimonious theoretical model was proposed. The analysis presented in
this article thus advances the understanding of risk behavior by suggesting
that previous conclusions may have been incorrect and by pointing to the
potential importance of risk propensity.

Drawing together previously unrelated research streams. The model
of risk behavior proposed here builds directly on current theories of risk in
explaining individual risk behavior. Scholars have previously noted the
roles of problem framing (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), cultural risk values
(Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982), leadership (Schein, 1985), group homogeneity
(Janis, 1972), problem familiarity (Slovic et al., 1980), and risk preferences
(Brockhaus, 1980) as direct influences on risk behavior. Therefore, one contribution of this article is that it draws together these previously unrelated
streams of research and shows how they provide the foundation for a theoretical model of risk behavior that is more complete and accurate than
previous models.

A critical reappraisal of the role of risk perceptions and risk propensity. The proposed theoretical model argues for changes in how management researchers should theorize about and study risk. Previous work has
been criticized for positing associations among variables without presenting
adequate causal mechanisms. In response, this article is an attempt to move
theorizing about risk behavior forward by reconceptualizing the determinants of risk so as to make explicit and testable the underlying mechanisms
by which various organizational, situational, and individual factors could
come to cause risk behavior. More specifically, the list of factors that were
previously considered to have a direct influence on risk behavior are hypothesized instead to influence risk perception and risk propensity. This
implies that, in the future, scholars who wish to explore whether risk behavior is influenced by objective or perceived situational characteristics
need to take into account (or at least control for) the effects of risk propensity,
a criterion against which most past work does not measure favorably.

Identification of determinants of risk behavior not previously recognized in the literature. In addition to suggesting a basic reconfiguration of
our theories of the determinants of risk behavior, two new determinants of
risk propensity and two new determinants of risk perception have been
proposed: First, it is proposed that inertia and outcome history be included
as additional influences on risk propensity. Second, it is also suggested that
organizational control systems and risk propensity be considered as additional determinants of risk perception. Although all of these factors have
received attention in the organizational literature, a preliminary conceptual
foundation for their inclusion in future research on risk has been provided.

Empirical Implications of the Proposed Causal Model of Risk Behavior
One of the reasons for formalizing the proposed theory in the form of a
causal model is to facilitate cumulative empirical research in this area. In
part, this is in response to the observation that a great deal has been
learned within relatively narrow specialized subareas of risk behavior, but
that there has been relatively little integration across the historically discrete
theoretical perspectives. The ideas proposed in this article are meant to
provide preliminary evidence of the value of such cross-speciality research,
and it is hoped that this framework can stimulate additions, revisions, and
challenges to this analysis. For example, a great deal of prior work has used
risk propensity, risk perceptions, risk preferences, and other terms in a
nonsystematic manner. Some empirical research (Brockhaus, 1980) has
used different constructs for definitions, theories, and operationalizations
within a single study. By attempting to delineate more explicitly the different
constructs and theorize about their causal relationships, the goal here is to
provide a broader and more coherent framework for designing empirical
research on risk behavior that can clearly and effectively distinguish these
important variables.
The juxtaposition of different theoretical perspectives (e.g., Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979; March & Shapira, 1987) implies that future empirical research should not simply look at isolated cells in a two-by-two matrix, but
should vary fully both situational and dispositional dimensions to provide a
test of the ideas proposed here as well as the theories and empirical findings
on which they are based. As such, this paper responds to the call for the
development of models that can simultaneously examine the effects of both
dispositions and situations (Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989). In addition, it is
important for future empirical studies to reflect the operational complexity of
the construct of risk propensity proposed here, taking into account the importance of historical performance, inertial pressures, and individual preferences in a more systematic and valid way.

Future research at the organization level of analysis. There is another
promising extension that can be made from the framework proposed here.
We have focused on risk at the individual level of analysis and have derived
our propositions from individual-level theories and empirical research. How-

ever, many of the arguments developed here may be equally applicable to
organizations as decision-making entities. Thus, for example, one could draw
upon the work of Meyer (1982), Miles and Snow (1978), or Miller and Friesen
(1984) to examine the risk propensity of different types of organizations.
Future research on interaction terms. We could not examine in any
depth (nor could we even enumerate) the many plausible interaction effects
suggested by the model proposed in this article. This limitation, however,
suggests another way by which researchers could extend the ideas prothe theoretical evaluation and empirical testing of
posed here-through
possible interaction effects among the independent variables included in
our model. Researchers interested in specialized subareas of risk behavior
may wish to focus on smaller sets of variables so as to address the possible
interaction effects among them, thus adding complexity and richness to the
understanding of risk behavior.
To illustrate how the proposed framework could be extended by such
an effort, the following section provides several illustrative examples by
focusing on the potential interactive effects of organizational control system
characteristics and the three determinants of risk propensity included in this
model (i.e., risk preferences, outcome history, and inertia). First, consider
predictions that could be developed about an interactive relationship between control systems and risk preferences in influencing risk propensity.
Organizational settings in which outcome controls are emphasized will be
examined first. Individuals in organizations that use outcome-oriented control systems should exhibit a strengthened relationship between their risk
preferences and risk propensity. For those with risk-seeking preferences, a
focus on the opportunity to obtain greater rewards for successful outcomes
should fuel their inclination to take risks. However, for those with risk-averse
preferences, their tendency to avoid risks could be exacerbated by a system
that focuses on outcomes as a measure of performance. A different pattern
would be expected to emerge in organizations that emphasize process control, such that the relationship between risk preferences and risk propensity
would be dampened. That is, risk-seeking individuals have little incentive
for taking risks when large organizational payoffs do not yield large individual returns. Similarly, risk-averse individuals would be expected to have
a greater tendency to take risks when organizational failures are less likely
to result in individual sanctions.
The relationship between control systems and outcome history also provides an opportunity for further work. For example, it would be expected
that there would be a moderating effect of control system characteristics on
the relationship between outcome history and risk propensity. The basic
logic is quite straightforward-control
systems that focus on outcomes
should strengthen the influence of outcome history on risk propensity because this type of control system would continually draw attention to, and
reward or punish, the successes or failures resulting from a particular risk
propensity. In contrast, control systems that emphasize process criteria
should dampen this effect.
Finally, it could be argued that the effect of inertia on risk propensity is

<-----Page 25----->1992

influenced by control system characteristics. Specifically, we would anticipate that process-oriented controls, with their emphasis on the use of traditional procedures and routines, would be likely to reinforce the effect of
inertia by making it more likely that past patterns persist. In contrast, the
effect of outcome-oriented control systems is less clear. In part, the impact of
outcome controls will depend on the degree to which such controls represent a continuation of (or a departure from) past routines. If outcome controls
are inconsistent with traditions, then they are likely to weaken the effect of
inertial pressures on risk propensity because they energize new activity and
shift attention away from tradition and toward outcome-related influences
(e.g., outcome history).

Design guidelines for future empirical research. This article claims
that there are several attributes that comprise risk propensity and that these
attributes dominate situational features that were studied by Kahneman
and Tversky (1979), Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton (1981), and others. Furthermore, it suggests that the earlier findings were correct but misinterpreted because the contexts within which they were studied were too limited. This overall argument implies that management researchers need to
design more complex experiments to either capture or control risk preferences, outcome history, and inertia (i.e., the proposed determinants of risk
propensity) in order to simultaneously replicate these earlier studies while
testing the proposition that they attributed the differences incorrectly to perceived situational characteristics.
For example, a series of experiments could replicate the earlier studies,
but it could also explicitly manipulate the valence and scale of historical
experience, independent of perceived situational risk. It is unlikely that sufficient control of these naturally covarying factors could be obtained in the
field. Therefore, initial studies should involve controlled laboratory experiments, and field tests should probably be deferred at least until the patterns
of relationships have been clarified. In addition, future studies should also
vary the dispositional risk features of participants, to test whether or not
these features need to be retained in further work. An additional benefit of
including trait-like variables is that it would permit a test of whether our
conception of propensity as a current period tendency that is strongly influenced by history and inertia is, in fact, more useful than conceptualizing
propensity in more trait-like terms.

Promising Application Areas for Future Empirical Research
Two areas of application that have received a substantial amount of
attention in the existing research on risk are strategic management and
safety issues.

Application to strategic management research. By drawing attention
to historical patterns of organizational risk activity and the values of key
organizational decision makers (and of the organization's culture) with respect to risk, the proposed model could form the basis for useful departures
from past strategic management research, which has emphasized objective
measures of financial risk (e.g., Bettis, 1982; Shapira, 1986) and has ne-

glected the impact of behavioral or processable aspects of risk. One of the
most prominent topics of concern to strategic management researchers in
this area has been to understand the determinants of merger and acquisition activity. For example, risk propensity has been largely neglected as a
predictor of how an organization approaches the potentially risky merger
and acquisition process. In addition, the theoretical framework proposed
here offers a number of mechanisms by which the merger process itself
(Jemison & Sitkin, 1986) could influence how risks are perceived and how
they are acted upon during the course of a merger or acquisition.
Application to safety research. Much of the work to date on individual
risk behavior has focused on how individuals respond to potentially unsafe
conditions (e.g., Fischhoff et al., 1981; Kahneman & Tversky, 1984). However, this substantial body of work has focused attention on the role of
individual perceptions and preferences, with only limited consideration of
the potentially important impact of organizational context (e.g., Douglas &
Wildavsky, 1982) and personal and organizational risk history (Osborn &
Jackson, 1988). One potential contribution of this article to future work on
safety-related matters is to provide an expanded theoretical framework
within which to study these previously underemphasized determinants of
risk behavior.
Application to research on other issues. Although the bulk of past work
on risk in organizations has focused on strategic and safety-related risks,
there are other potential research domains that have not been addressed by
risk researchers to the same extent. For example, the theoretical model
proposed here could easily be applied to understanding the degree to
which organizational decision makers pursue more radical or more incremental innovations (Cardinal, 1990), depending upon their perceptions
about and propensity toward the risks involved. A second area of potential
application concerns how organizations handle sensitive information, by
exploring the influence of risk propensity and perceptions on the enactment
of organizational policies and practices concerning secrecy and disclosure
(Sitkin & Sutcliffe, 1991). Note that these two areas illustrate that risk can
include both positive (i.e., innovation) and negative (i.e., the loss of secrets)
risk-related behaviors.

CONCLUSION
A sizeable body of prior theoretical and empirical research appeared to
support the primary influence of objective or perceived situational characteristics on risk behavior. Yet the reconceptualization presented in this article suggests that this earlier work and the seemingly contradictory results
it generated can be explained by a theory in which risk propensity has a
dominant influence on risk behavior. By providing a single, integrated
model of the determinants of risk behavior, this article not only draws together and challenges the conclusions of a number of theories that have not
previously been compared, but also highlights opportunities for future theoretical and empirical work.
