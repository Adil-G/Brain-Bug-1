n both higher education and the world of business, constant
striving for improvement and excellence in one’s products and

services—be they computers, cameras, curricula, teaching, or
research—is widely accepted as an appropriate and fruitful strategy. Yet a relentless pursuit of ever-greater quality can lead to products that far exceed the performance needs of consumers and open
up a gulf between the two. Clayton Christensen, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, explains how this
gulf is often filled by disruptive technologies, which trigger important
changes in the basis of competition in
their field. After describing his theory
as developed in the corporate realm,
Christensen applies its principles and
lessons to higher education.

duction, sustaining innovations will move them up their
performance trajectory so that they become fully performance-competitive at some point.
Examples of disruptive technologies include early personal desktop computers (compared with more powerful
mainframes) and the small off-road motorcycles first introduced in North America by Japanese firms (compared
with Harley-Davidson and BMW bikes).
By and large, it is the least-demanding and least-profitable customers in a market who initially embrace a disruptive technology. Thus, most leading companies with successful, disciplined practices of listening to their best

small high-end segment of the market for managers. The
response of many leading corporations has been to look
elsewhere for managerial talent. Intel and Dell
Computer, for example, have announced that they will
no longer recruit at the Stanford Business School for
these reasons.
Corporate universities and in-house training programs are disrupting the leading business schools: In the
United States, the number of employees actively participating in in-house management development programs
is increasing by 30 percent every year. The number of formally organized corporate universities increased from
400 in 1990 to 1,800 in 1999. Eight times as many people are now receiving management training in a corporate
context than are enrolled in MBA programs. A significant
portion of in-house management training consists of
just-in-time, custom-assembled short courses that management development staffs put together to help specific
groups and teams work through specific problems.
At this point, corporate universities have opened new
markets in the lower and mainstream tiers by offering
simpler and more convenient programs. History has
shown, however, that such disruptive innovations typically expand the market dramatically and then migrate
inexorably up-market. Ultimately, they pin the original

becoming more and more out of touch with the mainstream and therefore increasingly irrelevant. Each institution’s goals and mission will necessarily evoke a different
response to this dilemma. What is critical, though, is that
the dilemma be recognized and actively addressed by our
nation’s leading colleges and universities.

Clayton Christensen is professor of business
administration at the Harvard Business School. His
book, The Innovator’s Dilemma (1997), received
the Global Business Book Award for the best business book published in 1997. In 1995 Christensen
won the McKinsey Award for the best article published in the Harvard Business Review.

Conclusion
The nation’s leading business schools are being disrupted
and must fundamentally rethink their business models if
they hope to thrive in the future. Although occupying the
highest tier is a worthy goal for colleges and universities,
campus leaders must also vigilantly guard against their
