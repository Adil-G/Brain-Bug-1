common task that is encountered by many disciplines, in
addition to usability engineering. Software tools have emerged
to assist in the performance of this task. These tools can be
roughly divided into two classes depending on their coding
philosophy or approach that they follow. Bottom-up analysis
tools are designed to assist in labeling the data with categories
and codes that can be modified on the fly, adjusting to the
content actually observed. In contrast, top-down tools assume
pre-existing codes or categories based on some theoretical
framework or taxonomy. This distinction between top-down
and bottom-up analysis caused considerable subsequent debate
between the founders of grounded theory [4] concerning the
issue of whether grounded theory is fundamentally a welldefined (top-down) coding paradigm, or a more ad hoc
(bottom-up) process of code assignment.

Abstract—We present the coding tool VPAT (Verbal Protocol
Analysis Tool), specifically designed to facilitate model driven
analysis of users’ verbal data. Such model-driven coding presents
challenges in terms of efficiency and reliability. Engineers and
researchers need effective means of coding with complex,
hierarchical, multi-level coding schemes. VPAT allows input of
customizable coding schemes, quick and easy insertion of codes
into text documents with a user-friendly interface, and extraction
of codes for analysis purposes. VPAT was developed for research
purposes with user-centered design methods with various
stakeholders. The VPAT prototype runs in conjunction with MS
Access and MS Excel. Comparative task analysis breakdowns of
main coding tasks in VPAT and a leading coding application are
presented to demonstrate advantages and tradeoffs. A case study
of coding usability data for a healthcare information retrieval
system is presented to demonstrate usage and benefits. VPAT is a
specific tool suited to model-based coding, and was shown to
increase speed and reliability.

Text analysis tools that are frequently used in content
analysis of usability think-aloud protocols such as NVIVO [5]
and MacShapa [6] tend to encourage a bottom up style of
coding. These and a number of other tools (AtlastTI,
HyperResearch, MAXqda, The Ethnograph) have been
compared based on available features [7]. All of the coding
packages are described to support “qualitative research”, which
tends to imply a bottom-up or grounded style of text analysis.
NVivo is the most widely-used coding support tool for verbal
text analysis. Hughes and Parkes reviewed two decades of
Verbal Protocol research and found a lack of software available
to support model-based coding with verbal protocols [8].

INTRODUCTION

Information gained from users or consumers is a key part of
engineering research and practice. For example, requirements
analysis is an essential early step in the engineering design
process [1], and requirements are frequently discovered using
techniques such as focus groups, interviews, and ethnography.
User feedback is often used to test design hypotheses and make
design choices, and certain classes of responses are expected.
Thus, users’ verbal data gathered through think aloud protocols
can be used to guide design or to verify models [2]. Verbal data
can be coded into categories to transform it into a usable form
for analysis. In engineering projects with specific design
models, a top-down (model-, or hypothesis-driven) approach
can be more powerful and appropriate than a bottom-up
(grounded) approach, where categories are created during
coding.

The bottom-up style of coding has the benefit of allowing
coding categories to evolve as the coding process continues but
at the cost of making codes somewhat inconsistent and
dependent on the order in which content is experienced and the
time at which it was coded. The resulting inconsistency in
coding tends to result in lower inter-coder reliability, when it is
measured, as well as adding error variance to subsequent
quantitative analysis of code frequencies in the coded data.
These issues can be dealt with by using a top-down coding
strategy, sacrificing some of the generality of a bottom up
coding approach in favour of a theory driven approach where
codes are presumed to be known in advance. Engineers, in
particular may benefit from a theory-driven top-down approach
to coding. Usability evaluation, for instance, has well known
usability heuristics and concerns (e.g., Nielsen’s Heuristics [9])

Usability evaluation with users is beneficial in the
implementation of human-machine systems [3]. Think-aloud
protocols inform designers on why, as well as how, problems
occur. The coding of text into categories or type of event is a

predetermined codes seems even more advisable in specific
domains such as usability engineering in healthcare. As an
example of this, Kushniruk et al [10] developed a coding
scheme designed to capture usability evaluation data from think
aloud protocols collected while using prototype healthcare
applications.

codes based on hierarchical relationships between higher and
lower level codes enables coders to recognize codes instead of
recalling them.
III.

We created a software tool VPAT (Verbal Protocol
Analysis Tool) to meet the coding needs concerning the
iterative usability testing a medical evidence-base resource, and
then expanded on this software to be suitable for general
model-based coding. VPAT allows input of unique coding
schemes, quick and easy insertion of codes into text documents
with a user-friendly interface, and extraction of codes for
analysis purposes. The following sections describe the
development and features of VPAT.

This paper presents the tool (VPAT), designed to facilitate
model driven analysis of user interfaces during the iterative
design and analysis of human-machine systems. We first
provide a more detailed account of the theory-driven, top down
approach to coding. We then introduce VPAT, and how we
designed the tool to ease the coding tasks associated with
model driven analysis of verbal text. We illustrate its benefits
using simplified task analysis breakdowns. Finally, a medical
case study illustrates usage and benefits of the tool.
II.

A. Design Motivations
The need for streamlining the coding process was born out
of the analysis for the Phase I usability study of a low-fidelity,
HTML-based prototype with search interface screens and
medical evidence based content [12]. The coding of the verbal
data from 15 participants (one 70-minute task-based usertesting session per participant) was time-consuming and led to
certain types of coding errors. Each transcript took
approximately 5 hours to code (Takeshita, verbal
communication, 2004). The coding scheme was complex and
hierarchical, leading to the placement of 3rd, 4th and 5th level
codes at incorrect levels, and to imperfect adherence to the
dependent hierarchy of certain categories. For example, the
attribute ‘pocketPC’ should logically be placed under the
category DeviceFormFactor, but not under Content; this
minimizes error and allows for straightforward coding
frequency analyses.

MODEL-BASED CODING

Verbal reports from think-aloud usability studies generate a
large amount of text. This text needs to be coded in some
manner in order to extract measures that can be analyzed and
tested in various ways. To meet this challenge, coding schemes
are created that capture the verbalizations relevant to the
researchers’ goals and hypotheses. Ericsson and Simon [11]
name this Model-Based Coding. A coding scheme is built a
priori, and the verbalizations that fit within that framework are
coded. For example, types of statements are distinguished.
1.

Intentions (goals, future states; recognized by verbs
“shall”, “will”, “must”, etc)

2.

Cognitions (information based on what is attended to;
recognized by statements indicating immediacy)

3.

Planning (possibilities; recognized by conditional
constructions like “if X then Y and if Z…”

4.

Evaluations (comparisons; recognized by key words
“no”, “yes”, “fine”, etc)

A complex set of hierarchical coding categories were
developed during Phase I for characterizing the system’s
usability and usefulness, based on previous research on medical
systems [10] and on the usability literature [13]. The scheme
included categories for subject comments regarding ergonomic
issues (e.g. interface consistency, navigation, response time),
usefulness and applicability of medical content (e.g.
comprehension of content, terminology, confidence of content)
and use of resources and information needs (e.g. resources
currently used, drug information needs). Numerous
subcategories were created under the main three categories and
revised to accommodate the data adequately. A single code in
the transcript consisted of six levels and was designed to
describe one coherent thought explicitly uttered by a
participant.

However, this is a relatively simple, 1-level deep coding
scheme. Figure 1 shows a portion of a relatively simple 2-level
coding scheme. Attributes, coding levels, and categories must
be added to represent all the features of interest in a usability
test to deal with multi-featured prototypes. In this scenario,
potentially hundreds of aspects of the interface could be
represented; for example, a website containing 20 pages with
30 elements per page. The difficulty of moving to such a
complex coding systems is that coders need to keep all of their
choices in memory when coding each statement, in addition to
hierarchical properties of each choice. One solution to this
challenge is to create built-in support for certain memory
subtasks of the coding process. For instance, showing relevant
E-mail

VPAT: THE VERBAL PROTOCOL ANALYSIS TOOL

Within the iterative cycle of the design of the medical
resource, the findings from the Phase I usability testing were
required to guide development of a revised prototype for Phase
II. Finding differences between groups of individuals suggests
opportunities or necessities for personalizing the presentation
of clinical evidence according to the type of individual using
that evidence (cf. [14]). Thus, moving to a larger sample size
created a particular need for efficiency for analysis using verbal
protocols in order to test hypotheses regarding quantifiable user
group differences.

<-----Page 2----->other advantage of drop-down menus is that they can change
dynamically to only reveal the codes that pertain to higherlevel categories. This feature addresses the problems of either
choosing codes at wrong levels, or of coding outside the
prescribed hierarchy of the scheme. For example, once a code
from level 1 is selected, only the associated sub-categories
shown in level 2 are displayed. Thus, the coders are constrained
to adhere to the pre-determined hierarchy. These problems and
design solutions are summarized in Table 1.

B. Requirements Analysis
Software requirements for the verbal protocol software
centred around streamlining the coding process used in Phase I
to increase efficiency for the larger scale Phase II analysis
(Figure 2). Two in-depth interviews with the two main Phase I
coders revealed the following areas for improvement. The
manual coding process was time-consuming. In addition to
typing in the codes free-form, coders ‘copied and pasted’ from
previous codes. The process of copying and pasting may
influence judgments. If only certain codes were visible to the
coder, he or she may be more likely to copy that code instead
of choosing a different code from memory. There were
inconsistencies in codes in that the same code would be used at
different levels.

C. Using VPAT
VPAT was built to support the series of tasks involved in
model-driven coding. The coding scheme is first defined using
a simple structure input into an excel file (the user manual is
available for syntax specifications). First, the text files are
loaded. Then, the transcripts are shown in the coding interface
(Figure 3). Blocks of text are coded by coders using the dropdown menus showing the user-defined coding scheme. Images
may be associated to the codes (Figure 4).

The image feature was important because images of the
content or experimental setup can provide context to
disambiguate the transcript text. For example, a participant
might point to an aspect of the screen and say “this works for
me, but I don’t understand these links”. Easy insertion of
capture screenshots provides context to understand those
statements during coding analysis. Reports can be generated
that can show text and the code frequencies.

Usability cycle and requirements gathering for VPAT system.

Two usability experts worked with one designer to
construct features that addressed the above problems. Specific
design solutions were proposed to solve the key problems
identified when looking at the manual coding process (Table
1). A simultaneous view of the text and of the available codes
addresses the problem of navigating through documents to cut
and paste the desired code. Thus, a portion of the screen would
be devoted to the text, another portion to the coding categories,
and a third portion to any images associated to the event.
Having pre-parsed text at critical punctuation points assisted
the coders in breaking up events (i.e., explicit statements
representing one coherent thought).
To address the problem of slow labor-intensive typing, or
cutting and pasting, a drop-down menu widget allows
recognition (and selection) of the codes instead of recall. The

for coding purposes and mentally selecting the section of text
to highlight are not included in the tasks analyses. For these
tasks, it is assumed that the coding scheme is already inputted
into the coding software. For the example presented in Table
2, the coding category is ‘usability’ within a one-level (flat)
coding scheme.

COMPARATIVE TASK ANALYSIS

VPAT and NVivo were compared to highlight tradeoffs
between the software designs. Two independent junior
industrial engineers completed the analyses [15] with guidance
from the authors. This section discusses a selection of the
findings. The team conducted simplified task analyses using
real transcripts and coding schemes. Key tasks were compared
using flat, small, medium and large coding schemes.

Table 2 highlights a slight benefit to VPAT over NVivo by
reducing the coding procedure by one step. The benefit
becomes more important when a large number of transcripts
are coded, with repetitive coding required. The dragging step
involved with using NVivo may cost the user more time when
compared to the clicking subtasks. VPAT was designed to
optimize this task by reducing the number of subtasks
involved.

Coding Schemes Used in the Analysis: The tasks analyses
for the simple coding schemes (flat and small) used simulated
coding schemes, such as the one shown in Figure 1. The
medium coding scheme was derived from research pertaining
to the design of an osteoporosis treatment decision-support
tool, and modeled after the large coding scheme described in
section III. The coding scheme was created by the primary
investigator of that project, based on the hypotheses of relevant
features and formatting concerns of the tool. The coding
scheme contains four levels. For example, level one consisted
of the categories: Usability, Content and Use/Needs. The two
subcategories under Usability were CDSSs (clinical decision
support systems) and OP-DMT (the abbreviation of the tool
under study). The third subcategories under the Usability
branch were Physical, Navigation, Interface and Data
Processing, and these code combinations could be qualified as
positive, neutral or negative (which consisted of the 4th level).
The transcripts that were coded from focus groups conducted to
discuss the development, format and function of the tool.
Further, the focus groups explored primary care and general
internal medicine (GIM) physicians’ understanding of disease
management and CDSSs; their perception of the facilitators
and barriers to using CDSSs. Lastly, the focus groups gathered
feedback on which critical features, functions, format, and
evidence are necessary to include in the tool. Further details on
the methods and results from this research will be available
from a manuscript in progress [16].

The second task that was analyzed using task analysis was
insertion of models (coding schemes) into the software. The
steps were counted to insert flat, small (two-level), medium
(four-level) and large (six-level) coding schemes, in both
NVivo and VPAT.
Creating a coding scheme in NVivo involves creating all
the nodes as either tree nodes or free nodes. If a code has more
than one level, the only way to create a hierarchical coding
scheme is through a series of tree nodes. To perform this task,
the user must start at the first level, and gradually build the
subsequent levels as branches off of the previous ones. The
process in which this occurs can be tedious when there are
numerous levels. The time consuming issue is that the
branching system for each node much be created separately,
even if the code is the same off several nodes. This creates a
substantial inefficiency for inputting complex, interdependent
coding schemes.
Creating a coding scheme in VPAT involves inputting
categories into a pre-defined excel worksheet. Repeated
subcategories can be entered into a list and pointed to by
multiple higher level categories.

The large coding scheme used for these tasks analyses is
the one described in section III of this paper. The reader is
referred to that section for details on the large coding scheme
and associated transcripts used in this analysis.

The numbers of steps for the coding scheme input tasks are
shown in Table 3. This comparison illustrates the increasing
benefit of VPAT when larger, more complex coding schemes
are used.

Comparison of Key Tasks: A simplified task analysis
procedure is used to broadly outline the steps involved in key
tasks associated with coding transcripts, for illustration
purposes. Factors such as target size, mental processing and
distance on the screen are not included.

The task breakdowns discussed in this section illustrate the
strengths of VPAT: insertion of larger hierarchical coding
schemes, and support for repetitive coding tasks. One of the
key tasks in bottom-up coding is insertion of new categories
into the coding scheme. VPAT does not easily support this
task; the user must edit the coding scheme via the excel file
where the coding scheme resides. The task analyses presented
in this section highlight how VPAT was designed to optimize
specific task needs of model-based coding.

The main task that is of interest is that of coding relevant
portions of text. The subtasks of navigating through transcripts

Regarding form-factor, a significant interaction with the
user groups and the ratio of positive to negative comments
occurred between devices (F[2,44]=4.94, p=.012). Residents
and general internists had a near-even ratio of positive to
negative comments for the tablet, while family physicians had a
higher ratio of positive comments towards the tablet. Residents
and internists had a higher ratio of positive to negative
comments for the pocketPC than family physicians. The
finding implies that family physicians preferred larger screens
and were less concerned about mobility, while internists were
most concerned about mobility. Residents presented the most
challenging design problem in their wish for both large screen
size and high mobility. These verbal protocol findings are
echoed in the exit questionnaire [19].

CASE STUDY

A health care study that used VPAT to code the transcripts
from user-testing sessions is used to illustrate the benefits using
the software, and also the types of results that it assists in
finding.
VPAT was used to analyze the verbalization from the 47
physicians that participated in the Phase II usability testing of
the prototypes. Physicians from three different user groups
(with different levels of medical expertise, varying degrees of
familiarity with evidence-based resources, and from two
different settings: urban and rural) were recruited to participate:
internal medicine residents; general internists; family
physicians. Participants completed 70 minute test sessions
which required that they work through scenarios relevant to
their clinical practice using the evidence resources provided to
them on the mobile computers. The sessions began with
participants completing an online background questionnaire
that collected demographic data (e.g. age, gender, type of
practice, year of medical school graduation) as well as their
exposure to evidence-based medicine, search engines, internet
databases and handheld devices. Participants were encouraged
to think-aloud as they browsed and searched through the
prototype's content looking for information relevant to the
scenarios (cf. [17]). See [18] for a detailed account of the
methods and results of this study.

Design Recommendations: A number of design
recommendations were indicated from the verbal protocol
results. The cells in Table 4 show a summary of the findings
obtained as they apply to each group of physicians. An ‘X‘ in
a cell indicates a requirement for further customization

Coding: A modified version of the Phase I coding was
input into VPAT. Two junior usability engineers independently
coded 15% of the transcripts. VPAT’s generated reports
facilitated quick calculation of inter-coder reliability, which
was satisfactory (kappa=0.73). Using the IDs as markers for
different portions of the text and codes, it was easy to scan for
differences and discuss them. Thus, the codes from each
transcript were compared and disagreements were resolved
through team discussion. The VPAT reports facilitated
identification of the coding differences, to target key problems
and identify patterns.

The following customization requirements may be inferred
from the verbal protocol analysis results in this case study:
•

Family physicians preferred some of the bottom-line
format of the content. They did not want to use the
small screen form factor.

A total of 2367 events were coded. The codes were then
merged with participant’s questionnaire data to allow for
statistical analysis.

•

Residents’ needs were met with the content as they
responded with more positive comments. They
wanted more screen real-estate for viewing.

The analysis of data was done in two stages. First, one-way
and two-way analyses of variance were conducted on
background variables, and questionnaire data. The second stage
of data analysis focused on quantitative content analysis.

•

General Internists were critical of the amount of detail
provided (they wanted more).

•

Both Residents and General Internists liked the
portability of the small-sized form factor.

Results: We observed significant differences in the
frequency of codes for content-related user needs. The groups
differed in their comments on the amount of detail of
information: family physicians and residents had a high ratio of
positive:negative comments (4:1) whereas the general
internists’ ratio was more even (1:1) (!2 [2]=12.06, p=.002).
This finding implied that groups had different needs for the
amount of evidence shown and the level of detail provided.
Some examples of coded comments: “Statistics would be
helpful because some issues are very individual and can't be
answered by evidence” and “It would be useful if drugs were in
a table, then we can have direct comparisons in specific areas”.
Family physicians preferred bottom-line guideline information
more than the other groups.

Process Overview: Analysis of verbal protocol transcripts
can be particularly revealing in developing customized
requirements. Code frequencies were compared between user
groups to uncover significant relationships. Overall, the
strongest group differences were observed for physician type,
with factors such as age, gender, and previous experience with
the Internet and medical databases having relatively little effect
on how the physicians responded to the prototype
implementations.
Phase I and II coders reflected on the time that it took to
code the 15-20 page text transcripts from the Phase I and II 70minute user testing sessions. On average, the Phase I coders
took 5 hours per transcript, including resolving disagreements

coding took approximately 2.5 hours per transcript, including
discussion of mismatched codes. The use of a more rigid

constrained possible disagreements within the coders

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

REFERENCES

VPAT demonstrates coding software designed specifically
to support a top down, model-driven method. Complex,
hierarchical coding schemes are easy to load in to the software,
and well-supported during the repetitive task of coding
segments of text. In VPAT, portions of the screen are devoted
to areas necessary for coding, allowing a persistent view of the
coding scheme. Statements are automatically broken up based
on speaker and length of text. These pieces of text are easily
coded using drop-down menus, which have been pre-populated
from the user-defined coding scheme.

A tasks analysis comparison between VPAT and the
leading coding software NVIVO revealed that VPAT reduced
the repetitive task of coding by one step, and facilitated
insertion of large, complex coding schemes. VPAT was
designed to optimize these key tasks in model-based coding.

[6]
[7]
[8]

Regarding the process of coding the user-testing session
transcripts, it was found that VPAT enabled shared discussion
of coding using the generated reports. The reports were easy to
scan and facilitated comparison between the coders, which
made the resolution of coding discrepancies more efficient.
Last but not least, when comparing Phase I (manual coding)
and Phase II (coding with VPAT), the time to code comparable
transcripts was approximately halved (2.5 hours compared to
about 5 hours).

The case study of the analysis of a health care information
retrieval system is an example for how coding verbal protocol
analysis can lead to identification of significant differences in
types of comments made during usability testing. The analysis
assessed the differential requirements of distinct subgroups of
users within a sample. These differences allowed the
identification of design requirements.

[15]

In summary, VPAT is a tool which was design specifically
to support verbal protocol coding, particularly model-based
coding with complex, customized coding schemes. VPAT was
iteratively designed to solve a number of issues that occurred
during manual coding using a large coding scheme, and tasks
analyses illustrate improvements in the efficiency in key tasks
involved in model-based coding of transcripts. VPAT supports
research using verbal protocol analysis, which can be
particularly useful in coding transcripts for usability or user
requirements verbal data.
