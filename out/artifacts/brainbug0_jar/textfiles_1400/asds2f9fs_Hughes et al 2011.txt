Management

Our research explores academic–practitioner engagement by undertaking interviews
with academics, practitioners, and other experts with relevant engagement experience.
The findings highlight the problem of thinking narrowly about the different ways in
which engagement takes place, as well as defining narrowly what is a worthwhile
activity for management academics. We develop a framework that encompasses the main
ways in which engagement takes place, and that relates these to different attitude
groups among both academics and practitioners. This could provide a starting point for
business schools and individual academics to develop plans and put in place the
processes for better engagement.

........................................................................................................................................................................
The relevance of academic research and teaching
to practicing managers has been a subject of debate for many years, with the discussion becoming
more intense in recent times (Bailey & Ford, 1996;
Bennis & O’Toole, 2005; Leavitt, 1989; Mintzberg,
1996; Pfeffer & Fong, 2002; Porter & McKibben, 1988;
Shapiro, Kirkman, & Courtney, 2007; Starkey &
Madan, 2001; Van de Ven & Johnson, 2006). Given
the persistence of this debate and the importance
of the issue to business schools, it is surprising
that there has been little research into the actual
ways in which knowledge passes between academics and practitioners in the management field.
Starkey and Madan (2001) point out that there are
no clear models relating to how management research is developed and disseminated between
academics and practitioners. Baldridge, Floyd,
and Markoczy (2004) argue that research is needed
to better understand the relationship between academic quality and practical relevance.
The link to practice is important because it is
about the question of how close academics are
able to get to the reality of management in their
research. If exchanges are limited to a small pro-

portion of the academic and practitioner communities, how are academics in general meant to
keep in touch with the reality of business practice?
Even academics with practical experience are
likely to lose touch pretty quickly from a lack of
field exposure. Younger or less experienced academics may lack the experience to operate effectively at this level, but how are they to develop this
experience and expertise?
Likewise, practitioners do not make the most of
management academics as a source of knowledge.
The significance of knowledge in relation to organizational survival (Kogut & Zander, 1992) and competitive advantage (Lyles & Salk, 1996; Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt, 2000) has long been acknowledged.
However, academics and their institutions compete with other knowledge sources and are only
one of many potential knowledge partners (Van
Wijk, Jansen, & Lyles, 2008). In this respect, practitioners have to make choices as to the most suitable partners in different situations. It could be
said that in a highly competitive world management academics do not “blow their own trumpet”
loudly enough.

The debate on academic–practitioner engagement within the academic community can be seen
to take place on two levels. On the one hand, it
raises fundamental issues of epistemology, relating to questions on the nature of scholarly work in
the management field. This was touched on in the
recent special section of AMLE that focused on
“Doing Work That Matters” (Bell, 2009), where the
discussion related to how scholarly work in management is recognized and rewarded. On the other
hand, the debate can also be seen to take place at
a very practical level, relating to understanding
the processes through which knowledge can most
effectively be developed and exchanged.
We review the debate from these two perspectives and discuss the implications of findings from
our research, which involved undertaking interviews with 68 respondents. They were chosen for
their involvement in academic–practitioner engagement and were made up of academics, practitioners, and other experts with relevant experience in the management field. We will commence
with a review of the debate concerning the academic–practitioner divide in management. In particular, this will be concerned with different perceptions over whether this is, in fact, a problem
that management academics should be concerned
about and the nature of the challenges involved.
Based on literature from across the management
disciplines, we argue that this is an important
epistemological issue for academics working in
the field, and we set out the aims of our research,
leading into an outline of our methodology and to
the research approach adopted. We then summarize our findings and open up a discussion on the
possible practical implications for those in the
management discipline who want to make their
scholarship matter in the wider world.
THE NATURE OF SCHOLARLY WORK IN
BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT
The question of academic–practitioner engagement is a basic one in relation to how the discipline of management science has evolved over the
past 30 years. Bennis and O’Toole’s influential
(2005) paper argues that business schools have
adopted an inappropriate model of academic excellence in order to gain credibility within the university environment, measuring themselves solely
by the rigor of their scientific research, thus becoming less relevant to practitioners. Broadly the
argument is as follows: Because of the need to get
academic status, business schools have become
overfocused on analytics and problem finding
rather than problem solving and implementation

41

(Leavitt, 1989; Porter & McKibben, 1988). Management is taught as a science rather than as rooted in
action (Bailey & Ford, 1996), and this has led to a
separation of management academics from the
management profession (Pfeffer & Fong, 2002). As a
result, much of the teaching and research carried
out in universities is irrelevant to the needs to
business (Beer, 2001; Bennis & O’Toole, 2005; Ghoshal, 2005; Mintzberg, 2004; Mintzberg & Gosling,
2002).
A major concern, for some, is that business
schools may lose their legitimacy in knowledge
generation if their research is seen as irrelevant
(Crowther & Carter, 2002; Huff, 2000; Starkey, 2001).
This could have potentially serious implications
for future funding and the healthy operation of the
sector. For those in the academic community who
believe that those who apply academic knowledge
are important stakeholders (Anderson, Herriot, &
Hodgkinson, 2001), the pervasiveness of the gap
(Rynes, 2007) can be a source of some despair.
However, there is a counterargument that warns
business and management academics of the dangers of moving too far to close the gap. Its essence
is that academic freedom is best served through a
degree of separation. If business schools are no
more than producers of commercially usable
knowledge, they stand to lose what makes them
distinctive (Grey, 2001). Business schools do not
exist just to serve the profession of management
(Starkey & Tempest, 2008), and much knowledge
emerges from fundamental research that is not
known to be useful at the time of doing the research (Weick, 2001). There is also the question of
power. Learmouth (2008), sees a threat to academic
pluralism from practice-based approaches that legitimize a particular elite view of the world. While
less has been published from those defending an
“arms-length” approach to practice, the acknowledgement of their concerns is important. We are
reminded that management research is a fragmented field in which there is little paradigm consensus (Tranfield & Starkey, 1998).
A useful contribution to this discussion is the
distinction made between explanatory sciences
and design sciences (Van Aken, 2004). The explanatory paradigm, as predominantly followed in
business schools, is concerned with understanding
what is, while design science (as predominates in
medicine and engineering) is concerned with what
should be. Design science is concerned with developing knowledge that provides answers to problems. Van Aken (2004) argues that successful
scholarship requires a partnership between the
explanatory sciences (where the output is a causal
model developed in controlled conditions) and the

<-----Page 2----->42

Academy of Management Learning & Education

design sciences (where the output is technological
rules developed in context). Achieving such a balance of scholarly quality and managerial relevance (Pettigrew, 1997) implies a reorientation of
the management field toward design science that
would emphasize work that is prescriptive, field
tested, and grounded in practice (Huff, Tranfield, &
Van Aken, 2006). Furthermore, the prescriptive approach can also be seen to involve a moral dimension, addressing Ghoshal’s (2005) critique of
business schools, by making it incumbent on academics to also focus on the impact of business
activities on the community (Huff & Huff, 2001).
THE SOCIAL PROCESS OF
ACADEMIC–PRACTITIONER ENGAGEMENT
At the heart of our argument is the view of knowledge creation as a social process (Amabile et al.,
2001; Nonaka, 1994; Tsoukas, 2005). A strong theme
in contemporary organizational thinking is to recognize that knowledge is socially constructed in
communities and is not confined to formal sources
of information or data (Lang, 2001). Knowledge cannot be seen solely as disembodied, formal, and
divorced from context (Blackler, 1995; Cook &
Brown, 1999; Lave, 1993). Knowledge creation involves learning through participation and interaction (Amabile et al., 2001; Nonaka, 1994; Tsoukas,
2005), and has been portrayed as a spiraling process of interactions between explicit and tacit
knowledge (Nonaka, 1994).
The body of literature on knowledge management emphasizes the perspective of organizations
as social communities specializing in the creation
and transfer of knowledge (Kogut & Zander, 1992).
An organization’s knowledge base is seen to be a
major source of competitive advantage. However,
sharing knowledge between communities can be
challenging (Brown & Duguid, 1998), particularly
where the knowledge to be shared is complex
(Hansen, 1999). An understanding of how to create
the conditions for effective exchanges of knowledge requires consideration of the soft factors in
communication between communities, such as the
degree of mutual understanding between receiver
and sender, and their underlying assumptions and
motivations (Guzman & Wilson, 2005). It is necessary to encourage individuals to interact, codify,
and share their knowledge internally to build the
firm’s knowledge base, as well as to interact with
external communities to access outside knowledge
(Birkinshaw, 2001).
The importance of social processes in knowledge creation is pertinent to the way the problem
of academic–practitioner engagement is ap-

March

proached. Where the gap is framed in terms of
being about knowledge possession, the failure is
understood to be about ineffective transfer of academic knowledge (Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart,
2003). However, Van de Ven and Johnson (2006)
argue that it can be a knowledge-production
problem, requiring a two-way coproduction of
knowledge between academic and practitioner
communities. Shapiro et al.’s (2007) research with
Academy of Management (AoM) members found
that they support the argument for both ways of
framing the problem. That is to say, while poor
communication to practitioners is an issue, the involvement of practitioners in creating knowledge
is equally important. This conclusion supports
Tranfield and Starkey’s (1998) argument for the inclusion of mode 2 approaches in producing management knowledge.
The generally poor level of engagement between
academics and practitioners, highlighted in the
literature, is therefore of concern because social
interaction is so fundamental to knowledge creation. The absence of sufficient direct interaction
between these communities means that there is a
lack of the dialogue and debate that is essential
for the effective development of the discipline.
Rynes’ (2007) message is pertinent here. Academics
should seek interaction with practitioners despite
the possible tensions involved, because interaction is so fundamental to knowledge creation.
THE NEED FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF
ENGAGEMENT
Criticisms regarding the quality of engagement
between academia and practice are not restricted
to the organization sciences. Gibbons et al.’s (1994)
influential ideas on mode 2 knowledge production
apply to the whole landscape of science and technology. In mode 2, the social context of knowledge
production is crucial. In contrast to the mode 1
science push model, mode 2 is based on an interaction model, emphasizing the relationship between researchers and users at different stages of
knowledge production, dissemination, and utilization (Nowotny, Scott, & Gibbons, 2001). It is very
difficult to make meaningful comparisons between
business and management and other disciplines,
and therefore, we would not claim that business
and management is either better or worse than
other fields of study in relation to engagement.
What seems to be important is that one of the key
defining characteristics of business and management research is its applied nature (Tranfield &
Starkey, 1998). It therefore fits well into a mode 2
approach.

<-----Page 3----->2011

Hughes, Bence, Grisoni, O’Regan, and Wornham

There has been a certain amount written about
the need to involve the practice community in designing and undertaking management research.
Shrivastava and Mitroff (1984) argued that by consciously formulating research questions in terms
of managerially controllable variables, researchers would be more likely to obtain results that
prompt actions. In doing this, cooperation with
companies becomes a prerequisite for the production of actionable knowledge rather than an outcome (Hatchuel, 2001). Some empirical evidence
suggests that practitioner–academic partnerships
can lead to better management research and its
greater utilization by practitioners (Amabile et al.,
2001; Landry, Amara, & Lamari, 2001). Suggestions
for achieving this include the setting up of partnership teams (Cyert & Goodman, 1997); practitioner
participation in interpreting research (Amabile et
al., 2001; Mohrman, Gibson, & Mohrman, 2001); and
the involvement of practitioners in problem formulation, theory building, research design, and problem solving (Van de Ven & Johnson, 2006).
There is also an established model that considers the triangular relationship between teaching,
research, and practice, with two-way relationships
between each of the three elements (Kaplan, 1989).
Burke and Rau (2010) have recently argued that
better integration of teaching and research would
be beneficial to narrowing the academic–practitioner gap.
However, there remains the fundamental question, as articulated by Shapiro et al. (2007: 262): “Is
creating a more continuous two-way dialogue between researchers and practitioners doable?”
While there has been much research in recent
years in the general field of interorganizational
knowledge transfer (Van Wijk et al., 2008), there is
a knowledge gap relating to understanding the
process of development and exchange of knowledge between academics and practitioners and
their organizations (Rynes, 2007; Shapiro et al.,
2007; Starkey & Madan, 2001). For those management academics that agree with Adler and Harzing’s (2009: 91) view that “academia needs to shift
to designing and implementing environments that
purposefully encourage research that matters,”
what needs to be done to improve the processes
through which academic–practitioner engagement
takes place?
The research reported here starts to explore engagement by interviewing academics and practitioners who do engage with each other. We review
the evidence on the social practice of engagement
and consider the various routes through which engagement takes place in relation to knowledge
transfer and knowledge exchange. This leads to a

43

discussion designed to add to the current debate
on how to create conditions likely to improve
engagement.
METHODOLOGY
The specific objective of the research reported here
is to better understand academic–practitioner engagement. The following research questions and
subquestions provided the starting point for our
research:
1. What are the practices and processes associated with knowledge development and exchange between academics and practitioners?
●
●
●
●

How is knowledge exchanged?
How effective and efficient are the different
methods of exchange?
What are the triggers and barriers to knowledge exchange?
What characterizes good and bad practice?

2. What are the characteristics and behaviors of
academics and practitioners who engage with
each other?
• What are the attitudes of those involved in engagement activities?
• How do they view the use of theory in the practice of business and management?
• How do practitioners view academics and viceversa?
• How do they think their colleagues view this
type of engagement?

The interviews were semistructured, based
around a framework designed to ensure that they
covered common areas. The starting point for each
interview was to get the interviewees to start talking about their experiences of academic–practitioner engagement. In doing this, we aimed to allow
the interviewees to go into as much depth as they
wanted in their areas of particular interest. An
interview guide was used by the interviewer to
ensure coverage of aspects not spontaneously
mentioned by the interviewee. The interviews
were all conducted by the authors of this paper,
with each author interviewing those within their
own field of expertise.
In managing a diverse team of researchers, it is
crucial to put in place sufficient research protocols
and processes to ensure dependability and confirmability of the findings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
The first named author provided continuity across
all subprojects. There was careful control of the
way the data was collected, coded, sorted, and
analyzed (Miles & Huberman, 1994). All interviews
were recorded and transcribed. The NVIVO software package was used to facilitate the analysis,
and this proved valuable in handling a large

<-----Page 4----->44

Academy of Management Learning & Education

amount of data. The first named author of the paper conducted all coding in close liaison with the
academics who had conducted the interviews.
Through controlling the coding and analysis process in this way, it was possible to compare and
contrast responses concerning common issues
across the range of interviews.
In undertaking this research we took a critical
realist approach. The critical realist perspective
allows for pluralism of perspectives in looking at
complex phenomena, where different views exist
(Van de Ven, 2007). It is well established as one of
the major research paradigms (Guba & Lincoln,
1994), taking the point of view that there is a real
world to discover, but it is only ever imperfectly
understandable (Godfrey & Hill, 1995; Tsoukas,
1989). Critical realism allows for the independent
existence of the social world made up of abstract
ideas (Magee, 1985). Within this paradigm, indepth interviewing, as used in our study, is considered to be a very suitable method for probing into
a complex social phenomenon (Healy & Perry,
2000). Furthermore, qualitative approaches investigating perceptions are recognized to have value
in understanding the complex area of knowledge
and learning (Sammarra & Biggiero, 2008).
The research covered here comes from interviews conducted by the authors in the United Kingdom across the marketing, accountancy, strategic
management, and organization studies disciplines. Business and management contains a number of different fields, and there is no universally
agreed definition of the disciplines that should be
included in this area. However, the four disciplines
focused on here reflect core subjects offered in
most business schools, and most importantly, reflect the range of expertise represented by the authors. In conducting interviews across a number of
disciplines, we considered it essential to have expert interviewers who research and teach within
each discipline chosen. The cross-disciplinary
makeup of the team had many advantages in widening the research rather than constraining it
within one discipline. The four disciplines chosen
represent a range of relationships with practice.
Accountancy is highly professionalized, with the
professional bodies controlling the license to practice. Marketing and strategic management are less
controlled. Professional bodies exist, but practice
is not confined to members of these professional
bodies. Organization studies is at the other end of
the continuum from accountancy, with its emphasis on the study of organizations, rather than the
professionalization of practice.
A purposive sampling approach was taken,
through selection of interviewees relevant to the

March

processes being studied (Denzin & Lincoln, 2002;
Mason, 1996) that were well situated to illuminate
the issues (Gerson & Horowitz, 2002). Thus, our aim
was not to provide a sample that represented all
academics or all practitioners. Our respondents
were individuals who were approached because of
their involvement in some form of academic–
practitioner engagement. The interviewees were
contacted through the extensive network of contacts of the authors of this study. The network was
then extended by “snowballing” from the initial
respondents, in order to identify others who were
suitable (Mason, 1996; Patton, 1987). The interviews
that took place, within each discipline, broke down
as seen in Table 1.
The Appendix provides brief descriptions of the
role and responsibility of each interviewee, demonstrating their suitability and credibility for involvement. Selecting interviewees on the basis of
their credibility and expertise in the area of research is a well-established practice (Marshall &
Rossman, 1989), that puts an emphasis on the validity of the research through getting close access
to the phenomenon under study (Gummeson, 2002).
The other aspect of the sampling approach was to
gain perspectives from different stakeholders in
the management field. Hence we interviewed academics (20 interviews), practitioners (28 interviews), and consultants/experts (20 interviews).
The consultants/experts group consisted of commercial consultants, senior staff from professional
bodies, and expert commentators not directly falling into either the academic or practitioner groups.
The consultants/experts group was included because its members could give third-party perspectives from a position outside of either academia or
practice. The interviews were either conducted
face to face (40 of 68) or over the telephone (28 of 68).
As a research team, we took the approach of
analyzing the data throughout the research program in an iterative process, building our understanding progressively from the interview data, as
it became available. Following in the spirit of this

approach, our discussion of the findings below
also contains a significant amount of analysis as it
progresses. The authors believe that the project
benefited by following this iterative process, and
assessing the significance of what was said by the
research participants as the research evolved. The
authors’ collective experience of the politics of
practice and academia was found to be invaluable
in this.

THE PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH EFFECTIVE
ENGAGEMENT
As a starting point, we will summarize the different
ways in which, according to our interviewees, engagement occurred. We call these “routes to engagement” and illustrate them in Figure 1.
Most of the routes through which engagement
can take place are self-explanatory. One route that
perhaps does require a little explanation is that of
“knowledge networks.” We found a number of examples of formal and informal networks that had
been set up expressly to provide a means for engagement. One of the most successful has been
running for over 13 years, providing an industry
forum within a particular sector. It involves major
organizations from the sector, academics working
in the area, and policy makers and regulators. One
participant, “Acmar3,” puts its continuing success
down to very active management and a willingness to evolve in order to provide continuing value
to its members:

45

I am just about to start a program of spending
three or four months visiting all of our members . . . I act as the primary catalyst for
change, but we do make it our business to get
a lot of feedback from our supporters. Acmar3
The network mentioned is quite formal, involving a
significant level of funding from its members.
Other examples from our research were less formally structured. “Acmar1” has been running his
own knowledge network for many years, relating
to information technology and customer management, providing a range of opportunities for academics to present ideas, and gain up-to-date insight into the challenges faced by practitioners.
Like the previous example, Acmar1 makes the
point that running a successful network takes considerable effort and the skills to liaise with a number of different parties.
Figure 1 also features two major intermediaries
(commercial consultants and professional bodies),
identified in our research. These intermediaries
can be seen to act in conjunction with the main
routes to engagement, to a greater or lesser extent,
within different management disciplines. For example, within the accountancy discipline, where
the professional bodies are particularly powerful,
they often play a “bridging role,” setting relevant
agendas for teaching and research:
It needs an intermediary and I think we can
do that because, you know, we are talking to

FIGURE 1
Routes of Academic–Practitioner Engagement

<-----Page 6----->46

the academics and we’re sort of thinking
about issues like Measurement, like Reporting Models for Business, where we know that
practitioners are interested, we know that
there are also academics who are doing relevant work and so we can bring the two sides
together. Conacc8
Professional bodies often play an important role in
commissioning research, allocating funds for research by academics, and in setting up joint research committees where academics and practitioners can work together. From an academic’s point
of view, as well as funding for research, a professional body can provide a number of opportunities
for practical research.
The other major intermediary route to engagement is commercial consultancy. “Conmar2” considers his training consultancy’s link with a leading UK business school to have been very
important in setting the business up, enabling the
consultancy to keep abreast of academic developments. An academic from the business school supplies the body of knowledge, and the consultancy
concentrates on its application. Equally, the training consultancy, in interacting with its clients,
sometimes picks up on the development of new
problems and issues before the academic community. Other consultants that we interviewed also
acknowledged the benefit of having access to the
latest academic research, in one case through taking an MBA, and in another case through taking a
DBA. In these cases the consultants concerned are

March

playing an important translation role, that of making relevant academic theory usable in the context
of their clients’ particular problems.
It is when we consider the ways in which each
route can be said to effectively enable knowledge
transfer or exchange, that the results become most
interesting in considering the practice of engagement. Providing evidence that learning has actually occurred through engagement is problematical (Easterby-Smith, Lyles, & Tsang, 2008), and this
is where the in-depth probing that is possible in
qualitative research is particularly valuable in developing understanding. In analyzing the interviews we have adopted the distinction between
transfer (relating to one-way communication of
knowledge) and exchange (relating to two-way
knowledge creation), as used by Van de Ven and
Johnson (2006) and Shapiro et al. (2007). Table 2
summarizes our findings in this regard.
The “Courses and Programs” Route
At the undergraduate level, the recruitment of recent graduates can be seen as an important source
of bringing up-to-date theory into practitioner organizations, as illustrated by this quote from a
partner in an accountancy firm:
I think you will see it coming in through the
bottom. . . . partners tend to be dinosaurs and
our job is to understand the commercial drivers of our clients, not necessarily the latest
theory or the finest points of financial report-

ing. That actually comes in from the machine
behind us. . . . it sort of feeds in at the more
junior levels and goes up into the firm that
way. Pracc11
At the postgraduate level the knowledge transfer
link will tend to be more direct. Prmar1 found that
a part-time MBA provided him with models that
helped him simplify real business problems and
solve them. Many of these were simple models that
people within his organization (one of the largest
global blue-chips) were not aware of. For Conmar3,
a recently completed MBA served to remind him
of the basics and refresh his thinking. However,
embedding the learning from courses and programs in organizational practice is often not that
effective:
It needed the organization to actually understand that knowledge was critical to its future, and it needed the university to understand that working together with the business
was critical to its future, and it didn’t quite
work that out. Conmar5
The knowledge transmitted through “courses and
programs” is often theoretical, and across a wide
range of contexts; therefore, it needs to be selectively and appropriately adapted to the organizational context.

The “Research” Route
Research, in itself, can be a route to engagement,
where it involves the researcher as an agent of
change rather than purely an observer, as is the
case with participative types of research, such as
action research. Participative and collaborative research is particularly encouraged in some management disciplines. Where this is the case, this
type of research has the potential to offer both
knowledge transfer and exchange, covering
knowledge that is applied and context specific.
However, there are many fields of management
where participative and collaborative research is
discouraged by lack of inclusion in top-ranked
journals and, in turn, by audits of research quality.

The “Publication” Route
Across the management fields we studied, one of
the most consistent findings was that practitioners
seldom read academic journals and when they do,
they are put off by the language, content, and style:

47

Academics tend to write for themselves in
arcane journals, and even if an MD is given
one, he/she would not want to read past the
first page. The articles are often shown to
demonstrate what the academic knows rather
than what is useful to someone doing the job.
Constrat16
Few small business managers read academic
journals. . . . (they are) too busy to bother with
what they see as high-level theory, and are
more content to attend trade conferences and
exchange information between themselves.
Constrat18
A summary of the views expressed in the interviews is that academic journals are inaccessible to
practitioners because of their language, style, and
poor readability, and there is a need for translation
to distill the information into a meaningful and
relevant framework. While popular business publications disseminate information much more
widely, they have a limited role in disseminating
academic research, often are seen as the domain
of journalists, and as containing few articles from
academics. We did speak to editors concerned
with hybrid journals that specifically try to appeal
to both practitioner and academic audiences, but
in these cases the practitioner component had
proved difficult to sustain. There are exceptions,
such as the Harvard Business Review and some
publications from the larger consultancies. However, a fair summary of our respondents’ views is
that there are few common publication arenas
where academics and practitioners debate or
share knowledge. The point here is that potentially
useful research knowledge is not effectively transmitted. There is, perhaps, a need for the development of more academic management writers, who
can effectively engage with, and excite the interest
of, the broader business and management
population.

The “Conference” Route
This problem of lack of common areas where academics and practitioners might maintain a dialogue was also evident in the interviewees’ comments on conferences. While we did find examples
of conferences set up by academics for both communities, it can be difficult to attract large numbers of practitioners. In particular, the input from
academic speakers needs to be credible and relevant if attendees are to feel that they have gained
value:

<-----Page 8----->48

Academy of Management Learning & Education

You have to know that what you are providing
is something they will find of value, and if
you haven’t done your homework you really
aren’t up to speed with what is going on in
professional practice, they will crucify you.
Acmar4
Conferences do have the potential to facilitate
both knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange, but in reality there are few that truly attract both parties. Achieving the presence of both
parties at conferences is problematic. It is crucial
that the subject matter is of mutual interest, raising the issue of how much common ground the two
parties actually share.
The “Knowledge Networks” Route
Formal or informal knowledge networks exist in
order to share information between members. In
the accountancy field, where there are strong professional bodies, we found little evidence of networks involving both academics and practitioners
outside of those provided by the professional bodies. In contrast, in the marketing field, where the
professional bodies are weaker and less formal,
networks can play an important role in academic–
practitioner engagement. These networks would
seem to provide great potential for social interaction between the academic and practitioner communities, and hence, may be very important for
cocreation of knowledge. This route focuses on
knowledge that is applied and pragmatic, often in
very specific contexts. However, successful and
long-term networks are said by our respondents to
be few and far between.
The “Consultancy” Route
At their best, academic consultants were seen as
capable of making a very real contribution to practice, through widening the intellectual resource
available to the client, bringing an objective expertise, and acting as a knowledgeable facilitator.
In order to get in this position, the individual academic needs to have the track record and ability to
undertake direct consultancy. For this reason academics invited into the company or organization
will tend to have significant industry knowledge
rather than simply theoretical knowledge. The academic’s ability to apply theory requires an understanding of the company or industry context. However, the idea of the academics as “experts” runs
the risk of putting them on a pedestal, and treating
them in an unquestioning manner, as a kind of
guru. Acmar1, an academic who has had a long

March

and successful consultancy practice, stressed the
importance of engaging with practitioners on an
equal footing. He believes academics should take
part in:
frequent in depth consulting, in which you are
looking at the issues and arguing the toss,
and not behaving like a guru, but as a peer
amongst senior people where you are open to
be questioned. Acmar1
Conducted in this way, consultancy carries the
potential for knowledge exchange and sometimes
provides opportunities for joint publication and
conference presentations with practitioners. The
nature of the knowledge exchanged tends to be
applied and pragmatic and related to a specific
context. However, the consultancy route posed the
most ethical dilemmas for academics in relation to
their own independence and the motives of the
client for using them. Furthermore, commercial
confidentiality may pose restrictions on wider dissemination of knowledge gained through this
route.
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ENGAGEMENT
Within the academic community, individual attitudes toward working with practice seemed to reflect the lack of consensus revealed in the literature. However, in analyzing our interviews we
discerned three distinct attitude groups that might
be worth further investigation. First, we found
many academics that engage with practice as a
matter of course and believe that it is fundamental
and greatly enriching to their scholarship:
I think the thing that gives me the greatest
satisfaction as a researcher is when people
actually use the research I have generated; or
you go to a practitioner conference, and there
are two or three speakers referring to research that I have done; or they are using the
model that I taught in the past. Because you
know you are making a practical difference.
Acmar4
There is a kind of, a sense of an underlying
value which revisits from time to time, and
one is unconscious of. It relates to beneficial
change, social benefit, making a difference,
making a positive difference. Acorg16
We would characterize these as the “Willing &
able” group of academics, who currently do work
with practice, having both the experience and

<-----Page 9----->2011

Hughes, Bence, Grisoni, O’Regan, and Wornham

the motivation. At the same time, many of our
interviewees mentioned individual academics
that do not wish to engage with practice, some of
whom believe that this should not be part of their
role. We would characterize this group as the
“Theoreticians,” who have no wish to engage
with practice:
If I look around . . . I mean I think there is
unwillingness, a simple unwillingness,
(among) many of my colleagues to want to
communicate to the sorts of issues and problems that many practitioners really face,
sadly, you know. Acorg13
I think there are a few people, quite a minority, who would look with disdain on the world
of practice. I won’t name names, but there are
one or two . . . but they look askance at people
in practice in principle, because they think
it’s contaminated, caught up with capitalist
values and they are out really to provide critique of that whole system, so they look
askance at any kind of involvement of practice. Acorg14
Alongside these polarized views, our research suggests that there is also a third group of management academics, who are not strongly negatively
disposed to working with practitioners, but only
have limited opportunities to do so. We classify
these as the “Willing, but underexposed” of those
who would like to engage more, but lack the experience. In this respect, the credibility of individual
academics in engaging with practice emerges as
an issue:
I think that there’s a credibility issue . . . The
credibility of the academics for the practitioners. You know the practitioners see the academics as removed from it; from the action as
it were. Acacc8
Another barrier is to do with source credibility: beyond Harvard and a few others academics have little credibility in the business
community . . . Too often delivery is by people
without exposure to industry. Acstrat19
I think part of that lies in the fact that although many academics in marketing, for example, are fully engaged with industry,
they’re interested and so on, they perhaps
lack the confidence, or indeed the connections, or practical experience to actually criticize. Acmar1

49

And the other thing we have learnt is that the
academic community has difficulty in very
practical terms in presenting its work to the
practitioner community. Acmar3
This raises the question of how younger management academics learn to deal with the practitioner
community:
The general culture in most universities as I
see it is you eat what you kill and you go out
and make your own way, and it’s a very individualistic culture. There’s no sense of the
collective, you sink or swim as a young researcher. Acmar5
Following from our research we would suggest
that it might be useful to consider academics
within the management field in terms of these
three segments in relation to engagement: The
“Willing & able”; the “Theoreticians”; and the
“Willing, but underexposed.”
On the practitioner side, in terms of attitude and
motivation we also found distinct groups. We have
called these the “Enthusiasts,” the “Uncommitted,”
and the “Cynical.” Because of the nature of our
sample, many of the practitioners that we interviewed had embraced academia and been proactive in developing links. We would characterize
these as “Enthusiasts” in relation to engagement.
For example Prmar1 had been involved in a number of academic–practitioner networks in his senior management role, within a multinational blue
chip company. Prmar1 related how education had
been a continuous process for him as he developed
in his career:
I think we are unusual people in the way we
work, and other people rely on us to be information brokers. I am not quite sure how this
has come about, but it does go back a long
way . . . But I wanted to keep learning, so I did
HNC computer studies and BCS exams and
I’ve never stopped. So then I did a Diploma in
Accounting & Finance and, of course, the
MBA, and I did the marketing . . . . I’ve never
stopped . . . . So it’s a continual selfdevelopment program. There are people like
this, I know other people like this, but they are
not the norm.
As Prmar1 notes, his experience is not typical and
for the great majority of practitioners the immediate demands of their role seem to take priority over
ongoing development. For this reason, we suggest
that there is a group of practitioners who we call

<-----Page 10----->50

Academy of Management Learning & Education

the “Uncommitted,” who may be open and sympathetic to academic work, but do not maintain these
links on an ongoing basis because of other
priorities:
I find it quite challenging just to get through
the necessary technical reading. There’s only
so many hours in a day. I get to work, I don’t
know seven thirty in the morning, leave seven
o’clock at night. Sometimes work much later.
And somehow within that working day, and
there’s not really a slot for it, I have to update
myself with all the technical material. Pracc8
What you get there is a lot of people who’s . . .
and this happens all the time in corporates,
their nose is down at the grindstone and
churning out charts for management meetings, and they never get any downtime, they
never get to step back and think about where
this is going. Acmar5
On the other hand you have got industry,
which over the last 10 or so years has become
ever more focused on bottom line short-term
profit. And so, the pace within industry keeps
quickening up and, in part, technology has
driven that. People’s days are being driven by
emails for example and the technology, in my
judgment, far from making business more efficient and effective, is in many ways making
it less efficient. Because there is less proactive management of executive time and more
reactive usage of executive time. So this adds
to an overall culture in which short-term activity, fire fighting, becomes ever more the
norm. Acmar3
As a result of these pressures practitioners often
seem to require simplistic answers to complex
problems:
From the practitioners view they want silver
bullets as they avoid complexity. When the two
sides are not even talking on the same plane,
then communication is impossible. Constrat 16
I sympathize with the emotion that lots of practitioners feel, that they want a list, they want it
to be simplified, but it cannot be so. Acorg17
As suggested by this last quote, simplification may
not be possible and desirable, and therefore, the
academic needs to find more practitioners like
Prorg15, who are prepared to be open in their
thinking:

March

Exactly right, exactly right! It’s challenging
my thinking. That to me is the key thing for
me, going out talking to you guys, because I
can go in this direction and no one will challenge me in the organization apart from “we
can’t afford to do it.” Prorg15
Targeting those who are attitudinally likely to respond positively is crucial:
I would say possibly 20-30% of the people
really got fired up about new ideas and they
are basically just creative tools to enable
them to think in a different way. They got
really fired up about it. The rest actually
thought it was a waste of time, a waste of
their time, because they had to be focusing on
their business plans, which is quite interesting, isn’t it? I suppose that’s what I mean by
you have to pick your people to sometimes
apply more theoretical concepts. Conmar5
Three segments of practitioners are suggested by
our research: the “Enthusiasts” as epitomized by
Prmar1 above, who actively embrace links with
academia; the “Uncommitted,” made up of those
who may be open and sympathetic to academic
work, but do not maintain these links on an ongoing basis; and finally a group who may be closed
to academia and academic ideas. We call these
the “Cynical.”
As exemplified by our research, there are many
academics engaging with practice and a number
of practitioners who are open to engagement. The
problem is not that academics and practitioners do
not engage with each other. The problem is the
narrowness of the engagement, being generally
limited to those we term as the “Willing & able”
academics and the “Enthusiast” practitioners. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the challenge is about
depth of engagement on both sides.
The solid arrow represents the existing relationship between the “Willing & able” group of academics and the “Enthusiast” group of practitioners.
The arrows with the dotted lines illustrate the areas for potential development, with the “Uncommitted” group of practitioners and the “Willing but
underexposed” group of academics. The “Enthusiasts” seem to be open to academic ideas and prepared to pick and choose between models and
ideas, selectively applying those that they identify
to be relevant. This group would seem to be more
open to routes to exchange, such as courses and
programs, that offer exposure to theories and more
general concepts. In contrast the “Uncommitted”
and “Cynical” groups would seem to be more

<-----Page 11----->2011

Hughes, Bence, Grisoni, O’Regan, and Wornham

closed to theory, where it is not seen to be relevant
to their immediate context and particular challenges. The “Uncommitted” group in particular
might be more likely to respond to engagement
routes that emphasize pragmatic knowledge development related to specific contexts, such as a
knowledge network or a consultancy program.
ENGAGING APPROPRIATELY:
THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT ROUTES
Our review of the effectiveness of knowledge
transfer and knowledge exchange, across the different routes, touches on many of the reasons for
the lack of effective academic–practitioner engagement. As depicted in Table 2, every route has
its own limitations, and therefore, we conclude
that engagement needs to take place across multiple routes in order to be effective in relation to
different practitioner segments. This includes
routes outside of traditional teaching and research, which provide greater opportunities for social and informal interaction. In our research, we
found a number of successful knowledge networks,
where a common feature was that academics had
taken the lead in working with a range of practitioners and policy makers, in developing common
agendas for future research. A network can also
provide a means to access research subjects
among network members and a forum for disseminating and discussing the implications of the research results. In this, the academic can overcome
the limitations of the inaccessibility of traditional
publications to the practitioner community by
translating, synthesizing, and interpreting the results. At the same time, we would not want to paint
too rosy a picture. Other research has pointed to the
complexities and uncertainties of such collaborations (Alteroff & Knights, 2009), and our research

51

found that they tend to break up easily. Therefore we
should not underestimate the skills and resources
required to maintain successful engagement.
Achieving impact outside of the academic community generally requires participation in routes
that inevitably involve close interaction, as well as
the building of relationships between academics
and current practitioners. This requires a design
science approach (Van Aken, 2004, 2005) in so far as
the practitioners involved will be interested
mainly in knowledge that is valid to field problems. The practitioner view on the appropriateness
and applicability of the content of academic management research needs to be taken into account.
Others (e.g., Bailey & Ford, 1996; Guest, 2007) have
stressed the importance of the relevance of subject
matter to practitioners’ immediate needs. Mode 2
(Gibbons et al., 1994) approaches to knowledge
generation recognize that knowledge development
takes place iteratively, with a series of interactive
exchanges between the parties involved. Our research points to ways in which effective engagement can be established, for a much more balanced and two-way interaction that provides
demonstrable value to both sides.
At the same time, our research suggests that if
engagement is to be effective, it is also crucial to
identify the right people on both sides, as illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, we argue that it is
important to distinguish between academics that
might feel compromised by engagement (Grey,
2001; Learmouth; 2008), whom we have called the
“Theorists,” and those that have had little opportunity to engage, the group we have called the
“Willing but underexposed.” Arguably, it is this
group where the most effort needs to be made, in
order to support them in working with practice. It is
this latter group that would benefit most from

FIGURE 2
Engagement by Attitude Group

<-----Page 12----->52

Academy of Management Learning & Education

training, support, and mentoring. On the practitioner side, the focus should be on the “Enthusiast”
and “Uncommitted” groups.
We therefore propose that a useful framework for
considering academic–practitioner engagement is
to focus on the two key elements of (1) the right
people (by attitude), and (2) the routes through
which they engage, as illustrated in Figure 3.
We believe that the strongest engagements take
place where “Willing & able” academics engage
with “Enthusiasts” across a large number of different routes. Greater depth of engagement between
the communities will be achieved where “Willing
& able” academics are able to engage more “Uncommitted” practitioners, through more use of unconventional routes such as knowledge networks.
But, most important for the future, the “Willing but
underexposed” group of academics needs carefully controlled involvement across a wide range
of routes if we are to develop a bigger group of
“Willing & able” academics.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
As established at the commencement of this article, there is widespread concern among academics
across business and management disciplines
about the academic–practitioner gap. Much has
been written about the problem, but little about the
lessons to be learned where engagement is taking
place. The contribution of our research is to put
forward a framework that encompasses the main
ways in which engagement takes place and relates these to different attitude groups among both
academics and practitioners. As with all qualitative research, we must acknowledge its limitations
in terms of generalizability. Our purposive sample
of 68 interviewees, all undertaken in the United
Kingdom, produced a wealth of valid and interesting data. However, the reader must judge the applicability of these findings in different contexts
and cultures.
Through analyzing the routes by which academics and practitioners may transfer and exchange
knowledge with each other (see Tab. 2), the poten-

March

tial limitations of overdependence on any single
route are exposed. This highlights the problem of
thinking narrowly about the different ways in
which engagement can take place, and defining
narrowly what is a worthwhile activity for management academics. From a practical point of
view, the map of routes to engagement (see Fig.
1) could provide a starting point for business
schools to develop strategic plans and put in
place the processes for better engagement. Our
research suggests that business schools need
strategies that address multiple routes and recognize the varying needs of different attitudinal
groups among practitioners. Nontraditional
routes, such as knowledge networks and consultancy, may well be necessary to reach new
groups of practitioners, such as the “Uncommitted” and the “Cynical.”
The development of relationships with practitioners does not happen automatically. This raises
the point about ways in which business schools
and their academic staff can be most effective in
reaching out to the various communities that they
serve. While we found some individual academics
that had intricate webs of practitioner and policymaker relationships, there would seem to be the
potential for business schools to be more proactive
in broadening and deepening the links and involving many more academic staff in this. To do so will
require significant investment of time and resources on the part of individuals and institutions.
Again, the will to make this investment will depend on individual and institutional motivation, in
relation to the perceived importance of crossing
the academic–practitioner divide. Our research
suggests it is not as simple as putting effort into
reaching out into the practitioner community, in an
attempt to create relationships and communities.
We found many examples where considerable effort had been put into these types of initiatives
with disappointing results. If attention is not given
to encouraging and developing academic staff that
are “Willing and able,” and to providing training,
support, and mentoring to less experienced academic staff (“Willing, but underexposed”), the ini-

Hughes, Bence, Grisoni, O’Regan, and Wornham

tiatives will fall flat. Similarly, better understanding of different practitioner attitude segments is
essential, in order to focus efforts on those practitioners who are potentially receptive.
The map of routes to engagement (see Fig. 1)
could also provide a framework for individual academics planning how to undertake and disseminate their own research. This is a potentially important finding, in so far as it relates to the debate
about the functionality of existing academic assessment systems. The focus on academic publication, as the single metric of performance (Adler &
Harzing, 2009; Seggie & Griffith, 2009), is further
exposed as an inadequate way of encouraging and
rewarding scholarship in a field such as management where the theory–practice link is so much a
part of what makes it distinctive (Tranfield & Starkey, 1998).
As a source of knowledge for practitioners, academics do bring potential benefits. First, academics are not usually using their knowledge as a
means to sell other products or services. This academic objectivity is potentially valuable to practitioners seeking advice that is unencumbered by
vested interest. Second, the academic perspective
comes from outside the “rough and tumble” of dayto-day business concerns and can insert a healthy
skepticism into any analysis, going beyond the
latest fad or fashion. Third, the management academic has skills in teaching and learning that can
contribute to creating behavior change. Fourth, the
academic often has access to his or her own networks and colleagues, providing a wider source of
expertise, drawing from areas such as the social
sciences, humanities, and liberal arts (Starkey &
Tempest, 2008).
We would argue that, too often, these benefits
have not been communicated to the vast majority
of practitioners, and we are left with unhelpful
stereotypes. One stereotype is of the ivory tower
academic, out of touch with practice. Another is
of the professor as an all-knowing guru. This
latter view can be seen as an uncomfortable
conspiracy between practitioners, who are looking for expert help in solving difficult problems,
and academics, who want to boost their credibility, and perhaps earnings, in the consultancy
arena. A more realistic and mature relationship
of equals is required, one based on a recognition
that many questions in business and management are complex and deep. Practitioners will
not always get the easy answers that they would
like, but working with business and management academics can be very fruitful in deepening understanding and facilitating change.

53

FURTHER RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
A next step on from our exploratory research
would be to conduct a more comprehensive investigation into attitude groups; among both academics and practicing managers. Our findings
are based on the perceptions of those, on both
sides, who are currently involved in some form of
engagement. A fuller investigation could provide
evidence from wider sample populations of academics and practitioners. For example, do academic “Theoreticians” see themselves as such?
Are most practitioners negative about academia
(members of the “Cynical” attitude group) or just
waiting to be convinced (members of the “Uncommitted” attitude group)? It would extend our
understanding to quantify the size of the different attitude groups and understand their relationships with demographic factors, such as age,
experience, and gender. Within the academic
community, we would speculate the existence of
links between career factors, such as previous
employment outside of academia and attitude,
but this needs to be empirically tested. On the
practitioner side, we would expect there to be a
link between education experience (such as having taken an MBA), and attitude toward links
with academia. Furthermore, other factors, such
as size of the practitioner’s organization or type
of business sector, might be expected to have an
impact on propensity for engagement and on
capacity to engage. International comparisons
may also be particularly informative in identifying factors that promote or discourage engagement across cultures.
Further work is needed to test the relationship
between the use of different routes to engagement
and the attitude groups on both sides. We would
hypothesize a positive relationship between a positive attitude to engagement and the use of multiple routes, and a negative relationship between a
negative attitude to engagement and the use of
multiple routes. Furthermore, the knowledge network route would seem to be worthy of specific
research because of its strong association with
many of the cases of effective engagement that we
found in our research. Of particular interest would
be the relationship between academic–practitioner networks and wider knowledge networks (Van
Wijk et al., 2008). This would provide interesting
perspectives that would contribute to extending
our understanding of interorganizational knowledge transfer and exchange, in general, as well as
in the specific area of academic–practitioner
engagement.
