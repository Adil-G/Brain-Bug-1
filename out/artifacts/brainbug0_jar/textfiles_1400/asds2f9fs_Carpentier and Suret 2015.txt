Abstract
This research note analyses the investment harvest expectations of a large Canadian angel group.
These angels co-finance large high-tech deals; on average, greater than CAN$1.2m. Canadian low
listing requirements and the junior stock market make the initial public offering a possible exit
mode. However, angels prefer a trade sale, consistent with the proposition that large acquirers
can fully and rapidly exploit innovations and offer better exit values. Securities regulation impedes
initial public offering exit; reluctance to pursue this exit strategy however, increases with angel
experience. The classical funding escalator, including venture capitalists, no longer appears to be
a dominant model.

Introduction
This research note explores how business angels expect to harvest their investments and the reasons for such choices. The exit of angels from an enterprise constitutes an important underresearched question. Recent surveys of angel group activity find that the ratio of exits on investments
is low; so in Scotland for example, it is 4 percent (Mason et al., 2013) and in Canada, 5.8 percent
(National Angel Capital Organization, 2013). This implies that angel money is locked up in portfolios, which in turn, can have negative effects on the financing of emerging companies (Mason
et al., 2013). In order to determine what be done to unlock these funds, a better understanding of
angel harvesting strategies is required.
Three recent interrelated observations reinforce the relevance of analysing business angel exit
strategies. First, the angel market is changing. According to Freear and Sohl (2012), Sohl (2012)
and Gregson et al. (2013), angels are increasingly acting in groups and moving away from

providing seed financing towards investing larger amounts in projects. If angels move from seed
funding to a later stage of financing, their perspective on exiting the enterprise is likely to evolve
in concert. As Mason et al. (2013) have noted, prior research has largely ignored this market trend;
so the current operations and investment activity of angel groups remains unknown.
Second, practitioners have urged angels to rethink their exit strategy (Gray, 2011; Peters, 2009).
Harrison et al. (2010) have observed that the investment model of Scottish angels rests largely on a
‘cradle to exit’ approach. Angels are increasingly exiting through trade sales; that is, selling their
whole stake to another firm or private investor over a short period. This could result in the premature
sale of local firms to foreign interests, to the detriment of the regional economy (Mason et al., 2013).
Thus, venture capital (VC) investment is no longer necessary to reach an initial public offering (IPO).
Third, the decline in IPOs in North America and the UK has become a real concern for policymakers, and the exit strategy of private equity investors requires attention (IPO Task Force, 2011;
Mason, 2011b). This note is based on a survey of angel group members, and is organised as follows: the next section summarises the angel exit strategy and states the propositions. The survey
and the respondents are then presented, followed by the results. The final section presents the
conclusions and implications for future research.

Business angels’ exit
Classical perspective
The common wisdom is that angels invest after the personal finance of the funder and the ‘love
money’ run dry, but that the size of investment is well below the minimum deal sizes considered
by VC funds in seed and start-up businesses. The volume and connections of VC funding then can
lead the start-up to an IPO (Ibrahim, 2011), representing an important source of follow-on funding
for angel investment (Amatucci and Sohl, 2006). Even if the typical angel-funded deal is too small
for the issue of an IPO to be considered, angels may maintain their investment and participate in
subsequent financing and exiting (Freear and Sohl, 2012). Bruton et al. (2009), DeGennaro (2012),
Goldfarb et al. (2012) and Wiltbank (2009) report that angels participate in the IPO market less
frequently than VCs, although their rate of participation remains significant. This ‘funding escalator’ no longer functions effectively (Mason et al., 2013) probably because the angel, VC and IPO
markets have changed significantly during the last decade.
Since the 2001 downturn, VC funds have shifted investments away from early-stage ventures to
focus almost exclusively on more mature and less risky opportunities (Pierrakis and Mason, 2008).
Thus, the relationship between angel investment and VC funds has become more complicated
(Amatucci and Sohl, 2006), and angel-financed firms have had greater difficulty in attracting subsequent rounds of funding (Mason et al., 2013). Hellmann and Thiele (2013) show that the ‘hold-up’
problem for angels at the VC stage may encourage angels to exit early, in order to avoid VC funding.
Simultaneously, a growing number of angels have grouped themselves into various formal and
informal structures (Gregson et al., 2013; Mason et al., 2013; Sohl, 2012). As its structure has been
strengthened, the angel market has facilitated the implementation of co-investment funds and a
focus on post-seed investing (Sohl, 2012). Angel willingness and capacity to finance follow-on
rounds is growing, as demonstrated in Canada (National Angel Capital Organization, 2013),
Scotland (Mason et al., 2013) and the USA (Sohl, 2013). The cost of starting up information and
communications technology (ICT) businesses, which account for 54 percent of the Canadian angel
group of investees (National Angel Capital Organization, 2013), has also decreased, enabling
angels to intervene just before commercial feasibility (Mason et al. 2013). The conjunction of the
focus on a later development stage and the larger resources available in angel groups enable angels
to finance some firms up to exit, bypassing VCs.

<-----Page 2----->584

Since 2000, the number of IPOs has decreased in the USA (IPO Task Force, 2011), Europe
(Mason, 2011b) and Canada. To tackle this evolution, the USA IPO Task Force (2011) advocates
a scaled regulation approach for smaller issuers. In Europe, EnterNext was launched to make the
equity market attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Both proportional regulation and junior stock exchange have existed for decades in Canada. Therefore, analysing the
Canadian situation of angel exit is particularly interesting. Canada enables firms to access a venture stock exchange at an early stage of development (Carpentier and Suret, 2012); in addition,
the main stock market is easily accessible. The median gross proceeds of firms listing on the TSX
venture exchange (TSXV) from 1997 to 2011 were CAN$1.6m, close to the total amount of
Canadian angel deals, and most firms list before reporting any revenues. Backdoor listings are
also very common. Thus, Canadian angels in groups face a real choice between financing a venture up to an IPO, or using another exit mode. The survey reported in this article aims to determine
their preferred exit mode, and why. It posits three non-exclusive explanations for the exit choice:
the strategic dimension, the increasing regulatory burden of small public companies and market
conditions.

The strategic dimension
The economies of scope hypothesis is grounded in the observation of a ‘gradual structural change
[that has been] going on for the last few decades that favours big firms at the expense of small
firms’ (Ritter, 2013: 8). Ritter contends that getting big fast is increasingly important, mainly in
the technology industry, as a consequence of globalisation and improvements in communication
technology. The strategy whereby a small independent company grows by using its own
resources, and ultimately makes an IPO, is less advantageous than the alternative strategy of
growing big fast (Ritter et al., 2012). Acquisition by a large company that can exploit innovation
fully and rapidly then becomes the optimal exit strategy (Gao et al., 2012; Merrill, 2009; Ritter,
2011). From the angel viewpoint, such a trade provides a higher return than an IPO because a
small innovative company is worth more as a part of a large organisation than as a single entity
(Gray, 2011). For Peters, ‘the optimum strategy for tech start-ups today is to design the company
… so everyone is aligned around the idea of a company acquisition in the under $30 million
range’ (2009: 32). If angels do endorse this perspective, the following propositions should be
verified:
P1: Business angels prefer trade sale exit to IPO exit.
P2: Business angels prefer trade sale exit for strategic considerations that are in line with the economies of
scope hypothesis.

Regulation and market structure
The IPO Task Force (2011) links low IPO frequency to the cumulative effect of different regulatory
actions that have increased the costs of going public and reduced the amount of information that is
available to investors. In the USA the cost of an IPO is currently $2.5m, and annual ongoing compliance costs are estimated at $1.5m (IPO Task Force, 2011). Oesterle maintains that ‘the high cost
of IPOs depresses venture capital in the United States’ (2006: 369). If securities regulation is a
strong deterrent to IPO exit, angels should agree with the following proposition:
P3: The requirements, delays and costs induced by securities regulation are a primary deterrent for an IPO
exit.

<-----Page 3----->Carpentier and Suret

Market conditions
Since the burst of the internet bubble, the long-run performance of IPOs has been poor in the USA
(Ritter, 2011) and Canada (Carpentier et al., 2010). Such poor returns are likely to deter any investment in new IPOs. Furthermore, the level of listing requirements on the TSXV is low: firms generally list at an early stage of development before they can report any revenues. As a consequence,
both their liquidity and their following by analysts are very low. This could create a reputational and
liquidity effect, and account for the difference in valuation between the Canadian and US markets.
This study attempts to determine whether angels agree with the following proposition:
P4: The reluctance to exit via IPO is explained by poor perception of the Canadian venture exchange.

Why should experience matter?
In a given angel group, members are likely to differ in terms of background and experience. If
entrepreneurial experience is required to join the group, most members should have exited from
their own firms. However, seasoned angels who typically have significant investment experience
should have more extensive knowledge of the intricacy of exiting than less experienced investors.
This study expects that angel investment experiences will influence their perspectives on exit.
Experienced angels are more likely to have analysed the pros and cons of exit modes, and to have
contended with the intricacies of securities regulation. Accordingly, the following proposition is
posited:
P5: Business angels’ perspectives on exit differ based on their angel investment experience.

Method
Respondents and data collection
Using the internet, 110 members of a large Canadian group1 were surveyed from 18 October 2012
to 20 November 2012. This organisation fits the description of a formally organised group (Shane,
2005) or formal angel alliance (Sohl, 2012). It has a paid manager and staff, including a gatekeeper
(an angel). The organisation has a budget partially granted by the government, a website and a
physical location. The staff do the basic screening of deals and manage logistics while the group
has regularly scheduled meetings. Members have to pay significant annual fees (CAN$2,500) and
be approved by a committee that checks their entrepreneurial background and the willingness and
ability of new members to help investees. The members must be accredited investors according to
securities laws, holding either net assets of at least CAN$5m, or financial net assets higher than
CAN$1m. According to the group’s CEO, 95 percent of members are former, or serial entrepreneurs, who have exited successfully from one or several ventures. Each member is responsible for
their own investment decisions based on their personal investment criteria, and there is no investment committee.
The group’s CEO first explained the research objective to members during their monthly
meeting in September. The group’s team then sent an email to each member with a link to the
survey; two reminders were emailed subsequently: one during the October meeting, and another
in November. The study received 35 answers: a response rate of 32 percent. The questionnaire
addresses angel characteristics, perspectives on exit, the strategic and regulatory dimensions of
their work and perceptions of the stock market. Answers are mostly given on an ‘agree/disagree’ scale.

All but four respondents had made previous angel investments. We believe that the virgin angels
had entered the market already because they had an entrepreneurial background and were actively
involved in a costly and time-consuming approach to investments by attending the group’s meetings, presentations, training and discussions. In total, 35 percent of the respondents had more than
12 years of angel experience and 31 percent had been investing for two to 12 years. Eleven angels
(32%) had invested in more than 10 firms, and 11 more (32%) in four to 10 firms. Therefore, most
of the respondents were experienced angels, but 12 (35%) were relatively new. Most members (27)
had never exited an IPO as an angel investor. Three angels had exited an IPO once, five had exited
twice or more, and one had exited four times. Approximately one angel in four had experienced an
IPO exit as an angel investor. The total number of IPOs reported is 17.

Results
General perspective and strategic dimensions
The angels were asked: ‘After making a private investment in high-growth firms, which exit mode
is better?’ In all, 51 percent of the respondents thought that a trade sale was better (Table 1). Only
17 percent would make an IPO exit choice. This indicates a clear preference among respondents
for a non-IPO exit.
Overall, the respondents linked the decline in IPOs to the start-ups’ growth strategy (Table 2).
Most (66%) thought it was hard for a small, innovative firm to develop a new market on its own. Of
the respondents, 21 (60%) estimated that the development strategy of their investees rested on
acquisition by another firm in the same field. These results confirm Ritter et al.’s (2012) assessment
that the change in exit mode signals a structural change. Responses to the statement that only large
international firms can take full advantage of a given innovation were mixed: about 46 percent of
respondents strongly or somewhat disagreed. The fact that acquirers of angel-backed start-ups are
rarely big multinational firms, but are usually medium-sized entities operating in a comparable field
or having developed complementary products, could explain these disparate results.
Fewer than one in two respondents thought that the IPO had become a scarcely used exit mode
because it is hard for a small innovative firm to develop a new market on its own. In addition,
demand-side factors probably explain the IPO decrease. Indeed, 66 percent of the respondents
thought that there was little demand among investors for an IPO in innovative firms. About 75
percent agreed strongly or somewhat that the lack of underwriters interested in small public offerings was a major obstacle to IPOs, and 63 percent thought that the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweighed their advantages.
Thus, the angels confirmed P1 and P2: they preferred a trade sale exit to an IPO exit, mainly for
strategic considerations, in line with the economies of scope hypothesis.

Perception of securities regulation
Table 3 shows that 60 percent of the respondents agreed that securities regulation was a major
obstacle to IPOs, while 28 percent were undecided; while 83 percent thought that IPOs incur
considerable costs for small-sized issuers. Ongoing listing requirements applicable to listed
companies generate significant costs and delays, according to 74 percent of the angels, and the
costs resulting from securities regulation have increased during the last decade. A total of 52
percent of the angels thought that securities regulation was unduly detailed and complex. Overall,
these responses convey their negative perception of the costs, delays and intricacies associated
with securities regulation. This negative perception probably influences angel exit decisions, in
agreement with P3.

Perception of the Canadian stock market
The TSXV is an option for private investors seeking early exit. Only 49 percent of the respondents viewed this market positively (Table 4), while 13 respondents thought that in general, the
TSXV was inefficient. Overall, their perceptions of the TSXV were mixed. For 75 percent of
respondents, the lack of liquidity of the Canadian market was problematic. Most respondents
(72%) thought that value and liquidity were higher in the USA. Only two disagreed, while
eight were undecided. In all, 51 percent thought that when possible, it was better to launch an
IPO on an American stock exchange than a Canadian one. Thus, the respondent opinions support P4.

Respondent comments
Two open questions allowed the respondents to comment upon exits. Each remark was transcribed
in a grid, similar comments were grouped and the number of respondents with the same opinion
were reported (Table 5). The most often-cited obstacle to an IPO is its cost (10 answers), linked to
securities regulation (six), followed by illiquidity (nine), probably because firms that access the

stock market are too small to justify an active market (five). This illiquidity and the small size of
the issuers are linked by some angels to their low IPO value. This quote illustrates this point:
Innovation is hindered by investor mistrust and misunderstanding. Several of these firms access the
market too early, unaware of what is needed to generate short-term expectations. [This leads to] a low offer
price and/or a large subsequent price drop … Unless a firm has a stated profitability and a growth (and/or
acquisition) plan, I do not see how an IPO could reach the same value as a strategic acquisition by a known
firm searching to improve its strategic position. (Respondent X, business angel)

Overall, angel comments are consistent with P1 to P3: strategic acquirers offer higher value and
regulation incurs high costs. The angels were asked: ‘Why do you think VCs, previously the main
originators of IPOs, now prefer trade sales?’ Three main reasons emerged: the significant advantages of trade sales, IPO costs and market characteristics and conditions. For seven angels, trade
sales provided higher value in a shorter time. A typical comment is as follows:
Trade sales are easier to conclude, can be done quickly and generally provide a favourable rate of return
or several opportunities, because large firms now prefer to buy small firms with developed concepts or
products than to develop them internally. (Respondent Y, business angel)

Overall, this comment is consistent with the economies of scope hypothesis. One angel mentioned
that only strategic investors can value an innovation correctly. Seven respondents linked the
decrease in IPOs to the costs and duration of the process. There is a perception that costs and complexity have increased. Structural and cyclical market situations were cited by five and six respondents, respectively. Structural problems are associated mainly with illiquidity on the secondary

market. Small listed firms are not followed by the analysts, do not raise funds and their stocks
rapidly become neglected. The respondent comments confirm a dual explanation for the rejection
of IPO exit; economies of scope and high regulatory burden. Further, the implementation of an
active junior market is not an acceptable solution for angels. This market is perceived clearly to be
inefficient and illiquid. This should be considered by proponents of a regional stock exchange as a
way of easing the financing of small companies (Amini et al., 2012).

Analysis by angel experience
The 34 respondents who mentioned the number of investments were divided into three groups. The
22 experienced angels had made four investments or more, and a group was created for the four
virgin angels. Of the experienced angels, 59 percent preferred trade sales versus 38 percent of the
less experienced angels. One in four of the less experienced angels preferred IPO exit, versus one
in seven in the experienced angels. There seems to be a link between angel experience and their
opinions on exits.2 About 50 percent of experienced angels thought that trade sale provided better
firm value, versus 13 percent of the less experienced angels. Nearly 64 percent of the experienced
angels claim that trade sales give the fastest return on investment, compared with 38 percent of the
less experienced angels. For 68 percent of the experienced angels, the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweigh their advantages. This proportion is only 50 percent for the less experienced
angels. Thus, investment experience seems to be associated with a net preference for trade sale
exits.

<-----Page 9----->Carpentier and Suret

Most of the experienced angels (73%) thought that securities regulation was a major obstacle to IPOs, compared to 38 percent of the less experienced angels. A larger proportion of
experienced than inexperienced angels (82% versus 63%) estimated that ongoing listing
requirements generated significant costs and delays. Almost twice as many experienced as
inexperienced angels (59% versus 38%) found securities regulation unduly detailed and complex. Most of the experienced angels (64%) thought that lock-up dispositions deterred investors
from participating in an IPO, versus only 25 percent of the less experienced angels. Overall,
experienced angels perceive the costs and requirements of securities regulation more negatively, and tend to view them as an important obstacle to IPOs. Experienced angels also were
more negative than less experienced angels about the problems associated with illiquidity and
value (86% versus 63%). The differences between the angels according to their experience are
consistent with P5.

Conclusion
The results of this study show that angels acting in groups clearly prefer trade sale exit. The findings have several implications. Entrepreneurs should be aware that the angel objective, when acting in groups, has ceased to be a long-term association with the new venture. Peters (2009) contends
that selling shares after three to four years can be satisfactory for a serial entrepreneur. Such a rapid
exit cannot be acceptable for entrepreneurs willing to cultivate their own firms over the long term
and to link their careers to this venture. Accordingly, private investors must discuss their long-run
objective with entrepreneurs before committing to any funding. One caveat is that these results
include only the angel viewpoint on exit. Entrepreneurs and investors such as VCs may have conflicting viewpoints on an exit strategy (Collewaert, 2012; Harrison et al., 2010). This dimension
has been left for further studies to address.
For angels, the results of this study indicate that more attention should be given to exits,
including their selection of investment proposals, deal structure and development strategy. It
remains to be determined whether this indicates a structural shift, or is merely a temporary
phenomenon grounded in stock market activity and cash availability in large firms. The
respondents agreed that the preference for trade sales comes from the strategic acquirer’s capacity to exploit innovation rapidly and create synergistic effects. In a small market such as Canada,
most acquirers are likely to be foreign firms, which implies that the country is losing part of its
investment in fostering innovation. However, early exits are not necessarily negative. Some of
the newly-acquired wealth can be reinvested, together with the experience accumulated, in
multiple entrepreneurial activities, as noted by Mason and Harrison (2006). However, the total
lack of IPOs is not good news for a small economy; thus complementary research on this topic
is warranted.
Securities regulations and the high costs of IPOs also explain respondent reluctance to exit an
IPO, even if Canada has one of the most accessible stock markets in the world. It is possible that
regulatory changes could be made to obviate the regulation burden assumed by small listed firms;
however, any regulatory easing on such a market may reduce information and liquidity. It is difficult to argue for a concomitant increase in liquidity and a decrease in disclosure requirements. For
academics, the study results indicate that the funding escalator from love money to angels, VCs
and IPOs is becoming the exception rather than the norm.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first surveys dedicated to angel exit strategy. More evidence
is required before its conclusions can be generalised. Further studies should analyse the impact of
exit choice on investment proposal selection, and on the strategy proposed to, or imposed, on
investees.

Notes
1.	 The government has provided CAN$20m to implement a matching fund granting co-investments on a
deal-by-deal basis. On June 2013 the group’s members had financed 22 firms, reinvested in three and
exited from two. In 18 cases (82%) the deals involved a co-investor, generally a small VC fund. The
average total deal of the members of the group is more than CAN$1.2m and the average angels-only deal
is CAN$484,000. In all, 76 percent of the investees have reached the revenues stage, similar to the 74
percent proportion reported in Canada (Mason, 2011a).
2.	 If the four virgin angels are grouped with the less experienced angels, the conclusions of the analysis are
unchanged. The tabulated results are available on request from the authors. The small number of observations by class does not allow statistical tests to be made.
