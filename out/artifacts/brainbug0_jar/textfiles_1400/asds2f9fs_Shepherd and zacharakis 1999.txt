Conjoint analysis: a new methodological approach
for researching the decision policies of venture
capitalists
DEAN A. SHEPHERD and ANDREW ZACHARAKIS
(Received 3 April 1998; final version accepted 2 September 1998)
Decision making is central to the ability of venture capitalists to predict those new ventures
likely to succeed, yet most studies into their decision making use post-hoc methodologies
that may generate biased results. People are poor at introspection and often suffer from
recall and post-hoc rationalization biases among others. Therefore, researchers should
consider using real-time methods that eliminate many of these biases. One such method is
conjoint analysis. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the potential that conjoint analysis
has to: (1) improve the validity of prior research into VCs’ decision making; and (2) act as a
catalyst for adopting conceptual tools from other disciplines that can be tested empirically.
Both these functions have the purpose of increasing one’s insight into the assessment
policies of VCs.
Keywords: conjoint analysis, research methods, research opportunities.

Introduction
In the USA, venture capitalists (VCs) invested $7.5 billion in 1995
(Rosenberg 1996) and they invested $10.1 billion in 1996 (Bailey and Syre
1997). These sums are significantly higher than the amounts invested only
a few years previously. Not surprisingly there has also been considerable
interest shown by entrepreneurship research scholars as VCs demonstrate
expertise in identifying those new businesses with the greatest chance for
success. For example, new ventures backed by VCs tend to achieve a higher

survival rate than non-VC backed businesses (Kunkel and Hofer 1990).
Studies find that survival for VC backed ventures ranged from around 65%
(Sahlman 1990) to 85% of the VC’s portfolio (Dorsey 1979).
The primary objective of previous research into VCs’ decision making
has been to determine how VCs evaluate potential investments. The
methods used in these studies typically ask VCs to list and rank decision
criteria based on their presumed effect on their investment decision
(Tyebjee and Bruno 1981, Kahn 1987). The reported decision criteria
typically relate to the quality of the entrepreneur/team, uniqueness of the
product/service, attractiveness of the market as well as financial considerations (cf. Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, MacMillan et al. 1985, 1987). The
quality of the entrepreneur/team is generally reported as the most
important consideration in a VC’s assessment of new venture success
(Hutt and Thomas 1985).
Most of the studies into VCs’ decision making have relied on post-hoc
methods of data collection. Such methods rely on questionnaires, surveys
and/or interviews to collect data on VCs’ self-reported decision policy for
decisions made in the past (retrospective reports). This reliance on retrospective and/or self-reported data is likely to produce biased results (Huber
and Power 1985, Golden 1992, Zacharakis and Meyer 1998). Problems
associated with retrospective reports include a decision maker’s motivation to
bias the result (March and Feldman 1981) as well as possible cognitive and
perceptual limitations (Fischhoff 1982). Studies using self-reported data
depend upon a VC’s accurate insight into the decision policy actually used.
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) and Shepherd (forthcoming) provide evidence
that VCs have only limited insight into their decision process and therefore
question the validity of studies relying solely on self-reported data.
Research method limitations represent research opportunities for
those equipped with the appropriate theories and techniques. In this
paper the authors propose that conjoint analysis is a technique
particularly well suited to improve the validity of prior empirical
research within the venture capital domain. The authors also propose
that there are research opportunities for VC scholars arising out of
theory from other disciplines (e.g. economics, social psychology, and
strategic management) that would be well suited to empirical investigation using conjoint analysis.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and encourage the
use of conjoint analysis as a possible technique to be used in the
investigation of some interesting questions confronting researchers of
VCs’ decision making.
Conjoint analysis provides scholars with the opportunity to: (1)
overcome research method limitations prevalent in previous research; and
(2) open up interesting new avenues of research. Therefore, the
contribution of this paper will hopefully be an increased number of VC
scholars using conjoint analysis, ultimately resulting in more valid research
results and the empirical investigation of ‘new’ research directions.
The study proceeds as follows: first, the VCs’ decision-making
literature is reviewed in terms of findings and research methods. Second,
the potential contribution of real-time methods is discussed and the

different real-time methods are compared. Third, description of the
conjoint method is provided. Fourth, possible threats to validity arising
from the use of conjoint analysis are addressed. Finally, some research
opportunities arising from well established theoretical frameworks and the
use of conjoint analysis are offered.
Literature review: VCs’ investment decisions
VCs are often recognized as successful in predicting new venture
performance (Dorsey 1979, Sandberg 1986, Kahn 1987). Since 1980,
many studies have investigated venture capital with a number of
different research objectives. Fried and Hisrich (1988) classified venture
capital research in terms of the following categories: portfolio of
venture capital firms, venture capital investment decisions, operations,
strategy, impact on entrepreneurship and public policy. This study
focuses on the ‘venture capital investment decisions’ category of
research.
Research findings
The primary objective of research into VCs’ investment decisions is
to determine how VCs evaluate potential investments. Tyebjee and
Bruno (1984) found VCs’ investment decisions can be predicted from
their risk and return perceptions. Return is most often evaluated by
VCs in terms of profitability (cf. Timmons 1981, Robinson and
Pearce 1984, Roure and Keeley 1990) and risk in terms of the
probability of venture survival (cf. Gorman and Sahlman 1986,
Meyer et al. 1993).
A synthesis of VCs’ decision-making studies (contained in table 1)
details the author(s) of the study, method and data collection, sample,
statistical analyses and a summary of the findings. The most consistent
finding across studies is the importance that VCs placed on the ability
of management, whether it be management skill (Tyebjee and Bruno
1981), quality of management (Goslin and Barge 1986), characteristics
of the management team (Hisrich and Jankowitz 1990), or management’s track record (Hutt and Thomas 1985). Surprisingly, however,
Hall and Hofer (1993) and Keeley and Roure (1989) found the
entrepreneur/entrepreneur team not be be important predictors of VCs’
decision policies.
Other criteria which VCs report that they use when assessing new
venture proposals include the characteristics of the market/industry
(MacMillan et al. 1985, Hisrich and Jankowitz 1990), environmental
threats to the business (Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, Meyer et al. 1993),
the level of competition (Hutt and Thomas 1985, Kahn 1987, Muzyka
et al. 1996) and the degree of product differentiation (Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984, Hutt and Thomas 1985, Kahn 1987, Hisrich and
Jankowitz 1990).

Management staying power and familiarity with the market were judged to be the
most important characteristics of a successful venture.

VCs define investment predictors as: desire for success, creativity/ingenuity,
tenacity/courage, enthusiasm/capacity for work, competence in field of endeavour
and uniqueness of product relative to competition.

The criteria of whether a proposal was funded are oriented around the financial
projections and whether the plan is well balanced and professionally written.

The quality of the management team is of primary importance to VCs in their
investment decision. Desired management qualities are described.

VCs attribute the major cause of venture failure with senior management and
product development failures.

27 criteria used by VCs in their evaluation of proposals grouped into six categories:
the entrepreneur’s personality, experience, characteristic of product, characteristic
of market, financial considerations and venture team.

Management’s track record is important to VCs as is the basic market product
differentiation and competition.

VCs base their investment evaluation on: market attractiveness (size, growth and
accessibility), product differentiation (includes uniqueness of product), managerial
capabilities, environmental threats and cash-out potential.

Reasons perceived by entrepreneurs for denial of venture capital are: market
potential, management, competition and product feasibility. These excluded
venture related factors or deal structure. Less likely to ascribe denial to their
management capabilities than VCs.

When investigating favorable and unfavorable investment decisions the most
important determinant is management skill.

VCs report firm specific failure determinants as external market conditions,
management skill, product timing, strategy, capitalization and implementation.
General failure determinants are management skill, strategy, external market
conditions, product design and product timing

VCs screen and assess business proposals very rapidly. The key criteria used by
VCs to make investment decisions are the long term growth and profitability of the
industry. Surprisingly there was a lack of importance placed on the entrepreneur
and/or entrepreneurial team nor the proposed strategy.

This pilot study produced eight factors, entrepreneur’s knowledge, management
expertise, unique product, patent protection, functioning prototype, market
growth, level of competition and expected gross margin. They conclude that
VCs’ decision making can be modelled with conjoint hybrid conjoint models with a
high degree of consistency.

The most important factor VCs consider in investment appraisals is managerial skill
in the particular sector. Marketing skills are also considered important.

VCs refer to the general traits of the proposer, the management team, continuity of
market, product-market uniqueness, funding base and risk in thinking about
investment proposals. Other criteria include the plan itself, use of technology and
market location.

Prior to 1982 management, strategy and industry were good predictors of 34 firms
performance. Post 1982, these criteria were poor predictors. This is attributed to a
change in the nature of competition not in the business plans.

Simultaneous Verbal Suggests a contingent relationship among the criteria used by VCs. What VCs want
Protocol analysis
in a venture often depends upon the characteristics of the industry, the track record
of the entrepreneurial team, and proposed strategy. The sample was to too small to
permit conclusions.

VCs exhibit limited introspection into the policies they ‘‘use’’ to assess likely
profitability. VCs overstate the least important criteria and understate the most.

Actuarial models can improve VCs’ decision accuracy as models do not suffer from
cognitive overload created by the amount and type of information surrounding the
decision.

Uses theorectically jusitified criteria from IO strategy and applies it to VCs’
assessment of new venture profitability. The results demonstrate that the effect of
certain decision criteria must be qualified by the presence of contingent relationships, specifically, an interaction with timing of entry.

VCs are not good at introspection. They are consistent in their decision making
process. The cues are from previous studies, primarily Tyebjee and Bruno (1984);
MacMillan et al. (1985, 1987); Robinson (1987) and Timmons et al. (1987).

Financial, product/market, strategic competitive fund, management team, competence and deal factors are seen by VCs as important in their investment decision.
This study supports conjoint as a strong tool for decision research.

Research method limitations of previous research
As displayed in table 1, much of the research into VCs’ investment
decisions has relied on post-hoc methodologies. In other words, researchers
have used questionnaires, surveys and interviews to query the VC on how
various decisions were made. While insightful and undoubtedly advancing
the field, Huber and Power (1985) and Golden (1992) propose that
retrospective reports provide data that have errors and biases. These biases
and errors may arise from respondents’ motivation to bias the results
(Cannell and Henson 1974, March and Feldman 1981), perceptual and
cognitive limitations (Nisbett and Ross 1980, Fischhoff 1982), lack of
crucial information about the event of interest (Phillips 1981), and
variability depending on elicitation technique used. This has the effect of
possibly confounding reported results.
A further consequence of restricting decision-making studies to listing
‘espoused theories’ (VCs self-describing their decision policy) is that selfreports often result in an overstatement of the number of criteria actually
used, understatement of the most important criteria and overstatement of
the least important criteria when compared to more sophisticated methods
of decision-making analysis (Riquelme and Rickards 1992, Zacharakis and
Meyer 1998, Shepherd forthcoming). These limitations extend to an
inability to investigate possible contingent (also known as interactive)
relationships. Consequently studies of ‘espoused’ decision policies may not
provide an in-depth understanding of VCs’ decision policies.
Verbal protocols: an attempt to overcome research method
limitations
Recent studies by Sandberg et al. (1988), Hall and Hofer (1993), and
Zacharakis and Meyer (1995) attempt to overcome prior post hoc study
flaws by using verbal protocols. Verbal protocols are real-time experiments
where the VC ‘thinks aloud’ as a business plan is being screened. Thus,
VCs are not required to introspect about their thought processes, which
removes recall and post-hoc rationalization biases (Sandberg et al. 1988).
Moreover, the verbal protocol approach provides richer understanding of
the decision process whereas post-hoc methods focus on the decision
outcome (Hall and Hofer 1993). Results from verbal protocol studies
suggest that VCs’ insight into their decision processes may be less than
perfect. For example, Hall and Hofer (1993) found that the VC pays
relatively little attention to entrepreneur/team characteristics and even less
attention to strategic issues of the new venture proposal. Such findings
appear to contradict most post-hoc studies that find that the entrepreneur is
typically the most important factor. Additional real-time investigation
might provide further insight into VCs’ decision policies to help to explain
such discrepancies.
However, Riquelme and Rickards (1992) question the subjectivity of
the analysis and interpretation involved in verbal protocol techniques
without being supplemented with other techniques such as computer

<-----Page 8----->204

algorithms. They suggest that verbal protocol analysis is more an art than a
science and conjoint analysis is an appropriate technique for the analysis of
VCs’ decision making.
Conjoint analysis: an attempt to overcome research method
limitations
Conjoint analysis is a general term referring to a technique that requires
respondents to make a series of judgements, based on profiles, from which
their ‘captured’ decision processes can be decomposed into its underlying
structure (i.e. the attributes’ significance in the judgement, how these
attributes affect the judgement and the relative importance of each attribute
in the decision process). A profile is simply a combination of all the
attributes where each attribute is described by one of its levels (a level is an
assigned value for an attribute). Conjoint analysis allows the investigation
of what Argyris and Schon (1974) refer to as ‘theories in use’ as opposed to
‘espoused theories of action’.
Conjoint analysis has been used in hundreds of studies of judgement
and decision making in other fields of research, especially in marketing
where it has a strong tradition (Stewart 1988, Green and Srinivasan 1990).
These studies vary from research into consumer purchase decisions (Lang
and Crown 1993), manager’s strategic decisions (Hitt and Tyler 1991,
Priem and Harrison 1994) and the expert judgement of auditors (Davis
1996). For example, Bonner (1990) used conjoint analysis and found
experience played a significant role in an auditor’s assessment of risk.1
The pilot study of Riquelme and Rickards (1992) was the first, to the
authors’ knowledge, to utilize conjoint analysis to investigate VCs’ decision
policies. The study investigated the decision policies of six VCs. Riquelme
and Rickards (1992) found that during the screening stage VCs use a noncompensatory method (i.e. a low score on one criterion results in proposal
rejection) with entrepreneurial experience and the existence of a prototype
being particularly important criteria. In subsequent stages of evaluation and
due diligence, VCs use a compensatory method (i.e. a decision policy that
allows a low, but acceptable score on one criteria so long as this low score is
offset by high scores on other criteria). Important decision criteria during
these later stages are entrepreneurial experience, patents, and profit margin.
Although the findings of this study are interesting in themselves, the major
contribution of the study is demonstrating that VCs’ decision policies can be
modelled through both conjoint analysis and hybrid conjoint analysis with a
high degree of consistency.
Muzyka et al. (1996) follow Riquelme and Rickard’s (1992) lead of
using more sophisticated experimental techniques, such as conjoint
analysis, to address the research method limitations of previous VC
decision-making research (described above). Muzyka et al. (1996)
investigate key criteria used by European VCs in evaluating potential
investments characterized by 53 profiles (each profile required the
respondent to make a trade-off between a pair of independent criteria).
To determine which attributes were to be included in the conjoint analysis,

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:20 20 April 2008

CONJOINT ANALYSIS

205

open ended interviews with VCs were carried out to capture their list of
self-reported criteria. They identify 35 criteria reported by VCs in selecting
investments. Conjoint analysis was then used and results provided a
ranking of investment decision criteria and their relative importance in
evaluating opportunities. They found that all five management team
criteria were ranked among the first seven, product-market criteria
appeared to be only moderately important, and fund and deal criteria
were at the bottom of the rankings.
Likewise, Zacharakis and Meyer (in press) used conjoint analysis and
had VCs evaluate 50 ventures in a decision-making experiment. They
found that the entrepreneur was not as important as prior post-hoc studies
or Muzyka et al. (1996) indicate. Far more critical were market and
competition factors.
The above conjoint studies use results from post-hoc studies (those
studies that use post-hoc data collection methods) as the basis for selecting
the decision criteria to be included in the conjoint experiment. Shepherd et
al. (forthcoming) use theoretically justified criteria from industrial
organization (IO) strategy research and apply it to VCs’ decision making
in the assessment of new venture profitability. The results demonstrate that
while a number of criteria affect the decision strategies of VCs for some,
their effects must be qualified by the presence of contingent relationships,
specifically, an interaction with timing of entry. These contingent
relationships are consistent with IO strategy.
Contribution of real-time methods
Post-hoc and real-time research methods
Real-time methods overcome many of the potential research biases
associated with post-hoc methods. Real-time methods collect information
about the ‘in use’ decision policy as the decision is being made, whereas
post-hoc methods collect data about a decision after the decision has been
made, typically asking the VCs to self-report their decision policy
regarding an event in the past. Utilizing real-time methods rather than
post-hoc methods allows the researcher to overcome many of the problems
associated with retrospective reports (e.g. decreases the ability of
respondents to bias the results and decreases the reliance on perceptual
and cognitive skills to recall information about the event of interest). Realtime methods also overcome the potential limitations of post-hoc methods
associated with self-reporting – self-reporting relies on the veracity of a
VC’s ‘espoused’ decision policy while research suggests that there is only a
low correlation between a VCs’ ‘espoused’ decision policy with their
‘actual’ decision policy (Zacharakis and Meyer 1998, Shepherd forthcoming). Furthermore, post-hoc methods have difficulty in collecting
contingent decision data, which is a concern in light of the finding of
Shepherd et al. (forthcoming) of the significance of contingent relationships in VCs’ assessment of new venture profitability. Conjoint analysis is
well suited to investigating interactions among decision criteria.

Real-time techniques and appropriate research questions
Real-time methods of verbal protocols and conjoint analysis have the
potential of greatly deepening our understanding of VCs’ decision
making. Real-time methods include verbal protocol analysis, repertory
grid analysis and conjoint analysis. Verbal protocol and repertory grid
analysis are procedures that require the VCs to think aloud as they make
their decision. The authors have already defined conjoint analysis
although it needs to be pointed out that there are number of ‘conjoint’
methods and each method is suitable for different types of research
questions.2 The authors believe that metric conjoint analysis and policy
capturing are the two techniques most applicable to VC research as they
are not constrained to ‘main effect’ only models, i.e. both metric
conjoint analysis and policy capturing allow for the investigation of
contingency (interactive) relationships advocated by Shepherd et al.
(forthcoming). Both the ‘think aloud’ and conjoint techniques overcome
many of the research method limitations of post-hoc studies, although
which technique is best suited for VC research?
The answer to this depends on the research question. Conjoint analysis
is an excellent technique for theory testing, i.e. for investigating
hypothesized relationships between a number of decision criteria and a
particular judgement. Specifically, conjoint analysis is well suited for
research questions that involve the significance and/or relative importance
of a set of decision criteria for a particular judgement as well as
investigating hypothesized contingent relationships. Furthermore, conjoint
analysis offers the ability to conduct statistical tests at the individual level –
a sample of one is sufficient to obtain statistical power to test for
significance. Obviously a greater sample size is required to generalize the
study’s results to a specific population although small sample sizes of
around 60 appear to be sufficient.3 Allowing smaller sample sizes is ideal
for studies requiring data from populations that are difficult to contact or
are reluctant to participate in studies – this is especially true for studies
involving VCs.
Conjoint analysis, however, is inappropriate for certain types of
questions. For example, conjoint analysis is inapporpriate for investigating the process VCs use to search for and select the relevant
information that will be used in a decision. Methods such as protocol
analysis, which ask the VCs to talk through their decision-making
process (think aloud) are well suited for this type of research. For
example, protocol analysis has the potential to investigate how a VC
searches through a business plan and which attributes (cues) are
extracted from the plan to be used in the decision. Conjoint analysis
requires that the cues are known beforehand and the number of cues
are manageable (usually < 9). Protocol analysis is an excellent technique
for exploratory research into decision making, whereas conjoint analysis
is inappropriate for exploratory research but well suited for certain
theory testing research.
Furthermore, conjoint analysis is not appropriate for all theory testing
decision-making research. Conditions where respondent’s time is limited

and analysis is required only at the aggregate level, a survey method using
analysis of variance may better serve the researcher. Questions investigating causes and effects, as opposed to correlations, are inappropriate for
conjoint analysis and better suited to path analysis or Lisrel. Conjoint
analysis is an excellent tool for investigating some decision-making
questions and inappropriate for others.4 How to apply conjoint analysis
to appropriate research questions is now discussed.
Conjoint analysis: description of method
Conjoint analysis is a general term referring to a technique that requires
respondents to make a series of judgements based on a set of attributes from
which the underlying structure of their cognitive system can be
investigated. The series of judgements are made on a number of profiles.
Therefore conjoint analysis represents a concurrent (collected as the
decision is made), rather than a retrospective or self-reported technique for
obtaining data about a respondent’s judgements (decisions). The data are
then subjected to analysis that decomposes a series of judgements into its
underlying structure. From conjoint analysis the attributes that were
significantly used in the judgement, how those attributes were used, and
the relative importance of each attribute in the judgement can be
determined.
Research method considerations
To use conjoint analysis to investigate both individual and aggregate
decision making the researcher needs to perform five important tasks:
(1) select appropriate attributes and dependent variable; (2) develop
decision scenarios; (3) select appropriate sample with sufficient size;
(4) design instrument for collecting data; and (5) analyse the data.
While it is not possible to provide a full description of how to
conduct conjoint analysis in the space allowed, the major points are
described below.
Attributes and dependent variable
Conjoint analysis requires theory to drive attribute selection, i.e. a
researcher must propose the nature of a VC’s decision policy and then
test that proposition(s). The key is to identify what information is
critical to the decision being studied. The information is then
operationalized by assigning either relative values to the information
attributes (e.g. high or low) or concrete values (e.g. $1 million or
$1,000). However, conjoint analysis is limited by the number of
attributes that can be included in the experiment. To obtain a valid
measure of a subject’s decision process, there should be a minimum of
five scenarios for each attribute (Stewart 1993). Since it is imperative to

DEAN A. SHEPHERD AND ANDREW ZACHARAKIS

keep subjects alert and focused, the maximum recommended number of
attributes is eight, with many studies using three to five attributes.
(Stewart 1993)5
In developing conjoint profiles, attributable levels and the language
used to describe them should be chosen so they represent variation that
typically occurs in the decision environment of the population being
researched. Developing conjoint profiles in this manner helps to maintain
response validity. All the subjects need to understand and relate the
experimental decision to decisions they make in the real world. It is
important to describe the context in which the judgement is to be made.
Providing a common context helps to control respondent variation.
Moreover, a common context has the effect of assigning constant values
to those attributes not being investigated in the study.
The measurement scale for the dependent variable can involve ranking
scales and paired comparisons although the most commonly used is the
rating scale.
Scenarios
There are two primary approaches used to create scenarios: (1) attribute
driven; and (b) actual case derived. The appropriate approach depends on
the research question. Shepherd et al’s (in press) research question was to
investigate whether VCs assessed new venture performance in a way
consistent with his new venture strategy theories, thus an ‘attribute driven’
approach was appropriate. Zacharakis and Meyer (in press) investigated the
accuracy with which VCs assess new venture success and therefore the
‘actual derived profile’ approach was more appropriate. Each approach is
briefly described below.
In attribute driven conjoint analysis, data are collected by using an
experiment. An experimental design that involves every combination of
attribute levels is called a factorial design. For example, an experiment
involving eight attributes at two levels requires 28 or 256 profiles. A
fractional factorial design (a subset of all attribute level combinations)
is usually used as it reduces the number of combinations to a
manageable size (e.g. 256 profiles can be reduced to 16 profiles). The
type of fractional factorial design chosen depends on the number of
variables and their levels as well as the number of interactions to be
tested (it is rare to test three-way, four-way or higher order
interactions). Books on experimental designs typically provide fractional factorial plans.
Although using an attribute driven approach ensures an orthogonal
6
design, using actual derived cases to generate attribute values may give the
experiment greater face validity. In particular, the actual case method
allows the use of concrete attribute values (e.g. market size is $1.1 billion)
rather than relative reference values (e.g. market size is large). Using
concrete values ideally makes the experiment more closely match the actual
decision. Thus, the subject can better relate the simulated decision to an
actual decision.7

Sample
The authors will not go into issues of sampling and generalizability here as
these issues are common to all research techniques. However, as conjoint
analysis can investigate an individual’s decision making, a sample of one is
sufficient to obtain statistical power to test for significance. Obviously a
greater sample size is required to generalize the study’s results to a specific
population. As a general rule of thumb, the authors propose that a sample
8
size greater than 50 is normally sufficient. It is important to select an
appropriate sample, motivate them to participate in the study and maintain
that motivation until the instrument is complete.
Instrument
An important factor in maintaining motivation is the instrument itself. The
instrument can either be delivered via a paper packet of scenarios or via a
personal computer interactive program. The use of pictorial materials and
computers has been found to increase respondent interest and therefore
provide easier and potentially less ambiguous ways of conveying information. Increased respondent interest allows a greater number of attributes to
be included in the experiment without a decrease in respondent
consistency. Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) created an interactive instrument
and used personal computers. The research instrument should contain
clear instructions (including relevant term definitions), the conjoint
experiment and a post-experiment questionnaire that can include questions
regarding characteristics of the respondent.
Analysis
Regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are the two
statistical methods typically used to analyse conjoint derived data. For
example, to identify attributes that are statistically significant, an
individual-subject ANOVA is performed on the decision making of each
respondent. Although two or more attributes may significantly affect the
decision process, it is unlikely that those attributes will be of equal
importance. Therefore, statistical significance at the individual level is
supplemented with a measure of relative importance. Hays’ (1973) omega
squared (x 2 ), a measure of explained variance, is used to assess the relative
importance of each attribute and selected two-way interactions in the VC’s
decision.
To identify the attributes that are statistically significant at the
aggregate level, the regression coefficient (b ) for each attribute, derived
from the individual-subject level of analysis, can be averaged across
individuals with the sign of the b coefficient indicating the nature of the
relationship (Vancouver and Morrison 1995). The mean betas represent a
model of the sample’s decision policy. To identify whether a particular
attribute is significantly used by the sample, the t-statistics derived from

<-----Page 14----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:20 20 April 2008

210

DEAN A. SHEPHERD AND ANDREW ZACHARAKIS

the individual-subject analysis for that attribute can be aggregated to form
9
a Z-statistic (Dechow et al. 1994).
Predictive ability of individual and aggregate decision models can be
tested using a Pearson R correlation between the observed score on a set of
hold out cases and a predicted score obtained using the decision model(s).
The decision model(s) are those derived from regression.
Experimental formats can sometimes be unfamiliar to respondents and
it is therefore important to test the reliability of responses for each
individual. This provides an indication of the consistency with which they
apply their decision-making strategies. The replicated profiles can be
compared with the original/identical cases and used in a test-retest measure
using Pearson R correlations.
If variance across individuals is both significant and important, then a
K-means cluster analysis can be performed to identify distinct groups
within the sample by clustering estimated parameters of the model.
Validity of the cluster structure would then be explored through an
ANOVA of the relationship between cluster structure and shared
individual characteristics. Kamakura (1987) pools respondents who are
similar in terms of their conjoint responses, and employs an agglomerative
clustering algorithm. The number of clusters is chosen so as to maximize
predictive ability.
Even for research questions that conjoint analysis is well suited for,
researchers must be aware of potential limitations associated with the
technique. Some possible limitations are now addressed.
Possible threats to validity
Conjoint analysis, as with all techniques, has its own limitations. Through
design of the study and instrument these limitations can be minimized. The
primary criticisms directed towards some conjoint studies are: (1) the use of
paper ventures and paper environments lack external validity; (2) the
experimental format removes information search from the decision process;
(3) when using a fractional factorial design three-way and higher order
interactions may confound the results; and (4) the way a respondent judges
one object in isolation may be different when judged as a collection of
objects. Each criticism, and the means of minimizing the resulting threats
to validity, is now addressed.
1. Use of paper ventures and environments lack external validity. If possible,
the conjoint task should be representative of the task performed by the
respondent in real life. Under these conditions, Brehmer and Brehmer
(1988) suggest that conjoint analysis using experienced judges face few
external validity problems. However, constructing a conjoint experiment that is both representative and addresses the research question is
often difficult. Considerable research has found evidence that paper
representations are useful for capturing real policies (Phelps and
Shanteau 1978, Riquelme and Rickards 1992). ‘Professional judgement
may therefore involve some abstract coding of the cues (attributes),

<-----Page 15----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:20 20 April 2008

CONJOINT ANALYSIS

211

similar to that provided by policy capturing tasks’ (Brehmer and
Brehmer 1988: 89). Use of paper people and paper organizations in
conjoint analysis is still open to a threat to external validity but
represents an important step towards the research of ‘actual’ decision
making from which more valid inferences can be made than those
studies based on ‘espoused’ criteria alone (Stewart 1993).
2. Coded cues might eliminate perceptual elements from the task, thereby
placing less emphasis on judges’ ability to extract cue information. There is
the possibility that respondent’s could place importance on attributes only
because they are presented in the experiment. For practical purposes, more
detailed descriptions that would allow for cue extraction would increase
the time to complete the experiment to an unrealistic and unmanageable
level. Schepanski et al. (1992) show that experienced judges are unlikely
to place importance on a cue solely because it has been presented in an
experiment. While both these criticisms of conjoint analysis represent
limitations of the technique one must also be prepared to argue that the
inclusion of cues are theoretically justified and when pilot tested
demonstrate face validity.
3. Three-way and higher order interactions may have confounded the results.
Louviere (1988) proposes that in general the main effects often explain
80% of variance, two-way interactions rarely exceeds 6 to 8%, three-way
interactions rarely exceed more than 2 to 3% and usually 0.5 to 1%,
higher order interactions account for minuscule proportions of variance.
As a result, he proposes that it is normally sufficient to protect main
effects and two-way interactions against possibly significant three-way
interactions. This follows the general rule of confounding effects of
most interest with effects that are unlikely to be significant or, if they are
significant, are unlikely to cause much bias in the parameters that are
estimated (Louviere 1988).
4. The way a respondent judges one object or situation in isolation may be
different when judged as a collection of objects. A VC, for example, builds
an investment portfolio that requires judgement about one new venture
in relation to the rest of the portfolio ventures in order to reduce risk
over the entire portfolio. Therefore the VCs’ decision making may be
different when judging a new venture in isolation to judging a new
venture as part of a portfolio. This must be a consideration in the
development, testing and interpretation of a conjoint based study.
Research opportunities
Conjoint analysis is an empirical technique that will aid VC scholars in
researching important questions about the decision making of VCs.
However, conjoint analysis requires theory to drive the research process.
The authors propose that there are established bodies of literature that, in
conjunction with conjoint analysis, could provide considerable insight into
the decision policies of VCs. The following makes reference to some of
those possible bodies of literature and the research opportunities that are
accessible by capable scholars using conjoint analysis.

Economics
VC scholars and practitioners have relied heavily on economics to
understand financial markets and the behaviour of VCs at the firm level
of analysis, for example, how a venture capital firm may diversify some of
their risk by carefully constructing a portfolio of companies at varying
levels of risk (Brophy 1986). Economics scholars also have a strong
tradition of investigating choices under risk and uncertainty (Camerer
1995). The authors propose that VCs’ assessments often involve settings in
which risk and uncertainty are high. Therefore these sub-fields of
economics (among others) may provide a theoretical basis from which
one can research the decision making of a VC.
In a broad sense, researchers can investigate the rationality of a VC’s
decision policy, i.e. do VCs use maximizing models (substantive
rationality) or use reasonable procedures that are sub-optimal (procedural
rationality)? If they use sub-optimal models, what are these sub-optimal
models? Are the models of experienced VCs’ decisions different from
inexperienced VCs’ decision models? Why? Are they different from the
decision models of entrepreneurs? What impact do judgement errors
(optimal/sub-optimal) have on the performance of a VC, a venture capital
firm, the venture capital industry and/or even the general economy? Are
there conditions under which VCs make more judgement errors or where
these errors have the greatest impact? Can a VC’s decision making be
improved through the use of sophisticated computer generated decision
models (artificial intelligence)?
Conjoint analysis is an excellent technique to be used to empirically test
individual’s decision making within and/or across desired decision
environments (i.e. uncertain, risky and/or ambiguous environments).
Social psychology
VC scholars have paid little attention to the social psychology literature.
This is surprising as the cognitive structures of decision makers play a key
role in determining the purposive behaviour of organizations (Lord and
Kernan 1987). Research into the use of heuristics as well as sytematic errors
and biases has been a fruitful line of investigation within a number of
research fields (e.g. auditor’s decision making). Heuristics are rough
cognitive rules of inference, which are used by the decision maker to reduce
the complexity of situations (Scholz 1983). Therefore heuristics can be
thought of as models of decision making that have adpated to a particular
situation to allow for cognitive operative and capacity limitations.
Heuristics and biases can be inferred from when and how decision makers
use information. VCs operate under conditions of uncertainty that place
strain on information processing capabilities, involve high levels of emotion
and extreme time constraints. Under such conditions biases are likely to be
more prevalent (Baron 1998).
The heuristics of representativeness, availability, ‘anchoring and
adjustment’ and over-confidence are common in the study of judgement

<-----Page 17----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:20 20 April 2008

CONJOINT ANALYSIS

213

under certainty yet rarely researched in the VC context. For example, the
‘anchoring and adjustment’ heuristic suggests that: (1) an arbitrarily chosen
reference point (anchor) will significantly influence value estimates; and (2)
value estimates will be insufficiency adjusted away from the reference point
toward the true value of the object of estimation (Slovic and Lichtenstein
1971). Does the level of uncertainty and/or ambiguity affect the reliance on
an anchor? If so, how does this affect the way VCs value potential
investments? What anchors do VCs use? How does anchoring and
adjustment bias impact the performance of a portfolio – do those VCs that
rely more heavily on inappropriate anchors have lower performance? Do
VCs allow an entrepreneur’s sunk costs to influence their valuation?
The authors propose that investigating the cognition of VCs will
make a significant contribution to the VC field. Conjoint analysis is well
suited to the task of investigating VCs’ decision policies and comparing
it with an unbiased decision policy. The differences, if any, could be
illuminating.
Strategic management
Strategic management has begun to emphasize sources of advantage arising
from organizational capabilities rather than industry positioning (Rumelt et
al. 1991). An important organizational capability is strategic decision
making as it is these decisions that lead to the shape of a firm and the
direction is takes, i.e. they are critical to a firm’s survival and long-term
profitability. Strategic decision making is an essential role of the
entrepreneur and represents a source of competitive advantage for a new
venture. There have been suggestions that strategic management can be
researched through a decision-making framework (Hofer and Schendel
1978, Priem and Harrison 1994) yet there has been little research into a
VC’s strategic decision making.
It has been proposed that VC’s typically operate in environments that
increase the likelihood of biases and errors in their decision making, i.e.
from an economics perspective they are less rational. This leads us to a
number of interesting questions for scholars of VC’s decision making. How
do VCs make their investment decisions in complex and turbulent
environments? Are these rational decisions? How does the degree of
rationality in an entrepreneur’s decision making affect portfolio performance? If one finds that VCs’ decision making is not rational, yet find
performance to be higher than it would have been if decision making had
been rational, then an important contribution to research is an investigation
of VC’s intuition. There are some important clues to this question from
Fredrickson (1984) and Miller (1987), who find in more complex and
turbulent environments that strategic decision makers are less rational yet
there is a negative relationship between the comprehensiveness of the
decision process (rationality) and performance. Conjoint analysis has been
used to investigate the strategic thinking of CEOs (Hitt and Tyler 1991)
and the authors propose that it would be equally well suited to investigate
the strategic thinking of VCs.

Conclusion
Decision making is central to the study of VCs. Understanding how VCs
and the other parties involved in new venture funding make decisions
should further illuminate the entrepreneurial phenomena. However, most
research into VCs’ decison making has relied on post hoc techniques.
Although insightful, real-time methods such as conjoint analysis have been
underutilized in VC research. The authors believe that conjoint analysis
can greatly advance the field by allowing scholars to approach current
questions utilizing a new methodological perspective and providing an
empirical key that opens up many important questions arising from other
disciplines.
Throughout this paper the authors have highlighted a number of
research questions well suited to conjoint analysis. Undoubtedly,
there are many others. Although this paper is designed to introduce
and encourage VC scholars to utilize conjoint analysis, it does not
provide guidance on how to conduct this technique. For those
researchers seeking further guidance in metric conjoint analysis refer
to Louviere (1988), Green and Srinivasan (1990), and Shepherd and
Zacharakis (1997). It is hoped that the authors have achieved their
objective of introducing conjoint analysis and the world of research
opportunities it opens up for us – researchers of VCs’ decision
policies.

Notes
1. Auditors are professionals who rely on their expertise to make assessments about a business’s
performance. In many ways this is similar to a VC assessing a business plan. While VCs’ assessments
may be more difficult and involve a different set of skills, current studies into expert judgement
provide evidence that conjoint analysis is a useful tool for researching expert judgement and is able to
differentiate between levels of expertise in complex tasks.
2. For a summary of the types of conjoint analysis and appropriate research questions see Priem and
Harrison (1994).
3. Issues relating to sample size are discussed below.
4. Some interesting research questions that are well suited for empirical investigation using conjoint
analysis are suggested in the ‘Research opportunities’ section below.
5. Issues of external validity arising from this limitation are addressed in the ‘Possible threats to
validity’ section below.
6. An orthogonal design ensures that there is no multicolinearity among the decision criteria.
7. The researcher must take steps to deal with possible multicolinearity.
8. For example, the sample sizes of Muzyka et al. (1996), Zacharakis and Meyer (1998), and Shepherd
et al (forthcoming), were 73, 53 and 66 VCs, respectively.
9. This technique is used primarily in meta-analysis and to the authors’ knowledge Shepherd et al.
(forthcoming) are the first to use this technique to aggregate respondent’s b coefficients in conjoint
analysis.
