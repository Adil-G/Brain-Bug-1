<-----Page 2----->Abstract
This work examines Niklas Luhmann’s (1927-1998) concepts of trust, confidence
and familiarity, and their functions in Luhmannian systems theory. Janne Jalava is
especially interested in the way these concepts would function in the context of
Luhmann’s advanced systems theory. This is because Luhmann wrote his
principal work on trust, Vertrauen, as early as in 1968. Although Luhmann can be
thought of as a system theorist already during that time, his magnum opus, Soziale
Systeme, on advanced systems theory was not published until 1984.
This work concentrates especially on five research problems. Firstly, it concerns
Luhmann’s own theory of trust, confidence and familiarity. Secondly, Jalava
studies the theoretical precursors (Talcott Parsons and Georg Simmel), who
influenced Luhmann’s writings on the topics as well as analyse how Luhmann’s
theory of trust, in turn, has affected the current theories on the topic (Anthony
Giddens and Piotr Sztompka). Thirdly, Luhmann’s theory of trust is then
examined in the context of advanced systems theory. Special emphasis is laid on
the way the growing importance of risks has affected the validity of trust,
confidence and familiarity. Fourthly, the connections between the advanced
Luhmannian concepts of trust, confidence and familiarity and the concept of
strangers are analysed. Fifthly, the analysis will move from personal level to
systemic and organisational levels. The work concentrates on the problematic of
trust and confidence in the context of the system of the welfare state, system of
care and caring organisations.
The most important result of this work, then, is to specify the history, position,
and meaning of trust in Luhmann’s systems-theoretical thinking. Jalava will also
show how it can be fruitful to examine the problems of ‘strangers’, the system of
the welfare state, and the system of care and caring organisations in the context of
Luhmannian trust and confidence.

<-----Page 3-----><-----Page 4----->Tiivistelmä
Työn tarkastelun kohteena on Niklas Luhmannin (1927-1998) luottamuksen
käsite. Erityisesti Janne Jalava on kiinnostunut siitä, miten Luhmannin
luottamuksen käsite toimii kehittyneen systeemiteorian kontekstissa. Tämä johtuu
siitä, että Luhmann kirjoitti luottamusta käsittelevän pääteoksensa, Vertrauen, jo
vuonna 1968 ja hänen systeemiteoriaa tarkasteleva pääteos, Soziale Systeme,
ilmestyi vasta vuonna 1984.
Jalava lähestyy luhmannilaista luottamuksen problematiikkaa viidestä eri
näkökulmasta. Ensin hän tarkastelee Luhmannin omaa luottamusteoriaa. Vaikka
työn pääongelmana on tarkastella luottamuksen käsitettä, jakaa Luhmann omissa
kirjoituksissaan luottamusproblematiikan kolmeen käsitteeseen: luottamukseen
(trust), luottavaisuuteen (confidence) ja tuttuutteen (familiarity). Jalava pohtii
myös Luhmannin luottamusproblematiikan kannalta olennaisia teoreettisia
vaikuttajia (Talcott Parsons ja Georg Simmel) sekä Luhmannin luottamusteorian
nykyistä sosiologista merkitystä (erityisesti Anthony Giddensin ja Piotr
Sztompkan tutkimusten teoreettisena innoittajana).
Tämän jälkeen Jalava analysoi sitä, miten Luhmannin varhainen luottamusteoria
toimii kehittyneen systeemiteorian kontekstissa. Erityisesti Jalava pohtii riskien ja
kommunikaation vaikutusta luhmannilaisten luottamuskäsitteiden sosiologiseen
käyttökelpoisuuteen. Neljänneksi keskitytään muukalaisuuden ja luottamuksen
välisiin suhteisiin. Jälkimodernissa maailmassa olemme kaikki toisillemme
enemmän tai vähemmän muukalaisia. Enää siis Georg Simmelin klassinen
muukalaisuusteoria, jossa muukalaiset nähtiin yhteiskunnan toimivuuden kannalta
positiivisina ja luotettavina henkilöinä, ei ole yhteiskunnan toimivuuden kannalta
kovinkaan relevantti. Miten siis yleistynyt muukalaisuus ja terrorismi vaikuttavat
luottamusproblematiikkaan?
Seuraavaksi työssä tarkastellaan luottamusta systeemien ja organisaatioiden
tasolla

ja

pohditaan

luottamuksen

ja

luottavaisuuden

problematiikkaa

hyvinvointivaltion kontekstissa. Jalava näkee hyvinvointivaltion syklisenä

<-----Page 5----->kokonaisuutena, joka koostuu kansasta, politiikasta ja hallinnosta. Erityisesti hän
pohtii sitä, miten luottavaisuus kansan ja politiikan välillä rakentuu. Työssä
tutkitaan myös vanhusten hoivasysteemiä, joka on Jalavan analyysin mukaan
vähitellen kehittynyt hyvinvointivaltiollisen inkluusion myötä. Tässä yhteydessä
Jalava tutkii hoivasysteemin systeemiteoreettisia ongelmia ja sitä, onko kuitenkin
mielekkäämpää tarkastella hoivaa erilaisten organisaatioiden avulla ja täten
kyseenalaistaa hoivan systeemiluonne. Työn lopussa analysoidaan myös
hoivaajan ja hoivattavan välistä luottamusproblematiikkaa.

<-----Page 6----->Acknowledgements
A journey, rewarding but sometimes tough, is about to finish. This journey can be divided into four
periods. Because of the death of my loving father, the first period from 2000 to 2001 was the most
painful time in my life and it was often more than difficult to concentrate on doing research. After
this tragedy, in September 2001, I decided to leave to the University of Bielefeld to get the best
Luhmann knowledge in the world. Looking back, this period was definitely the richest time of my
university life. Without spending a half-year period in this scientifically inspirational environment
under brilliant supervising, my understanding about Luhmann and his systems theory would still be
in its infancy. After returning to Finland I continued writing the research. This third period, from
2002 to 2004, was also physically very painful because of a herniated disk in my back. Due to
persistent training my back started to heal and also my research work started to look better. It was in
October 2004 when I started to write the final version of this book. Now this last period of the
journey is about to finish, and I am grateful to many for sharing this path with me. Numerous
people have contributed to this fascinating journey.
I will probably never be able to describe the amount of encouragement and insight I have received
from one person. His support has been continuous. Risto Eräsaari deserves the most heartfelt thanks
for his support that helped me to grow into an independent researcher. Thank you Risto for being
my closest mentor during this journey. We certainly trust one another!
Beside Risto, this journey has been blessed with guidance and inspiration of two other central
figures whom I very highly respect. Keijo Rahkonen and Arto Noro have offered me time,
consideration and crucial advice. Without your contribution this project might never have been
finished. You both are inspiring and encouraging mentors! Special thanks go also to my preexaminers, Seppo Raiski and Risto Kangas, who read the entire manuscript and provided valuable
comments. Thank you for guiding me to the complex world of Luhmann’s systems theory. It is an
honour to follow your Luhmannian footsteps! The journey would have been much more difficult
without Tuomas Ylä-Anttila who has helped and inspired me on numerous occasions. I have shared
countless interesting discussions with you and received much good advice. Without friends like you
the world would be an empty place!

<-----Page 7----->The department of Social Policy, University of Helsinki, has been a warm-hearted and friendly
place to work at. I have been lucky to have as my university room-mate not just a colleague but a
very good and patient friend, Sampo Ruoppila. Thank you Sampo for sharing with me this journey!
I would like to thank also Rudolf Stichweh and Raf Vanderstraeten who warmly welcomed me as a
visiting researcher to the University of Bielefeld.
Last but not least, my deepest thanks go to my four closest persons. Needless to say, without Jaakko
Saari’s special contribution in the middle of 1990s, I would have never started to study social policy
and Luhmann’s systems theory. Without you, this research would not exist. My big brother, Juha
Jalava, has all along this journey reminded me that there is life also outside of University. Thank
you for keeping my feet on the ground! I have been blessed with wonderful parents, Ritva and
Touko Jalava. There are no words through which I could describe the amount of love and support I
have gotten from you.
Therefore, this book is dedicated to my dear mother Ritva and the memory of my loving father
Touko.
I have been entitled to work in SOVAKO (the Finnish Post-Graduate School of Social Sciences)
during this research process, and I am very grateful for this position. Beside SOVAKO, this
research has been funded by the Science Foundation of University of Helsinki, the Foundation of
Emil Aaltonen, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst and the Finnish Cultural Foundation.

This work examines Niklas Luhmann’s (1927-1998) concept of trust and its
functions in Luhmannian systems theory. Its most important aim is to show
how the Luhmannian concepts of familiarity, trust and confidence would
function in the context of advanced systems theory. Originally I acquainted
myself with the concept of trust by viewing the discussions of the
problematics of uncertainty, risks and complexity in the context of
postmodernity or reflexive modernisation. In no time it was revealed that
trust is a central element of these discussions. I concentrated on Anthony
Giddens’ writings on trust (see Jalava 2001), which, in turn, are largely
affected by Niklas Luhmann. During a half-year period of studying
Luhmann’s systems theory in Bielefeld, under the supervision of Luhmann
specialists (especially Rudolf Stichweh and Klaus Japp), I became
convinced that Luhmann’s concept of trust is sociologically unique and
highly important (see Jalava 2003), and that there are still many open
questions concerning this topic. In particular, I was interested in how
Luhmann’s concept of trust would function in the context of his systems
theory. This is because Luhmann wrote his principal work on trust,
Vertrauen, as early as the 1960s. Although Luhmann can be thought of as a
system theorist already at that time, his magnum opus, Soziale Systeme,
dealing in advanced autopoietic systems theory, was not published until
1984. Therefore, in this work special attention is given to the way that the
concept of trust would function in the context of advanced systems theory.
In addition, I study the way in which the concept of trust would function in
the context of ‘strangers’, the welfare state and the system of care. I see
trust as a decision, the function and meaning of which is to reduce the
complexity of society.
Luhmann’s reputation in the field of trust research is high. His writings on
trust have been widely used as a theoretical background in many
sociological (Giddens 1990; Misztal 1996; Seligman 1997; Sztompka 1999
etc.), political (Inglehart 1997; 1999, Hardin 1991; 1993; 1999; Warren
1

<-----Page 15----->1999 etc.), philosophical (Baier 1986; 1992; 1994, Lagerspetz 1996,
Loukola 1999), historical (Frevert 2000) and even commercial (Gefen
2000) contexts. However, none of these have seen trust as a part of
Luhmann’s advanced systems theory, but instead followed Luhmann’s
Vertrauen. This might be a consequence of the fact that Luhmann’s
Vertrauen, as stated above, had already been published in 1968 and Soziale
Systeme – where Luhmann studies the problem of trust only en passant –
sixteen years later. None of these researchers have perhaps noticed that the
meaning of Luhmann’s concept of trust might also have changed during the
development of his systems theory.
Another reason why Luhmann’s concept of trust has been detached by
many researchers from his systems-theoretical context is that his theory is
very complicated. This is largely because the primary unit of Luhmann’s
systems-theoretical analysis – in contrast to mainstream sociological
theorists – is neither the individual nor groups of people, but
communication. Unlike many other sociologists, Luhmann does not
primarily fall into questions of empirical, normative, ethical, and moral
issues nor does he stress the problems of everyday knowledge. What makes
Luhmann’s view on trust sociologically distinctive is the fact that the
urgency of the topic is intensively tied to the reality of societal
communication.
Yet it is extremely important to note that Luhmann himself did not
extensively analyse the concept of trust in the context of advanced systems
theory nor has it been explored by other systems theory oriented researchers
(for example Dirk Baecker, Rudolf Stichweh, Klaus Japp, Helmut Willke,
Hartman Tyrell and Armin Nassehi). There appears to be a systemstheoretical ‘silence’ on the subject of trust; a silence which this work seeks
to end.

<-----Page 16----->The Research Problem
Trust can be grasped as an important or even essential matter in human life.
Trust is more than just an interesting, difficult, and only recently widely
studied social phenomenon in sociology. The recent growing interest in
both trust as well as the closely related group of concepts such as social
capital, respect, recognition, confidence, associability, social cohesion,
legitimacy, and civil society may have to do with a widely shared, though
largely implicit, diagnosis of the basic problems of late modernity: the
growing importance of risks, the complexity of society, and the declining
significance of the nation state as a community based on shared norms and
values. In the Luhmannian concept of trust there is not a great amount of
room for normative, ethical or moral questions; the most important
intellectual influences behind Luhmann’s systems-theoretical thinking are
Talcott Parsons’ action theory, Humberto Maturana’s and Francisco
Varela’s

biological

theory

of

autopoiesis,

Edmund

Husserl’s

phenomenological philosophy, George Spencer-Brown’s mathematical
model of distinction, and Luhmann’s lifelong debate with Jürgen
Habermas, all of which – as well as Georg Simmel’s writings on trust – will
in turn be taken into consideration in the present study of the advanced
Luhmannian problematics of trust (see Figure 1).
This work concentrates on five research problems. The first looks at
Luhmann’s theory of trust. Secondly, the theory is examined in the context
of advanced systems theory. Then, thirdly, the connections between the
advanced Luhmannian concept of trust and the concept of ‘strangers’ are
analysed. Following this the analysis moves from the personal level to the
systemic and organisational level. The fourth research problem concentrates
on the problematics of trust and confidence in the context of the welfare
state, and then (the fifth problem) in the context of the system of care and
caring organisations (see Figure 1). The most important result of this work,
then, is to specify the history, position and meaning of trust in Luhmann’s
systems-theoretical thinking. In addition, I will show how it can be fruitful
3

<-----Page 17----->to examine the problems of ‘strangers’, the welfare state and the system of
care in the context of the Luhmannian trust.
The most important writings by Luhmann, to which the perspective of this
work is closely tied, are Trust (1979 [Vertrauen, 1968]) and Familiarity,
Confidence and Trust (1988). Starting from these texts, one can examine
Luhmann’s own theory of trust and confidence (see Figure 1). However, in
order to study trust and confidence in an advanced systems-theoretical
context, it is not enough to examine the topics only from the point of view
of Luhmann’s works concentrated directly on trust. The perspective of this
work is therefore tied also to Soziale Systeme (1984) and Die Gesellschaft
der Gesellschaft (1997), which are Luhmann’s principal works and where
he extensively analyses the autopoietic systems-theoretical problematics of
society (see Figure 1).
Furthermore, to analyse the advanced concepts of trust and confidence in
the special areas of ‘strangers’, the welfare state and care (see Figure 1) I
will – in addition to the four texts mentioned above – concentrate on
Luhmann’s view of the welfare state presented in Political Theory in the
Welfare State (1990 [Politische Theorie im Wohlfartsstaat, 1981]) and Risk:
A Sociological Theory (1993 [Soziologie des Risikos, 1991]), as well as
some of his writings on organisation theory. Along with Luhmann’s own
work, my analysis of the advanced concepts of trust and confidence is
influenced by several post-Luhmannian writings. The most influential
authors who have continued to elaborate Luhmannian systems theory here
are Rudolf Stichweh (1997; 2000; 2002; 2002b), Raf Vanderstraeten (2000;
2002, 2003), Roar Hagen (2000), Michael King and Chris Thornhill (2003;
2003b), Jan Inge Jönnhill (2003), Niels Andersen (2003) and Risto Kangas
(1995; 2001). The influences and research problems of this work are
illustrated in Figure 1.

<-----Page 19----->It is impossible to study either trust or society ‘as such’. This is because
society is an ‘imaginary institution’ that no one has seen but everyone talks
about; in fact, it exists only because we do talk about it (see Willke 1993).
This idea is also suitable for describing the character of trust. No one has
seen it, everyone talks about it, and there could neither be trust nor
recognition of trust without communication. I approach the problem of trust
mainly through Luhmann’s texts. I observe how he has observed, or
‘talked’ about, trust.
However, I have not read Luhmann’s systems theory systematically, but
rather selectively. This type of reading has given me a chance to select the
problems of society wherein Luhmannian trust and confidence are needed.
These problems intertwine here especially with the growing importance of
risks, the indifferent character of ’strangers’, the taxation and steering
problems of the welfare state and the differentiation of the system of care.
Moreover, these problems open new functional spheres for trust and
confidence. Luhmann’s own wish was that one might enter his work at any
point and discover it in many different ways. He hoped that his work would
find readers wanting to recombine the very elements of systems theory and
its descriptions of social phenomena. (Baecker 2003, 9.) Combining the
concepts of trust and confidence with the descriptions of ‘strangers’, the
welfare state and care, I have several times diverged from wholly abstract
thinking.
Luhmann’s studies of the welfare state, risks and trust are not as
theoretically oriented as the main part of his output.1 This fact has affected

1

The first book, which is not as theoretically oriented as most of Luhmann’s work, is
Vertrauen (1968). It is not so much systems-theoretically focussed but instead concerns
itself with the everyday problems of trust. The German preoccupation with the welfare
state in the 1970s also inspired Luhmann to challenge the concept of ‘the welfare state’ in
his book Politische Theorie im Wohlfartsstaat (1981). Moreover, the political rise of the
Green Party in Germany and the publication and influence of Ulrich Beck’s
Risikogesellschaft (1986) seem to have had the effect of dragging Luhmann down from the
theoretical stratosphere and motivating him to confront current social issues head-on. The

6

<-----Page 20----->my own position and writing style. Although the present work is
theoretically oriented, the analysis has been enriched by many quasiempirical examples. Also the fact that I, writing in English myself, have
used English translations of Luhmann’s work, has inevitably had an effect
on the style of the text at hand. Wherever translations have not been
available, I have provided my own.

The Architecture of the Study
The presentation of this work follows the logic of the development, or
differentiation, of Luhmann’s concept of trust. I begin with an examination
of Luhmann’s own writings on trust, confidence and familiarity. It should
be stressed that although the operative concept is trust, in Luhmannian
terms trust is a threefold concept consisting of familiarity, trust and
confidence. Therefore the connections between familiarity, trust and
confidence will also be addressed.
In Chapter Three I examine the theoretical precursors which influenced
Luhmann’s own writings on trust as well as analyse how Luhmann’s theory
of trust, in turn, has affected the current theories of trust. In particular, I
outline the development of Talcott Parsons’ normative open systems theory
and the role of trust in it, as well as provide an overview of Georg Simmel’s
conception of trust. Through studying the influences of Parsons and Simmel
it is possible to deepen the knowledge of the sociological traditions of trust
which have affected Luhmann’s concept of trust and also his general
systems theory. The following questions are important: What are the points
of reference between Luhmann, Parsons and Simmel, and how have
Parsons’ and Simmel’s writings on trust affected Luhmann’s conception of
the topic? Furthermore, I look into why some well-known psychological
accounts of trust as well as the traditional normative and moral
philosophical accounts have had hardly any influence on the development
results of these motivations can be found in Ökologische Kommunikation (1986; in Finnish
2004) and Soziologie des Risikos (1991).

7

<-----Page 21----->of Luhmann’s research on trust.2 Anthony Giddens’ and Piotr Sztompka’s
functionally oriented sociological approaches of trust will also be reviewed.
What make these two sociologists important from a systems-theoretical
perspective are the facts that they have appropriated many ideas from
Luhmann’s writings on trust and, like Luhmann, they refer to trust as
something that involves risks.
In Chapter Four I outline the logic of Luhmann’s autopoietic systems
theory, to provide the necessary background for the study of the functions
of trust and confidence in the context of advanced systems theory. I analyse
the four streams of influences (sociology, biology, philosophy and
mathematics) that stimulated Luhmann’s systems theory. Furthermore, the
basic concepts of autopoietic systems theory– autopoiesis, meaning,
communication,

evolution,

differentiation,

interpenetration,

double

contingency and structural coupling – are also explored. I concentrate in
particular on the following two questions: How does Luhmann construe the
giving of meaning to different things, and what are the roles of
communication, evolution and differentiation in Luhmann’s systems
theory? Furthermore, I make an excursion to the critical debates presented
against Luhmann’s general systems theory. Most importantly, I concentrate
on the critique of Jürgen Habermas. This critique culminates in a
comprehension of the concept and process of communication and deviant
political preferences that is different from Luhmann’s. I also analyse the
basic features of Ulrich Beck’s and John Mingers’ critiques of Luhmann.
The first criticises Luhmann’s general systems theory with a strict choice of
words and the latter argues that social autopoiesis offers an abstract and
reductive view of the social world.
2

It must be mentioned here that although Luhmann did not explore normative and moral
philosophical accounts of trust, in general he had an intensified interest in the history of
ideas and especially the philosophical tradition since Greek antiquity as an inventory of
intellectual experiments to be made use of in constructing a scientific discipline.
Luhmann’s trust in the productivity of conceptual work guided by interdisciplinary
concepts as well as concepts from the history of philosophy was obviously supported by
his legal education and his familiarity with legal dogmatics as a tradition grounding the
autonomy of jurisprudence on influence from many nonlegal interests in conceptual work
done in legal dogmatics. (See Stichweh 1999; 2005, 1-2.)

8

<-----Page 22----->Chapter Five analyses the problematics of the systems-theoretical concepts
of trust and confidence (see Figure 1). In other words, Luhmann’s own
theory of trust – which in this work is called the ‘early’ theory of trust – is
examined in the context of his advanced systems theory. The most
important question here is this: How can we adapt Luhmann’s concept of
trust to his advanced systems theory? This chapter is the most important of
the thesis. It analyses trust on an advanced systems-theoretical level, and
the results are adapted to specialised contexts in the following chapters.
Following Luhmann, I divide the topic into familiarity, trust and confidence
and analyse each in turn from the point of view of advanced systems theory.
Special emphasis is given to the ways in which the growing importance of
risks has affected the validity of these three variants of trust. Furthermore,
Giddens’ and Sztompka’s concepts of trust are analysed from the
perspective of Luhmann’s advanced systems theory.
Having examined the functions of trust and confidence in the framework of
Luhmann’s systems-theoretical scheme, the work proceeds to test the
Luhmannian concept of trust on new theoretical grounds. The functions of
trust and confidence are studied in the contexts of ‘strangers’, the welfare
state and the system of care (see Figure 1). The first context foregrounds on
interpersonal problems of trust, whereas in the latter two the problems of
confidence (as well as trust) are discussed in terms of the functions of
systems and organisations.
By following this type of logic in my work, I am able to offer a wideranging view of the functions and problematics of the Luhmannian concepts
of trust and confidence. My examination is not, then, restricted to
Luhmann’s own analysis but brings the discussion to current theoretical
problems of interpersonal trust (the problem of strangers and the trust
problems between a caregiver and a patient) and problems of systemic
confidence (confidence in the system of the welfare state and confidence in
the system of care and caring organisations).
9

<-----Page 23----->The problems and connections that exist between strangers and trust are the
topic of the sixth chapter. First, I go back to the classics and analyse Georg
Simmel’s concept of the stranger and explicate the problems of and
connections between strangers and the Simmelian trust. Why was Simmel’s
‘potential wanderer’ a trustworthy person? Second, to grasp the trust-related
problems concerning today’s universal strangers, I examine Rudolf
Stichweh’s systems-theoretical concept of the ‘indifferent stranger’, and the
connections between it and the systems-theoretical model of trust. In
addition to Simmel’s and Stichweh’s theories of ‘stranger’, I examine
today’s problem of the stranger from Zygmunt Bauman’s perspective of the
‘new poor’. I argue that today’s strangeness is linked to communication
possibilities and inclusions in systems. The central questions here are: What
are the specific features of the ‘indifferent strangers’, and why may we trust
them? The importance of the friend/enemy binary opposition will also be
discerned. Is it really true, as Stichweh claims, that strangeness and
friend/enemy binary opposition are not at all strategic problems in today’s
world? The growing importance of the new types of ‘strangers’ and the
fundamental threat of terrorism illustrate, rather, something quite the
opposite.
In Chapter Seven I examine Luhmann’s concept of the welfare state. The
analysis begins by considering the concept of inclusion, through which
Luhmann largely formulates his systemic model of the welfare state. I then
illustrate the functions, logic and problems of the Luhmannian cyclic model
of the welfare state, which consists of three subsystems: the public, politics
and administration. Following this, the functions of confidence within the
welfare state are characterised, and here the most important question is how
does the public’s confidence in politics and administration function.
Moreover, because the systemic model of the welfare state consists of

10

<-----Page 24----->several organisations, Luhmann’s organisation theory3 and the Luhmannian
logic of organisational trust and confidence are also explored.
In Chapter Eight I combine the systems-theoretical analyses of the
functional differentiation of the systemic model of the welfare state,
organisation theory, and the concepts of trust and confidence. Care,
especially care of the elderly, is considered a functional subsystem of
society which has gradually been developed or differentiated over the years
in the modern welfare state. First, after a brief review of different theories
of care, I address care as communication, and look at how the
communication of care works. How is the emergence of the systemstheoretical model of care possible? What are the functions of care in
Luhmann’s sense? Second, I specify the elements of contemporary care
organisations, and, with the help of organisation theory, further develop the
systems-theoretical model of the system of care. Third, aspects of the
interaction between a caregiver (social worker, nurse etc.) and patient are
examined from the systems-theoretical point of view. Fourth, some
problems which question the systemic character of care are analysed. And
fifth, the connections between Luhmann’s concepts of trust and confidence,
and the systems-theoretical model of care and caring organisations are
addressed. What are the roles of trust and confidence in the system of care
and caring organisations?
Finally, after analysing trust in the context of advanced systems theory as
well as with respect to the special categories of ‘strangers’, the system of
the welfare state and care, I am able to critically analyse the functions and
importance of the Luhmannian concepts of trust and confidence. Here the
3

Tore Bakken and Tor Hernes’ book Autopoietic Organization Theory (2003) is very
impressive, as it concretises the role of organisations in Luhmann’s systems-theoretical
thinking. The authors provide useful insights in two respects: they elucidate Luhmann’s
general ideas in the specific context of organisations, and they demonstrate how our
understanding of organisations can benefit from these ideas (see Bakken and Hernes 2003;
2003b). I have adapted these findings for understanding the emergence and functions of the
systems of the welfare state and care, as well as their connections to Luhmann’s theory of
trust.

11

<-----Page 25----->important questions are as follows: Why did Luhmann not extensively
examine trust in his advanced systems-theoretical writings? What are the
consequences of the ‘disappearance’ of trust (and confidence), and what, in
the end, does trust as a decision mean?

12

<-----Page 26----->2. Luhmann’s Conception of Trust
As noted in chapter one, Luhmann himself did not extensively discuss the
concept of trust in the context of his advanced systems theory, a gap which
the current work tries to fill. In order to be able to analyse the topic in the
context of advanced systems theory, I will first examine Luhmann’s own
analysis of trust. Luhmann’s most important text on trust, Vertrauen (1968),
has been important for the reception of Luhmann’s work by Englishspeaking readers, since it was translated into English already in 1979.
Luhmann’s other text dealing directly with the problems of trust Familiarity, Confidence, Trust. Problems and Alternatives (1988) – can be
seen as his answer to the growing discussion of the problems of trust in the
midst of English-speaking sociologists in the 1980s.4 For one reason or
another, this article does not seem to follow the systems-theoretical
approach of Soziale Systeme, but is mainly based to the findings of
Vertrauen. The greatest incentives for Luhmann to examine trust were the
facts that 1) the concept of trust has never been a topic of mainstream
theoretical sociology, 2) social psychology has placed too great an
emphasis on the role of consciousness and has made no difference between
familiarity, trust and confidence, and 3) empirical research has perceived
trust too generally.
Neither classical authors nor modern sociologists use the term in a
theoretical context. For this reason the elaboration of theoretical
frameworks, one of the main sources of conceptual clarification, has been
relatively neglected. Furthermore, empirical research – for example,
research about trust and distrust in politics – has relied on rather general
4

Familiarity, Confidence and Trust (1988) was influenced largely by Bernard Barber’s
The Logic and Limits of Trust (1983). Barber reviewed the manifestations of trust in
various institutional and professional domains of modern society, and proposed a useful
typology based on the kind of expectations that trust involves. He proposed to distinguish
between three different dimensions in which trusting expectations may fail: the continuity
of the natural and the moral order, the technical competence of actors in roles, and the
fiduciary obligations of actors. Although this distinction refers to the content of
expectations and causes of disappointment, it does not consider the functions of trust. As
Luhmann (1988, 95) notes: “It leaves unspecified, however, the social mechanisms which
generate trust in spite of possible disappointment. It is this question, and in a more general
sense the problem of the function of trust, which is my primary interest, and which leads to
a different approach to conceptual problems.”

13

<-----Page 27----->and unspecified ideas, confusing problems of trust with positive or negative
attitudes toward political leadership or political institutions, with alienation
(itself a multidimensional concept), with hopes and worries, or with
confidence. (Luhmann 1988, 1.)
Luhmann’s aim was to examine the function of trust and the social
mechanisms through which trust is generated. Furthermore, he wanted to
avoid confusion between familiarity, confidence and trust, which before
Luhmann had been considered synonymous in sociology.5 His starting point
was to specify the reason why society in general needs trust. Luhmann
(1979, 4) admitted that there cannot be a society without trust, because
“trust is a basic fact of social life” and a complete absence of trust would
prevent us even from getting up in the morning. Trust is something that we
can affect. The necessity of trust can also be regarded as an appropriate
starting point for the derivation of rules for proper conduct, or for ways of
acting successfully in the world of complexity and uncertainty.
Complexity, and the capacity for dealing with it, however, is not just the
hidden motive, the unifying purpose behind the whole conceptual
orientation of the functional method; it is at the same time the most
fundamental substantive problem for functional research. It is only from the
standpoint of its uttermost complexity that it is worthwhile attacking the
problem of the world as a whole, the universal horizon of all human
experience. Since it has no boundaries, it is not a system. There being
nothing external to it, it cannot be threatened. Even radical changes in its
form of energy can only be interpreted as internal events. (Luhmann 1979,
5.)
Luhmann defines the concept of complexity in very abstract terms. It can be
defined “in terms of a distinction between system and environment and in
terms of a system’s potential for actualization” (Luhmann 1979, 6).
“Complexity itself designates a unity that acquires meaning only in
reference to difference, indeed in reference to the difference of system and
environment” (Luhmann 1989, 11). The starting point of Luhmann’s
5
Georg Simmel has discussed the differences between trust and confidence already before
Luhmann, and has influenced Luhmann’s way to conceive trust. For Simmel, trust
represents a force that works for and through individuals, but at the same time for and
through human association more generally. This latter type of trust is in this work
understood as confidence. (See Möllering 2001.)

14

<-----Page 28----->definition of the concept of complexity, is the distinction between a system
and its environment. By increasing its internal complexity, a system is able
to reduce complexity in the relation between itself and its environment.
This pertains to two different levels of system-environment relations.
Firstly, the societal subsystems (politics, economy, law, etc.) can
concurrently reduce the complexity of the environment of the whole
society. In other words, the more complex a society becomes through
functional differentiation, the better it is able to reduce the complexity of
the environment. Secondly, a subsystem can reduce the complexity of its
own environment within society. For example, by increasing its internal
differentiation the economic subsystem can reduce the complexity of the
relations between itself and the other subsystems (which, in this respect,
form its environment).
However, there are no comprehensive means to eliminate and control
complexity, or any rules for an increase of complexity. This is because for
any system the environment is always more complex than the system itself.
“No system can maintain itself by means of a point-for-point correlation
with its environment, i.e., can summon enough to ‘requisite variety’ to
match its environment” (Luhmann 1989, 11). Each system has to “reduce
environmental complexity – primarily by restricting the environment itself
and perceiving it in a categorically preformed way” (Luhmann 1989, 12). In
conditions of increasing social complexity human beings can and must
develop more effective ways of reducing complexity.
The world is overwhelmingly complex for every kind of real system,
whether it consists of physical or biological units, of rocks, plants or
animals. Its possibilities exceed those to which the system has the capacity
to respond. A system locates itself in a selectively constituted
‘environment’ and will disintegrate in the case of disjunction between
environment and ‘world’. Human beings, however, and they alone, are
conscious of the world’s complexity and therefore of the possibility of
selecting their environment – something which poses fundamental
questions of self-preservation. Man has the capacity to comprehend the
world, can see alternatives, possibilities, can realize his own ignorance, and
can perceive himself as one who must make decisions. (Luhmann 1979, 6.)
15

<-----Page 29----->Following Luhmann, I would say that one such decision, through which one
can ‘organise’, ‘direct’ or reduce complexity, is the decision to trust.
“Where there is trust there are increased possibilities for experience and
action, there is an increase in the complexity of the social system and also
in the number of possibilities which can be reconciled with its structure,
because trust is an effective form of complexity reduction” (Luhmann 1979,
8). Before turning in greater depth to the problematics of trust I will
consider the concept of familiarity.

From Familiarity to Trust
Can I trust that tomorrow the sun will rise again? Can I trust that after the
last of December will come a New Year? The answer is obvious: yes. These
are familiar things and “familiarity is an unavoidable fact of human life”
(Luhmann 1988, 95.) These are things, whose meanings have not been very
much changed during the evolution. All that is familiar is self-evident or
‘taken for granted’. What is familiar is not complex. The familiar world is
consistently anonymous and latent, the full range of experiential
possibilities which it allows – the extreme complexity of the world – will be
excluded from consciousness. This means that the familiar world is
relatively simple. (Luhmann 1979, 19.)
Familiarity presupposes asymmetric relations between a system and its
environment. “Familiarity draws the (asymmetric) distinction between
familiar and unfamiliar fields and puts up with the familiar. The unfamiliar
remains opaque.” (Luhmann 1988, 99.) In ancient societies life was based
on this type of distinctions. The difference between the familiar and the
unfamiliar was controlled by religion, and there was no need for conscious
self-reflection. However, in the course of time, contingency increased and
new control techniques were required for coping with problems of
familiarity, trust and confidence. If we agree with Luhmann, that the
function of trust is to reduce complexity, there is no place for trust in the
familiar world. According to Luhmann (1979, 18):
16

<-----Page 30----->In familiar world everybody is presupposed and co-experienced as sharing
the same formal, empty entity of another ego, as being another ‘I’, and
impersonal ‘one’. There is consequently no differentiation in the operation
of constituting meaning and world, which brings everybody together in a
diffuse consensus. Up to this point, no special need for trust in one’s
fellow-man arises.
For Luhmann, trust includes a future orientation. But at the same time, he
admits, that there cannot be a future without a past. Therefore, “trust is only
possible in a familiar world; it needs history as a reliable background”
(Luhmann 1979, 20). It sounds paradoxical that first Luhmann insists there
would be no need for trust in a familiar world but immideately after this the
place of trust would, it appears, be in the familiar world. However, it must
be noted that for Luhmann, familiarity is the precondition for trust. They
are “complementary ways of absorbing complexity and are linked to one
another, in the same ways as past and future are linked” (Luhmann 1979,
20). We cannot trust each other without this essential basis and without all
previous experiences.
As noted above, Luhmann is convinced that complexity cannot be
eliminated but it is possible to reduce it. When the complexity in the
environment within society grows, social order simultaneously becomes
more variable. Luhmann’s ‘recipe’ for taming the complexity is connected
with the growing importance of trust. In order to be able to reduce the
complexity, we must turn our eyes to the future.
Yet the very complexity of the social order creates a greater need for coordination and hence a need to determine the future – i.e. a need for trust, a
need which is now decreasingly met by familiarity. In these circumstances,
familiarity and trust must seek a new mutually stabilizing relationship
which is no longer grounded in a world which is immediately experienced,
assured by tradition, and close at hand. (Luhmann 1979, 20.)
Luhmann does not mean that this would entail the disappeareance of
familiarity. But he wants to distinguish the problem of trust from the
general familiarity of the world we live in. The overall, anonymously
17

<-----Page 31----->generated familiarity of the world, including nature and human
relationships, which is constructed in generalised terms, is and will continue
to be the self-evident ground of being, the practical basis for all intentional
approaches to specific problems of trust. Familiarity is the prerequisite for
trust, “but man does not see the intersubjective constitution of this basis,
nor does he perceive it as a problem unless he is in the position of having to
turn this familiarity with the objective world into trust in the process of its
intersubjective constitution” (Luhmann 1979, 21).
Readiness to trust is thus bound to familiarity. In addition to familiarity, in
Luhmann’s view self-confidence is another prerequisite for trust.
Experience of everyday life tells us that people are more willing to trust if
they possess inner security, if they have some sort of an indwelling selfconfidence which enables them to anticipate possible disappointments of
trust with composure, without turning what is merely a conceivable
possibility immediately into grounds for action. Self-confidence makes it
easier for people to trust each other; it can be seen as an inner mechanism,
which (in addition to familiarity) makes trust possible. Besides, through
self-confidence it is possible to solve the problems of complexity if the
reduction of complexity through trust has been impossible.
From the functional point of view, self-confidence as a foundation for trust
is to be traced back to the availability of internal mechanisms for the
reduction of complexity. Trust can come about if these internal reduction
mechanisms are stabilized in such a way that they complement the
environmental reduction and thus are in a position to reinforce it at critical
points. In other words, trusting is made possible and easy by the fact that
the trusting system has inner resources available which are not structurally
tied up, and which in the case of a disappointment of trust can be put into
action and take over the burden of the reduction of complexity and the
solving of problems. (Luhmann 1979, 80.)

18

<-----Page 32----->Trust and Take a Risk
Following Luhmann, then, in a complex society there is a growing need for
trust. It is needed in interpersonal relations. Trust, for Luhmann, is
principally interpersonal. This means, that the other person (alter ego) is the
fellow-begetter of complexity and fellow-dethroner of familiarity, but at the
same time, paradoxically, the source for reducing this complexity and the
source of trust. As Luhmann (1979, 22) puts it:
[Trust] serves to overcome an element of uncertainty in the behaviour of
other people which is experienced as the unpredictability of change in
object. In so far as the need for complexity grows, and in so far as the other
person enters the picture both as alter ego and as fellow-author of this
complexity and of its reduction, trust has to be extended, and the original
unquestionable familiarity of the world suppressed, although it cannot be
eliminated completely.
Interpersonal trust, following Luhmann, goes beyond the information it
receives and risks defining the future. It must be noted that in sociology
trust or at least its perception is very modern. Traditionally, the use of
familiar terms for coping with the unfamiliar has been the province of
religion. Trust is intensively bound to risk, whose perception is also quite
modern. Since the early modern time the relationship between trust and risk
has affected our decisions, and consequently detracted the effectiveness of
familiarity and religion in our decision making. Although there is an
obvious connection between trust and risk already in Vertrauen, in
Familiarity, Confidence and Trust Luhmann specifies the connection
between trust and risk.
Only in early modern times did a new term (riesgo, rischio, risk) appear to
indicate that unexpected results may be a consequence of our decisions, and
not simply an aspect of cosmology, an expression of the hidden meanings
of nature nor the hidden intentions of God. This discovery of ‘risk’ as a
general feature of life – roughly replacing what had previously been know
as fortuna – does not facilitate the task of religion, but it adds another
dimension to human experience. It becomes ever more typical and
understandable that decisions cannot avoid risk. Such awareness of risk –
the risks of technological development or of investment, or marriage or of
19

<-----Page 33----->prolonged education – is now a very familiar aspect of everyday life, but it
does not necessarily convey a cosmological or religious meaning. Secrecy,
and therefore dissimulation and distrust, are no longer the essence of life
and of prudence, but trust is bestowed at your own risk. (Luhmann 1988,
96).
Risks are now basic aspects of everyday life. Trust is a risky investment. To
trust is to take a risk.6

“The world is being dissipated into an

uncontrollable complexity; so much so that any given time people are able
to choose freely between very different actions” (Luhmann 1979, 24). Risks
exist only as a component of decision and action. They do not exist in
themselves. It is a purely internal calculation of external conditions which
creates risk. As Luhmann (1988, 97-100) notes:
Trust presupposes a situation of risk... Trust is based on a circular relation
between risk and action, both being complementary requirements. Action
defines itself in relation to a particular risk as external (future) possibility,
although risk at the same time is inherent in action and exists only if the
actor chooses to incur the chance of unfortunate consequences and to trust.
This means that in making a decision concerning trust, we must make a
distinction: to trust or not to trust. Trust, as stated above, is a decision. It is
present only when the expectation to trust makes a difference to a decision,
otherwise what we have is a simple hope. “One who hopes simply has
confidence despite uncertainty. Trust reflects contingency. Hope ignores
contingency7.” (Luhmann 1979, 24.)
6
It should be noted here that Luhmann’s wider analyses of risk, Soziologie des Risikos
(1991), was published over twenty years after Vertrauen. But it seems that the ‘early’ risk
connected to trust in Vertrauen might well have the same characteristics as the ‘later’ risk
analysed in Soziologie des Risikos. In this book, Luhmann sets out to explain the social
phenomenon of risk by examining ‘risk communication’. Risk turns to the conceptual
distinction risk/danger, which sees risk defined as “loss which social processes attribute to
decisions” and danger as origins in cases where “future losses are seen not at all as the
consequences of a decision that has been made, but are attributed to an external factor”
(Luhmann 1993, 101-102). Luhmann’s concern is in observing the observers’ future
uncertainty and describing how in modern society the concept of risk is used for linking
what might happen in the future with present decision-making. Also the trust-risk
relationship in Vertrauen is linked to the future through present decision-making.
Therefore, it can be concluded that Luhmann’s ‘early’ conception of risk has many similar
features with his ‘later’ concept of risk.
7
Here Luhmann speaks about the classic concept of contingency. Something is contingent
insofar as it is neither necessary nor impossible. I will offer a more detailed examination of
the problematics of contingency and double contingency in chapter four.

20

<-----Page 34----->Trust is bound to time in more ways than one. In each system the present is
no longer the present once something is seen as having changed. When we
have decided to trust we have taken a risk, and it is too late to cancel the
decision. A decision to trust requires, then, previous experiences, the
present, and the future.
The complexity of the future world is reduced by the act of trust. In
trusting, one engages in action as though there were only certain
possibilities in the future. The actor binds his future-in-the-present to his
present-in-the-future. In this way he offers other people a determinate
future, a common future, which does not emerge directly from the past they
have in common but which contains something comparatively new.
(Luhmann 1979, 20.)
The same also applies to distrust. Following Luhmann (1979, 71), “distrust
is not just opposite to trust; it is also a functional equivalent of trust. For
this reason only is a choice between trust and distrust possible (and
necessary).” This functional equivalence means that the reduction of
complexity is possible also through negative expectations, that is to say,
distrust. Very often it is even the case that the “substantial injections of
distrust are needed” because it keeps us alert and capable of innovations,
“not to fall back into the customary pedestrian ways of relying on one
another” (Luhmann 1979, 91). Trust and distrust are thus also connected to
each other. They are bound to the situation of decision – affected by
previous experiences, the present as well as the future – in which one would
be functionally a more rational choice than the other. However, it can be
said that choosing to trust makes the decision-maker more ‘vulnerable’ and
this is why trust especially must receive greater theoretical consideration.

21

<-----Page 35----->The Four Conditions of Interpersonal Trust
As noted above, for Luhmann, trust is primarily interpersonal. Only free
human beings are capable of reducing or reconstructing complexity. As
Luhmann (1979, 39) puts it:
Trust is extended first and foremost to another human being, in that he is
assumed to possess a personality, to constitute an ordered, not arbitrary,
centre of a system of action, with which one can come to terms. Trust, then,
is the generalized expectation that the other will handle his freedom, his
disturbing potential for diverse action, in keeping with his personality – or,
rather, in keeping with the personality which he has presented and made
socially visible.
When it comes to trust, one chooses an action in preference to others in
spite of the possibility of being disappointed by those in whom we have put
our trust. When we trust someone, it is possible for him to abuse our trust. I
would even say that by trusting we ‘break’ familiarity. According to
Luhmann (1979, 42-43, 62) personal trust has four conditions8:
1. The process of trust demands mutual commitment and can only be put to
test by both sides becoming involved in it, in a fixed order: First, the truster
and then the trustee.
2. The participants must know the exact situation and they must know from
one another that each one knows it. The building up of trust therefore
depends on easily interpretable situations and, therefore, not least on the
possibility of communication (‘the rule of situation’).
3. It is not possible to demand the trust of others; trust can only be offered and
accepted.
4. Trust has to be earned.
It follows from these conditions that there has to be some cause for
displaying trust. Building trust always requires at least two actors and

22

<-----Page 36----->because of this, mutual commitment is an absolute precondition for trust. In
addition to this, “there has to be defined some situation in which the person
trusting is dependent on his partner; otherwise the problem does not arise.
His behaviour must then commit him to the situation and make him run the
risk of his trust being betrayed.” (Luhmann 1979, 42.) As already
mentioned, it is always possible for the partner to abuse the trust.
How does ‘the rule of situation’, the second one of the four conditions for
personal trust outlined above, work? The actors who engage in the process
of trust have to recognise the situations that involve trust. These kinds of
situations can be recognised only if they are familiar (easily interpretable)
and there also have to be possibilities of communication. Communication9
and action play an important role in building interpersonal trust. They can
also be harmless and cause risks, because all communication says
something about the person who is behaving in a certain way. Therefore,
communication is a risky undertaking which requires some kind of
safeguard. “An individual’s behaviour always gives away more information
about himself than he can reconcile with his ideal self and more than he
consciously wants to communicate. Thus, his mere appearance presumes
some minimum trust, trust that he will not be misinterpreted but that he will
be accepted by and large as what he wishes to appear”. (Luhmann 1979,
40.) I would say that this minimum trust is closely connected with the
feelings of familiarity and self-confidence.
Trusting should also be voluntary. Only the initiator may confer trust, or
perhaps utilise an opportunity raised by chance, to show himself
trustworthy. Following Luhmann, trust is not primarily bound to norms,
8

As we can see by looking at these conditions, the concept of trust has similar
characteristics with the concept of contract. However, unlike contracts, trust is not based
on formal or juridical logic.
9
As we see, Luhmann stresses already in Vertrauen the role of communication, which
became later one of the major elements of advanced systems theory. However, in
Vertrauen Luhmann (1979, 40) grasps communication only as a “perceivable form of
behaviour”, whereas in the context of advanced systems theory it is the other meaningprocessing system and consists of three different selections: information, utterance and
understanding.

23

<-----Page 37----->because trust relationships do not follow from previous prescriptions but are
tied to future and risks. If anything, trust relationships cause norms to
emerge. “The truster sees in his own vulnerability the instrument whereby a
trust relationship may be created. Only his own original trust offers him the
possibility of putting it forward as a norm that his trust is not to be
disappointed, and thus bringing the other over to his side.” (Luhmann 1979,
43). Moreover, the earning of trust means that whoever wants to win trust
must take part in social life and be in a position to build the expectations of
the other into his own self-presentation. Whoever presents himself from the
outset as unapproachable (for example by walking past really quickly or by
snubbing), distances himself in this way and therefore is in no position to
acquire trust because he offers no opportunities for learning and testing.
(Luhmann 1979, 62.)

‘In Functions We Have System Trust’
However, personal trust is not enough to explain the wider processes of
trusting. Social order and reducing complexity do not stand and fall by the
few people one communicates with and trusts. There must thus be other
ways of building up trust, which do not depend on the personal element.
This is where system trust comes to play.
In simple social systems (like tribes) the model of living was largely
established by means of religiously based assumptions about real existence,
nature and supernatural, by means of myth, language, and natural law. The
right ordering of things was taken as normative and established as
trustworthy. In this type of systems, complexity was excluded and norms
were enough to guarantee the stability of everyday life. As Luhmann (1979,
48) notes: “No impersonal forms of trust were required. Whenever it was
necessary to communicate, or to explain this order of things, this was
achieved via the authority of gods, saints or knowledgeable interpreters
trusted as persons.”
24

<-----Page 38----->In today’s functionally differentiated society the situation is different. The
religious system cannot alone guarantee the order of society. Society
consists of many systems and many differentiated media of communication;
there is no central system that could direct others. Therefore, there are as
many logics of system trust as there are systems.
[Because of these systems] the need for the social capacity for selection to
be connected with the scale of the individual’s ability to take decisions and
to act becomes a more complex and differentiated affair. The differentiated
media of communication, their language and their symbols, bring new sorts
of risk and thus pose a new type of problem in regard to trust. (Luhmann
1979, 49.)
Following Luhmann, behind system trust functions a tactical and supportive
perspective. Anyone who trusts in a system basically assumes that the
system is functioning and places his trust in that function, not in people
(Luhmann 1979, 50). In system trust there is no interpersonal mutual trust
relations but system trust – like familiarity – functions beyond trust. For
example, system trust in the economic system functions in the following
way:
Anyone who trusts in the stability of the value of money, and the continuity
of a multiplicity of opportunities for spending it, basically assumes that a
system is functioning and places his trust in that function, not in people.
Such system trust is automatically built up through continual, affirmative
experience in utilizing money. It needs constant feedback, but does not
require specific built-in guarantees. (Luhmann 1979, 50.)
This means that we know how the medium of money is functioning and we
trust its functionality. The more we have money, the more we have
opportunities to take part of the ‘actions’ of the economic system and at the
same time ‘illustrate’ our trust in its function. This type of system trust is
easier to acquire than personal trust. On the other hand, it is much more
difficult to control because it does not depend only on two communicative
actors but is tied to complex processes of society. Moreover, “trust in the
large reduction mechanisms is so inevitable that it need not be consciously
perceived as a subjective activity which one can continue or drop, as in the
25

<-----Page 39----->case of personal trust. Thus system trust hardly becomes an open matter for
public discussion, and, again, the fact that it is something latent helps
maintain its integrity.” (Luhmann 1979, 57.) I would like to note that in
some cases, system trust can also be a substitute for personal trust. For
example, anyone who has enough money or power has no intense need to
trust others. He is thus able to reduce complexity by means of money or
power. In other words, he trusts that he can solve the problems by means of
the capacity of money or power he has.
However, this is not the whole truth about system trust. In Familiarity,
Confidence and Trust: Problems and Alternatives (1988) Luhmann
completes his opinion of system trust by theorising the concept of
confidence. Some scholars (for example Seligman10) take Luhmann’s
concepts of system trust and confidence to be almost synonymous. In
contrast to their opinions, I would like to argue that there is a subtle
difference between the topics. Confidence is already a more systemstheoretically advanced concept than system trust. For example, Luhmann
no longer sees such a compact connection between confidence and risk as
there was between system trust and risk, and stresses the difference between
a system and its environment more strongly than before. If anything,
confidence is bound to danger more than risk. Like familiarity, confidence
also presupposes an asymmetric relation between system and environment,
and is therefore a mode of asserting expectations of self-assurance. As
Luhmann

(1988,

99)

says:

“Confidence…emerges

in

situations

characterized by contingency and danger, which makes it meaningful to
reflect on pre-adaptive and protective measures. The source of
disappointment may be social action. Anticipation therefore differentiates
between social actors”. Although there are different types of anticipations
and disappointments, our behaviour is controlled (mainly) by (systems of)
10

According to Adam Seligman (1997, 19), what Luhmann in his earlier work - Vertrauen
(1968) - terms “system trust” approximates in his later work - Familiarity, Confidence,
Trust: Problems and Alternatives (1988) - to “confidence”. Seligman’s opinion is thus
different from mine. He does not want to separate system trust and confidence at all from
each other.

26

<-----Page 40----->politics and law. In other words, in dangerous and contingent situations we
can have confidence in functions of different systems, which in turn reduce
the complexity of their environment within society through their systemenvironment relation.
This does not mean that systems would be stable. The complexity of some
system’s environment might endanger its function and programmes. For
example, high unemployment rates can affect the workings of the political
system. In this type of situation, the political system’s system-environment
relation can change, which in turn may cause new dangers, affect our
confidence in the functions of the system, and have an effect on our ability
to make risk-based decisions. However, these are risks (or dangers) to
which a person is unavoidably exposed, and not those to which a person
exposes oneself intentionally (as it is in interpersonal trust situations).
Therefore, it can be said that the difference between danger and risk is not
distinctive. Rather, risk decisions contain always the reflection of danger. In
general, however, in Familiarity, Confidence and Trust Luhmann still
proceeds in the line of the old division – there is confidence in the system
and trust in partners – but goes more deeply into his analyses of the
connections and differences between familiarity, trust and confidence than
he does in Vertrauen.

Differences and Connections between Familiarity, Trust and
Confidence
Familiarity is a precondition for trust but also for confidence. The
conditions of familiarity have been dramatically changed over the ages by
the invention of writing, by literacy, by printing press and the development
of information technology. The social world can no longer be completely
reconstructed by the division of familiarity/unfamiliarity.
The world itself could be compared to a book, written by God in partly
illegible letters; and immediately Protestants, philosophers, and scientists
27

<-----Page 41----->began to read it in different ways. The unfamiliar no longer screens off
possible dissensus, tension, and conflict. The social world is reconstructed
in terms of ‘interests’. Now, you may try to calculate and to outwit
interests; you may see ways to use the interests of others which are reliable
precisely because they are interests. (Luhmann 1988, 101.)
The distinction of familiar and unfamiliar becomes more or less blurred.
Risks, complexity and the growing importance of interests emphasise the
need of confidence and trust. Therefore, “confidence and trust are the
decisive issues, and familiarity survives as a purely private milieu without
function for society as a whole.” (Luhmann 1988, 102). However, I would
like to remind that we cannot totally forget the role of familiarity in a
complex society. Unlike Luhmann, I would say that familiarity has a
function because it functions as a precondition for trust and confidence.
The concepts of trust and confidence refer to a set of expectations which
may lapse into disappointments. The normal case is that of confidence. You
are confident that your expectations will not be disappointed: that
aeroplanes do not fall, that politicians are not corrupted and that nobody
tries to kill you on your Sunday afternoon walk. It can be said that
confidence is a matter of routine and normal behaviour. Confidence
depends on inherent danger but not always on risk. However, there are
always contingent events that you cannot know beforehand. Therefore, you
neglect the possibility of disappointment. “You neglect this because it is a
very rare possibility, but also because you do not know what else to do.The
alternative is to live in a state of permanent uncertainty and to withdraw
expectations without having anything with which to replace them”.
(Luhmann 1988, 97.)
To trust, as stated above, is to take a risk. It requires a previous engagement
on your part. Trust depends not on inherent danger but on risk. Risks,
however, emerge only as a component of decision and action. They do not
exist by themselves. For example, you may or may not buy a car which
turns out to be a ‘lemon’. “You can avoid taking the risk, but only if you are
willing to waive the associated advantages…If you refrain from action you
28

<-----Page 42----->run no risk. It is a purely internal calculation of external conditions which
creates risk.” (Luhmann 1988, 97; 100). The distinction between trust and
confidence depends on perceptions and attribution.
If you do not consider alternatives (every morning you leave the house
without a weapon), you are in a situation of confidence. If you choose one
action in preference to others in spite of the possibility of being
disappointed by the action of others, you define the situation as one of trust.
In the case of confidence you will react to disappointment by external
attribution. In the case of trust you will have choice. (Luhmann 1988, 97.)
Confidence is thus connected to danger and not necessarily to risk as it
were in the case of system trust. Furthermore, it seems that in Vertrauen
Luhmann somehow still tried to match up system trust with interpersonal
relations. More precisely, Luhmann (1979, 58; 22) says that “system trust
counts on explicit processes for the reduction of complexity, i.e. on people,
not nature” and that “system trust is not only applicable to social systems
but also to other people as personal systems”. In Familiarity, Confidence
and Trust (1988) Luhmann evidently stresses the difference between
system and environment as well as the growing importance of functional
systems more than he does in Vertrauen. Through these theoretical
improvements the division between trust and confidence (or system trust)
also becomes more evident.
Essential structures and territorially bounded cultural entities are largely
displaced by time-limited entities such as fashion and style. These new
conditions, of access and temporal pressure, of opportunity and
dependence, of openness and lack of intergration, change the relation
between confidence and trust. Trust remains vital in interpersonal relations,
but participation in functional systems like the economy or politics is no
longer a matter of personal relations. It requires confidence, but not trust.
(Luhmann 1988, 102.)
What are, then, the connections between trust and confidence? Modern life
is characterised by the inclusion of persons in important functional systems
like economy, politics and law. One cannot avoid participation in these
systems because “at the level of social inclusion there is no choice of opting
in or opting out; nor is it a question of being well born or of being
29

<-----Page 43----->‘elected’” (Luhmann 1988, 103). Because we participate in functional
systems, they depend not only on confidence but also on trust. Lack of
confidence might mean dissatisfaction with some system. If someone has
lost his confidence in some system (for example politics), this usually has
no immediate impact on the functions of the system. If trust is lacking, the
situation is different. This is because the development of trust (and distrust)
depends on local milieu and personal experience. These conditions may be
extended by television or newspapers, for instance in the case of political
leaders. People might lose their trust in political leaders, which, in turn, can
increase dissatisfaction with the political system. “A lack of confidence
may mean, without further reflection, a lack of trust, and lack of trust means
that behaviour which presupposes trust will be ruled out” (Luhmann 1988,
103). Thus, a lack of confidence and a need for trust may form a vicious
circle. Confidence needs trust and vice versa.
A system – economic, legal, or political – requires trust as an input
condition. Without trust it cannot stimulate supportive activities in
situations of uncertainty or risk. At the same time, structural and
operational properties of such a system may erode confidence and thereby
undermine one of the essential conditions of trust. (Luhmann 1988, 103.)
Although confidence needs trust and vice versa, Luhmann insists that this
does not lead to the conclusion that the distinction between confidence and
trust is obsolete. A lack of confidence will ultimately lead to feelings of
alienation. Or, as Luhmann (1988, 103) puts it, “if there is a lack of
confidence there will also be a diffuse sentiment of dissatisfaction and
alienation or even anomie”. A lack of trust, on the other hand, simply
withdraws activities.
[The lack of trust] reduces the range of possibilities for rational action. It
prevents, for example, early medication. It prevents, above all, capital
investment under conditions of uncertainty and risk. It may lead to a bad
life in moral terms, because one no longer expects to be rewarded after
death. It may reduce public interest in innovative art which is not yet
recognized and confirmed by the establishment of experts. Through lack of
trust a system may lose size; it may even shrink below a critical threshold
30

<-----Page 44----->necessary for its own reproduction at a certain level of development.
(Luhmann 1988, 104.)
To conclude, for Luhmann, familiarity, confidence (or system trust), and
trust are different modes of asserting expectations. Our ability and
willingness to trust other people and have confidence in different systems
are not self-evident things but need familiarity as their historical
background. Familiarity is connected to a past and functions as a
precondition for trust and confidence. In addition to familiarity, we need
self-confidence in order to be able to trust. It can be seen as a type of
internal mechanism of a human being, which enables the reduction of
complexity. However, living in a totally familiar world is no longer
possible, or at least it is very rare. This is because in today’s society we are
dependent on other people and different function systems. Thus trust and
confidence, and not familiarity, are the decisive issues.
The decision to trust is always oriented towards the future; to trust it is to
take a risk. The process of trust demands at least two persons: the truster
and the trustee. We cannot force anybody to trust us, trust has to be earned.
It is also always possible for the other to abuse the trust. The development
of trust (or distrust) is thus personal and local.
Personal trust is not enough to explain the wider trust processes. Following
Luhmann, social reality is not only dependent on persons but also on
functional systems. We are participants in many systems (like economy,
politics, law etc.) with which we cannot have an interpersonal relationship.
But in order to be able to act within the context of these systems, we must
have confidence (or system trust) in their functions. This type of confidence
or system trust is general, not personal or local. Therefore confidence is
easier to acquire than personal trust but also much more difficult to control.
Confidence (or system trust) in a system and trust in partners are different
attitudes with respect to alternatives, but they may influence each other.
This is because confidence, which functions on a systemic level, requires
31

<-----Page 45----->trust as an input condition. Interpersonal and local trust thus strengthens the
systemic confidence. At the same time, then, confidence can to stimulate a
persons’ activities in situations of uncertainty and risk. It could be said that
confidence functions as a background noise for trust. At the same time,
however, this noise is not possible without risk-taking interpersonal
communication, i.e. trust. Confidence needs trust and vice versa. Together
they prevent anomie and enhance the range of possibilities for rational
action.

32

<-----Page 46----->3. Luhmann’s Theory of Trust in Context:
Theoretical Precursors and Current Influence
Having analysed Luhmann’s own writings of trust, I shall now move on to
explore Talcott Parsons’ and Georg Simmel’s classical theories of trust,
which acted as major sociological influences for Luhmann’s own writings
concerning the topic. It was Talcott Parsons, whose writings about systems
and trust can be seen as the most important starting point for Luhmann’s
research on trust. Another sociologist who undoubtedly affected Luhmann
was Georg Simmel. As Guido Möllering (2001, 408) says: “ If social
scientists today are at all aware of Simmel as a source on trust, then it
appears to be mainly due to Niklas Luhmann.”
I shall also look into why some well-known psychological and
philosophical accounts on trust do not play an influential role in Luhmann’s
trust research. Furthermore, I shall also examine how Luhmann’s theory of
trust has affected the recent sociological writings of trust. In particular, I
shall concentrate on Anthony Giddens’ and Piotr Sztompka’s approaches,
which have been remarkably influenced by Luhmann. Their approaches –
like Luhmann’s – are also theoretically oriented. That is to say that
especially Giddens, and partly Sztompka as well, have not really
problematised the origin, culture or empirical use of trust but rather
concentrate on the theoretical functions of trust.

Parsons: Trust as a Part of Familiarity
The most important sociological influence for Luhmann’s theory of trust
came certainly from his teacher, Talcott Parsons. In 1960 Luhmann went to
Harvard to study sociology with Parsons, discussing particularly the notion
of function with him. During that time, system theoretical sociology was
almost synonymous with Parsons’ (1966) structural functionalism.
Structural functionalism was based on the assumption that social systems
33

<-----Page 47----->could not function and maintain themselves without a normative
foundation. Parsons treats the social system as a part of the primary
subsystems of the human action system. The others are behavioural
organism, individual personality and the cultural system. According to
Parsons (1966, 5): “Action consists of the structures and processes by
which human beings form meaningful intentions and implement them in
concrete situations.”
Every action system has its own functional category. Cultural systems are
specialised in the function of pattern-maintenance. That is to say, they are
concerned with the maintenance of the highest controlling patterns of the
action system. Social systems, on the contrary, are specialised in the internal
integration of acting units (of human individuals) of the system. Finally,
personality systems are specialised in goal attainment in relation to systems
environment and behavioural organisms in adaptation to the non-action,
physical environment. (Parsons 1966, 7.)
In Parsons’ theory, the social system is the integrative sub-system of action
because it is made up of the interaction of human individuals. Each member
is both an actor and an object of orientation both for other actors and for
himself (Parsons 1977, 67). Therefore, because of this connection, each of
the other three action systems (culture11, personality, behavioural organism)
constitutes the environment of a social system. Society is the most selfsufficient type of social systems. Furthermore, the entity that takes care of
integration and norms – and acts as the core of a society – is the societal
collectivity.
The core of a society, as a system, is the patterned normative order through
which the life of a population is collectively organized. As an order, it
contains values and differentiated and particularized norms and rules, all of
which require cultural references in order to be meaningful and legitimate.
As a collectivity, it displays a patterned conception of membership which
11
As a matter of fact, a cultural system is not a ‘pure’ action system. Rather, it is “an
abstract structure of symbolism and meaning, which proceeds from one generation to
another” (Heiskala 1995, 94).

34

<-----Page 48----->distinguishes between those individuals who do and do not belong. (Parsons
1966, 10.)
It seems, then, that a normative system is internally coherent and broadly
shared by its members. The normative rules, which Parsons called
structural imperatives, create the basis for the social processes which form
the structure and activity of a society. These norms and values are
institutionalised in society, or to be more precise, societal collectivity
(Kangas 2001, 296-297). In this collectivity, human beings play their roles
determined by the patterned normative order through which the life of a
population is collectively organised.
In addition to the structure of social processes, normative rules also create
the foundation for social action and proper conduct of an individual, the
socialisation of a human being. Two of the most important institutions
behind socialisation are the family and the school (which are the
subsystems of society). As well as socialising the present generation, they
transmit the normative structure to future generations. That is to say,
socialisation is the product of the cultural system. As Parsons (1966, 6)
notes, no individual social system can create a cultural system. Norms and
values hereby are the controlling part of action and systems today but
socialisation is the part of the past which affects the present as well as the
future. After all, norms and values need socialisation and vice versa.
Parsons’ systems theory is totally bound on normative orientation. If the
control of the norms is enough, is there then any need for trust in Parsons’
systems theory?
To Parsons (1978, 45-46) the problem of trust emerges in relationships
between professionals and lay persons. There is a “competence gap”
between the expert and the layman. Because the layman cannot fully
understand what the professional (for example, a scientist) is doing, there
must be a basis of trusted validation of competence other than the typical
layman’s personal competence to evaluate it. In order for trust to exist
between these persons, they must have common values and common goals.
35

<-----Page 49----->There must also be adequate symbolisation of both competence and
integrity:
Sharing values makes agreement on common goals easier, and ‘confidence’
in competence and integrity makes commitment to mutual involvement in
such goals easier…All these considerations focus mutual trust in the
conception or ‘feeling’ of the solidarity of collective groups. (Parsons 1978,
46-47.)
It thus seems that Parsons grasped trust as a feeling which can be activated
only between the members of a collective group who share the same values
and norms. This is to say that there can be trust only inside the societal
collectivity. If norms and values – created by the societal collectivity –
define the limits of its membership, they also define the limits of trust. In
Parsons’ theory trust therefore emerges as a parallel concept to familiarity,
and it is not rational to trust strangers or any people who do not share the
same values, goals or even culture with us.

Luhmann versus Parsons
Although Parsons’ action theory and concept of trust affected Luhmann, he
was not very convinced on their validity in examinating of the modern,
complex society.12 The Parsonsian concept of trust seemed to be too simple
12

It should be mentioned that when Luhmann was in Harvard, Harold Garfinkel elaborated
his view on trust from the grounds of Parsonsian influence. Garfinkel had also been
Parsons’student, but he did not agree with his teacher’s normative systems theory, and
consequently also conceptualised trust in a different manner. Although both Garfinkel and
Luhmann were taught by Parsons and his writings on trust had an important effect for the
work of both on the topic, Garfinkel’s influence on the development of Luhmann’s
conception of trust was not very remarkable. In Vertrauen, for example, Luhmann cites
Garfinkel’s texts only on three occasions.
Garfinkel argues that people conceptualise events in everyday life on the presupposition
that others see things as they do. A common-sense environment is one whose features are
commonly known by social actors. The basis of our common-sense world is a kind of trust
in how things work and what people think. What an event means or what an object is we
cannot determine for ourselves. Understanding, reactions, intentions, and routines must be
shared. The kind of trust presumed in games may also be applied to everyday decisions.
(see Garfinkel 1963.) Deviating from Parsons, Garfinkel does not emphasise the meaning
of norms, but co-ordinated action instead. To be able to co-ordinate their actions, people
have to see the world in parallel ways. Garfinkel’s interest was in common assumptions
about events and responses to them, assumptions that structure our everyday social world
and our responses to it. “He used the notion of trust because of his interest in our confident

36

<-----Page 50----->and norm-oriented13 for Luhmann. As Luhmann (1979, 27) notes, Parsons’
concept of trust (as well as distrust) “is an affective (non-neutral) and
diffuse (non-specific) attitude, according to the way in which an object is
presented, as particular (non-universal) and ascribed (not achieved)”. In
conclusion, this means that trust cannot be neutral, because trust can only
exist between familiar people (we do not trust strangers). Therefore, trust is
also spread because of familiarity. We already know, or feel, the basics of
trust, or the people who are – and who are not – reliable. Thus, in Parsons’
model, the only form of trust is particular, not general. It is also described
because it functions as a crucial element of mutual interaction. The
relationship of trust to an object is independent of specific individual
interests and contexts of experience. I would say that in Parsons’ theory,
trust is a feeling or attitude based on familiarity and common culture, but
activated only by making decisions. Or, as Luhmann (1979, 27) puts it, trust
is an attitude which is neither objective nor subjective; it is not transferable
to other objects or to other people who trust. This kind of attitude or feeling
only affects our mind. Or, saying it as Luhmann would, it is only an
element of our internal systems.
If trust is an attitude or element of internal systems, it has to be learned.
Therefore, trust is also part of socialisation. As said before, socialisation
does not occur by itself, but two of the most important institutions behind it
are the family and the school. Luhmann also admits the connection between
trust and the family, and also emphasises the continuity of the learning
process. Despite Luhmann’s suspicion for the validity of Parsons’ concept
of trust, we have here a clear connection between Parsons and Luhmann. At
expectations about what other people will do, and our mutual dependence. Such trust
enables our social world to make sense.” (Govier 1997, 22.)
13
If Luhmann was dissatisfied with Parsons’ normative orientation, Adam B. Seligman, in
turn, thinks that trust conceived in a Luhmannian way is risky, because it is completely
detached from normative definitions. According to Seligman (1997, 63): “[Luhmann’s]
trust is not only a means of negotiating risk, it implies risk (by definition, if it is a means of
negotiating that which is unknown). The risk implied is precisely that which is inherent in
alter’s realization of agency: were all action circumscribed by role expectations and
normative definitions there would be no risk, only confidence or lack thereof. Trust, by
contrast, implies the risk that is incurred when we cannot expect a return or reciprocal

37

<-----Page 51----->least, we can say that the family’s importance in the process of learning
trust was one of Luhmann’s starting points for studying how trust functions
in society.
[Being a kind of attitude] trust has to be learned...New situations and new
people are continually posing new problems of trust throughout life. The
ways of preparing for relationships of love and friendship, or more
generally for all kinds of personal ties and deepening acquaintanceship, can
be interpreted as the testing and learning of relationships of trust.
Differentiated and mobile social systems set a particularly high standard
which can only be met if learning how to trust, and not just trust by itself,
can be learned. This is part of the socialization function of the family. Nor
would it be too misleading to assume that social systems have to learn trust
as well. (Luhmann 1979, 27-28.)
Furthermore, in Parsonsian language, it could be said that family is a
subsystem of society through which human beings learn the ‘real’ character
of trust. After all, because of common values and norms we know the limits
of trust, but the subsystem through which we learn how and who to trust, is
the family. The aim of trust, then, is to stabilise the changing condition in
societal community. In brief, I would say that the boundaries of a system,
its particular form and the family’s socialising role, were important
milestones in Parsons’ theory of trust. For Luhmann, the boundaries of
system were even more important than for Parsons, because already
Luhmann’s ‘early’ systems theory in the 1960s is a closed systems theory in
which the self-organisation and self-production of the system, and thus also
its boundaries make up two leading principles of the theory. It can be said,
then, that the boundaries of the system were also an important starting point
for Luhmann’s concept of trust. Following Luhmann, there can thus be trust
between personal systems and personal system can have confidence in
functional systems.

action on alter’s part (which we could, at least within certain boundaries, when interaction
is defined solely by the reciprocally defined nature of role obligations and commitments)”.

38

<-----Page 52----->Simmel: Trust as a Feeling and Moral Value
In addition to Parsons, another sociologist who undoubtedly affected
Luhmann was Georg Simmel. Although the contemporary discussion
sometimes overlooks Simmel’s conception of trust, it is obvious that his
work has had a great influence on the development of the sociological
theory of trust. As Barbara Misztal (1996, 49-50) states:
[Simmel’s] contribution to the sociological conceptualisation of this notion
is significant. Many of his brilliant analyses of the nature of trust
relationships were later adopted and developed by scholars such as
Luhmann and Giddens. Simmel's theory of trust provides a theoretical
framework for analysing personal as well as generalised (or impersonal)
trust.
Simmel wrote only three short passages on the subject of trust (one in
Philosophie des Geldes [1900] and two in Soziologie [1908]), altogether no
more than ten pages. Nevertheless, trust played a significant role in
Simmel’s theory. As Simmel (1950, 318) notes, trust is “one of the most
important synthetic forces within society”. Or, “without the general trust
that people have in each other, society itself would disintegrate” (Simmel
1990, 178). Guido Möllering (2001, 405) crystallises Simmel’s concept of
trust in the following manner: trust is a force that works for and through
individuals and at the same time works for and through human association
more generally.
The first source on trust in Simmel’s work is found in his discussion of the
constitution of secret societies. For Simmel, secrecy is a curiosity, a kind of
a third form of ‘the social’, between knowing and not-knowing. In other
words, despite the fact that we don’t possess full information about others,
we establish some kind of estimation of them. Social interaction would be
impossible without this ‘non-knowledge’, since absolute transparency
would make us mad. (Noro 1991, 167.) For this reason, trust becomes an
important notion in Simmel’s theory. In brief, where there is not enough
39

<-----Page 53----->knowledge, we become desperate and call for trust to be able to
communicate the ‘non-knowledge’.
Simmel notes that the first internal relation typical of the secret society is
the reciprocal confidence among its members. He attributes a high moral
value to trust, which makes it a rather special medium of social exchange.
We should also notice that trust is a kind of force that cannot be demanded
by others, but only offered and accepted. This was one of Simmel’s most
important observations and was later adopted by Luhmann, among others
(see Luhmann 1979, 43).
In the confidence of one man in another, lies as high a moral value, as in the
fact that the trusted person shows himself worthy of it. Perhaps it is even
more free and meritorious, since the trust we receive contains an almost
compulsory power, and to betray it requires thoroughly positive meanness.
By contrast, confidence is given; it cannot be requested in the same manner
in which we are requested to honour it, once we are its recipients. (Simmel
1950, 348.)
We can call this kind of mutual confidential force trust. I would even say
that Simmel’s concept of trust is quite close to his concept of fidelity or
loyalty (die Treue). It is a secondary feeling – the social form of the
relationship – which leads to the feeling of gratitude. (See Simmel 1900,
581-582.)14 But there are also confidential relationships which are not
bound to interpersonal and reciprocal ties. As Simmel (1950, 318) says, this
means an “increasing objectification of our culture, whose phenomena
consist more and more of impersonal elements and less and less absorb the
subjective totality of the individual”. This objectification of culture has a
bearing on the constitution of confidence in that less and less personal
knowledge of the other is required for having confidence. In other words,
14
It should be noted here that most of the Simmel specialists – for example Birgitta
Nedelmann and Arto Noro – emphasise that in Simmel’s theory trust is, above all, a feeling
and does not have much to do with moral questions. It is a primary feeling, which can be
paralleled by love, hatred or resentment (see Nedelmann 1983). It is Guido Möllering
(2001, 407) – who goes further in his examination of Simmel’s theory of trust than most
other sociologists – who stresses the role of moral obligation. I would say, following
Möllering, that these moral features of trust somehow distinguish it from the other
Simmelian primary feelings.

40

<-----Page 54----->the traditions and institutions become so reliable that one has to know only
certain external facts about the other person in order to have the confidence
required for common action. For Simmel (1950, 318), confidence (unlike
trust), is “an antecedent or subsequent form of knowledge”. He says that
“confidence is intermediate between knowledge and ignorance about a
man”, which is a logical consequence of the view that a complete
knowledge or ignorance would eliminate the need for, or possibility of,
trust (Simmel 1950, 318).
Following Simmel, we can say that trust is a mutual relationship between
individuals without which the group’s actions would be only fragmentary or
radically episodic. Through the effects of trust, the relationships are
expected to emerge as durable and continuous. Confidence, on the other
hand, does not appear as an effect of mutuality, but is something that the
group already has. It is based on representation. It is thus a moral or
institutional (scientific, political etc.) value which assists in the
development of confidential reciprocal relationships, or trust.
It is now evident that if there is trust between individuals, however, there is
also some kind of confidence which acts beyond the reciprocal
relationships. What makes Simmel’s conception of trust complicated, is that
he presumes a much weaker link between the identifiable bases of trust and
the actual expectations that human beings have when they reach the state of
trust. Simmel recognises a mysterious further element, a kind of faith, that
is required for explaining trust and grasping its unique nature. This element
is difficult to describe and is associated with a state of mind. It has nothing
to do with knowledge, and is both less and more than knowledge.
To ‘believe in someone’, without adding or even conceiving what it is that
one believes about him, is to employ a very subtle and profound idiom. It
expresses the feeling that there exists between our idea of a being and the
being itself a definite connection and unity, a certain consistency in our
conception of it, an assurance and lack of resistance in the surrender of the
Ego to this conception, which may rest upon particular reasons, but is not
explained by them. (Simmel 1990, 179.)
41

<-----Page 55----->It can be noted that the character of this further element is nuanced. People
believe in other human beings differently. The additional quasi-religious
element thus varies in strength and importance. Without this further
element it would be impossible to trust others, but we cannot explain its
structure in epistemological terms. Or, as Simmel (1950, 318) puts it, the
further element “goes back to the metaphysical sense of our relationships
and is realised in a merely empirical, accidental, fragmentary manner by the
conscious and particular reasons for confidence”. It is thus a primary
feeling which does not require (the feeling of) reciprocity. This further
element affects only that which is beyond trust and confidence.

Luhmann versus Simmel
At first glance, it seems that Simmel’s influence does not play an essential
role on Luhmann’s trust research. This is because in Vertrauen, Luhmann
uses only four brief citations from Simmel (Luhmann 1979, 26; 44; 63; 91)
of which the fourth does not even concern trust as such. However, by
examining the matter more closely, one can find some important
connections between Simmel and Luhmann.15
The first point of reference between Simmel and Luhmann concerns the
problem of knowledge and ‘non-knowledge’. Luhmann adopts the notion of
trust as a blending of knowledge and ignorance from Simmel’s Soziologie
(1950, 318). When we do not have enough knowledge, trust seems to be

15
Simmel affected Luhmann in many ways. In many respects Simmel sets out a
functionalist, anti-humanist critique of the core ideas of the Enlightenment which mark
him out as one major sociological precursor of Luhmann. According to Michael King and
Chris Thornhill (2003, 152): “Simmel (like Luhmann) attemps to account for society as a
functionally differentiated reality in which each arena of operation detaches itself from all
mono-focal and mono-causal substance, and so eventually also from the human being
itself. Each arena of functional activity, he explains, generates and perpetuates itself by
promulgating systems of value which no longer have any physical or objective origin in the
human persons, but which create a reality of co-ordinated sense in which functional
interactions can be correlated”.

42

<-----Page 56----->one way to prevent desperation and strengthen self-respect. As Luhmann
(1979, 26) notes:
Trust always extrapolates from the available evidence; it is, as Simmel
pointed out, a blending of knowledge and ignorance. Although the one who
trusts is never at a loss for reasons and is quite capable of giving an account
of why he shows trust in this or that case, the point of such reasons is really
to uphold his self-respect and justify him socially. They prevent him from
appearing to himself and others as a fool, as an inexperienced man illadapted to life, in the event of his trust being abused. At most, they are
brought into account for the placing of trust, but not for trust itself.
Second, for Simmel, the renewal of trust was an important element in
mutual relations. Luhmann also stresses this idea of mutuality and renewal
of trust. As Luhmann (1979, 47) says: “Simmel very rightly points out that
it is the continual problem of always having to renew trust which becomes a
strong binding force”. Simmel disposed the problem of renewing trust by
emphasising its moral force and compulsory features. Trust, as noted above,
can be seen here as the social form of the mutual relationship, which in the
case of fidelity leads to a feeling of gratitude and seems to be quite stabile
and also appears to be the moral force behind the ‘secret society’. For
Luhmann, trust is not a moral and stable element of society. It is not bound
to feelings of gratitude. Rather, in the modern and complex society, mutual
relations “are frequently short, involve different participants, are impersonal
and unlikely to be repeated” (Luhmann 1979, 45). There must therefore be
other ways to renew trust than that of moral force and gratitude.
Third, Luhmann’s concept of trust was undoubtedly influenced by
Simmel’s (1908, [1950]) classical writings about Der Fremde, the stranger.
Unfortunately, Luhmann gives almost no consideration to the problems
between trust and the stranger (a gap which I shall attempt to fill in chapter
six). For Simmel (1950, 402), the stranger is “the potential wanderer”, “the
person who comes today and stays tomorrow” who has not belonged to the
group from the beginning, but imports qualities which do not and cannot
stem from the group itself. Luhmann (1979, 63) refers to Simmel’s theory
of the stranger by noticing, that “it is no accident that sociology of previous
43

<-----Page 57----->generations could see that the untrusted stranger enjoys more freedom and
is able to behave with greater freedom.” Traditionally, sociology believed
that to be trusted by others, a stranger must be around for some time to
become known, and “thus entangle with his self-presentation in a web or
norms which he himself has helped create, and from which he cannot
withdraw without leaving parts of himself behind” (Luhmann 1979, 63).
However, Luhmann emphasises that the function of trust is the reduction of
complexity in the face of the freedom of another person. Therefore, norms
as well as the (traditional) ‘strangeness’ of the other no longer play a vital
role. Rather, the freedom of the other can be seen as a positive starting point
for trust. As Luhmann (1979, 62) notes: “Only trust in the capacity for selfpresentation to be reflected contains a guarantee for suitable continuity of
behaviour under difficult, changing conditions. Only this form of trust
regards the other person truly as free – and not merely as a being with
certain constant characteristics.” Therefore, “whoever wants to win trust
must take part in social life and be in a position to build the expectations of
others into his own self-presentation” (Luhmann 1979, 62).

The Psychological and Philosophical Dimensions of Trust
A majority of the psychological literature on trust is concerned with
psychological correlates of trusting, or rather, of being a high truster as
opposed to a low truster (see, for example, Rotter 1980). But perhaps a
better known part of the psychological literature in this area deals directly
with the development of a capacity or propensity to trust. The simplest
psychological path for such development might merely be a learning model.
Nonetheless, it should be mentioned here, that although trust has played an
important role in psychology, the psychological account was not a
remarkable influence for Luhmann. If anything – significantly from the
perspective of this work – he looked askance at psychological accounts of
trust.
44

<-----Page 58----->In psychology (or psychoanalysis) the concept of trust was analysed by Erik
Erikson. In Childhood and Society (1950), Erikson emphasises the crucial
role in human development of what he called basic trust. Erikson’s work
has influenced also some sociological writings16 – but not remarkably those
of Luhmann. The best-known sociologist who has used Erikson’s concept
of basic trust as a theoretical tool is Anthony Giddens. He emphasises that
this type of basic trust can be grasped as one of elements that make up the
origins of a person’s ontological security (see Giddens 1990). Erikson
believed that babies developing normally in normal circumstances do so
because they have a certain elementary or primitive trust in their parents,
especially in the mother. The salient factor in the development of trust
based on infantile experience was, for Erikson, the quality of the maternal
relationship.
The first demonstration of social trust in the baby is the ease of his feeding,
the depth of his sleep,and the relaxation of his bowels…The infant’s first
social achievement…is his willingness to let the mother out of sight without
undue anxiety or rage, because she has become an inner certainty as well as
an outer predictability. Such consistency, continuity, and sameness of
experience provide a rudimentary sense of ego identity which depends, I
think, on the recognition that there is an inner population of remembered
and anticipated sensations and images which are firmly correlated with the
outer population of familiar and predictable things and people. (Erikson
1950, 219)
The work of Erikson thus provides a major source of insights into the
significance of trust in the context of early childhood development. Basic
trust can be conceived of as a starting point for all forms of trust thereafter.
The absence of basic trust can be seen in infantile schizophrenia, while its
lack is also apparent in some severely disturbed adult personalities.
However, Erikson’s concern was not with trust as such but with patterns of
normal and abnormal human development. “He did not really try to define
trust but seems to have thought of it as a kind of confidence in regularities”
16
Talcott Parsons was also familiar with Erikson’s theories. Erikson’s influence is evident
in Parsons’ and Bales’ Family, Socialization and Interaction Process (1956) as well as in
Social Structure and Personality (1964). Despite this, however, there does not seem to be
very much common in Erikson’s and Parsons’ concepts of trust.

45

<-----Page 59----->(Govier 1997, 10). Despite this, Erikson (1950, 220) prefers the word ‘trust’
because there is more naïveté and more mutuality to it. Moreover, as
Giddens (1990, 94) cites Erikson, trust implies not only “that one has
learned to rely on the sameness and continuity of the outer providers” but
also “that one may trust oneself”.
However, it cannot be said that Luhmann did not follow Erikson’s theory of
trust at all. There can be found some points of convergence between
Erikson and Luhmann when the latter considers the process of learning
trust. Luhmann emphasises that the learning process is mediated by the
experiences of the learner by himself and is controlled by the selfdeveloping (also learned) identity of the learner. Despite the fact that
Luhmann takes social psychological accounts of trust with a grain of salt,
he connects the learning process of trust with early childhood. Although he
does not quote Erikson directly, the following citation from Vertrauen
proves that Luhmann has absorbed Erikson’s idea of basic trust.
If the child establishes his own self differentiating ‘I’ and ‘You’, the first
thing he has to do is forget his first, practically unmotivated, act of trust and
find a form of trust which takes account of this differentiation. The learning
process will not force the separation of I and You into complete and
absolute distinction. On the contrary, the You stays as ‘another I’. The
learner reasons from himself to others and is thus in the position to
generalize from his experiences with others. Because he feels he is prepared
to honour the trust of some unknown person, he is also able to show trust to
others. (Luhmann 1979, 28.)
There are, of course, several other psychological studies of trust. But in
contrast to Erikson, these studies (for example Rotter 1967; 1980; Pearce
1974 ) have not had a remarkable influence in sociology. Nonetheless, one
considerable work on trust in the context of psychology, which should be
mentioned here because it has been the subject of Luhmann’s critique, has
been linked to the Prisoner’s Dilemma games. Work on trust in this area
was pioneered by Morton Deutsch. The term ‘trust’ was given simple
behavioural interpretations in these studies. Trust was operationally defined
as “making a co-operative choice in the game” (Deutsch 1960). If players
46

<-----Page 60----->who do not know that their co-player will choose co-operatively,
nevertheless choose co-operatively themselves, they are regarded to have
made a trusting choice. The players do not know each other and do not
necessarily communicate. According to Deutsch (1962, 303), “a trusting
choice may be based upon ‘despair’, ‘conformity’, ‘impulsivity’,
‘innocence’, ‘virtue’, ‘faith’, ‘masochism’, or ‘confidence’, although the
notion of such multiplicity is rather unsophisticated.”
Luhmann was very critical of the psychological approach to trust. He says
that social psychology – referring particularly to Deutsch – in fact
constantly attempts to reduce the social sphere (communication) to
individual psychological variables (consciousness), which is why it is in no
position to account for these facts very clearly. Therefore, “one of the first
lessons of a theory of social systems is that very different personality
systems can be functionally equivalent in social systems, so that social
systems may to a certain extent be free form the personality processes of
individuals” (Luhmann 1979, 9). Furthermore, Luhmann (1979, 30) was
convinced that psychology made no distinction either between familiarity
and trust, or between trust and confidence.
Despite his critique against Deutsch, I would like to note that in Vertrauen
there can be found some sentences, in where Luhmann seems to move at
the same level of discussion with the Prisoner’s Dilemma games. That is,
Luhmann says that trust is always contingent and it is only possible in a
situation where the possible damage may be greater than the advantage you
seek. Luhmann (1979, 24) illustrates the characteristics of this type of
decision in a following way:
If a mother leaves a child in the care of a babysitter, a number of hopes are
associated with this: that nothing untoward will happen, that the girl will be
kind to the baby, will not disturb its sleep by turning up the radio, and so
on. Her trust only extends to eventualities which, if they occur, would cause
her to regret her decision to go out at all and to leave her child in the care of
anybody. Trust therefore always bears upon a critical alternative, in which
the harm resulting from a breach of trust may be greater than the benefit to
47

<-----Page 61----->be gained from the trust proving warranted. Hence one who trusts takes
cognizanze of the possibility of excessive harm arising from the selectivity
of others’ actions and adopts a position towards that possibility.
What, then, can be said about the philosophical account on trust and its role
in the development of Luhmann’s conception of the topic? From
Luhmann’s most important work on trust, Vertrauen (1968), one can find
but a few philosophical citations relating directly to the topic. The major
explanation for this is the fact that most normative or moral philosophers
have not written extensively about trust. The classical ethicists – Plato’s
Socrates, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, Kant and Smith –
hardly mention the term except occasionally as an aside or observation. As
noted before, trust or at least its perception is indeed very modern. It is
surely articulated in early modern political theory, both by proponents of
modern natural law (Grotius, Puffendord, Locke) and by its detractors
(Hume, Smith) (Seligman 1997, 31). The Encyclopedia of Ethics (1992)
devotes less than 2 of its 600 pages to a discussion of trust, and cites only
minor passages from Aristotle and Locke. There has thus been an almost
complete silence on the subject of trust in the tradition of moral philosophy.
Annette Baier – who has published several influential papers on trust
combining Luhmann’s view with those of classical philosophers17 – is well17
According to Baier’s (1986) general account, trust may be conscious or unconscious,
wanted or unwanted, directed at an unspecified group of others or at some particular other.
When one trusts, he depends on another’s good will and is necessarily vulnerable to the
limits of good will. Trust is thus accepted vulnerability to another’s possible but not
expected ill will toward one. However, a slight oddity in Baier’s account is her belief that
we trust others not to engage in or refrain from various actions but to care for various
things. But this difference with regard to Luhmann’s theory is smaller than it appears
because Baier understands ‘things’ to include such abstractions as one’s own health and
life. On this model, trusting is a three-place relation: A trusts B with valued thing C.
There are several interests Baier has in common with Luhmann. She discovered
Luhmann’s analysis in preparing the article Trust and Antitrust (1986) and in many ways
agreed with it. First important Luhmannian finding by Baier was the importance of tact in
building trust relationships. Luhmann treats personal trust as a risky investment and looks
at mechanisms for initiating and maintaining trust. Baier (1986, 238-239) stresses that “tact
is said to play an important role in both. It enables trust-offering overtures to be rejected
without hostility ensuing, and it enables those who make false moves in their attempts to
maintain trust to recover their position without too much loss of face.” Baier thus seems to
agree with Luhmann (1979, 84) who says that: “a social climate…institutionalizes tact and
knows enough escape routes for self-presentation in difficult situations”. Baier (1986, 239)
regards (on the basis of Luhmann’s work) tact as a virtue which needs to be added to the

48

<-----Page 62----->known for addressing the ‘silence’ on trust in the tradition of moral
philosophy and truly wonders at it. “Moral philosophers have always been
interested in cooperation between people, and so it is surprising that they
have not said more than they have about trust” (Baier 1986, 232).18 Baier
recovers only few forms of trust to which the great philosophers have paid
explicit attention.
Saint Thomas Aquinas, and other Christian moralists, have extolled the
virtue of faith and, more relevantly, of hope, and so have said something
about trust in God. And in the modern period some of the great moral and
political philosophers, in particular John Locke, looked at trust in
governments and officials, and some have shown what might be called an
obsessive trust in contracts and contractors, even if not, after Hobbes's good
example here, an equal obsession with the grounds for such trust. (Baier
1986, 233.)
Western moral philosophy, until recently, has been almost exclusively
theoretical, with few applied concepts. Trust, consequently, was pushed to
the background of normative ethics; it remained a result of proper actions,
not a part of proper actions. (Hosmer 1995, 394-395.) I would say that this
is also one reason why Luhmann did not find classical philosophers
important in his research on trust. For Luhmann, as I have shown, trust is
not a result of proper action but a decision (to communicate in a way)
which will reduce complexity. Furthermore, (at least the ‘later’) Luhmann
was quite sceptically disposed towards the connections between sociology,
delicacy of discrimination in recognising what one is trusted with, good judgement in
deciding who to trust with what, and a willingness to admit and forgive fault, which is
something all functional virtues needed in those who would sustain trust.
Second, the idea that confidence pairs with danger and institutions and trust with risk and
people is originally constructed by Luhmann. Although Baier does not fundamentally
follow Luhmann, she by and large agrees with this division. Baier does not draw so sharp a
distinction between danger and risk, or between confidence in institutions and trust in
people. She thinks that there is a continuum between our most and our least chosen
vulnerabilities to others, so that Luhmann’s ‘danger’ and ‘risk’ will merge. Nor does she
think that all our trusting and risk taking is directed towards individuals. From her point of
view, we place our trust also in procedures. (Baier 1992, 150.)
18
Baier claims that the religious ‘stamp’ on trust might be one reason why moral
philosophy left the topic in the margin. “Religious traditions are places where we find it
preached that trust in God, and in religious superiors who claim to speak on God’s behalf,
are virtues. It is not so surprising that philosophers have tended to shy clear of talking
much about trust, given its guilt by association with such suspect monkish virtues as
obedience” (Baier 1992, 143).

49

<-----Page 63----->moral and ethics. Sociology cannot be ethics and ethics cannot be
sociology. This clearly is another reason why Luhmann does not examine
trust in the context of normative and moral philosophy.
A sociology of the moral will never become an ethical theory. It will never
be able to claim for itself a moral quality, be it good or bad, be it nice and
helpful or cynical. Moralists may feel free to evaluate sociological theories
and sociologists may feel free to respond in moral terms; but sociologists, at
least, should avoid mixing up roles, codes, systems. (Luhmann 1996, 32.)
Although the concept has not been used directly, the interest in establishing
nonascriptive bases for trust has been evidently a permanent theme in John
Locke’s concern with “trustworthiness, fidelity, the keeping of agreements
and promises and respect for oaths as a precondition for the existence of
society, through the writings of Adam Smith on ‘natural sympathy’, and
Edmund Burke’s writings on the ‘little platoons’ of society” (Seligman
1997, 15-16.) Besides, according to Gerald Mara (2001), variations of the
concept of trust, particularly political trust, have been a central subject of
philosophical inquiry since classical political philosophy. Thucydides’
representation of the debate over the city of Mytilene in the War Between
the Peleponnessians and the Athenians and Plato’s dialogue Protagoras are
good examples of the classic philosophy of trust. These texts consider the
question of why particular forms of trust are good for political
communities, particularly those guided by democratic deliberation.
The silence on trust may become more understandable when we consider
the goals of Western moral philosophy. Despite the lack of explicit
attention on trust, it is self-evident that some idea of trust in moral
philosophy has to be included in the principles of ‘good society’. According
to Larue Hosmer (1995, 394), the goal of moral philosophy “has been to
find the ‘first principle’, or the ideal rule upon which all other rules could
be based, that would lead to a ‘good’ society”. A ‘good’ society has been
defined as one in which the members willingly cooperate for the ultimate
benefit of all (see Rawls, 1967).
50

<-----Page 64----->Furthermore, I would argue that the philosophical concern with trust has
largely been bound to promise-keeping, which itself is an important element
of ‘good societies’. In the early modern period the concern with promisekeeping actualised in establishing social bonds of trust in a society
increasingly defined by individual agents with interests and commitments
of an increasingly personal nature. However, the breakdown of local,
territorial and primordial ties that accompanied Europe’s entry into the
modern era engendered a new concern with redefining the nature of society.
In this type of society, where the promise is an act of will that invites trust
among strangers (among those who share no ties of affinity, kinship, or
even shared belief), new forms of generalised trust had to be established.
Generalised trust came to fruition, as has been attested by many scholars
(see Baier 1985, 174; Cupit 1994), as “a speech act whereby one alters the
moral situation” by incurring new obligations. “The social ties predicated
on these obligations and the moral force of one’s commitment to them thus
serve as forging a new model of the political community – one based on
shared belief in the very act of promise keeping” (Seligman 1997, 15).

Current Influence
Luhmann’s seemingly marginal and idiosyncratic concerns with trust in the
early seventies have turned into a rich intellectual enterprise with a large
and constantly growing number of contributions. Most sociological writings
on trust follow the division put forward by Luhmann: trust is connected to
persons, on the one hand, and to abstract systems, on the other.
First, trust has been linked to personal relations. There is an emerging
recognition of “the necessity for and the ubiquity of trust in human relations
and the impossibility of building continuing social relations without some
element of trust and common meaning” (Eisenstadt and Roniger 1984, 1617). Sociologists have finally discovered “the clear and simple fact that,
without trust, the everyday social life which we take for granted is simply
not possible” (Good 1988, 32). Most would now agree that “the existence
51

<-----Page 65----->of trust is an essential component of all enduring social relationships”
(Seligman 1997, 13; Sztompka 1999, ix).
Second, trust has been also connected to ‘abstract systems’ and
organisations or institutions. It is seen as an “integrative mechanism that
creates and sustains solidarity in social relationships and systems” (Barber
1983, 21). Or, as Anthony Giddens (1991, 120) puts it: “With the
development of abstract systems, trust in impersonal principles, as well as
in anonymous others, becomes indispensable to social existence.” This
means, that “trust in abstract systems provides for the security of day-to-day
reliability, but by its very nature cannot supply either the mutuality or
intimacy which personal trust relations offer” (Giddens 1990, 114).
Trusting organisations or institutions also means something different from
trusting another person. “It means knowing and recognizing as valid the
values and form of life incorporated in an institution and deriving from this
recognition the assumption that this idea makes sufficient sense to a
sufficient number of people to motivate their ongoing active support for the
institution and the compliance with its rules” (Offe 1999, 70).
The growing interest in the concept of trust can be linked to the societal
change which, in turn, is characterised by social differentiation,
contingency, growing complexity, risks etc. In the traditional world where
risks were natural – compared to the contingent risks of the modern world –
control and socialisation were enough to guarantee the stability of the social
reality. As Talcott Parsons stated, both norms and the familiar form of trust
(which is based on the membership of societal collectivity and norms) were
enough to guarantee integration as well as continuity of systems. In the
traditional world trust was grasped as an attitude, based on beliefs and
feelings and implying expectations and dispositions. For example, when
one trusted a friend, he believed that the other is likely to act kindly and
benevolently toward him, that the other is unlikely to harm him, that the
other is well-disposed toward him. To trust a friend was to regard him as a
person of integrity, one who is loyal and caring. In Parsonsian language, to
52

<-----Page 66----->trust a friend was to regard him as a familiar person, or at least a person
whose orientations towards us was keenly bound to norms by societal
collectivity. Trusting in the traditional world thus concretised itself in the
familiar world controlled and socialised by societal collectivity.
As said above, in contemporary sociology of trust (see for example
Gambetta 1988; Giddens 1990; 1991; Misztal 1996; Earle and Cvetkovich
1995; Govier 1997; Sztompka 1999) – which has been greatly influenced
by Luhmann – the concept has been particularly understood to be connected
with risks and uncertainty. In other words, trusting becomes the crucial
strategy for dealing with an uncertain and uncontrollable future. Trust thus
understood is “a simplifying strategy that enables individuals to adapt to
complex social environment, and thereby benefit from increased
opportunities” (Earle and Cvetkovich 1995, 38). Or, as Diego Gambetta
(1988, 218) notes: “Trust is particularly relevant in conditions of ignorance
or uncertainty with respect to unknown or unknowable actions of others”.
Furthermore, as Trudy Govier (1997, 4) says: “Trusting another, we are
willing to go ahead without a guarantee. We feel that we can rely or depend
on the other, even though there is always some possibility that he or she
will act in unexpected ways, or even betray us.” Therefore, though the word
‘trust’ has a kind of warm and positive tone, it is not entirely a matter of
familiarity, feeling and emotion (as it was in the traditional world). Trust
presupposes beliefs, and often those beliefs are based on evidence. Trust in
other people is made possible by our inductively extended beliefs, our
responses to others, our sense of ourselves, our position in the world, and
our values. Trust is “possible because we are not only knowing and
believing creatures but valuing creatures who relate in a profound and
profoundly natural way to others” (Govier 1997, 9). The risky and
ambivalent character of social life appears to make the task of addressing
the problem of trust and social control more pressing than ever. In general,
following Luhmann, we need trust and confidence because norms, values
and familiarity alone are not enough to solve the problems of today’s risk
society.
53

<-----Page 67----->The most functionalist (and thus most Luhmannian) contributions to the
current sociological debate on trust are, perhaps, those by Anthony Giddens
and Piotr Sztompka. It should be noted here that although influenced by
Luhmann, these approaches do not examine the concept of trust in the
context of advanced systems theory. They have appropriated some ideas of
Luhmann but do not grasp trust – in the way that I do – as a systemstheoretically oriented communicative decision aimed at reducing the
complexity of society.
Like Luhmann, Giddens and Sztompka also use the concept of trust in
reference to something that has to do with risks. As with Luhmann, trust is
required in the modern world because we know so little about the systems
with which we have to deal. Giddens (1991, 244) defines trust as “the
vesting of confidence in persons or in abstract systems, made on the basis
of a ‘leap of faith’ which brackets ignorance or lack of information”.
Sztompka’s concepts of trust and confidence seem to be quite near to those
of Luhmann. “In situations when we have to act in spite of uncertainty and
risk, the third orientation (in addition to hope and confidence) comes to the
fore, that of trust. Trusting becomes the crucial strategy for dealing with an
uncertain and uncontrollable future”. (Sztompka 1999, 25.)

Giddens: Trust as a Commitment
The starting point for Giddens’ (1984; 1990; 1991; Beck et al.1994) theory
of trust comes from the (late) modernisation of society and the problems
around it. Although modernisation of institutions and globalisation have
enhanced individuals’ possibilities for achieving a safe life, these
phenomena have also had a flipside. Following Giddens, the discussion on
trust has to do with the fact that individuals’ everyday life has become more
complex and risks have increased. In addition to risks, this discussion has
also a clear connection to contingency and the changed relation between
time and space. It is also acknowledged that most risks affect us all.
54

<-----Page 68----->Trust is related to absence in time and in space. There would be no need to
trust anyone whose thought processes were transparent, or to trust any
system whose workings were wholly known and understood…Trust is
basically bound up, not with risk, but with contingency. Trust always
carries the connotation of reliability in the face of contingent outcomes,
whether these concern on the actions of individuals or the operation of
systems…Risk and trust intertwine. Risk is not just a matter of individual
action. There are ‘environments of risk’ that collectively affect large masses
of individuals. (Giddens 1990, 33-35)
Giddens acknowledges the importance of Luhmann’s views on trust. He
also examines the differences between trust and confidence as well as
between risk and danger. Giddens follows in Luhmann’s footsteps by
distinguishing trust in people and trust in abstract systems. Trust in persons
“is built upon mutuality of response and involvement: faith in the integrity
of another is a prime source of feeling of integrity and authenticity of the
self. Trust in abstract systems provides for the security of day-to-day
reliability, but by its very nature cannot supply either the mutuality or
intimacy which personal trust relations offer”. (Giddens 1990, 144.) He
admits that these concepts have differences, but in spite of that, are bound
up with one another. Whereas Luhmann sees trust as bound to exact
situations, according to Giddens it is continual. This continuity derives, in
Giddens’ view, from the multiplication of risks, contingency and the
changed relations between time and space.
Luhmann’s approach is important and directs our attention to a number of
conceptual discriminations that have to be made in understanding trust. Yet
I do not think we can be content with the details of his conceptualisation.
He is surely right to distinguish between trust and confidence, and between
risk and danger, as well as to say that all of these are in some way closely
bound up with one another. But it is unhelpful to connect the notion of trust
to the specific circumstances in which individuals consciously contemplate
alternative courses of action. Trust is usually much more of a continuous
state than this implies. It is, I shall suggest, a particular type of confidence
rather than distinct from it. (Giddens 1990, 32.)
Giddens does not separate trust and confidence as radically as Luhmann. To
him trust is a particular type of confidence or part of confidence rather than
55

<-----Page 69----->something distinct from it. Similar observations apply to risk and danger.
According to Giddens (1990, 32; 34), “danger exists in circumstances of
risk and is actually relevant to defining what risk is… What risk presumes
is precisely danger.” For Luhmann, the distinction between risk and danger
presupposes that uncertainty exists in relation to future loss. In the case of
risk, the potential loss is “regarded as a consequence of the decision, that is
to say, it is attributed to the decision” (Luhmann 1993, 21-22). In the case
of danger, “the possible loss is considered to have been caused externally,
that is to say, it is attributed to the environment” (Luhmann 1993, 22).
Furthermore, an analysis of decision making and affected involvement
shows, that “the risks are attributed to decisions made, whereas dangers are
attributed externally. The risks the decision maker takes and has to take
become a danger for those affected.” (Luhmann 1993, 107.) This means,
that risks have been turned into dangers by some decision-makers (for
example politicians). Nevertheless, Giddens comes up with a similar
division between trust and confidence as Luhmann when he describes the
disembedding and re-embedding of the modern world.19 According to
Giddens (1990, 80), there are two kinds of commitments in the modern
world, which also have strong connection with the need and development of
trust: facework commitments and faceless commitments.
Facework commitments bind up the relationships, which are maintained
and expressed by attendance. These commitments are based on the
trustworthiness of the other and concern only those who know one another
and are, therefore, better in touch with each other as well as with the whole
society. “Trust in persons involves facework commitments, in which
indicators of the integrity of others (within given arenas of action) are
19

Disembedding and re-embedding must be understood in the context of individualisation.
Individualisation means, first, the disembedding and, second, the re-embedding of
industrial society’s ways of life by new ones, in which the individuals must produce, stage
and cobble together their biographies themselves. Disembedding and re-embedding do not
occur by chance, nor individually, nor voluntarily, nor through diverse types of historical
conditions, but rather (all at once and) under the general conditions of the welfare state in
developed industrial labour society, as they have developed since the 1960s in many
Western industrial countries. (Giddens 1994, 13.)

56

<-----Page 70----->sought” (Giddens 1990, 88). In traditional societies trust was based on the
familiarity of the local community and the continuous presence of others. In
modern societies, too, the facework commitments are a firm part of
personal trust. As Giddens (1990, 121) notes, these relationships are ties
based upon trust where trust is not pre-given but worked upon, and where
the work involved means a mutual process of self-disclosure. Giddens calls
this type of relationships pure relationships, which can be viewed as
prototypical of the new spheres of personal life. They are key environments
for building the reflexive project of the self, since they both allow for and
demand organised and continuous self-understanding – the means of
securing a durable tie to the other (Giddens 1991, 186).
A pure relationship is one in which external criteria have become dissolved:
the relationship exists solely for whatever rewards that relationship as such
can deliver. In the context of the pure relationship, trust can be mobilised
only by a process of mutual disclosure. Trust, in other words, can by
definition no longer be anchored in criteria outside the realitionship itself –
such as criteria of kinship, social duty or traditional obligation…Pure
relationships presuppose ‘commitment’, which is a particular species of
trust. Commitment in turn has to be understood as a phenomenon of the
internally referential system: it is a commitment to the relationship as such ,
as well as to the other person or persons involved. (Giddens 1991, 6.)
Faceless commitments are a product of modernity. The core of these
commitments are expert systems and new symbolic tokens. “It will be a
basic part of my argument that the nature of modern institutions is deeply
bound up with the mechanisms of trust in abstract systems, especially trust
in expert systems” (Giddens 1990, 83). Following Beck, Giddens (1990;
1991; Beck et al.1994) argues that the character of the modern is oriented
by the future. The character of risks has changed; experts do not only
foretell the future, but they create it. Also, because the character of
expertise is global, no one can get out of its clutches. Therefore, it can be
concluded that we are dependent on faceless commitments. We must have
confidence in them because we cannot get rid of them. They oblige us to act
in a certain way. Or, as Giddens (1990, 88) puts it: “Trust in systems takes

57

<-----Page 71----->the form of faceless commitments, in which faith is sustained in the
workings of knowledge of which the lay person is largely ignorant.”
Although Giddens notes that in modern society confidence might be more
important than personal trust, he does not completely reject the connections
between them. Why then, do we have confidence in expert systems,
although we cannot know all of their functions? Giddens (1990, 89)
answers that it is ignorance which is behind the need of confidence. But
ignorance has also its own Janus face. Ignorance always creates grounds for
scepticism, or at least caution towards the experts. Popular representations
of science and technical expertise typically bracket respect with attitudes of
hostility or fear, as in the stereotypes of the ‘boffin’, a humourless
technician with little understanding of ordinary people, or the mad scientist.
The most problematic spheres of confidence are the situations where the
ignorant person encounters the expertise system. These are starting points
of growing confidence or sceptical attitude against systems. Giddens (1990,
83) calls these situations access points. Following Giddens, I would say that
it is exactly in these situations where the trust relationship between persons
and the system is actualised. Access points have a lot of potential but they
are also dangerous and open to misconceptions.
Attitudes of trust, or lack of trust, toward specific abstract systems are liable
to be strongly influenced by experiences at access points…The fact that
access points are places of tension between lay scepticism and professional
expertise makes them acknowledged sources of vulnerability for abstract
systems. (Giddens 1990, 90-91.)
The functionality of the access point can be outlined with an example of the
relationship between doctor and patient. When the patient goes to the
doctor, is he quite often ignorant of the disease he has. The doctor
represents the expert system, in which the patient has confidence. When the
doctor and the patient encounter one another, the doctor can, with his
presence, either strengthen the patient’s confidence in the system or
alternatively awake suspicions about his own abilities. Good treatment
58

<-----Page 72----->often strengthens the patient’s confidence, but bad treatment strengthens
only mistrust and suspicions.20
In addition to trust and confidence, Giddens (1984; 1990) examines also the
concept called basic trust. It deals with a person’s ontological security and
is more emotional than a cognitive phenomenon. As stated above, the
theoretical background of this concept lies in the social psychological
examinations by Erik Erikson. Erikson examined the behaviour of children.
According to Erikson, the first real social achievement of a child is being
able to let go of the mother without the feelings of rage or fear. This
happens because the child has achieved a certain amount of inner certainty
about the external conditions. The child trusts other persons and feels
himself trustworthy as well. (Erikson 1950, 219-221; Giddens 1984, 53.)
With the assistance of basic trust, ontological security and trust in everyday
life also grows.
The ontological security refers to the confidence that most human beings
have in the continuity of their self-identity and in the constancy of the
surrounding social and material environments of action. A sense of the
reliability of persons and things, so central to the notion of trust, is basic to
feelings of ontological security; hence the two are psychologically related.
(Giddens 1990, 92.)
Giddens emphasises that the importance of trust, ontological security and
continuity do not decrease when the human being grows. Rather, to the
contrary, it is nearly impossible to think about meeting the everyday
routines without basic trust. Without basic trust, the outcome “is persistent
existential anxiety. In its most profound sense, the antithesis of trust is thus
a state of mind which could best be summed up as existential angst of
dread.” (Giddens 1990, 100.) Basic trust is connected also to pure
20

Although Giddens does not cite Parsons, the access points seem to be almost
synonymous for Parsons’ concept of competence gap. They both refer to situations in
where layman meets the expert. Because the patient does not fully understand what the
nature of his disease is, he needs the doctor’s expertise. By going to the doctor, the patient
shows his confidence in the system. In order for confidence to exist in these relations,
persons must have common values and common goals. Here the goal is good treatment.
Unlike Giddens, Parsons does not examine the negative side of this type of relations.

59

<-----Page 73----->relationships. This is because pure relationships offer the opportunity for
the development of trust based on voluntary commitments and an
intensified intimacy. “Where achieved and relatively secure, such trust is
psychologically stabilising, because of the strong connections between
basic trust and the reliability of caretaking figures” (Giddens 1991, 186).
Following Giddens, some type of basic trust thus has an effect beyond trust
in persons as well as trust in abstract systems. Giddens (1991, 3) sums up
his theory of trust in the following way:
In circumstances of uncertainty and multiple choice, the notions of trust and
risk have particular application. Trust, I argue, is a crucial generic
phenomenon of personality development as well as having distinctive and
specific relevance to a world of disembedding mechanisms and abstract
systems. In its generic manifestations, trust is directly linked to achieving
an early sense of ontological security. Trust established between an infant
and its caretakers provides an ‘inoculation’ which screens off potential
threats and dangers that even the most mundane activites of day-to-day life
contain. Trust in this sense is basic to a ‘protective cocoon’ which stand
guard over the self in its dealings with everyday reality. It ‘brackets out’
potential occurrences which, we the individual seriously to contemplate
them, would produce a paralysis of the will, or feelings of engulfment. In
it’s a more specific guise, trust is a medium of interaction with the abstract
systems which both empty day-to-day life of its traditional content and set
up globalising influences. Trust here generates that ‘leap into faith’which
practical engagement demands.

Sztompka: Trust as a ‘Bet’
Piotr Sztompka’s Trust: A Sociological Theory (1999) is a very ambitious
work. It tries to disentangle the problematics of trust and apply the concept
to the study of contemporary society. More specifically, it attempts to take
stock of the evolving investigations of trust, particularly those with
theoretical implications, and to explicate, clarify, systematise, but also to
elaborate and synthesise their findings. As Sztompka (1999, x) himself
phrases it:
My main ambition is theoretical: to provide conceptual and typological
clarifications and explications of the notion of trust, and then to propose an
explanatory model of the emergence (or decay) of trust cultures. In due
60

<-----Page 74----->course I shall also deal with the foundations and justifications of trust,
functions and dysfunctions of trust, and the functional substitutes for trust.
Being theoretically attuned, Sztompka has appropriated many of
Luhmann’s ideas. I will concentrate here on Sztompka’s definition of trust
and his analyses of the functions of trust. Sztompka begins by theorising
connections between risk and trust. Trust is, in Sztompka’s view, intimately
related to risk. Following Luhmann’s (1988, 95) statement, “trust is a
solution for specific problems of risk”; Sztompka (1999, 25) specifies the
meaning of trust with one sentence: “Trust is a bet about the future
contingent actions of others.” This means that by acting in uncertain and
uncontrollable conditions, we take risks, we gamble, we make bets about
the future, uncertain, free actions of others. Trust as a ‘bet’ is a type of
orientation with which we may face the human predicament of the
uncertain and risky future. Other orientations are hope and confidence. The
first is “a passive, vague, not rationally justified feeling that things will turn
out to good (or to the bad)” (Sztompka 1999, 24). “I hope to be happily
married someday” would be an example of a statement expressing hope.
The latter “is still passive, but more focused and to some extent justified,
faith that something good will happen (or not)” (Sztompka 1999, 24). For
example, “reading reports of politics, I am confident that the future of the
welfare state is stable” (Sztompka 1999, 24) is a statement expressing
confidence.
Furthermore, it should be noted here that Sztompka’s definition of risk is
very close to that of Luhmann’s. Like Luhmann, Sztompka also views risk
as “oriented toward future” and asserts that “one can never be certain of the
outcomes that making the bet [Luhmann might say the decision] of trust
will bring. Risk is always present”. (Sztompka 1999, 30.) Dangers, in turn,
“are passively awaited and at most hoped to be averted or avoided”
(Sztompka 1999, 30). For Sztompka, the notion of ‘risk’ is central to
modern culture. He admits that “this relates to the growing significance of
trust, as means of taming risks and countering uncertainties. The link was
already perceived by Luhmann.” (Sztompka 1999, 40.)
61

<-----Page 75----->According to Sztompka, the functions of trust occur in three different
levels: personal, communal and systemic. First, at the personal level,
endowing others with trust evokes positive actions toward those others.
Trust liberates and mobilises human agency, releases creative, uninhibited,
innovative, entrepreneurial activism toward other people. Sztompka (1999,
103) notes that “the uncertainty and risk surrounding their actions is
lowered”, and hence – he cites Luhmann (1979, 40) – “possibilities of
action increase proportionally to the increase in trust”. Interactions with
those who we endow with trust are liberated from anxiety, suspicion, and
watchfulness, and allow for more spontaneity and openness. We are
released from the necessity of monitoring and controlling every move made
by others, of constantly ‘looking at their hands’. (Sztompka 1999, 103.) The
positive consequences of trust do not influence only the givers of trust, but
the recipients as well. It is important to trust, but it may be equally
important to be trusted. Or, as Sztompka (1999, 104) says: “Being visibly
trusted by some may be an argument for others to grant trust too. Thus
receiving trust raises one’s trustworthiness in other transactions.”
Second, in Sztompka’s analyses trust has an important function, not only
for partners but also for wider communities (groups, associations,
organisations, etc.) within which it prevails. Trust encourages sociability,
participation with others in various forms of associations, and in this way
enriches the network of interpersonal ties, enlarges the field of interactions,
and allows for greater intimacy of interpersonal contacts. In other words,
Sztompka (1999, 105) says that trust “increases what Durkheim called the
‘moral density’, and what modern authors describe as ‘social capital’ (see
also Putnam 1995), or ‘spontaneous sociability’ (see Fukuyama 1995, 2729)”. Trust favours also the spread of communication and improves
spontaneous collective action.21

62

<-----Page 76----->Furthermore, trust encourages tolerance, acceptance of strangers, and
recognition of cultural or political differences as legitimate – because it
allows them to be perceived in a non-threatening manner. In this way trust
bridles expressions of inter-group hostility and xenophobia, and civilises
disputes. The culture of trust strengthens the bond an individual has with
the community, contributes to feelings of identity, and generates strong
collective solidarities leading to cooperation, reciprocal help, and even the
readiness for sacrifice on behalf of others. (Sztompka 1999, 105.) When the
culture of trust is present, transaction costs are significantly lowered and
chances for cooperation increased. Sztompka (1999, 105) ends his analyses
of communal functions of trust in Luhmann’s (1979, 8) statement: “When
there is trust there are increased possibilities for experience and action”.
Third, Sztompka’s functional analyses of trust also extend to the systemic
level. This is because he attempts to move the discussion towards more
complex ‘systems of trust’ and look into the functions or dysfunctions of
combined networks of such relationships. Sztompka (1999, 110) again cites
Luhmann (1979, 88), who emphasises that “without trust only very simple
forms of human cooperation which can be transacted on the spot are
possible…Trust is indispensable in order to increase a social system’s
potential for action beyond these elementary forms.” However, although
Sztompka admits that there is a need for some type of systemic trust, he
does not view social systems as communicatively coded subsystems – like
‘early’ Luhmann did in his systems theory – but rather as networks, which
are functioning within the culture of trust, wherein “the routine of trusting
and meeting trust turns into normative rule for both the trusters and the
trustees” (Sztompka 1999, 111). These cultural ‘systems of trust’ or
networks must then “include strong norms with positive sanctions,
motivating trustworthiness, and strong taboos with negative sanctions
prohibiting breaches of trust” (Sztompka 1999, 111-112).

21

It should be noted here that although Sztompka mentions the importance of
communication, he does not say anything about Luhmann’s advanced concept of

63

<-----Page 77----->Finally, Sztompka (1999, 115) comes to the conclusion that trust “has
generally beneficial consequences for the partners in social relationships,
and the groups to which they belong, as well as for the peaceful,
harmonious, and cohesive quality of wider social life.” Trust thus seems to
be an all-encompassing concept, which automatically makes life more safe
and unproblematic at the personal, communal and even systemic levels. I
would even say that in the final analysis, Sztompka seems to forget the
connection between trust and risk, and no longer characterises trust as a
‘bet’ on the future contingent actions of others.

From Parsons to Sztompka
In this chapter I have analysed Parsons’ and Simmel’s concepts of trust
which have had an important influence on Luhmann’s research on the topic.
I have also considered the reason why some well-known psychological and
philosophical accounts of trust did not play an explicit role in Luhmann’s
trust research. Furthermore, I have also examined Giddens’ and Sztompka’s
concepts of trust which, in turn, have been largely affected by Luhmann.
Parsons grasped trust as a feeling and a parallel concept to familiarity.
Norms and values, which are created by societal community, define the
limits of trust. Therefore, it is not rational to trust strangers or any persons
who do not belong to the same societal community. Simmel, for his part,
grasped trust as a force that works for and through individuals. He attributes
a high moral value to trust, which makes it a rather special medium of
social exchange. Besides, he noted that trust, or confidence, is also a force
that works for and through human association more generally. It is a moral
or institutional force which assists in the development of confidential
reciprocal relationships, or trust.

communication, or its connections with the function of trust.

64

<-----Page 78----->Luhmann appropriated many ideas from Parsons and some from Simmel’s
writings on trust into his own research on the topic. The boundaries of
system, its particular form and the family’s socialising role were important
milestones in Parsons’ as well as Luhmann’s conceptions on trust.
Although in Vertrauen Luhmann uses only four brief citations from
Simmel, there are some apparent connections between them. Both of them
coupled trust with the problem of knowledge and ‘non-knowledge’; how to
renew trust was an important question for Simmel as well as for Luhmann;
and finally, Simmel’s theory of the stranger also influenced Luhmann.
The psychological and philosophical accounts of trust have had hardly any
influence on the development of Luhmann’s theory of trust. If anything,
Luhmann was critical of the psychological approach to trust. He notes that
especially social psychology constantly attempts to reduce the social sphere
to individual psychological variables, which is why it is in no position to
account for these facts very clearly. Luhmann does not give very much
attention to normative and moral philosophy because only a few classic
philosophers have written extensively on trust. Luhmann was also disposed
sceptically towards the connections between sociology, moral and ethics.
Therefore, according to Luhmann, the normative and moral philosophical
writings about trust did not fit well into an analysis of the sociological
concept of trust. Furthermore, in Western moral philosophy, trust was
mainly pushed to the background of normative ethics; it remained a result
of proper actions.
Like Luhmann, Giddens and Sztompka also emphasise that trust has
something to do with risks. Giddens – following Luhmann – distinguishes
trust in people and confidence in abstract systems. In his theory trust is
connected to facework and faceless commitments. Trust in persons involves
facework commitments and Giddens calls this type of relationships pure
relationships. In modern world we are also dependent on faceless
commitments, which oblige us to act in a certain way. These commitments,
in turn, strengthen confidence in abstract systems. Giddens also lays
65

<-----Page 79----->emphasis on the role of basic trust, which can be seen as a basis for
personal trust as well as trust in abstract systems.
Sztompka grasps trust as a bet about the contingent future actions of others.
In his theory – like Luhmann’s – the connection between risk and trust
plays a central role. Sztompka argues that the functions of trust occur on the
personal, communal and systemic level. Although the personal level of trust
is quite close to that of Luhmann’s concept of trust, the communal and
systemic level deals more with the discussions of social capital and the
cultural approach to trust than with Luhmann’s writings of the topic. In the
end, it seems that Sztompka’s concept of trust is an all-encompassing entity
that makes everyday life more safe and unproblematic.
The connection between trust and complexity in Vertrauen has already been
analysed, but a second question remains: how could this connection be
grasped in the context of his advanced systems theory? As long ago as the
early 1960s, Luhmann had become convinced that Parsons’ structural
functionalism had run its course without fulfilling its theoretical promise;
but also without exhausting the potential inherent in the prospect of a
sociological functionalism. One of Luhmann’s most important ambitions
was to create a theory whose aim was to reconstruct, not to eliminate, the
complexity of system-environment relations. This was where his concept of
trust came into play. An analysis of Luhmann’s concept of trust would be
incomplete as long as it remains examined in itself. A more interesting level
of analysis can be reached by fitting Luhmann’s concept of trust in the
context of his advanced systems theory. But before going into the
problematics of trust and confidence in the advanced systems theoretical
context in greater depth, we need to look at the basic concepts of this
theory: autopoiesis, meaning, double contingency, interpenetration or
structural coupling, communication, evolution, and differentiation, as
Luhmann presented them in his Soziale Systeme (1984).

66

<-----Page 80----->4. The Dynamics of Autopoietic Systems
In his book Soziale Systeme (1984, English edition 1995), Luhmann
provided us with what he himself later called the “introductory chapter” of
a general theory22 of modern society. In this book, he presented an attempt
“to reformulate the theory of social systems via the current state of the art in
general systems theory” (Luhmann 1984, 11). Luhmann thought that the
previous attempts to use systems theory in the social sciences applied
cybernetic concepts too directly and suffered from the residual normative
orientations of Durkheim and Parsons, which he, like the structuralists and
post-structuralists, denounced as so much ‘Old-European humanism’. As a
matter of fact, Luhmann never got tired of criticising and taunting
contemporary sociology’s fascination for its founding fathers. In the preface
to Soziale Systeme, for example, he bluntly asserts that sociology is stuck in
a theory crisis. Raf Vanderstraeten (2002, 77) verbalises Luhmann’s
thoughts felicitously: “The discipline offers old bottles into which the data
of empirical research is poured.” Deviating from the founding fathers and
contemporary mainstream sociology, the central aim of Soziale Systeme is
to apply of the idea of autopoiesis to social systems.
After this enormous presentation of society (the book has over 600 pages),
Luhmann wrote several volumes (some of which have been published
posthumously) on the different subsystems (economy, science, art,
massmedia, religion, politics and education) of society: Die Wirtschaft der
Gesellschaft (1988b), Die Wissenschaft der Gesellschaft (1990b), Das
Recht der Gesellschaft (1993b), Die Kunst der Gesellschaft (1995b), Die
Realität des Massenmedien (1996b), Die Religion der Gesellschaft (2000),
Die Politik der Gesellschaft (2000b) and Das Erziehungssystem der

22
According to Arto Noro (2000, 321), general theories in sociology become ‘general’
through asking how ‘the society’, ‘the social’ or ‘the culture’ are constituting themselves,
and try then to answer what these elements are. Remarkable authors of general theories are
the likes of Max Weber, Talcott Parsons, Georg Simmel, Erving Goffman, Jürgen
Habermas and Niklas Luhmann.

67

<-----Page 81----->Gesellschaft (2002). Besides this, Luhmann made interventions into
different spheres of society: trust (Vertrauen, 1968; English version 1979),
power (Macht, 1975), love and intimacy (Liebe als Passion, 1983), the
welfare state (Politische Theorie im Wohlfartsstaat, 1981), ecological
sociology (Ökologische Kommunikation, 1986; English version 1989),
decisions (Soziologie des Risikos, 1991) and modernity (Beobachtungen der
Moderne, 1992). Luhmann’s presentation of society culminated in his twovolume chef d’oeuvre Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft (1997). Near the
end of an amazingly productive career featuring over 400 articles and over
60 books, this work raises expectations of being the magnum opus of
possibly one of the great minds of twentieth-century sociology. That
impression is only enhanced by the tragic fact that Luhmann passed away
quite soon after its publication.
In general, it can be said that Luhmann’s production can be divided into
three different spheres (see Figure 2). The first and largest sphere of his
production concerns the problematics of social systems. This sphere
consists of Soziale Systeme, Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft and the
books on the different subsystems as well as his six-part Soziologische
Aufklärung (1970; 1975b; 1981b; 1987; 1990c; 1995c). Another sphere
consisting of the four-part Gesellschaftsstruktur und Semantik. Studien zur
Wissenssoziologie der modernen Gesellschaft (1980; 1981c; 1989b; 1995d)
concentrates on the semantic and historic analyses of society. The third
sphere consists of various interventions into society: trust, power, love etc.
In this work, I have examined the problematics of Luhmannian trust with
particular emphasis on the production of social systems and on (some of)
the interventions; I have consequently paid less attention to Luhmann’s
semantic and historic analyses of society. This is because my main purpose
is to examine how trust would function in the context of advanced systems
theory and not to analyse its historical or semantic development. On the
other hand, Luhmann’s semantic and historic thinking has affected the two
other spheres and inspired other system theorists (e.g. Rudolf Stichweh and
Risto Kangas) and thus indirectly this work as well.

Figure 2. The three main spheres of Luhmann’s production.
It may surprise anybody looking at this list of titles that Luhmann did not
primarily seek to a systematic catalogue containing almost everything of
any importance within society. His aim was different. Evidently, he wanted
to show that sociology has ability to cover everything that is social. Yet his
most important objective was to show the value of theoretical work in
sociology. For Luhmann, social differentiation and system formation are
the basic characteristics of modern society. (Kangas 1995, 219-248.) This
means that systems theory and the theory of society are mutually
dependent. According to Luhmann’s systems theory, society consists of
autopoietic social systems, and social systems consist of nothing but
communication.
For Luhmann, society is only one kind of social system; but it is the one
that includes all other social possibilities. Interactions are a second type of
social system, while organisations constitute a third type. It is important to
69

<-----Page 83----->note that society gurarantees the meaningfully self-referential closure of
communicative events, and thus the capacity to begin, end, and form
connections of the communications in each interaction. Although
interaction is communication, it is also perception. Moreover, it should be
noted that “perception is primarily a psychic acquisition of information, but
it becomes a social phenomenon, that is, an articulation of double
contingency, when one can perceive that one is perceived” (Luhmann 1995,
412). “Society is not possible without interaction nor interaction without
society, but the two types of system do not merge. Instead, they are
indispensable for each other in their difference.” (Luhmann 1995, 417.)
Although Luhmann makes the distinction between society, interactions, and
organisations, he stresses the unity of all forms of social systems – the fact
that they are carried by communication (see Luhmann 1997, 14).
In contrast to most other chroniclers of modernity (e.g. Weber), Luhmann’s
notion of society does not consist of collections of people. For him, the
central form of relationship in the social world is not that between
individual and society, but that between a social system and its
environment. In the following, I shall examine the most important
influences and basic concepts of Luhmann’s systems theory. The most
important question is: How does Luhmann conceive the allocation of
meaning (Sinn) for different things? This question leads us, then, to analyse
the way trust would function in the context of advanced systems theory.

The Influences and Basic Concepts of the Autopoietic
Systems Theory
There are four streams of thought in particular that influenced Luhmann’s
autopoietic systems theory. First, the systems-theoretical influence
originates from Luhmann’s time spent studying under Parsons at Harvard.
As noted in chapter three, in Parsons’ (1966; 1971) theory of modernity –
theory of action systems – differentiation of subsystems is accompanied by
adaptive upgrading, inclusion and generalisation of the values that make up
70

<-----Page 84----->the shared symbolic order. This is to say, Parsons’ action theory relates to
human action, and to the way that the integration of shared normative
structures reflecting people’s needs make social order possible. He is
concerned with the integration of particular people into the society’s
structure through norms and roles. Parsons’ importance becomes visible in
the cybernetic influence on Luhmann’s work; first of all, by showing the
social system as an ‘organic’ system, capable of self-regulation. Moreover,
the notion of ‘symbolic’ plays a significant role in both theories. Hence
Luhmann took up Parsons’ notion of symbolic media. (Arnoldi 2001, 3.)
This means that Parsons regards societal rationalisation, and Luhmann
societal differentiation, as a process through which distinct systems of
action (Parsons) or communication (Luhmann) emerge and differentiate
themselves, without individual or personal determination. Through this
process, they both argue, the rationality which motivates and structures
human life-forms exists independently of subjective-rational motivations, or
of other types of consistently reflected self-interest, and each system
develops its own internal value-patterns and its own symbolic media. (See
King & Thornhill 2003, 161-162.)
Despite his admiration for Parsons, Luhmann in many respects broke away
from Parsons’ structural functionalism. Luhmann refused to accept Parsons’
optimistic and rather simplistic belief that the problems of subjective
contingency had already been solved by the existing social system, or that
they could ever be solved by any future social system (see Luhmann 1976).
Parsons sees a social system as a component of a specific society, and he
concludes that the actions which it incorporates can be organised by means
of values, motivations, resources and legal norms, so that they contribute to
the security of that society. In Luhmanns theory, norms and values play
only a peripheric role (Kangas 2001, 76; 138). From Luhmann’s
perspective, this means “that Parsons’ model of socio-systemic evolution is
still founded in a rather simplistic construct of original human attributes and
behavioural

orientations

which

provide

imperatives

for

systemic

organization” (King & Thornhill 2003, 163). Furthermore, instead of
71

<-----Page 85----->focusing his attention to action, like Parsons does, Luhmann concentrates
on communication; for Luhmann, social systems are not systems of action,
but of communication. Stichweh (2001, 9101) describes Luhmann’s and
Parsons’ unusual intellectual relation with the following words:
On the one hand Luhmann reconstructed point to point, often taking up
minor theoretical distinctions hidden in the appendices of the essays on
generalized media of exchange. On the other hand, the theory Luhmann
built via this reconstructive effort is very different from the Parsonsian
undertaking: an open, inductive list of function systems supplanting the
decutive logic of AGIL; World Society supersedes the solidarity-based
national communities Parsons postulates; neo-Darwinist evolutionary
theory pushes away the Parsonsian thinking in developmental trends; a
loose, heterachical arrangement of different theories is substituted for the
hierachical structure of the Parsonsian paradigm.
A second stream of influence can be derived from biology, from the work
of Chilean neuroscientists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. They
are often regarded as the founding fathers of the concept of autopoiesis
(‘auto’ meaning ‘self’ and ‘poiesis’ meaning to ’create’). They developed
the concept of autopoiesis to characterise living organisms; in other words,
it emerged as a biological concept. Autopoietic systems are at the same
time open and closed systems; open because they are influenced by their
environment, but also closed because environment does not directly
influence the structure and elementary processes of the systems. (Maturana
& Varela 1980.) A key element of autopoiesis is that systems are not
subject to environmental selection in a linear selection process, as
prescribed by classic biological models derived from Darwinism. Systems,
Maturana and Varela argue, interact with themselves. Besides which,
systems interact recursively in the same network of reactions that produced
them. This means that systems are not open to their environments, as
perceived by traditional open systems theory (Parsons); on the contrary,
they are closed, and this is what enables them to interact with themselves.

72

<-----Page 86----->In the 1980s Luhmann adapted the idea of autopoiesis to sociology.23
Luhmann’s theoretical innovation was to emphasise the way social systems
arise. Much like living organisms, social systems emerge through
autopoiesis, that is, they are generated and maintained exclusively by their
own internal operations, and yet remain open to their environments.
According to Luhmann (1984; 1995), all systems – social, psychic and
organic – have their own elements, which reproduce themselves. The
systems’ own reproduction is their highest priority and their respective
environments have no direct influence on their internal operations. Social
systems, in Luhmann’s sense, are operationally closed, but structurally
open, which means that they can respond to all conditions and events in
their environment. (Blühdorn 2000, 343.) Closure in this respect does not
mean that such systems are not able to experience contact with their
environments, but that the only mode of getting in contact is based on their
own operations. Autopoietic systems are self-referencing. In order to exist
over time they need to be able to reproduce themselves; thoughts must
reproduce thoughts, just as actions must reproduce actions and
communication must reproduce communication. (Kangas 1995, 242-248.)
A third stream that stimulated Luhmann’s autopoietic theory comes from
philosophy, notably from Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology. If we agree
with Luhmann that autopoietic systems are self-referencing, this raises
many major questions. One is how to understand or observe the world, to
allocate meaning (Sinn) to different things. We have now arrived at the
notion of an observer and a point of convergence for Luhmann and Husserl,
who, according to Jacob Arnoldi (2003, 407) “is a major influence on
Niklas Luhmann’s theory of sense making systems”. In phenomenology
23

It must be mentioned here that Maturana and Varela expressed their scepticism about
applying autopoiesis to social systems. Nevertheless, Luhmann worked for many years to
apply autopoiesis to social systems. However, Luhmann was not the only sociologist who
was convinced that autopoiesis might have something to do with social systems. The social
systems theorist Stafford Beer (1980) commented that autopoiesis has considerable
potential for the study of social systems. At around the same time, Giddens arrived at a
similar conclusion. He argued that although the functional analogies are so strongly
represented in the history of sociology, few sociologists have concerned themselves with
recursive or self-producing systems (Giddens 1979, 75).

73

<-----Page 87----->(Husserl), the observer would be Ego; it would be the Ego that observes or
experiences. In autopoietic systems theory this is impossible. Luhmann
operates with two different observers. One is the Ego, a conscious or
psychic system. The other type of observer is a social system. Social
systems

while

(consciousness or thoughts of a human being) observe via cognition. What
happens, either through a cognitive act or a communicative event, is that
something, through a distinction, is the centre of either cognitive or
communicative attention. (Luhmann 1992, 98; Arnoldi 2001, 5.)
A fourth stream of influence comes (surprisingly) from mathematics.The
autopoietic event for a meaning-processing system is, for Luhmann, the act
of drawing distinctions. Around this concept, Luhmann ‘meets’ both
Husserl and the logician George Spencer-Brown. For Luhmann, who from
the beginning was much inspired by Husserl, Spencer-Brown’s logic is a
description of the most basic operation through which anything meaningful
or intelligible manifests itself for the observer. Logic is concerned with
distinctions.
The very foundation of any observation, of any meaningful ‘experience’, is
the drawing of a distinction between ‘this’ and ‘other’ or ‘inside’ and
‘outside’. Through this basic operation ‘something’ becomes distinct from
‘other’ and thus intelligible – as it now is distinct. This notion of
distinction-form is the core of Luhmann’s notion of meaning. Before the
distinction there is only void but through the event in which a distinction is
constituted there is form, there is meaning. (Arnoldi 2001, 4.)
Through observing we are conceiving meanings in different things and
concepts but observing must be active so that we are able to draw
distinctions.24 This type of autopoietic operation is temporal, which means
that new operations are constantly required in order to secure the
continuation of autopoiesis. Despite this, meaning can be used also
24
For Luhmann concepts are distinctions, although distinctions need not be concepts. Only
‘Sinnsysteme’, that is, psychic and social systems, use distinctions that are concepts.
Concepts need not be linguistically articulated, although ‘Sinnsysteme’ often use language
to express their thoughts or articulate their communications. (Christis 2001, 328.)

74

<-----Page 88----->recursively (Luhmann 1995, 95). This is because meaning can be stored in
symbolic generalisations, mostly in language and habits, and can thus be
used again.

The Two Meaning-Processing Systems
It is easy to agree with Luhmann that consciousness can produce meanings,
but it might sound counter-intuitive that communication systems are also
able to produce meanings. Here we must notice that although Husserl is a
major influence on Luhmann, he “abandons the notion of lifeworld, of
shared meanings, and instead develops a theory of social systems as
communicative systems” (Arnoldi 2003, 407). Such systems operate
through processes of sense making similar to that of cognitive systems.
However, both meaning-processing system types – communicative and
cognitive – are autopoietic and the difference lies in the mode of
autopoiesis. Communicative systems produce, as their temporal elements,
communication, while psychic systems produce cognitive operations.
Following this theory, it becomes clear that there cannot be intersubjectivity
(see Luhmann 1986b). Communication is not a direct transmission of
meaning or information between persons. As Jakob Arnoldi (2001, 6) notes:
“Communication forms a closed system in relation to which the persons
‘communicating’ belong to the environment.” In other words, this
‘communicating’ takes place between at least two Egos who cannot know
one another’s real thoughts. This encounter is always double contingent.25
Double contingency means that participants are opaque and incalculable to

25
The concept of double contingency is originally sketched out by Talcott Parsons. For
him the concept is an important element of the problem of social order. According to
Parsons (1977), double contingency refers to the indeterminate situation arising from the
general interdependence among interacting actors. In a simplified, dyadic model of
interaction between ego and alter, ego’s action is not only oriented to his expectation of
that of alter, but also to ego’s expectation of his own action. The same applies to alter. A
problem of complementarity of expectations thus results (Parsons and Shils 1951, 15-16).
Double contingency is, then, the indeterminacy of action that arises as “each actor is both
an acting agent and object of orientation both to himself and to the others” (Parsons 1977,
167). Without resolving this elemental indeterminacy, social interaction could never occur
and the constitution of social order could never be possible (see Chen 2004).

75

<-----Page 89----->one another. 26 Hence, one can also talk of ego and alter as black boxes.
“The basic situation of double contingency is then simple: two black boxes,
by whatever accident, come to have dealings with one another” (Luhmann
1995, 109). These boxes cannot really understand each other, but they can
create sufficient transparency or ‘whiteness’ for dealing with one another
(Vanderstraeten 2002, 85).
However, it would be incorrect to say that communicative and cognitive
observations would be totally independent of one another. Our thoughts
obviously affect our communication and vice versa. Luhmann developed
the concept of interpenetration27 to describe the relationship between these
systems. In other words, interpenetration deals with the way psychic and
social systems depend on each other to produce themselves. It does not
refer to a comprehensive system of coordination or to an operative process
of exchange (something that would require the ability to talk about inputs
and outputs in this sense). Interpenetration can only mean: the unity and
complexity of the one is given a function within the system of the other.
“The way in which this occurs can be demonstrated only in the structures
and operation of each individual system; it could not occur otherwise.
Interpenetration therefore takes a different form in systems of the mind than
in systems of communication.” (Luhmann 2002b, 182.) Interpeneration
makes it easier to understand why the concept of meaning must be
employed on such a high theoretical level.

26
For Luhmann, the concept of contingency describes “something given (something
experienced, expected, remembered, fantasized) in the light of its possibly being otherwise;
it describes objects within the horizon of possible variations” (Luhmann 1995c, 106). This
means that ego’s action is not contingent while it depends on another actor, but while it
presupposes a selection from a range of alternative options. Reason for this is that selfreferential systems do not involve a selection of pre-constituted elements that eventually
enter into a relationship with each other; rather, it is only through the constitution of the
system as a whole that its elements are produced. For Luhmann, then, the double
contingent character of social interaction is mutatis mutandis, a consequence not of the
mutual dependency of ego and alter, but of the confrontation of at least two autonomous
systems that make their own selection in relation to one another (Vanderstraeten 2002, 84).
27
In his later ’autopoietic’ writings Luhmann mostly uses the concept of structural
coupling that became the byword for interpenetration.

76

<-----Page 90----->Meaning enables the psychic and social system formations to interpenetrate,
while protecting their autopoiesis; meaning simultaneously enables
consciousness to understand itself and continue to affect itself in
communication, and enables communication to be referred back to the
consciousness of the participants. Therefore the concept of meaning
supersedes the concept of the animal sociale. (Luhmann 1995, 219.)
To conclude, autopoietic systems are self-referencing; they have their own
elements which re-produce themselves. Luhmann operates with two
different observers and meaning-processing systems, psychic and social
(see Figure 3). Psychic systems operate via cognition, while social systems
operate via communication. Furthermore, for being able to operate further,
systems must make distinctions. They are not completely independent of
one another, but because of interpenetration, consciousness indirectly
affects communication and vice versa.28

28

According to Paul Stenner (2004, 167), inter(re)ference by structural coupling [or
interpenetration] is necessarily indirect, since each operative level functions only as
environment to the others. Nevertheless, consciousness, for instance, can irritate or
otherwise indirectly stimulate the system of communication that is its environment.
Likewise, organic activity can irritate consciousness. In any given act of communication,
consciousness is already fully present. Despite this, “they pass each other by like ships in
the night, silently altering their mutual courses by way of the waves their movements cause
in the shared medium of the ocean. Each operative level is distinct (only consciousness is
conscious, only communication communicates), but without consciousness, there can be
no communication, and without brain biochemistry, there can be no consciousness.”
(Stenner 2004, 167.)

77

<-----Page 91----->These observations about Luhmann’s systems theory raise several
intriguing questions with regard to the main objective of this book, namely,
the examination of trust in the context of advanced systems theory. First, if
we agree that there are two autopoietic, self-referential observers – the
psychic and social systems – there must also be two different meanings for
trust. How is the meaning-processing of trust by psychic systems different
from that of social systems? Second, if communicative and cognitive
observations are not completely independent of one another, due to their
interpenetration, how do the different meanings of trust (psychic and social)
affect one another? Third, living under the conditions of double
contingency, how does one decide how and whom to trust?
However, these questions have to do with the meaning-related problems of
trust within psychic (consciousness) and social (communication) systems.
Communication and cognition are not enough to explain larger problems of
meaning and trust because observation is highly temporal. In addition, the
meaning-processing systems of the present moment are affected by their
history, environment and future. Therefore, a further analysis of Luhmann’s
conceptions of communication, evolution and functional differentiation is
necessary before we turn to an advanced concept of trust.

Three Dimensions of Meaning
A comprehensive conception of meaning can be found in the core chapters
of Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft (1997), where Luhmann presents three
principal components of his general theory: communication, evolution, and
differentiation. Every social system, he asserts, engages in autopoiesis to
make meaningful distinctions in three separate dimensions: the social,
temporal, and factual (Sozial, Zeit-, and Sachdimensionen) (Luhmann 1997,
1136-1138). Autopoiesis refers to the system’s ability to create itself in
opposition to its environment. Everything that is used as a unit by the
systems is produced by the system itself. This applies to elements,
processes, boundaries, and other structures, and last but not least, to the
78

<-----Page 92----->unity of the system itself. Autopoietic systems are thus sovereign with
respect to the constitution of identities and differences. (Luhmann 1995, 3436.) But as mentioned above, meaning-processing systems are observing
systems and make distinctions. Meaning-processing takes place within all
three dimensions.
Luhmann argues that the three dimensions of meaning cannot be
interchanged, and that each dimension is meaningful only in combination
with the other two. These dimensions are thus interpenetrative, affecting
each other indirectly. In the following sections I shall consider the functions
of these dimensions more closely, but in the way of generalisation, it can be
said that the social dimension produces the difference between the Ego and
Alter, the temporal dimension produces the difference between past and
future, and the factual dimension produces the difference between system
and environment. Luhmann provides the following delineation to illustrate
this dimensional thinking (Luhmann 1997, 1138):

<-----Page 93----->The Characteristics of Communication
In sociology, theorists have opted for different concepts such as action,
exchange, power or force to represent the basic unit of social reality.
Differing from these theories, Luhmann considers communication to be the
constitutive element of social reality. Luhmann’s writings seem to draw the
consequences from a number of post-war developments, which were
primarily initiated by the new technologies of information processing. “It
was Luhmann, in choosing communication theory over action theory, who
took on the role of the first major sociological communication theorist, a
role which had to be taken by someone anyway” (Stichweh 2000, 9.) The
wide-ranging implication of Luhmann’s view of communication can
already be seen in his essays from the late 1960s and 1970s, in which he
presented the foundations of his version of social systems theory for the
first time. It should be noted that during this period, Luhmann also wrote
his essay on Trust (Vertrauen, 1968). As discussed above, communication
plays an important role already in Vertrauen. However, the theory of
communication came increasingly to the fore since the publication of the
‘introductory chapter’ of Luhmann's theory of society, i.e. Soziale Systeme
(1984).
Communication is the constitutive element of self-referential social systems
which use it as their particular model of autopoietic reproduction. I would
even argue that the conception of communication is the foundation of
Luhmann’s systems theory. The significance of communication is
emphasised because it is one of the two meaning-processing systems and
societies are thus impossible without communication. As Luhmann (1990d,
145-146) notes:
Societies are a special case of self-referential systems. They presuppose a
network of communications, previous communications and further
communications and also communications that happen elsewhere.
Communications are possible only within a system of communication and
this system cannot escape the form of recursive circularity. Its basic events,
the single units of communication, are units only by reference to other units
80

<-----Page 94----->within the same system. In consequence, only the structure of this system
and not its environment can specify the meaning of communications.
According to this view, communications do not establish a connection with
external reality, but recursively construct communications networks. A
communication

thus

necessitates

a

new

communication.

Each

communication “is an element only as an element of a process, however
minimal or ephemeral that process may be” (Luhmann 1995, 144.).
Communications conclude preceding communications and allow them to be
connected. These elements of social systems organise their own renewal;
they operate autopoietically. However, Luhmann’s view of communication
differs considerably from the traditional sender-receiver model which can
be sketched in the following way:
Customarily, communication is described by means of a metaphor of
‘transmission’. Communication is the transmission of messages or
information form one place (the sender) to another place (the receiver) by
means of medium. It includes processes of encoding by the sender in order
to get the message through the medium, and the processes of decoding by
the receiver in order to get at the meaning of the encoded message.
(Vanderstraeten 2000, 585-6.)
The development of society has not been as causal as this model assumes.
Furthermore, as Vanderstraten (2000, 586) notes, “the transmission
metaphor prematurely assumes an identity of what is transmitted.” Only
very seldom is the information that has been sent the same for the sender
and the receiver. A more usual situation – which can be seen as a situation
of double contingency – is that information might mean something very
different for the two persons involved. The content of the information
cannot guarantee its identity.
Luhmann focuses on communication as an occurrence or event which
emerges from the processing of three independent selections: information,
utterance and understanding (see Kangas 1995, 238-242). The logic of
Luhmannian communication can be explained in the following way: “In
information it is a matter of what we utter, in utterance how we utter it and
81

<-----Page 95----->in understanding the separation of uttered information from the way we
utter it. Understanding consists of the communicative actions through
which the receiver reacts to the message.” (Jalava 2003, 179.) In its
simplest terms, communication is thus an emergent, three-part unity and a
way of processing information (see Figure 5, which has been modified by
the original idea of Detlef Krause [2001, 35] ).

Figure 5. The process of communication.

For Luhmann, information (or data) is selected from numerous possibilities.
This selected information should be provided in a form which the sender
and the addressee are able to understand. Therefore, communication also
requires an adequate standardisation of the utterance that expresses the
information. This utterance can occur intentionally or unintentionally, but it
must always be interpretable as selection, and not just appear as a sign of
something else. (Vanderstraeten 2003, 135.) As Luhmann (1995, 151) says,
“In this sense, rushing about can be observed as a sign of urgency, just like
dark clouds as a sign of rain. But it can also be interpreted as a
82

Psychic
system 2.

<-----Page 96----->demonstration of urgency, or of being busy, or of having no time to stop
and talk, and so on.” This difference between the two interpretations also
stresses the importance of the last selection of communication, i.e.
understanding. What is important with regard to understanding is the fact
that this third selection can be based on a distinction, namely the distinction
between information and its utterance. Understanding is more than mere
observation of the message.29 It only takes place, as noted above, if the
receiver construes the information from the utterance. This does not mean
that the receiver understands the information as it was intended by the
sender. On the contrary, the information might mean something very
different for both participants. Communication is always double
contingent.30 Therefore, “understanding for Luhmann is not a psychic
reality, but a part of the three-selection-process of communication, in which
communication itself has understood if and how the next communication
connects. This does not foreclose psychic understanding, but only
communication can understand what has been communicated.” (Nassehi
2005, 5.)
Since, as we have seen, society consists of the totality of all meaningful
communications, it follows that no communications can exist outside
society, so society cannot communicate with its environment or, as
Luhmann (1988c, 18) says “it can find no addresses outside itself to which
it can communicate anything”. Consciousness cannot communicate and
does not, therefore, belong to the society. As noted above, Luhmann refers
to consciousness and society (communication) as being ‘interpenetrated’ in
the sense that each constructs the other within its environment and their

29
Observation is simply the psychic system’s ability to make distinctions. We all make
distinctions and thus understand information in a different way. This deviant understanding
increases complexity. Complexity itself is limited understanding. It is the absence of
information that makes full comprehension of a system impossible. (Luhmann 1995, 2728.)
30
Here I consider only the three basic components of communication. However, I would
like to note that the acceptance or rejection of a communication can be identified as the
fourth component of communicative event, but it is already a part of the next

83

<-----Page 97----->operations assume the existence of the other, but each remains separate and
distinct with no direct communication between them being possible.
Wherein, then, lies the uniqueness of this concept of communication? First
of all, the distinction among the three components (information, utterance
and understanding) is new. One finds a similar distinction in Karl Bühler,
made from the point of view of different functions of linguistic
communication. Anglo-American thinkers like Austin and Searle have
augmented and rigified this into a theory of types of acts or speech acts.
Furthermore, Jürgen Habermas (whose critique against Luhmann I examine
later) has presented a typology of validity claims implicit in
communication. But as Luhmann (2002b, 159-160) says, “all of this still
proceeds from an action-theoretical understanding of communication and
therefore sees the procedure of communication as a successful or
unsuccessful transference of news, information, or suppositions of
agreement.” Second, contrary to action-theoretical understanding, a
systems-theoretical approach emphasises the emergence of communication
itself. Nothing is transferred.
Evolution and ‘Disappearance’ of the Individual
By now it seems obvious that the traditional sender-receiver model does not
conform to Luhmann’s model of communication. Furthermore, although all
dimensions are meaningful only in combination with the other two, it is
clear that the social dimension, wherein the difference between Ego and
Alter constructs itself through communication, appears to be the central
one. From the society’s point of view, evolution and differentiation of the
systems are possible only if there is communication first.
The importance of the three-part concept of communication, as well as the
problems of trust, can be understood better if we consider the role of the
communication, thereby securing the sequential unity of a communication (see Stichweh
2001, 9098).

84

<-----Page 98----->individual in society. Namely, Luhmann rejects the ‘Old-European’ notion
that individuals participate in a naturally ordered society as whole beings.
One reason for Luhmann’s rejection of ‘the individual’ as the unit of
sociological analysis concerns his historical account of social evolution.
Those individualising theories which may once have been accepted as
adequate sociological accounts of the way that traditional societies
understood themselves can today offer only partial, incomplete and limited
explanations of the complexities of modern society. Luhmann (1986c, 318)
writes that “in stratified societies the human individual was regularly placed
in only one social system. Social status (condition, qualité, état) was the
most stable characteristic of an individual’s personality”. This is no longer
possible in modern society, which – as will be explained in more detail later
– Luhmann considers as differentiated into social function systems that
provide a firm definition of a person’s social standing or status. In
functionally differentiated society, “nobody can live in only one of these
[functional] systems” (Luhmann 1986c, 318).
Furthermore, autopoietic systems preclude humanism. There is no
autopoietic unity of all the autopoietic systems that compose the human
being. “Certainly mind and brain never will build one closed, circular, selfreferential autopoietic system, because thoughts, as elements of the mind,
cannot be identified with single neurophysiologic events, as elements of the
brain” (Luhmann 1986c, 323). Therefore, Luhmann suggests, the
fundamental unit of society is communication, not the individual.
Individuals, seen as separate entities, are socially meaningless. One does
not locate society inside individuals but between them. Society exists only
when individuals communicate. Until they begin to communicate,
individuals are not in society. And when they do communicate - when they
do participate in society - individuals do so to a very limited extent, never
as “whole persons”. The limits of society are established by the limits of
communication. All that is not communicated remains outside of society.
(Lee 2000, 322; see also Luhmann 1997, 26.)
Social systems are, thus, not made up of people, but consist only of
communication as the synthesis of the differentiation among information,
85

<-----Page 99----->utterance and understanding. Therefore – as I will show in chapter five –
also the advanced Luhmannian problematics of trust is primarily connected
with communication and not (only) with people. What, then, is the status of
the individual person in Luhmannian social systems? Or, as Luhmann
(1986c, 318) asks: “If the individual cannot live in ‘his’ social system,
where else can he live?” Luhmann’s answer is to see the individual as an
observer of society, without an existence within society.
The individual leaves the world in order to look at it. I interpret this
extramundane position of the transcendental subject as a symbol for the
new position of the empirical individual in relation to a system of functional
subsystems. He does not belong to any of them in particular, but depends
on their interdependence. (Luhmann 1986b, 319).
Luhmann views individuals as self-referring systems, but not as social
systems. Persons, in Luhmann’s scheme, exist both as biological or living
systems and as psychic systems. Living systems exist within and perform
their operations directly upon media that exist in the natural world, such as
temperature, pressure, viruses, bacteria and other living organisms. For
psychic systems the medium is consciousness. This consists of all thought
as well as feelings and emotions in so far as the individual being system is
able to give them meaning and significance. (King & Thornhill 2003, 4.)
This does not mean that individuals do not have any role in producing and
reproducing communication (and thus, also trust). But they cannot
communicate continually. As Kangas (2001, 286) notes: “In a functionally
differentiated society people participate in the functions of the different
subsystems only sporadically”. They can be seen as “carriers of
communication” forming a common ground for the operations of different
systems, and suppliers of the basis for inter-systemic communication (see
Hagen 2000, 34). This means, for example, that one individual can properly
assume something about the other psychic system’s experience on the basis
of what has been communicated. The actions of psychic systems (thoughts
of an individual) are thus more or less influenced – or in Luhmann’s
terminology interpenetrated – by the ‘carried’ communication. We can
86

<-----Page 100----->observe the essential nature of the other and listen to his communication,
but we could not know his real thoughts, his inner being. This explains,
why

“a

person

cannot

communicate,

only

communication

can

communicate…There is no communication between this consciousness and
that consciousness that is no social…Only a consciousness can think, and
only society can communicate.” (Luhmann 1997, 105.)
Communication between people thus helps to speed up the process of
gathering and sorting out information about one’s environment. From an
evolutionary point of view, it is important to note that people need different
types of forms and media for co-operation. As noted above, Luhmann takes
his account of the way in which systems in general ‘perceive’ and
‘understand’ through differentiation and self-reference from SpencerBrow’s logic. The more complex aspect of communications that Luhmann
identifies, concerns their central role in what he describes as “a differencetheoretical theory of form” (Luhmann 2000c, 28). In his view,
communications require ‘articulated forms’. They require these, first of all,
“to serve as a condition for the cooperation of disparate psychic systems
(people) that perceive words or signs as differences” and so ensure “the
connectivity of communications” (Luhmann 2000c, 18). Secondly,
communication also needs articulated forms because “they must have
recourse to past and future communications, that is, it must be able to
identify something as repeatable” (Luhmann 2000c, 18). This is not simply
a matter of situating the communication in time; communications must also
be able to refer back to previous communications and the possibility of
future communications of the same kind. They provide the form with an
identity and continuity. (King & Thornhill 2003, 13.)
Media are specific forms of social co-ordination; they are the most constant
dynamics

of

social

in

societies.

Evolutionarily, Luhmann theorises three kinds of media: oral language,
mass or diffusion media (writing and printing) and generalised symbolic
media of communication. Luhmann (1995, 157-163) says that there is one
87

<-----Page 101----->type of medium linked to each stage of social evolution: oral languages
correspond

to

segmented

societies;

mass

diffusion

media

(Verbreitungsmedien) to stratified societies, and generalised symbolic
media to functionally differentiated societies. However, this does not mean
that the generalised media (money, power, law, etc.) would not have existed
in segmented or stratified societies at all, but the form of these media was
different than in functionally differentiated societies. Therefore, it cannot be
said that there is only one type of medium linked to each stage of social
evolution.
Forms and media are bound to time. Luhmann (1976b, 135) defines time as
“the interpretation of reality with regard to the difference between past and
future”. But all this takes place against a background of time passing. In
this manner, “two kinds of present always exist simultaneously and it is
only the difference between them that creates the impression of the flow of
time” (Luhmann 1995, 78). One “occurs in a regular manner”, indicates
through, for example, “the hand of a watch, sounds, movements, the
crashing of waves that something is always changing irreversibly”
(Luhmann 1995, 78). Because the world changes frequently enough, this
first kind of ‘present’ is symbolised as the inevitability of the flow of time.
The second kind of present, “the standardized scheme of movement and of
time”, takes place in the system’s environment (Luhmann 1976b, 135).
Time is constructed by systems to make sense of, or give meaning to, their
own operations (for example decisions), all of which take place in the
present. This second kind of present is, according to Luhmann (1976b, 135;
King&Thornhill 2003, 27), “the space of time between past and future in
which an event becomes irreversible…The present lasts as long as it takes
for something to become irreversible”.
The evolution31 of forms and the three media (oral language, mass or
diffusion media and generalised symbolic media) has followed the logic of
31

It must be mentioned that here I do not speak about biological evolution but cultural
historical evolution.

88

<-----Page 102----->time. Evolution has been irreversible. Yet this does not mean that the forms
and the media or societies are results of a factual sequence of events,
according to which the present is understood as the effect of past causes or
as the cause of future events – i.e. what the events meant within the context
of past societies or will mean in the context of future societies. For
Luhmann (1995, 79-80), “history operates as a release from sequence”. It
“is always present past or present future, always an abstention from pure
sequence, and always a reduction of the freedom of immediate access to all
that is past and all that is future” (Luhmann 1995, 79-80). The evolution of
the form, the media and societies is thus bound to the relevance of time.
This means that all societies have had different capacities for mediating the
relations between past and future in a present.
Because of the evolution of the society, people need each other, although
they cannot fully know the thoughts of others. They have an even lesser
capacity for knowing the information and functions of mass media and
functionally differentiated media (such as money, power and law). This of
course increases risks and uncertainty. The development or evolution of
communication has increased complexity and contingency. Luhmann
rejects the optimistic notion of evolutionary progress and dismisses the idea
that complex systems are better than simple ones. Rather, the more complex
a system, the more things can go wrong, and the more there is
unfamiliarity.32 Within the dimension of time, societal systems coevolve by
heaping communication upon communication, one bit after another. There
are no natural laws that determine how meanings must be combined.
Autopoiesis, functioning in the present, produces structures that,
recursively, produce future structures.

32
Nonetheless, Luhmann does not see complexity and contingency in as alarming terms as
for example Jürgen Habermas (1992, 138). According to Luhmann, the distinction
complexity/simplicity no longer holds because in the modern world the search for an
underlying simplicity has become futile. As a matter of fact, complexity guarantees
contingency which, in turn, describes something given in the light of it possibly being
otherwise.

89

<-----Page 103----->Differentiation and Structural Coupling
Thus far we have concentrated on ‘persons’ or observers as psychic and
social systems. We have seen how they construct their meaning-processing
through communication which enables the difference between Ego and
Alter, between two ‘black boxes’. We have also seen how communication
(or a way of using of communication media) affects the observer’s
evolution. How can we then perceive the third dimension of systems, the
factual one? “One can speak of the fact dimension in relation to all objects
of meaningful intentions (in psychic systems) or themes of meaningful
communication (in social systems). The fact dimension is constituted in that
meaning divides the reference structure of what is meant into ‘this’ and
‘something else’” (Luhmann 1995, 76). Factual communication – to which
the present work especially concentrates – is largely affected by the
differentiation of society.
Society, for Luhmann, is a world society. This means that, society consists
of communication and represents the boundaries and the limits of all that is
recognised as societal communications and transmittable as such. However,
precisely what is meant by ‘world society’ will vary both historically and
culturally in the sense that organisations of communication subsystems will
provide different versions of what that world comprises of. Michael King
and Chris Thornhill (2003, 8) outline some examples of the Luhmannian
‘world society’:
If, for example, communication subsystems are organised feudally in a
hierarchical manner according to rank or status, reinforced by a belief that
this organization reflects a divine ordering of humanity, what is understood
by ‘the world will appear very different from modern society…Society’s
environment will also differ, for both ‘nature’ and ‘consciousness’ will be
understood in different ways. An example of a society where
communications are organized in a relatively simple manner would be a
completely isolated tribe in the Borneo jungle. Yet, even here, the society
of the tribe is a ‘world society’ in that it does not know or understand
anything outside the boundaries of its own knowledge, and the environment
for that tribe would be limited by its own understanding of ‘nature’ and
consciousness’.
90

<-----Page 104----->In a world society the difference between centre and periphery loses
meaning due to assimilation and globalisation, and differentiation in society
becomes functional.33 Functionally differentiated society lacks overall
integration, and it operates without a top and without a centre (Luhmann
1997, 803). For Luhmann, the evolution of society’s subsystems did not
happen in any purposeful or rational way, but through a process in which
information was selected and given meaning as communication. The world
society consists of functionally differentiated autopoietic subsystems, such
as the economy, family, religion, law, politics, science, education, art, mass
media, the medical system etc. In their production of communications these
systems transform information into meaning, and without their operations
meaning, and hence the society, could not exist. Each of these systems is
specialised, fulfilling one and only one function for the society. (Luhmann
1997; Hagen 2000, 28-29.) For example, the economy responds to and
regulates scarcity for society via payments and so removes anxiety
regarding the future satisfaction of needs (Luhmann 1988b); politics
provides society with the means of making collectively binding decisions
(Luhmann 1981); law stabilises normative expectations in the face of
actions that contradict such expectations (Luhmann 1993b); and science
provides a way of distinguishing between what is true or likely to be true
and what is not (Luhmann 1990b).
The subsystems became functional as soon as other communicative systems
began to rely upon their communications. Thus systems are functional in so
far as they are able to organise communications and disseminate them in
ways which enable them and other communicative systems to make use of
them. In other words, functional systems can observe other systems within
33

According to this evolutionary scheme, the structural change that occurred no later than
the end of the eighteenth century is best described not as the emergence of bourgeois
capitalist society but rather as the shift from social stratification, in which the unity of
society is represented by a unity at the ‘top’ (court), to a plurality of functionally
differentiated social systems, with no one system able to represent the unity of the whole,
and certainly with no ‘life-world’ serving as watchtower overseeing and disciplining the
individual function systems. (Luhmann 1982, 229-254; 1997, 707-706; Rasch 2000.)

91

<-----Page 105----->their environment and are able to refer to the communication of other
systems in their own communication. However, because of autopoiesis and
operational closure34 systems can only indirectly affect each other. This is
possible, for example, through interpenetration (or structural coupling). It
can also be said that system differentiation is important for the continuity of
society. Although differentiation increases complexity, it also enables new
forms for reducing complexity. As Luhmann (1995, 192) puts it:
Every subsystem takes on, so to speak, a part of the overall complexity in
that it simultaneously orients itself only to its own system/environment
difference, yet with this reconstructs the overall system for itself. The
subsystem relieves the strain on itself by assuming that many of the
reproductive requirements needed in the overall system are fulfilled
elsewhere by other subsystems. Doing so it doubles the subsystem’s
dependence on the overall system: it is itself a part of the overall system,
and it is at the same time dependent on the internal environment and thus
once again, but in another way, on the overall system.
Each societal system is autopoietic, has its own environment, and operates
according to its own form, medium, code and programmes. For being able
to make distinctions and ‘understand’ their environment, functional
subsystems need articulated forms in which their media function. This is
where the binary codes come to the fore. The notion that systems
distinguish themselves and make sense of their environments through their
own particular binary code can be traced back to Parsons’ symbolically
generalised media, which Luhmann refers to as the symbolically
generalised media of communication. According to this model, each sphere
of social activity sees the world in its own terms.
However, “it was only after Luhmann’s adoption and adaptation for social
theory of the biological notion of autopoiesis that he came to see codes and
programmes as central to the operation of systems” (King & Thornhill
34
Operational closure means that systems are unable to communicate directly with one
another, for each system uses different criteria of validity, different forms of authority and
different codes for deriving meaning from and assessing the value of information. They see
things differently and there is no possibility of one system being able to internalise the
world-view of another. (King & Thornhill 2003, 27.)

92

<-----Page 106----->2003, 23). The function systems have evolved over centuries and, as noted
above, one of their basic evolutionary conditions is the creation of
symbolically generalised media. Symbolically generalised media are
general in the sense that everything can be communicated in terms of one
media.
For example, everything can be communicated in terms of money.
Everything can be priced. Symbolically generalised media are symbolic in
the sense that they are condensed coins, bank notes, and today also credit
cards. The symbolically generalised establish all communicative codes that
demarcate communication on the fact dimension. (Andersen 2003, 155.)
Codes need to be understood as special types of distinction that exist only
within the system and can only be operated by the systems. “The code, the
unity of this specific difference, is sufficient to determine which operations
belong to the system and which operations (coded differently or not coded
at all) are going on in the environment of the system” (Luhmann 2000d,
17). Codes are the abstract and universally applicable distinctions between
positive and negative values – for example government/opposition
(politics), lawful/unlawful (law), true/false (science), and information/noninformation (mass media) – which allow systems to give meaning to their
environment. The fact that the code is binary also means that they divided
the world in two halves. The whole world is comprehensible through the
code. Therefore, when the communication links up with a symbolically
generalised medium, it can only link itself to either the positive side or the
negative side in the code. There is no third value. (Luhmann 1986d; 2000d.)
For Luhmann (1993b, 78), the system’s code represents “the form with
which the system distinguishes itself from the environment and organizes
its own operative closure.”
If codes exist only within the system and can only be operated by the
system, programmes, for their part, are a necessary filter for this operation.
Without them, the application of codes would appear as crude attempts to
reduce everything in the world to simplistic binary propositions.
“Programming complements coding, filling it with content” (Luhmann
93

<-----Page 107----->1993b, 190; King & Thornhill 2003, 23). Through abstract codes systems
give meaning to their environment, but their operation is always mediated
by the system’s programmes. The essential difference between programmes
and codes is that “programmes can be modified or replaced, but the code
remains identical throughout and identifies the system itself” (Luhmann
1986d, 195; King & Thornhill 2003, 24). Programmes can be thought of as
the explicit forms of codes. Government platforms, for example, are visible
programs through which the government uses its media of power. These
platforms follow the binary codes government/governed and, in democratic
societies, government/opposition. Although the platform would be replaced
by the change of government, the codes still remain the same. Despite the
visible character of programmes, codes are always more important.
Programmes do not determine the nature of the coding; rather, it is the code
which generates the programmes and gives them their appearance of
continuity and rationality. While the code itself may be described as rigid
and invariant, programmes provide a flexibility, a plasticity which allows
them to be moulded into whatever has been pre-formulated (through the
system’s coding) as an issue for politics or law. (King & Thornhill 2003,
25-26.)
Each autonomous system directs its activities via communication, which is
to say, via binary coding. Science, for example, operates according to the
true/false

distinction,

economics

by

the

distinction

of

profitability/unprofitability and democratic politics by the distinction of
government/opposition, and so on, for the other differentiated systems and
subsystems of society. Functional systems as well as individuals-as-Egos
can only ‘understand’ or use their own distinctions. The more complex a
modern society becomes, the more it depends on a high level of efficiency
and specialisation achieved in each system. With greater differentiation,
there is more communication, binary codes and programmes. The more
communication, the larger the society becomes. This also means that
‘people’ are more dependent on different subsystems all the time but also
on other ‘people’ (mostly as social and psychic systems, but sometimes also
as organic systems) in their environment. We are meeting new and strange
94

<-----Page 108----->‘people’ every day and many subsystems of society (law, politics, economy
etc.) are affecting us almost constantly.
However, although all systems are autopoietic and do not have direct
contact with each other, systems can ‘irritate’ one another, possibly leading
to the creation of operational and structural couplings (the term can be here
seen as synonymous for interpenetration) between systems. “The concept of
structural coupling is meant to explain how a system can be both
operationally closed and dependent on the environment. The environment is
not part of the system, but is still significant for the operations of the
system.” (Hagen 2000, 32.) Structural coupling, therefore, relates to the coevolution of different systems whereby each includes the other in its
environment, interpreting the outputs of the other in its own terms on a
continuous basis.35 Each subsystem has structural couplings to many others.
For example, the structural coupling of law and politics is regulated by the
constitution, that of law and economics through property and contract.
Universities couple science and education, while experts make science
available to politics. But, as Hagen (2000, 32) notes, “structural couplings
are nothing by themselves. They are external observations of system-tosystem causalities explained as the outcome of evolution.” After all,
without structural couplings, systems would be unable to refer to other
systems’ communication in their own communication.They need structural
couplings in order to become more complex and developed parts of the
society.

35
Following Paul Stenner’s (2004, 167) peculiar reading, the irritation posed by structural
coupling is always parasitical. “Such parasitical irritations are constantly occurring at the
invisible thresholds between discrete operative levels, and serve to mutually structure these
levels through incessant provocation.” In abstract terms, a system can produce parasitic
noise, but can also appear, in Stenner’s words, as a parasite that by digesting noise renders
it operable as a material for the ongoing renewal of the system.

95

<-----Page 109----->Meaning in Autopoietic Thinking
In autopoietic thinking an observer builds his understanding or meanings of
the world through his own communicational and cognitive distinctions.
Because of their autopoietic character, communication and cognition are
separate, self-referential and closed systems, but due to interpenetration
they are able to indirectly affect one another. An observer’s meaningprocessing occurs communicatively and cognitively in social, temporal and
factual dimensions. Social systems are not made up of people, but consist of
communication as the synthesis of the differentiation among information,
utterance and understanding. Media are specific forms of social coordination – without them the evolution of communication would have been
impossible. Because form and media are bound to time, only one type of
medium primarily (but not exclusively) linkd with each stage of social
evolution: oral languages correspond to segmented societies; mass media to
stratified societies, and generalised symbolic media to functionally
differentiated societies.
For Luhmann, modern society is a world society. It consists of functionally
differentiated autopoietic subsystems, which are specialised, fulfilling one
and only one function for society. The more complex a modern society
becomes, the more it depends on a high level of efficiency and
specialisation achieved in each system. The subsystems operate according
to their own form, medium, code and programmes. For example, the
medium of politics is power and for economy it is money. Codes are the
abstract and universally applicable distinctions between positive and
negative values – for example government/opposition (politics) and
have/not have (money) – which allow systems to give meaning to their
environment. Programmes are systems’ operations, which are based on
systems’ coded meaning to the environment (for example a government
platform).

96

<-----Page 110----->The development of advanced systems theory must also have some
influence on the Luhmannian concepts of trust and confidence. We can no
longer be satisfied with Luhmann’s division between confidence in the
system and trust in persons, which he saw as different attitudes with respect
to alternatives but which, despite this, may influence each other. From the
perspective of advanced systems theory, these ‘early-Luhmannian’ concepts
of trust and confidence seem to be too simplistic. However, before turning
in greater depth to the advanced concepts of trust and confidence, I shall
make an excursion into some of the critical debates on Luhmann’s
advanced systems theory. This is because Luhmann’s peculiar theory has
not always received a warm reception but has been accused of eclecticism
and conservatism.

Debates on Systems Theory: An Excursion
In the course of the years there have been many critical debates on
Luhmann’s systems theory. The purpose of this chapter is not so much to
defend Luhmann against his critics. Rather, I will overview some basic
themes and well-known representatives of the critical debate on Luhmann’s
general systems theory. Most of these debates refer to the following themes
or their variations (see King & Thornhill 2003, 203-220):
1. Luhmanns eclecticism and multi-conceptual nature of his theory.
2. Luhmann’s failure to demonstrate empirically that his theory
contributes to the sociological analysis of contemporary society.
3. Luhmann’s failure to account for human agency in directing change
through society.
4. The failure of Luhmann’s ideas to offer anything more than a new brand
of conservatism.
There are also other types of debates, but these four themes (especially the
two latter ones) are extensively exercised by Jürgen Habermas. As a matter
of fact, the condemnation that Luhmann’s theory fails to address
intersubjective ethical issues came originally from Habermas. He invited
97

<-----Page 111----->Luhmann to discuss ‘social technology’ and ‘theory of society’ with him.
As a result of this invitation, Habermas and Luhmann held a joint seminar
at the beginning of the 1970s at the Max Planck Institut in Starnberng. This
resulted in a co-authored book, Theorie der Gesellschaft oder
Sozialtehcnologie: Was leistet die Systemforschung? (1971), which can be
regarded as a starting point for their life-long scientific debate. Habermas
has argued that the deficiency of Luhmann’s theory effectively disqualifies
autopoiesis from consideration as a social theory capable of making general
statements about meaning and validity and, therefore, renders it of limited
value and applicability (Habermas 1987).
Some of the most typical recent critical debates on Luhmann’s theory are
the writings of Ulrich Beck (1988; Beck et al. 1994) and John Mingers’
article Can Social Systems be autopoietic? Assessing Luhmann's social
theory (2002). Beck is extremely critical of Luhmann. For example, he
describes Luhmann’s thought as an “extreme counter-position” to the
“challenges of democracy” (Beck 1988, 166). Mingers in turn carries on
Habermas’ work, in a way, because his critique also culminates to
condemning social autopoiesis for failing to give sufficient importance to
the role played by ‘human activity’ and thereby offering “an incredibly
abstract and reductive view of the social world” (Mingers 2002, 292). I
shall consider Habermas’, Beck’s and Mingers’ critiques each in turn.
Different Communications and Deviant Political Preferences
One good example of the disagreements between Luhmann and Habermas
concerns communication. It has a prominent position in both theorists’
work but is conceived of in a totally different way. Moreover, where
Habermas’ work sees universal principles, Luhmann’s theory only sees
principles that are self-referential, that is, principles that are, paradoxically,
based on themselves (Arnoldi 2001, 2). There is no question that most of
this dispute was highly political. It is obvious that Luhmann’s work is very
far from being the type of critical theory developed by Habermas.
98

<-----Page 112----->Luhmann’s work has rather been described as conservative. Rather than
explicating further the political influences of and differences between
Habermas and Luhmann, however, the purposes of this work are better
served by concentrating on the differences between their concepts of
communication.
In Habermas’ theory of communication, individuals as ‘full’ persons
communicate within a horizon of a ‘lifeworld’36 of shared beliefs and
meanings. Therefore, it stands to reason that Habermas does not ‘swallow’
Luhmann’s separation between consciousness and communication. The
isolation of the individual identity is central to Habermas’s philosophical
critique. As Habermas (1987, 387) formulates:
The flow of official documents among administrative authorities and the
monadically encapsulated consciousness of a Robinson Crusoe provide the
guiding images for the conceptual uncoupling of the social and psychic
systems, according to which the one is supposedly based solely on
communication and the other solely on consciousness. In this abstract
separation of psychic and social systems, a legacy of the philosophy of the
subject makes itself felt: The system-environment relationship affords just
as little conceptual connection with the genuinely linguistic
intersubjectivity proper to agreement and communicatively shared meaning
as did the subject-object relationship.
For Habermas, language offers a solution for the problem of the contact
between consciousness and communication. He proposes language as the
36
It must be noted here that in The Theory of Communicative Action vol. 1 and 2 (1984;
1987b), Habermas combined the theoretical resources of action theory and systems theory
in a dual-perspective conception of society as both lifeworld and system. ‘Lifeworld’ is
constituted by communicative action in the medium of ordinary language, and ‘systems’are
steered by ‘special codes’ such as money and power. Persons act as communicators and
systems exist as anonymous entities “which obey only the logic of efficience and
instrumental reason” (Flynn 2004, 438). While The Theory of Communicative Action
focused on aspects of the ‘colonisation of the lifeworld’ by the systems, Habermas’ later
book, Between Facts and Norms (1996), depicts a way in which the normative resources of
the lifeworld, through the medium of law, can be marshalled to effectively contend with
money and power. According to Habermas, law acts as a ‘transformer’, taking the
normative messages of ordinary language and translating them into the ‘complex legal
code’ which, while open to normative reasons, can also communicate with the functional
steering media of money and power. While Habermas had earlier claimed that the most we
could hope for was a democratic dam against the colonising encroachment of system
imperatives on areas of the lifeworld, in Between Facts and Norms the function of law
goes beyond that. (See Habermas 1996; Flynn 2004.)

99

<-----Page 113----->medium of communication that allows us to relate human individuation and
inter-human socialisation specifically and systemically. Luhmann, as noted
above, also defines language as a medium of communication but underlines
the hypothesis that the individual and his/her ‘uncommunicated’ life are left
outside the social system. In contrast to Luhmann, Habermas argues that
language has a suprasubjective status as prior to subjects, and thus it cannot
be grasped as a consciousness-separated medium.
Suprasubjective linguistic structures would entwine society and individual
too tightly with one another. An intersubjectivity of mutual understanding
among agents and criticizable validity claims would be too strong a tie
between psychic and social systems as well as between different psychic
systems. (Habermas 1987, 379.)
Habermas thus assumes that because of suprasubjective linguistic
structures, common language is a ‘given’. It can be divided into 1) the
‘natural’, which provides the mediation between nature and culture, and 2)
the ‘cultural’ which is rooted in community life. Common language can be
seen as the integrating operation of the social system. (See Leydesdorff
2000.) In other words, common language is the element through which
consciousness and communication combine with one another as well as
with society.
To put it briefly, the first mainline of Habermas’ critique thus concentrates
on the disappearance of the individual and Luhmann’s communication
theory. He says that Luhmann has replaced subject-centred reason by
systems rationality, and his theory is not sociological in its real essence.
Systems theory penetrates into the lifeworld and tries to – using
Habermasian language – encroach to the domain of the lifeworld as well as
erode its communicative solidarity and competence. As Habermas (1987,
383-384) puts it:
[Contrary to the self-understanding of Luhmann], this systems theory is not
suited to the comparatively modest format of a theory that is ‘universal’
only in the specialized sense of being tailored to one discipline. It is not
100

<-----Page 114----->really sociology, but more like those metatheoretical projects that fill the
function of world views.
The second mainline of Habermas’ critique is closely connected to his
political opinions. Theoretical relations between Habermas and Luhmann
became publicly strained in the 1970s and 1980s, when Habermas turned on
Luhmann, vaguely accusing him of direct complicity with the
neoconservative movements gaining influence in Germany during the time
(see Habermas 1985, 181). Luhmann responded in kind by ridiculing the
theoretical naivety of Habermas’ state-society model and by rejecting his
consensual, radical-democratic interpretation of political legitimacy
(Luhmann 1996c, 71; see also King & Thornhill 2003, 165).
The reciprocal ‘taunting’ between these two lasted in one form or another
until Luhmann’s death. It was Luhmann’s firm belief that Habermas’
critical theory was a nostalgic, morally motivated rhetorical stance, an
ethos, rather than a well-thought-out theory adequate to the task of
understanding modern society. When asked where the answers to
modernity’s most perplexing questions were to be found, Luhmann’s
answer was an emphatic: “Not in Frankfurt” (Luhmann 2002b, 193; see
also Rasch 2002, 30).
Luhmann as ‘the Warden of a Castle’
The most outspoken, even furious, recent critique against Luhmann is
presented by Ulrich Beck. In his book Gegengifte: Die organisierte
Unverantwortlichkeit (1988), Beck attacks Luhmann’s theory of evolution
and systems rationality in particular. Beck (1988, 167) compares
Luhmann’s systems theory to a ‘castle’ which is empty of people. In such a
castle there no longer is any complaining, suspicion, causes of contention,
death, hatred, love or accusations. Such a castle brings out its own
perfection. “Through voice of the only living warden of this castle
(Schlossverwalter) – Niklas Luhmann – people become aware of, how
101

<-----Page 115----->frighteningly unnecessary and unreal they have become from the system’s
point of view” (Beck 1988, 167).
Beck also does not agree with Luhmann’s concept of danger. Beck
interprets that in Luhmann’s theory of society, dangers can be perceived
only selectively and they can hardly be handled at all. Therefore, there are
no dangers in the societal sense. Following Beck’s interpretation, speaking
of general dangers (for example ecological danger) is, for Luhmann, only a
rhetoric of fear (Angst-Rhetorik). It is moralising, which is morally
rejectable because moralising belongs to the Old-European thinking. (Beck
1988, 169-170.)
According to Beck (1988, 171), Luhmann ought to give up the idea of
systems rationality. He should not paint a harmonic picture of a functionally
differentiated society. By doing so, Luhmann is on the side of the
establishment. Luhmann also puts aside the fact that dangerous situations
demonstrate the mixture of nature and society in which nature has become
dependent of society and vice versa.
Luhmann’s books Ökologische Kommunikation (1986) and Soziologie des
Risikos (1991) were clearly reactions to Beck’s Risikogesellschaft (1986)
and Gegengifte (1988). In the latter, Luhmann widely theoretised the
differences between risk and danger – most likely in part because of Beck’s
critique. The influence of Beck seems to have had the effect of dragging
Luhmann down from the systems-theoretical ‘castle’ and motivating him to
confront head-on current social issues. Nonetheless, Luhmann does not
relinguish his systems-theoretical thinking. Nor does he share Beck’s
dystopian vision of the destructive effects of scientific and technological
rationality, and the domination of politics by technological considerations.
Furthermore, Beck’s seeming faith in the Green movement and mass
participation in decisions concerning the future of the society contrasts
markedly with Luhmann’s total scepticism concerning social movements,
protest and the politics of participation. Luhmann regards Beck’s visions as
102

<-----Page 116----->over-idealistic or utopic solutions to the problems of world society. From
Beck’s perspective, it can be said that Luhmann holds his position on the
side of the establishment and still remains the only living warden in the
‘castle’.37
Communication cannot be Autopoietic
Luhmann’s systems theory has also been under fire of criticism during the
last couple of years. John Mingers’ critique primarily seeks “to evaluate the
possibility that social systems could be autopoietic” (Mingers 2002, 276).
However, Mingers is not as radical in his critique as Beck. He describes the
original biological theory of autopoiesis which postulates a circular system
of production recursively reproducing its own elements from its own
elements and he considers in general terms the problems of translating this
meaningfully into sociological categories. Mingers (2002, 283) comes to
the conclusion that: “Overall, it seems difficult to sustain the idea that
social systems are autopoietic, at least in strict accordance with the formal
definition”. Mingers thus bases his objection to the sociological use of
autopoiesis. He claims that only physical systems are truly able to

37
Somehow it seems that in his recent writings Beck has appropriated many Luhmannian
ideas. At least, he does not take an equally negative stance against Luhmann as in the
1980s. Let me give some examples. If Luhmann insisted that there can be only one society,
the world society, Beck, in turn, speaks of a world risk society (1996; 1999) or the
cosmopolitan society (1996; 2000). Furthermore, Beck’s concept of subpolitics – which
can be conceptualised as a form of politics “outside and beyond the representative
institutions of the political system of nation-states” (Beck 1996, 18) – can be argued to
certain extent to have similar characteristics with Luhmann’s idea of the differentiation of
functional subsystems. If Luhmann speaks about the differentiation of political system,
Beck associates the rise of subpolitics with a loss of functionality in the political system.
This implies that functions hitherto associated with politics are now taken over – not by
other subsystems – but by other agencies such as NGOs, corporations or science (see Beck
1986, 307, see also Holzer and Sörensen 2003, 79-102). Beck’s concept of subject has also
been complemented with some Luhmannian elements. What Beck often omits is that an
individual must choose fast, must – as by reflex – make quick decisions. Luhmann also
stresses the importance of selections and decisions (especially in the communication
process). Following Beck, individuals are forced to live in an atmosphere of risk in which
knowledge and life-chances are precarious. This type of “subject is so constantly in motion
that it makes little sense to talk about a subject-position” (Beck et al. 2003, 23.) This type
of individual can no longer be conceived of as a stable and unchangeable subject, but
rather as a ‘quasi-subject’, the result as well as the producer of its networks, situation,
location and form. Following this conclusion, it seems that Beck is already very close to
Luhmann, who insists that we can never be in the society ‘as whole persons’.

103

<-----Page 117----->reproduce themselves as elements of themselves, and consequently that the
term ‘autopoiesis’ is misused when applied, for instance by social theories,
to non-physical entities. From Mingers’ point of view, communication
cannot be autopoietic because it is a non-physical entity.
King and Thornhill (2003b, 278) have argued that Mingers’ account is
“misleading in certain key respects and, as a consequence, his subsequent
critical evaluation involves a misunderstanding of Luhmann’s sociology
and a failure to appreciate the overriding objective that Luhmann set
himself in his theoretical work.” King and Thornhill want to remind us that
Luhmann did not attempt a simple transfer of autopoiesis from nature to
abstract systems, from the biological to the social. Luhmann had already set
out in considerable detail a theory of closed social systems well before he
became acquainted with the concept of autopoiesis and, moreover, the main
components of this theory remained virtually unchanged in his postautopoiesis works. Mingers is thus also wrong in saying that Luhmann’s
failure to give sufficient importance to human agency is related in any way
to his alleged misuse of the concept of autopoiesis, since Luhmann’s denial
of the central place of the individual was already an important feature of his
earlier, pre-autopoiesis theoretical scheme (see Luhmann1976; 1977).
Mingers (2002, 288-290) suggests that ‘persons’ “can trigger…society and
society may then generate a communication” and “a communication opens
up possibilities through its meaning to people whose selections then
generate new communications.” Mingers thus suggests that for society and
its subsystems, ‘persons’ exist outside communications.

From a

Luhmannian point of view, this sounds irrational. ‘Persons’ do exist in the
form of ‘the public’, ‘individuals’, ‘reasonable men’, and ‘rational beings’,
the subjects of experiments, clients or patients, or as a part of the
environment for social subsystems, such as politics, science or economics,
but always as constructions of the system that communicates about them.
(King & Thornhill 2003b, 280.) As said before, ‘persons’ have a role in
producing and reproducing communications. They can be seen as ‘carriers
104

<-----Page 118----->of communication’, forming a common ground for the operations of
different systems, and suppliers of the basis for inter-systemic
communication.
Mingers evidently continues Habermas’ critique against Luhmann. Namely
Mingers, appears to import the Habermasian concepts of ‘lifeworld’ and
‘the general communications of the lifeworld’ into Luhmann’s theory, to
which these concepts are almost totally foreign. Moreover, Luhmann’s
writings contain several ironic references to Habermas and his idealistic
view that society exists beyond the boundaries of its own subsystems.
Luhmann separates the concepts of subsystemic communication and simple
interaction, from which the latter can be regarded inherent to a model of
‘the lifeworld’ and, in this type of situation, is not yet recognised by
subsystemic communications systems.
Informal exchanges between ‘people’ may well exist, but Luhmann regards
these exchanges as products of the social system of interaction and labels
this type of interaction systems simple social systems. These systems are
undifferentiated (contrary to subsystems) and do not enfurther internal
system formation: for example, interaction systems with face-to-face
contact. As Luhmann (1995, 193) notes:
Internal differentiation is not a requirement of system formation. In fact,
there are completely undifferentiated systems that do not admit further
internal system formation: for example, interaction systems with face-toface contact. We will term them simple social systems. Not all, but many
interaction systems with face-to-face contact are simple social systems in
this sense.
However, as soon as interaction systems are recognised by societal
subsystems as having the quality of internally differentiated communication
(Luhmann 1987b, 114), they become parts of society such as economics (in
the form of payments), politics (in the form of public opinion) or law (in the
form of evidence). This is not a matter of course but “interaction systems
105

<-----Page 119----->can consolidate enduring subsystems internally only with great effort”
(Luhmann 1995, 193).
To conclude, Habermas, Mingers and especially Beck cannot accept
Luhmann’s way of theorising society as an autopoietic social system. These
debates employ different conceptions of society, communication, the role of
individual, language, interaction and the use of autopoiesis from those of
Luhmann. Habermas, Beck and Mingers are not of course alone with their
critical opinions about Luhmann’s theory. Frederic Vanderberghe (1999)
has complained that Luhmann’s theory is pitched at such a high level of
abstraction and reflexivity that it is often hard to see its relevance, even to
those who are used to more metaphysical bedtime reading. Parallel to
Vanderberghe, Hans-Herbert Kögler (1997, 271) has noted that
“Luhmann’s ‘flight above the clouds’ is in conceptual abstraction
comparable to Spinoza's Ethics, Hegel's Logic or Foucault's Archeology of
Knowledge”. Moreover, Hans Joas (1996, 213) dismissively compares
Luhmann’s work to the “theatre of the absurd” or to “romantic irony”.
As noted above, in autopoietic thinking an observer builds his
understanding or meanings of the world through his own communicational
and cognitive distinctions. An observer’s meaning-process occurs
communicatively and cognitively in social, temporal and factual
dimensions. In his advanced systems theory, Luhmann also emphasises the
role of media, which are specific forms of social co-ordination, without
which the evolution of communication would have been impossible.
Moreover, he argues that we are affected by functionally differentiated
autopoietic subsystems, which operate according to theiry own form,
medium, code and programmes. Considering, then, the problematics of trust
from the point of view of autopoietic systems theory, I would like to
conclude that the character of the Luhmannian trust might also have been
changed during the evolution of the media and differentiation of autopoietic
subsystems. In other words, in the next chapters I will discuss the concepts
of trust and confidence – in a way that Luhmann himself did not do – in the
106

<-----Page 120----->context of advanced systems theory. Are there any familiar forms of trust
left, which can be traced back to former societies? If society does not
consist of people but of communication, it is not relevant to follow Parsons
and Simmel whose main question with regard to trust was who to trust. Nor
is it fruitful to be satisfied with Luhmann’s ‘early’ division between trust in
persons and confidence in systems. Rather, we should ask how the ideas of
autopoiesis, interpenetration and three-part communication, evolution and
differentiation have affected the problematics of trust in modern society.
How can we trust different subsystems and their codes and programmes?
On the whole, how does trust function in the context of advanced systems
theory?

107

<-----Page 121----->5. Familiarity, Trust and Confidence in the Context
of Advanced Systems Theory
In the 1960s when Luhmann wrote Vertrauen, he had not yet developed his
threefold concept of communication, which later became one of the most
important starting points for his advanced (autopoietic) systems theory. In
those days Luhmann still followed the ‘Old-European’ notion that
individuals participate in a society as whole human beings. In the case of
trust, at least, systems function only as ‘allies’ of individuals. As Luhmann
(1979, 93) puts it:
Systems are rational to the extent that they can encompass and reduce
complexity, and this they can only do if they possess understanding of how
to make use of trust and distrust without placing too heavy demands on the
person who finally shows trust or distrust: the individual.
At this point Luhmann has neither adopted the idea of autopoiesis nor
problematised the self-referential character of psychic (thoughts) and social
(communication) systems and the possible intepenetrations between them.
Nevertheless, already in Vertrauen Luhmann was convinced that there must
be some difference between personal and social systems. This difference
also has to do with trust.
Trust rests on illusion. In actuality, there is less information available than
would be required to give assurance of success. The actor willingly
surmounts this deficit information…Problematical aspects are partially
shifted from the outside to the inside, and dealt with through internal
modalities of learning and of symbolic control. This ways of
conceptualizing the matter can be rendered in abstract terms by making use
of general systems theory, which claims to be valid both for personal and
social action systems. (Luhmann 1979, 32.)
In the context of advanced systems theory, trust can no longer work in this
way. Because of autopoiesis, problematic aspects cannot be directly shifted
from the outside (environment) to the inside (system) or vice versa. As we
have seen, Luhmann separates psychic and social systems. Social systems
108

<-----Page 122----->observe via communication, while conscious systems (consciousness or the
thoughts of a human being) observe via cognition. There is some
interpenetration between these systems, but as said before, only thoughts
reproduce thougths and communication reproduces communication. This is
important when we examine the problems of trust in the context of
advanced systems theory. Trust is not identical in the social and psychic
systems. Because they are autopoietic, there must also be two meanings for
trust; a cognitive one and a communicative one.

Familiarity as Part of Simple Interaction
Before addressing in greater depth problematics of the advanced
Luhmannian concepts of trust and confidence, it is necessary to consider the
role of familiarity in the context of advanced systems theory. It can indeed
be said that familiarity can still be seen as a precondition for trust and
confidence. It is also true that living in a completely familiar world is no
longer possible and, thus, trust and confidence are the decisive issues.
Considering, then, familiarity from the point of view of advanced systems
theory, it can be said that all that is familiar for people can be seen as parts
of their lifeworlds. Luhmann himself also mentions en passant about the
connection between familiarity and lifeworld in Familiarity, Confidence
and Trust (1988, 95): “We can live within a familiar world because we can,
using symbols, reintroduce the unfamiliar into the familiar. We never have
to leave the familiar world. It remains our lifeworld.”
Viewing this from the perspective of advanced systems theory, lifeworld
consists of interaction. Many systems of interactions, for Luhmann, are
confined to exchanges between people who are present (face-to-face
contact). According to Luhmann (1995, 193), these types of interaction
systems are simple social systems. This type of interaction consists of
informal exchange between people, whether concerning the weather, the
performance of politicians or last night’s television programmes. However,
in Luhmannian terms such exchange is the type of communication which is
109

<-----Page 123----->not (as of yet) recognised at the level of communicative subsystems
(Luhmann 1995, 416-417). It seems obvious that this kind of familiar
interaction is not connected to complexity and risks. Familiarity does not
contain any other possibilities; complexity is reduced at the outset. In the
familiar world we use only the familiar distinctions between the familiar
and the unfamiliar (Luhmann 1988, 96). Commitment to familiarity can
simplify the world and render it harmless. “One can assume that the
familiar will remain, that the trustworthy will stand the test once more and
that the familiar world will continue into the future” (Luhmann 1979, 20).
In short, in the context of advanced systems theory, familiarity can be
connected to the past and lived life as well as to the systems of simple
interaction.

Figure 6. Familiarity and interaction in lifeworld.
Familiarity has not disappeared anywhere. We still use familiar symbols,
norms and habits, and live in a familiar world (see Figure 6). On the other
hand, we cannot live in a fully familiar world because we meet new things
and people every day. From Luhmann’s evolutionary point of view, it was
the invention of writing, literacy, and in particular the printing press (later
also the mass media and internet) that changed the conditions of familiarity.
Familiarity survives today primarily in a purely private milieu. This is
because “technicalization forgets the ‘lifeworld’” (Luhmann 2002b, 68).
However, familiarity has a function; it functions as a precondition for trust
and confidence. Familiarity belongs to simple interaction systems but can
110

<-----Page 124----->be said to play only a minor role in the functional subsystems. Following
advanced systems theory, there is (a double contingent) interaction between
(at least) two ‘persons’ or psychic systems. Simple interaction between
psychic systems also consists of three-part communication (i.e. information,
utterance and understanding), but it can be said that there is less need for
selections in this type of communication than in the type of communication
within the area of functional subsystems. Therefore, this type of
communication within the system of simple interaction is not necessarily
very complex and does not yet have any linkage with risks.

Trust as Communication
From an advanced systems-theoretical point of view, it is still the growing
complexity of society what makes trust so necessary to us. Trust is also still
a risky investment. To trust is to take a risk. However, deviating from the
‘early’ Luhmannian theory of trust, it cannot be said human beings would
be capable of directing complexity. If society consists only of
communication, it is thus communication that is capable of directing
complexity. Furthermore, because individuals can be seen as ‘carriers of
communication’, it is not enough to say – like Luhmann did – that trust is
needed primarily in interpersonal relations. In the context of advanced
systems theory, trust has to do with communication and not necessarily
with ‘full persons’ because ‘persons’, in Luhmann’s scheme, exist both as
biological or living systems and as psychic systems, but in the context of
social systems they can be seen as communicative constructions. Trust must
be expressed in some way. In the context of advanced systems theory, it can
be expressed only via communication.
Trust can still be seen as a decision. Deviating from ‘early’ Luhmann, the
advanced concept of decision cannot be connected to psychic or internal
systems. “Decision is not understood as a psychological mechanism, but as
a matter of communication, not as a psychological event in the form of an
internally conscious definition of the self, but as a social event” (Luhmann
111

<-----Page 125----->2003, 32). In short, the advanced decision is communication. Decisionmaking is a form of communication that limits contingency. If one decides
to trust, he is also able to reduce or reconstruct complexity, but he cannot
eliminate it. If we follow ’early’ Luhmann in understanding trust as a
decision, and apply this to the context of advanced systems theory, where
decisions are communications, it follows that trust must be communication,
and thus an element of social systems or programs, interaction and
organisations.
As said above, familiarity is a precondition for trust in the advanced
systems-theoretical approach as well. But deviating from the familiar type
of interaction, trust is, in this context, needed on the level of subsystemic
communication. I would argue that by trusting (or distrusting) we are
moving from the communicative level of simple interaction (life-world or
simple social system) to the communicative level of functional subsystems
(world of risks and complex systems). Therefore, it can be said that trust
requires subsystemic interaction wherein codes play a major role. If trust
concretises itself socially in communication, it is then a decision that
reduces the complexity of the subsystems. Yet trust is not a medium of the
subsystems and, for this reason, it does not have a binary code. It can be
seen as a program which complements subsystems’ coding, filling it with
content. This means that a truster communicates with some media (money,
power, law etc.) and must take a risk. He is incapable of avoiding risks in
terms of money or power, but has to trust. The decision to trust becomes
evident as a program which builds on the four conditions: mutuality, the
rule of situation, trust can only be offered and accepted, and it has to be
earned. In any event, trust as a program does not determine the nature of the
coding; rather, it is the code which generates the program of trust and gives
it an appearance of rationality. It can be said that trust as a program is only
part of the coded program, which realises and complements the subsystems’
coding. The code is rigid and invariant, but trust as a program is flexible
and has to be renewed. Therefore, neither trust nor distrust is feasible as a
112

<-----Page 126----->universal attitude. Only codes are universal. This non-universal character of
trust was already noticed by ‘early’ Luhmann (1979, 72):
[Universality of trust or distrust] would be either too risky or too great
burden. Both positions presuppose that one is conscious of the possible
behaviour of others as a specific problem. One trusts if one assumes that
this behaviour of others as a specific problem; one distrusts if one reckons
that this will not be the case.
These types of trust relations do not follow directly from previous
prescriptions, but are always future-oriented, and thus cannot only be part
of familiarity or a system of simple interaction. The decision to trust is thus
closely connected with time, especially with the future. This is because in
the modern world, “present time” is “pregnant with future” (Luhmann
2002, 92). Furthermore, what really cannot be demanded but only offered,
must also be something that exists beyond normative or moral definitions.
Communicative trust always presupposes a situation of risk because it is
possible for others to abuse the offered trust. This is tightly connected to the
fact that in reflexive and complex societies morality plays only a peripheral
role, and is itself a problematic concept (see more Luhmann 1996), as well
as the fact that we cannot know the thoughts of the other. As Luhmann
(1995, 2) puts it:
For societies that are becoming more complex, a global programming of the
social dimension in the form of morality becomes increasingly inadequate:
in part because morality’s zones of tolerance must be overextended, in part
because everything excluded must be morally discredited – and practically
because both occur together and morality is thereby pluralized.
Trust is necessary in modern society. Conceived in a systems theoretical
way, its central features are contingency and double contingency.
“Contingency leads to modalised horizon rules which again means that
more possibilities are expected, or perhaps that even the unexpected is
expected” (Arnoldi 2003, 407). Participants are living in conditions of
double contingency; they are opaque and incalculable to one another. Risk,
of course, is a consequence of contingency and double contingency, or of
113

<-----Page 127----->not knowing what to expect, especially in terms of causation. Contingency
and double contingency are tied closely to the fact that the decision to trust
is a choice between two alternatives; he who chooses to trust could always
have preferred not to do so. If there were any secure knowledge about how
to decide, there would not be a situation of choice, or a need for trust. “To
have the choice means not to know what to do” (Nassehi 2005, 10). From
these standpoints, we might even say that trust seems to be a necessary
element with which it is at least possible to begin solving the problems of
contingency, double contingency, choice and causation.38
To conclude, trust is possible in the advanced systems-theoretical context
only via communication. The interest that has effect beyond this kind of
communication is in the reduction of the complexity of society.
Communicative trust, then, is only formed where it is needed. ‘Persons’
have to decide that they need to trust in order to be able to manage the risks.
They have to be open and mutually oriented, and also stay clear of
disagreements and conflicts, but not of risks.

Confidence as a Part of Psychic Systems
If trust is a part of communication, where, then, does confidence (which, is
a cognitive, rather than communicative process) belong in advanced
systems theory? Confidence is not mutual but is placed in the functions of

38
Jacob Arnoldi examines the problem of causation in the Luhmannian context. After
reading his article Making Sense of Causation (2003), I became convinced that there must
be some link between the modern problems of causation and trust. Arnoldi’s conclusion
about the future is quite shocking: The recent changes “are part of a more general cultural
development in common sense representations of the world…That development is a
development towards more modalized expectations, with fewer taken for granted causal
relations, with more awareness of contingency and side effects, and with less belief in
human mastery and regulation of causal processes.” (Arnoldi 2003, 425.) If the future
seems modal as described above, the role of trust is essential. If there are only few matterof-fact causal relations and increased awareness of contingency and side effects, the
amount of risk and uncertainty grows as well, as does, most importantly, the need for trust.
However, it must be noted that if we follow Arnoldi’s thinking, there is a danger that we
forget the importance of familiarity and simple interaction, which – although the future
would be modal as described above – will function as preconditions for trust.

114

<-----Page 128----->systems. It can be said, following Luhmann, that confidence still depends
on inherent danger but not always risk. Where trust involves
communication between (at least) two communicative actors, who are
observers of social systems, then confidence, in turn, is an element of
psychic systems. Confidence builds up largely on the level of thoughts. It
lives in our minds and does not travel in our communication like trust. That
is to say, only observers of psychic systems, not observers of
communicative systems (i.e. communicative actors), could have or build
confidence.
For example, you may meet something dangerous in the streets and you
decide to take a weapon with you next time you leave the house. In this
case, you do not have enough confidence in the police. What happens is
that your attitude to police and street violence has changed and you have
reacted to this psychically as well as externally (you are now carrying the
weapon). This has directly nothing to do with trust and communication; it is
a psychic process of adaptation, a change in the state of confidence in a
psychic system.
Confidence can be seen as a by-product of socialisation and the history of a
person. It seems that the advanced concept of confidence has many of the
same qualities as Parsons’ concept of trust. What Parsons calls trust, and
what I, following advanced systems theory have, called confidence, is
something that has to be learned? As a matter of fact, it seems that there is
not much difference between confidence and familiarity. If anything,
confidence emerges in the situations characterised by contingency and
danger, but familiarity always ‘stays’ in the familiar lifeworld.
In addition to being an element of psychic systems, confidence also has to
act as a kind of background ‘noise’ for social systems or trust. Therefore,
confidence also affects, or interpenetrates, indirectly the actor’s abilities to
trust, or at least, facilitates his willingness to decide to have trust in
situations.
115

<-----Page 129----->However, confidence cannot be only an element of psychic systems or
some kind of background ‘noise’of trust. The confidence we have in the
functions (or coded communication) of systems or organisations has to be
expressed some way. In other words, there can be general confidence in the
educational system, the validity of the sanctions of the legal system or the
power relations of the political system. For example, our confidence in the
function of politics might increase or decrease. Despite this, we do not
necessarily have a direct contact with politicians to whom we can tell this.
Nonetheless, confidence can be socialised, for example through the media
of subsystems (power, money, law etc.), mass media, opinion polls and
elections. Therefore, although confidence can, on the one hand, be
connected to consciousness, it is not, on the other hand, an element of
psychic systems alone. It can be socialised and thus also become general in
many ways. There can be confidence, which is an element of psychic
systems but, in addition to this, there has to be another type of confidence,
which can be called socialised confidence.
It must be noted that because this type of confidence takes effect on the
level of thoughts, it is difficult to control socially. This fact is also noticed
by ‘early’ Luhmann (1979, 50) when he stresses the fact that system trust is
more difficult to control but easier to learn than personal trust. However,
during that time Luhmann did not yet operate with the advanced concepts
of psychic and social systems. In the context of advanced theory this means
that we cannot control other actors’ confidence because we are unable to
know the real thoughts of the other. Human beings and their thoughts are
freer than communication and trust because communication is perceivable.
Confidence might remain invisible and it is exactly this invisibility that
makes it so difficult to control. However, the situation is different if
confidence is socialised in the forms of opinion polls or elections;
confidence becomes visible and controllable after it has been socialised in
the form of communication.

116

<-----Page 130----->Connections between Trust and Confidence
As said above, confidence is not only some kind of background ‘noise’ of
social systems or trust; there can also be other connections between trust
and confidence. It looks quite evident that in autopoietic thinking,
confidence no longer needs trust as an input condition like Luhmann (1988,
103) insisted in Familiarity, Confidence and Trust. Because of their
autopoietic character, they cannot have any direct contact. Moreover,
Luhmann’s (1988, 102) argument, which stresses that “trust remains vital in
interpersonal relations, but participation in functional systems like the
economy or politics…requires confidence”, is no longer relevant in the
advanced systems-theoretical context. If we want to stress the
‘interpersonal’ relations, in advanced systems theoretical language it means
that we emphasise communication. Therefore, from society’s point of view
trust is still important, because it is trust that can be in society, because trust
is communication and observable. Participation in functional subsystems
might require confidence. This type of confidence is directed to the
functions and representatives of the systems, and concretises itself – or
makes itself observable – through the media of subsystems (power, money,
law etc.) or some other ways, like through mass media, opionion polls and
elections (which I will study more specifically in chapter seven). As said
before, confidence is part of our thoughts and as such remains
unobservable. However, after it has been socialised, it becomes visible and
part of communication.
The importance of confidence, thus, has not disappeared. Because of
socialised confidence, it can also be said that confidence might be part of
communication. Confidence can be expressed communicatively through
opinion polls or mass media, and thus it indirectly affects our willingness to
trust. Therefore, unlike ‘early’ Luhmann, I would say that confidence (or
system trust) can become an open matter for public discussion. As noted
above, behind confidence, there functions a tactical and supportive
perspective, and it could also bring some relief to the situation of trust.
117

<-----Page 131----->Without these qualities of confidence, then, it would be impossible to trust
anybody. We also have to remember that trust is part of communication
(social systems) and confidence is part of thoughts (psychic systems). Thus,
there must be a temporal connection and congruence between them.
Because trust is a decision which socialises itself in social systems
(communication) and confidence is part of psychic systems (thoughts), it is
obvious that confidence affects the ways we construct trust. Similarly, the
offered trust affects our confidential thinking. Trust therefore needs
confidence and confidence also needs trust, but there cannot be a direct
contact between them. In other words, there is interpenetration between
confidence and trust. Through interpenetration it is also easier to understand
how trust and confidence depend on each other to produce themselves, as
well as why the meanings of trust and confidence must be employed on
such a high theoretical level.

<-----Page 132----->In Figure 7 I have illustrated the functional operations of trust and
confidence in the context of advanced systems theory. Familiarity can be
seen as a precondition for confidence as well as trust. It is a part of simple
interaction, but does not have a remarkable importance on the level of more
complex communication. Confidence is a part of psychic systems, which,
because of interpenetration, affects the decision to trust. The decision to
trust, however, socialises itself in communication (which consists of three
selections: information, utterance and understanding). Trust is not a
medium of subsystems and it does not have a code. Rather, it is a program
via which risk-taking in different subsystems is possible. This program has
to follow the four bases of trust: mutuality, the rule of situation, the fact that
trust can only be offered and accepted, and finally, that it has to be earned.
The functions of trust are connected to risks, complexity and these four
bases.
However, once confidence has been socialised, it is also a part of
communication and might become general. Here it indirectly affects the
decision to trust. Socialised and communicatively expressed confidence,
just like trust, might also indirectly affect our confidential consciousness.
Having analysed Luhmann’s concept of trust in the context of his advanced
systems theory, I will next move on to examine Giddens’ and Sztompka’s
sociological approaches on trust from the advanced Luhmannian point of
view. As pointed out above, these approaches have been influenced by
Luhmann but at this point it becomes clear that it can be said that Giddens
and Sztompka were influenced only by ‘early’ Luhmann. But if the insights
of advanced systems theory are taken seriously, Giddens’ and Sztompka’s
theories of trust become somewhat problematic. Therefore, in the following
I will analyse the way these approaches deviate from the advanced
Luhmannian theory of trust and why they, in consequence, do not benefit
my further systems-theoretical analyses of trust. In the context of the
problems of Sztompka’s approach, I also touch upon some problems of the
discussion on social capital.
119

<-----Page 133----->Giddens from the Advanced Luhmannian Perspective
There are several common interests in ‘early’ Luhmann’s and Giddens’
conceptions of trust. First, Luhmann and Giddens both aim to show that
trust is conscious action. Second, it is obvious to both that trust also is
based on mutuality. Luhmann talks about mutual commitment, whereas
Giddens emphasises facework commitments. These commitments may be
the most important elements in cases where one wants to build a trust
relationship with another person. There are not any ready-made bonds but
one must work to build them. These bonds are commitments and they are
not created or preserved automatically. Third, trust only exists in relation to
future and risks. According to Luhmann, we do not need trust in the
familiar world, because it is the world of routines. Giddens talks about
gradual detraditionalisation (see Giddens 1994). Well-known facts are
disappearing or at least their nature is changing. People are bound to
choose, become more individualised and, therefore, orient themselves
towards the future and risks.
However, when Luhmann’s conception of trust is placed in the context of
advanced systems theory, these similarities seem problematic. Namely, we
must remember that whilst communication is the motor of society in
Luhmann’s systems theory, for Giddens it is human agency. This is the
primary reason why the advanced Luhmannian and Giddensian conceptions
of trust in persons and trust in systems cannot be said to be similar or
synonymous. The first difference between Giddens and Luhmann is the fact
that Giddens does not extensively analyse the concept of familiarity. It
seems that familiarity, for Giddens, is only an element of premodern
societies. As Giddens (1994, 82) notes:
In premodern societies, the extension of trust to newly encountered
strangers normally takes the form of an extension of the ‘familiar’, either
through ritual encounters or through the uncovering of kin connections. A
person may be trusted, at least provisionally, if some kind of kin relation,
even very remote, is identified.
120

<-----Page 134----->Hence, it seems that for Giddens the concept of familiarity in a (late)
modern or reflexive society is included in trust. From the advanced
Luhmannian point of view, this leads to some contradictions. Giddens
admits that there is no need to trust anyone whose thoughts are transparent,
but at the same time, he emphasises mutuality and intimacy in personal
trust relations. Personal trust is bound to facework commitments, which are
mutual and intimate.
From the advanced Luhmannian perspective, it is self-evident that thoughts
cannot be transparent or observable to the observer. Therefore, ‘fictional
transparent thoughts’ do not entail the disappeareance of the need for trust.
On the contrary, since thoughts are unobservable, the role of double
contingency, and thus the need for trust, is emphasised. Furthermore,
mutuality characterised by integrity and intimacy belongs not only to the
sphere of trust but also of familiarity. These types of relations sometimes
belong to the system of simple interaction and not necessarily to more
complex systems of communication. Therefore, they cannot be systemstheoretically analysed only in terms of trust but must also be approached in
terms of familiarity. From the advanced Luhmannian perspective, then,
facework commitments cannot always be seen as part of personal trust.
They can also be familiar relations, which can be analysed in terms of
systems of simple interaction. Nonetheless, we must admit that they affect
our willingness to trust other persons, and have confidence in abstract
systems. Thus, it seems to follow that if trust cannot be connected to
faceless commitments, it is a ‘homeless’ concept in Giddens’ theory. This is
due to the fact that following advanced Luhmannian theory of trust, there
can be also familiarity in the sphere of facework commitments. From the
advanced Luhmannian perspective, Giddens does not thus analyse the
differences between familiarity and trust extensively enough.
Second, Giddens stresses the role of faceless commitments in the modern
world. In faceless commitments confidence is sustained in the workings of
121

<-----Page 135----->abstract systems or the knowledge of experts. It is evident that we must
have some type of confidence in abstract systems. Yet these commitments
cannot only be linked to the confidence we have in abstract systems or their
representatives (experts, organisation, institutions etc.). In personal trust
relations, too, we must be oriented by the future and affected by double
contingency. If we meet risks and decide to trust, following the decision
everyone can be seen as an expert for the truster. This is because we cannot
know the thoughts of the other (due to double contingency), and are thus
always ‘faceless’ to one another. This analysis makes Giddens’ concept of
trust theoretically even more ‘homeless’. Somehow Giddens seems to admit
this himself by emphasising the importance of confidence in modern
society. Trust as part of confidence – in Giddens’ theory – is nothing more
but a test of confidence through access points (situations where the ignorant
person encounters the expertise system). Perceived in advanced
Luhmannian terms, this has nothing to do with communication and risks.
Third, the homelessness of trust is emphasised if we take a closer look at
the relationship between trust and continuity. For Giddens, trust is a
continuous state which does not have to be renewed. It is only confidence
that must be renewed. Systems-theoretically this means that there is no trust
in society, because it does not have to be renewed or re-produced. In other
words, there are no communicational forms of trust. Trust, in Giddens’
approach, can be perceived as tied to basic trust, the building of which is
started right after we are born, and the trustworthiness and trustfulness of a
child has an effect throughout a person’s life. By characterising trust
through social psychological elements, Giddens makes the basic mistake
Luhmann warns us against: he tries to reduce the social sphere
(communication) to individual psychological variables (consciousness).
Fourth, Giddens rightly points out that we need trust because of risks,
which are situated in the environment. However, Giddens is here caught up
in the same problem with open systems theory, namely that of the
interaction between a system and its environment. Although risks might
122

<-----Page 136----->affect large masses of individuals, the perceptions of risks always remain
different. There is no direct interaction between environmental risk and the
individual (psychic system), but there are as many meanings for risk as
there are observers. Therefore, ‘persons’ must trust and be oriented towards
risks if they want to reduce complexity. It is not our confidence in abstract
systems only that gives us the possibility of reducing complexity and
managing risks. Risks might be produced by abstract systems (function
systems), but if trust comes to play, then the media of systems alone are
unable to manage the risks they have produced. As a consequence, this can
reduce our confidence in the functions of these systems and their media.
From the advanced Luhmannian perspective an acceptance of Giddens’
views on trust equals no trust at all. From this perspective, trust cannot be
part of facework commitments because trust relations are not only
indicators of the integrity or intimacy of others. Trust relations are always
faceless because we cannot know the thoughts of the other, and to trust is to
take a risk, because the trustee can always abuse our trust. Following
Giddens, it seems that in order to able to reduce complexity we must only
have confidence in abstract systems, because risk management is their
‘privilege’. They produce risks, so they have to deal with them. ‘Persons’
are thus unable to take risks and also to trust. They have to have faith in the
goodwill of others in the sphere of facework commitments. Abstract
systems (which Giddens grasps as organisations or institutions rather than
systems) and experts will handle the risks. As Giddens (1990, 89) says:
“Trust is only demanded where there is ignorance.” Ignorance is
concretised via access points, which are “points of connection between lay
individuals or collectivities and the representatives of abstract systems.
They are places of vulnerability for abstract systems, but also junctions at
which trust can be maintained or built up.” (Giddens 1990, 88.) Access
points are Giddensian ‘places’ for trust. In other words, they are the
systems’ testing ‘places’ for psychologically developed trust which, in
advanced Luhmannian language, comes closer to confidence than trust. In
the end, there seem to be only familiar facework commitments and faceless
123

<-----Page 137----->commitments, which rely upon confidence. There is no real trust. Therefore,
Giddens’ approach does not give us enough ingredients for studying the
functions of trust in a modern or functionally differentiated society. Rather,
it gives too simplistic a view of the logic of trust and confidence by
emphasising the importance of abstract systems.

Sztompka from the Advanced Luhmannian Perspective
If we examine Sztompka’s definition of trust and the functions of trust from
an ‘early’ Luhmannian point of view, there appear to be several theoretical
similarities. Sztompka follows Luhmann in his definition, because trust, in
his initial definition, is intensively connected with risk. Furthermore,
Sztompka’s idea of ‘endowed trust’ agrees with Luhmann’s four bases of
personal trust. ‘Endowed trust’ necessitates mutual commitment and ‘the
rule of situation’. Furthermore, endowing others with trust also follows the
rule that it is not possible to demand the trust of others; trust can only be
offered and accepted; trust has to be earned. To put it briefly, on a personal
level the functions of trust – both in Sztompka’s and Luhmann’s analysis –
are aimed at managing risks or reducing complexity.
But when we take the advanced systems-theoretical point of view, the logic
of Sztompka’s analyses of trust withers away when he extends it to the
communal and systemic levels. It appears that trust has several functions, or
trust is needed everywhere. It encourages sociability, enlarges the field of
interactions, improves spontaneous collective action, encourages tolerance
and the acceptance of strangers. Sztompka argues that there is even some
kind of a of culture of trust, which develops the trustworthiness of different
networks. Sztompka (like Giddens) connects trust to human agency, not
communication. For Sztompka, trust has reached its cultural model through
“social becoming” (Sztompka 1991). There are four assumptions central to
the model of this social becoming.

124

<-----Page 138----->First, the driving force of social processes is human agency, that is
individual and collective actions, decisions, and choices taken by
specifically endowed actors, within the framework of opportunities
provided by existing structures. Second, the ongoing events making up the
social praxis are always complex products of some traits of actors
combined with some traits of structures, or to put it otherwise they result
from the exploration of existing structural opportunities by willing and
competent actors. Third, the structural context itself and the opportunities it
provides are shaped and reshaped by ongoing praxis; they are the
accumulated, lasting outcomes, of the unintended, of the multiplicity of
earlier actions. Fourth, the structural effects of past praxis, crystallized as
structural tradition, become the initial conditions for future praxis, and are
explored as structural resources, and this cycle proceeds interminably
making all processes contingent and open-ended. (Sztompka 1999, 120.)
Following the model of ‘social becoming’, the relevant praxis consists of
individual and collective actions in which people deploy trust. Looking
backward, we shall see that with regard to trust, people act within some
received tradition; that is, the prevailing cultural climate of trust, or the
reverse, the culture of distrust. Positive experiences of confirmed trust will
generate a culture of trust; negative experiences of breached trust will
generate a culture of distrust. In this way the normative climate for future
bets of trust will be created, the tradition of trust or distrust will be passed
on, and the process will continue interminably.
Sztompka’s culturally oriented approach does not fit in with Luhmann’s
autopoietic systems-theoretical thinking, the driving force of which is not
human

agency

but

communication.

The

advanced

Luhmannian

communicative trust – which must always be renewed – cannot have any
cultural or normative elements. In general, Sztompka does not even talk
about (advanced Luhmannian) trust (or confidence) as if it were oriented
towards risks in the context of a communal or systemic level. If anything,
his conception seems to be closer to Parsons’ structural functionalism, in
wherein trust can be regarded as a feeling which is based on norms and
values, an approach whose problems I have already indicated. The ‘social
becoming of trust’ or ‘culture of trust’ ought to be left to the sphere of
cultural research, or regarded as an ethnographical account of trust.
125

<-----Page 139----->Furthermore, Sztompka (1996; 1998; 1999) has used a particularly
ethnographical approach in his empirical studies of trust, which concern the
recent history of Poland. According to Sztompka (1999, xi): “The
vicissitudes and fluctuations of trust and distrust during the last fifty years
of Polish history, as well as the condition of trust in the present turbulent
period of postcommunist transformations have proven to be an excellent
‘strategic research site’, a kind of useful laboratory for applying and testing
the viability of theoretical concepts and models.” Sztompka has not used
even ‘early’ Luhmann’s ideas in this research, even though he had the
chance and capabilities for making history by being the first sociologist to
widely us Luhmann's theoretical ideas of trust for empirical purposes. It
may be that Sztompka found testing Luhmann’s theoretical ideas through
empirical research difficult, even impossible. Sztompka (1998) also claims
that institutionalising and implementing democratic institutions are
important structural and contextual conditions of society, without which
encouraging a culture of trust would be impossible. “For the sake of raising
generalized trust, or fighting historically ingrained distrust, the most
conducive policy is building democratic institutions and safeguarding their
consistent” (Sztompka 1998, 31.) All in all, since Sztompka’s theory of
trust as a whole does not follow in the footsteps of Luhmann’s autopoietic
systems theory, and he has dispensed of even ‘early’ Luhmann’s theoretical
influence in his empirical writings on trust, Sztompka’s analyses of trust
are, in the end, not very fruitful with regard to my following systemstheoretical elaborations of trust and confidence.
Finally, I would like to comment on one communal form of trust that
Sztompka also mentions. This recent popular scientific debate has linked
trust to social capital. This discussion is largely based on economic
semantics. In addition, it also has ethnographic characteristics. In his study
of the economic backwardness of Southern Italy, Robert Putnam (1993)
suggested the idea of social capital, by which he referred to those “features
of social life – networks, norms, and trust – that enable participants to act
together more effectively to pursue shared objectives…Social capital, in
126

<-----Page 140----->short, refers to social connections and the attendant norms and trust”
(Putnam 1995, 664-665). This concept was also crucial for the argument of
Francis Fukuyama (1995), who saw in it the secret of economic
development in South-East Asia.
According to this discussion (Coleman 1990; Putnam 1993; 1995;
Fukuyama 1995, Ilmonen 2000), trust matters because it is perhaps the
most essential part of social capital. Putnam (1993; 1995), following James
Coleman (1990, 300), argues that social capital refers to features of social
organisation, such as core values and norms (including social trust) and
networks, that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.
“The theory of social capital presumes that, generally speaking, the more
we connect with other people, the more we trust them, and vice versa”
(Putnam 1995, 665). For Fukuyama (1995, 26), “trust is the expectation that
arises within a community of regular, honest, cooperative behaviour, based
on communally shared norms, on the part of other members of that
community”. Like Sztompka, trust is primarily cultural in nature for
Putnam and Fukuyama, too. As a matter of fact, Fukuayma (1995, 336)
says that trust is inherited form “preexisting communities of shared moral
norms or values”.
I do not wish to discuss at length the theories of social capital in this work,
because their proponents have not generally used Luhmann as their
theoretical background. Yet I would like to note that a couple of sentences
can be found in Luhmann’s writings in which he at least linguistically
moves on the same level with the discussion of social capital. In these
instances, Luhmann uses capital as a metaphor of trust.
The possibilities for action increase proportionately to the increase in trust –
trust in one’s own self-presentation and in other people’s interpretation of
it. When such trust has been established, new ways of behaving become
possible; jokes, unconventional initiatives, bluntness, verbal short cuts,
well-timed silences, the choice of delicate subjects etc. When trust is tested
and proven in this way, it can be accumulated by way of capital. (Luhmann
1979, 40).
127

<-----Page 141----->The authors discussing social capital conceptualise trust as a given “moral
resource of the community” (Putnam 1993, 169), a conception which seems
to maintain Parsonsian ideas of a community, that, from a Luhmannian
perspective appear outdated. Moreover, Fukuyama’s faith in inherited
cultural dispositions is related to the fact that he defines trust without
reference to risk. According to Warren (1999, 322), “one reason Fukuyama
misses the link between trust and risk is that he confuses trust with
something more like familiarity, a way of interacting with others that
depends upon projecting knowledge of the past onto future interactions.
This backward-looking confidence is the key element of Fukuyama’s
location of trust in inherited expectations sanctioned by communities.”
Furthermore, the discussion on social capital is economically oriented and
also has some ethnographic elements. It would be more adequate to study it
further in the context of Sztompka’s theory of ‘social becoming’ or ‘culture
of trust’ than to explicate its relevance from the point of view of closed
systems theory. Even from Sztompka’s perspective, the discussion of social
capital might be regarded as too simplistic a view of the problematics of
trust. As Sztompka (1999, 197) notes: Putnam’s intuition of the link
between trust and networks is right, “but in my interpretation the link is not
definitional, but empirical, causal, operating through the mechanism of
providing backup insurance for trust”.
To conclude, Giddens and Sztompka do not follow Luhmann’s advanced
systems theory but only make citations of his works on trust. Therefore,
their conceptions of trust are very different from that which I have
developed. It seems unnecessary to continue with Giddens’ and Sztompka’s
approaches (due to their ‘un-systems-theoretical’ character) in adapting the
advanced Luhmannian conceptions of trust and confidence for today’s
personal relations (through strangers) and systemic functions (through the
system of the welfare state and system of care). The classical texts on trust
by Simmel are more useful in this context, since they affected Luhmann’s
128

<-----Page 142----->own writings on the topic and thus have also indirectly affected the
advanced concepts of trust and confidence analysed in this work.
Thus far I have emphasised several times Parsons’ influence on the ‘early’
Luhmannian conception of trust, paying less attention to Simmel’s role in
this respect. However, as noted above, Luhmann’s concept of trust was
influenced by Simmel’s classical writings about the stranger. Unfortunately,
Luhmann does not consider the problems between trust and the stranger to
any great extent. In the next chapter I examine the problems of and
connections between strangers and trust. Particularly, I shall aim to show
how the expansion of the market economy universalised Simmel’s
traditional stranger (the ‘Jew’) and affected the usefulness of Simmel’s
concept of trust in explaining the relations between ‘universal strangers’.
To grasp the trust problems concerning today’s universal strangers I shall
examine the connection between the advanced systems-theoretical concept
of trust and the ‘indifferent stranger’ by Rudolf Stichweh. I also analyse
certain relative weaknesses in Stichweh’s concept of the ‘indifferent
stranger’ and discern the importance of the friend/enemy binary opposition.

129

<-----Page 143----->6. Strangers in Our Midst The Problem of Trust from ‘Potential Wanderer’ to
‘Indifferent Stranger’
Georg Simmel is often regarded as the founding father of the concept of
stranger in sociology, and the literature on ‘the stranger’ usually recognises
his authority in formulating a sociology of strangerhood. Occasionally, this
literature provides us with a reformulation of the concept of stranger
through specific types of actors. For example, the Simmelian stranger has
been the basis for Park’s ‘marginal man’ (1928), Wood’s ‘the newcomer’
(1934) and Siu’s ‘the sojourner’ (1952). As noted above, Simmel can also
be considered the founding father of the concept of trust in sociology. His
work on trust has influenced key authors in the field, such as Niklas
Luhmann, Anthony Giddens, Barbara Misztal and Piotr Sztompka (see
Möllering 2001). The basic features of Simmel’s concept of trust have
already been explicated in chapter two. I will next analyse Simmel’s
classical conception of the stranger, especially the basic characteristics and
some particularities of the Simmelian ‘potential wanderer’. I especially
consider the way Simmelian trust functions between traditional strangers
and natives. The essential question is: Why was the ‘potential wanderer’ a
trustworthy person?

Simmel’s Stranger
Simmel wrote about Der Fremde, the stranger, in a brief excursion within
his Soziologie (1908). There he introduced the famous, compelling image of
the ‘potential wanderer’.
The stranger is thus being discussed here, not in the sense often touched
upon in the past, as the wanderer who comes today and goes tomorrow, but
rather as the person who comes today and stays tomorrow. He is, so to
speak, the potential wanderer: although he has not moved on, he has not
quite overcome the freedom of coming and going. He is fixed within a
130

<-----Page 144----->particular spatial group, or within a group whose boundaries are similar to
spatial boundaries. But his position in this group is determined, essentially,
by the fact that he has not belonged to it from the beginning, that he imports
qualities to, which do not and cannot stem from the group itself. (Simmel
1950, 402.)
Simmel’s stranger thus comes to one place from another and may or may
not leave. For Simmel, the community is fixed to place. Coming and going
is equated with entering and exiting. If a man enters a new place or
community he automatically becomes a stranger for the locals of that
community. It is also typical for Simmel’s stranger that the degree of his
orientation towards membership is very flexible: the stranger does not
orientate himself towards joining the group, nor does the group encourage
him to join. Furthermore, it is assumed that the stranger does belong
somewhere else, that there is a home or point of origin which has shaped
his history. Strangers are, therefore, neighbours who are not like us. By
category, strangers are a double provocation: they are locals, and yet they
do not assume the stereotypical behaviour that locals develop and maintain
for themselves. Simmel’s stranger is close to those he does not know or
who are socially distant, and far from those to whom he feels most close.
Or, as Simmel (1950, 402) puts it:
The unity of nearness and remoteness involved in every human relation is
organized, in the phenomenon of the stranger…distance means that he, who
is close by, is far, and strangeness means that he, who also is far, is actually
near.
Moreover, Simmel identifies objectivity as one of the key characteristics of
the stranger. This objectivity is “a particular structure composed of distance
and nearness, indifference and involvement” (Simmel, 1950, 403). That is
to say, a stranger is someone who is not without experience in life, and is
thus able to maintain some distance from the immediate situation and see
human matters in a perspective different from others. I would say that
Simmel’s figure of the stranger is a freer (practically and theoretically) and
therefore also a more complex character than the other people in the
community. Simmel concludes with the general claim that individuality
131

<-----Page 145----->itself is universally estranging. He contends that what humans have in
common is what makes us familiar, and what we do not have in common is
what makes us strange (see Harman 1988, 18). This non-common element
is nothing individual, but merely the strangeness of origin, which is or
could be common to many strangers. For this reason, strangers are not
really conceived as individuals, but as strangers of a particular type. For
Simmel, the Jews were a special case of such strangers.
It can be concluded that Simmel’s stranger is an element of the group itself,
an element whose membership within the group involves being outside it
and confronting it. The stranger is thus capable of communicating, but is
incapable of thinking the same way as the other members of the group.
Because he has come from elsewhere, he does not share the same values,
norms and history. Through communication at the latest, the structural
difference of the stranger becomes visible to the group. The stranger
interprets reality differently, and because of these nonconforming
interpretations, is less involved with the group or community. But this is
precisely what makes the stranger irreplaceable for the group. As Lesley
Harman (1988, 18) notes, “because he is not involved enough to affect the
outcome of anything he is told, he does not pose a threat; yet he is a
compelling listener by virtue of his perceived objective stance”. The
stranger is an objective neighbour for the group, not a participating member
of the family.
Looking more closely at Simmel’s concept of the stranger, it is easy to find
some obvious particularities. First, Simmel’s strength was to show that
there is a real place for the stranger in a society. The stranger was an
element of the group although he was outside of it. Second, Simmel’s
stranger did not necessarily look for a home. He is just a wanderer who
comes today and stays tomorrow. Third, Simmel’s stranger is selfcontained, objective and self-referential, and therefore not necessarily
membership-oriented. In Simmel’s case, the stranger becomes and remains
an important element, yet not an essential part of the group, though he at the
132

<-----Page 146----->same time changes, or at least affects, its consistence and structure.
Strangers are locals, fixed within a certain spatial circle but they do not
share the local stereotypes.

Generalisation and Universalisation of the Stranger
For Simmel, the traditional stranger (‘potential wanderer’) appears as a
trader (the Jew). However, the group does not need a trader for as long as
its economy is essentially self-sufficient, or the exchange of products is
limited to the group. A trader is only required for products that originate
from outside the group. Insofar as members do not leave the circle in order
to buy these necessities – in which case they become the ‘strange’
merchants in that outside territory – the trader must be a stranger. (Simmel
1950, 402.)
The expansion of market economy and the growing status of money have
also affected the concept of stranger. During the course of its evolution,
money has increasingly lost its function as useful or valuable material in
itself, gradually turning into a mere symbolisation of other values. In both
The Philosophy of Money and ‘The Stranger’, Simmel portrays the effect of
money using the same terms that he employs for the stranger. As mentioned
above, the stranger is characterised by the fact that he is at one time both
distant and close, a part of the group and indifferent to it. In precisely the
same way, money signifies the object’s value while remaining indifferent to
it. Both facilitate and augment the atomisation of society and the individual.
As a matter of fact, money completely changed the stranger’s mode of
being. Amos Morris-Reich (2003, 135) encapsulates this change with a
quite powerful choice of words:
Money alienates one from fellow men and from objects. As a powerful
force of social differentiation, it produces universal alienation. Universal
alienation is accounted for in terms of distance, detachment and
indifference, precisely those terms that characterize the position of the
stranger. Money, therefore, universalizes the stranger’s mode of being.
133

<-----Page 147----->The homology between the stranger (particularly the Jew) and money ends
when money universalises a particular situation previously associated with
the stranger. The universalisation of the stranger dialectically brings about
the concrete stranger. As Simmel (1990, 227) notes: “The contrast that
existed between the native and the stranger has been eliminated, because
the money of transactions has now been taken up by the whole economic
community.” Money changes the nature of society, generalises the
stranger’s position, and makes the concretised stranger superfluous. Thus
the stranger’s mode of being becomes universalised. (Morris-Reich, 2003,
135.)
In Simmel’s theory, there are at least two kinds of strangers. First, there is
the stranger who is characterised by an origin that is different from the
original group. Such strangers are positive because they can offer products,
ideas, knowledge, etc., which the group itself does not have, but which it
needs. In Simmel’s theory, this type of ‘stranger’ is the Jew or ‘potential
wanderer’. Second, the very nature of the stranger changed, or became
universalised, because of the universal alienation caused by money. This, of
course, affected reciprocal relationships and made life more complex and
uncertain. Both the Jew, as the ‘classic example’ of the stranger, and money
are powerful agents and catalysts of differentiation. They are the
‘indifferent third’, the stable reference point for and the symbol of a world
in continuous flux of interactive reality, which in turn cannot function
without trust.
Furthermore, because ‘strangers’ are not familiar to us, we might have
problems in trusting them. The universal alienation, caused by money,
further emphasises the problems between trust and ‘strangers’ because it
multiplies the number of ‘strangers’ as the modern society and its money
economy develop. In this context, the possibility of trusting ‘strangers’
emerges as an important object for sociological inquiry.
134

<-----Page 148----->Trustworthy Strangers
Simmel made a distinction between trust and confidence. He regarded trust,
first of all, as a force that works for and through individuals. Simmel
attributes a high moral value to trust, which makes it a rather special
medium of social exchange. Reciprocal trust is one of the most important
internal relations between the members of a society. Second, Simmel noted
that trust, or confidence, is a force that works for and through human
association more generally. It is a moral or institutional value which assists
in the development of confidential reciprocal relationships, or trust. Third,
Simmel recognised a religious further element, a kind of faith, which is
required for explaining trust and for understanding its unique nature. This
further element is a primary feeling which does not require reciprocity. This
is to say, it affects only what is beyond trust and confidence.
Regarding, then, the classic stranger, it would be easy to say that it was
almost impossible for him to be a trustworthy person, because he was not
an original member of the group. But this is not so in Simmel’s theory of
the stranger; for Simmel, the stranger nevertheless is a permanent element
of the group. Yet because he is not involved enough to affect the outcome
of anything he is told, he does not pose a threat. Therefore, I would insist
that the ‘potential wanderers’ were genuine recipients of trust because they
could not substantially abuse it.39
If anything, the native group was forced to trust strangers in order to able to
receive products or knowledge that originate outside it. Trusting was an
excellent way for a native group to communicate about the needed nonknowledge with strangers. They were the genuine source of trust. Trusting
39
Giddens makes a similar observation concerning the problem of Simmel’s stranger and
trust. He says that as Simmel pointed out, the meaning of the term ‘stranger’ changes with
the coming of modernity. In pre-modern cultures the ‘stranger’ refers to a ‘whole person’ –
someone who comes from the outside and who is potentially suspect. There may be many
respects in which a person moving into a small community form elsewhere fails to receive
the trust of the insiders, even perhaps after having lived in that community for many years.

135

<-----Page 149----->strangers implies taking some sort of a risk. Nonetheless, without trust, the
natives would have lived in a familiar world. Or as Simmel would say, they
would have then lived in a world of complete knowledge where there is no
need to trust (or for) strangers.
Strangers opened new perspectives; they challenged the fixed boundaries
and extended them socially and symbolically. As a matter of fact, if the
classic stranger, or the Jew, was the ‘indifferent third’, trust can be seen as
the type of third form of ‘the social’ through which he became the
‘interested third’ for the native group. Or, in other words, trust was a
resource which could add nearness between natives and strangers.
However, Simmel’s concepts of trust and confidence are tightly bound to
morals and community. Confidence is here seen as a moral value of a group
and it assists the development of everyday trust of its members. (Simmel
1990, 178-179.) Concerning, then, the arguments that money universalises
the stranger’s mode of being and eliminates the contrast between the native
and the stranger, we have problems to situate the universal strangers in the
context of Simmel’s conception of trust. In the age of universal strangers
there can no longer be largely accepted homogenous moral values which
steer groups’ confidential behaviour and everyday trust practices toward
strangers. I would say that we must talk about stranger-stranger-relations
rather than native-stranger-relationships. But, using Simmel's conception of
trust, this is impossible. Therefore, we must seek answers for the trust
problems between the universal strangers from the viewpoint of an
advanced Luhmannian theory of trust, which especially focuses on trust
relationships between ‘persons’ – as well as the functions of trust and
confidence – in a functionally differentiated modern society.

(See Giddens 1990, 80.) In modern societies people do not characteristically interact with

136

<-----Page 150----->The ‘Indifferent Strangers’ and the Problem of Inclusion
As noted before, the advanced Luhmannian concept of trust is tightly bound
to risks, not morals. A decision to trust always presupposes a situation of
risk, because it is possible for other to abuse the offered trust. This is tightly
connected with the fact that in complex societies, morality plays only a
peripheral role. The peripheral role of morals is also one reason that makes
the advanced Luhmannian conception of trust more adequate for the society
of ‘universal strangers’ than Simmel’s. Following the advanced
Luhmannian theory, it is quite evident that we decide to trust only strangers
who we think share the same interests and orientations with. But it should
be noted that Luhmann cannot, and probably would not even want to,
provide a comprehensive answer to the problem of trustworthy or
untrustworthy strangers. As a matter of fact, he does not directly theorise
the problem of the stranger at all. Due to the lack of satisfactory theorising
of the stranger by Luhmann, I will seek answers for trust problems
concerning ‘universal strangers’ in a systems-theoretical context from
Rudolf Stichweh’s writings on strangers. Stichweh is one of the very few
sociologists who have dealt with the concept of strangers from the point of
view of advanced Luhmannian systems theory.
In his seminal article The Stranger: On the Sociology of Indifference
(1997), Stichweh focuses on the stranger as a social category, not on
strangeness as a quality of experience. He approaches the problem of the
stranger especially within the social dimension of meaning by emphasising
the communicative acts through which somebody is identified as a stranger
in a social context. Stichweh (1997, 1-5) concludes that the classical
sociological approach to the stranger (Simmel) presupposes that the social
system (communication) classifying others as strangers describes itself as
being based on membership. Here, strangers are first of all non-members.
Those who do not conform to the communicational values and the world

strangers in the same way; if anything, we need them and are forced to trust them.

137

<-----Page 151----->view of the host society are automatically classified as strangers. As noted
above, it is through communication that the difference of the stranger
becomes visible for the natives.
However, Stichweh suggests that in an urban, functionally differentiated
setting, strangers become either invisible or omnipresent. In this milieu, the
category of the stranger loses its possible function of indicating a distinct
social figure. Modern individuals, according to Stichweh, relate to each
other neither as friend nor as enemy. From this premise, Stichweh
postulates that strangerhood has become universalised because the
dominant attitude among individuals in an urbanised environment is one of
indifference. As Stichweh (1997, 9) says:
This results in a decomposition of the Other which does not allow his
compact strangeness to be a basis of experience and action any longer.
Instead, it is decomposed into functional segments which are more easily
handled. One aspect which has often been emphasized is the temporal.
There are progressively more interactions of short duration. Therefore the
interaction partners remain strangers towards one another. The compactness
of a person in all its disturbing aspects is placed beyond the interaction
process.
In this systems-theoretical approach, it is important to note that late
modernity is understood as a highly differentiated social modality wherein
difference becomes something that constitutes the very basis of society,
rather than being confined to the margins (Marotta 2000, 129). Following
Luhmann (1986; 1997), this type of functionally differentiated society
consists of autopoietic subsystems such as the economy, religion, law,
politics, science, education etc., each of these systems being specialised,
fulfilling one and only one function for the society. However, we are
dealing with these systems every day, and thus meet also many unknown
representatives of these systems. From a systems theoretical point of view,
these ‘persons’ cannot be grasped neither as friends nor as enemies, they
have a kind of ‘third status’. As Stichweh (1997, 11) puts it. “Our dominant
attitude towards them is one of indifference, and that means, for instance,
that whenever we are together with a great number of them, our
138

<-----Page 152----->consciousness does not register them as individual persons.”

The

universalisation of the stranger, then, means that in modern social life
(urban environments, for example) social intercourse mostly involves
interacting with people whom we might refer to as strangers. However, this
implies that the strangeness of the other comes to be seen as a normal
everyday occurrence, whereby it loses its irritating, disturbing character. An
alternative interpretation speaks of the disappearance of the stranger or of
his invisibility. (Stichweh 2002, 3.)
I would like to argue that the Simmelian ‘indifferent third’ (the stranger)
can, in systems-theoretical thinking, be replaced by symbolically coded
communication. ‘Persons’ who communicate can be seen only as ‘carriers’
of coded communication with whom we mostly have impersonal
relationships. Moreover, our contacts with these ‘persons’ are temporally
quite short, and we are not always spatially connected with them (like in
Simmel’s case). Almost everyone can be seen as an ‘indifferent stranger’,
and strangerhood has thus been universalised.40
Stichweh also argues that there are several techniques which contribute to
the mechanisms of indifference. For example, the pretence of non-presence
can be an important technique. It is employed “in situations in which
differences and conflict potential are acute, and where the pretended
absence of the other neutralizes any considerable conflict potential. Such
pretences are reinforced by the art of avoidance.” (Stichweh 2002, 8.) In
practice, one increases one’s pace, crosses to the other side of the street and
avoids any eye contact, for example. Another technique is noncommunication despite the indisputable reciprocity of perception, which
surely is one of the most incredible accomplishments of modernity
(Stichweh 2002, 8). People can look at one another in a train, bus or
aeroplane for hours without speaking to each other and without advertising
40
It must be mentioned that in his essay Die Grossdtädte und das Geistesleben, Simmel
himself also sketched out a universally indifferent personality type. This personality type is
affected by a positive (liberal) freedom and can be seen as a product of the metropolis and
modern life (Noro 1996, 242).

139

<-----Page 153----->this fact as communication. On the positive side of this very same
interaction, Stichweh finds institutions for a minimal acceptance of the
other. “When people encounter and greet one another, even if they are
complete strangers, one of them smiles without the other having to do
anything to deserve it” (Stichweh 2002, 8). This smile, however, seems to
be culturally specific and not a universal institution. In Finland, for
example, instead of smiling, it is apparently still quite normal for a person
to present only a glimpse and then turn his eyes away thereby making it
clear to the other that he is a stranger and has to behave accordingly for the
time being.
In another article, Strangers, Inclusions, and Identities (2002b), Stichweh
has examined the disappearance of the stranger through the modern
inclusion and exclusion processes. By including and excluding strangers,
social systems – with clear membership criteria and social closure – define
at the same time what for them is normally and legitimately understood as
their collective identity. In the modern world the situation is different. As
Stichweh (2002b, 106-107) puts it:
It is wholly different with the modern world of inclusions and exclusions. It
is not that the concept of identity disappears, but that the concept itself loses
its clear-cut identity. It migrates into multiple contexts of its application and
usage. A first feature is that identity is particularized - or better - atomized.
Stichweh thus does not see today’s stranger as a compact social object who
has a deviant identity from the collective one. Rather, a person’s identity
and possible inclusion are formed through the communication processes of
systems. Namely, “identities obviously are inclusion identities; they refer to
the multiple inclusions processes which are characteristic of modern
society” (Stichweh 2002b, 107). Systems-theoretically, this means that
societal inclusion is possible only through communications, because society
consists only of communications. Modern society is characterised by the
complete inclusion of ‘persons’. This means that all members of a society
have to have access to the economy, the legal system, the political system,
140

<-----Page 154----->religion, scientific knowledge, and to mass media. Therefore, froma
systems-theoretical point of view, the reason behind the disappearance or
universalisation of the stranger was not only the universalising role of
money, but the gradual development of functional differentiation of society
and its affections to inclusion processes. Overcoming strangeness is no
longer a strategic problem for modern society. Rather, the strategic
problems deal more with fluidity of functional communications and the
complex construction of societal inclusion identities.

Trusting Indifference
The advanced Luhmannian theory of trust and Stichweh’s theory of
stranger sit well with a late modern society where native groups (tribe, race,
nation etc.) no longer play a crucial role in creating common confidential
values. Since Luhmann posits that all systems are autopoietic (they produce
and reproduce themselves through their own elements), it is no longer
important to separate human beings into different groups. Rather, all are
autopoietic individuals who partake of society only when they
communicate.
It is always up to the individual whether he decides to trust the other or not.
In other words, ‘people’ have to share some interests if they want to trust. It
can be said that the social world (the world of communication) is largely
reconstructed in terms of special interests. As Luhmann (1988, 101) puts it:
“Now, one may try to calculate and outwit these interests; one may see
ways to use the interests of others, which are reliable precisely because they
are interests”. The advanced Luhmannian concept of trust is primarily a
communicative and functional one, the main task of which is to reduce, not
eliminate, complexity. I would say that we decide to trust only those
strangers who might have the same interests with us. Here “trust should be
understood only from the point of view of its function” (Misztal 1996, 95).

141

<-----Page 155----->Moreover, comparing Simmel’s and Stichweh’s concepts of the stranger,
and especially taking note of the role of trust in the context of the stranger,
some obvious similarities can be found. Namely, both in the case of
Simmel’s classic stranger and Stichweh’s functional communicative actor,
trust is a possible bond through which the stranger becomes an important
person for the natives (in the traditional setting) or a communicative actor
for other strangers (in the modern setting). Reciprocal trust transforms the
classic stranger (the Jew) from ‘indifferent third’ into ‘interested third’.
This type of stranger is a wanderer who comes today and stays tomorrow.
Because he stays, he is important to natives and thus will be accepted as a
trustworthy person.
In functionally differentiated modern society, we encounter more of these
‘potential wanderers’. If we follow Stichweh’s conception of the stranger,
everyone is a wanderer for one another, or there are no longer any strangers
at all. Strangers are either invisible or omnipresent. All are like Stichweh
would say, indifferent for each other. However, we cannot live in the
differentiated society without contacts with these ‘indifferent strangers’.
Rather, we have more contacts with unknown ‘persons’ than before. It can
even be said that the ‘indifferent strangeness’ is a requirement of
subsystemic communication.
Here, again, the role of trust becomes essential. But it is certain that through
accepting or providing trust, the ‘indifferent stranger’ becomes important to
us. As stated above, we quite often trust the strangers whom we assume to
share our interests. Trust is away to transform the ‘indifferent stranger’ into
an interested one in differentiated society, too. In other words, through
perception we can choose certain strangers with whom we start to
communicate, and whom we possibly trust. Quite often (but not always) we
communicate with someone because of our interests. Furthermore, what
makes trust more important for a systems-theoretical approach to the
stranger than to Simmel’s is the fact that trust always presupposes a
situation of risk and usually does not have a direct bearing on morals. We
142

<-----Page 156----->may not have many other options than to trust strangers. As we have seen,
living in a completely familiar world has become almost impossible. Of
course, we can live in a familiar world, but that is the world of simple
interactions. Living in a functionally differentiated society presumes more
than communications on the level of simple interaction. Living in a modern
society is also full of risks, and hence presumes a problematisation of trust.

Some Problems of the Thesis Concerning the Disappearance
of the Stranger
Stichweh’s conclusion about the disappearance of the stranger might sound
appropriate in the context of advanced systems theory. However, it is also
possible to find the kinds of ‘indifferent strangers’, using Stichweh’s
terminology, whom we cannot trust and, above all, who do not share our
functional interests. These features characterise at least the Brasilian favelas
and Zygmunt Bauman’s postmodern type of stranger, the ‘new poor’.
According to Luhmann (1996d), in favelas people live in ‘absolute’
exclusion from the function systems and from all forms of communication
that demand more complex capabilities. By this type of exclusion people
are, so to speak, reduced to sheer bodies – and these orders of
inclusion/exclusion are perhaps in the process of becoming a primary form
of differentiation in the world society. Furthermore, if we follow recent
tragic events of the world (the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, the
bombings of March 2004 in Madrid and of July 2005 in London),
Stichweh’s conclusion that late modern individual would not relate to each
other as friend nor enemy, but indifferent, also becomes problematic.
The ‘New Poor’ as Strangers
Zygmunt Bauman sees the ‘new poor’ as untrustworthy ‘strangers’ in the
sphere of economy. For him, ‘the flawed consumers’ or ‘the new poor’ are
the embodiments of postmodern strangers (Stichweh might prefer the term
143

<-----Page 157----->‘late modern strangers’). According to Bauman (1997, 25; see also Marotta
2000, 122), these ‘flawed consumers’ or ‘the new poor’ are postmodern
strangers because they are the by-products of the “never concluding process
of identity building”. They are the products of the consumer market: the
unemployable (both young and old), single mothers, welfare recipients, the
unskilled and inflexible workers. The ‘new poor’, argues Bauman, are
bureaucratically controlled and administered, and the sole purpose of
welfare legislation and practice is to disempower the poor. (Marotta 2000,
124.)
The postmodern stranger is also captured in the category of the vagabond.
Vagabonds wander, not out of desire but because they are pushed out.
Bauman (1998, 92) notes that “vagabonds are the waste of the world which
has dedicated itself to the tourist service”. Both the tourist and the
vagabond are consumers, but the vagabond represents the ‘new poor’
(Bauman 1998, 96). They are strangers to the tourists. They are what the
tourist may become, and so it is in the tourist’s vested interest to render the
alternative as dreadful and as repulsive as possible (Bauman 1998, 98).
These flawed consumers “are the waste-product of the game” (Bauman
1998b, 75), and instead of “meriting care and assistance [and thus also
trust], [they] deserve hate and condemnation” (Bauman 1997, 43).
The majority of people do not have need to trust the ‘new poor’ because
they do not have similar functional interests. Are the ‘new poor’ forced to
live or communicate in the margin, or in the state of exclusion, by means of
politics (power) and jurisprudence (law)? They may not have reached the
communicational inclusion identity within these systems. As Vince Marotta
(2000, 130) says, although difference may constitute the very basis of a
postmodern society, marginalisation, exploitation and exclusionary
practices are still intrinsically connected to the way contemporary society
relates to Otherness41. Bauman’s example clearly shows that these
41

It seems that Marotta does not distinguish strangeness from otherness. The otherness of
another human being is an incontrovertible and hence universal social experience. It is the

144

<-----Page 158----->postmodern strangers cannot be conceived of in a positive way like
Simmel’s stranger. Rather, they are seen as a threat by the majority.
Bauman’s perspective on the stranger is pessimistic and somewhat
deterministic. According to him, strangers are victims of forces they cannot
control. (See Järvinen 2003). Furthermore, the ‘new poor’ (or the Brasilian
favelas) cannot be sketched out as Stichwehian indifferent persons because
they are neither invisible nor omnipresent. Because of their inadequate
capability to communicate in the system of economy (with the medium of
money), they are functionally irrelevant for the majority and become more
visible and present, more like strangers.
Through Bauman’s conception of the ‘new poor’ and Luhmann’s favelas,
we easily realise that Stichweh’s argument on the disappearance of the
stranger in the late or postmodern society cannot be completely true.
However, from a systems-theoretical point of view, strangers are even more
immanent than Bauman and Marotta assume. They have not necessarily
been excluded from society. Rather, the functional differentiation of society
means complete inclusion. But, at the same time, inclusion is by no means
the solution for the problem of inequality, but a part of it. Although general
inclusion has become reality in all modern societies, inclusion does not
mean equal inclusion. (Nassehi 2004, 5-6.) Inclusion has increased people’s
inability to communicate equally in each subsystem. Most clearly the
inequality in taking part in systems’ functions is manifested in the system of
economy. Similarly, I would say that people have unequal resources to take
part in the functions of politics, law as well as education. Therefore,
following Stichweh’s conception of the stranger, there are also more and
more communicative acts through which somebody in a social context is
identified as a stranger. If someone is identified as stranger, then he has not
reached equal inclusion identity within the system. Every functional
absolute precondition for my experience of myself as my Self in contradistinction to the
otherness of another human being. It is only possible to speak of strangeness, in contrast,
when the otherness of another human being is experienced as irritating or disturbing.
Ambivalence and uncertainty characteristically accompany the experience of strangeness.
(Stichweh 2002, 1.)

145

<-----Page 159----->subsystem thus itself creates its own social (communicative) category of the
stranger as well as its own inclusion identity. The most visible character of
this particular type or category of the stranger is a deviant and deficient
ability to communicate with the media of the system. Thus, the sociological
problematic of the stranger can be grasped and examined further also in the
light of inclusion/exclusion-schematism. Yet this does not revoke the fact
that strangeness is still a strategic problem of contemporary society.
Return to the Friend/Enemy Binary Opposition
Despite the universalising role of money, increased indifference, and
changed basis of inclusion identities, it seems obvious that the problem of
the stranger has not disappeared. Neither is it self-evident that the binary
opposition friend/enemy would have lost its societal meaning in the age of
world society. Stichweh (1997, 11) notes also, that “the schematism
friend/enemy functions only in extreme situations as a political
schematism”. Rather, he adds, “in democratic politics it is easy to see that
modern politics is less interested in its enemies than in the question of how
to motivate the undecided, normally indifferent elector” (Stichweh 1997,
12).
However, the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and their
consequences exemplify a new relationship between ourselves and others
(Japp 2003, 55). Terrorists affect us through means of violence. According
to Luhmann (1979, 149), violence is a form of power which is a matter of
relatively simple action, easily organised and thus can be centralised. We
live in a world where “the possibility of the use of violence cannot be
ignored by the person affected” (Luhmann 1979, 149). Violence might
threaten communication of the world society and even the continuity of
some systems (like politics or the economy).
After these tragic events Stichweh’s argument, that modern politics would
be less interested in its enemies than in the question of motivating
146

<-----Page 160----->indifferent electors, becomes questionable. We are now living in conditions
of resentment and revolt which cannot be divorced from the inequities and
discontent stemming from globalisation. It is also true that social and
economic globalisation has opened up new targets for attack, new means of
attacking and new opportunities for publicity. Most present-day terrorism
and its consequences have a global effect. (Etzioni 2002.) Terrorism is a
global risk, which concerns the world society within all its dimensions:
social, evolutional and factual (Japp 2003, 82). In the functionally
differentiated world society, the old friend/enemy binary opposition – which
played an important role in stratified societies – has evidently re-emerged in
a new form: West and Islam. However, this binary opposition has now been
emphasised in the context of function systems of world society; especially
politically, but also socially (in everyday interaction) and culturally (the
growing suspicion against Muslims). It can be said that the world society’s
Eigenstructure – which reproduces pre-existent cultural diversity and
creates new social and cultural patterns – has absorbed this binary
opposition at the level of almost every function system of the world society
– such as science, politics, education, law and others.
However, it is also quite obvious that the terrorist is exactly an enemy and
not a stranger in the Simmelian sense. The terrorist cannot be the
Simmelian stranger because he is not a potential wanderer who comes
today and stays tomorrow, and immediate objectivity is not one of his key
characteristics. He is not an objective neighbour for the group but rather
something else: a particular type who threatens us by way of hostile rhetoric
and malevolent acts. The terrorist cannot either be regarded as the
Stichwehian ‘indifferent stranger’ who becomes an important and
trustworthy ‘person’ if he has the same interests as the other. Neither can
these terrorists be identified with Baumannian ‘new poor’ because the
threat represented by terrorists is fundamental and not only economic.
Nonetheless, it is certain that terrorists are invisible and omnipresent. John
Urry (2002, 66) calls terrorist groups or organisations “global fluids” which
147

<-----Page 161----->“are hard to defeat because they are made up of very different selforganizing elements that regularly change their shape, form and activities.
Such mutating capacity renders the network ‘invisible’, if, on occasion
awesomely present.” Without these qualities the attacks of terrorists would
be avoidable and, therefore, impossible. Paradoxically, the terrorists of
today might be more familiar than strange. We may have trusted them
before their attacks. They are people who have created trustworthy relations
in the world they eventually attacked. For example, the terrorists behind the
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were members of an
organised religious terrorist group. Yet they were also members of the
global, functionally differentiated society. They benefited from Western
culture

(educationally,

economically,

militarily

etc.)

and

created

trustworthy relationships in the West, but for one reason or another rejected
assimilation and continued to adhere to and propagate the values, customs,
and cultures of their native societies.
These types of people are, thus, enemies within the group of friends. It can
be concluded, then, that the strategic problem of global society concerns to
a greater degree – or at least as much – the friend/enemy binary opposition
as the problem of the stranger. This is also a fact which underlines the
importance of trust, but also its susceptibility to risk: The possible enemies,
especially terrorists, surely abuse our trust more fundamentally than
‘indifferent strangers’ or the ‘new poor’.
However, we must note that exclusions in the global society and tragic
events like terrorist attacks affect our self-presentation and readiness to
trust. As Luhmann (1979, 82) says: “The inner assurance which comes
from being equal to the demands of self-presentation in all situations, and
of always knowing a practicable way out even from bungled situations, is
one of those inner resources which serve as a foundation for readiness to
trust”. The ‘person’ who trusts presents himself as someone who is by his
nature inclined to bestow trust. If the trust then turns out to have been
148

<-----Page 162----->misplaced, the truster is not only disappointed but in the case of ‘new poor’,
excluded, and in the case of terrorism even killed.
To conclude, it can be argued that the sociological problem of trust never
posed itself. Strangers were indispensable for natives and did not pose a
direct threat. Rather, strangers were trustworthy because they had the type
of knowledge or products without which natives could not live. However,
the universal strangeness consequent upon money’s universalising role
raises sociological problems between ‘strangers’ and trust, which cannot be
explained by Simmel’s conceptual framework.
The advanced and functionally oriented Luhmannian concept of trust is
better suiter for the society of ‘universal strangers’ than that of Simmel’s,
because this systems-theoretically oriented concept does not emphasise the
roles of community and morals but the function of trust is (like it was
already in Luhmann’s Vertrauen), to put it simply, to reduce complexity.
However, from a systems-theoretical point of view, money (or the growing
significance of the economy) was not the only reason for the disappearance
or universal role of the stranger, but rather the systems-theoretical roots of
this change can be associated with the gradual development of functional
differentiation of society. In this type of society, ‘persons’ are, according to
Stichweh, indifferent to each other, and we don’t register them as individual
persons, but rather as ‘carriers’ of coded communication. The overcoming
of strangeness is thus no longer a strategic problem; today’s real problems
have more to do with the fluidity of functional communication. It is
systems-theoretically important also to conceive trust more as a functional
communicative decision than a moral value of a group.
However, in his conception of the indifferent stranger, Stichweh
overemphasises the figure’s functional disappearance. Through Zygmunt
Bauman’s conception of the ‘new poor’, we realise that strangeness and
trusting strangers are still problems of late modern society. Although
Bauman’s image of the ‘new poor’ is intensely typified to strangers within
149

<-----Page 163----->the system of economy, other function systems (politics, jurisprudence,
education etc.) also produce strangeness, which becomes explicit in
communication activities. If a ‘person’ has an unequal capacity for
participation in the system’s function (communication) he can be quite
easily typified as functionally constricted, or as the stranger whom we do
not want trust, because he does not have the same interests as we do.
Systems-theoretically this can be expressed by stating that these persons
have not reached an equal inclusion identity in the system.
Finally, Stichweh’s other claim about the lost importance of the
friend/enemy opposition is also problematic. The rising wave of
international terrorism proves something completely opposite. Terrorists
cannot be seen as strangers neither from Simmel’s, Stichweh’s or Bauman’s
perspectives. Rather, they are invisible and omnipresent enemies. What
makes them more dangerous than strangers is the fact that we may have
trusted them before the attacks and their way of abusing our trust is fatal.
Therefore, some of the most important strategic problems of late modern
society are better understood in terms of the binary opposition between
friend/enemy than in terms of the concept of stranger.

150

<-----Page 164----->7. Confidence and the Luhmannian System of the
Welfare State
Having explored how trust functions in the context of strangers I will now
move the analysis to a systemic level. While the problem of the stranger has
to do with personal relations of trust, the effects of societal subsystems in
our lives raise questions concerning system trust, or confidence. We are
more dependent on the different subsystems than before. This is largely
because general inclusion has become reality in all modern societies.
According to my hypothesis, general inclusion is connected to the evolution
of the modern welfare state. Therefore, in this chapter I will analyse the
Luhmannian cyclic model of the welfare state and the functions of
advanced Luhmannian trust and confidence within it. In his book Politische
Theorie im Wohlfartsstaat (1981; 1990), Luhmann examines the welfare
state as an autopoietic subsystem which has overheated because it has too
many obligations to its citizens. In other words, the system of the welfare
state has made too many demands on itself. I shall explore the taxing and
steering problems which result from these obligations. In order to be able to
study the logic of the welfare state, as well as the problems of trust and
confidence within it, I must also widen the analyses from ‘personal’ and
systemic contexts to the organisational context. This is necessary because
the system of the welfare state (as well as other functional subsystems)
consists of and is affected by several organisations.

Inclusion and the Welfare State
From the Luhmannian perspective, society consists of communication, not
of people. In other words, it consists of everything that is recognised as
communication by one or more of its subsystems. These subsystems are
autopoietic,

self-referential

and

reproduce

themselves

only

via

communication. The operations of the political system are important from
151

<-----Page 165----->the viewpoint of the differentiation of the welfare state.

42

However,

Luhmann always stresses that ‘the political’ is not identical with the state.
The political is an intensely complex fabric of communications, which is
certainly “oriented around the state” (Luhmann 1990, 123), but which
cannot be reduced to the conscious decisions made by particular individuals
or departments (or other organisations) within the state. In contrast to the
Old-European sociological tradition, Luhmann does not want to separate
state and society. State is nothing outside society, it is nothing more than a
“formula of unity for the self-description of the political system… the
political system describes itself as a state because communication that uses
this formula is likely to be treated as understandable” (Luhmann 1990, 128;
123). State is not, then, a ‘centre’ which can steer the society. As Luhmann
(1990, 31) says: “A society which is structured according to function
systems has no central agency. It is a society without an apex or center.”
Rather, the subsystems function in one another’s environment and do not
directly influence other systems’ operations. But as we know, because of
structural couplings these systems are also indirectly dependent on other
systems’ functions.
Society is the all-encompassing social system that orders all possible
communication among human beings. The political system is one of its
subsystems alongside other subsystems for religion, science, economy,
education, family life, medical care etc. The individual subsystems
actualize society from their specific point of view according to
correspondingly specific system/environment perspectives. Thus the
economic and education systems belong to the environment of the political
system, and conversely the political system belongs to the environment of
education and the economy. This distinction does not exclude extensive
42

The greatest influential sociologists behind Luhmann’s political writings are perhaps
Parsons and Helmut Schelsky. Schelsky’s influence in Luhmann’s theory of the welfare
state is obvious. Schelsky demands that we recognise the importance of the type of
institutions which reflect the purely functional character of modern humanity. In the essay
Der Mensch in der wissenschaftlichen Zivilisation (1965), he argues that the modern
political apparatus is no longer ordered around the formation of a popular political will,
and that the classical substance of democracy has been superseded by a logic of functional
competence. The modern political system thus legitimises itself solely insofar as it can
develop technical solutions to the problems which it confronts, and politics in the sense of
a normative will-formation is no longer a sustainable concept. (See King & Thornhill
2003, 169-170.) Schelsky’s functionalist arguments pave the way for Luhmann’s account
of a society which cannot be centred on any stable foundation of human reason or agency.

152

<-----Page 166----->reciprocal dependencies. Instead, it assumes demands on and increasing
fulfilment of the function systems in society. (Luhmann 1990, 30.)
The welfare state is characterised most often as a state that supplies
extensive social benefits to particular classes of the population, and
consequently must find constant sources of revenue for this. This usual
characterisation is strongly connected with economic growth (the economic
system) and to a lesser degree with political development (the political
system). For example, the post-war German welfare model, the context for
Luhmann’s writings on the welfare state,43 “was based on the idea of a
‘social state’, sometimes rendered as a ‘social market economy’. The
central principle of this model was that social welfare would most
effectively be furthered through economic development, and that the
structure of social services had to reflect that.” (Spicker 2000, 147.) In this
model, the general concern is “to ensure that public expenditure on welfare
is directly compatible with the need for economic development and growth”
(Spicker 2000, 147).
Meanwhile, in systems-theoretical thinking the welfare state is a part of the
political system, and economic growth is thus not the prime basis of the
welfare state. Rather, the differentiation of the welfare state is connected to
the communication of the political system. The subsystems of the economy,
law, science, education and religion, have affected the development of the
welfare state, but only indirectly, through structural couplings. For these
reasons – diverging from the economically oriented approaches - Luhmann
formulates his concept of the welfare state with the help of the sociological
principle of inclusion.
Luhmann developed the concept of inclusion to replace the concept of
social integration (see Habermas 1981; 1985). According to Luhmann
43
It must be mentioned here that before his academic career, Luhmann worked at the
Higher Administrative Court in Lüneburg working on a file-card system which holds the
decisions of the court, then at the Ministry of education of Lower Saxony, Hannover,
dealing with questions of compensation for Nazi injustice. Therefore, he also had
professional experience of the post-war German welfare system.

153

<-----Page 167----->(1995c, 237-264), the concept of social integration is misleading because it
lays too much emphasis on normative concurrence and does not schematise
the problem of exclusion. Furthermore, Luhmann’s approach has some
similar characteristics with T.H. Marshall’s (1950) theory of the civil,
political and social rights which revolutionise the hierarchic model of
society. Diverging from Marshall, who emphasises the expanding rights of
the citizen, Luhmann stresses the importance of expanding communication
and gradual inclusion. Through the model of inclusion, society defines not
rights, but the conditions of functional participation. As Luhmann (1990c,
34) notes:
The concept of inclusion means an encompassment of the entire population
in the performances of the individual function systems. On one hand, this
concerns access to these benefits and, on the other, dependence of
individual modes of living on them. To the extent that inclusion is achieved,
groups disappear that do not participate in social living, or do so only
marginally.
With the help of the inclusion developed within the welfare state, society
tries to produce and reproduce the conditions of participation, and thus
prevent people from being pushed into exclusion.44 Furthermore, with
functional differentiation, individuals in society become dependent on
being included in most or all of the function systems pertaining to their own
welfare. According to Roar Hagen (2000, 38), “these interdependencies are
observed by society, which has developed two main forms of inclusion to
counter exclusion at the level of subsystems: (1) legal rights to access, more
ore less backed by economic means, and (2) social policy or social help
when exclusion is not seen as a failure of the system, but is attributed to the
affected individual.”

44
It should be noted that the distinction of inclusion and exclusion is, at the moment, one
of the liveliest topics of research and debate in systems theory (see Stäheli & Stichweh
2002; Schwinn 2004). There are arguments that focus on the system level at which
inclusions and exclusions operate (organisations and functions systems); one important
research question regards the interrelations of inequality and exclusion; and probably the
most interesting research problems have to do with the dynamics internal to the distinction

154

<-----Page 168----->A ‘person’s’ capability to communicate (to be in society) increases if he
reaches the condition of inclusion within the welfare state. As an individual
(as an organic and psychic system), a ‘person’ lives outside the function
systems (in the environment). “But every individual must have access to
every function system if and insofar as his mode of living requires the use
of the functions (legal, economic, political etc.) of society. Every function
system encompasses the entire population, but only with the respective
aspects that are functionally relevant.” (Luhmann 1990, 35.) Everyone
enjoys a legal status and the protection of the law. Everyone can acquire
and spend money. The realisation of the principle of inclusion within the
functional domain of politics ultimately leads to the welfare state; the
welfare state is the realisation of political inclusion (Luhmann 1990, 35-36).
This involves not only the securing and continuous improvement of
minimum standards (legal rights) of social well-being for everyone but also
attendance to specific problems (social policy/social help) of the most
diverse kind that can become serious for those caught in difficult situations.
Improvement thus proceeds not only in the direction of raising minimum
standards, but also in the direction of the identification of ever new
problems as public concerns. These new social problems have gradually
affected the political agenda through the realisation of democracy and the
needs and interests of the population. This was “since politicians have to
win the approval of the population to attain office, it is advisable for them
to address its interests, to propose improvements and to point out problems”
(Luhmann 1990, 36).

The Cyclic Model of the System of the Welfare State
In all pre-modern societal systems the social order was based on hierarchy,
where the function of the medium of political system, power, operated
between dominating (commands) and dominated (obedience) parts. In
modern society this is impossible. The transition from a stratified society to
inclusion/exclusion and with its interrelations with the world society (see more Stichweh
2005; 2005b).

155

<-----Page 169----->a functionally differentiated society has changed things decisively on the
level of the societal system, and the advanced political systems of today are
structured in an essentially different way. Complex societies are marked by
the fact that their democratic political systems actually divide into three
distinct subsystems. Democratic political systems “are based on the
threefold differentiation of politics, administration and public where
authority and command hierarchies can be completely integrated”
(Luhmann 1990, 47). Because the welfare state is a democratic political
system, it also consists of these three subsystems.
Following Luhmann, it would be correct to give up the concept of the
welfare state and examine it as a system. That is because the modern
welfare state is nothing more than a “formula of unity for the selfdescription of the political system” (Luhmann 1990, 128). The concept of
the welfare state is a paradox or fiction which the political system itself
produces in order to grasp its unity as a recursive and formally autonomous
set of communications. As noted before, the political system describes itself
as a state because communication that uses this formula is likely to be
treated as understandable. The system of the welfare state is merely a selfregulative autopoietic system for using power. In this system, power is
divided and communicated mainly between politics, administration and the
public, or more precisely, between a great number of distinct points and
distinct institutions (including legislatures, protest groups, lobbies and so
on). This type of system, in consequence, is in fact a non-hierarchical
system which consists of an enormous sequence of recursively closed
communications of power. This means that “political power loses its linearasymmetrical character of ‘from above to below’ and is brought into the
form of a cyclical dynamics” (Luhmann 1990, 48). The constant increase in
the structural complexity of the political system means that a functionalstructural internal division of the political system into distinct subsystems
becomes necessary, so that the political system is equipped for processing
all the communications which occur in it. I will next examine the way these
156

<-----Page 170----->three subsystems of the system of the welfare state are functioning
cyclically. How are they affecting each other?
First, I concentrate on the question of the relationship between politics and
administration.45 “The constant increase in the structural complexity of the
political system means that a functional-structural internal division of the
political system into distinct subsystems becomes necessary, so that the
political system is equipped to process all the communications which occur
in it” (King & Thornhill 2003, 79). Politics and administration are distinct
functional components of the political system, both of which operate under
their own autonomous criteria of rationality, and both of which develop
their own particular mechanisms for reducing complexity and processing
information. The most important function of the system of politics within a
political system is the production of collectively binding decisions. A
binding decision means that it is “collective in the sense that it binds the
decision makers themselves as well as the addressee(s) of the decision to
the selection that is made” (Luhmann 1990, 74). The production of binding
decisions is the function of ‘real politics’, by which Luhmann means
parliamentary politics. However, the system of politics cannot carry out all
of its decisions. This is where it needs bureaucratic administration (the
widest sense of legislation and government), which organises its decisions.
Or, as Luhmann (1970, 163-164; King & Thornhill 2003, 79) puts it,
administration is specialised for the “elaboration and issuing of binding
decisions, in accordance with politically prescribed criteria of correctness.”
In Luhmann’s theory all systems are autopoietic, and the same goes for
politics, administration and the public. The environmental reference
between them is possible through structural couplings or interpenetration.
Politics and administration are structurally coupled through politicians and
45

This conception of the political system which focuses on the two subsystems of politics
and administration is especially characteristic to Luhmann’s earlier works, written around
the mid-1960s. In this model politics establishes broad plans for the administration, and the
administration, deploying its own separate rationality of decision-making, gives
universalisable legal form to these plans. (King & Thornhill 2003, 87.)

157

<-----Page 171----->officials. They should not be seen here as ‘persons’ but as ‘carriers’ of
political communication. “They are the result of office-holding and/or
political behaviour”, or, “they are political data and decision premises in the
offices they exercise” (Luhmann 1990, 61).
Second, I shall give an overview of the relation between the public and
politics. It is well known that in democracy the needs and interests of the
public have an influence on the themes or binding decisions of the political
system. The public can influence the binding decisions through public
opinion and mass media, which are the structural couplings between the
public and politics. In democratic societies mass media play an important
role in representing of the public opinion. They also produce topics of
communication, which are an unavoidable requirement of communication
(Luhmann 2000d, 12). Besides, mass media produce information, which is
bound to time. “Information cannot be repeated; as soon as it becomes an
event, it becomes non-information. A new item run twice might still have
its meaning, but loses its information value.” (Luhmann 2000d, 19.) The
public needs information for being able to elect the proper candidates to the
parliament, and politicians need information about the needs and interests
of the public. The mass media are thus important structural couplings
between the public and politics.
How, then, does the relationship between the public and the administration
function? Luhmann identifies administration as the legislative component
of politics. Administration is the point of reference within the political
system, through which the current political agenda ‘communicates’ with the
public. This relation is externalised in the form of law or money. Law and
money are the structural couplings between the public and administration.
They provide the premises for binding decisions and, in this way, are able
to transfer the binding effect on these decisions (Luhmann 1990, 82). Law
and money also increase the visibility and the sensibility of changes, they
“provide external reasons for adjusting one’s behaviour to specific
conditions” (Luhmann 1990, 83). I would even argue that inclusion has
158

<-----Page 172----->developed from the basis of law and money. They have increased the
possibilities of participation in function systems like science, education and
care. The only thing that cannot be attained through law or money is the
changing of people themselves. As Luhmann (1990, 84) notes:
The whole socio-political domain that is discussed today under the title of
people changing (people processing) cannot be steered causally and
technically by means of law and money. This is true of education as well as
of concerns with social therapy, of rehabilitation measures and of the help
for individuals who cannot solve their psychical and social problems
themselves. To be sure, all professional activities within this domain
depend on law and money. But their results cannot be guaranteed by these
conditions.
Figure 8 illustrates the operations of the cyclic model of the system of the
welfare state. Some conclusions emerge from the figure. First, the system of
the welfare state can be grasped as a triadic system, which consists of three
subsystems: politics, administration and the public. Democracy, to use
Luhmann’s (1990, 125) own term, is the ultimate “title” for this triadic
system of differentiated inclusivity, in which these three subsystems
communicate with and moderate each other by the medium of power.
Secondly, these three subsystems are autopoietic and self-refential and do
not have a direct connection to each other. Therefore, in order to be able to
reduce the complexity and use the medium of power, the system of the
welfare state needs structural couplings: politicians and officers (between
politics and the administration), law and money (between the administration
and the public) and public opinion, mass media and elections46 (between
public and politics). Thirdly, this cycle does not move only in one direction.
For example, through a referendum the public can make binding decisions
and affect the operations (laws) of the administration without the
intervention of politics. Similarly, government (as a representative of the
administration) can pressure the subysystem of politics and thereby affect
the binding decisions with threats of stepping down from their positions.

2005).

The Problems of Taxing and Steering
Luhmann’s estimation of the success of the system of the welfare state is
quite skeptical. As Luhmann (1984b, 115) argues: “If we wish to
characterize the welfare state in the most extremely compressed manner, we
can talk about an overtaxing of the state by politics.” The problems of the
system of the welfare state may arise from perturbations caused either “by
the expectation of being able to guarantee a risk-free society”, or by “public
opinion demanding stricter regulation [of risky situations] than decision
makers and experts would consider rational” (Luhmann 1993, 162; see also
King & Thornhill 2003, 188-189). It seems, then, that although there is no
centre of society, the system of the welfare state is still perceived as a
centre, which can assume accountability for all kinds of concerns. This
means, first of all, that the system of the welfare state becomes the
addressee for problems which may be better addressed by other systems.
For example, it is made accountable for economic issues, whose
46

I will explore the role of elections within the system of the welfare state more closely in
the following chapters.

160

<-----Page 174----->susceptibility to regulation by political decisions is minimal. Second,
overtaxing means that the system of the welfare state itself has become
excessively inclusive, and so runs the risk of de-differentiating itself in its
relation to other systems. The system of the welfare state thus continually
self-overtaxes itself and, at the same time, undermines its own
differentiation from other subsystems. Luhmann (1990, 84-85) describes
the overtaxing effects of money and law in a following way:
In the case of money, the welfare state costs too much. It promotes
inflationary tendencies that in turn ruin it. And the clearer the selectivity of
the possibilities of the intervention of public means becomes, the more
urgent the question why one should spend so much money for this (instead
of for something else). In the case of law, the current ‘expansion of the
legal domain’ (Verrechtlichung) into many areas of living has attracted
increasing attention. So problem lies not only in the amount of rules that
one’s own problems of knowledge and application raise but also in the
question whether the boundaries of what can be handled adequately by
legal means are overstepped.
In this type of situation, both politics and administration are hopelessly
overtaxed by the regulatory burdens which are placed upon them. In the
system of the welfare state this ‘burden’ comes from the public. The needs
and interests of the public are structurally coupled with politics (as well as
with administration) via public opinion. Under these kinds of conditions the
specific subsystem of politics is forced to assume excessive accountability
for planning welfare provisions, for resolving social conflicts in the name of
welfare, and for guaranteeing social conditions likely to foster general
material security. “In order to do this, however, it is forced to employ the
administration as a tool for addressing the conflicts and problems which it
has politicised. The administration thus instrumentalised and colonised for
the processing and transmission of collectively binding decisions, becomes
overburdened by the welfare-related tasks which it is expected to execute.”
(King & Thornhill 2003, 81.)
In addition to its overburdening character, the system of the welfare state
has an uncontrollable tendency to make political legitimacy contingent on
161

<-----Page 175----->political steering – which means “the reduction of a difference” (Luhmann
1997b, 42) – and specifically on the implementation of differenceminimisation programmes between politics and the economy (see Luhmann
1988b). The system of the welfare state thus has interventionist tendencies,
especially towards the economic system. This is because “the politics of the
welfare state that promotes inclusion prefers those function systems whose
functions can be recalculated quickly and convincingly into gains for
persons or groups. These are the economy, education and the health
system.” (Luhmann 1990, 77.) From a systems-theoretical point of view,
interventionist

tendencies

cause

uncontrollable

effects.

Following

Luhmann, no politics can effectively or productively manage the economy
by directly applying power to money in the form of collectively binding
decisions. The economy can only be managed by money, by the economy
itself.
The hopes of social policy are looking for and addressee who could even
control the self-steering systems and think that it is politics. This leads to
discrepancies of theoretical, but also of highly practical and, last but not
least, of political importance, burdens the discourse between politics and
economy, and revives the idea of the 19th century that what the economy
cannot achieve (or cannot achieve satisfactorily) by self-steering must be
performed by politics. But this idea collides hard with the fact of functional
differentiation which excludes the replacement of systems by each other.
No policy can renew the economy, parts of the economy or even single
firms because for this one needs money and thus the economy. (Luhmann
1997b, 42.)
How, then, has this taxing and steering tendency of the system of the
welfare state been developed? It would be easiest to accuse the oversized
needs and interests of the public. However, we should remember that the
subsystem of public is autopoietic, and cannot thus be the only reason
behind the problems of the system of the welfare state. Rather, we must
seek answers for the problem from the perspectives of inclusion and
equality.
In the Luhmannian approach, modern society is characterised by
comprehensive inclusion of ‘persons’. This means that all members of a
162

<-----Page 176----->society have to have access to the economy, to the legal system, to religion,
to scientific knowledge, to the mass media and the political system. The
realisation of the principle of inclusion in the functional domain of politics
leads to the development of the welfare state. The system of the welfare
state is the realisation of modern political inclusion. The idea of
comprehensive inclusion, at a first sight, seems to be the solution for
problems of inequality, because modern society seems to have resolved the
problem of access and participation. But, as already analysed in chapter six,
inclusion is by no means the solution, but part of the problem. Inclusion,
although being general, is not equal. For example, a poor person is not less
included in the economical subsystem than someone with high assets, and
not to be represented politically is a special form of political inclusion.
“Inclusion does not imply equality, but rather the modern shape of
inequality can be regarded as an effect of in principle equal inclusions”
(Nassehi 2004, 6). Systems-theoretically this means that social inequality is
positioned at a right angle for functional differentiation and thus social
inequality can develop into extreme forms which can endanger the social
order. “The success of the function systems does not depend as a matter of
principle on the prevention or reduction of social inequality. Neither
economics, right and science nor religion or education has its purpose in the
problem of inequality – on the contrary all these function systems now and
then produce and enforce social inequalities.” (Nassehi 2004, 5.) However,
there is one exception: the system of the welfare state, whose operations try
to prevent the reproduction of inequality.
The “postulation of equality” in the system of the welfare state is fraudently
deployed as a device for legitimising “the steering mania of modern
society” (Luhmann 1988b, 342). Its tendency to prevent inequality leaves
the system of the welfare state as the final addressee for all tasks of crisismanagement and crisis avoidance. The differentiation of equal/unequal, and
the resultant endeavour to alter this difference via the allocation of fiscal
resources are founded on a misconception of what political systems can
actually accomplish. Wherever these principles are internalised by the
163

<-----Page 177----->system of the welfare state as programmatic directives, they lead inevitably
– via steering – to an illegitimate fusion of areas of social activity which
should remain distinct.
From the Luhmannian perspective, the system of the welfare state has tried
to create a type of inclusion which covers up inequality. In the case of
overtaxing, this means that the system of politics has made more and more
binding decisions and the administration has then externalised these by in
the form of various laws47 and social benefits. In the case of steering, the
system of the welfare state has tried to affect the inequal inclusion of other
subsystems. This has meant a reduction of difference between the system of
the welfare state and other functional systems, and created complex
problems which the system of the welfare state cannot solve. As Luhmann
(1993, 145) puts it: “This astonishing expansion of competence” or
accountability of politics in the system of the welfare state “begets a
gigantic and uncontrollable machinery for increasing risk.” The problems of
overtaxing and steering must have, then, an effect also on confidence
amidst the three subsystems: the public, politics and the administration. In
particular, we must ask: How is confidence possible between the public and
politics within the system of the welfare state?

47

It should be noted that this type of legislation cannot influence the character of the
political system. Legislations, in practice, might be seen most accurately as the gradual
reflexive adjustment, usually via slight alterations to administrative norms, or the
subsystems of politics and of administration to their own internal and external
environments, which include the public. The purpose of such legislation is always to
secure an almost motiveless, unthinking acceptance of binding decisions. As a matter of
fact, power gradually allows itself to be second-coded by law. The second-coding of power
by law in a democratic legal state does not imply that law can actually decide over power,
or that legitimacy of power hinges upon its accountability to substantively determined and
prescribed standards. (King & Thornhill 2003, 179.) In the Luhmannian political system,
politics inevitably comes before law, and law has a very limited capacity to make
prescriptions for politics (Thornhill 2000, 62).

<-----Page 178----->Confidence between the Public and Politics
As I have pointed out, to trust is to take a risk. However, situations where
we place our trust directly upon a politician as a ‘person’ are rare. Rather,
the problems of the relation between the public and the system of the
welfare state (precisely between the public and politics or the
administration) are problems of confidence.48 Yetwe can say that we do not
trust a politician. However, we must remember that he is the representative
of the system of politics, which, in turn, is characterised by the fact that
politics is more about the need for guidance than for other possibilities of
action. The politician must, therefore, say more than he can do. “This
situation results from the differentiation of systems, more exactly from the
fact that the political system is a subsystem of society that is constituted
along with society but sees it from the perspective of a social function and
cannot control it” (Luhmann 1990, 111). Therefore, this type of
untrustworthy politician must here be seen as a representative of the
overtaxed and steering-oriented system of the welfare state, not as an
untrustworthy ‘person’ with whom we have (had) a mutual relationship.
However, the overtaxing and steering of the system of the welfare state
have increased the need for confidence because they have also entailed
more risks.
The society of risk knows no heros and no masters. It also discontinues the
traditional forms of reciprocity. It replaces the mechanism of
aid/gratitude/aid by the organization of the welfare state, thus engendering a
climate of rights in which far more help is provided than before – and at the
same time disappointment increases. (Luhmann 1990, 102.)
Luhmann (1993) makes a division between decision makers and those
affected. In the case of the system of the welfare state, decision makers
belong to the subsystem of politics because they make binding decisions.
Respectively, the subsystem of public here plays the role of those affected.
48
Luhmann was already in his early work convinced that in the context of politics we
cannot use the term trust. He emphasised that the place of trust as a conceptual category
has here been taken by support. (Luhmann 1979, 54.)

165

<-----Page 179----->Because of this, politicians take risks when they make binding decisions. In
taking risks, they trust that they can manage these risks. The public cannot
directly affect this risk-taking process. For the public, the same risk
presents itself as a danger. As Luhmann (1993, 107) puts it:
The risks the decision maker takes and has to take become a danger for
those affected. Within the decision making process itself, one cannot avoid
attributing consequences to decisions (otherwise the decision would not be
recognizable as a decision). Thus one can also not avoid an attribution of
future loss and has to accept it as risk where it cannot be entered under
costs. The affected party finds himself in a quite different situation. He sees
himself as endangered by decisions that he neither makes himself nor
controls. Self-attribution is not possible for him. He is dealing with dangers
– even when he sees and reflects that, from the point of view of the decision
maker (perhaps himself!), it is a matter of risk.
The public’s confidence in politics is systems-theoretically dependent on
the binding decisions, or more precisely, the dangers which these decisions
establish. Decisions which create many dangerous situations for the public
are not convenient for the success and confidence of decision makers.
Although the public cannot affect the binding decisions, it is able to
evaluate risks and the possibilities of averting or managing them. In the
system of the welfare state, the public can indirectly affect decisions and
risks via elections.49 Elections are forms of communication for the
(cognitive) decisions of confidence. In other words, through elections
decisions (of confidence) socialise themselves. It must be mentioned that
this type of confidence cannot be similar with the ‘early’ Luhmannian
system trust, which “hardly becomes an open matter for public discussion”
(Luhmann 1979, 57). Rather, the public can through elections (see Figure 7)
express its confidence in politics and have some influence on the majority
of the decision makers. Or, as Luhmann (1979, 55) puts it: “The citizen
49
Again, it is important to note the concept of time. Luhmann observes the important part
that time plays in risk management. Political time is not the same as economic or legal
time. The sequence of decisions within politics, according to Luhmann (1993, 165), “is
punctuated by the [specific] time structures of the political system – for example, by the
rhythm of elections, the legislative periods, the stability or instability of governments.”
These structures also determine “the foreseeable consumption of time by the process of
making decisions and seeking consensus” (Luhmann 1993, 165), which may be

166

<-----Page 180----->cherishes certain expectations about what will be decided, possibly about
what concerns himself or about the style of politics he favours, and he can
use his vote as an expression of overall disappointment or satisfaction”.
Public opinion largely defines the programs of politics, which in turn are
based on the codes of politics: government and opposition.
[Politics is coded] according to government and opposition depending on
whether political groups enjoy a parliamentary majority, occupy the
presidency and other important governments offices or not…Holding such
offices is contingent, a process of selecting persons and programs and is
under continual examination. Political election and the formation of
governments serve to bring the code and program into agreement for a
certain amount of time, i.e., to hand over the government to those who
personally and professionally seem to offer the guarantee of carrying out
the preferred political programs. This presupposes a structural uncoupling
of code and program, i.e., the possibility of opening access to other
programs. (Luhmann 1989, 86.)
The contingent character of politics is connected with risks. If politics and
administration have been able to manage the apparent risks, the decision
makers quite probably succeed in keeping their positions. However, if
binding decisions – elaborated and issued by the administration – have
caused dangerous situations for the public, the situation is different. In this
type of a situation, confidence in the functions of politics cannot be very
high but there is an ‘order’ to new risk-taking (welfare) programs. In the
system of the welfare state, the public’s confidence in politics is dependent
on the functions of the latter. Systems-theoretically, this type of confidence
goes thus hand in hand with risk-taking binding decisions, which can
reduce complexity and make living less dangerous. Confidence gives the
public a relatively stable attitude towards that which is contingent in a
complex system of the welfare state, makes it live with the realisation that
politics (as well as administration) could also be arranged otherwise.
Confidence is also tightly bound to the legitimacy of the political system. A
fundamental function of the entire political system, and especially of the
manipulated by strategic devices of urgency and delay, but only within politically

167

<-----Page 181----->administration in the political system is, Luhmann (1970, 159) argues, “to
ensure the acceptance of still indeterminate, random decisions – thus, to
ensure the legitimacy of legality.” In other words, the content of legislation
is established prior to legislation, and legislation has to make acceptable
legal sense of this content. “The political system is legitimate,
consequently, wherever it can pass its rulings off as legitimate: wherever
these decisions act as trusted and accepted universal motives for obedience”
(King & Thornhill 2003, 181). Confidence between the public and politics
is, thus, largely affected by the administration, since “administration is the
place where virtual forms of legitimacy can become virtually valid laws,
and as such it is the defining point in the operations [and trustworthiness] of
the political system” (King & Thornhill 2003, 181).
Moreover, we must remember that politics (as well as the administration) is
a self-referential system. Through socialised confidence expressed by
elections (or public opinion), politics is capable of observing itself. I would
call this a type of a mirror effect. The mirror of elections and public opinion
makes the observation of observers possible. As Luhmann (1990, 216) puts
it: “As a social system the political system, accordingly, uses public opinion
to make itself capable of observing itself and developing corresponding
expectational structures.” Confidence expressed via elections thus serves
the self-referential closure of the system of the welfare state, especially the
return of politics upon itself.
In the end, the public cannot know how the system of politics uses its
power and vice versa. Power arises under the condition of double
contingency on both sides of relations. This means that for the politicians
who have power, as well as for the public who is subordinate to it, the
relation must be defined so that both could act otherwise. Thus, there is a
situation of doubly double contingency. (Luhmann 1990, 156.) In this type
of circumstances, the public can only assume that politicians would behave
in a specific way. In other words, the public can only have confidence in
acceptable limits.

168

<-----Page 182----->them – in no terms could their actions be predictable and familiar. Neither
can politicians be sure that they will be re-elected. They just can have
confidence in the public and hope that they have not caused too many
dangerous situations.
What makes the concept of confidence between the public and politics
theoretically even more complex is the growing role of administration and
mass media. As noted above, it is the performances of law and money that
operate as structural couplings between administration and public. These
performances externalise the binding effect for the public. Therefore, these
performances play a vital role in building the relations of confidence
between the public and politics, although they have been produced by the
administration. Law and money have an influence on the public’s behaviour
and, consequently, also their confidence in politics. Similarly, the mass
media – which is a forceful system behind opinion building – and the
information it produces affects the public opinion. It seems, then, that
double contingency is not enough, but needs to make way for a more
adequate replacement, namely, triple contingency50 (see Strydom 1999, 11).
In addition to the public and politics, there is a third perspective, borne by
the administration and especially by mass media, which observes what the
public and politics are doing (communicating). By so doing, either the mass
media or the administration has a constitutive impact on the social situation,
and thus also on confidence between the public and politics.
To sum up briefly, confidence between the public and politics socialises
itself in the form of elections. The public’s confidence in politics is
systems-theoretically dependent of the latter’s risk-taking binding decisions

50
By the concept of triple contingency, Piet Strydom (1999) emphasises the role of public
communication, which embodies the societal power of definition. Public communication
defines the communicational situation between I and Thou. From the Luhmannian point of
view, the public is not the central force in the definition of power or reality. Moreover,
there is no such concept as public communication. Triple contingency, from the
Luhmannian perspective, means that there is also a third ‘black box’ which, one way or
another, affects the process of ongoing communication.

169

<-----Page 183----->that succeed in reducing complexity. Through socialised confidence,
politics is capable of observing itself, or its success in reducing complexity.
Because of double (or triple) contingency, confidence has become a very
important element for stabilising the complex power relations between the
public, politics and administration (and even the mass media).
After studying the theory of the welfare state and the functions of
confidence between the subsystems of the public and politics, I will next
analyse the functions of trust and confidence in and between organisations
and institutions. In the time of functional differentiation, it is evident that
we are more dependent on various organisations and institutions than
before. Furthermore, because of differentiation, organisations and
institutions need each other to be capable of answering the challenges of
growing complexity.
In the case of the system of the welfare state, organisations play an
important role, especially within the subsystem of administration. Luhmann
calls these organisations bureaucracy. The bureaucratic organisations are a
result of the requirements, placed upon the political system, to offer
performances outside those areas organised by collectively binding
decisions. The rights of the public can be conditioned with the help of
bureaucracy (Luhmann 1990, 88). In the complex and overtaxed systems of
the welfare states there are several organisations which have to work
together. Therefore, organisations also have to trust each other. How, then,
does the advanced trust between organisations function?

The Decisions of Trust between Organisations
Luhmann wrote two books directly discussing organisation theory:
Funktionen und Folgen formaler Organisation (1964) and Organisation
und Entscheidung (2000e). Luhmann characterises organisations as a third
type of social systems (the others are society and interaction). In
Luhmann’s theory, the concept of organisation is relatively extensive. It
170

<-----Page 184----->includes businesses as well as organisations connected to politics, along
with the systems of law, education, economy, religion, and the system of
care (which I will examine later), which are usually referred to as
institutions and administrations. Furthermore, voluntary organisations must
be included within the concept of organisation. Companies, institutions and
voluntary organisations are thus seen as variants of the social form of
organisation (Jönnhill 2003, 25). I would say that organisations are the
visible (organic and social) forms of function systems. Or, as Nassehi
(2005, 12) puts it: “From Luhmann we learn that function systems are only
structured by the connectivity of specially coded communications, but that
empirical

reality

of

such

function

systems

is

characterized

by

organizations”. We generally identify the different function systems by
means of organisational manifestations rather than their media and codes.
We identify the economic system as the sphere of corporations, banks, etc.,
and the political system (in this study particularly the system of the welfare
state) is identified by parties and governments, for example.
According to Luhmann (2000e), any form of organisation has four criteria
through which it functions: membership, program, location and staff, and
decisions. Any organisation may always decide whether or not a person
belongs to it. Organisations always have definite, delimited goals
‘compacting’ communication through the conditioning of a person’s
behaviour and acting on the basis of roles. To realise their programmes,
organisations have competent persons at specified positions. The function of
the organisation is to make and execute decisions; the most important
function of an organisation is decision-making. “Organisation systems
continue themselves by connecting decisions to decision. Therefore
organisations can be designated as decision machines” (Nassehi 2005, 9).
As a matter of fact, through decision-making the organisation determines
the other three criteria. Before a decision is made, there is considerable
contingency and uncertainty, in other words, there are other possibilities.
After the decision is made, either the contingency and uncertainty have
dissipated, or the other possibilities remain. Although the decision is made
171

<-----Page 185----->here and now, previous decisions affect it. “On the whole, decisions can
only be made on the basis of other decisions. As organized events decisions
thus cannot occur as individual events”. (Jönnhill 2003, 27.) An
organisation that no longer makes decisions ceases to be an organisation.
What, then, does decision mean in the context of organisations? As
mentioned above, in Luhmann’s theory, a decision is not understood as a
psychological mechanism, but as a matter of communication, not as a
psychological event in the form of an internally conscious definition of the
self, but as a social event. That makes it impossible to state that decisions
already

taken

still

have

to

be

communicated.

Decisions

are

communications; something that clearly does not preclude that one can
communicate about decisions. Everything depends on what is explicitly or
implicitly drawn upon when a decision is made. There is no such thing as
an independent reality that may influence an organisation directly. As a
closed system for decision-making, an organisation may only be defined on
the basis of its own decisions. (Luhmann 2003, 32-33.) As a matter of fact,
“the rationality of organizations is their ability to concentrate the allocation
both of goods and observable decisions” (Nassehi 2005, 13).
For Luhmann, decision-making is a form of communication that limits
contingency. Its function is, thus, to reduce or reconstruct the complexity of
the organisation. As Jönnhill (2003, 27) notes: Decisions are made “in what
could be designated a contingency room: before the decision is made, this
room is open, or in other words there are other possibilities; after the
decision is made it is closed, or in other words there were other
possibilities.” For being able to reduce complexity, organisations must
make their decisions under some kinds of rules or through different forms
of compilations (Zusammenfassung). In the words of Herbert Simon (1949),
one might talk about different forms whereby the “premises for decisionmaking” are established (Luhmann 2000e). Through these decision
premises a certain control of the decision process is made possible. This
control is something the organisation (obviously) itself decides upon
172

<-----Page 186----->(Jönnhill 2003, 27). In the case of administration, Luhmann (1990, 96) calls
the premises for steering the bureaucratic organisations planning. “Planning
is a specific way of producing a self-description of the system. In planning
this self-description is oriented toward the future”. (Luhmann 1995, 471.)
Therefore, by planning, the bureaucratic organisations of the system of the
welfare state, for example, try to rationalise their decisions concerning to
the performances of law and money.
On the whole, decisions can only be made on the basis of other decisions
within the same system, and organisations are thus established through
decisions. Every organisation also has its own premises for decisionmaking. Membership is decided through decisions, the program of an
organisation is formulated in decisions, and the locations and staff are
appointed through decisions by decision-qualified persons. (See Jönnhill
2003, 28.) Through decisions, organisations produce also a special kind of
rationality and make themselves visible. That is to say, by observing the
decisions of organisations we are also somehow able to ‘observe’ the
function systems, which by themselves are unobservable. This exemplifies
the reason why bureaucracy plays a vital role in the system of the welfare
state. It is bureaucracy that offers visible performances outside those areas
organised by collectively binding decisions. The rationality of organisations
is their ability to concentrate the allocation of both goods and of observable
decisions.
The accountability of organizations makes the structure of function systems
observable - not that function systems can become really observable, but in
terms of a special kind of getting some accountable informations about
economy, politics, religion, art, or the legal order. If we want to observe
function systems, we usually observe organizations, states and their
organizations as the political system, decisions of courts as the legal
systems, decisions and strategies of firms and companies as the economic
systems and so on. (Nassehi 2004, 10.)
Although Luhmann does not speak extensively about trust (or familiarity
and confidence) between organisations, it seems quite obvious that
organisational

decision-making

would
173

be

impossible

without

<-----Page 187----->interorganisational trust. This is because organisations are the dominating
and most effective forms for fulfilling functions in almost all functionally
differentiated subsystems. Furthermore, organisations may also operate
between the function systems, and thus contribute in reconciling problems
connected to their autonomy, chiefly in the form of negotiating systems.
Because of their autopoietic character, organisations’ negotiations are not
always simple and risk-free.
This communication towards the outside presupposes autopoiesis on the
basis of decisions. Internally, communication can only be produced within
the recursive network of decisional activity, i.e. only as decision, otherwise
it could not be recognised as [the organisation’s] own communication.
Communication with the outside thus does not contradict the system’s
operative closure; to the contrary, it presumes it. This also explains quite
well why organisations’ communications are often flattened to become
nearly meaningless or exhibit other specifics which are often quite
surprising for their environment and can hardly be understood. (Luhmann
1997, 834.)
In today’s world – especially within the area of the system of the welfare
state – we are dependent on different organisations and in one way or
another, we must have confidence in them and consider them trustworthy.
Similarly, organisations are dependent on one another. A personorganisation relationship is not the same as an organisation-organisation
relationship. In Luhmannian language, organisational decisions do not
directly have any individual qualities.51 Organisation systems are not
systems that are based on the mutual and immediate recognition of persons,
but systems which have to make their decision-making processes visible
(Nassehi 2005, 11; Luhmann 2000e, 149). Of course, organisations can be
said to do things, say things and believe things in the sense that some or all
their members do, say, or believe these things. It is also true that were there
51
Already the ‘early’ Luhmann was aware of this. He says that “organization in no way
makes trust and distrust superfluous but it depersonalizes these mechanisms. The person
who trusts no longer does so at his own risk but at the risk of the system; all he has to do is
to take care still that no detectable mistakes creep into his own trusting”. (Luhmann 1979,
93.) But, as can be noted, this argument cannot be valid in the context of advanced systems
theory, because, here, Luhmann has not yet explicated the difference between psychic and
social systems, nor developed the threefold concept of communication. In any case, the

174

<-----Page 188----->no individuals to act as members of organisations, there would be no
organisations. But as we have seen, organisations are built of decisions, not
by individuals. One reason why organisations are not reducible to their
members is that organisations survive changes in their membership. If a
member dies or leaves, an organisation (such as a parliament or an old
people’s home) persists almost the same. Not only are organisations
logically distinct from their members; they differ psychologically and
sociologically as well. The properties and attributes of organisations are not
simply those of individuals. Thinking that we can reduce the sentiments
within an organisation to those of individuals is incorrect, because one
thereby ignores the fact that some of the sentiments of individuals may arise
simply because they are members of these organisations and participate in
the organisations’ activities, sharing the organisations’ sense of its history
and culture. We also have to remember that in Luhmann’s theory,
individuals are not parts of society but of its environment. They can thus be
understood as parts of organisations but they are not those elements of
organisations which affect society, only decisions are.
The organisational frameworks for deliberation and decision-making are
important factors for discussing trust between organisations. When
organisations have clear procedures and strategies for decision-making, the
‘determination’ of the organisation will be manifested, and constituted, by
statements and decisions. If an organisation decides to trust another
organisation, this trust emerges through a decision. In other words, an
organisation decides to trust another one to be better equipped to reduce
complexity. In this case, the risk involved is quite often higher than that
involved in personal trust relationships. Organisational trust decisions
concern wider populations than mutual trust decisions. Organisational trust
cannot, thus, be built up by a single human being, and its emergence is a
much larger process than processes leading to personal trust decisions.
Trust ascribed to an organisation has the same sense and interpretations as it
concept of organisation explored here seems to be valid even in the context of advanced
systems theory.

175

<-----Page 189----->does for individuals, although the phenomena described are more complex,
and it would be harder to gather evidence to confirm a statement to the
effect that one organisation trusts another (see Govier 1997, 202).52
Furthermore, the discontinuity of life also stresses the importance of trust in
the operations of organisations. An organisation might make some
decisions, which cause risky situations to another organisation. After that, it
is the latter organisation’s turn to decide whether it should continue to trust
the first one or not. This situation is typical in today’s world, where
organisations are continuously under influence of new and strange
organisations. In addition to this, organisations’ functioning principles have
changed. They are now polyphonic, have many functions and are linked to
many subsystems. These are the reasons why long-lasting processes have
become more difficult and the need for risk-taking trust decisions has
grown. Sinde decision-making is a social event, it can happen only once.
Decisions produce new decisions which can be totally different from the
earlier ones. Decision-making is not a process but an event. Trust, in
Luhmannian thinking, is not a continued state similar to that implied by
Parsons and Giddens (see Jalava 2001; 2003). The trusting relationship
reached between organisations is not continuous but has to be rebuilt again
and again. Thus, we should also reckon with the possibility of mistrust
because there is always the possibility that the world which we take for
granted gets turned upside down. Continuity may turn into discontinuity,
just as trust may turn into mistrust. This is why ‘process’ needs to be
52
It can be said that in the context of organisations, trust is more strongly connected to the
concept of contract than in the interpersonal context. The term ‘contract’ is used here in
reference to devices for conducting exchanges. According to Stewart Macaulay (1963, 56),
“contract involves two distinct elements: (a) Rational planning of the transaction with
careful provision for as many future contingencies as can be foreseen, and (b) the existence
or use of actual or potential legal sanctions to induce performance of the exchange or to
compensate for non-performance.” Trust decisions between organisations are one way or
another connected to planning and contingency, but these decisions are not by themselves
bound to potential legal sanctions. However, the process of creating trust between
organisations is often enforced as formal and juridical contracts, which in turn are bound to
sanctions. From a Luhmannian point of view, it even seems that these types of
relationships no longer contain the risks that are present in ‘pure’ trust relationships.
Therefore, I would say that organisational relations based on contracts are more tightly
connected with confidence towards the authorities which enforce legal sanctions than with
trust.

176

<-----Page 190----->supplemented by ‘event’. Process largely expresses continuity while events
allow for discontinuity. Or, as Luhmann (2000e, 26) says: “Process is to
event as continuity is to discontinuity.”
Similarly, I would like to remark that familiarity can be to trust as
continuity is to discontinuity. In some cases, familiarity and processes are
important for organisations. In the circumstances where organisations have
a long collaboration history and are engaged in continuous processes with
one another, we must talk about familiar or established practices and cooperation. This type of interorganisational co-operation is not so much
linked with new risk taking decisions and the need for trust, but refers to
operating in a familiar world. However, familiar co-operation can be seen
as a precondition for interorganisational trust and confidence. In the case of
organisations, we cannot talk about confidence, which would be connected
to psychic systems or consciousness. This is because organisations cannot
have mental states. Rather, organisations’ decision-making processes are
based on the principles of the subsystems’ functional communication.
Organisations’ confidence in subsystems’ functions can be seen as built-in
elements of the organisations’ decision-making processes.
The public, politics and the administration as well as the numerous
organisations they consist of and are affected by, have influenced the
further differentiation of the system of the welfare state. In the next chapter,
I shall study one such modern functional subsystem, the differentiation of
which is largely affected by the welfare state (the public, politics, the
administration and organisations). My aim is to examine whether the
differentiation and the functions of the system of care (the duty of which in
general is to help ‘people’) can be adapted to the context of Luhmannian
systems theory. Care, when viewed as a secondary social system, is also
surrounded by the problems of trust and confidence.

177

<-----Page 191----->8. Care as Communication, Organisation and
Interaction – Trust and the Luhmannian Subsystem
of Care
In this chapter I consider care, especially care of the elderly, as a functional
subsystem of society, which has been built over the years in the modern
welfare state. My hypothesis is that care consists of three important
elements: communication, organisations and interaction. It should be noted
that organisations also consists of communication, whilst interaction
consists of communication and perception. This is because in Luhmann’s
systems theory there are three social systems: society (consisting functional
subsystems), interaction and organisation. But by using communication as
an element of care I wish to lay special emphasis on communication at the
level of the subsystem of care. I also address the connections between trust,
confidence and the systems-theoretical model of care. Before going in
greater depth into the possible Luhmannian model of care, I briefly set it in
context by overviewing some influential theories of care.

Realms of care
Theories of care have been discussed since the 1970s, and in the 1980s the
study of care was of particular interest to feminist scholars. British feminist
researchers theorised the problems and structures of family (informal)
caring. In the Nordic countries, on the other hand, the study of care has
mainly emphasised the conceptualisation and structural importance of the
professional (formal) model of care. Early Scandinavian feminist analyses
of social policy argued that the entry of women into jobs in day care
centres, schools, hospitals and old people’s homes – in the service of the
welfare state – represented a form of ‘public patriarchy’ (see Siim 1987).
Women were now doing work in the public sphere that they had
traditionally carried out at home.
178

<-----Page 192----->Over time, the concept of care was broadened to reflect both the changing
nature of caring in practice and the complexity introduced by the
increasingly comparative nature of scholarship. There are two basic
approaches in the modern study of care. The first has concentrated on moral
questions at an abstract theoretical level (see Ungerson 1990; Graham
1991). The vast majority of work in this area focusses on relations among
humans and the influence of societal structures on these relations (see
Tronto 1993). The second approach is empirical and firmly linked to
practice. Here, care has been studied from the perspective of the so-called
social service state, and approaches have been developed in an attempt to
cover both caregivers’ and patients’ viewpoints (see Waerness 2000; Sipilä
2003).
In British discussion, the distinction has been made between medical care
and social care. The public sector, or the welfare state, is responsible for
medically prescribed care. Social care, on the other hand, refers to everyday
forms of care that are not medically determined. Social care belongs to the
area of everyday routines and communication, and is a multi-dimensional
concept. Of its different dimensions, particularly three merit emphasis: care
as labour, care within a normative framework of obligation and
responsibility, and care as activity that has costs both financial and
emotional, which extend across public/private boundaries (Daly and Lewis
2000, 85). This three-dimensional approach leads us to define social care as
the activities and relations involved in meeting the physical and emotional
requirements of dependent adults and children, and the normative,
economic and social frameworks within which these are assigned and
carried out.
From the caregiver’s perspective, care basically means providing for the
continuation of bodily existence (Tedre 2001). This lateral thinking has
been inspired by the theory of the body revived in the 1990s. It conceives
care in terms of physical work, physical encounters and close bodily
contact. From the Luhmannian point of view this lateral thinking
179

<-----Page 193----->emphasises the importance of organic systems. This approach stresses the
fact that caring for the elderly (among others) is physically very demanding
work. In other words, good will, professional knowledge and a warm heart
are not enough to solve the problems of everyday care. Rather, it is the
physical body of the caregiver which determines the possible alternative
ways for care (Tedre 2001, 182).
According to Carol Thomas (1993, 667), the concept of care is problematic
in sociological research because it has been inconsistently defined and thus
it means different things to different researchers, and because not enough
theoretical work has been done on the relationship between different forms
of care. In this work, a new interpretation of ‘care’ and caring will be
developed as we discuss the concept of care from the perspective of
Luhmann’s systems theory. I shall show how can care be conceived of as a
subsystem of society, and how such a system functions. Finally, I shall, in
the light of this analysis, deliberate upon whether it is more fruitful to
conceive of care as a functional subsystem or, rather, as an organisation
conditioned by primary subsystems.

Differentiation and the Medium of Modern Care
The emergence of the concept of modern care is here linked to the
evolution of the welfare state and the idea of new caring professions. As a
matter of fact, care itself is historically not a new phenomenon. In Western
history, an obvious connection can be found between the concepts of
culture and care. As Luhmann (1980) notes, Greek and Roman cultures had
been, among other things, expressions of care, attention, and worship, as
documented in phrases like cultura animi, Cicero’s name for philosophy, or
cultura dolorum, an expression used for the Christian faith.
The evolution of social policy dramatically changed the notion of care.
Through public funding, welfare states have enhanced the operations of
systems of care. Caring is an essential part of social policy in modern
180

<-----Page 194----->welfare states. As said before, the welfare state is characterised most often
as a state that supplies extensive social benefits to particular classes of the
population and consequently must find constant sources of revenue for this
purpose. This type of characterisation is connected intensively with
economic growth. As noted in the previous chapter, diverging from this
traditional approach, Niklas Luhmann formulates his concept of the welfare
state with the help of the sociological principle of inclusion. Furthermore,
in this work the welfare state is viewed as a triadic system, which consists
of the public, politics and administration. The concept of the welfare state is
itself a paradox or a fiction. For these reasons, I would not say that care
would be a result of the differentiation of welfare state. Rather, the
differentiation of the modern system of care is bound to the communication
of the public, politics and administration.
The differentiation of the modern system of care has largely been
dependent on the binding decisions made by politics within the system of
the welfare state. Behind these binding decisions the are needs and interests
of the public. Furthermore, binding decisions have been externalised in the
forms of law and money. From this point of view, through this cyclic model
of the system of the welfare state, a modern system of care has gradually
differentiated. It has an own specific function and symbolic medium, which
are not directly affected by the public, politics or administration (or other
subsystems of society).
The symbolically generalised media establish all communicative codes that
demarcate communication at the level of facts. Without these codes, the
development or differentiation of the subsystems would be impossible. A
code is understood as a basic and unambiguous binary preference in which
a distinction is made between a positive and a negative value. In relation to
the medium of the system of care, the code is to help/not to help. Not to
help can here be seen as equal to a lack of need for care. In general, help
can also be associated with many other things than caring. For example, a
professor can lend a book for a student or we can ask advice from the locals
181

<-----Page 195----->when lost in a strange city. Help can be spontaneous, connected to moral
preferences or an organised program. In any case, its essential intention is
to neutralise the needs of the target of help (Luhmann 1973, 22).
According to Luhmann (1973, 32), from an evolutionary point of view, one
can distinguish between three types of help. Firstly, in archaic societies help
was directly connected to societal interdependencies. Secondly, in high
cultural societies help was based on general and morally oriented structures
of expectations. These types of societies were class societies, where help
was based on laws and charity. Thirdly, functionally differentiated societies
must have other ways to characterise help than interdependency, morals or
charity. In these societies the needs for help are affected by functional
subsystems. This is because functional subsystems can also weaken the
inclusion or participation of ‘people’. For example, the economy can incur
unemployment and homelessness. This type of society needs organised
functional subsystems, which are specialised for helping or sustaining
inclusion. In other words, the function of these systems is to prevent
exclusion and seek means for re-inclusion through helping programs.53
Functionalised help is not, then, bound (only) to individual motives but to
professional interventions and programs as well (see Luhmann 1973, 34).
These types of systems can also be called “secondary function systems”
(sekundäres Funktionssysteme) because they enter into problems produced
by primary function systems (Primärsysteme). As Luhmann (1997, 633)
puts it: “One cannot expect that the problem [of exclusion] can be solved by
[primary] function systems. Rather, we should be prepared to build a new,
secondary function system, which is specialised in the consequences of

53
According to Dirk Baecker (1994, 100), one such system, specialised to prevent
exclusion, is the system of social work, the binary code of which is also help/not help
(Hilfe/Nicht-Hilfe). However, the system of social work may be better understood through
the code fall/not fall (Fall/Nicht-Fall) developed by Peter Fuchs (2000). On the whole, this
latter code expresses better the reasons why the system of social work is needed or
differentiated. Through this code it becomes obvious that the other subsystems have made
‘people’ fall into the area of the system of social work. Social work produces new chances
(Möglichkeiten) for these fallen ‘people’.

182

<-----Page 196----->exclusion.” 54 The emergence of this type of systems can also be linked to a
new type of specialist-client relationships. In this type of systems, inclusion
is achieved through interaction wherein the specialist expresses himself
through general symbolic codes, which have a specific professional
function (Stichweh 2005b, 21).
The modern system of care is an example of such (secondary) systems,
which are specialised in the consequences of exclusion and for sustaining
inclusion. Care is the form of this system. The medium of this system is need
for help, since care operations are formed to meet the needs of help caused
by other subsystems. Niels Andersen (2003, 163) characterises the
communication of the modern system of care in the following way:
[If the symbolically generalised medium for a decision is need for help,] the
organisational environment immediately emerges in the shape of needs that
require specification. The decisions of the system of care become
diagnostic and pertain usually to the specification of unspecified needs and
interests of public (but also other subsystems). Care communication
systematically designates new demands for methodical intervention, and
decisions about care become decisions about this kind of intervention.
Although the programs of care are changing all the time (for example, there
are new professional requirements for caregivers and new needs of
patients), the only medium of communication through which the
reproduction and self-reference of the care system is possible is the need for
help, the binary code of which is to help/not to help. In other words, the
inclusion realises itself through interactive caring professions. The
environmental changes of the care system are usually affected by the
system of the welfare state – for example, the development of public health
care and subsistence subsidies – have radically influenced today’s model of
54
Rudolf Stichweh (2005, 7) goes even further than Luhmann by arguing that “one
specificity of modern society consists of the exclusions it effects nearly always being
transformed into inclusions of another kind. Prisons and corrective educational institutions,
psychiatric wards and old people’s homes are examples for institutions which are
specialized on institutionalizing exclusions in ways which intend to effect new
inclusions…There seems to be nearly no way to escape the inclusive grip of world society
and this may be responsible for the reversibility of all exclusions as well as inclusions to be
observed in this system which has no social environment anymore.”

183

<-----Page 197----->the care system. On the one hand, the changes have pared down the
functions of the traditional care systems (interdependency, moral and
charity) but, on the other, they have created a more specialised and
professionalised care system, the duty of which is to help/not help children
and adults (especially the elderly).
I will next specify the elements of contemporary care organisations which
specialise in taking care of the elderly. It should be noted here that the
system of care for the elderly is quite exceptional because the ‘persons’ it
encompasses do not directly need help because of their weakened inclusion
within the functional subsystems (economy, law or science etc,). Basically,
they need help because of their deteriorating organic and psychic systems.
Of course, this quite often consequentially leads to weakened inclusion
within the functional subsystems.

Care as Organisation
One way to approach the practices and functions of the care system is to
examine it as an organisation. It is through organisations that care within
the system of the welfare state reaches its systemic status in society. In the
same way that politics needs governments and ministries or the economy
needs financial institutions to make decisions and reproduce their
communication media (power and money), care also needs different
organisations (e.g. old people’s homes) where decision-making and the
reproducing of its communication media (need for help) is possible. Care
organisations such as old people’s homes or informal voluntary associations
specialised in taking care of the elderly are thus also established through
decisions. Membership – those who are eligible or ineligible for care – is
decided through decision-making. The program of the care organisation –
how to provide care for the elderly – is similarly formulated. Location and
staff – the latter fulfilling the professional and educational standards for
taking care of the elderly – are designated and appointed through decisions
made by qualified persons. Nonetheless, we must remember that every
184

<-----Page 198----->decision in an organisation is based upon other decisions. For example, the
programme of a care organisation is tightly bound to the composition of the
staff. The more specialised social workers and nurses the organisation has,
the greater its means for taking care of patients.
The subsystems (law, the economy, politics etc.) are directly independent of
each other, but intensely dependent on organisations that constitute their
institutional backbone (Luhmann 2000e). However, organisations may also
operate between the function systems, and thus contribute to reconciling
problems connected to their autonomy, chiefly in the form of negotiating
systems. No function system may consist of only one organisation (see
Jönnhill 2003, 28-29). The system of care, likewise, consists of many
different caring organisations. Furthermore, the same caring organisations
could also operate between the different function systems – for example,
care and economy – and work, then, through the medium of need for help
as well as that of money. In practice, a nurse who belongs to the staff of an
organisation can help a patient who is unable to walk by moving him in his
wheelchair. In this case the medium of communication is need for help
(help/not help). But if the director of the organisation has refused to buy
wheelchairs, because of budgetary constraints, the nurse cannot help the
patient by moving him in a wheelchair. In this case the medium of
communication is money (have/not have).
Today, there are a growing number of organisations – for example caring
organisations – that no longer have a primary connection to a single
function. Andersen (2003, 167) calls these kinds of organisations
polyphonic:
An organization is polyphonic when it is connected to several function
systems without a predefined primary function systems…the polyphonic
organization emerges as a result of the way that the function systems
explode beyond their organizational forms. In this context explosion means
that the function systems expand their themes without leaving their
operational closure, they expand what was included as political,
economical, juridical, pedagogical etc. Themes, including organizations, are
185

<-----Page 199----->articulated, based on the code of the function systems. What happens is that
the symbolically generalized communication media become available to a
much greater number of communication forms that originally employed by
the functionally related forms.
This type of explosion has occurred also in the sphere of care. In the
developed welfare states (such as Finland and Sweden), four different
models of providing care can be found (see Sipilä 2003, 29). The first one is
informal care, which has always been important. The provider of care, in
this case, is a family member, a relative or a close friend. We could say that
the informal model represents a traditional form of care. It is more
homophonic (linked firmly to the primary codification: help/not help) than
polyphonic. Informal care is surely – at least in the case of the family –
linked also to feelings of intimacy and love (see more Luhmann 1998).
Secondly, there is the formal or public model, more complex than the
informal one. Here the provider is a municipality and the care services are
meant only for its inhabitants (the taxpayers) who need them. The care is
dispensed by professionals and controlled by the public administration. The
public model of care is thus polyphonic: the media of politics (power:
govern/governed), the economy (money: pay/not pay or have/not have),
jurisdiction (law: legal/not legal or lawful/unlawful) as well as of care (need
for help: help/not help) are all involved. Third is the commercial model,
offered by companies and primarily bound to the media of the economy and
care. It is meant for people who are able to buy it. Fourth is the voluntary
model of care, received through voluntary action. This model is also
polyphonic. It consists of the media of care, the economy, as well as that of
law, which controls the structure and activity of the voluntary association.
In spite of the multiplicity of the models of care organisations, it is either
families or the public administration that are liable to provide the elderly
with care.
However, the explosion and universality of the function systems have not
led to the dissolution of their boundaries. The care system is still
autopoietic, closed and reproduced only by itself. In other words, the care
186

<-----Page 200----->system is produced and reproduced by professional care communication.
Organisational polyphony implies more links between function systems,
organisations being these links. They can be seen as structural couplings of
the system, through which the system can respond to the demands and
actions of the environment. Still, a direct connection between system and
environment is impossible. A polyphonic organisation is one that describes
itself through many codes and not just one (unlike function systems). In
other words, an organisation chooses first in which subsystem’s context it
would function, and then communicates in order of the code by the chosen
subsystem.
To summarise, the differentiation of the care system is intimately linked to
the communication of the public, politics and administration, which in turn
has developed the type of inclusion that encompasses ‘people’ who cannot
carry out their daily routines by themselves. Inclusion is maintained here
through specialised and interactive caring professions, which are tied to the
medium and code of the care system. The medium of the care system is
need for help and the primary code is to help/not help. Although the care
system is always autopoietic (it reproduces itself through its own elements)
it consists of different organisations (among other things). The fact that
makes organisations visible and societal is their ability to make decisions.
Through decisions, organisations determine their membership, location and
staff, and programme criteria. Today, a function system cannot consist of
merely one organisation, and care organisations, as well as others, have
become polyphonic. They must also make more risk decisions and create
strategies for solving the growing problems related to care. In other words,
they have to make decisions based on a future which is full of complexity
and contingency.
Thus far care has been studied as a medium of communication and the
elements of contemporary organisations of care have been also specified.
However, the system of care does not consist only of organisations, and
care cannot be seen only as a technical communication medium. It should
187

<-----Page 201----->be noted that a great part of care is interconnected with everyday practices,
in this case between a caregiver (specialist) and a patient (client). This
becomes evident when I examine the third element of care: interaction.

Care as Interaction
As noted before, the system of elderly care is quite exceptional because the
‘people’ (or communicative actors) it encompasses are old and their
communicational capabilities are often very limited. That is to say, ‘people’
who are eligible for care can no longer do without everyday care.
Furthermore, their abilities to communicate in other subsystems are also
limited. It is thus more through a person’s inability than ability to
communicate that he reaches inclusion to the system of care within the
welfare state. Despite this, there have to be minimal rules or conditions by
which communication is possible. That is to say, the patient must
communicate one way or another so that the system of care can be
functional, and the patient can be a ‘carrier of communication’.
The minimal conditions for communication to come about us is, that the
part of ego be played by a system that is not completely determined by its
own past and so can react to information as such. In contrast to the mere
perception of informative events, communication comes about only because
ego distinguishes two selections and can manage the difference. The
inclusion of this difference is what makes communication communication,
a special case of information processing per se. The difference lies basically
in the observation of alter by ego. Ego is in a position to distinguish the
utterance from what is uttered. If alter knows that he is being observed, he
can take over this difference between information and utterance and
appropriate it, develop it, exploit it, and use it to steer the communication
process. (Luhmann 1995, 143.)
In the case of elderly care, a patient as a communicative actor (ego) is able
to react only slightly to information. This is because of the weakened
capacity of his organic and psychic systems. He cannot understand
everything the caregiver (social worker or nurse) says and does, and thus is
not able to make further selections or reproduce communication (or at least
188

<-----Page 202----->his ability to reproduce it is very limited). As far as a patient can distinguish
two selections – information and utterance – and can manage the difference,
and furthermore through then understand as well as reproduce
communication, he can be considered to be as a ‘carrier of communication’.
But usually when it comes to the communicational media of care (need for
help),

patients’

capabilities

to

appropriate,

and

exploit

communication are, one way or another, very finite.
However, the caregiver’s communication is largely affected by the patient’s
communication. Caring is seen here as a way to support, through
communication, the patient in his actual everyday routines and to give him
everything he needs. Being capable of caring, the caregiver must also be
able to understand the patient’s communication. This understanding
incorporates the practical, experiential and professional qualities of the
caregiver (or the caregiver’s psychic system). For example, if a social
worker or nurse is highly skilled and experienced he is able to infer a
patient’s communication – from speech, gestures or even bodily functions –
better than those who have worked in an old people’s home only for a short
time. Of course, in some cases, caring for close relatives can beget better
terms of reference for understanding the patient’s communication. Is there,
then, anything meaningful left to be constituted by a subsystem of care,
when mutual and threefold communication between a caregiver and patient
is impossible? Is the patient a ‘carrier of communication’ anymore? Surely
the caregiver alone cannot produce communication and improve inclusion
based on communicative caring professions.
If a patients’ capability to communicate in functional subsystems is in one
way or another limited, it would be better to examine mutual care as
interaction. Basically, it can be said that the care system relies heavily on
face-to-face interaction. It takes place in old people’s homes, where the
physical presence of caregiver and patient is guaranteed. While societal
subsystems such as politics, economy, law or science have become less
dependent on interaction situations and on the existence of personal bonds
189

<-----Page 203----->between partners, care has evolved in another direction. Systems of
interaction, for Luhmann, are confined to exchange between people who are
present. ”Presence is the constitutive and boundary-forming principle of
interaction systems, presence means that people’s being together there
guides the selection of perceptions and marks out prospects for social
relevance.” (Luhmann 1995, 414-415.)
Care of patients who have limited resources for communication, is more
bound to simple interaction than complex communication processes
consisting of several and continuous selections. Already a threefold
communication is quite often impossible and a caregiver’s actions ensue his
perceptions more than an understanding of the uttered information of a
patient. In any event, interactions between people may use and operate
upon communications in a self-referring way, but these communications do
not automatically reach the subsystemic level of communication. Although
care is here seen as a simple social system from the point of view of
communication, I would argue that these interactions are often constituted
by the subsystem of care. In the case of care, even simple interactions are
constituted by the subsystem of care because they are connected to
functions of help. In this type of situation, patients are still constructions of
the care system’s communication. Therefore, these interactions also become
a part of functionally differentiated society and we cannot say that limited
capability to communicate would exclude a patient from the subsystem of
care.
Care as interaction is not thus only a simple social system, because these
interactions (mainly care givers’ treatments to a patient) can be regarded as
closely tied to the professions and functions of help. As a matter of fact,
through these professional interactions care givers (specialists) maintain the
patients’ (clients’) inclusion within the system of care.The very meaning of
caring is to support, and make this natural progression possible; to promote
and maintain life. Put briefly, the system of care sustains the inclusion of
‘people’ within society.
190

<-----Page 204----->It seems obvious that the possible systems-theoretical model of care is
closely connected to simple interaction, because patients who reach a
condition of inclusion in the system of care often have very limited
resources for complex communication. Limited communication resources
do not mean that a patient would not be a ‘carrier of communication’. Care
can also be seen as simple interaction that is constituted by the functional
subsystem of care. This is because these interactions are closely connected
to functions of help.

Some Problems of the System of Care
In the previous chapters I have analysed care as a functional subsystem of
society and examined it through Luhmannian concepts. However, the
position of secondary subsystems, such as the system of care, is not clearly
defined in Luhmannian systems theory. Secondary subsystems are
conditioned by primary subsystems and, consequently, can be seen as
operating through the media and codes of these primary systems. It is
therefore not self-evident that the only way to conceptualise care in the
Luhmannian framework would be to see it as a separate secondary system.
Firstly, although it can be said that the system of care has been built over
the years in the modern welfare state, it is obvious that the development and
differentiation of the medical system has affected today’s model of care at
least as much as the operations of the welfare state. Besides, caring would
be impossible without specialised education (the system of education), new
scientific developments (the system of science), new products of markets
and economic resources (the system of economic) and legal regulation (the
system of law). Therefore, care cannot only be conceived as an autopoietic
secondary system because it is largely conditioned by primary subsystems.
As said before, the very meaning of care is to sustain the inclusion of
‘people’ within society or primary subsystems. This type of inclusion is not
necessarily sustained by the means of care but by medical professions,
191

<-----Page 205----->different payments, political decisions etc. In other words, help concretises
itself through the media and codes of primary systems and the very
meaning of help is to enable the functions of meaning-processing systems
(consciousness and communication) within primary systems.
Secondly, we can ask does care have a functional code – help/not help –
that demarcates communication at the level of facts. All distinctions are not
important for system formation. It could be objected that it is impossible to
define such a specialist-client relationship within care, in which the
systems’ inclusion is achieved through interaction constructed only by the
code of help/not help.
A possible alternative would be to analyse care only as a program or
organisation, which would function on the grounds of the media and codes
of primary systems. As said before, there are now more models for
organising care than before. Caring organisations cannot be seen as
homogenous because they are polyphonic. “Polyphonic organisation is one
that describes itself through many codes and not just one” (Andersen 2003,
169). Caring organisations can, through specialist-client relationships,
prevent exclusion and sustain inclusion but they do this in different ways.
The inclusion of organisations is thus achieved through interaction in which
the specialist (as a representative of the organisation) expresses himself
through several symbolic codes. For example, although being medically
sick, a patient cannot get a bed from a private old people’s home if he does
not have enough money. Here inclusion is prevented and help disqualified
by the economic code (have/not have). Furthermore, it would be
unprofitable to offer a bed for a patient who does not have enough money.
In this situation, a patient can be directed to get help from other
organisations, wherein his inclusion within the primary systems can be
sustained. After all, the multiplicity and polyphonic character of caring
organisations confirm the supposition that it is very difficult to specify the
boundaries and structure of the system of care.
192

<-----Page 206----->In despite of a speaking about systemic or organisatorical model of care, the
fact remains that the limited communication resources of patients affect
their abilities to trust. They do not have many choices besides trusting in the
caregivers. Trust between caregivers and patients plays a crucial role in the
system of care and in caring organisations. In the following section I will
attach the elements of care (systemic communication, organisation and
interaction) to the ideas of trust and confidence. I will also give an overview
of the way in which the interaction between caregiver and patient can be
intimate and connected to the communication of love.

Trust and Care
A care provider is specifically expected to demonstrate impartial concern
for a patient’s well-being. Patients trust that caregivers will take care of
them as well as they can. (See Davies 1999.) But what actually is this kind
of trust? In relationships resulting from a lack of choice or occurring in a
context of inequality, such as that between a care provider and patient, a
form of involuntary trust may appear to exist. However, as trust cannot be
coerced into existence (see Misztal 1996), the involuntary trust evident in
these relationships is more correctly seen as a form of dependency.
Nonetheless, where institutions such as formal models of care are
established by the system of the welfare state to protect the dependent
partner, they may also provide the basis for the emergence of voluntary
trust within the relationship.
As noted before, in the context of advanced systems theory, trust
concretises itself socially in communication, it is a decision that reduces the
complexity of the subsystems. It demands mutual commitment and can only
be put to the test by both sides becoming involved in it, in a fixed order:
first the truster, and then the trustee. Furthermore, the actors who engage in
the process of trust must recognise the situations that involve trust. It is also
impossible to demand the trust of others; trust can only be offered and
193

<-----Page 207----->accepted. Trust must also be earned. The role of trust is emphasised in a
risk society, as we do not need trust in a familiar world or familiar situation.
Trust presupposes a situation of risk. It requires a previous engagement on
one’s part; that is to say, to trust is to take a risk.
Through caring, caregivers try to help patients and increase their feelings of
security. Optimal care requires co-operation or mutual communication
between patient and caregiver. At the centre of care, provision is the
communication between a patient and a provider, and caregivers must know
the exact situations where the building of the trust relation between them
and their patients is possible. The effective delivery of care requires not
only the care service but also its acceptance and use by the patient. A
trusting relationship between caregiver and patient can have a direct
therapeutic effect. Some form of trust is always important in providing a
context in which caregivers and patients can work co-operatively to
establish care objectives and seek reasonable ways of achieving them
(Gilson 2003, 1459). But care givers cannot force patients to trust them.
They must earn the trust.
How, then, are trust, risk and care connected to each other? When elderly
persons begin residence at an old people’s home they face a completely
new environment, where everyday routines and schedules are very different
from their own and where many things are difficult to comprehend. They
are thus living in a world of risks or strangeness because the environment is
no longer familiar. From the caregiver’s point of view, new patients are
strange as well, and there is a great need for trust. Patients’ relatives and
friends also take risks when they decide that their close ‘person’ should go
to old people’s home. Therefore there is also a great need for trust between
caregiver and relatives or friends of a patient. Thomas (1993, 652) calls this
type of care relationship – between individuals who usually are unknown to
each

other

–

a

contingent

caring

relationship.

Almost

every

communicational meeting between unfamiliar caregivers and patients – in
contingent caring relationships – is a risk-based selection. But without these
194

<-----Page 208----->selections, trusting relationships between caregiver and patient would be
impossible.
Interpretated from an advanced Luhmannian point of view, when the caring
relationship is bound to simple interaction and not more complex
subsystemic communication, it is no longer mainly a question of trust, but
of familiarity or confidence. However, as said before, in the case of care,
even simple interactions can be constituted by the possible subsystem of
care or professional caring organisations’ decision-making process. As long
as a patient is capable of thinking, he is (usually) also capable of
communicating one way or another. However, these communications are no
longer so complex that there would be a need for trust which is linked to
risks. If anything, this type of simple interaction recognised by the
subsystem of care or the caring organisations can be connected to
familiarity and confidence. A patient who has limited resources of
communication can only have confidence in the functions of the system of
care or caring organisations, or in a caregiver (a representative of the
system).
This does not mean that familiarity and simple interaction would not exist,
although a patient would still be capable of threefold communication and
thus capable of making communicative trust decisions. In the case of care,
familiarity can also be seen as a precondition for trust. Familiarity increases
within a time. Long-lasting caring relationship in the familiar sphere might
also become intimate, not in the sexual but in the emotional sense. This, of
course, brings intimacy and love to the relationship. The problem of love,
however, “lies in the fact that communication is highly personalized, which
is taken to mean that one endeavours to set oneself off from other
individuals” (Luhmann 1998, 20). This can be achieved by talking about
oneself, or by making one’s grasp of the topic the hub of conversations.
“The more individual, idiosyncratic or strange one’s own standpoint or
view of the world, the more improbable that it will find the consensus of
others or meet with their interest.” (Luhmann 1998, 20.) Love or the

<-----Page 209----->trustworthiness based on it cannot thus be achieved through impersonal and
strange views of the world. Through love, a caregiver is able to show
himself trustworthy only if he is capable of showing himself familiar and
not strange. Furthermore, he has to internalise patients’ subjectively
systematised views of the world. Same preferences also touch a patient. In
Luhmann’s (1998, 21) words:
[In love,] a universal frame of reference is expected of the other partner in
the sense of a constant consideration of oneself in all possible situations. In
other words, the informative content of all communication is constantly
being enriched by the ingredient of ‘for you’.
The kind of trust relations noted above occur only at the interpersonal level.
They do not explain wider processes of trust within the system. In addition
to interpersonal communicative elements, there must also be other ways to
build trust. This is where confidence comes back into play because anyone
who has confidence in a system places his confidence in its function, not in
‘people’.
As said before, a tactical and supportive framework functions behind
confidence. If trust involves risk-oriented communication, confidence, in
turn, is an element of psychic systems or thoughts (which can be socialised
in various ways). That is to say, only psychic actors, not communicative
actors, can have or build confidence. Furthermore, the analytical distinction
between trust and confidence is essential because it allows us to dispose of
the muddled-though, frequently advanced idea of ‘trust in organisations’.
Organisations are factual arrangements that provide incentives and options
to actors who are connected to or live in them. As such, they are factual
constraints of action, the durability and validity of which we can view with
confidence. Trust, then, concretises itself at interpersonal level, but what we
feel or have against organisations can be called confidence. Nonetheless, as
I have noted, confidence cannot be totally separated from trust. Confidence
affects trust and vice versa.

196

<-----Page 210----->‘Persons’ who accept moving to an old people’s home always have some
level of confidence in these institutions. This type of confidence works at
the level of thoughts (psychic systems). Annette Baier (1994, 105) has
proposed interpreting this type of trust (that I here call confidence) as
“letting other persons take care of something the truster cares about, where
such ‘caring for’ involves some kind of discretionary power”. For her, trust
implies “reliance on another’s competence and willingness to look after,
rather than harm things one cares about which are entrusted to the
caregiver” (Baier 1994, 128).55 This type of confidence has been built
because of patients’ socialisation and cultural background. In other words,
familiarity affects indirectly on confidence. In the case of the system of
care, a level of confidence is largely dictated by the actions of the system of
the welfare state, the medical system, and the inclusive caring professions.
For example, in the context of social Catholicism – a philosophy that to
varying degrees underpins all of the Central and South European welfare
states – the giving and receiving of care is part of the normal reciprocity
between individuals who are defined by the nature of their embeddedness in
the range of social relations (see Daly 1999). Here, family solidarity has
been understood as a readiness to care for one another, and in line with this
philosophical thread, social policies have been constructed in such a way as
to enable the family to carry out the caring functions and programs
considered as normal and appropriate to it. Indeed, the very role of the state
55
Baier’s approach to trust is quite a sensitive one. She wants to examine the concept of
trust from a feminist perspective. According to Baier, women operate in a different system
of ethics than men. Males base their ethic on obligation (or justice), whereas women
depend on ethics of caring (trust). The history of moral philosophy, having been written by
men, does not account for this gender difference. As Baier (1986, 248-249) says: “It
becomes fairly easy to see one likely explanation of the neglect in Western moral
philosophy of the full range of sorts of trust. Both before the rise of a society which needed
contract and commercial device , and after it, women were counted on to serve men, to
raise their children to fill the roles were expected to fill and not deceive their men about the
paternity of these children. What men counted on one another for, in work and war,
presupposed this background domestic trust, trust in women not merely no to poison their
men, but to turn out sons who could trust and be trusted in traditional men’s roles and
daughters who would reduplicate their own capacities for trust and trustworthiness. Since
the women’s role did not include the writing of moral treatises, any thoughts they had
about trust, based on their experience of it, did not get into our tradition.”

197

<-----Page 211----->is defined in such as way as to allow the family the first right to care (Daly
and Lewis 2000, 288). With this type of welfare policy, the elderly have
more confidence in their families – as well as trust in their family members
– than in other forms of care and caregivers. But in countries that have a
broad public care policy, for example in Scandinavia, the situation is of
course quite different.
Trust, then, is a key factor in building relationships between caregivers and
patients. Building trust at the interpersonal level always requires at least
two actors: the caregiver and the patient. When these are unfamiliar with
each other, they live in a situation of risk and complexity. The reducing of
this complexity is possible with the help of trust. However, trust building
would be impossible without familiarity and confidence. Confidence affects
our thoughts and is a product of our thoughts. It can be socialised in various
ways, and it can indirectly affect our ability to trust and reduce complexity.
If people have confidence in the system of care and caring organisations, it
means that they know the system’s constituent elements (the care policy
and regimes of the system of the welfare state). Without this confidence it
would be much more difficult to build the interpersonal trust relations
between caregivers and patients.
To conclude, in this chapter I have attempted to clarify the emergence or
differentiation and functions of the subsystem of care, especially care of the
elderly, from the perspective of Luhmann’s systems theory. The most
important elements of the Luhmannian system of care are represented in
Figure 9. I would like to conclude with some general observations
regarding this model.

Interaction

Figure 9. The basic elements of the subsystem of care.

First, the possible differentiation of the care system can be closely linked to
the notion of inclusion within the system of the welfare state. As shown in
figure 9, care consists of professional communication, the code of which is
to help/not help. From a systems-theoretical point of view, communication
is the most important element of the system of care. A system of care can
be seen here as an encompassing system that includes anything which
appears as caring communication. This means that the system makes
possible the functions of caring organisations and interaction connecting to
care. Through communication, the functional communication and simple
interaction between a care giver and a patient or an organisation become
possible and tenable.
Second, the visible elements of various forms of care consist of different
organisations (see figure 9), for example old people’s homes, whose duty it
is to make decisions, through which the development and extension of care
is possible. Today, care organisations can be seen as polyphonic, hence
their only primary code is not to help/not help, but they also have to answer
to financial, political, medical and legal demands.
Third, with regard to its systemic form and organisation, care also consists
of interaction between caregiver and patient, which is the third element of
care (see figure 9). What makes the possible system of care exceptional,
compared to other subsystems, is the fact that the human beings it includes
199

<-----Page 213----->have, one way or another, a limited communicating ability. This is what
makes even a simple interaction very important. Even though the mutual
communication between a caregiver and patient ends, caring takes place in
the society because there is still simple interaction, which is connected to
the function of help and is thus constituted by the functional subsystem of
care.
However, some problems remain that question the subsystemic character of
care. Because care is largely conditioned by primary systems, it cannot only
be conceived as an autopoietic secondary system. Rather, help offered by
the system of care concretises itself through the media and codes of primary
systems, and the very meaning of help is to enable the functions of
meaning-processing systems within primary systems. Therefore, a possible
alternative would be to analyse care only as a program or organisation,
which would function on the grounds of the media and codes of primary
systems. Care organisations’ inclusion is achieved through interaction
wherein the specialist expresses himself through several symbolic codes.
Last, it would be almost impossible to imagine the possible subsystem of
care or caring organisations functioning without trust between caregivers
and patients. Communicative trust within care is needed because patients
cannot manage everyday routines without help, and are dependent upon the
caregivers. Caregivers can also make their work easier if they show
themselves to be trustworthy and capable of reducing the strangeness and
complexity of the patients’ new environment. Furthermore, both patients
and caregivers must have confidence in the caring organisations as well as
the functions of the system of care. Without such confidence it would be
much harder, if not impossible, to build mutual trust relations. As I have
emphasised on several occasions, confidence needs trust and vice versa.
Finally, a caring relationship is usually bound to simple interaction, which
is based on norms and familiar routines. This type of caring relationship is
no longer connected to risk-based selections and there is no need for trust.
Long-lasting caring relationship might also become intimate. However,
200

<-----Page 214----->because even simple interaction in the case of care is constituted by the
possible subsystem of care or caring organisations, patients can in these
situations – in addition to familiarity – also have confidence in the functions
of the system of care or caring organisations.

201

<-----Page 215----->Conclusion: Why Did the Question of Trust
Disappear?
In the above chapters I examined the problems and functions of trust (as
well as familiarity and confidence) in Luhmannian systems theory. I also
analysed the general systems theory, Luhmann’s conception of the welfare
state, organisation theory, and the problematics of the system of care and
caring organisations. I will now briefly sum up the most important results
concerning the main research problem of this work, trust.
I began my analysis by examining Luhmann’s own writings on trust. For
Luhmann, familiarity, confidence and trust are different modes of asserting
expectations. Our ability to trust other people is not a self-evident thing, but
needs familiarity as its historical background. However, because of growing
complexity, living in a completely familiar world is no longer possible.
Therefore, behind the need for trust is the growing complexity of society.
Following Luhmann, I have grasped trust as a decision through which one
can reduce complexity. Trust, for Luhmann, is principally interpersonal.
The decision to trust is oriented towards the future; to trust is to take a risk.
However, personal trust is not enough to explain the wider processes. This
is where confidence (or system trust) comes into play. Following Luhmann,
to be able to act within the context of different systems (economy, politics,
law etc.) we must have confidence in their functions. Confidence is general,
and not personal, as is trust.
Chapter Three dealt with Talcott Parsons’ and Georg Simmel’s concepts of
trust, which have had an important influence on Luhmann’s research in this
area. I also considered Anthony Giddens’ and Piotr Sztompka’s concepts of
trust, which in turn have been largely affected by Luhmann. The boundaries
of a system, its particular form, and the family’s socialising role, were
important milestones in Parsons’ as well as Luhmann’s conceptions of trust.
The connections between Simmel and Luhmann, in turn, can be
202

<-----Page 216----->summarised as follows: both coupled trust with the problem of knowledge
and ‘non-knowledge’ – how to renew trust was an important question for
Simmel as well as Luhmann – and Simmel’s theory of the stranger also
influenced Luhmann. Giddens and Sztompka, like Luhmann, emphasise
that trust has something to do with risks. Giddens follows Luhmann in
distinguishing trust in people and trust in systems. Sztompka does not make
this distinction, but argues that the functions of trust occur at the personal,
communal and systemic levels.
In Chapter Four I outlined the basic concepts of Luhmann’s autopoietic
systems theory: autopoiesis, interpenetration and three-part communication,
evolution and differentiation. This was because only by means of these
theoretical ideas is it possible to examine the functions and problems of
Luhmannian trust in the context of advanced systems theory. These ideas
provided the necessary backgroung for Chapter Five, where I studied
Luhmann’s own theory of trust in the context of his advanced systems
theory. From this point of view, familiarity can be seen as a precondition
for trust as well as for confidence. It is a part of simple interaction, but has
no great importance at the level of subsystemic communication. Trust as a
decision is a part of communication and, thereby, a part of social systems.
Confidence, for its part, is a part of thought or psychic systems, which,
because of interpenetration, affects the decision to trust. Similarly, trust
indirectly affects our confidential thinking. However, confidence can be
concretised through the media of subsystems or in some other way, such as
through elections and opinion polls. Unlike trust, confidence is not
connected to risk but to danger.
In the last three chapters the fruitfulness of the Luhmannian concepts of
familiarity, trust and confidence was tested in the contexts of ‘strangers’,
the welfare state and care. The first of these concentrated on interpersonal
problems of trust, whereas in the latter two the problems of confidence and
trust were discussed in the context of the functions of systems and
organisations. In Chapter Six I examined the problematics of the ‘stranger’
203

<-----Page 217----->and trust. The Luhmannian concept of trust fits a society of ‘universal
strangers’ well, where ‘persons’ are invisible or omnipresent. All are, as
Rudolf Stichweh would say, indifferent to each other. In this type of society
we do not register ‘persons’ as individuals, but rather, as ‘carriers’ of
functional communication. These ‘indifferent strangers’ are not familiar to
us. Therefore, the role of communicative trust becomes essential because
through accepting or providing trust, the ‘indifferent stranger’ becomes
important to us.We only trust strangers who we think have the same
interests as ours. Trust is one way to transform the ‘indifferent stranger’
into an interested one.
Chapter Seven dealt with the problematics of the system of the welfare state
and trust. In the context of the welfare state, it is not very fruitful to speak
of trust, but rather, of confidence. This is because situations where we place
our trust directly in a political decision-maker as an individual are rare. The
public’s confidence in politics is systems-theoretically dependent on the
binding decisions made by politicians. Although the public cannot affect
these decisions, it is able to evaluate the risks and the possibilities of
averting or reducing them. In the system of the welfare state, the public can
indirectly affect decisions and risks through elections. Confidence between
the public and politics socialises itself in the form of elections. The public’s
confidence in politics is systems-theoretically dependent of the latter’s risktaking binding decisions that succeed in reducing complexity. Through
confidence, the system of politics is capable of observing itself and its
success in reducing this complexity. The system of the welfare state
consists of several organisations that need each other. Organisations, too,
must therefore trust each other. It is again fruitful to speak of trust, because
organisations must take risks. The organisational framework of deliberation
and decision-making are important factors of trust between organisations.
Organisational trust decisions concern wider populations than mutual trust
decisions. Organisational trust cannot be constructed by a single human
being, and its emergence is a much larger process than the processes
leading to personal trust decisions. The trusting relationship reached
204

<-----Page 218----->between organisations is not continuous but has to be rebuilt again and
again. However, if we talk about organisations that have a long history of
collaboration with one another, the situation is quite different. In these
cases, organisations are familiar to one another. This type of
interorganisational co-operation is not closely linked to new risk-taking
decisions and the need for trust, but instead refers to operating in a familiar
world.
Chapter Eight considered the problematics of the system of care, caring
organisations and trust. The subsystem of care consists of three basic
elements: communication, organisation and interaction. Here, trust deals
with subsystemic communication, confidence with organisation, and
familiarity with simple interaction. Communicative trust within the system
of care is connected to risk-based selections between caregivers and
patients. Furthermore, both caregivers and patients must have confidence in
the caring organisations as well as the functions of the system of care.
Confidence within the system of care concretises itself especially at the
organisational level. Furthermore, a caring relationship is bound to simple
interaction, which is based on familiar routines. However, in the context of
the system of care and caring organisations, familiarity, trust and
confidence need each other here as well.
Having analysed Luhmann’s theory of trust, and after examining it in the
context of advanced systems theory and applying it to the contexts of
‘strangers’, the welfare state and care, I now would like to conclude this
work with some critical reflections. In particular, I will deal with the
question: Why did the question of trust disappear from Luhmann’s systems
theory?
As noted above, Luhmann’s writings on trust are very well-known and
largely cited by researchers in many disciplines. Therefore it is quite
surprising, even paradoxical, that Luhmann himself did not write about trust
or confidence after 1988, although during the 1980s and especially the
205

<-----Page 219----->1990s his concept of trust was an essential concern or theoretical
background for numerous researchers. In any case, I am critical of the
disappearance of the question of trust in Luhmann’s writings. As stated in
Chapter One, the systems-theoretical ‘silence’ on trust was also an
important starting point for the study at hand. Furthermore, Luhmann left
open the question of how trust and confidence function in the context of
advanced systems theory. Many researchers have cited only two or three
sentences from Luhmann’s Vertrauen, and have left Luhmann’s advanced
systems theory completely ‘untouched’. In other words, they have only
familiarised themselves with the ‘early’ writings of Luhmann. Why, then,
did Luhmann not deal with the question of trust and confidence after 1988?
Luhmann does not answer this question. We are therefore greatly dependent
on speculation. The easiest answer might be that because Luhmann wanted
to stand apart from mainstream sociology, he did not intervene in the
sociological discussion of trust, which did not operate in the context of
autopoietic systems theory.
Nonetheless, the silence on the issue of trust in Luhmann’s later systemstheoretical writings was not complete. In his most important books, Soziale
Systeme (1984) and Die Gesellschaft der Gesellshaft (1997), the topic was
touched upon, but only cursorily. In Soziale Systeme Luhmann writes about
trust in the context of double contingency. This analysis is not very
intensive, and it seems that trust had somehow lost its explicit importance
in Luhmann’s advanced systems theory. The second reason for the
disappearance of trust, then, deals with the fact that in his advanced
systems-theoretical thinking there seemed to be no real ‘room’ for trust, and
the functionality of the mediums (e.g. money, power, law) of subsystems
(economy, politics, justice) assumed more importance. Functionally
thinking, then, the problem of trust is already included in the larger problem
of double contingency.56 This is because the doubly contingent character of
56

The Dutch system theorist Raf Vanderstraeten familiarised me with this hypothesis in
our discussion in Bielefeld in the winter of 2001. At the time, he had just completed an

206

<-----Page 220----->social interaction is a consequence of the confrontation of at least two
autonomous systems that make their own selections in relation to one
another. These types of relationships are connected to risks and complexity
because the participants are always opaque and incalculable to each other.
However, the explicit absence of trust might also be explained from a
different point of view. The third reason could be that Luhmann may have
thought that he had already said everything of importance with regard to the
problematic of trust. Luhmann’s aim was presumably to explain the nature
of the phenomenon of trust and not to test it in special spheres such as those
of ‘strangers’, enemies, different subsystems etc. For Luhmann, trust may
have been such a self-evident feature of risk societies that he did not want
to literally repeat or overemphasise its importance. In risk society, trust
makes system formations possible; it seems to be like a ‘social contract’
through which living in the conditions of double contingency and risks is
possible. As Luhmann (1995, 129) puts it:
Above all, trust has the circular, self-presupposing and confirming character
that belongs to all structures emerging from double contingency. It makes
the formation of systems possible and in return acquires strength from them
for increased, riskier reproduction. This is why it depends on symbolic
cover: it reacts to critical informations not because the facts that they report,
but because they function as indicators of trustworthiness.
Fourthly, Luhmann may have left the concept of trust to ‘rest in peace’,
because he perhaps noticed that trust does not, after all, reduce complexity
quite in the manner he had thought earlier. I would argue that trust is not a
general ‘remedy’ against complexity in world society. As stated earlier, for
Luhmann, complexity is a way of thinking, and thus can be connected to
almost all things and phenomena. If to trust is to take a risk, this can reduce
one type of complexity: the type present in certain risk-taking situations. At
the same time, however, new risk-taking situations develop, resulting in

article, Parsons, Luhmann and the Theorem of Double Contingency (2002), where he deals
with the Luhmannian problems of social relations.

207

<-----Page 221----->new needs for trust. The circle of the need for trust thus seems to be
endless. It may be better to become reconciled to the fact that the functions
of trust are connected only to trust’s ability to ‘cut’ contingency.
Complexity itself means being forced to select, being forced to select means
contingency, and contingency means risk (Luhmann 1995, 25). This means
that trust – affected by complexity – amounts to a selection of a situation of
contingency and risk, which in turn does not necessarily mean reducing
complexity, but only that the situation of contingency changes, or at least is
challenged. As Luhmann (1995, 26) says; “Only complexity can reduce
complexity”. Therefore a decision to trust someone only means the
reduction or ‘cutting’ of contingency, and might also be a precondition for
reducing one type of complexity (the type present in a certain risk-taking
situation).
Finally, Luhmann may not have wanted to theorise about trust in his later
works because it does not fit very well in to his larger systems-theoretical
context. This is the strongest argument for explaining the disappearance of
the issue of trust. As noted in Chapter Two, Luhmann already argued at the
end of the 1960s – in Vertrauen – that personal trust yields to system trust.
For Luhmann (1979, 58; 22), system trust counts on explicit processes and
is not only applicable to social systems but also to other people as personal
systems. This opinion seems to become only stronger in his later writings
on the system of science (Luhmann 1990b)57 or on the computer age, which
he studied in his last major work Die Gesellschaft der Gesellshaft (1997).
Luhmann explored the growing expansion of computers, and particularly
the new forms of communication enabled by the computer age. In an era of
electronic data processing there cannot be that much trust which is bound to
the truster’s and trustee’s personal characteristics or social status; but
instead, system trust gathers way. (Luhmann 1997, 313.) It could also be
that in his later writings Luhmann may have emphasised the role of system
57
Luhmann strongly stresses the importance of confidence in the system of science. We
have confidence in science, because it reports on real findings. New findings are more
important than older ones. Therefore, the importance of trustworthy new and real findings
is emphasised in the context of science. (Luhmann 1990, 227; 588.)

208

<-----Page 222----->trust or confidence because he wanted to separate individuals as ‘full
persons’ from society. If society does not consist of ‘persons’ (but of
communication instead), how can there then be personal trust of the kind
that is present in the ‘early’ Luhmannian writings.
According to Luhmann, in the modern world it is system trust, then, not
personal trust, that is paramount. Luhmann does not deny the existence of
interpersonal trust or denigrate its importance. But in the modern world, or
‘uncertainty society’58, it will never be enough. To live in a complex society
without going mad, we must have confidence in systems as well. It even
looks like Luhmann takes the same path as Giddens, who also emphasises
the role of system trust in modern society. Emphasising the importance of
system trust over personal trust in modern society might sound logical, but
from an advanced systems-theoretical point of view it cannot be true. Here
lies an obvious paradox. Why?
At least four facts can be found that explain why the preference of system
trust or confidence is misleading in the context of advanced systems theory.
First, as I have shown earlier, only trust is an element of communication
and, thus, an element of social systems. Confidence is an element of
psychic systems and so cannot have a direct influence on trust. However,
because of interpenetration, confidence needs trust and vice versa. Second,
we can live in a complex society and have confidence or system trust, but to
be able to reduce this complexity we must trust. Third, trust is the visible
part, while confidence is invisible (although it can be socialised and, thus, it
can become visible). Fourth, Luhmann thinks that in modern society there

58

According to Risto Eräsaari (2003, 38), in the modern ‘uncertainty society’ science
provides us with new knowledge and expertise which are most often used to broaden,
extend and reframe knowledge in the forms of technical know-how or other knowledge
spirals. But this knowledge generates further uncertainties, further complexity and further
unknown factors. Eräsaari means that uncertainty must here be seen as ambivalence, which
is an epistemic state of not believing or knowing for certain. In this type of society he
prefers uncertainty to risk. From the Luhmannian standpoint, we can thus say that in an
ambivalent ‘uncertainty society’ the role of system trust – directed at expertise and
technical know-how – is emphasised.

209

<-----Page 223----->is no centre or periphery; in other words, every subsystem is equally
important.
On the grounds of these facts, I criticise Luhmann’s preference for
confidence. How could confidence be more important than trust, if there is,
at the same time, no order of importance between the societal subsystems?
Luhmann’s division between trust and confidence becomes a problematic
one if we try to prioritise them. It seems that here Luhmann has forgotten
one of his main themes: society consists only of communication, and this
means that in society there can only be trust and socialised confidence.
Another question is this: Did Luhmann notice the paradox he created,
which others, although citing him, did not notice? In other words, was
Luhmann familiar with the systems-theoretical paradox of prioritising
confidence or system trust, and aware of the fact that other researchers
mainly swallow this paradox by arguing that in modern society system trust
or confidence is more important than personal trust? I would say yes,
because Luhmann, if anyone, loved paradoxes. With his silence, he left the
paradox open to later developments in systems theory.
In addition, it is also interesting to ask: Where does trust come from?
Luhmann does not give us a direct or unequivocal answer to this question
either. One possible answer might be that trust has the characteristics of an
‘imaginary institution’ that no one has seen but everyone talks about, and it
exists only because we do talk about it. Trust, therefore, exists only because
of communication. However, one might now ask: What happens to trust if
we do not communicate, if there is sometimes a total silence? As noted
above, by silence Luhmann may have left the paradox of trust open. As a
matter of fact, silence is itself a Luhmannian paradox; namely, as long as a
double contingent encounter exists, one person’s silence is always
interpreted by the other. This means that silence becomes a form of
communication. A social system, then, cannot be silent per se. It can only
exist, or not exist. (Arnoldi 2001, 8.) Luhmann’s point is that noncommunication is in fact communication. Therefore we might say that trust,
210

<-----Page 224----->too, can only exist, or not exist. We could say that by a paradox of silence,
Luhmann ‘communicates’ the paradox of trust. To say it ‘paradoxically’:
after 1988, Luhmann did not talk about trust, but in any case
‘communicated’ about it through silence. In this work I have tried to end
this systems-theoretical silence regarding trust. Through communication the
‘early’ Luhmannian trust has been considered in the context of advanced
systems theory, which, in turn, has been put to the test in the spheres of
‘strangers’, the system of the welfare state and the system of care. Trust
exists for as long as we communicate it, but through ‘silence’ it cannot
reduce complexity nor reproduce it.
