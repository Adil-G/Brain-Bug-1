The authors propose the use of experience sampling methodology (ESM) as an innovative
methodological approach to address critical questions in entrepreneurship research. ESM
requires participants to provide reports of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors at multiple
times across situations as they happen in the natural environment. Thus, ESM allows
researchers to capture dynamic person-by-situation interactions as well as between- and
within-person processes, improve the ecological validity of results, and minimize
retrospective biases. The authors provide a step-by-step description of how to design and
implement ESM studies beginning with research design and ending with data analysis,
and including issues of implementation such as time and resources needed, participant
recruitment and orientation, signaling procedures, and the use of computerized devices and
wireless technologies. The authors also describe a cell phone ESM protocol that enables
researchers to monitor and interact with participants in real time, reduces costs, expedites
data entry, and increases convenience. Finally, the authors discuss implications of ESMbased research for entrepreneurs, business incubators, and entrepreneurship educators.

hane and Venkataraman (2000) defined the field of entrepreneurship as ‘‘the scholarly
examination of how, by whom, and with what effects opportunities to create future
goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited’’ (p. 218; cf. Venkataraman,
1997). In spite of the tremendous volume of empirical research that is generated in the field of
entrepreneurship, there is a clear knowledge gap regarding process-oriented research to unravel

the ‘‘how’’ in entrepreneurship (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001; Low & MacMillan, 1988; Van de
Ven, 1992). Process-oriented studies are critical in moving the field forward because entrepreneurship is a process that unfolds over time (Gartner, 1985; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
One reason for the dearth of process-oriented research in entrepreneurship is clearly methodological in nature. Notwithstanding the contributions of existing studies, typically used
methodological tools are not able to uncover dynamic processes because they investigate variables and relationships in a static manner. For example, one-time surveys do not fully address
questions about processes unfolding over time such as ‘‘How do entrepreneurs identify, evaluate, and implement business opportunities?’’, ‘‘How do entrepreneurs cope with difficulties
in the venture creation process?’’, and ‘‘How do the entrepreneurs’ skills affect the process of
acquiring venture resources?’’ A concrete example of a process-oriented construct that is not
adequately addressed by existing entrepreneurship research is affect (i.e., feelings and
moods). Baron (2008) suggested that affect influences whether and how entrepreneurs recognize opportunities and acquire resources for their ventures. This is because affect influences
information individuals attend to, how they process information, and their motivations.
Studying affect requires a methodological approach that can assess an entrepreneur’s affect
at many points in time rather than assume that affect remains constant.
Another gap in the entrepreneurship literature is the lack of empirical studies that examine within-individual relationships. The existing literature has advanced our understanding
of between-person relationships where comparisons are made among entrepreneurs (cf.
Busenitz et al., 2003; Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001). For example, a fairly typical
between-group comparison involves contrasting groups of successful and less successful
entrepreneurs to gain an understanding of factors that differentiate members of one group
versus the other (e.g., Aguinis, Ansari, Jayasingam, & Aafaqi, 2008).
There are at least two reasons why the examination of within-individual processes is crucial
in entrepreneurship. First, no two individuals share exactly the same information at the same
time and information about resources, technology, and changes in the environment is dispersed
according to the idiosyncratic life circumstances of each individual (Venkataraman, 1997).
Hence, the decision to exploit an opportunity is made based on the entrepreneur’s payoffs
relative to that entrepreneur’s alternatives, not on the basis of payoffs to other entrepreneurs.
Second, the metric to evaluate entrepreneurial activity should not be relative to other entrepreneurs’ performance as in, for example, the field of strategic management, but rather comparing
performance assessments of that entrepreneur over time (Shane, 2003; Venkataraman, 1997).
Within-person variability is meaningful and substantial in the field of entrepreneurship where
various processes and other dynamic constructs of interest such as effort and performance
exhibit changing patterns over time within the individual entrepreneur.
We propose the use of experience sampling methodology (ESM) as a methodological
approach that allows for a longitudinal examination of the nature and causal directionality
among the constructs investigated (cf. Stone-Romero & Rosopa, 2008). ESM, also known
as ecological momentary assessment, is an innovative methodological approach that allows
research participants to provide reports of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors at multiple
times across a range of situations as they occur in the participants’ natural environment
(Larson & Csikszentmihalyi, 1983; Stone & Shiffman, 1994). In this article, we argue that
entrepreneurship researchers will benefit from using ESM to conduct process-oriented
research and analyze both between- and within-person variability.

The next section provides background information on ESM. We explain how scholars
can capitalize on ESM’s strengths to advance entrepreneurship theory, particularly given
its ability to capture dynamic person-by-situation interactions over time, its ecological
validity, its potential to capture both between- and within-person processes, and its ability
to reduce memory (i.e., retrospective) biases. Then, we recommend detailed, step-by-step
actions involved in implementing ESM studies including participant recruitment and orientation and the use of various devices to conduct ESM research. Furthermore, we introduce
an improved ESM protocol, which uses wireless technology capabilities available in cell
phones. This novel cell phone-based ESM allows researchers to interact with and monitor
participants in real time, expedites data entry, reduces costs, and increases convenience. In
short, in this article, we make the case for the need for ESM and the benefits associated with
its use. In addition, we provide a thorough description of how researchers can conduct an
ESM study and suggest ways to make the ESM approach practically feasible, particularly
given its payoff in terms of its ability to address questions of practical significance in
the entrepreneurship field (cf. Aguinis et al., in press).

ESM
ESM is a methodological approach that allows researchers to gather detailed accounts of
people’s daily experiences over time and capture the ebb and flow of these experiences as
they occur in situ (i.e., in the natural environment; Hormuth, 1986). The three types of ESM
protocols are (a) interval contingent, (b) event contingent, and (c) signal contingent (Reis &
Gable, 2000; Wheeler & Reis, 1991). In the interval-contingent protocol, participants
provide ESM responses at predetermined intervals (e.g., every hour) or at the same time
daily. An example of this type of protocol is the study by Ilies and Judge (2002) in which
participants reported their mood and job satisfaction four times daily at fixed intervals for
19 working days. In the event-contingent protocol, participants respond only when the event
of interest takes place. For example, Cote and Moskowitz (1998) studied affect and interpersonal behavior by requiring participants to monitor their social interactions and report on
features of their interactions for 20 consecutive days, that is, participants completed ESM
surveys immediately after the occurrence of significant interpersonal interactions (those
lasting for at least 5 min). In the signal-contingent protocol, participants are prompted to
respond by a signaling device at randomly selected time points in the day. As an illustration,
Williams and Alliger (1994) examined mood spillover among working parents by requiring
participants to complete the experience sampling forms when prompted by the sound of the
alarm watches eight times daily (randomly scheduled) for 7 days.
Researchers can select from the three protocols to conduct ESM studies in entrepreneurship. Event-contingent ESM may be applicable for less frequently occurring phenomena
such as opportunity discovery and evaluation. For example, researchers can ask entrepreneurs to report on independent variables such as their interactions (e.g., frequency and
quality of interactions) and see how features of these encounters predict the types of business opportunities they recognize. Either interval-contingent or signal-contingent ESM may
be used to examine the entrepreneurs’ day-to-day venture efforts and how these efforts
build up and influence their level of venture commitment and satisfaction. However, most

ESM studies are signal contingent (Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) because
this protocol allows for random sampling of a broad variety of events and avoids the
systematic bias of fixed-time assessments and the expectancy effects associated with prior
knowledge of the sampling period (Alliger & Williams, 1993).
Scollon, Kim-Prieto, and Diener (2003) identified four major strengths of ESM. First,
ESM provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence response outcomes;
second, it enhances the ecological validity of the results; third, it allows researchers to
examine both within- and between-person processes; and, finally, it reduces memory
(i.e., retrospective) biases. Next, we describe each of these general strengths of ESM and
link them to specific questions, research streams, and theories in entrepreneurship research.

ESM Captures Dynamic Person-by-Situation Interactions Over Time
Interaction effects are at the heart of many scientific disciplines (Aguinis, 2004; Aguinis,
Beaty, Boik, & Pierce, 2005). A methodological strength of ESM is its ability to capture the
dynamic interplay of within-individual and situational variables over time (Scollon et al.,
2003). Shane (2003) argued that ‘‘entrepreneurship can be explained by considering the
nexus of enterprising individuals and valuable opportunities . . . and by using that nexus
to understand the processes of discovery and exploitation of opportunities; the acquisition
of resources; entrepreneurial strategy; and the organizing process’’ (p. 9). Given ESM’s
ability to capture the dynamic person-by-situation interaction, entrepreneurship researchers
can use it to address questions on the individual-opportunity nexus. ESM studies can
address questions including aspects of the physical environment (e.g., venue, time), social
context (e.g., number and descriptions of interactions), thoughts, feelings, actions, and
motivational self-appraisals (Csikszentmihalyi & LeFevre, 1989; Fisher, 2000; Hektner
et al., 2007). Key moments of interest such as the ‘‘aha’’ or ‘‘eureka’’ experiences in
opportunity discovery can be matched with contextual variables such as the entrepreneur’s
location, time of day, and the people they were interacting with at that particular moment.
Researchers can investigate whether these situational features interact with individual-level
variables (e.g., thoughts, feelings, actions) in influencing the types of opportunities that
entrepreneurs discover.
Entrepreneurial motivation is another domain that incorporates person and situation
factors and potential interactions between them. Previous studies have asked entrepreneurs
to recall their goals to find out what predicts entrepreneurial behavior (e.g., Kuratko,
Horsnby, & Naffziger, 1997). Such one-time assessment assumes that person-situation
factors that motivate entrepreneurs at the onset remain constant and influence all steps in
the entrepreneurial process equally. This assumption may be questionable because the
entrepreneurial process is dynamic and motivating factors in the nascent stage could be different from other venture stages (Shane, Locke, & Collins, 2003; Stanworth & Curran,
1973). With ESM, these concerns can be significantly reduced, if not circumvented,
because it allows researchers to track motivational influences at different stages of the
entrepreneurial process and how outcome variables such as changes in their venture goals
(dependent variables) are predicted by individual and situational factors, such as their level
of optimism and entrepreneurial self-efficacy (independent variables).

ESM Enhances Ecological Validity
Ecological validity is the extent to which findings can be generalized to the naturally
occurring situations in which the phenomenon that is investigated takes place (Brunswick,
1949). Existing studies on how entrepreneurs make decisions and evaluate opportunities are
often scenario based where participants evaluate cases or vignettes on the basis of the
information available for each hypothetical situation (e.g., Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Choi
& Shepherd, 2004; Keh, Foo, & Lim, 2002). Although scenarios provide respondents with
standardized stimuli, the stakes are not real and assumptions are often simplified; participants
might underestimate the risks involved, and the decisions made might not reflect how entrepreneurs actually make such decisions. In a related vein, some studies that probe on investors’
decision-making processes use verbal protocol analysis, which requires participants to ‘‘think
out loud’’ as they carry out a particular task as prompted by a hypothetical stimulus (e.g., Hall
& Hofer, 1993; Mason & Stark, 2004). The verbalizations of participants are audio recorded,
transcribed, and content analyzed through a coding scheme generated for particular research
questions (Sarasvathy, Simon, & Lave, 1998). Notwithstanding the benefit of a much richer
understanding of the process of interest, which verbal protocols offer, the effect of artificiality
of the situation persists much like in scenario-based studies.
Researchers can use ESM to circumvent the limitations of scenario-based studies and
examine entrepreneurs at the moment they discover or evaluate opportunities together with
factors that affected this discovery and evaluation. Furthermore, ESM can also capture
dynamic factors in cognition, which influence how entrepreneurs make decisions and how
they act (Baron, 2008; cf. Mitchell et al., 2002). These include the entrepreneurs’ temporal
focus (i.e., extent to which they think about the past, present, or future), their perceived goal
progress, the degree to which they focus on maximizing gains or on avoiding losses, what
they attend to at a particular moment (e.g., whether they are thinking about customers’
needs, technological requirements, and new markets), and their emotional states at
that moment (Uy, 2009). All these cognitive factors can be examined as independent variables that could potentially affect the outcome of opportunity evaluation (whether the entrepreneur evaluates the business idea favorably or otherwise and the likelihood that the
entrepreneur implements the idea).

ESM Allows for an Examination of Between- and Within-Person Variability
ESM allows researchers to examine within-person variations (Beal & Weiss, 2003;
Scollon et al., 2003). Beal and Weiss (2003) underscored that within-person variability provides a more in-depth understanding of the processes linking the predictor and criterion
variables as within-person research can rule out spurious third variable explanations and
coincident trends. Spurious variables are relatively stable variables that can be measured
at one point in time, such as personality factors, but they can also be a slice of a coincident
trend, such as satisfaction at one point in time (Beal & Weiss, 2003).
More importantly, within-person processes provide insights beyond that of a betweenperson approach. Relationships analyzed using within- and between-individual approaches
can vary dramatically in both magnitude and direction (Tennen & Affleck, 1996) because
interindividual (between-person) and intraindividual (within-person) relationships are

<-----Page 6----->36 Organizational Research Methods

independent. For example, although momentary exercise increases momentary heart rate
(within-individual), frequent exercises decrease chronic heart rate (across-individual). In
a study that required participants to engage in an analytic game, Vancouver, Thompson,
Tishner, and Putka (2002) found that across individuals, self-efficacy was positively related
to performance, but within individuals, self-efficacy was negatively related to performance
over time as high self-efficacy can lead to errors because of overconfidence. Although
beyond the findings of Vancouver et al. (2002), there may be nonlinear effects of selfefficacy on performance such that initial increases of self-efficacy improve performance,
but beyond a certain level, self-efficacy hurts performance. Such curvilinear effects can
be modeled using ESM data.
Practically all empirical studies in entrepreneurship have examined between-person
variability instead of within-individual variability (e.g., Baron & Markman, 2003; Zhao,
Seibert, & Hills, 2005). Notwithstanding the contributions of studies that have focused
on between-person variability, an intraindividual approach is worth pursuing because of the
substantive insights we can obtain beyond those of interindividual studies. For example, we
expect fear of failure (predictor variable) and the level of entrepreneurial activity (outcome
variable) to be negatively related from a between-person analysis. With the high mortality
rate among new ventures, those who are more fearful or have greater fear of failure might be
less likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities compared to the less fearful ones. However, fear might not reduce efforts if a within-individual approach is used as an entrepreneur
can increase venture efforts for fear of losing the venture. Researchers can also use ESM to
examine the entrepreneur’s emotional stability (a personality trait) and how this predicts
their day-to-day stress levels and psychological well-being. Between-person analysis
cannot control for all personality traits that account for the levels of the entrepreneur’s
well-being. ESM accommodates within-individual analysis, and differences in other
personality and attitudinal variables can be ruled out as explanatory factors as they are
constant within each individual.

ESM Mitigates Memory (i.e., Retrospective) Biases
Data collected using traditional one-time surveys and/or interviews are based on people’s
summaries of their experiences and behaviors, which are prone to recall errors (Kraiger &
Aguinis, 2001; Stone, Shiffman, & DeVries, 1999). Traditional surveys that ask participants
to reflect on their past behaviors or report on the nature and frequency of events generate data
whose precision is compromised, as remembering these experiences is a fairly challenging
memory recall task (Robinson & Clore, 2002). It has been argued that memory works best in
situations when retrieval happens in the same context (time and place) as when the experience
is being encoded in the memory (Anderson, 1990; Rugg & Wilding, 2000). ESM minimizes the
memory biases found in traditional surveys because ESM allows researchers to assess shortlived processes, states, and events as they happen in real time (Beal & Weiss, 2003).
Entrepreneurs function in environments that are usually unpredictable and ambiguous
(e.g., Lichtenstein, Dooley, & Lumpkin, 2006), which make it difficult for them to recall
and describe details of what researchers aim to understand from them. For example, Shane
(2000) conducted in-depth interviews and demonstrated that individuals discover opportunities in areas related to their prior knowledge. However, because participants’ responses in

<-----Page 7----->Uy et al. / Experience Sampling Methodology and Entrepreneurship

37

interviews are based on retrospection, they could have rationalized the discovery process
and fail to include critical information about their experiences at that time the opportunity
was discovered. In yet another study, Baron and Ensley (2006) asked entrepreneurs to
describe the ideas on which their new ventures were based and why these ideas were worth
pursuing. Despite the study’s contributions, because memory is subject to considerable distortions and changes over time, asking participants to recall events that happened in the past
are indirect evidence at best (Schacter, Norman, & Koutstaal, 1998).
Researchers that probe processes using one-time questionnaires must be wary that entrepreneurs may not distinguish among the actual event that occurred, from their personal
wishes, and from social expectancies that could influence their reports. Asking entrepreneurs to summarize their experiences and behaviors might not accurately reflect the actual
course of events of the entrepreneurial process. ESM can account for factors relevant to this
process before they are altered by self-reflection (Hektner et al., 2007), and ESM achieves
this by assessing experiences as they unfold in situ (Beal & Weiss, 2003).

Designing and Implementing ESM in Entrepreneurship Research
The previous section explained many benefits that can be accrued by using ESM to
advance entrepreneurship theory and research. However, we candidly acknowledge that
ESM studies can entail a considerable amount of time, energy, and resources from both
researchers and participants compared to more traditional methods (e.g., one-time survey
administered online). On the part of researchers, the high cost to implement these studies
could be seen as a major difficulty. On the side of participants, they have to deal with the
burden of response compliance imposed by this methodology, which can also be a practical
hurdle. As is the case with any proposal including innovative and high-involvement
research design approaches (Grant & Wall, in press), implementation is a key issue. We are
fully aware that researchers are not likely to use ESM, or any other innovative
methodological approach, in the absence of detailed practical guidelines. Accordingly, in
this section, we discuss some of the major issues in designing and implementing ESM in
entrepreneurship research using cell phone technology. These include sample size and the
ESM survey, device and signaling schedules, and participant recruitment and orientation
issues. Finally, we describe the resulting data structure and provide recommendations
regarding data analysis strategies. Figure 1 includes a flow chart summarizing the steps
involved in implementing an ESM study.
Our purpose is to stimulate scholars to generate their own research questions that can be
examined using this methodology. We use the research question ‘‘How does the entrepreneur’s affect influence effort?’’ as a concrete example to explain the logistics of implementing an ESM study from designing the ESM survey to data analysis. Elaborating on the
theoretical foundations for this illustrative question is beyond the scope or purpose of our
methodological implementation description. It suffices to note that entrepreneurs who
experience negative affect should exert more effort (Carver, 2003) because negative affect
signals that things are not going well at the moment and something needs to be done to correct the situation. Studying affect requires a methodological approach that can assess an
entrepreneur’s state at many points in time rather than assume that affect remains constant.

Sample Size and the ESM Survey
Because of the amount of effort involved in the data collection process, most ESM studies have samples of participants that are considered modest in size by social science
research standards (Aguinis & Harden, 2009). Nonetheless, because participants are
required to respond at multiple times during the study, the total sample size (i.e., the total

<-----Page 9----->Uy et al. / Experience Sampling Methodology and Entrepreneurship

39

number of data points) is usually sufficient in statistical analyses that model within-individual
relationships. The sampling involved in ESM studies pertains to sampling data from cases; in
other words, gathering multiple reports on the experience of the same set of participants over
the course of the study. For example, the number of participants in the study by Ilies and
Judge (2002) was only 27, but they obtained a total of 1,907 ESM ratings of mood and job
satisfaction. Researchers can conduct a multilevel power analysis (Snijders & Bosker,
1999; see Scherbaum & Ferreter, 2009, for a detailed introduction) to determine the number
of participants and the frequency of responses required per participant, while bearing in mind
the level of response burden placed on the participants.
In designing the ESM survey, it is important to take into account the research question
being addressed and the variables being examined. ESM surveys can capture internal and
external dimensions of the phenomenon of interest. For example, in studying the affect and
venture effort relationships over time, the ESM survey should have items that ask entrepreneurs to evaluate their affect at that particular moment and the extent to which they are
engaged in venture-related tasks. In addition, if researchers are interested to know how
external factors might impact the affect–effort relationship, the ESM surveys can also ask
participants to provide information on elements of their current situation such as where they
are at that moment and whether they are alone or with other people.
Given the nature of ESM studies, researchers have to strike a balance between obtaining
enough information and not overburdening participants. Typically, ESM surveys that can
be completed in 2 min or less are considered reasonable (Hektner et al., 2007). In the example of affect and venture effort, the main items in the ESM survey are affect and effort
assessments. The shortened Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; Watson, Clark,
& Tellegen, 1988) can be used to measure affect. Shortened versions are routinely used
in ESM studies to ease participant burden (e.g., Song, Foo, & Uy, 2008; Zohar, Tzischinski,
& Epstein, 2003). Moreover, although not without controversy (e.g., Wanous & Hudy,
2001; Warren & Landis, 2007), the use of single-item scales is common in experience sampling studies (e.g., Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace, 2006; Williams & Alliger, 1994)
because of the effort required of participants to respond to each survey item at multiple
times. In examining venture efforts, researchers can ask participants to report how much
effort they put into venture tasks that are required immediately and how much effort they
put into venture tasks beyond what is immediately required. Both affect and venture efforts
are captured using Likert-type measures (based on a 5-point scale), which do not impose
much difficulty for participants to comply and provide sufficient range to minimize detrimental effects of scale coarseness (Aguinis, Pierce, & Culpepper, in press). Figure 2 shows
sample screen shots as they appear on participants’ cell phones.

Scheduling and Signaling Devices
The frequency and interval of the signals and the study duration depend on the research
goals. There are no clear-cut rules for setting intervals, and scholars should consider theoryrelated and practical issues including the effect of time on the variables measured, participant burden, and the type of statistical analyses to be used (Hektner et al., 2007). Signaling
schedules are typically randomized within the day (Larson & Richards, 1994). Researchers
generate the ESM schedule by determining the participants’ waking hours and reasonable

<-----Page 10----->40 Organizational Research Methods

time periods to prompt them to respond without being too disruptive. For example, in examining the affective influences on venture efforts, an ESM schedule between 10 a.m. to
10 p.m. can be adopted because we want to survey entrepreneurs during their typical work
hours. An ESM schedule that includes extremely late hours would be too intrusive even
though entrepreneurs might work erratic hours.
The earliest ESM studies were conducted using paper and pencil in which participants
carry the questionnaire booklet and complete the required questions at random intervals
as prompted by a portable electronic device such as beepers and programmable wrist
watches (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1987; Fisher, 2000, 2002; Marco & Suls,
1993—as a side note, the third author, HA, of this article was one of the participants in the
Marco & Suls, 1993 study, so we understand the burden placed on participants in a very
vivid and personal way). Such procedures have a number of limitations including the inability to assess compliance accurately, difficulty in data management (i.e., encoding data by
hand introduces human error), and failure to rule out sampling bias because there is no foolproof way to check the time gap between the random prompts and when the participant
actually responded (Feldman Barrett & Barrett, 2001). With technological advances,
researchers have opted for computerized ESMs such as the use of personal digital assistants
(PDAs) and handheld computers or palmtops (e.g., Miner, Glomb, & Hulin, 2005) as well
as web-based ESM procedures, which require participants to go online and encode their

<-----Page 11----->Uy et al. / Experience Sampling Methodology and Entrepreneurship

41

responses on the researchers’ Web site (e.g., Judge & Ilies, 2004). These types of computerized ESMs have a number of advantages including precisely controlled signal timing,
objective compliance tracking, and reduced human error in data management (Feldman
Barrett & Barrett, 2001; Shiffman, 2000). Computerized ESMs also allow researchers to
obtain ancillary information such as the time gaps between the prompt and response which
could provide additional insights on the phenomenon of interest.
Computerized ESM might be better than paper-and-pencil ESM because many entrepreneurs, especially those in business incubators, are familiar with portable electronic gadgets
and the Internet. However, existing computerized ESM employing PDAs and web-based
procedures have some limitations. Not all entrepreneurs have PDAs and researchers have
to purchase these expensive devices and lend them to the entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs
could also find it inconvenient to carry an extra device, and this gadget might be left at
home. Web-based procedures where entrepreneurs log on to the researchers’ Web site to
provide their responses could pose some difficulties as entrepreneurs might not have access
to the Internet at all times. Although compliance can be objectively assessed for PDAs and
web-based procedures, researchers cannot perform real-time tracking of responses. Moreover, in both types of computerized ESM, researchers cannot interact with the entrepreneurs
immediately and resolve issues at the moment when they occur, and this could negatively
affect response rates.

ESM and Cell Phones
To overcome some of the limitations associated with the devices described earlier, we
developed a cell phone based ESM. Cell phones have wireless application protocol (WAP)
features allowing researchers to embed survey items (usually as an application programmed
in Java) on the cell phones (Song et al., 2008; Vos & de Klein, 2002). The use of cell phones
in entrepreneurship ESM studies has all the advantages of computerized ESM mentioned
earlier and addresses the challenges attached to the use of PDAs and web-based procedures.
For one, practically every entrepreneur owns a cell phone and they rely on their cell phones
as part of their day-to-day functioning. Thus, in terms of familiarity and ease of use, cell
phones clearly prevail over PDAs.
With cell phones, participant responses are immediately transmitted, which allow
researchers to track participant compliance in real-time. Moreover, this technology allows
for real-time interactive contact with entrepreneurs. For example, researchers can personally call the participants to get feedback and resolve compliance issues. If the entrepreneur
accidentally deletes the survey application, the participant can inform the researcher immediately, and the latter can transmit a new application at once (using WAP), which could help
boost response rates. Such interactive features may not be available in PDA and web-based
procedures. In addition, the wireless networking feature in cell phones simplifies the
researchers’ task because responses can be directly transmitted into a researcher’s computer, unlike in PDAs where entrepreneurs have to bring the gadgets to the researcher’s
office for data transfers (i.e., uploading or ‘‘hot syncing’’ the data; Feldman Barrett &
Barrett, 2001). Table 1 summarizes the advantages of using cell phones in ESM in relationship to existing computerized ESMs (PDAs and web-based platforms).

In ESM with cell phones, researchers can prompt entrepreneurs to complete the survey by
sending a text reminder (these reminders are prescheduled by the researchers; Song et al.,
2008), and entrepreneurs respond by opening the survey application in their cell phones, completing the survey, and sending the completed survey to a telephone number, which receives
all the responses (‘‘system number’’). Their answers are received by the researcher’s computer as a text message or short message service (SMS). Technical details of using cell phones
in ESM are outlined in Appendix. A challenge of using cell phones involves phone compatibility because each phone model has a unique application programming interface (API), and
there can be instances when the survey application cannot be launched on the entrepreneur’s
phone (Chu, Song, Wong, Kurakake, & Katagiri, 2004). Fortunately, this problem can be
resolved by adjusting the API to fit a particular phone model, and based on our experience,
this is a relatively simple programming task, which can be handled by a knowledgeable computer programmer. There are other issues such as the cell phone network traffic, which can
cause delays and even loss of information in the course of sending and receiving SMSs, but
these are not within the control of the researchers. Nonetheless, telecommunication companies have to adhere to strict service quality standards, and therefore, the downside of congested network traffics are experienced rather infrequently.

Participant Recruitment and Orientation
Recruiting entrepreneurs to participate in ESM studies can be a challenging task because
of the considerable effort required of participants. An ideal situation to conduct ESM studies is one in which researchers have access to a captive audience. To examine the affective
influences in venture efforts among start-up entrepreneurs, researchers can recruit participants in business incubators. Because these entrepreneurs are housed in one location, it is
easier for researchers to interact with them and in the process earn their trust, confidence,
and subsequently increase response rates (Uy, 2009). In our experience, many of the
incubators are high-tech business incubators that accommodate high-tech start-up entrepreneurs who are familiar with electronic gadgets (e.g., cell phones). Although it is not always
possible to get a group of entrepreneurs housed in one location, the key issue is to recruit
entrepreneurs who are motivated to participate in the study. One such example is to recruit
entrepreneurs affiliated with entrepreneurship centers of universities and academic institutions, as well as participants of business plan competitions. These individuals value
entrepreneurship in an academic environment and might be more willing to be research
participants. This approach of recruiting entrepreneurs has its drawbacks as the results may
not be generalized to the population of entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, these entrepreneurs
provide a good starting point to understand process and within-individual issues in entrepreneurship. Moreover, our illustration is designed so that a single researcher with limited time
and monetary resources can conduct the research. A research team with greater resources
may be able to conduct ESM on a random sample of entrepreneurs.
Prospective participants might be apprehensive of the inconvenience that ESM procedures inflict and the seemingly intrusive nature of the protocols (Hektner et al., 2007).
Researchers can overcome these potential difficulties through the orientation. Researchers
should clarify the research goals, orient participants about the mechanics and duration of the
study, and teach them how to complete the ESM surveys. In addition, researchers should

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 14----->44 Organizational Research Methods

handle the orientation professionally but with a tinge of personal touch to make the entrepreneurs feel that their participation constitutes an integral part of the research endeavor. It
is also critical for researchers to be personally available for logistical and technical assistance in the course of the study, and to provide verbal encouragement and support consistently throughout the study (e.g., Alliger & Williams, 1993; Larson & Csikszentmihalyi,
1983). Doing so will motivate participants to remain engaged until the end of the study,
boost response rates, and ensure data quality. Past ESM studies provide evidence that
recruiting busy people such as working parents with children (e.g., Williams & Alliger,
1994) and hospital residents (e.g., Zohar et al., 2003) is possible as long as researchers are
diligent in establishing good relationships with their respective participants.
Using the cell phone-based ESM to study the affect and venture effort relationship would
require the researcher to assist participants in installing the ESM survey in their respective
phones (please refer to Appendix for the installation procedures). The researcher must
explain every item in the ESM survey to prevent any confusion or misinterpretation. Participants are instructed to download and install the ESM survey in their phones and not to
delete it until the end of the study. Moreover, the researcher can also administer background
information surveys in the orientation by asking participants to provide demographic and
venture-related information, which can be incorporated in the data analysis. For example,
in the entrepreneurial affect–effort study, dispositional factors and venture information can
be measured during the orientation before the start of the ESM study. It is also important to
conduct a debriefing at the end of the study and ask participants about the overall experience of completing the ESM study—whether they had compliance difficulty or whether
they found the whole procedure to be too disruptive. Pilot tests and well-conducted orientation sessions can minimize unpleasant participant feedback in the debriefing.
Although the steps listed above may seem logistically overwhelming at first glance,
the resources needed in conducting ESM studies are actually reasonable. The researcher
will need to dedicate about 2 weeks for recruitment and orientation, and the next 2 weeks
will involve implementing the study and closely monitoring the participants’ compliance. It
is important for the researcher to be constantly available to assist participants and address
their issues for the whole 4 weeks to ensure smooth implementation and compliance with
the research protocol. In terms of budget, the main costs include the development of the
ESM survey and the tokens of appreciation for the participants. We obtained a quote of
US$800 from a company to program the ESM survey in a form that can be installed in the
participants’ cell phones. Given the 50–60 participants typical in ESM studies, and an average of US$40–50 per participant as a token of appreciation, the total cost including survey
development is about US$3,000–4,000.

Data Structure and Analysis
The process of data collection using cell phone ESM is extremely efficient because
researchers can automatically transfer the ESM data to the statistical package without the
need for manual encoding. In addition, because all reminders and responses include date
and time stamps, researchers can determine which responses are valid. For example, consistent with other ESM studies (e.g., Judge & Ilies, 2004), a 2-hr window can be a

Affect1 Affect2 Effort

Note: To analyze the influence of affect on effort, the following xtmixed command can be used in Stata 9:
xtmixed effort affect | | participantID. To analyze the moderating effect of prior experience on affect and effort,
the following command can be used: xtmixed effort affect experience affectXexperience | | participantID. For
detailed information on fixed and random options and other mixed model commands available in Stata 9, please
see Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2005). ID ¼ identification.

reasonable time frame such that responses received beyond 2 hr after the signal or text
prompt has been sent are considered invalid.
For our example on affect predicting venture effort, we can have two sets of data. The
first set is the response-level data (or Level 1 data), which include affect and venture efforts
assessed via cell phone based ESM. The second set consists of person-level data (or Level 2
data) such as gender, ethnicity/race, age, industry of business venture, and other dispositional factors obtained from the background information survey administered in the orientation. The two sets can be merged by means of a unique identifier, which in most cases is
the participant’s identification (ID) number. The ESM data structure is stacked such that
multiple observations for each participant are stacked on top of one another. Therefore,
each ESM response occupies one data row, and the number of data rows for each participant
equals to the number of ESM responses for that participant. Table 2 illustrates how the
stacked data structure might look like.
Given the hierarchical structure of the ESM data with multiple responses nested within
individuals, multilevel modeling is an appropriate statistical methodology to analyze the
data (Bliese, Chan, & Ployhart, 2007; Klein & Kozlowski, 2000). Multilevel modeling

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 16----->46 Organizational Research Methods

takes into account the correlated structure of the data as multiple reports are obtained from
the same person over the course of the ESM study (Walls & Schafer, 2006). It is also
equipped to handle nested data with unequal number of observations across individuals
as well as irregular intervals between observations (Nezlek, 2001). A number of statistical
programs (e.g., HLM, Mplus, SAS, SPSS, Stata) have multilevel modeling features that can
be used to analyze ESM data. A situational factor that might influence the affect–effort
relationship among entrepreneurs is prior experience. Prior experience might weaken the
relationship between affect and effort because the entrepreneur can draw from past experiences to determine the amount of required effort and dilute the informational content of
affect (Forgas, 1995). In Table 2, we include some examples of commands in Stata 9 that
can be used in conducting the analyses. Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2005) provide detailed
information regarding these commands and other multilevel modeling procedures in Stata.
Moreover, because ESM accommodates temporal order, researchers can incorporate
lagged effects to test the directionality of the relationships. Using the example on affect and
venture effort, researchers can test whether affect predicts subsequent venture effort.
Researchers can also test whether venture effort influences the entrepreneur’s affect the
following day. Although ESM data can be used to test temporal effects, researchers must
exercise caution in inferring causality (Beal & Weiss, 2003) because temporal sequencing
is a necessary but not sufficient condition, and causality can only be inferred if one can rule
out other possible alternative explanations.
The steps involved in implementing ESM as summarized in Figure 1 refer to our specific
example. These steps can be applied more broadly to other questions in entrepreneurship
research. For example, for the question of how the entrepreneurs’ social interaction frequency predicts venture sales, similar steps as shown in Figure 1 can be used, except that
this can be an event-contingent ESM in which entrepreneurs complete the ESM survey
immediately after a significant social interaction occurs (e.g., meeting with investors, suppliers). Just like our illustrative example, direct and reverse relationships can be tested to
ascertain the directionality of the relationships of these dynamic variables, and different
lagged outcomes can be modeled in the analysis to examine the stability of the effects.

Discussion
A large body of literature in entrepreneurship research emphasizes the importance of the
entrepreneur ‘‘in whose mind all of the possibilities come together, who believes that innovation is possible, and who has the motivation to persist until the job is done’’ (Shaver & Scott,
1991, p. 39). The entrepreneurship field needs more rigorous empirical studies that assess
how entrepreneurs discover, evaluate, and implement business ideas (Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000). However, important phenomena in entrepreneurship research cannot
be adequately examined if we continue to use traditional methodologies, particularly crosssectional designs including one-time data collection via surveys and/or interviews.
Moreover, important advances in data analytic approaches (Dean, Shook, & Payne, 2007)
cannot overcome design and measurement limitations inherent in many data sets. In fact,
Aguinis, Pierce, Bosco, and Muslin (2009) reported that more than half of the authors of the
25 most frequently cited articles published in Academy of Management Review from 1987 to

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 17----->Uy et al. / Experience Sampling Methodology and Entrepreneurship

47

2007 indicated that innovations in research design, rather than data analysis, are needed to
make important theory-based advancements in the organizational sciences.
ESM can address research questions that probe into how entrepreneurs think and feel,
and what motivates them as they are experienced in situ. In exploring how entrepreneurs
think, for example, researchers want to know why, when, and how entrepreneurs decide
favorably on the opportunities they discover because not all discovered opportunities are
implemented. To examine this phenomenon, it would be necessary to account for possible
predictors of opportunity discovery such as the content of the entrepreneur’s thought, (i.e.,
their object of focus, which might include information on the technology, the customer),
their temporal focus, how new information is incorporated with prior knowledge, and how
changes in these cognitive factors over time affect venture-relevant decisions. Moreover,
because affect plays a significant role in how information is selected and interpreted (Isen
& Labroo, 2003; Mellers, 2000; Wegener & Petty, 1994), entrepreneurial affect may be
critical in venture decisions (Baron, 2008). Affective influences are salient to entrepreneurs as they have to cope with stress brought about by the ambiguity and complexity
of the entrepreneurial environment (Aldrich & Martinez, 2001). ESM can track affective
experiences of entrepreneurs as they unfold, and changes in entrepreneurial affect and
their impact on venture efforts can be modeled using ESM data. Lastly, factors relevant
to entrepreneurial motivation such as passion and drive are not static. These motivational
factors vary at each stage of the venture process and continue to change as the entrepreneur transitions from the nascent stage to the start-up and on to the growth phase (Shane
et al., 2003). Using ESM, scholars can examine issues such as entrepreneurial passion
(Cardon, Wincent, Singh, & Drnovsek, in press; Cardon, Zietsma, Saparito, Matherne,
& Davis, 2005) in situ to improve our understanding of these processes and consequently
advance entrepreneurship theory.
ESM can be adopted to explore other important questions in entrepreneurship research.
For example, the work-family interface is highly salient for entrepreneurs because achieving a balance between work and family is one of the factors that motivate individuals to start
their own businesses (Boden, 1999; DeMartino & Barbato, 2003). ESM can be used to test
theoretical frameworks in entrepreneurship that incorporate work and family considerations
(e.g., Jennings & McDougald, 2007). ESM studies can be designed to assess independent
variables such as how changes in the entrepreneurs’ work-family experiences and attitudes
(such as work and family satisfaction) influence outcomes such as coping strategies and
psychological well-being. These dynamic data can be further analyzed alongside data
collected from one-time initial surveys on their work and family orientation, family
background (e.g., number of children, socioeconomic status), and secondary data on the
financial performance of the venture. ESM can also be used to examine how entrepreneurs
cope with business failures. Researchers can use ESM to track what happens after the entrepreneur’s business venture folds up, how various emotional reactions predict the way they
cope with business failure, how they bounce back and learn from this experience—whether
they start a new venture immediately or take a hiatus from activities related to new venture
creation.
Importantly, ESM can be used together with other methods (Scollon et al., 2003), such
as one-time and multiple-wave surveys. For example, researchers can examine how stress

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 18----->48 Organizational Research Methods

(a dynamic predictor) together with the entrepreneurs’ characteristics (stable predictors
as they do not change during the ESM study) influences an entrepreneurs’ well-being (a
dynamic outcome variable). Characteristics collected using traditional surveys include the
entrepreneurs’ motives for starting a business, and the extent to which they believe they can
achieve certain milestones in their start-up ventures, such as attracting customers, hiring
new employees, and enticing prospective investors (cf. Panel Study of Entrepreneurial
Dynamics or PSED survey, Reynolds, 2000). In this particular example, entrepreneurs who
believe they can meet their milestones may cope with stress more effectively and report better well-being. Information on the person and situation variables can be gathered not just
from the entrepreneur but also from other people such as members of the entrepreneurial
team, venture capitalists, customers, suppliers, and family members. ESM can also be used
to augment similar repeated measures studies such as paper-and-pencil diary studies (cf.
Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003 for a review of the use of diary studies), repeated interviews
(e.g., Delmar & Wiklund, 2008), as well as experiments and verbal protocols (e.g., Brundin,
Patzelt, & Shepherd, 2008).
ESM has potential to contribute to the advancement of entrepreneurship theory and can
also offer insights into entrepreneurship practice. For example, the rich quality of ESM data
can inform us regarding which dynamic elements attributed to the individual and opportunity
matter in the opportunity recognition process. Being aware of this process is important not
just for aspiring entrepreneurs but also for incumbents. For example, if ESM studies reveal
that positive affect facilitates opportunity discovery, entrepreneurs can engage in activities
to experience more positive affect. Knowledge gained from ESM studies can also benefit
entrepreneurship educators, directors, and executive teams of entrepreneurship centers, as
well as business incubator heads to design interventions and activities that promote sound
entrepreneurship practice. For instance, we can use ESM to track entrepreneurs in business
incubators to understand the processes that entrepreneurs go through and their needs and
concerns while in the incubation program. Entrepreneurship educators can incorporate findings about how entrepreneurs deal with various issues, such as stress, over time, in their
entrepreneurship classes.
We acknowledge several implementation issues that make ESM a challenging methodology to use, such as the high level of commitment it requires of the participants and the
amount of resources needed by the researchers. Because ESM is a time and resource intensive methodology, we suggest practical steps on how these issues can be addressed.
Although acknowledging that ESM is not without drawbacks, we encourage entrepreneurship scholars to expand on their methodological toolkit by considering ESM and to take
advantage of cell phones and wireless network technologies.
In closing, our goals are to demonstrate that ESM can be used to advance entrepreneurship
theory and research by capitalizing on its methodological strengths, and to recommend ways
to overcome the challenges of implementing ESM in entrepreneurship research. As noted by
Brundin, ‘‘The use of real-time process studies represents one way to capture entrepreneurial
activities as they happen and be able to uncover the more intangible, yet very important,
issues in the daily life of the entrepreneur’’ (2007, p. 279). Indeed, ESM represents such
real-time process studies that allow researchers to gather data that capture processes and
dynamic person-by-situation interactions over time in a unique and valuable way.

Appendix
Technical Details on Conducting Cell Phone ESM Studies in
Entrepreneurship
Researchers who are interested in implementing ESM using cell phones may need to hire a knowledgeable computer programmer who can program the survey in Java language and upload it to a Web
site that will serve as the host site for the study. Researchers also need to secure a cell phone subscriber identity module (SIM) card (i.e., the memory chip used to activate the cell phone), which will
serve as the ‘‘system number’’ for the study. The system number will be the main contact number of
the researchers which participants can access anytime during the course of the study. The SIM card
will be placed in a modem that will be connected to the researchers’ computer where the main software is installed. The programmer should be able to develop a program that would send and receive
text messages or short message service (SMS), and this program will be linked to the system number
that will be used to interact with the participants and collate all their responses in a master database.
The program should allow researchers to preset the schedules of when participants receive the SMS
alerts for the duration of the study.
To install the survey application into the cell phones, participants must first activate the General
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) feature of their cell phones. Most cell phone models have a GPRS
feature albeit not automatically activated. Activation is free of charge and is usually done through
the mobile service providers. Once the cell phone is GPRS-ready, the researchers can send the survey application by sending a wireless application protocol (WAP) push to the participants’ cell
phones. A WAP push is an encoded message that includes a link to the address where the survey
is hosted. When the participants receive the WAP push, they can access the link and download the
survey application into their cell phones. Alternatively, if the participant’s cell phones have the
integrated Bluetooth feature, researchers will have a much easier way of embedding the survey
application into the participants’ cell phones. To do this, participants must first switch on the Bluetooth feature of their cell phones, and then the researcher activates the Bluetooth of the master
computer and identifies the cell phones of the participants as the target destination of the survey
application.
Once the participants have successfully downloaded and saved the survey application into their
respective cell phones, the ESM survey can begin. Participants are prompted to complete the cell
phone survey by the SMS reminder sent through the master computer. They open the application and
complete the survey using their cell phones. At the end of the survey, a question will appear on the
screen asking if responses are ready to be sent to the system number. Participants must click yes and
their responses will be sent to the researcher’s computer in a form of an SMS. The following diagram
(Figure A1) displays the architecture of the ESM via cell phone study process:
