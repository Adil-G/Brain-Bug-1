CLASSIFICATION

OF DECISION

MODELS

Most decisionmodelsforcomparingdistributions
ofreturnscan be
classifiedaccordingto two dichotomies.The firstdichotomydistinguishesbetweenparametricmodelsand expectedutilitymodels.Parametricmodelsare explicitly
based on momentsand otheraspectsofthe
returnsdistributions
as illustratedabove. Utilitymodelsare based on

This dichotomy

of much of the behavioralresearchand will be our major topic of
discussion.

The second dichotomydistinguishesbetweenpartial-order(dominance) models and weak-ordermodels. In a dominancemodel,the
"betterthan"relationP is transitive,so thatFPH wheneverFPG and
GPH. An example is the familiarmean-variancedominancemodel
(Markowitz[1952;1959],Tobin [1958;1965],Sharpe [1963;1964],and
manyothers)in whichFPG ifand onlyif(pF > uG and oaF - 0G) or (pF

AND P. C. FISHBURN

Since the weak-orderingmodels provide a more completedescription
of preference,they have been emphasized in the behavioral research.
They will be emphasized here as well. It should be kept in mind that
each parametric weak-ordermodel that uses two or more parameters
has a correspondingparametric dominance form. If a,, a2, -_are
parameter functions whose larger values are preferredto smaller
are parameter functionswhose smaller values
values, and b,, b2,
are preferredto larger values, then the dominance model for these
parameters has FPG when aj(F) > ai(G) for each i; bj(F) C bj(G) for
eachj; and eitheraj(F) > ac(G) forsome i or bj(F) < bj(G) forsomej.
...

PARAMETRIC

WEAK-ORDER

MODELS

Parametric weak-ordermodels can be classifiedaccordingto whether
the model accounts for differencesamong individual decision makers
and accordingto whetherthe model is based on one or several parameters. The multiple-parameterweak-ordermodels are furtherdivided
into compensatorymodels and noncompensatorymodels. Generally
speaking, compensatorymodels allow trade-offsamong parameters,
whereas noncompensatorymodels impose an importanceorderingon
parameters that prohibittrade-offs.Figure 1 illustrates this classification scheme forthe parametricweak-ordermodels.
Two ofthe three single-parametermodels in figure1- the maximum
expected return model with FPG if and only if uF > uG, and the
minimum loss probability model with FPG if and only if F(O-) <
G(O-) -do not account forindividual differences.The maximum probability of target returnmodel, withFPG if and only if 1 - F(xt-) > 1 G(xt-), accounts forindividual differenceswhen the target returnxt is
specifiedby the decision maker.
Although the single-parametermodels are the simplest of those in
figure1-in terms of estimation,computation,and communicabilitytheir descriptivepowers are limited. The inability of single-parameter
models to reflectmultiple concernsof a decision maker has given rise
to a number of multiple-parametermodels that, at the very least,
recognize explicitly the desire for high return coupled with a low
degree ofrisk.
