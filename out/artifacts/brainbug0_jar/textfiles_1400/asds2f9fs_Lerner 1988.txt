Abstract
Within the past few years, public eorts have sought to encourage individual, or ``angel'', investors. This article provides an overview of the motivations for these eorts. It
assesses the underlying challenges that the ®nancing of young growth ®rms pose, the
ways that specialized ®nancial intermediaries address them, and the rationales for public
eorts to encourage angel investors. The ®nal section raises a set of questions about the
practical implementation of these eorts. Ó 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
The federal government has played an active role in ®nancing new ®rms,
particularly in high-technology industries, since the Soviet Union's launch
of the Sputnik satellite. In recent years, European and Asian nations and
many US states have adopted similar initiatives. While these programs' precise
structures have diered, the eorts have been predicated on two shared

assumptions: (i) that the private sector provides insucient capital to new
®rms, and (ii) that the government can identify ®rms in which investments will
ultimately yield high social and/or private returns or else encourage private-sector parties who can do so. 1 In contrast to many forms of government intervention to boost economic growth, such as privatization programs, these claims
have received little scrutiny by economists. (Three recent exceptions are Irwin
and Klenow, 1996; Lerner, 1996; Wallsten, 1996.)
The neglect of these questions is unfortunate. While the sums of money involved are modest relative to public expenditures on defense procurement or
retiree bene®ts, these programs are very substantial when compared to contemporaneous private investments in new ®rms. Several examples, documented in
Lerner (1996), underscore this point.
· The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program led to the provision of more than $3 billion to young ®rms between 1958 and 1969, more
than three times the total private venture capital investment during these
years (Noone and Rubel, 1970).
· In 1995, the sum of the equity ®nancing provided through and guaranteed
by public small business ®nancing programs in the United States was $2.4
billion, more than 60% of the amount disbursed by traditional venture funds
in that year. Perhaps more signi®cantly, the bulk of the public funds were for
early-stage ®rms, which in the past decade have only accounted for about
30% of the disbursements by independent venture capital funds (Venture
Economics, 1996).
· Some of America's most dynamic technology companies received support
through the SBIC and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs while still private entities, including Apple Computer, Chiron, Compaq, Federal Express, and Intel.
· Public venture capital programs have also had a signi®cant impact overseas:
e.g., Germany has created about 800 federal and state government ®nancing
programs for new ®rms over the past two decades, which provide the bulk of
the ®nancing for technology-intensive start-ups (Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, 1995).
Government programs in this arena have been divided between those eorts
that directly fund entrepreneurial ®rms and those that encourage or subsidize
the development of outside investors. The eorts to encourage outside inves-

It is striking to note the similar emphasis on these rationales in, for instance, the statement of
Senator John Sparkman (Sparkman, 1958) upon the passage of the Small Business Investment Act
and the recent testimony of Dr. Mary Good, Under Secretary for Technology at the US
Department of Commerce (Good, 1995). The rationales for such programs are discussed in depth in
US Congressional Budget Oce (1985).

tors have historically focused on the development of community loan funds
and venture capital organizations.
Within the past few years, however, public ocials in the United States on
both a national and local level have increasingly sought to encourage another
type of ®nancier: the individual, or ``angel'', investor. The most visible of these
eorts has been the Angel Capital Network (ACE-Net), introduced by the US
Small Business Administration's Oce of Advocacy. This Internet forum allows small businesses to post business plans and communicate with accredited
investors. (For an overview, see US Small Business Administration, Oce of
Advocacy, 1996b.)
This article will provide an overview of the motivations for these eorts to
encourage individual investors. In Section 2, the underlying challenges that
the ®nancing of young growth ®rms pose are discussed, as well as the ways that
specialized ®nancial intermediaries address them. The rationales for encouraging angel investors are explored and assessed in Section 3. Section 4 concludes
the paper and raises a set of questions about the practical implementation of
these eorts.
2. The challenge of ®nancing young ®rms
The initial reaction of a ®nancial economist to the argument that the government needs to encourage investments by individuals in young ®rms is likely to
be skepticism. A lengthy literature has highlighted the role of ®nancial intermediaries in alleviating moral hazard and information asymmetries. Young ®rms,
particularly those in high-technology industries that are the focus of many of
today's policy initiatives, are often characterized by considerable uncertainty
and informational asymmetries that permit opportunistic behavior by entrepreneurs. Why one would want to encourage amateur individual investors instead of specialized ®nancial intermediaries (venture capital organizations) as a
source of capital in this setting is not immediately obvious.
To brie¯y review the types of con¯icts that can emerge in these settings, 2
Jensen and Meckling (1976) demonstrate that agency con¯icts between managers and investors can aect the willingness of both debt and equity holders to
provide capital. If the ®rm raises equity from outside investors, the manager
has an incentive to engage in wasteful expenditures (e.g., lavish oces) because
he may bene®t disproportionately from these but does not bear their entire
cost. Similarly, if the ®rm raises debt, the manager may increase risk to undesirable levels. Because providers of capital recognize these problems, outside

<-----Page 3----->776

investors demand a higher rate of return than would be the case if the funds
were internally generated.
Even if the manager is motivated to maximize shareholder value, informational asymmetries may make raising external capital more expensive or even
preclude it entirely. Myers and Majluf (1984) and Greenwald et al. (1984) demonstrate that equity oerings of ®rms may be associated with a ``lemons'' problem (®rst identi®ed by Akerlof, 1970). If the manager is better informed about
the investment opportunities of the ®rm and acts in the interest of current
shareholders, then managers only issue new shares when the company's stock
is overvalued. Indeed, numerous studies have documented that stock prices decline upon the announcement of equity issues, largely because of the negative
signal that it sends to the market.
These information problems have also been shown to exist in debt markets.
Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) show that if banks ®nd it dicult to discriminate
among companies, raising interest rates can have perverse selection eects.
In particular, the high interest rates discourage all but the highest-risk borrowers, so the quality of the loan pool declines markedly. To address this
problem, banks may restrict the amount of lending rather than increasing interest rates.
These problems in the debt and equity markets are a consequence of the information gaps between the entrepreneurs and investors. If the information
asymmetries could be eliminated, ®nancing constraints would disappear. Financial economists argue that specialized ®nancial intermediaries, such as venture capital organizations, can address these problems. By intensively
scrutinizing ®rms before providing capital and then monitoring them afterwards, they can alleviate some of the information gaps and reduce capital constraints.
To address these information problems, the partners at venture capital organizations (venture capitalists) employ a variety of mechanisms. First, business
plans are intensively scrutinized: of those ®rms that submit business plans to
venture capital organizations, historically only 1% have been funded (Fenn
et al., 1995). The decision to invest is frequently made conditional on the identi®cation of a syndication partner who agrees that this is an attractive investment (Lerner, 1994). Once the decision to invest is made, the venture
capitalists frequently disburse funds in stages. Managers of these venturebacked ®rms are forced to return repeatedly to their ®nanciers for additional
capital, in order to ensure that the money is not squandered on unpro®table
projects. In addition, venture capitalists intensively monitor managers. These
investors demand preferred stock with numerous restrictive covenants and representation on the board of directors. (Various aspects of the oversight role
played by venture capitalists are documented in Gompers (1995), Lerner
(1995) and Sahlman (1990); the theoretical literature is reviewed in Barry
(1994).) Thus, it is not surprising that the capital provided by venture capital

<-----Page 4----->J. Lerner / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 773±783

777

organizations is the dominant form of equity ®nancing for privately held technology-intensive businesses. 3
3. Rationales for encouraging angel investors
At the same time, there are reasons to suspect that despite the presence of
venture capital funds, there still might be attractive companies that cannot
raise capital. In this section, I assess these claims. I highlight two sets of arguments: those based on the ®nance literature about capital constraints, as well as
on observations about the changing dynamics of the venture capital industry. 4
A growing body of empirical research suggests that new ®rms, especially
technology-intensive ones, may receive insucient capital. The literature on
capital constraints (reviewed in Hubbard, 1998) documents that an inability
to obtain external ®nancing limits many forms of business investment. Particularly relevant are works by Hall (1992), Hao and Jae (1993), and Himmelberg and Petersen (1994). These show that capital constraints appear to limit
research-and-development expenditures, especially in smaller ®rms.
However compelling the evidence for capital constraints limiting investments by small, technology-intensive ®rms, 5 these studies' relevance for policy-makers today is unclear. Many of these works examine ®rms during the
1970s and early 1980s, when the venture capital pool was relatively modest
in size. As discussed elsewhere in this volume (Gompers, 1998), the pool of venture capital funds has grown dramatically in recent years. Thus, even if small
high-technology ®rms had numerous value-creating projects that they could
not ®nance in the past, it is not clear that this problem remains today.
A second set of arguments are based on the perceived limitations of the venture capital industry. Venture capitalists fund a modest number of ®rms each
year, and these investments are highly concentrated. Furthermore, venture investors tend to only consider investing in ®rms that have a substantial need for
capital. I next review and assess these arguments.
Venture capitalists back only a tiny fraction of the technology-oriented businesses begun each year. In 1996, a record year for venture disbursements, 628
companies received venture ®nancing for the ®rst time (VentureOne, 1997). (By
way of comparison, the Small Business Administration estimates that in recent
3
While evidence regarding the ®nancing of these ®rms is imprecise, the survey of Freear and
Wetzel (1990) suggests that venture capital accounts for about two-thirds of the external equity
®nancing raised by privately held technology-intensive businesses from private-sector sources.
4
For a detailed presentation of the arguments for these initiatives, see US Small Business
Administration, Oce of Advocacy (1996a).
5
A related body of literature documents that investments in R&D yield high private and social
rates of return (e.g., Griliches, 1986; Mans®eld et al., 1977). These ®ndings similarly suggest that a
higher level of R&D spending would be desirable.

<-----Page 5----->778

years close to one million businesses have been started annually.) Furthermore,
these funds ± as in previous years ± have been very concentrated. 49% of venture funding in 1996 went to companies based in either California or Massachusetts; 82% went to ®rms specializing in information technology and the
life sciences (VentureOne, 1997).
It is not clear, however, what lessons to draw from these funding patterns.
Concentrating investments in such a manner may well be an appropriate response to the nature of opportunities. Consider, for instance, the geographic
concentration of awards. Recent models of economic growth ± building on earlier works by economic geographers ± have emphasized powerful reasons why
successful high-technology ®rms may be very concentrated. The literature highlights several factors that lead similar ®rms to cluster in particular regions, including knowledge spillovers, specialized labor markets, and the presence of
critical intermediate good producers. (The theoretical rationales for such eects
are summarized in Krugman, 1991.) Case studies of the development of hightechnology regions (e.g., Saxenian, 1994) have emphasized the importance of
intermediaries such as venture capitalists, lawyers, and accountants in facilitating such clustering.
A related argument for encouraging angel investors is that structure of venture investments may be inappropriate for many young ®rms. Venture funds
tend to make quite substantial investments, even in young ®rms. The mean
venture investment in a start-up or early-stage business between 1961 and
1992 (expressed in 1996 dollars) was $2.0 million (Gompers, 1995).
The substantial size of these investments may be partially a consequence of
the demands of institutional investors. The typical venture organization raises
a fund (structured as a limited partnership) every few years. Because investments in partnerships are often time-consuming to negotiate and monitor, institutions prefer making relatively large investments in venture funds (typically
$10 million or more). Furthermore, governance and regulatory considerations
lead institutions to limit the share of the fund that any one limited partner
holds. (The structure of venture partnerships is discussed at length in Gompers
and Lerner (1996).) These pressures lead venture organizations to raise substantial funds. Because each ®rm in his portfolio must be closely scrutinized,
the typical venture capitalist is typically responsible for no more than a dozen
investments. Venture organizations are consequently unwilling to invest in very
young ®rms that only require small capital infusions. 6
6
There are two primary reasons why venture funds do not simply hire more partners if they raise
additional capital. First, the supply of venture capitalists is quite inelastic. The eective oversight of
young companies requires highly specialized skills that can only be developed with years of
experience. A second important factor is the economics of venture partnerships. The typical venture
fund receives a substantial share of its compensation from the annual fee, which is typically
between 2% and 3% of the capital under management. This motivates venture organizations to
increase the capital that each partner manages.

This problem may be increasing in severity with the growth of the venture
industry. Private pension funds were essentially prohibited from venture investments by the US Department of Labor until 1978. Even after this policy shift,
private pensions did not invest in venture funds in signi®cant numbers until the
mid-1980s. A variety of regulatory and political factors restrained public pension funds from making substantial venture investments until the 1990s. (The
growth of the venture capital industry is documented and analyzed in Gompers
and Lerner (1996, 1997a) and summarized in this volume by Gompers (1998).)
As the number of dollars per venture fund and dollars per venture partner have
grown, so too has the size of venture investments: for instance, the mean ®nancing round for a start-up ®rm has climbed (in 1996 dollars) from $1.6 million in 1991 to $3.2 million in 1996 (VentureOne, 1997).
Again, it is not clear what lessons to draw from these ®nancing patterns.
Venture capitalists may have eschewed small investments because they were
simply not pro®table, because of either the high costs associated with these
transactions or the poor prospects of the thinly capitalized ®rms. (For a theoretical discussion of why poorly capitalized ®rms are less likely to be successful,
see Bolton and Scharfstein (1990).) Encouraging individuals to make such
small investments may be counter-productive and socially wasteful if the ®nancial returns are unsatisfactory and the companies ®nanced are not viable.
Support for these claims is found in recent work on the long-run performance of initial public oerings (IPOs). Brav and Gompers (1997) show that
IPOs that had previously received equity ®nancing from venture capitalists outperform other oerings, such as those ®rms who were backed by individual investors. Field (1996) shows that the long-run returns of IPOs are positively
correlated with the willingness of institutional (as opposed to individual) investors to purchases shares in the oering. Taken together, these ®ndings underscore concerns about policies which seek to encourage individuals to invest
in companies that are rejected by professional investors.
Furthermore, it appears that there has been in the ®rst half of 1997 a number
of ®nancial innovations to address the needs of early-stage entrepreneurs. These
include the creation of incubators and ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs
by established venture organizations such as May®eld and Mohr Davidow; innovative eorts to direct the resources of individual investors to small venture
capital funds (an example is Next Generation Partners, a ``fund-of-funds'' for
wealthy families developed by FLAG Venture Partners); and the increased willingness of institutional investors to provide capital to ®rst-time and seed venture funds. Thus, market forces may be addressing whatever problem did exist.
4. Conclusion
As the discussion above highlights, there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty about the need for public eorts to encourage investments in young

<-----Page 7----->780

®rms by individual investors. The ®nancial intermediaries specializing in funding young entrepreneurial ®rms, venture capitalists, have developed a variety of
mechanisms to address the information problems that young ®rms pose. While
the venture investors tend to concentrate investments in particular industries
and regions, and usually make substantial investments in the ®rms that they
support, it is unclear whether encouraging individuals to invest smaller
amounts in companies in other industries or areas would either generate positive ®nancial returns or improve social welfare.
Numerous ongoing policy debates materially impact small ®rms, particularly in high-technology industries. A few examples are the disputes regarding the
commercialization of federally funded research, the extent of patent and trade
secret protection, and the reform of the securities litigation process. It might
thus be questioned whether encouraging angel investors should be a public policy priority of the small business community.
This ®nal section, however, brie¯y considers the key challenges associated
with the design of programs to encourage individual investors. Because of
the relatively little research done on the topic of ``angel'' investors, this discussion is necessarily speculative in nature. Thus, I only seek to raise questions
about how these eorts should be designed and implemented.
· How to insure the involvement of value-added individual investors? Field studies ± see, for instance, Wetzel and Seymour (1981) and Freear et al. (1994) ±
have highlighted the heterogeneity of angel investors. Some are very sophisticated former entrepreneurs who may be of a great deal of assistance to the
new businesses that they ®nance; but other individual investors may be quite
naõve about the risks and delays associated with building an entrepreneurial
®rm. In fact, in some cases the involvement of unsophisticated individual investors can make it more dicult for an entrepreneurial ®rm to raise outside
capital (e.g., Das and Lerner, 1995). One challenge facing public eorts is
how to insure the involvement of angels who can add the most value.
· How to address concerns about disclosure and securities laws? In order to participate in ACE-Net, entrepreneurs need to ®le oering documents under
such securities provisions as Regulation A, Regulation D, or Rule 504, as
well as appropriate state ®lings. When private companies raise money informally through angel investors, they very rarely are required to undertake
such ®lings. Small privately held companies frequently resist disclosing ®nancial or business data, lest they provide their larger rivals with competitively useful information about their strategy and/or technology. It may be
important to consider whether public initiatives can be developed that do
not require such disclosures.
· How should public initiatives interact with similar private-sector eorts? An
Internet search reveals that a variety of for-pro®t entities have introduced
services which seek to match entrepreneurs with angel investors. Examples
include American Venture Capital Exchange, Capital Matchmaker, Fi-

<-----Page 8----->J. Lerner / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 773±783

781

nanceHub, MoneyHunter, and Venture Capital Report. Determining how
public and private eorts should interact will be an important policy priority.
Thus, important unanswered questions remain, both about the overall need
for and the desirable structure of public eorts to encourage angel investments
in entrepreneurial ®rms. One conclusion is certain: angel ®nance is a ripe area
for more intensive research, on both an empirical and theoretical level, by ®nancial economists. While data limitations have been a substantial barrier to
researchers in the past, through the careful examination of pioneering eorts
such as ACE-Net, we may gain a better understanding of these issues.
