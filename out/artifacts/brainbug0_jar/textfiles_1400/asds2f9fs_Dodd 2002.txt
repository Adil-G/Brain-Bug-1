Abstract
A grounded cultural model of US entrepreneurship is developed by analysing the metaphors that
entrepreneurs use to give meaning to entrepreneurship in their life-and-business narratives. The
resultant cultural model is coherent and internally consistent, and is helpful in providing stronger
insights into entrepreneurs’ own perspectives, aspirations, and cognition of the entrepreneurial process.
Close to Schumpeter’s conception of the entrepreneur, it nevertheless contains elements that are
markedly American, and can be contrasted both with European mental models of entrepreneurship,
and metaphorically derived models of organisational behaviour. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to develop a grounded cultural model of entrepreneurship in the
US. It is generally held that qualitative methodologies have most to offer in terms of theory
and model building, as opposed to theory-testing, and this convention has been observed in
the present study. Cultural models can be defined as:
presupposed, taken-for-granted models of the world that are widely shared by the members of
a society and that play an enormous role in their understanding of that world to their behavior
in it (Holland and Quinn, 1987, p. 4).

The question at issue here is therefore less definitional than cognitive, and highly relevant
to our comprehension of entrepreneurial identity, ontology, and teleology. Put more crudely,
who do entrepreneurs think they are, and what is the purpose of entrepreneurship in their
eyes? It is anticipated that if a pronouncedly North American model of entrepreneurship can
be uncovered, this will permit later transnational comparisons, allowing us to revisit from a
new perspective differences in entrepreneurial identity, motivation, societal prestige, and
some aspects of entrepreneurial cognition.
An increasing unease in sister disciplines about the overly nominalist, positivist, and
objectivist assumptions underlying the ontology, epistemology, and methodology of, e.g.,
organisational behaviour, has led to experimentation with a range of new approaches. One
relatively novel approach, which has received much attention, is the use of metaphor.1
Following upon an upsurge in interest in metaphor among cognitive scientists, linguists,
and philosophers (Ortony, 1979), Morgan (1980) found a useful way to describe the different
paradigms in organisational studies as stemming from four broad metaphors. Later use of
metaphor as a methodological tool has often focused on generating, extracting, or analysing
the meaning of various aspects of organisations. This may take the form of social scientists
searching for metaphors already in use within an organisation, or in the stimulation of
metaphor creation as a way of fostering a shift of perceptions within an organisation, thus
facilitating organisational change (Morgan, 1986). Indeed, the metaphor has been used so
widely to tackle so many research problems in so many different ways that it has sometimes
run the danger of outpacing the theoretical developments needed to underpin its usage.
(Appendix A lists some of the topics that have been tackled to date.) Morgan, in particular,
espouses a strong, almost (paradoxically) universalistic, theory of metaphor, maintaining that
it is ‘‘a primal means through which we forge our relationship with the world. . . Metaphor
has a formative impact on language, on the construction and embellishment of meaning, and
on the development of theory and knowledge of all kinds’’ (Morgan, 1997, p. 277).2

2. Meaning and metaphors
Although controversy continues to surround some of the more all-embracing claims made
on behalf of metaphors,3 a ‘‘weak constructivist argument’’ has achieved some degree of
general acceptance (McCourt, 1997). McCourt expresses this position cogently when he
notes that ‘‘we are on firm ground in assenting to Black’s contention that metaphor can
generate insight into how things are’’ (p. 513). Specifically, metaphors provide insights into

studying organisations, see Grant and Oswick (1996), Palmer and Dunford (1996), and McCourt (1997).
2
Among cognitive scientists, Lakoff and Johnson, and MacCormac in particular espouse a strong theory of the
role of metaphor in cognition: ‘‘our ordinary conceptual system, interims of which we both think and act, is
fundamentally metaphorical in nature’’ (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, p. 1; see also Lakoff, 1987; MacCormac,
1985, p. 1).

how their users, or coiners, perceive their own reality. Metaphors can ‘‘create realities, guide
future action, and reinforce experiential coherence’’ (Klagge, 1997, p. 76). Hill and
Levenhagen (1995) developed a framework to explain how they believe entrepreneurs
develop mental models to make sense of their experiences, perceptions, and plans, as well
as to communicate this sense to others. They argue cogently that:
Should an individual wish to enact her/his mental model, she/he will do so actively by a
language articulation phase. . . the first articulation in the language stream is typically a
metaphor (Hill and Levenhagen, 1995, p. 1062).

To investigate the understanding, which entrepreneurs create of the roles they adopt and
the processes they undertake, and thus to map a simple cultural model of entrepreneurship,
one useful approach would be to garner and analyse the metaphors — the rudimentary mental
models — for which they reach. Essentially, the claim being made is that metaphors offer a
key to the cognitive processes of the entrepreneur (Morgan, 1997, pp. 301–302).
Of the many disputes which still surround the use of metaphor in the study of organisations
and their actors, most are avoided within the context of entrepreneurship,4 particularly if, as
increasingly recommended, the metaphors of agents, rather than of researchers, are studied
(Dunford and Palmer, 1996). For example, one major area of contention is to what extent
metaphors emerge ‘‘innocently’’ within organisations, rather than being imposed by a
dominant group. This dilemma is redundant in the entrepreneurial context, precisely because
the entrepreneur is the main creator of meaning within their organisation, and we are
interested in the metaphor created by the dominant player, whether innocently or deliberately.
The problem then presents itself of how to access entrepreneurs’ metaphors. Some
researchers have experimented with techniques, which ask respondents specifically to
generate metaphors.5 Koiranen (1995) reports a questionnaire-based study into North
European metaphors of entrepreneurship, which resulted in six main categories of metaphor:
creativity/activeness, special characteristics and features, machine(ry) or physical objects,
nature, sports and games, adventurer, and warrior or battler (op. cit. p. 5). Pitt (1998)
developed quasi-narratives intersubjectively from longitudinal case studies. Among the
analytic techniques that he applied to the narratives thus derived was a study of the metaphors
used by the two entrepreneurs to make sense of the different roles they had adopted over the
years in question. For example, one of the entrepreneurs conceived of himself variously as a
commando, a poacher, a pioneer, and a prospector. In supporting his use of life stories, Pitt
argues that:
Individuals, especially innovative entrepreneurs, are often motivated to explain their
situations to a wider audience, literally to tell their stories. Appropriately contextualised, their
discourse engenders dramatic narratives that, as in a well-crafted novel, allows readers to gain
insights into their hearts, minds and motivations (Pitt, 1998, p. 387).

4

For a discussion of these disputes, see Dunford and Palmer (1996).
Morgan’s (1991) action research/action learning methodology is perhaps the best known example of this
approach (pp. 292 – 302).

The use of life stories of entrepreneurs and their businesses may, in fact, be a particularly
fertile ground for harvesting analyzable data. Cognitive scientists, searching for what defines
consciousness and meaning — creation — have suggested that it is in life stories that we
develop and present our understanding of the aspects of our existence, which have shaped our
entire mindset:
What does seem common and central to consciousness is the ability to carry on a monologue
or dialogue about oneself and others in the intentional idioms of a natural language, to be able
to give life narratives (Leiber, 1991, p. 151).6

Therefore, life narratives offer access to the most fundamental and important form of
human cognition — that of understanding our lives and ourselves. Metaphors constitute our
first attempts at creating mental models to make sense of our life narratives. Thus, a research
methodology, which examines the use of metaphors in the life narratives of entrepreneurs,
could be expected to yield results which ‘‘interest, inform, provoke’’ (Aldrich, 1992, p. 38).

3. Methodology
The present paper attempts to operationalise such a methodology by harvesting and
analysing metaphors used by (US) entrepreneurs to give meaning to their life-and-business
stories. The first stage in the process was collection of raw data — entrepreneurial life stories.
Secondary sources were scanned, and those which provided the richest seam of narratives
about the life and business creation of entrepreneurs proved to be the popular business press.7
The material was already in narrative format, which facilitated the methodology considerably,
since the intention of the pieces utilised was to tell the entrepreneurs’ stories. The use of
electronic versions of these publications permitted rapid search for ‘‘Entrepreneur: life
narratives,’’ and any article thus located was extracted. This stage of the review covered
the years 1996–1998 and about 100 articles were harvested.
Qualitative methods, including discourse analysis, typically focus on very small samples,
of even one or two pieces of text, and further screening was deemed necessary to prune the
raw material into manageable proportions. Those stories, which dealt primarily with a
particular aspect of entrepreneurship (marketing, finance, etc.), were discarded, and the
remaining 50 articles screened again to select those where the entrepreneur’s own words
were the main constituent of the piece, either through the extensive use of direct speech, or

6

Interestingly, one of the entrepreneurs in the cases studied seems to find valuable meaning in entrepreneurial
life stories: ‘‘I am fascinated by other people’s stories. When you grow as quickly as we did, you don’t get a
perspective on things until six months later. Reading about other people’s stories helps me understand my own
story. I can read the story of a company that has become successful and say, ‘God, these guys went through that
too,’ and I can say at least I know I wasn’t an idiot. I read the stories of people like the founders of Nike and I
laugh. A lot of this is not brain surgery, it’s survival’’ (p. 9).
7
Forbes, Nations Business, Success, and the Benlore website ‘‘The Entrepreneur’s Mind’’ were the main
sources, although some industry-specific magazines such as Restaurant Business were also reviewed.

<-----Page 4----->S.D. Dodd / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) 519–535

523

because the pieces were authored by entrepreneurs. A final screening discarded those
articles that contained no clear example of metaphorical speech in discussions of
entrepreneurship. This resulted in a usable sample of 24 articles, some presenting stories
from more than one entrepreneur.8 A list of the enterprises and entrepreneurs in the final
sample is presented in the bibliography, as well as short overview of their ventures. The
samples comprises mainly those ventures that have already achieved significant success,
although three of the firms in the sample are still in the later stages of pre-birth and trial
trading (cases 1, 6, 8). The popular business press, in general, is far more interested in the
route to success, however difficult this may have been, than in the unsuccessful
entrepreneur. Thus, one limitation of the present study is that the sample of entrepreneurs
studied is composed of higher achievers than would be anticipated in an otherwise derived
sample. They can thus be expected to ascribe to more idealised and positive meanings to
entrepreneurship than might be the case with a broader sample.
A further limitation of the approach was the intervention of the journalist in the
transcription process. Since the approach required access to a large number of life narratives,
primary data collection was not a feasible option. However, the rigour of the method, and the
strength of the results, are somewhat limited by the use of secondary data, since the narratives
have been interpreted and presented following journalistic conventions. One of the major
strengths of most qualitative research is that involvement of researchers in the data collection
process permits analysis of the setting and context within which such interactions occur, and
of the role of the researcher in the process itself. In the present study, such benefits did not
accrue, although the larger volume of secondary material that was harvested has brought its
own rewards, not least in terms of increased generalisability.
Attempts to minimise the impact of this limitation were made. For example, where a
journalist has intervened in the storytelling process, only direct quotations from the
entrepreneurs have been utilised as source material. In fact, the entrepreneur-authored texts,
and those which had been transcribed by journalists, showed no significant difference
whether in the number of metaphors utilised in each piece, nor in the choice of metaphor
vehicles. It is therefore asserted that the restriction of the textual analysis to direct speech has
been successful in reducing journalistic ‘‘spin’’ to as low a level as possible, although clearly
entrepreneur-authoring of life stories remains preferable. In this instance, post-hoc cognition
is a necessity, rather than a drawback:
For entrepreneurs and innovative organisations, only action followed by observation will
fully verify a novel cause and effect conceptualisation. . . Later verbal articulations can
provide a framework for developing shared understanding through retrospective sensemaking
(Hill and Levenhagen, 1995, p. 1067; see also Weick, 1979, 1985).

Whether the narratives are ‘‘true’’ in a conventional sense is less important than that ‘‘the
coherence provided by the narrative matches the coherence you see in your life. . . that gives it
meaning and significance’’ (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, p. 174).
8

An attempt to use article length as a screening criteria failed: some long pieces contained little or no
reflection on the meaning of entrepreneurship, and some shorter pieces contained nothing else.

Having collected the raw material, the next step in the methodological process was to
extract all metaphors from the narratives. In reality, this involved several, careful, word-byword readings of the texts, with metaphors cut-and-pasted to a separate file. Next, the
resultant collection of metaphors was reviewed, and a note was made of the vehicle and
object of each metaphor (e.g., Vehicle: dice-throwing; Object: risk-taking). This is standard
analysis in the study of metaphor. Results were collated both by vehicle and by object, in
tabular form, directly from these annotations. Then, next to each of the vehicles and objects
listed, a broader noun or concept was entered to begin the categorisation process. For
example, where the vehicle was dice-throwing, the broader noun might be game; where the
vehicle was child, the noun would be parenting. The completed process resulted in seven
broad concepts having been chosen to describe vehicles, which in turn provided seven vehicle
groups. The resultant groupings of vehicles were thus allowed to emerge as naturally as
possible, rather than being only researcher-imposed. Nonetheless, any analysis is subject to
the cultural preconceptions of the researcher in question, and this includes selection of
coherent categories, as Lakoff (1987) has argued cogently. It is hoped that sufficient cultural
similarities exist between the researcher and subjects for adequately representative
categorisation to have been carried out. However, it is certainly possible that some of the
groupings are the result of the researcher’s own mindset. Perhaps, the strongest claim that can
be made for these findings, then, is that they represent one possible model of US
entrepreneurship, viewed through the lens of British skepticism.

4. Findings
Among the objects which entrepreneurs frequently chose to describe in metaphorical terms
were idea generation and articulation, taking risks (especially by ‘‘breaking the mould’’), and
dealing with difficulties, particularly in terms of convincing others (funders, distributors,
suppliers, and customers) of the concept’s viability. The most frequently observed object,
however, was ‘‘entrepreneurship,’’ or ‘‘being an entrepreneur,’’ or ‘‘becoming an entrepreneur,’’ or ‘‘the whole process of starting a venture,’’ The results relating to stages in the
entrepreneurial process will be the focus of a later study, since our main intention here is an
analysis of entrepreneurship in a broad sense. The vehicles used by entrepreneurs to give
meaning to the entrepreneurial process, as well as some of the distinct stages within, were
grouped into seven metaphor families, as Table 1 shows.
It quickly became clear that many of the samples were reaching for the same or similar
metaphors when trying to structure the meaning entrepreneurship has for them. Most of these
vehicles are dynamic, focusing upon various kinds of disruptive and difficult human
activities. The exception is the vehicle which draws upon the construction of a building as

525

a model for understanding new business creation, where organisation and order are implied.
This is also the only mechanistic vehicle where entrepreneurship is compared to making a
THING of some kind. In the organisational behaviour literature, such metaphors are common,
with organisations frequently referred to as machines, buildings, etc. Entrepreneurship
vehicles emphasise process (verbs) rather than objects (nouns), and are often highly emotionally charged (parenting, passion, lunacy/iconoclasm). In order to shed further light upon
the mental model, which entrepreneurs create to give meaning to their lived experience, these
six vehicles will next be analysed individually.
4.1. Entrepreneurship as journey
Six of the entrepreneurs whose life stories were examined described the entrepreneurial
process as a journey of some kind (1, 4, 5, 6, 14, and 16). Goatly (1997) reports that one of
the most basic root analogies of the English language is that which describes the development/success in terms of movements forward:
If purposeful activity is movement in a direction, success is moving forward. . . to develop or
be more successful than others is to move ahead in a role. . . distance moved is a measure of
success. . . difficulty in succeeding is difficulty in moving forward. . . to solve a problem/
avoid failure is to pass over/through/around (Goatly 1997, p. 44).

The appropriateness of this vehicle for giving meaning to entrepreneurship is striking,
since it contains allusions to the process of business creation and its complexity, leading to
success once obstacles and problems have been overcome, as well as suggesting the
importance of entrepreneurship in creating meaning, faith, and purpose within the life of
the entrepreneur. Indeed, the metaphor is utilised by the sample in many of these ways, e.g.,
the need to take a step-by-step approach in the face of an equivocal future:
I look at this whole process as just steps. If you look too far down the road, you’ll just get
boggled. I look back at what has happened and my mind is just blown. I can’t believe the stuff
I’ve gone through and what we have accomplished even though we’re still not out of the
gates yet. . . You’ve got to take it one step at a time and stay focused (6).

Similarly, there are exhortations to ‘‘keep the compass out and keep going in the right
direction’’ since ‘‘you’re in uncharted territory (1)’’. Another entrepreneur emphasises the
importance of the process, and not simply the end or destination, of the journey: ‘‘It’s good to
have an end in mind and a journey towards, but in the end it’s the journey that matters’’ (6).
Finally, the journey metaphor is also used to put into context the difficulties faced by
entrepreneurs, with references to ‘‘bumps’’ (5), ‘‘how to get around the next roadblock’’ (14).
Of all the metaphors identified, the journey vehicle appears to be the most strongly
culturally conditioned. Overtones of the treks of the American pioneers are detectable in
places, e.g., particularly in terms of explaining the difficulties of the start-up process: ‘‘It’s a
real hard road. Some people are just not meant to carve a trail on their own’’ (1).
It seems likely that, as they give meaning to venture creation, American entrepreneurs are
drawing at least in part upon images of successful, brave, and arduous venturing drawn from

<-----Page 7----->526

S.D. Dodd / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) 519–535

their shared history The journey metaphor contains strong echoes of the original voyages to
America, as well as the later ventures into its interior. De Pillis argues cogently that:
Americans admire entrepreneurs for the individual expression and freedom of choice that they
embody. . . It is interesting to note that business venturing, something imbedded in the
American experience from the time of the Pilgrims or perhaps even Columbus, is perceived by
Americans as an almost spontaneous expression of individual freedom (De Pillis, 1998, p. 6).

It is therefore possible that the regular use of a metaphor, which likens venturing to
journeying, is largely culturally determined, and reflects specifically North American
iconography of the venturer–entrepreneur. Although comparative studies are required to
verify this assertion, it is likely that entrepreneurs finding meaning within this metaphor are
probably influenced by this ideal type. Of course, many cultures exhibit some shared
mythology of the journey, such as the Exodus story in Judaism, but the content of these
stories varies from one society to another.

4.2. Entrepreneurship as a race
The metaphor of a race is also used, with entrepreneurs entering the arena (2), leaving the
starting gates (8, 19), establishing a record-setting pace (4), taking a series of hurdles (6), and
subsequently establishing a proven track record (2). Again, the root analogy of movements
forward as development/success is being called upon. However, the race vehicle carries
stronger connotations of competition, as well as taking part in a public event where failure, as
well as success, carry social consequences. Here, the concept of success seems stripped of its
crude financial meaning. Although (increasingly) top athletes become very rich, their glory
lies in their achievements on the track, in the medals, and the recognition their efforts have
won them. Success in achieving their goals is its own reward.

4.3. Entrepreneurship as building
Metaphors which draw upon the concept of building a building are also to be found,
although they are few in number, with only three mentions. Again, the emphasis is upon the
activity of laying foundations (2), building (16), getting in on the ground floor (7). The major
point here appears to be the need to take time and care over the pre-trading stages of business
creation. As noted above, this is the only example of a physical object being chosen to
symbolise the enterprise, rather than an activity (race, journey, war, iconoclasm) or a child

<-----Page 8----->S.D. Dodd / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) 519–535

527

(parenting). There is very little evidence from the material studied, therefore, to suggest that
entrepreneurs choose to give meaning to their experiences in terms of the mechanistic
metaphor so beloved of organisational studies.

4.4. Entrepreneurship as parenting
It is common for metaphors to take a form where ‘‘abstract entities are represented not
simply as concrete, but as animate and human’’ (Goatly, 1997, p. 51). The major example of
such anthropomorphism in our study was the vehicle which compared entrepreneurship to
parenting. As with the journey vehicle, parenting was able to sustain extended analogies. The
enterprise was conceived of as a child who must be born, and helped to grow through its early
difficult years. Founders ‘‘share in the birth’’ (4) of the new firm, and ideas, industries, and
enterprises are much more usually born than just started (5, 7, 18, 14). One venture lawyer is
described as having ‘‘served as midwife for hundreds of new companies (18). Birth
encapsulates well the process of creating an enterprise by highlighting the joy, pain, hard
work, and long gestation period involved, as well as emphasizing that the entrepreneur will be
responsible for this new creation as it grows and develops for a long time to come. The love
of a parent for their child is also apparent, especially when one entrepreneur speaks of the
business he has sold but still yearns for: ‘‘That chain will always be my baby’’ (18).
The metaphor of raising a child is sometimes extended to account for the difficulties of
growth, and especially the tentative, stumbling nature of early development, with mention
being made of ‘‘growing pains’’ (4), and subsequent reaching of maturity (4). Similarly, ‘‘we
still are an entrepreneurial company that is slowly evolving out of ‘toddlerhood’’’ (3).
Another entrepreneur applies the child-raising metaphor to the specific business context
within which he operates:
Running a site is like taking care of kids. It’s round-the-clock, with intensive spurts, then long
periods of not much happening (10).

The major implications of this analogy are the joy and difficulties of creating a new
venture/child, and nurturing its growth, as well as the complexity and length of the process. It
is possible that there is also here the implication that these ventures are being prepared for
eventual independence, a life separate from the entrepreneur upon reaching maturity.
Again, the differences with mainstream management literature are noteworthy. Although
organisational ecologists have taken an interest in age dependency (infancy, adolescence, and
obsolescence), their approach to firm birth and growth involves a Darwinian metaphor of
evolution, selection, and survival rates among populations of firms (see Henderson, 1999, pp.
281–283 for a review of this literature). This macro, quasi-scientific perspective is quite
different from the intensely personal, deeply involved, and highly individual perspective of
the entrepreneur as parent/father. It should also be recalled that the choice of paternalism, or

<-----Page 9----->528

even patriarchy, as an interpretative and legitimate model may not always be interpreted in a
positive light.

4.5. Entrepreneurship as war
Four entrepreneurs used analogies that draw upon military, warlike terms. Aggressive
claims are made when competition is discussed: ‘‘we’re taking our competitors to the
cleaners’’ (3), for example, and ‘‘we’re kicking butt’’ (18). The notion of shooting for a target
is also to be found, as in ‘‘never take your eye off the target when you’ve hit the big one (3)’’,
or ‘‘he knew. . . what sort of terms we should be shooting for’’ (19). Claims are made that
‘‘we like to be in the trenches’’ (19), and one entrepreneur conceives of his start-up marketing
strategy in terms of an invasion:
Creating a company is very much like a storming a beach in a war. In order to get a foothold
in a marketplace, you have to have a beachhead. . . then, once we were established, we
strengthened our flanks and spread out (22).

Each time an aggressive metaphor was utilised, the aggression was directed outside the
business, and not upon the child venture the entrepreneur has created. Dunford and Palmer
(1996, p. 103), argue, however, that the use of such language, wherever it is directed,
reinforces male experiences and patriarchal power relations. In our study, patriarchy has
already been noted as a possible component of entrepreneur’s models of their own activities
(fatherhood), and indeed two of the warrior–entrepreneurs also use parenting metaphors
when discussing entrepreneurship.

4.6. Entrepreneurship as iconoclasm
There is a strong sense of the entrepreneur as iconoclast, shattering the mold (4), ‘‘wreaking
havoc’’ (12), ‘‘going against conventional wisdom’’ (13), being a ‘‘renegade’’ (18), changing
the rules of the game, etc.; thus, ‘‘I believe that entrepreneurs like to be the oddball, that they
want to be the grain of sand that irritates the oyster to make the pearl’’ (12). Another
entrepreneur spoke of the need for ‘‘this crazy unsubstantiated faith that this is going to
happen’’ (6), and many noted with humour that family and former colleagues considered them
‘‘nuts’’ (3, 5, 6, 14, 19).

4.7. Entrepreneurship as passion
The most predominant metaphor that expressed the relationship between the entrepreneurs and their businesses was one of romance (7), love, and passion. Entrepreneurs fall in
love with the product/concept (7), to the extent that they describe it as a ‘‘passion’’ (8, 15, 19,
23). And if this commitment leads to success, then the emotion is overwhelming: ‘‘It’s like
the greatest dream you could ever have, wanting something as a kid like a toy that appeared in
your head and in the morning you woke up and it was there’’ (3). This fierce attachment to the
business has already been posited in the parenting metaphor, but is underlined by the passion
which the entrepreneurs claim to feel for what they are doing (either that or they have just
been reading too much Tom Peters).

4.8. A tentative grounded cultural model of us entrepreneurship
Table 2 collates the overviews of the grounds identified in each of the metaphor families.
The table makes clear the overlap between the grounds of the vehicles chosen to represent
aspects of entrepreneurship. ‘‘Journey,’’ for example, contains common grounds with
‘‘building,’’ ‘‘parenting,’’ and ‘‘race,’’ All the vehicles (with the exception of ‘‘building’’)
share common grounds with (at least) two other vehicles. By redrawing Table 2 in
diagrammatic form, it is possible to illustrate these shared grounds, which link the seven
vehicles together. Indeed, the diagram, shown in Fig. 1, represents a unified — if tentative —
cultural model that is internally consistent and well articulated.
The model illustrates well the meaning of entrepreneurship from the (US) entrepreneur’s
perspective. Metaphors function by highlighting certain aspects of a situation or process, and
by hiding other areas. In understanding the cognitive processes of entrepreneurs, it is helpful

to focus on what they highlight, what they consider to lie at the heart of the entrepreneurial
process, but also on what they hide, overlook, or ignore.
In terms of highlighted aspects of the entrepreneurial process, the seven main vehicle
images, which compose our model, were encountered frequently enough for it to be argued
that these represent basic or conventional metaphors that have entered common conceptual
usage. They have become, for US entrepreneurs, ‘‘metaphors that structure the ordinary
conceptual system of our culture, which is reflected in our everyday language’’ (Lakoff and
Johnson, 1980, p. 139).
The key meaning expressed in these conventional metaphors is that the entrepreneurial
process is a multi-faceted, even paradoxical, process. The passion and joy of entrepreneurship is contrasted with the pain and the struggle. The need for radical and dynamic
mouldbreaking is contrasted with the daily grind of this long-term and arduous undertaking.

The process is beset by problems, and determination is needed if the entrepreneur is to
succeed in changing the market place in which they operate, in the face of ridicule from
those around them. Importantly, the metaphors are dynamic in nature, emphasizing the
constant drive forward, the excitement of the process, and its creative nature. In many of
the metaphors, it is the process which generates the excitement, as much as the nascent
business. There is no hint of the more static mechanistic metaphors, nor of the negativity of
metaphors of the organisation as a psychic prison, for example. We are presented with a
paradox of entrepreneurs finding both considerable pain and considerable pleasure within
the entrepreneurial process. (Readers who are parents will recognise here the resonance of
the childbearing and rearing metaphor).
Which aspects of business creation are hidden, or understated, in the cognitive framework
that has been uncovered? Although one of the functions of entrepreneurship, at a macrolevel,
has long been recognised to be creative destruction, it is possible to overstate the need to
completely rebuild, to utterly shatter the mold, with each new business idea. A more
incremental approach to new product development, or new business development, is
appropriate in some instances, but is utterly absent from the (literally and metaphorically
articulated) mindsets of the entrepreneurs in this sample. Similarly, by highlighting that those
around them had serious doubts about their sanity, something which obviously amused the
entrepreneurs, the sample group underplayed the supportive role of their domestic environment, potentially a considerable resource for emotional succour. Love, it is said, is blind: it
can certainly be shortsighted. Excessive passion is indubitably one source of the commitment,
determination, and dedication needed to successfully create a new venture. Yet, carried to
extremes, it can restrict the abilities of the entrepreneur to perceive realistically and
objectively the object of his passion. Finally, much of the sensemaking in which entrepreneurs engaged was essentially introspective in nature. External agents were only discussed in
terms of the difficulties of setting up strategic partnering arrangements. The customers and the
competition received scant attention. Exceptions are the metaphors of war, races, and games
(which all have connotations, at least, of competition, winners, and losers, etc.), and of
moving dramatically away from the established practice of existing firms (presumably the
competition, although this is never made clear). Of these, only the war metaphor directly
addresses competitive strategy, which is a disturbing finding given the exposure of new
ventures to competitive pressures.

5. Conclusions
Four major conclusions can be derived from the foregoing analysis.
(1) The qualitative methodology followed in this study has allowed us to generate a fairly
well-specified grounded cultural model of (US) entrepreneurship. The multi-faceted model
highlights the pain and pleasure, the nurturing and aggression, the painstaking care and
innovation, the length of time, the commitment and the struggles involved in entrepreneurship.
(2) Entrepreneurs create a different model of their activities than those which are
typically used to analyse and describe organisations. This is not a surprising finding,

<-----Page 13----->532

especially given that most of the metaphors popular in organisational studies, for example,
are researcher-created, rather than grounded. By comparison with the machines, evolving
organisms, and psychic prisons of organisational behaviour, entrepreneurs’ cognitive models
concentrate far more on the process of creation, its joys and tribulations, and on their
personal role in this undertaking.
The shared model we have uncovered is disruptive, and the key agent in it is the entrepreneur,
not the business. This is in sharp contrast to the organisational analogies, where the role of the
manager is in maintenance and supervision of an existing system, rather than creation of a new
one. This finding provides support for recent claims that it is in cognition that we may expect to
find differences between entrepreneurs and managers (see, e.g., Barron, 1997).
(4) The aim of this study was simply to attempt to build a cultural model of entrepreneurship
from the entrepreneur’s perspective. Comparing this model to some or all of those that have
been generated by researchers is a separate and distinct task. However, the entrepreneurs’
model reveals considerable proximity to Schumpeter’s writings. Specifically, Schumpeter’s
(1934) discussion of entrepreneurial motivation, in ‘‘The theory of economic development’’
cites ‘‘the joy of creating,’’ ‘‘the dream and the will to found a private kingdom,’’ and ‘‘the will
to conquer. . . for the sake not of the fruits of success, but of success itself’’ (pp. 91–93). Our
deconstruction of the metaphors drawing on images of the race, the act of parenting, of
passion, and iconoclasm produced almost identical results. in particular, the iconoclasm/lunacy
vehicle of our model finds strong parallels in Schumpeter’s theories of creative destruction.9
(4) Entrepreneurs from the US share some common points with their North European
counterparts in their cognition of what entrepreneurship is, and the use of metaphors from
both samples, which emphasise creativity and action or which draw upon sporting and
military metaphors, illustrates this point (Koiranen, 1995, p. 5). However, cultural differences
are also observable, in that no evidence for the use of ‘‘Nature’’ metaphors, nor machine/
physical object metaphors could be found within the American texts studied. The different
methodologies of the two studies unfortunately preclude more detailed or direct comparison,
although even these limited findings suggest that transnational differences may be accessed
through the study of metaphor and creation of cultural models of entrepreneurship. Future
research comparing similarly derived cultural models from other societies may add to our
understanding of transnational differences, if the problem of language can be overcome.
In conclusion, the metaphors presented by entrepreneurs are colourful, packed with
insights, and stimulating. ‘‘Metaphors contain emotive content and are likely to evoke an
emotional response’’ (Hill and Levenhagen, 1995, p. 1064). Unlike literal truths, they require
reflection, unpacking. For both of these reasons, they are likely to prove a useful addition to
our didactic armoury, facilitating students’ grasp of what it feels like to be an entrepreneur. As
Chia (1996) suggests, giving freer rein to the imagination is a creative exercise. Perhaps,
through such non-traditional approaches, it is easier to recapture the passion for research, for
understanding, and for problem solving, which is the ultimate reward of our profession, and
9

Although primarily interested in large-scale clusters of entrepreneurs together pulling down whole edifices
within capitalism, Schumpeter (1934) concedes that any entrepreneurial act, even ‘‘making a success of a
particular kind of sausage or toothpaste,’’ involves creative destruction (p. 132).

owe him thanks.
