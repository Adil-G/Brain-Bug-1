Introduction
Why trust? The question evokes varied interpretations
and assorted responses. From questions about the essence
of human nature to debates about the problem of order in
society to queries about the dynamics of virtually all
forms of interpersonalrelationships, trusthas long figured
prominently in scholarly and lay discourse alike. However, only recently have organizational researchers devoted considerable attention to understanding the significance of trust for the organization and coordination of
economic activities. The relatively recent interest in trust
for organizational studies invites a slightly different take
on the question "Why trust?" Specifically, why has the
concept of trust become important for theories about organizations, and why now? In part, the trend is a response
to the overly atomistic assumptions of some economic
theories that strip organizations of their inherent social
qualities (Granovetter 1985). In part, the interest has been
prompted by emerging competitive dynamics that make
collaboration an attractive source of competitive advantage, and in some cases a strategic imperative. And, the
trend is fueled in part by changes in technology that have
reconfigured exchange and the coordination of work
across distance and time.
What these seemingly unrelated trends have in common is that they challenge organizational researchers to
understand the functioning and evolution of new organizational forms such as strategic alliances, distributed
groups, electronic commerce, and knowledge-intensive
organizations. A distinguishing feature of these new organizational forms is that they alter the patterns of interdependencies and the nature and extent of uncertainty.
The consequence being that the individuals working in
the new organizational forms become more dependent on,
and more vulnerable to, the decisions and actions of others-both preconditions and concomitants of trust.

To date, the organizational literature has made some
important advances in our understandingof the meaning
of trust and how it relates to certain facets of organizations. Apart from the increasing number of journal articles, there have also been several special issues (see, for
example, the 1998 Academy of Management Review special issue, guest edited by Rousseau et al. and the 2001
Organization Studies special issue, guest edited by
Bachmann et al.) and books (e.g., Gambetta 1988,
Kramer and Tyler 1996, Lane and Bachmann 1998) devoted to the topic of trust in and between organizations.
The recent proliferation of research on trust provokes yet
anothertake on the "why trust?"question, which is: Why
publish a special issue of Organization Science on trust
in an organizational context?
We were motivated to propose this special issue by
several observations we had made about the way the organizational trust literaturehas evolved. In particular,we
noted that while there has been considerable theoretical
progress, the literaturecontained little empirical evidence
to substantiate the multiple theories that have emerged.
To build on the advances made thus far and move towards
a cumulative body of knowledge, we believe that theories
about trust in an organizational context should be complemented by empirical research. The papers that appear
in this special issue make an important contribution toward reducing this gap.
January 2001 marked the deadline for submissions for
this special issue. The enthusiastic response was evident
in the 77 submissions that we received. Of these, 65 appeared consistent with the broad theme of the special issue and were sent out for review. Based on the initial
round of reviews, we invited 16 papers to be revised. We
also invited the authors of these papers to a special issue
conference at Lake Como, Italy, sponsored by the Organization and HRM Department of SDA, Bocconi University School of Management. The conference provided

the authors with an opportunity to meet, share their research with each other, and obtain feedback for further
revising their papers. Each paper was then reviewed a
second time and, based on these reviews, we determined
that seven had been able to successfully satisfy the reviewers and were suitable for publication.
As a set, the seven papers selected for publication represent a wide range of methodological approaches (i.e.,
from laboratory experiments to a single-firm field study
to cross-industry and cross-national field studies), a diverse set of theoretical disciplines (e.g., social psychology, sociology, economics), a variety of levels of analysis
(individual, group, organizational, and interorganizational), and a blend of empirical models (trust as an antecedent, outcome, and moderator). We now briefly introduce the seven papers and the unique insights each
provides into the role of trustin an organizationalcontext.
We then introduce our own contribution to the special
issue.

of an organization on trust is contingent on communication frequency. The authors argue that as the frequency
of communication increases, emphasis shifts from the
trustor's to the trustee's individual and contextual characteristics. Data on the relationship among senior managers of a multinational corporation are used to test the
hypotheses. The findings point to a view of trust production in organizations that consists of individual, dyadic,
and contextual components.

Stewart
In this intriguing paper, Stewart addresses a fundamental
question: How do we decide to trust an unknown entity
when encountering it for the first time? The paper develops a theory of "trust transfer,"which is construed as a
cognitive process. The paper posits that we form impressions about the trustworthiness of an unknown target
based on its association with a source with which we have
greater knowledge. Using an experimental design that
simulates organizations doing business on the World
Wide Web, the study shows that relational and contextual
conditions affect the transferabilityof trust.
Ferrin and Dirks
The authors of this paper query the significance of rewards and incentives-a central feature of organizational
context-for trust formation. The paper asserts that several attributional processes mediate the relationship between reward structure and interpersonal trust. To test
their predictions, Ferrin and Dirks devise a clever laboratory experiment that combines different reward structures with different initial trust conditions. Their findings
suggest that rewards not only shape behaviors, but also
exert a powerful effect on perceptions that influence trust.
Given the accessibility of rewards to managerial discretion, the paper raises interesting questions about the malleability of trust.
Becerra and Gupta
In a similar vein, Becerra and Gupta also probe the influence of organizational context on trust. However, the emphasis here is on how the influence of the social structure
2

Carson, Madhok, Varman, and John
Carson and his colleagues also focus on the outcomes of
organizational and structuralcharacteristics,but consider
their effects on the efficacy of trust-based governance.
Using the assumption of bounded rationality as a point of
departure,the authors explore how superior information
processing capabilities of firms enhance the positive effects of trust on performance. The underlying reasoning
is that organizations that are able to more accurately assess partner behavior, through superior task knowledge
for example, are better able to evaluate partnertrustworthiness and, therefore, employ trust more profitably. Using data from a sample of firms and their subcontracted
R&D projects they find the predicted moderating effects.
Dyer and Chu
Like Carson et al., Dyer and Chu study the effects of trust
in an interorganizational setting. However, Dyer and
Chu's concern is establishing whether the purported
benefits of trustmanifest themselves in the buyer-supplier
setting of the auto industry from three countries-the
United States, Japan and Korea. Using creative measures
of transaction costs (such as the time spent in renegotiation) they indeed find that trusted automakers incur substantially fewer procurement costs and are more privy to
information from suppliers. The authorsalso disaggregate
their findings for the three-country subsamples and uncover some nonintuitive differences between them.
Child and Mollering
The internationaltheme that surfaced in the Dyer and Chu
paper is the central focus of the paper by Child and Mollering who examine the creation and the effects of trust in
the Chinese business context. The authors suggest in effect that foreigners' trust in Chinese managers is a function of the trustworthinessof Chinese institutions. In addition to this source of trust, the authors also posit a role
for "active trust development." The questionnaire-based
results are generally consistent with the predictions.
Huff and Kelley
Tackling the issue of the internationalcultural context of
trust head on, Huff and Kelley contrast the levels of organizational trust across collectivist and individualistic

societies. The authors argue that people tend to trust
members of their own organizations more than those outside the organization and that this effect is greater in collectivist than in individualist societies. They also argue
that trust on average is lower for people from collectivist
societies, a prediction that runs counter to conventional
wisdom. Using data from a large sample, the authorsgenerally find support for their hypotheses.

so generously of their time. We were truly impressed with
the conscientiousness and timeliness of their reviews.

McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer
In the final paper of the special issue, we contemplate the
significance of trust research for the organizational literature more broadly. Currently,trustresearch is somewhat
fragmented and lacks coherence. We propose that conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle provides a
powerful means of integrating the literature and synthesizing a set of generalizable propositions about the effects
of trust on organizing. The paper details a set of causal
pathways that link trust to a number of key properties of
organizations. We conclude with observations about the
pressing issues and challenges that lie ahead for research
on trust in an organizational context.
We are pleased to bring you this special issue, and we
hope that you find the papers included in it as interesting
and insightful as the reviewers and we did. We applaud
the authors of these papers for their dedication and hard
work. We would also like to recognize the contributions
of several other individuals that made invaluable contributions and helped us make this special issue a reality.
We are grateful to Organization Science Editor-in-Chief
Kaye Schoonhoven for recognizing and encouraging us
to pursue the idea of a special issue on trust. We are most
appreciative of her enthusiasm and the support and guidance that she provided throughout this long and arduous
process! We also owe a special debt of gratitude to Dean
Ilker Baybars of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University, who provided funding to underwritethe expense of administering
the special issue. Our administrative assistants Rosanne
Christy and Bonnie Schultz had the unenviable task of
processing a mountain of manuscripts, reviews, and letters in a concentrated period of time. Without their diligence, devotion, and good humor the completion of the
special issue would have been far more difficult. We are
also grateful to the Organization and HRM Department
of SDA, Bocconi University School of Management for
sponsoring the conference associated with the special issue. BarbaraImperatoriis also to be commended for doing a superb job of coordinating the local arrangements
for the conference.
Finally, we wish to extend a heart-felt thank you to the
following 129 reviewers for the special issue who gave
