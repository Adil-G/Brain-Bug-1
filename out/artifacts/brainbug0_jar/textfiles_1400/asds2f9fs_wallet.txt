Easy on the mind, easy on the wallet:
The roles of familiarity and processing
fluency in valuation judgments
Adam L. Alter and Daniel M. Oppenheimer
Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey

Although people routinely estimate the value of items in their environment, from goods and services to
natural resources and lost earnings following an accident, the processes that underlie human valuation estimates
are not well understood. We show that people use familiarity and fluency—the ease with which they process
information—to determine an item’s value. In three experiments, participants believed that familiar forms of
currency (e.g., a familiar $1 bill) had greater purchasing power than their unfamiliar counterparts (e.g., a rare
and unfamiliar coin). Mechanistic analyses showed a positive correlation between participants’ familiarity with
the unfamiliar currency and their estimates of its value. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical
implications of our findings for researchers, marketing experts, and policymakers alike.

Valuation estimates govern both routine decisions, such
as whether to buy and sell goods and services, and larger
decisions, such as whether to attend college and which
vocation to pursue. Although valuation is a fundamental
component of human judgment, our understanding of the
principles that determine how people actually appraise a
target’s value is incomplete.
Financial and economic models explain the steps involved
in monetary valuation, but many assume that human valuers
are consistently rational. For example, the efficient market
hypothesis (Fama, 1965) assumes that investors reevaluate
market prices instantly and rationally when exposed to new
information; thus, a single investor cannot systematically
outperform the market in the short term. This definition assumes that informed investors are perfectly rational agents,
immune from subjective or suboptimal behavior.
In fact, many human valuation judgments tend to be
biased (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The endowment effect is one particularly well-cited example, according to
which people perceive greater value in goods that they
wish to sell than in identical goods they are attempting
to buy (Thaler, 1980). Other researchers have also shown
that sellers, buyers, and disinterested third parties adopt
very different approaches to valuation tasks because they
weight the same information quite differently (e.g., Birnbaum & Zimmermann, 1998).
Like buyers and sellers, people who interact with newly
introduced or foreign currency exhibit a series of systematic valuation biases. For example, despite understanding
the relevance of exchange rates, travelers tend to spend according to the face value of foreign currencies rather than
their value in real terms (Raghubir & Srivastava, 2002).

The introduction of the euro in 2002 and the deletion of
six zeroes from the Turkish lira in 2005 created similar
valuation anomalies among Europeans across several
countries (Cannon & Cipriani, 2006).
Other researchers have considered a range of specific
valuation biases (for a review, see Raghubir, 2006). For
example, people are more reluctant to spend a $100 bill
than to spend an equal amount with a gift certificate purchase (Raghubir & Srivastava, in press), a credit card purchase (Prelec & Simester, 2001), or successive purchases
using smaller denominations that sum to $100 (Mishra,
Mishra, & Nayakankuppam, 2006). These studies suggest
that people struggle to objectively valuate currency and
consumables in the face of numerous cognitive biases.
Many attempts at valuation are similarly plagued by the
subjectivity produced by valuation contexts. For example,
judges and juries attempt to translate a plaintiff’s pain into
the language of monetary value when assigning damages
in a negligence suit (Sunstein, Hastie, Payne, Schkade, &
Viscusi, 2002). Likewise, national governments periodically weigh the costs of deforestation against the benefits
of a new highway, or they question whether the threat of
global warming warrants costly power plant upgrades
(Hanemann, 1994).
Such subjective judgments are laced with uncertainty, and
humans tend to respond to uncertainty by adopting a variety
of judgmental heuristics (see, e.g., Tversky & Kahne­man,
1974). These heuristics, or cognitive shortcuts, simplify the
valuation process, but they also introduce a range of suboptimal cognitive biases. For example, the U.S. government
spends millions of dollars filtering arsenic from drinking
water, while ignoring other hazards that appear less harm-

ful but actually kill many more people (Sunstein, 2002).
Governments regularly allocate resources according to how
much fear a toxin engenders, rather than according to how
many people it affects in reality, which often results in the
dramatic misallocation of funds (Slovic, 2000).
Familiarity and Valuation
According to the mere exposure effect (Zajonc, 1968),
familiar items are preferred to their unfamiliar, but otherwise identical, counterparts. Since familiarity generates
the experience of liking, one might expect a familiar and
therefore more likable item to also seem more valuable.
One explanation for this effect is that familiar items become
increasingly appealing because they become more fluently
or easily processed (see, e.g., Fang, Singh, & Ahluwalia,
2007). Indeed, using items of varying degrees of familiarity is one of many techniques that researchers have used to
manipulate processing fluency (e.g., Alter & Oppenheimer,
2008a, 2008b; Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, & Eyre, 2007).
Although few studies have directly considered the role of
familiarity in valuation processes, one recent article examined whether the ease or fluency of pronouncing a stock’s
name influenced its performance immediately following its
initial public offering (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2006). Stock
performance data from the New York and American Stock
Exchanges between 1990 and 2004 showed that fluently
named stocks outperformed disfluently named stocks. Arguing for a similar mechanism, Mishra et al. (2006) noted
that people are more reluctant to spend notes of larger denominations (e.g., a $50 bill) than to use several smaller
notes with an equivalent value (e.g., five $10 bills), in part
because a $50 bill is more easily quantified.
For the present article, we examined the relationship
between familiarity and valuation directly and sought to
show that unfamiliar forms of currency seem less valuable
than their more familiar, but otherwise identical, counterparts (Experiments 1–3). We manipulated the familiarity
of the currency in our experiments by presenting either
more common or less common forms of currency in Experiments 1 and 2, and either real or subtly altered versions of real currency in Experiment 3.
We expected that familiarity might influence valuation judgments through different routes. Unfamiliar vi-

sual stimuli tend to be more difficult to process visually
(e.g.,Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001), and less familiar
stimuli are more difficult to remember (e.g., Tversky &
Kahneman, 1973). Both perceptual difficulty and unfamiliarity are forms of processing disfluency that tend
to engender disliking. Moreover, participants may more
readily recall using the familiar forms of currency, thereby
associating them with greater value than that of their unfamiliar counterparts. Regardless of which cognitive route
engendered disfluency, we expected that unfamiliar currency instruments would seem less valuable than their
more familiar counterparts.
Experiment 1
Method

Participants. Thirty-seven university staff and graduate students
were recruited from a dining hall at Princeton University.
Design, Materials, and Procedure. Participants completed a
one-page questionnaire in which they estimated how many of each
of 10 inexpensive items they could purchase with $1 (items listed
in Table 1).
Participants completed either a familiar-currency version or an
unfamiliar-­currency version of the questionnaire. The familiar­currency questionnaire contained a picture of a standard $1 bill,
whereas the unfamiliar-currency questionnaire contained a picture
of a Susan B. Anthony $1 coin (forms of currency from Experiments 1–3 are depicted in Figure 1). Produced in limited quantities from 1979 to 1981 and in 1999, Susan B. Anthony coins are
considerably rarer than $1 bills, which constitute 45% of all notes
produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (Bureau of Engraving and Printing, 2008). Accordingly, although both forms of
currency are equally valuable, we expected that participants would
be more familiar with the $1 bill and therefore would value the $1
bill more highly.
At the end of the questionnaire, participants reported their familiarity with the form of currency depicted at the top of the page,
using a scale ranging from 1 (never seen before) to 7 (seen more
than 50 times).

Results and Discussion
Manipulation check. As we expected, participants
were significantly more familiar with the $1 bill (M 5
7.00, SD 5 0.00) than they were with the $1 Susan B.
Anthony coin (M 5 4.18, SD 5 2.24) [t(35) 5 5.13, p ,
.001, η 2p 5 .43].

Figure 1. Familiar and unfamiliar forms of currency used in Experiments 1–3.

Primary analyses. We began by converting participants’ purchasing power estimates to standardized z scores,
a process that we also adopted in Experiments 2 and 3. This
allowed us to compare the estimates of the relatively more
expensive and less expensive items on a single scale. For
example, participants believed that they could purchase approximately eight pencils with $1, whereas they believed
they could purchase 64 paper napkins with the same $1.
As we predicted, participants in the familiar-currency
condition believed that they could purchase more of each
item, on average, with $1 than did participants in the
unfamiliar-­currency condition [t(9)  5 2.24, p  5 .015,
η 2p 5 .54]. (Figure 2 contains a graphical depiction of the
results, pooled across experiments, and Table 1 contains
the itemwise means from each experiment.) In support of a
familiarity mechanism, furthermore, the more familiar the
participants in the unfamiliar-currency condition were with
the Susan B. Anthony coin, the greater their estimates of its
purchasing power [r(19) 5 .43, p , .05]. Thus, participants
believed that the monetary sum of $1 had greater purchasing power when it was depicted in a familiar format.1
Experiment 1 provided preliminary evidence that unfamiliar forms of currency seem less valuable than their
more familiar counterparts. An alternative explanation,
however, is that coins seem inherently less valuable than
bills, regardless of their relative familiarity (see, e.g.,
Mishra et al., 2006). This account cannot explain why participants who were more familiar with the Susan B. Anthony dollar valued it more highly. Even when we confined
our analysis to participants in the coin condition, familiarity reliably influenced valuation judgments. Nonetheless,
in Experiment 2 we addressed this concern by avoiding
coins altogether. Instead, we presented participants in the
familiar-currency condition with two regular $1 bills, and
we presented those in the unfamiliar-currency condition
with one $2 bill, a comparatively rarer note.
Experiment 2
Method

Participants. The experimenter recruited 39 adult volunteers at
a Princeton University campus dining hall.

Design, Materials, and Procedure. The questionnaire in this experiment was similar to the questionnaire used in Experiment 1, with
several exceptions. First, participants estimated the quantity of each
item that they could purchase with $2. Second, the familiar-­currency
questionnaire depicted two $1 bills, whereas the unfamiliar-­currency
questionnaire depicted one $2 bill. Since there are 1,520 $1 bills
for every $2 bill in circulation (Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
2008), we expected that participants would be more familiar with the
$1 bill than with the $2 bill. At the end of the questionnaire, participants indicated their familiarity with the pictured form of currency
on a 7-point scale.

Results and Discussion
Manipulation check. As we expected, participants
were more familiar with the $1 bill (M 5 6.90, SD 5 0.31)
than with the $2 bill (M 5 3.21, SD 5 2.04) [t(37) 5 7.99,
p , .001, η 2p 5 .63].
Primary analyses. Participants in the familiar-­currency
condition believed that they could purchase more of each
item, on average, with $2 than did participants in the
unfamiliar-­currency condition [t(9) 5 4.23, p 5 .002, η 2p 5
.67] (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Further supporting the proposed familiarity mechanism, participants in the unfamiliar­currency condition who were more familiar with the $2 bill
believed that it had greater purchasing power than did those
who were less familiar with it [r(17) 5 .54, p 5 .02]. Experiment 2 therefore replicated the results of Experiment 1,
showing that participants perceived a more familiar form of
currency to have greater purchasing power than that of its
relatively unfamiliar counterpart.
In Experiment 3, we addressed two remaining concerns.
First, participants in the familiar-currency condition may
have perceived greater purchasing power merely because
there were two bills in that condition and only one bill
in the unfamiliar-currency condition. This alternative explanation contradicts previous research, however, which
suggests that people perceive greater value in a single bill
than in several lesser bills that add up to an equal monetary value (Mishra et al., 2006).2 Moreover, this alternative interpretation cannot explain why participants in
the $2 bill condition who were more familiar with the $2
bill estimated it to have greater purchasing power than did
participants who were less familiar.

Mean Perceived Quantity Purchasable per Dollar
(Collapsed Across Three Experiments)
Figure 2. Mean purchasing power estimates across the familiar-currency and unfamiliar-currency
conditions, collapsed across Experiments 1–3.

Nonetheless, in order to eliminate this concern in Experiment 3, all participants completed a questionnaire
depicting a single bill. We contrasted a real $1 bill in the
familiar-currency condition with a subtly altered $1 bill in
the unfamiliar-currency condition. The subtle alterations
made the unfamiliar bill more difficult to process and,
consequently, less familiar but did not affect its format,
quantity, and face value. We expected to produce results
similar to those from Experiments 1 and 2, in which participants perceived greater value in the familiar currency
than in the unfamiliar currency.
Additionally, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that unfamiliar and therefore more disfluently processed currency instruments are undervalued, but any disfluently processed
stimulus should seem less valuable than its more easily
processed counterparts. Accordingly, in Experiment 3, we
included a disfluent-items condition in which we left the
currency unchanged but decreased the fluency of the purchasable goods. Since unfamiliar and therefore disfluent
currency instruments seem to be valued less highly, we
assumed that disfluent consumable items would be valued
less highly than would their fluent counterparts. Consequently, we expected that participants in the disfluentitems condition would attach a lower value to each of the
10 items, ultimately leading them to believe that the dollar
was capable of purchasing more of those goods.
Experiment 3
Method

Participants. A diverse sample of 58 adult participants at a train
station in Princeton Junction, New Jersey, and student participants

in dining halls at Princeton University volunteered to take part in
the experiment.
Design, Materials, and Procedure. Participants completed one
of three questionnaires. The familiar-currency questionnaire depicted a standard $1 bill and was identical to the familiar-­currency
questionnaire from Experiment 1. The unfamiliar-currency questionnaire was the same as the familiar-currency questionnaire, except that, in place of the standard $1 bill, there was a subtly altered
$1 bill (see Figure 1): The altered bill depicted George Washington
facing left instead of right; the “one” seal from the back of the bill
was moved to the front left of the bill; the series seal was moved
from the front left to the front right of the bill; and the position
of the treasurer’s signature at the bottom right of the bill and the
bill’s serial number at the top right of the bill were exchanged. Finally, the disfluent-items questionnaire depicted a standard $1 bill,
but the consumable items were printed in a disfluent 10-point gray,
italicized, Arial font (sample), rather than in the standard 12-point
black Times New Roman font used in the other conditions (sample).
Such font manipulations are a popular method of manipulating the
fluency with which participants process printed information (Alter
& Oppenheimer, 2008b). We did not ask participants how familiar
the notes were, since the altered bill was novel, but we excluded the
responses of 1 participant who questioned its authenticity at the end
of the study.

Results and Discussion
A repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that the
familiarity of the depicted currency and the fluency of
the consumable items influenced participants’ purchasing
power estimates [F(2,18) 5 23.67, p , .001, η p2 5 .73]
(see Figure 3). To examine these effects more closely, we
conducted three planned pairwise contrasts (controlling
for Type I error rates) comparing participants’ purchasing
estimates across the three conditions. As in Experiments 1
and 2, participants in the familiar-currency condition be-

clarity—appeared to have similar effects on participants’
valuation estimates. These convergent results suggest that
familiar stimuli seem more valuable at least in part because they are processed more fluently.

lieved that $1 had greater purchasing power than did those
in the unfamiliar-currency condition across the 10 items
[t(9) 5 2.87, p 5 .018, η 2p 5 .48]; however, participants in
the disfluent-items condition perceived greater purchasing power in the $1 bill than did participants in either the
familiar-currency [t(9) 5 4.61, p 5 .001, η p2 5 .70] or
the unfamiliar-currency [t(9) 5 5.33, p , .001, η 2p 5 .76]
condition.3
These experiments collectively show that unfamiliar
currency instruments and disfluent purchasable goods
appear to be less valuable than their familiar and fluent
counterparts. Indeed, across the monetary familiarity conditions present in all three experiments (and excluding the
disfluent-items condition in Experiment 3), participants
believed that they could purchase greater quantities of 28
of the 30 items (93.33%) with the familiar forms of currency than with the unfamiliar forms of currency, a significantly greater proportion than might be expected by
chance [χ2(1, N 5 30) 5 22.53, p , .001] (see Table 1).
General Discussion
Across three experiments, we found that participants
perceived greater purchasing power in familiar forms of
currency than in their equivalent but less familiar counterparts. This effect held regardless of whether we contrasted
a fluent $1 bill with a rare coin, with a rare bill, or with a
subtly altered version of the same $1 bill. The results of
Experiments 1 and 2 left open the possibility that participants merely responded to the global experience of disfluency that is associated with unfamiliarity by assigning
lower valuation estimates. In Experiment 3, however, we
found that participants perceived that the source of unfamiliarity or disfluency was less valuable, whether the
source was a currency instrument or a consumable item.
This finding suggests that people associate unfamiliarity or disfluency with its specific source, rather than with
the judgment context at large. Consistent with existing
research (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2008b), moreover, two
different instantiations of fluency—familiarity and visual

Theoretical Implications
This article builds on a considerable body of work demonstrating that metacognition influences judgment across
a broad array of domains (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2008b).
Specifically, we found that the metacognitive experience
of disfluency that is associated with processing unfamiliar
stimuli led people to assign lower value to currency instruments and consumable goods.
In addition, Experiment 3 presented novel evidence
that people attribute familiarity or fluency to its specific
source. Rather than generally attenuating participants’
valuation judgments, the experience of disfluency diminished the apparent value only of the stimuli that were unfamiliar or difficult to process. Thus, unfamiliar currency
instruments seemed less valuable than familiar forms of
currency, and consumable goods printed in a difficultto-read font seemed less valuable than the same goods
printed in a clear font.
Just as participants in the present research were capable
of attributing processing ease to its specific source (currency vs. consumable items), people tend to discount fluency as an informative cue when it does not seem to originate from the relevant judgmental target. Thus, although
people generally assume that fluently processed surnames
are more common, they discount fluency as an informative cue when the name is shared by a famous person, such
as Bush, Gore, or Clinton (Oppenheimer, 2004).
Practical Implications
This research suggests that national governments
should think carefully before amending their country’s
currency instruments. In fact, the U.S. government recently introduced numerous currency updates, unveiling
plans to produce a new series of banknotes covering all
denominations from $5 to $100 in August 2008, shortly
after announcing that 38 “Presidential” $1 coins would be
released between 2007 and 2016. A similar announcement
in 1999 preceded the release of 50 “U.S. State” quarters
between 1999 and 2008.
The Treasury’s official motivation for these updates
seems somewhat frivolous: to “return . . . circulating [currency] to its position as an object of aesthetic beauty”
(Presidential $1 Coin Act, 2005). This article suggests that
seemingly innocuous decisions to update currency instruments might diminish the perceived value of the currency,
with unintended economic consequences. More generally,
these findings show that psychological theory has important implications for economic theory and policymaking.
Conclusion
Valuation is a task laden with uncertainty, because there
is no consistent universal scale against which to measure
an item’s value. Many items, such as food and water, seem
more valuable in some contexts (e.g., following a fast)
than in others (e.g., following a feast), and consumable

<-----Page 5----->990     Alter and Oppenheimer
items are so diverse (e.g., a goldfish vs. the services of
a mechanic) that their values are difficult to compare
on a common scale. In response to such uncertainty,
our research suggests that people rely on the ubiquitous
metacognitive cue of fluency to determine the value of
both currency and consumable items. As a simple rule of
thumb, people perceive greater value in easily processed
goods than in their less easily processed, but otherwise
identical, counterparts.

in the unfamiliar-currency condition offered lower estimates because
they did not believe that the Susan B. Anthony coin was legal tender.
This explanation seemed unlikely, since (1) the questionnaire asked participants to estimate the purchasing power of $1, generally, and merely
provided the image of the coin as a reference; (2) none of the participants
reported purchasing power estimates of zero for any of the 10 items,
eliminating the possibility that they believed that the coin was fabricated; (3) when the experimenter collected the completed questionnaire
and explained the purpose of the study, none of the participants questioned the coin’s authenticity; and (4) even after we had eliminated the
4 participants who were completely unfamiliar with the coin, the results
remained significant. Similar analyses in Experiments 2 and 3 allayed
the same concerns.
2. This discrepancy between our results and Mishra et al.’s (2006) is
not surprising, given that their whole–part effect relies on the difficulty
of summing values of multiple bills. Summing two $1 bills after being
told their total value (as participants did in our study) is not comparable
to summing five bills of various denominations to an unknown value (as
participants did in their study). The disfluency engendered by summing
in our study was trivial, and consequently it appears to have been overshadowed by familiarity effects.
3. As in Experiments 1 and 2, we examined the data for evidence
that participants in the unfamiliar-currency condition doubted the altered bill’s authenticity. Except for the 1 participant whose data were
excluded when he recognized that the altered bill was fabricated, none
of the participants provided purchasing power estimates of zero for any
of the 10 items. Thus, the effects were unlikely to have been driven by
participants who believed that the altered currency was fabricated and
therefore valueless.
