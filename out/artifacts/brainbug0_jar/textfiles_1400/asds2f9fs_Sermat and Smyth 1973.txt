CONTENT ANALYSIS OF VERBAL COMMUNICATION
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIONSHIP:
CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE1
VELLO SERMAT a AND MICHAEL SMYTH
York University, Ontario, Canada
The content of conversation between two individuals was investigated under
experimental control by having a subject interact with a confederate over
teletypewriters. The main purpose was to study dimensions of verbal behavior which influence self-disclosure, liking, and a desire to continue the relationship. In the first experiment, the confederate either matched or exceeded
the subject's current self-disclosure level, and also matched or exceeded it in
the questions he asked. Both the confederate's statement and question levels
significantly influenced the subject's self-disclosure level, but questions had
the strongest and most consistently observed effect. In the second experiment,
confederates varied the amount of self-disclosure in their statements between
a "minimal" and "matching" level, while trying to encourage the subject to
disclose more in both conditions. Content analysis revealed no significant differences in the subject's self-disclosure level, related to the experimental manipulation, but subjects in the matching condition reported having disclosed
more about themselves (p < .001) and were more likely to choose the same
partner, if given an opportunity to participate again (p < .001). A number of
sex differences were found, with females asking more intimate questions and
also tending to disclose more about themselves under certain conditions. In addition, two different methods of analyzing the content of conversation were
used. Their relative merits are discussed and suggestions are offered for
future research.

This is an initial report on a research
project, designed to investigate factors which
influence the development of interpersonal
relationships in dyads. The general goal is to
determine which dimensions of verbal behavior facilitate the development of trust,
openness about themselves, and various indexes of attraction between individuals who
are initially unknown to one another. The
experiments reported here have been primarily focused on determinants of selfdisclosure.

Self-disclosure has been denned as the explicit communication to others of some personal information which the others would be
unlikely to acquire unless the person himself
disclosed it, and which is of such a nature
that the individual is not likely to disclose
it to everyone who asks for it (Culbert,
1970). The importance of disclosing personal
and intimate information about oneself has
been emphasized both in the context of forming a friendship and for successful psychotherapy (Jourard, 1964; Mowrer, 1964;
Rogers, 1961). A series of unpublished investigations by the first author of the present
study, based on approximately 400 biographical documents and 400 questionnaires and
personal interviews, has shown that individuals of varying ages and backgrounds attribute their loneliness feelings above all to the
lack of an opportunity to talk about personally important, private matters with someone else. The need to express one's most important thoughts and feelings to an intimate
friend or associate, without fear of being mis332

<-----Page 1----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
understood or rejected, was mentioned spontaneously by a large majority of respondents
as being one of the most important needs in
their lives.
In the present study, self-disclosure was
employed as both an independent and a dependent variable. As former, greater selfdisclosure by one person (a confederate) was
expected to facilitate greater self-disclosure
by the other (the subject). Jourard (19S9)
has proposed that one of the necessary conditions for promoting self-disclosure in the
other is to make disclosures about oneself.
Jourard used the term "dyadic effect" to refer
to the principle that in dyads self-disclosure
tends to be reciprocal. Second, Jourard
(1959) has proposed that the amount of personal information that one person is willing
to disclose to another covaries with his liking
for the other. Accordingly, self-disclosure was
examined in this study as a possible measure
of the extent to which the relationship had
become positively valued by the subject.
Disclosing to someone else personal information about oneself, to which the other's
reaction is not known beforehand, involves
the risk of being misunderstood, judged, rejected, or possibly even exploited in ways that
could be harmful to the discloser. Yalom
(1970) has listed the factors involved in determining the level of risk in self-disclosure.
One is determined by the topic and its importance to the discloser; another involves
the concern that the disclosure may not have
conveyed the message in the way it was intended; a third is the concern about how the
other reacts to the information, and the uncertainty about receiving the kind of response
that was hoped for. Especially the last source
of uncertainty and concern would be reduced
if the other had previously expressed his own
thoughts and feelings on a related topic.
However, certain characteristics in a person's verbal behavior are likely to increase
others' concern over receiving undesirable responses from him and therefore reduce the
probability that they would make self-disclosures which would increase their vulnerability. Gibb (1965) has listed a set of variables which are likely to create a defensive
climate. Among these are judgmental and
evaluative behavior, attempts to control the

333

other's behavior, expressions of superiority,
and dogmatic attitudes. All of these seem to
involve the common element of threatening
the sense of adequacy of the other to the
extent that his self-esteem depends on support from others, or requires that he defend
himself against unfavorable judgments or
attempts at domination. A person who becomes concerned over such threats is more
guarded against revealing himself and is also
more likely to distort the information he receives about the other, due to his defensive
preoccupations and emotional arousal. As the
willingness to take risks decreases, so does
the likelihood of developing a mutually valued
and personal relationship. In a different line
of investigation with dyadic relationships, involving mixed-motive games, it was found
that under conditions which involved uncertainty about the other's behavior and the risk
of being exploited, the interacting individuals
adopted strategies which resulted in less than
optimal outcomes for both (Sermat, 1970).
Although the level of risks taken and selfdisclosures made in a dyad may be reciprocal
over time, it cannot be instantaneously mutual, because one person usually listens while
the other speaks. Since it is uncommon, at
least in our society, for people to make explicit
agreements from the start as to what the
nature of their relationship will be and what
each will contribute to it, they will have to
take some risks in revealing things about
themselves or suggesting some joint activity
in the hope that the other person will reciprocate the move. An individual can take the
initiative during an initial encounter by disclosing something about himself, by asking
the other some questions which require him
to disclose something, or by doing both. If
he asks questions, he puts the other under a
certain amount of pressure, because it is difficult to refuse to answer without seeming uninterested, distrustful or even rude. Thus,
some self-disclosure may result from being
asked certain questions, rather than reflecting a certain degree of liking for the other
person. A person's willingness to answer personal questions may depend on the expectation that the other will reciprocate in a similar manner and that this would further the
relationship. If, in time, it becomes evident

<-----Page 2----->334

VICLLO SF.RMAT AND MICHAEL SMYTH

that the other person will not reciprocate, his
partner's self-disclosure level, liking for him
and willingness to continue the relationship
should decrease. The two experiments described in this article investigated, under controlled conditions, the relationship of one
person's self-disclosure level to the questions
asked and the self-disclosures made by the
other.
Conditions which influence the level of
self-disclosure have been previously investigated by means of questionnaires. Jourard
(1959) and Jourard and Landsman (1960)
found a strong correlation between the
amount of information a person reported disclosing to a given individual and the amount
received from that individual. However, the
actual behavior of these individuals in interpersonal relationships is not known.
Studies of experimental nature are relatively few in number. Tognoli (1969) paired
subjects with confederates and required them
to select discussion topics which were previously scaled for level of intimacy. He found
that subjects chose topics which tended to
match the intimacy level of topics chosen by
the confederates. Worthy, Gary, and Kahn
(1969) placed groups of four female subjects
into a situation where they were to become
acquainted with one another by answering
each other's questions in writing. From a list
of seven questions, scaled for intimacy, the
subjects chose to answer significantly more
intimate questions with those individuals who
had given correspondingly intimate answers.
Jourard and Resnick (1970) matched female undergraduates with high or low scores
on the Jourard Self-Disclosure Questionnaire
(Jourard, 1964) into similar and dissimilar
pairs. In similar pairs, low-disclosing subjects
chose to discuss topics which were rated as
being significantly less intimate than those
chosen by high-disclosing subjects. When a
"high" subject was paired with a "low" one,
the former did not change her disclosure level
while the latter increased hers to a point
where no significant differences remained between them. Taylor, Altaian, and Sorrentino
(1969) had sailors interact with an alleged
future teammate over an intercom system.
The subject was free to choose any number
of conversation topics from a pool of items

prescaled for intimacy (Taylor & Altman,
1966). The other person was a confederate
who systematically varied the interpersonal
reward and cost conditions by agreeing or
disagreeing with the subject. Positive feedback from the confederate led to more disclosure and more favorable sociometric
ratings.
None of the studies mentioned above examined the actual content of the subjects'
verbal messages. As it is possible to answer
any particular question with different amounts
of self-disclosure, the preexperimental ratings
of the intimacy level of the topics selected
for discussion do not give information about
the amount of self-disclosure that actually
took place. In the experiments described in
this article, the subject exchanged verbal messages with a confederate over a set of teletypewriters and the actual content of their
messages was later judged for self-disclosure.
The subject's self-disclosure level was determined by two different methods. In one, two
judges independently selected the three most
disclosive statements and three questions asking for the highest amount of self-disclosure
from the transcript of each participant. The
judges then rank ordered these in terms of
the level of self-disclosure. Items with highest
combined ranks were then given to other
judges who rated them on a 10-point scale of
self-disclosure, anchored in the self-disclosure
scale developed by Taylor and Altman
(1966). A subsequent analysis used a new
scale, composed of items which had been obtained under comparable experimental conditions, using the teletypewriter method, and
had been rated highly reliable by several
judges. A second method of content analysis
involved dividing each transcript into three
parts of equal length and having independent
judges assign ratings on a 10-point scale for
the highest level of self-disclosure attained
in each part of the transcript.
The use of teletypewriters in the study of
verbal communication in dyads has several
important advantages over other methods.
Through the complete elimination of visual
and auditory cues about the other person, his
looks, or voice quality, it is possible to investigate the verbal communication process under
more controlled conditions than would other-

<-----Page 3----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
wise be possible. The use of the teletypewriter
allows for a continuous give-and-take of information, with a minimum of delay between
messages and no restraints on their format.
As a result, most subjects view the experience
as very realistic, after overcoming the initial
unfamiliarity with the equipment. Both the
subject and the confederate have at all times
a complete and permanent record of the interaction that has taken place, and this gives
the confederate an opportunity to inspect
both the subject's behavior and his own and
to take several minutes to decide on the
proper response, while the subject is typing
out his next message.
Preliminary work with the teletypewriter
technique, as well as several experiments
which have been completed since, have shown
that participants tend to become quite intensely and personally involved and will discuss highly intimate topics during the course
of a 1- or 2-hour experiment. Some have even
regarded their experience as amounting to
the beginning of a friendship. With very few
exceptions, the several hundred subjects who
have participated in experiments involving
this method of communication have expressed
willingness and even eagerness to return for
further experimental sessions, without requesting payment or other compensation.
In the experiments reported in this article,
the confederates were instructed to encourage
the subjects to discuss personal topics as
openly as possible, without exercising pressure
toward discussing any particular topical area.
They were to avoid making judgments, analyzing or interpreting the "deeper meaning"
of what the subject said, or taking dogmatic
stands on any issues, in order to minimize
the kinds of behaviors that might make the
subject defensive. The subject was always
informed that he had complete freedom in
choosing what to say, and that he was under
no obligation to answer any questions he did
not like.
The first experiment investigated the effect
of "matching" versus "exceeding" the subject's self-disclosure level in statements made
by the confederate. Culbert (1970) has suggested that greater openness in a relationship
would result if one person makes statements
which are slightly more disclosive than those

335

of the other, and continues to respond to the
other at this "leading" level until an optimal
level of mutual openness has been reached.
Second, the confederate also matched or exceeded the subject's current self-disclosure
level in the questions he directed to the subject. Thus, to the extent that the principle
of reciprocity of "exchange" (Gouldner,
1960; Romans, 1961; Thibaut & Kelley,
1959) is operating, greater self-disclosure by
the confederate should lead to greater selfdisclosure by the subject. If the "social demand" pressures are operating in this situation, then increasingly more intimate questions should lead to increasingly greater selfdisclosure by the subject. The purpose of the
first experiment was to investigate the relative
effectiveness of the statement level and the
question level, and it was expected that the
two variables would interact. Asking for
greater self-disclosure should produce the
greatest amount of disclosure from the subject, provided that the confederate's statements about himself also "led" in self-disclosure. The least amount of self-disclosure
from the subject was expected under the conditions where both the confederate's statements and questions matched the subject's
current level, without leading him to higher
levels. The other two conditions were expected
to be intermediate, and no directional hypothesis was offered. The effect of the confederate's verbal behavior on the self-disclosure level requested in subject's questions
was also investigated, but no specific hypotheses were advanced.
The second experiment required the confederate to ask constantly for a somewhat
higher level of self-disclosure than the subject was offering. In one condition, the confederate then matched the subject's disclosure
in his next statement, while in the other
condition he kept his own self-disclosures
minimal. To the extent that the question
level was of crucial importance, there should
be no difference in the amount of self-disclosure obtained from the subject. However,
if the "reciprocity" principle applies to selfdisclosure, then the confederate's persistent
failure to reciprocate should lead the subject
to express a desire to change his partner.

EXPERIMENT I
Method
Subjects
Students from first-year social science courses at
York University were asked to volunteer and were
offered $2 for a 2-hour session. Forty-three male and
43 female subjects participated in the experiment.
Their age ranged from 18 to 26 years, with a mean
of 18.6 for females and 19.7 for males.

Procedure
Each subject was taken into a separate room,
equipped with a teletypewriter, and instructed in
its use. He was told that he was paired with another student of the same sex, who was in another
room and whom he would not meet afterwards.
They were to get to know each other by exchanging
written messages over the teletypewriters, and the
purpose of the experiment was to study how acquaintanceships begin to develop between total
strangers. There were no rules or restrictions on what
they could say to one another, except that they were
not to use their last names. The reason given for
the latter restriction was that some subjects might
be asked to interact again at some future date, and
it was necessary to prevent them from learning
each other's identities in the meantime. When the
subject asked who was to begin, the experimenter
told him to go ahead. The experimenter then left
the room for 90 minutes, explaining that he would
back to announce when there were 5 minutes left
in which to conclude the session.
The subject was instructed to start each of his
messages with a personal identification symbol, followed by correct time in minutes, and to conclude
his message with a specific symbol which indicated
to the other person that it was now his turn.

Confederate's

Strategy

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four
experimental conditions (see Figure 1) and paired
with a trained confederate who was instructed to
follow a specific strategy in the composition of his
verbal messages. In the match-match condition
(Group 1), the confederate was to match the subject's current level of self-disclosure in each of his
own messages and to keep his questions to the
same level. In the exceed-match condition (Group
2), the confederate was to exceed the subject's selfdisclosure level by a moderate amount in his statements but not in his questions. In the match-exceed
condition (Group 3), the confederate was to exceed
in questions but not in statements about himself.
Finally, in the exceed-exceed condition (Group 4),
the confederate was to disclose more about himself
than the subject had done, and also to ask for increasing amounts of self-disclosure.
Two male and two female confederates each interacted with an equal number of subjects of their
own sex in each of the experimental conditions. One
19-year-old and one 20-year-old undergraduate
served as female confederates, while a 20-year-old
undergraduate and a 23-year-old graduate student
served as male confederates. All confederates were
previously trained in the use of the matching and
exceeding strategies in the teletype situation, but had
to depend on their own judgment during the actual
experiment. Ratings by independent judges were
used to determine whether they had adhered to the
correct strategy.
Confederates were to avoid all judgmental and
evaluative behavior, even with regard to themselves,
unless a certain type of self-disclosure from the subject necessitated that the confederate respond with
a disclosure which might be construed as implying
evaluation of oneself. Whenever the confederate
could comfortably do so and the nature of the con-

<-----Page 5----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
versation did not dictate otherwise, he was to try
to be genuinely himself. In the exceed conditions,
confederates were free to suggest new topics for
exploration (e.g., loneliness, sexual mores, social
problems, dating, financial circumstances, relationships with parents, etc.), but they were not to
persist if the subject appeared to be unwilling.

Assessment of the Independent Variable
Each of the teletype transcripts was divided into
statement and question units, which consisted of one
or more sentences or questions which were contiguous
with one another and pertained to the same topic.
A judge who was not familiar with the experiment
or the identity of the members of a dyad read each
transcript and compared the self-disclosure level of
each unit in the total message sent by one person to
the self-disclosure level of the most disclosive statement made by the other person in his just preceding
message. A message consisted of all the questions and
statements made by one person between the end of
the last message and the beginning of the next
message from the other person.
The level of self-disclosure in a given speech unit
by Person A was compared with the self-disclosure
level of the most disclosive unit by Person B, pertaining to the same topic. If A introduced a new
topic, its self-disclosure level was compared with the
most disclosive unit in the preceding message of
Person B. The comparison was made on a 7-point
scale, with the scale points labeled from "extreme
increase in self-disclosure" through "equal selfdisclosure" to "extreme decrease in self-disclosure."
To obtain an estimate of the reliability of the
judge's ratings, three other judges made independent
ratings of relative self-disclosure on 25 of the total
86 transcripts. For 84.3% of statement units and
85.1% of question units, the differences between
judges' ratings did not exceed 1 point on the 7-point
scale. The intercorrelations of the main judge's ratings with the other three judges were .62, .61, and
.47 for statement units and .75, .58, and .55 for
question units. In view of the fact that the large
majority of ratings fell within a single scale point
interval between "equal self-disclosure" and "slight
increase in self-disclosure," and very few fell outside
the 3-point range between "slight decrease in selfdisclosure" and "moderate increase in self-disclosure,"
the reliability of judges' ratings, though not high,
was considered acceptable.
The confederate was considered to have met the
exceed condition if the self-disclosure level of his
statements and/or questions exceeded the subject's
current self-disclosure level at least once within
each message. From the above data, an average
self-disclosure level for the confederate's statements
and questions, relative to the self-disclosure level of
the subject, was calculated for the whole transcript.
A three-way analysis of variance was carried out on
these data (Relative Statement Level X Relative
Question Level X Sex). The results showed that
with all 86 subjects included in the analysis, the
error term accounted for more than 50% of the

337

variance. 3 A subset of data which met more stringent criteria for the confederate's behavior was
therefore selected for the following analysis.
Four per cell analysis. For each confederate, those
four subjects in each of the experimental conditions
with whom his experimental strategy matched most
closely the prescribed conditions were included in
the final analysis (Total N-64). Of the 22 subjects
eliminated, 19 were discarded because the independent
check indicated that the confederate's behavior had
not satisfied the requirements for the prescribed
experimental treatment, 2 were dropped because the
confederate had asked an insufficient number of
questions, and 1 subject was eliminated because he
had expressed suspiciousness about the experimental
procedure. A three-way analysis of variance of the
confederate's relative self-disclosure level was carried
out with this new subset of data, and it showed
that experimental manipulations now accounted for
62% of the question variance and 85% of the statement variance in the confederate's behavior.*

Measuring the Dependent Variable
Analysis by item. Two judges, working independently, selected and then rank ordered from the
transcript of each experimental session three statements and three questions by the subject which they
judged to have the highest absolute self-disclosure
level. The ranks were then pooled, and the two statements and two questions from each transcript which
were ranked highest in self-disclosure by both
judges, or had the highest average rank, were
selected for the final analysis.
Each item was typed on a separate card and
judged for self-disclosure level on a 10-point scale
by another set of four judges who had not read the
remainder of the transcript and were not familiar
with the experimental hypotheses. The scale values
were anchored in examples taken from the selfdisclosure scales of Taylor and Altaian (1966), but
the judges were told that these examples served only
as rough indicators of various levels of self-disclosure
and could be ignored whenever they appeared to be
not appropriate to the item in question. The interjudge Pearson product-moment correlations ranged
from .80 to .91 for statements, and from .82 to .92
for questions, for the four judges. The following
three examples from the Taylor and Altman scale
3

All percentage of variance calculations were performed by the method suggested by Gaito (1958).
4
Two additional analyses were undertaken. In one,
only data from those subjects were included where
no overlap existed in the confederate's relative disclosure levels from one condition to another (^V —
56), In the second analysis, a sample of 32 transcripts, representing each sex and condition, was
selected so that the ratio of the confederate's statements and questions was kept constant between experimental conditions. Both analyses yielded essentially the same results as reported above and are
omitted from this report (see Smyth, 1970, for a
detailed account).

illustrate the guidelines used by judges:

Postexperimental Questionnaire

My views on sexual morality. How I feel that I and
others ought to behave in sexual matters. (Mean =
7.50)
My feelings about how much independence I need.
(Mean = 5.43)
My views on drinking. (Mean = 3.00)

After completing the teletype conversation, cacli
subject was given a questionnaire which required
him to indicate on a 7-point scale (a) the degree of
his "liking" for his conversation partner (the confederate) ; (b) to what extent he perceived himself
and the other person as having been "open" about
personally important topics; (c) to what extent he
felt that he and his partner had expressed interest
in one another; and (d) to what extent he perceived
himself to be similar or dissimilar to his partner in
personality characteristics. Finally, he was asked to
indicate whether, in retrospect, he would have preferred to interact with the other person in a face to
face situation or over the teletypewriters. The complete questionnaire, together with other procedural
details, is found in Smyth (1970).
Following this, the experimenter conducted an
open-ended interview with the subject, in order to
detect any possible suspicions on the part of the
participants about the experimental procedure. The
subjects were then told in general terms about the
nature of the research involved, and were asked not
to discuss the experiment with others. They were
not fully debriefed before the conclusion of the
experiment, in order to avoid possible spread of information among other prospective subjects about
the type of deception used, but were told to check
back with the experimenter a few months later, at
which time, if interested, they would receive a fuller
account of the study and its findings.

The initial division of the transcripts into statement and question units was carried out by the
second author. Among the 344 items which constituted the final item pool, only five minor disagreements occurred between the two independent judges
concerning the choice of the proper unit length.
The two statements and two questions judged most
disclosive constituted the main dependent measure of
the study. In order to determine whether the differences between experimental conditions were specific
to the most disclosive items only or would be replicated with a second set of items, two separate statistical analyses were carried out: Analysis 1 involved
the items with the highest self-disclosure rating in
each transcript, and Analysis 2 involved the items
with the second highest self-disclosure ratings.
Analysis by transcript. Each transcript was divided
into three sections of equal length. Two judges rated
each section of each transcript on a 10-point selfdisclosure scale. This scale was anchored in 41 guideline items, developed for another study, which had
received highly reliable self-disclosure ratings from
several judges. Three of these items are shown below:
I am really lucky, I guess, because I know what
I'm here at university for and know I couldn't
get what I want anywhere else. [Rating = 3.0]
I think my trouble this year about meeting anybody
is that during orientation week I broke with my
"steady" and had a pretty rough time getting over
it. And when I did it was October, and most of
the kids had subdivided themselves into the groups
they wanted to be in. This makes it tough to
crack into these little groups. So I played cool and
stayed with people I knew from my old school.
[Rating = 5.0]
[In response to the question, How come you have
no girlfriend?] Plain shyness, I guess. I have
always had a hangup with girls. I don't even
bother going to dances or parties now. Money is
no problem and I always have plenty of time. How
wouldn't I, with no girls around?! [Rating = 7.0]
The ratings of the two judges of the self-disclosure
level of subject statements correlated .50 for the
first section of the transcripts, .72 for the second
section, .72 for the third, and .81 for the total
scores. The question self-disclosure levels were not
rated. The analysis by transcript method was developed in an attempt to find a more economical, yet
reliable way of analysis which would be based on
the total content of the transcript and would also
provide information about sequential changes in the
self-disclosure level over time.

Results
Analysis by Item
An initial analysis of variance showed no
significant effects due to differences between
confederates. The subjects run by two confederates of the same sex were therefore combined in the subsequent analyses, where the
term "sex" consistently refers to both the sex
of the subject and sex of the confederate.
Table 1 shows the mean self-disclosure values
of subject statements and subject questions
divided by sex and condition. Analysis 1 refers to the most disclosive item in each transcript; Analysis 2 refers to the next most disclosive item in each transcript.
Subject statements. Analysis 1 showed a
significant question effect (F = 22.10, dj =
1/S6, p < .005) and statement effect (F =
4.92, dj = 1/56, p < .05). The group means
ranked 4, 3, 2, and 1 from highest to lowest.
A Duncan range test indicated that all differences between means, except for those between Groups 2 and 3 and 2 and 4, were significant at the .05 level of confidence. The sex
and interaction effects were small and non-

<-----Page 7----->339

CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
significant. Thus, the results confirm the hypothesis that Group 4 (exceed-exceed) would
produce the highest level of self-disclosure
and Group 1 (match-match) would produce
the lowest, while Groups 2 and 3 produced an
intermediate level of self-disclosure and did
not differ significantly from one another.
However, the question effect was by far the
strongest and accounted for 3&% of the total
variance in Analysis 1, while the statement
effect accounted for only 7%.
Analysis 2 again yielded a significant question effect (F = 14.10, df = 1/56, p < .005),
which accounted for 25% of the total variance. The statement effect was not significant,
but the interaction between question and
statement was significant at the .05 level (F
-5.42, d f = 1/56), accounting for 17% of
the variance. This appears to result from a
relatively small difference between the means
of question-exceed conditions (Groups 3 and
4), compared to question-match conditions
(Groups 1 and 2).
Subject questions. In both Analyses 1 and
2, a significant sex effect was found, indicating that female subjects asked more intimate
questions than did males (F = 6.76 and 5.35,
respectively, p < .05). A significant effect
due to the question level of the confederate
was found in Analysis I (F — 5.77, df =
1/54, p < .05). A Duncan range test showed
that subjects in Group 1 asked significantly
less intimate questions than subjects in
Groups 3 and 4. In Analysis 2, none of the
group means differed significantly from one
another. It is also evident that the level of
self-disclosure in the confederate's statements
had no significant influence on the intimacy
level of subject's questions.

sistently asked for more intimate disclosures
from the subject, showed a more-or-less linear
increase in self-disclosure over the three sections of the transcript. Again, the evidence
strongly supported the hypothesis that asking
for more intimate self-disclosure tends to
elicit it, other things being equal, but that
exceeding in one's own self-disclosures has a
much weaker effect on the other person's
self-disclosure level, and this effect is primarily noticeable only when not overshadowed by asking directly for more intimate
information.
Post experimental Questionnaire
No significant differences were found in
questions related to "liking" and "perceived
interest in the other." Subject's estimate of
his own openness regarding personally important topics produced a significant interaction
of Statement X Question (F - 4.56, df 1/55, p < .05). Subjects perceived themselves
as having been most open in Group 3, where
the confederate's questions consistently asked

for more self-disclosure, although he did not
exceed in his disclosures, and least open in
Group 1, where the confederate neither asked
for, nor offered, self-disclosures beyond the
subject's current level. This perception supports the findings from judges' ratings, particularly in analysis by transcript. A significant Sex X Statement interaction was also
found (F = 4.84, df = 1/55, p < .05), with
the highest degree of openness being reported
by male subjects with whom the confederate
had exceeded in his own disclosures. Their
group mean was 5.22, while the means for
males in "statement-match" condition and
for females in all conditions ranged from 2.50
to 2.89.
The item asking the subject to rate how
open the confederate had been about personally important topics yielded a significant statement effect (F = 8.61, df = 1/56,
p < .025). Subjects correctly perceived the
confederate as having disclosed more about
himself in the statement-exceed condition
(Groups 2 and 4) than in the statementmatch condition (Groups 1 and 3). This item
essentially confirms that the experimental manipulation, with regard to the confederate's
self-disclosure level, was carried out and that
the subjects were aware of its effect.
The extent to which the subject perceived
himself and the confederate as having similar
personality traits was significantly related to
the confederate's statement level (F — 4.37,
df = 1/56, p< .05) and to the sex of the
confederate and the subject (F = 6.79, df —
1/56, p< .025), and also yielded an interaction effect between statement and sex
(F - 8.79, df = 1/56, p < .005). Female
subjects perceived themselves as more similar
to the confederate than did males, and greater
similarity was perceived by both sexes when
the confederate exceeded in his statement
level. Males reported a particularly low level
of perceived similarity in the statementmatch condition, while females reported the
reverse.
Finally, the subjects were asked whether
they would have preferred the teletype or a
face to face interaction. A chi-square of 4.13
(df = 1, p < .05) showed that preference was
significantly related to the confederate's
statement level: Subjects in the statement-

<-----Page 9----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
match condition preferred face to face interaction, while subjects in the statement-exceed
condition preferred the teletypewriter!
Discussion
The primary goal of this experiment was
to determine the relative effect of two variables on the subject's level of self-disclosure:
the confederate's self-disclosure level and the
level of intimate disclosure he asked for in
his questions. The results showed that both
variables significantly influenced the subject's
self-disclosure level but that the question
level had by far the strongest and most consistently observed effect. It appeared sufficient for the purpose of eliciting relatively
personal disclosures from another person if
one consistently matched his disclosure level
while probing for further information with
more intimate questions.
The fact that, when the confederate's turn
came, his self-disclosure level consistently
matched or exceeded the level of the statement just made by the subject may be a
critical precondition for obtaining this result.
The subject may have felt safe in answering
probing questions, because he had learned
that his partner would always reciprocate his
self-disclosures. To determine whether matching was necessary for producing self-disclosures, a second experiment was carried out.
In one condition, the confederate matched
the self-disclosure level of the subject, while
in the other he gave only minimal information about himself. In both conditions, he
continued to ask questions which exceeded
the subject's current self-disclosure level.
The uniqueness of the experimental situation may also have contributed toward the
strong question effect. After the experiment,
many subjects commented that they had had
initial doubts about the teletype situation as
one in which one could communicate meaningfully with another person. As the experimentional session progressed, the subjects
seem to have forgotten their initial reservations and generally reported afterwards that
they saw the relationship as quite real and
had enjoyed the experiment. In the early
stages of the experiment, however, the confederate's probing questions may have served
to define "what to do" in this unfamiliar

341

situation, and the subjects may have been
more willing to disclose, due to their uncertainty as to what constituted "normal" behavior under the circumstances. The fact that
the experimental situation generally became
rewarding in its own right seemed to be indicated by the generally high level of satisfaction expressed by the subjects, their willingness to volunteer for additional sessions
without pay or course credit, and occasional
remarks in transcripts and postexperimental
interviews that they felt a genuine friendship had begun to form between them and
their partner.
Another possible reason why the confederate's exceeding in both questions and selfdisclosures in Group 4 did not produce consistently higher results in self-disclosure than
his asking more intimate questions did in
Group 3 may be related to the fact that in
Group 4 the confederate spoke more about
himself. The statement-exceed rule required
him to volunteer personal information at a
higher level of intimacy than the subject had
done, and thus he necessarily had to initiate
discussion on aspects or topics which the
subject had not yet touched upon. From this,
the subject may have concluded that his
partner was eager to talk about himself and
may have gone along, asking questions and
expressing interest, but talking less about his
own problems or experiences. Subsequent to
this study, a number of content-analysis
scales have been developed, such as "expressing interest in the other person," which
would enable one to answer such questions. Among the presently available data, the
one item which was in line with this interpretation was the subjects' report in the postexperimental questionnaire that they had disclosed more about themselves in Group 3 than
in Group 4.
The "reciprocity effect" was, interestingly
enough, more evident in the self-disclosure
level of questions asked by the subject than
in his statements about himself. When the
confederate's questions exceeded the subject's
current self-disclosure level, the subject also
asked more intimate questions. It was clear
that the "norm" of getting into more intimate
topics was set in both statements and questions coming from the confederate, but the

<-----Page 10----->342

VELLO SEKMAT AND MICHAEL SMYTH

risk of asking a more intimate question in
return was comparatively smaller than that
of giving more intimate information about
oneself.
In the self-disclosure level of questions
asked, a sex difference was also evident.
Female subjects tended to ask more intimate
questions than did males. This finding was
in line with what is believed to be true about
the different sex roles of the North American
society: It seems more appropriate for females than for males to express interest
in interpersonal matters (cf. Goodenough,
1957). In a recent study, Janofsky (1971)
found that females tended to disclose more
about themselves than did males. In our
study, the only significant finding related to
the subject's own self-disclosure was a Sex X
Statement Level interaction in analysis by
transcripts: When the confederate matched
his own self-disclosure level to that of the
subject, males disclosed significantly less
about themselves than males in the statement-exceed condition (/><.01), females
in statement-match condition (p < .05),
or females in statement-exceed condition
(p < .01). Also, males in Group 3, while
apparently telling more about themselves,
perceived their male partner as more dissimilar to themselves than did subjects in
other conditions. This suggests that they perceived the confederate, who was asking increasingly intimate questions, as acting in a
manner not ordinarily expected of other males.
Some unanticipated difficulties were also
encountered in this experiment. Otherwise
"good" data had to be discarded when it was
found that some subjects in Group 4 had
made such intimate disclosures that the confederates were unable to exceed their self-disclosure level consistently in their own statements. To avoid this problem in the future,
it may be necessary to specify a "ceiling"
level, beyond which the confederate is only
required to match, not to exceed, the subject's
statements.
From a methodological viewpoint, a comparison of the relative merits and disadvantages of the two content-analysis methods, by
item and by transcript, was of interest. A
strict comparison was complicated by the fact
that in each case, different judges, as well as

different examples for identifying the different
levels of the 10-point self-disclosure scale,
were used. An obvious advantage of the
analysis by sections was that it took only half
the judges and a fraction of the time required by the more elaborate analysis by item
method. In addition, it could be argued that
a considerable amount of information is lost
when only two or three most disclosive items
are selected from each transcript for a statistical analysis. On the other hand, when
lengthy sections of the transcript were read
for the purpose of arriving at an overall selfdisclosure rating, it was difficult to locate the
evidence which led to this decision, and the
possibility existed that self-disclosure ratings
attributed to one person may be influenced
by having the judge read the statements of
the other.
A genuine difference between the two procedures was indicated by the fact that the
means obtained by analyzing transcript sections were consistently lower, as was apparent
from a comparison of the data in Table 1 and
Figure 2. The two methods of analysis were
also compared in a subsequent experiment
(Crowe, 1972), using the same guideline
items and having a group of judges randomly
rate one-half of the transcripts by each
method in a counterbalanced order. Again, the
analysis by transcript yielded consistently
lower means than the analysis by item. In
both experiments, the rank-order among the
group means was essentially uninfluenced by
the method, while the main effects of experimental treatment were somewhat enhanced by
the analysis of transcript method. A possible
explanation is that individual statements
may receive artificially high self-disclosure
ratings when read out of the broader context
in which they occurred, or that the presence
of less disclosive or irrelevant statements
tends to suppress the ratings that most disclosive items would otherwise receive.
In terms of interjudge reliabilities, the two
methods again appeared to be roughly comparable, with the analysis by item method
apparently being slightly superior. In the
present study, the product-moment correlations based on ratings by four judges using
the most disclosive items ranged from .80 to
.91, while the combined total scores, based on

<-----Page 11----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSURE
the three sections, yielded an interjudge correlation of .81 and the correlations for individual transcript sections were lower. The
same two judges achieved a correlation coefficient of .93 in Experiment II, by using
the analysis by item method. In the experiment by Crowe (1972), the analysis by item
method yielded interjudge correlations ranging from .72 to .86, while the analysis by
transcript method yielded correlations ranging
from .69 to .74. The most likely explanation
of the somewhat lower reliability of the
analysis by transcript method was that it employed some sort of "scanning" technique in
which the judges went over a section of a
transcript and quickly identified its high
points of self-disclosure, on which the overall
rating was based, but the high points attended to by different judges were not necessarily the same.
In conclusion, it appears that the two
methods tap essentially the same phenomena
and that the lowering of mean self-disclosure
values, obtained by the analysis by transcript
method, did not result in any loss of power
of analysis.
EXPERIMENT II
Method
Subjects
Twelve male and 12 female undergraduates from
York University were paired with same-sex confederates for a 90-minute experimental session. The age
of the male subjects ranged from 18 to 21 years,
with a mean of 19.S8 years; the age range for
female subjects was from 18 to 23, with a mean of
19.66 years. The subjects were paid $2 for participation in the experiment.

Confederates
Six male and six female undergraduates who were
enrolled in an advanced psychology course dealing
with interpersonal processes, and had received some
training in face to face communication skills, were
paid $4 to serve as confederates. Each confederate
served with two different subjects.

Confederate's Strategy
Each confederate used two experimental procedures, one with each subject, in a counterbalanced
order.
The "minimal" condition. In this condition, the
confederates were instructed to volunteer as little
personal information about themselves as possible,
while trying to ask questions which would encourage

343

subjects to disclose more about themselves. This was
to be done in a manner that would create the impression that what the subject had to say was more
interesting to the confederate than anything he could
tell about himself. The confederate was to give answers which were adequate enough to avoid arousing
suspicion or hostility in the subject.
The "matching" condition. This condition was
similar to the match-exceed treatment in Group 3
of the first experiment: The confederate was to
match the subject's level of self-disclosure in statements about himself, while asking questions which
required answers that exceeded the subject's current
self-disclosure level.

Postexperimental Questionnaire
A revised questionnaire was administered to all
subjects at the conclusion of the 90-minute experimental session. The subjects were asked to indicate
on a 7-point scale the following:
(1) To what extent did you reveal things about
yourself which you would consider personal,
or would only trust to tell your close friends?
(2) Same question referring to the other person.
(3) Did you feel that you and your partner were
similar to each other in important ways; that
is, had common interests, attitudes, experiences, etc.?
(4) To what extent did you develop a liking or
disliking for your partner?
In addition, the subjects were asked (a) whether
they would like to participate in this experiment
again without receiving any course credit or payment if they had the opportunity and (6) whether
they would like the same partner or would prefer
another one.

Data Analysis
From each transcript, two judges independently
selected and rank ordered five subject statements
they considered to be most disclosive. The rank of
these items were then pooled and the two most
disclosive items were assigned to Analysis 1 and
Analysis 2, respectively.
First, these two sets of data were rated by four
independent judges, using the Taylor and Altman
(1966) scale as a guideline. The correlations between
their ratings ranged from .69 to .94. At a later date,
the two judges who used the 41-item guideline for
making self-disclosure ratings in Experiment I independently rated both sets of items, achieving an
intercorrelation of .93 between their ratings and
correlations of .88 and .87 with a third judge.

Results
Subject Statements
The pooled ratings of the first four judges
yielded no significant differences. The combined ratings of the last three judges, who

<-----Page 12----->344

VELLO SERMAT AND MICHAEL SMYTH

achieved more satisfactory interjudge reliabilities, showed only one significant main
effect: The mean self-disclosure level (2.94)
of the most disclosive items of male subjects
was significantly lower than the mean (4.33)
for the most disclosive items of female
subjects (F = 4.75, df = 1/16, p < .05).
Postexperimental Questionnaire
A number of significant and near significant
effects appeared in the subjects' self-report
data on their reactions to the experiment. On
all these analysis of variance data, the degrees
of freedom are 1 and 16.
Item 1, asking the subject how much personal information he had disclosed to the
other, yielded a highly significant statement
effect (/? = 30.08, / > < . 0 0 1 ) : Subjects felt
that they had revealed more about themselves in the match condition. In addition,
male subjects reported having disclosed more
personal information than did female subjects (F = 10.08, p < .025), while the content analysis suggested that the opposite was
the case. A significant Statement X Sex interaction was also found (F = 10.08, p < .025),
with the greatest amount of self-disclosure
being reported by males in the match condition. In the minimal condition, both males
and females perceived themselves as having
disclosed very little (both had means of 4.8
on a 5-point scale, where 1 stands for "a
great deal" and 5 stands for "none or almost
none").
No differences were found on Item 2 (the
other person's self-disclosures). On Item 3,
female subjects reported that they were more
similar to their partners than did male subjects (F - 9.80, p< .01). The Statement X
Sex interaction was almost significant at the
.05 level (F = 4.26), with females reporting
a fairly high degree of similarity in the match
condition while males viewed themselves and
their partners as being only moderately similar in the minimal condition and even less so
in the match condition. The Statement X
Order X Sex interaction was significant at the
.05 level (F = 4.56), but its trends are difficult to interpret.
On Item 4, subjects reported somewhat
more liking for the partner in the match than
in the minimal condition (F = 4.30, p <

.10). However, the Statement X Sex interaction was significant at almost the .01 level
(F = 8.49). Males reported slightly more liking for their minimally disclosive partners,
while females almost consistently indicated
very high liking for partners in the match
condition and the lowest liking ratings of all
subjects in the minimal condition.
When asked whether they would like to
return for further experimental sessions without any course credit or payment, all subjects, except a male in the minimal condition,
answered affirmatively. However, when given
the choice between the same partner and
someone else, 10 subjects in the match condition chose the same, one chose another, and
one answered, "It makes no difference to me."
In the minimal condition, 6 subjects chose the
same partner and 6 chose someone else. Omitting the "no difference" case, the chi-square
of this distribution was 13.68 (/><.001),
corrected for discontinuity. Thus, subjects in
the match condition were more willing to continue interacting with the same partner than
were subjects in the minimal condition.
Discussion
This experiment attempted to determine
whether the subject's self-disclosures and his
attitude toward his partner would be affected
by a lack of self-disclosure from the latter.
The content analysis showed no significant
difference in the subject's response to the two
confederate strategies: matching the subject's
disclosure or providing only minimal disclosure about himself. The overall disclosure
levels in Experiment II were lower than those
observed in Groups 3 and 4 of Experiment I.
However, the self-report data from subjects
told a different story: Subjects in the match
condition felt that they had disclosed significantly more about themselves to their partners (p < .001), and were much more likely
to choose the same partner again if given an
opportunity to participate in another experimental session than were subjects in the
minimal condition (p < .001).
In view of the fact that two independent
sets of judges, one of which achieved high
reliabilities in judging the self-disclosure level,
failed to find significant differences in the content analysis, the more likely interpretation

<-----Page 13----->CONDITIONS INFLUENCING SELF-DISCLOSUKE
seems to be that subjects felt differently about
their own disclosures in the two experimental
conditions. They may have felt that they were
only complying with the pressure exerted by
their partner in the minimal condition and
did not view the situation as at all characteristic of the way they related to their friends
and acquaintances. Having perceived the
whole experience as a fairly impersonal one,
they may have rated their own disclosures
differently on a scale of intimacy.
Some sex differences were again found.
While the content-analysis data suggested that
females disclosed more about themselves than
did males (p < .05), in self-report data males
reported as having disclosed more (p < .025).
The main source of this difference comes
from males in the matching condition who
rated themselves as having disclosed between
"a moderate amount" and "quite a bit,"
while females rated their disclosures much
lower in that condition. In the minimal condition, subjects of both sexes rated their disclosures as being "none or almost none." In
this context it may be worth recalling that in
Experiment I, males disclosed less about themselves in the statement-match condition than
did females, and that females generally asked
more intimate questions than did males.
Furthermore, females in Experiment II perceived themselves as more similar to their
partners (p < .01) and there was an almost
significant interaction of the confederate's
self-disclosure level with sex, with females
perceiving the "matching" partners as highly
similar to themselves, while males perceived
somewhat greater similarity in the minimal
than in the match condition. All these differences are consistent with the view that males
are inclined to disclose less about themselves
than are females, and also view other males
who make intimate disclosures as acting in a
manner somewhat atypical of the predominant
cultural norm.
The findings of Experiment II tend to confirm the expectation that a failure to reciprocate the other person's self-disclosure while
asking him to disclose more is detrimental to
the prospects of developing an interpersonal
relationship. One might expect that if the confederate continued to ask for unilateral selfdisclosures from the subject during a pro-

345

longed period, genuine differences in the subject's self-disclosure level would also begin to
emerge. Among the possible reasons why such
a "disillusionment effect" did not manifest
itself in the subjects' verbal behavior in Experiment II are the following: The total
length of the session may have been too short;
the overall self-disclosure level may have been
too low for subjects to experience any serious
threat when the confederate did not reciprocate their disclosures; or verbal behavior of
the relatively inexperienced confederates may
have been so uneven as to reduce the intended effect of the experimental manipulation. It must be remembered that the number
of confederates was large. The decison to employ 12 confederates was made in order to increase the generalizability of the findings, so
that results could not easily be attributed to a
possibly idiosyncratic or unusually effective
behavior of any single confederate. However,
these confederates, although given the same
instructions that were used in Experiment I,
did not have the amount of experience or
long-term commitment to the study which
characterized confederates in Experiment I.
This, combined with the small number of subjects, may have reduced the likelihood of
obtaining significant findings. In view of the
apparent lack of significant differences in content analysis, the analysis by transcript
method was not applied to these data, nor
were subjects' question levels examined.
Self-disclosure is obviously an important
dimension, both as a precondition for encouraging openness in the other person, and also
as one of the indexes of the extent to which
the relationship has progressed. It deserves
further investigation, but needs to be supplemented by the study of other dimensions.
Fourteen scales for analyzing various other
characteristics of verbal behavior, including
the threat-inducing variables mentioned in
the introduction, have been developed, have
undergone a series of revisions while tested
against experimental data, and will hopefully
be used in future studies. The teletype
method, which combines a high degree of experimental control while eliciting significant
content and considerable personal involvement on the part of the participants, seems
well-suited for this kind of investigation.
