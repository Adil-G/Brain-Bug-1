This research investigates how a strong personal relationship (strong tie)
between a small business owner-manager and his professional or informal
advisor affects the relationship between the advisor’s recent performance
and the owner-manager’s perceptions of the advisor’s trustworthiness in
terms of ability, benevolence and integrity. A negative moderating effect
could point to a ‘tie that blinds’: the owner-manager may be less critical
in evaluating the advisor’s perceived trustworthiness in light of their recent
performance, because of the existing personal relationship. A conceptual
model is constructed and examined with survey data comprising 153 young
Finnish businesses. The results show that strong ties increase the ownermanager’s perception of the advisor’s integrity, disregarding their recent
performance. For professional advisors, strong ties reduce the impact of
recent performance in the owner-manager’s evaluation of their ability.
For informal advisors, a strong tie makes it more likely that their
benevolence will be evaluated highly in light of their recent performance.
While the results show that ‘ties can blind’ under certain circumstances,
the limitations of the study raise the need for further research to specify
these contextual factors and examine the causal link between the choice
of advisor and business performance.

1. Introduction
A small firm is unlikely to possess internally the full range of knowledge and skills
that it requires, or could benefit from, for the development of its business (Bryson
and Daniels 1998; Hurmerinta-Peltomäki and Nummela 2004; Smallbone, North,
and Leigh 1993). Hence, the ability to acquire suitable external expertise when
needed either from professional (e.g. consultants, solicitors, accountants and
enterprise support officers) or informal advisors (e.g. family members, friends and
former colleagues) becomes a competitive factor in itself. Previous studies suggest
that trust may play an important role in a small business owner-manager’s decision

of whom to turn to when external expertise is required (Bennett and Robson 1999,
2004; Welter and Kautonen 2005). However, the nascent discussion on the ‘dark
side’ of trust (Tonoyan 2005; Zahra, Yavuz, and Ucbasaran 2006) and ‘over-trust’
(Goel and Karri 2006) suggests that trust is not always a positive attribute in
entrepreneurial contexts. The functionality of trust in a particular context depends
on whether it is warranted or not. This ‘dark side’ of trust has not been previously
addressed in studies focusing on the small business owner-manager’s decision to
acquire external expertise, and there are few empirical studies on the ‘dark side’
of trust more generally.
Prior research has found that small business owners tend to favour previously
well-known people when selecting advisors (Berry, Sweeting, and Goto 2006; Burke
and Jarratt 2004; Ramsden and Bennett 2005). This study asks whether a strong
personal relationship – a strong tie (Granovetter 1973) – between the owner-manager
and the advisor could develop into a ‘tie that blinds’ in the owner-manager’s
assessment of the advisor’s trustworthiness. This would mean that the ownermanager becomes less careful in the evaluation of the advisor’s actual performance
with respect to their trustworthiness because of the strength of their personal
relationship.
A ‘tie that blinds’ could compromise the functionality of trust in choosing an
advisor: the owner-manager might keep on turning to a well-known and perceived
to be trustworthy advisor even if the advisor’s recent performance had not lived
up to expectations. Such behaviour can have a detrimental impact on business
development if the advisor is outside their ability to perform, if more competent
advisors are available, if the advisor is not serving the best interests of the client
or if the advisor is operating with questionable integrity (Raiser 1999; Welter and
Kautonen 2005). Moreover, emphasizing the relationship rather than recent
performance as a criterion in the selection of advisors sets a false incentive for
advisors to focus on building the relationship with the small business owner, rather
than striving for the optimal solution to the actual business problem.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold. In terms of theory development, this
research adds to the emerging literature on the ‘dark side’ of trust in the small
business context and, more generally, by examining empirically whether and how
a strong personal relationship may cloud the business owner’s judgement of their
advisor’s trustworthiness in terms of ability, integrity and benevolence (Mayer,
Davis, and Schoorman 1995). While the results show that ‘ties can blind’ under
certain circumstances, the limitations of the study point to the need for further
research to specify these contextual factors in more detail and examine the causal
link between the choice of advisor and the performance of the firm. In practical
terms, the authors discuss a number of potential pitfalls of close personal
relationships when small business owners seek advice, help and support from
professional and informal advisors.

2. Conceptual framework
The conceptual model developed in this study (Figure 1) postulates that the three
dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (ability, integrity and benevolence) are
influenced by the advisor’s recent performance as perceived by the owner-manager
and the strength of tie between the owner-manager and the advisor. The model

further suggests that the strength of tie not only affects perceived trustworthiness
directly, but also that it moderates the effect of the advisor’s recent performance.
The following sections discuss the conceptual foundations of the model.
2.1. Perceived trustworthiness
The definition of trust has been the subject of debate in a number of different
literatures, but especially in the business context it is beginning to converge on the
‘willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the
expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor,
irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party’ (Mayer, Davis, and
Schoorman 1995, 712; see also Nooteboom 2002; Rousseau et al. 1998). The
psychological state of trust can be based upon personal knowledge of the trustee or
institutional context (Zucker 1986). Since our focus in this research is on the
development of trust in a relationship between the owner-manager and the advisor,
we limit the analysis to personal trust only.
Personal trust, based upon personal interaction and cumulative experiences
with the trustee (Sztompka 1999; Yamagishi and Yamagishi 1994), involves the
development of perceived or reflected trustworthiness – the reasons why the trustee
(advisor) would behave in a trustworthy manner as perceived by the trustor (ownermanager) (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995; Nooteboom 2002). Perceived
trustworthiness is proposed to have three dimensions referred to as ability,
benevolence and integrity (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995). Ability is the
evaluation by the trustor that the trustee is capable of performing the actions that
will be relied upon. Benevolence is an evaluation of the trustee’s motivations, such
that the trustee has no ill will towards the trustor and that the trustee is genuinely
concerned about the trustor’s welfare. Integrity is the perception that the trustee is
honest and will deal fairly. In general, we would assume a certain degree of all of
these dimensions to be relevant in the choice of an advisor, while the comparative
weights are likely to vary with respect to the context of trust (Nooteboom 2002), for
example the type of problem for which advice is sought.
2.2. Advisor’s recent performance
The model of Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) proposes that the outcome of
trust in the relationship is a major influencer of the perceived trustworthiness for the

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

trustee. This means that the trustee’s performance at earlier points in time – whether
it has lived up to the trustor’s expectations – will influence the trustor’s perception of
their trustworthiness at a later point in time (Zolin et al. 2004). While the advisor’s
performance over time contributes to the development of the advisor-client
relationship and the level and nature of trust inherent in it, the following analysis
focuses on how the advisor’s recent performance impacts on their ability, integrity
and benevolence as perceived by the owner-manager. In particular, we examine the
effect of the owner-manager’s perception of how the advisor performed the last time
they were consulted.
The degree to which the performance of the advisor in an individual encounter
affects their trustworthiness probably depends on the degree of routinization in the
relationship; whether trusting is a conscious or habitual act. Nooteboom (2002)
argues that routine trust remains routine as long as the trustor does not notice
anything that would contradict its functionality. He further proposes that the
functionality of the routine has certain tolerance levels, which determine when the
trustee’s behaviour violates against the routine. When a tolerance level is violated,
the trustor consciously re-assesses the trustee’s trustworthiness. As a result, trust can
grow, diminish or it can even be withdrawn completely. In the case where trust is not
completely withdrawn, the trust routine and the tolerance levels accommodate
to the new evidence, and trust gradually becomes more and more routinized again.
Therefore, the degree of impact of the advisor’s recent performance is likely to
depend on whether her or his behaviour violated against an established routine or
whether the relationship or the situation in which advice was sought was novel so
that a functional routine had not yet been established.
While it is obvious that perceived performance has a direct effect on the
dimension of ability, it is also likely to affect benevolence and integrity. The advisor
is performing in a helping role; therefore the advisor’s performance should
further the goals of the business owner. If this happens then it is likely to be
interpreted as goal alignment and support for the business owner. Therefore,
superior perceived performance is likely to be positively associated with the
trustworthiness dimension of benevolence. Similarly, integrity is judged as congruence between words and actions (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995). Since the
advisor is likely to make some representation to the business owner about the
efficacy of the services offered, performance can also be seen as carrying through on
those promises and commitments. Hence, performance is also likely to be associated
with integrity. In summary, we propose that:
Hypothesis 1: The advisor’s recent performance is positively related to the ownermanager’s perception of the advisor’s ability, benevolence and integrity.

2.3. Strength of tie
Next, we consider the role of the strength of tie between the owner-manager and the
advisor in the formation of perceived trustworthiness. Following Granovetter (1973,
1361), strength of tie is defined as ‘a (probably linear) combination of the amount
of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding) and the reciprocal
services which characterize the tie’.
Given the generally lower level of resources and purchasing professionalism
in small firms (Boter and Lundström 2005; Morrissey and Pittaway 2004;

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

193

Smallbone, North, and Leigh 1993), they are not likely to follow the process
prescriptions of how to select providers of external expertise found in the literature
for managers in larger organizations (Fitzsimmons, Noh, and Thies 1998; Gallouj
1997; O’Farrell and Moffat 1991; Stock and Zinszer 1987). Instead, it is likely that
they more often use the short cut and acquire their external advice from a previously
known source without rigorously considering alternatives. Such a habit is, however,
not exclusive to small firms as previous research evidence implies (Johnston and
Bonoma 1981; O’Farrell and Moffat 1991).
Turning to a known provider is convenient and a degree of previous knowledge
of the advisor’s working habits, honesty and other personal characteristics is readily
available. Past experience is a key factor in choosing the source of external expertise
(Stock and Zinszer 1987), since familiarity facilitates predictability and reduces
the perceived level of risk (Johnston and Lewin 1996). Social networks can be crucial
to business relations (MacKinnon, Chapman, and Cumbers 2004). Furthermore,
with expert advice, the owner-managers face a problem of knowledge asymmetry
in that they may not be able to evaluate performance in an area of expertise
unknown to them. This in turn can lead to emphasis on subjective cues such as
likeability and interpersonal chemistry (Coulter and Coulter 2003; Day and
Barksdale 1992), which are more easily found in established relationships. All of
these features are associated with personal trust (Bachmann 2001; Barber 1983;
Gambetta 1988; McAllister 1995). In other words, a strong tie with the advisor
provides a foundation of trust. Considering that the stronger the tie, the more
information the owner-manager will have about the advisor’s ability, integrity and
benevolence, we expect a positive relationship between strength of tie and the three
dimensions of perceived trustworthiness. Hence:
Hypothesis 2a: The strength of tie between the owner-manager and the advisor
is positively related to the owner-manager’s perception of the advisor’s ability,
benevolence and integrity.
However, we propose that the story is not quite that simple but that the strength
of tie is actually a contextual variable that will have a moderating influence on the
links between the advisor’s recent performance and the dimensions of perceived
trustworthiness. Our reasoning is as follows. Trust in a long-term relationship
characterized by a strong tie is likely to be highly routine-based and such trust
is probably associated with broad tolerance levels (Nooteboom 2002). Thus, if the
trustee’s behaviour has been consistent so far, the trustor is more likely to give
the benefit of the doubt if a problem occurs (Kramer 1999) – or, in this case, if the
advisor’s recent performance has not lived up to the owner-manager’s expectations.
In other words, the owner-manager is more likely to allow larger deviations in the
advisor’s performance if a strong tie exists. Hence, strong ties could make
perceptions of trustworthiness more resistant to change, to both positive and
negative experiences with the performance of the advisor. As a result, we would
expect the advisor’s recent performance to have a more moderate impact on their
trustworthiness if a strong tie exists. Thus, we propose that:
Hypothesis 2b: An existing strong tie moderates the effect of the advisor’s recent
performance on their trustworthiness as perceived by the owner-manager so that the
stronger the tie, the lesser the impact of recent performance on perceived ability,
benevolence and integrity.

2.4. Professional versus informal advisors
Finally, we consider how the effects of an advisor’s recent performance and strength
of tie may differ depending on whether the advisor is a professional or an informal
advisor.
It seems fair to assume that professional advisors are, first and foremost,
performing a service that they get paid for, and are sought primarily because
of their competence. Thus, we postulate that recent performance is a more
important determinant of perceived ability in the case of professional than in
informal advisors. However, strength of tie is likely to moderate the impact of recent
performance on perceived ability. In the case of informal advisors, the familiarity
felt towards the friend or family member may filter through the strength of tie
leading to a more positive assessment of their ability, whether this be supported
by their recent performance or not. In the case of professional advisors, a wellknown advisor will have had the opportunity to prove their ability during the
time the strong tie has developed, thus making trust in the relationship highly
routine-based, potentially with relatively broad tolerance levels. Hence, the recent
performance of a well-known professional advisor weighs less than that of a less
well-known one. Given that ability as such is likely to be a lesser emphasis
in the choice of an informal advisor, we postulate that the moderating effect of
the strength of tie might actually be stronger in the context of professional
advisors, who are to a greater extent evaluated for their competence. Therefore,
we propose that:
Hypothesis 3a: The moderating impact of the strength of tie on the relationship
between the advisor’s recent performance and ability is stronger if the advisor is
a professional.
In contrast, besides convenience, entrepreneurs turn to family and friends not
because they think that these are the professionally most qualified people to advise,
but because they are expected to have, through the personal relationship, a genuine
interest in the help-seeker’s welfare. Benevolence requires time to develop and is thus
primarily a feature of long-term, close relationships (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
1995). Moreover, trust in somebody’s benevolence is likely to be robust across
different situations, while trust in the same person’s ability, for instance, is more
context-sensitive. For example, you might trust the advisor to do well in certain
situations and less well in others, but your trust in their goodwill is likely to remain
the same across a variety of advisory situations. Being robust and a feature of close
relationships, benevolence in strong ties is likely to have fairly broad tolerance levels.
Consequently, if a high level of trust in the advisor’s benevolence exists, the business
owner is likely to give them the benefit of the doubt, unless the advisor’s behaviour
notably violates the tolerance levels, for example through an obvious pursuit of selfinterest at the cost of the owner-manager’s best interests. Hence, generally, we would
expect the effect of the strength of tie to outweigh that of recent performance in how
benevolent the owner-manager perceives the advisor to be. However, we propose
that the moderating impact of the strength of tie on the relationship between an
advisor’s recent performance and benevolence is stronger in the case of an informal
advisor. The reason is that we would expect close personal relationships with friends
and family members to generate broader tolerance levels for benevolence than in the
case of professional advisors, such that even notable deviations from expected

<-----Page 7----->Entrepreneurship & Regional Development

195

performance may not cause the owner-manager to re-evaluate an informal advisor’s
benevolence. In summary:

Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

Hypothesis 3b: The moderating impact of the strength of tie on the relationship
between the advisor’s recent performance and benevolence is stronger with an
informal advisor.
In contrast to benevolence, the integrity of a friend or family member is likely to
be a less salient feature of the close, personal relationship with such an informal
advisor. The owner-manager may have a low evaluation of the integrity of the friend
or family member, but not worry about betrayal due to confidence in the
benevolence of the close tie. In fact, having an advisor who is at least willing to
consider ‘bending the rules’ (Sekerka and Zolin 2007) may be a motivation for
choosing an informal advisor. Hence, strength of tie is likely to outweigh recent
performance in the evaluation of an informal advisor’s integrity. Since many advisor
professions such as accountants, solicitors and government enterprise support
officers are (self-) regulated by rules, norms and professional ethics (Bennett and
Robson 1999) that generate institutional trust (Sztompka 1999; Welter and
Kautonen 2005; Zucker 1986), these are likely to play a role in the evaluation of
their integrity as well. Therefore we would assume that the relationship itself is
perhaps a less important determinant of integrity with professional than informal
advisors, because the professional’s integrity is also evaluated through perceived
conformance with the rules and norms governing their profession. Hence, we
propose that:
Hypothesis 3c: The moderating impact of the strength of tie on the relationship
between the advisor’s recent performance and integrity is stronger with an informal
advisor.

3. Methodology
3.1. Data
The following empirical analysis is based on data from a September 2007 survey
of new Finnish enterprises employing fewer than 50 people. Owner-managers were
asked to provide information about the person they most recently turned to when
they required external help, advice or support for their business. The sample was
drawn from the Business Register maintained by Statistics Finland, which is a
government agency that maintains and develops national official statistics. The
Business Register includes all Finnish businesses (including sole proprietors) that
are liable to pay value added tax, which is required of all businesses that generate an
annual turnover of 8500 Euros or more. The sampling frame included all businesses
that had registered in the period from 2000 to 2006, amounting to a total of 97,804
enterprises. A random cross-sectoral (excluding agriculture) sample was drawn and
1089 questionnaires were sent out by regular mail, which resulted in 153 usable
responses (response rate: 14%). Although missing values were few (five or less per
variable), they were estimated by means of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm in SPSS in order not to lose any cases in the final analysis. Applying
Harman’s post hoc one-factor test (Harman 1967; Podsakoff and Organ 1986) to the
model variables did not result in a strong first factor, which indicates that common

<-----Page 8----->196

method bias is not a limitation of our data, even though the dependent and
independent variables were collected at the same time with the same instrument.
A little over one-third (37.0%) of the sampled firms had been established in the
past two years, while the rest were more mature enterprises. Sole proprietors
comprise 40.0% of the total sample, while another 53.3% employ fewer than
10 people and are thus considered to be micro-enterprises according to the EU
classification (European Commission 2003). Thus, only a small minority of 6.7%
of the total sample employ between 10 and 49 people. This sample is typical of the
Finnish small business population (Statistics Finland 2005).

3.2. Measures
The scales for the three dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (ability, benevolence
and integrity) were adapted from Mayer and Davis (1999). Based on Granovetter’s
(1973, 1985) conceptualization, the strength of tie was operationalized as a threedimensional construct consisting of the depth of the relationship (how well the
person is known), the frequency of contact and the embeddedness of the tie in a
network of mutual friends and acquaintances. The scale for the advisor’s recent
performance as perceived by the owner-manager was adapted from a measure of
performance developed by Zaheer, McEvily, and Perrone (1998) and it measured
performance in terms of speed, creativity, appropriateness and cost the last time help,
support or advice was sought from this individual. All questionnaire items are
displayed in Appendix 1. Further, our questionnaire included a categorical variable
for the type of advisor whom the owner-manager had most recently turned to for
external expertise. We dichotomized this variable by grouping friends, family
members and former colleagues into informal advisors (n ¼ 67), and consultants,
solicitors, accountants and enterprise support officers into professional advisors
(n ¼ 86).

3.3. Analysis
The data were examined by means of the partial least squares (PLS) approach to
structural equation modelling (Chin 1998; Wold 1985) utilizing SmartPLS 2.0
(Ringle, Wende, and Will 2005). While covariance-based methods of structural
equation modelling (e.g. LISREL or AMOS) are more widespread, we decided in
favour of the PLS approach due to its non-parametric nature which makes it suitable
for analysing relatively small datasets with non-normally distributed variables
(Chin 1998). The data analysis process involved two main steps. First, we tested a
direct effects model (excluding the moderating effect of strength of tie) and an
interaction model (including the moderating effect) on the whole sample. The
purpose of this approach was to test whether adding the interaction term (advisor’s
recent performance multiplied by strength of tie) improves the explanatory power of
the model. Second, exploratory group comparisons (Chin 2000) were conducted by
running the analysis for a number of different subsamples. This procedure was
employed not only to examine the differences between professional and informal
advisors, but also to control for the potential effects of the maturity of the firm,
previous management experience and previous entrepreneurial experience.

4. Data analysis and results
4.1. Assessment of measurement models
The models consist of five reflective constructs: advisor’s recent performance,
strength of tie and the three perceived trustworthiness constructs of benevolence,
ability and integrity. For all of these constructs, all item measures show loadings
of more than 0.7 in the complete sample so that no item measure had to be deleted
(Chin 1998). Construct reliability was assessed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha (),
composite reliability and average variance extracted (AVE). Table 1 displays these
scores together with the constructs’ means and standard deviations. All constructs
show satisfying levels that are in keeping with the usual threshold values of 0.7 for
Cronbach’s  and composite reliability and 0.5 for AVE (Chin 1998; Nunnally 1978).
On average, survey participants report having consulted an advisor with whom they
have a comparatively strong tie (mean score: 5.03 on a 7-point Likert scale) and
whom they perceived to have performed quite well (5.87) the last time the advisor
was consulted. The perceived trustworthiness scores range from 4.83 for benevolence
to 5.94 for ability, with the integrity mean score of 5.33 approximately in the middle
of the range.
Discriminant validity was assessed both at the item level and at the construct
level. With respect to item discriminant validity, an inspection of indicator crossloadings reveals that all indicators are loading at their highest with their respective
construct and that no indicator loads higher on other constructs than on its intended
construct. It is therefore safe to assume item discriminant validity. At the construct
level, the comparison of the square root of each reflective construct’s AVE (Table 1)
and the latent variable correlations (Table 2) (Chin 1998) suggests that there is
satisfactory discriminant validity (Cool, Dierickx, and Jemison 1989).
4.2. Assessment of structural models
The path-weighting scheme (Chin 1998; Lohmöller 1989) was chosen to estimate
paths between the variables. In order to determine the significance of each estimated
path, a standard bootstrapping procedure (Yung and Bentler 1996) was applied with
500 re-samples consisting of the same number of cases as in the original sample. The
same process was followed for the direct effects model as well as the interaction
effects model (Chin, Marcolin, and Newsted 2003). Table 3 displays the results of the
PLS estimation for the direct effects model (Model 1) and the interaction model
(Model 2).

Both models explain a satisfying amount of variance in the endogenous variables
with R2 values ranging from 0.404 to 0.602. This indicates a medium to high
explanatory power for the model. Moreover, the Stone-Geisser-Criterion points
towards the interpretation that both models are of satisfying predictive relevance,
given that the Q2 values for all three endogenous variables are clearly above zero
in both models. Calculating the models’ goodness of fit (GoF) scores (Tenenhaus
et al. 2005) results in a satisfying value (Ringle, Wende, and Will 2009) of 0.579 for
the direct effects model and 0.588 for the interaction model. All in all, the interaction
effects model seems to fit the data slightly better than the direct effects model, given
its higher R2 and GoF values.

4.3. Results
With respect to the direct effects model (Model 1 in Table 3), we find significant
positive paths for all relationships. The effect sizes f 2 vary from a weak positive effect
of the strength of tie (SOT) on perceived ability (ABTY) to strong positive effects

of the advisor’s recent performance (PERF) on ABTY and benevolence (BENE).
All other relationships are associated with medium-level effects. These results
support our theoretical reasoning summarized in Hypotheses 1 and 2a: both the
advisor’s recent performance and the strength of tie between the owner-manager and
the advisor have a positive effect on all dimensions of perceived trustworthiness.
Introducing the interaction term clearly improves the model’s explanatory power
and predictive relevance (Model 2 in Table 3). All direct effects stay significant as
in the direct effects model, while the effect sizes and R2 values slightly increase.
The interaction term SOT*PERF turns out to negatively impact the relationship
between PERF and ABTY and the relationship between PERF and integrity (INT),
while it is not significant for the relationship between PERF and BENE. This means,
for instance, that one standard deviation increase in the level of SOT will reduce
the path coefficient of PERF to ABTY by 0.137. We plotted the significant
interaction effects as suggested in Mitchell, Mitchell, and Smith (2008) to aid in the
interpretation of the moderator test results. Figure 2 shows that the advisor’s recent
performance impacts on their perceived ability less if the owner-manager knows
the advisor very well (high SOT). This finding supports Hypothesis 2b for ability.
Moreover, Figure 2 shows that recent performance has a moderate effect on
perceived integrity disregarding SOT. On the other hand, if the advisor is very well
known (high SOT), the owner-manager always perceives them to have higher
integrity than an advisor who is not well known, disregarding their recent
performance. However, since a mere shift of the curve does not change the direction
of the relationship as such, Hypothesis 2b is not supported for integrity. In summary,
we find support for Hypothesis 2b only for ability but not for integrity or
benevolence.
In addition to examining differences in the model results if the owner-manager
consulted a professional or an informal advisor, we controlled the model findings
for the potential effects of the maturity of the firm, previous management experience
and previous entrepreneurial experience. For all these analyses we calculated
explorative group comparisons employing the interaction effects model. We followed
recommendations set forth by Chin (2000) and estimated separate models for young
versus mature firms, experienced versus inexperienced entrepreneurs (with respect
to previous managerial and entrepreneurial experience), and entrepreneurs who

<-----Page 12----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

T. Kautonen et al.

consulted informal advisors versus those who consulted professional advisors.
Neither the maturity of the firm nor either type of previous experience resulted
in differences worth reporting. However, the comparison of the informal advisor
subsample (Model 3) and the professional advisor subsample (Model 4) revealed
some interesting differences in the moderating effect of SOT. Table 4 gives the results
of this group comparison.
Models 3 and 4 are of sufficient explanatory power, predictive relevance and
overall fit as indicated by their respective R2, Q2 and GoF values. Similarly, the
reliability and validity measures for the two models are of comparable quality to the
results of the main model. There are no significant differences detectable in terms
of how the independent variables influence their respective dependent variables
directly, but the effects of the interaction term SOT*PERF differ significantly
between professional and informal advisors.
While SOT moderates the relationship between PERF and ABTY in the
professional advisor subsample negatively and significantly, the moderation effect
is non-significant in the informal advisor subsample. This finding supports
Hypothesis 3a. Equally, while SOT moderates the relationship between PERF and
BENE in the informal advisor subsample positively and significantly, the moderation effect in the professional advisor subsample is non-significant. This supports
Hypothesis 3b. The relationship between PERF and INT shows a similar difference
in the moderation effect, but the difference is not statistically significant. This finding
does not support Hypothesis 3c.

Figure 3. Significant interaction effects from the professional (n ¼ 86) and the informal
advisor subsamples (n ¼ 67).

Hence, it is the two statistically significant differences that warrant particular
attention. The corresponding interaction plots are depicted in Figure 3. The plot
for ability in the professional advisor subsample is similar to the same plot in the
combined sample (Figure 2). That is, the better the owner-manager knows the
professional advisor, the less her or his perception of the advisor’s ability is affected
by the advisor’s recent performance. The moderating effect of SOT on BENE for
informal advisors indicates that the better the owner-manager knows the informal
advisor (high SOT), the more his or her perception of this person’s benevolence
is affected by their recent performance, while recent performance does not impact on
benevolence if the advisor is not well known (low SOT).

5. Discussion
The empirical results support our prediction as to the direct effects of an advisor’s
recent performance on each dimension of perceived trustworthiness. As one would
expect, we found that the better the owner-manager rated the advisor’s recent
performance, the higher he or she held the advisor’s perceived trustworthiness.
It is not surprising that recent performance increases the perception of ability,
but why would it also increase benevolence and integrity? Probably because
benevolence is the perception that the advisor has the owner-manager’s interests at
heart and good performance contributes to the understanding that the advisor
supports the owner-manager’s goals and interests. Similarly, integrity is built upon
follow-through of what has been promised and good performance acts as evidence
that the advisor indeed does what they say they will do. Also the strength of the
personal relationship was found to influence all dimensions of perceived trustworthiness positively. This is not surprising, given that the trust inherent in a strong tie is
likely to be an important criterion in the choice of such an advisor.
However, the focus of our interest concerned the moderating effect of the
strength of tie on the relationships between the advisor’s recent performance and the
three dimensions of perceived trustworthiness. Could a strong tie become a ‘tie that
blinds’ the owner-manager to the advisor’s potentially sub-standard performance?
The interaction between strength of tie and integrity showed that close personal
contacts, whether professional or informal advisors, are considered to have higher
integrity than weak ties, whether recent performance is high or low. While this result
does not support our moderating hypothesis as such, it nevertheless has implications
to our research question. Granted, regardless of whether the tie is strong or weak,
advisors with better performance are perceived to have higher integrity than advisors
with lower performance. However, the level of integrity given to strong ties is
considerably higher at all levels of performance. Therefore, a strong tie can become
a ‘tie that blinds’ in assessing an advisor’s integrity. An alternative interpretation
is that integrity is a salient feature of close personal relationships, and therefore is
subject to fairly broad tolerance levels. As such, recent performance only impacts on
a business owner’s assessment of the advisor’s integrity when it deviates substantially
from the expected standard, that is, breaches the broad tolerance level for routinebased trust in the advisor’s integrity.
The results support our hypothesizing with regard to strength of tie negatively
moderating the impact of recent performance on the business owner’s evaluation of
the advisor’s ability. Although this was found for the full sample, when the results
were calculated for professional and informal advisors, the result only held for
professional advisors. This indicates that when there is low performance, a strong tie
with the professional advisor results in a higher perception of ability than when there
is a weak tie. This difference disappears when the professional advisor has high
performance, regardless of the strength of tie.
Therefore, a strong tie can be a ‘tie that blinds’ when assessing a professional
advisor’s ability, because the assessment of recent performance appears to have less
impact on perceived ability if the advisor is well known. What explains the effect of
strength of tie? This looks like giving the strong tie professional advisor with weak
performance a great ‘benefit of the doubt’. A strong-tie professional advisor has
had multiple opportunities to prove their competence, which could allow the ownermanager’s trust in their ability to become routine and an intrinsic quality of the

<-----Page 15----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

Entrepreneurship & Regional Development

203

relationship itself, rather than something that is constantly monitored and assessed.
Moreover, the tolerance levels for this trust could be (subconsciously) adjusted
so that minor deviations in the advisor’s recent performance do not affect the
perception of their ability. Why does the strength of tie have a significant effect on
ability only in the case of professional advisors? A probable explanation is that
ability as such is a lesser concern with informal advisors, who are more likely to be
engaged because they are expected to have a genuine interest in the owner-manager’s
welfare (benevolence), rather than due to their professional competence.
The analysis further revealed that the strength of tie positively moderates the
impact of the advisor’s recent performance on benevolence in the case of informal
advisors, while the moderation effect is non-significant with professional advisors.
Like the relationship we found with integrity, in the case of informal advisors
benevolence is higher for strong ties whether recent performance is high or low.
In addition, in the case of informal advisors, the strength of tie actually enhances
the impact of recent good performance on perceived benevolence: the stronger the
relationship, the more positively recent performance adds to the owner-manager’s
evaluation of the advisor’s benevolence.
Considering that benevolence is the perception that the advisor has the ownermanager’s interests at heart, high perceived benevolence is probably one of the main
reasons for engaging a well-known informal advisor, while professional advisors are
primarily sought for their specific competence. Maybe a foundation of benevolence
inherent in the relationship is required for the owner-manager to interpret good
performance as benevolent behaviour, rather than merely fulfilling a professional
duty without an extra ‘personal touch’. The type of advice and the context in which
it is sought may also play a role in this context. Friends and family members are
perhaps more likely to be engaged to help in matters of judgement, such as discussing
product ideas, marketing concepts and recruitment decisions, rather than to advise
on accounting, legal or other similar technical issues. Advice on technical issues
is less likely to contribute to benevolence, whereas good performance in a matter
of judgement, such as supporting the business owner with a new product idea, may
be more easily interpreted as benevolent behaviour. In other words, we propose that
future studies should examine these contextual factors in order to shed more light
into whether it is the strong-tie informal advisors per se, or the type of help and
support sought from them, that causes the positive moderating effect of the strength
of tie on the relationship between recent performance and benevolence.

6. Managerial implications
The most important finding of this study from the perspective of business owners
is that, despite the many benefits of long-term advisory relationships, ‘ties can blind’
when owner-managers evaluate the extent of their professional advisors’ ability.
Therefore, the need for regular performance reviews on well-known professional
advisors should not be dismissed. Also, while formal selection processes (Day and
Barksdale 1994; Fitzsimmons, Noh, and Thies 1998) may seem cumbersome to small
firms with limited resources, careful consideration in the choice of professional
advisors in particular is essential. While trust is a necessary prerequisite for a
successful advisory relationship, it is but one aspect to consider in the choice of an
advisor.

<-----Page 16----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

T. Kautonen et al.

From the perspective of professional advisors, in both private and public sectors
(Mole and Keogh 2009), we recommend them to assist their clients in making clear
judgements based upon the quality of their work and their expertise, rather than the
strength of their relationship as such. Such behaviour by professional advisors would
benefit both the good of the client and the reputation of the advisor, especially in the
long run. Lack of critical questioning by the client could result in some advice acted
upon while not being fully understood. In particular, professional advisors should
be careful to limit their involvement if owner-managers, prompted by the trust
established through a strong tie, request advice on an issue beyond the advisor’s true
area of expertise. In such a case referring the client to a more qualified advisor is,
again in the long run, more likely to contribute to further development of trust in
the relationship.
From the perspective of friends and family members who provide informal
advice, help and support to business owners, we encourage these individuals to be
aware that they are likely to be endowed by the business owner with high degrees
of benevolence, upon which the business owner relies. For example, informal
advisors could be given access to highly sensitive market information or be asked
to advise in areas outside their expertise. If such trust is not desired, the informal
advisor should be clear about boundaries and attempt to establish shared
understandings of the goals and performance criteria for their interactions with
business owners. Granted these measures may be highly subjective, but they could
avoid embarrassing or expensive misunderstandings.

7. Limitations and further research
Like all research, this study is not without some notable limitations. An important
practical limitation is that we cannot link perceived trustworthiness with the actual
choice of advisor. That is, we cannot say to what extent the advisor’s perceived
ability, benevolence and integrity affect the choice of this particular advisor
compared to other factors, such as convenience. Therefore, we cannot draw a causal
link from our finding that the strength of tie moderates the impact of actual
performance on the development of the advisor’s trustworthiness, to whether this
effect actually translates into a ‘tie that blinds’ that results in the acquisition of
suboptimal external expertise. In order to do that, we would need to examine the
impact of the choice of advisor on the firm’s performance and development. For
some businesses, it may not matter if they do not get the most rigorous or technically
advanced advice, provided the advice is competent and addresses the business’s
needs, especially if the business is lifestyle-oriented rather than growth-oriented.
Given the broad cross-sectoral sampling of the present study, most of the
respondents own very small firms and are not likely to be very growth-oriented.
An implication of this discussion for further research is to examine the ‘ties
that blind’ hypothesis in a context where the choice of advisors is likely to make a
substantial difference, for instance in the high-tech industries where an above
average share of start-ups are growth-oriented.
Furthermore, it would be important to integrate the context of placing trust
(Nooteboom 2002) into further studies. In our current treatise we could not
distinguish between different situations in which help and advice is sought. This is
likely to play an important role in the development of trust: if the advice sought is

<-----Page 17----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:03 18 April 2010

Entrepreneurship & Regional Development

205

of a technical nature, such as bookkeeping, this is unlikely to have a major impact
on benevolence. Similarly, if the owner-manager seeks help to discuss her or his
work-related stress, benevolence is likely to be the target dimension of trust together
with integrity, and ability might be a secondary concern.
A methodological limitation of the study is its cross-sectional quantitative nature.
This mainly refers to the limited dynamic orientation in researching the (changing)
process nature of trust and the reasons for trusting, both of which can be examined
only to a limited degree within a standardized cross-sectional survey. The study of
trust in the context of owner-manager-advisor relationships, and trust research
more generally, would greatly benefit from studies that adopt an evolutionary
perspective and address the process of how trust emerges, develops and possibly
diminishes over the course of multiple encounters between the trustor (ownermanager) and the trustee (advisor) (Jack, Drakopoulou Dodd, and Anderson 2008).
Here, longitudinal research designs are required and qualitative approaches could
provide a useful complement to surveys. Qualitative approaches would also have the
additional advantage of providing rich, contextual data, which would enable
researchers to integrate the context of trust into their analyses. Also, international
comparisons could indicate potential differences in the effects of strong ties due to
differences in national or ethnic culture (Garcı́a-Cabrera and Garcı́a-Soto 2008).

8. Conclusions
This research contributed to our understanding of the working relationship between
business owners and their advisors by explaining how, in the context of the
relationship, the advisor’s recent performance influences the owner-manager’s
perceptions of their trustworthiness. In particular, the study illustrated how the
strength of tie moderates the relationship between recent performance and the three
dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (ability, benevolence and integrity). The
results show that strong ties increase the owner-manager’s perception of the advisor’s
integrity, disregarding how the owner-manager has evaluated their recent
performance. For professional advisors, strong ties reduce the impact of recent
performance in the owner-manager’s evaluation of their ability. For informal
advisors, a strong tie makes it more likely that their benevolence will be evaluated
highly in light of their recent performance.
Can a strong tie be a ‘tie that blinds’? Our results indicate that, in principle,
it can. Business owners seem to overlook low performance when evaluating the
ability of strong-tie professional advisors and they confer higher integrity on any
well-known advisor, disregarding how they have evaluated the advisor’s recent
performance. However, we cannot say to what degree this has actual ill-effects, or in
the case where there are ill-effects, whether these exceed the many benefits of longterm advisory relationships. For example, even if a strong tie does reduce the impact
of recent performance in the evaluation of a professional advisor’s ability, this does
not necessarily mean that the owner-manager makes a suboptimal choice. It may
well be that the advisor does meet the firm’s requirements if not perfectly, then at
least ‘satisficingly’ (Simon 1957). Nevertheless, we urge owner-managers, particularly those seeking growth for their business, not to dismiss concrete performance
indicators even when using an advisor with whom strong ties have been formed.
We also encourage advisors to ensure that their advice is critically evaluated

<-----Page 18----->206

and understood, particularly by well-known clients, so as to facilitate the
development of well-founded trust-based long-term relationships. Further research
is required to examine the causal link between the choice of advisor and the
performance and development of the firm. This will help us to understand when
the moderating impact of a strong tie is disadvantageous for the business.
