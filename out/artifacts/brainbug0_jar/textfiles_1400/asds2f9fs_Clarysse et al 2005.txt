This study examines the selection behaviour of 68 European early stage high tech VCs.
In particular, we examine whether or not these VCs exhibit heterogeneity in their
selection behaviour. To examine these issues we employ a conjoint analysis
methodology. Our results indicate that VCs exhibit substantial heterogeneity in
investment selection behaviour. Employing a cluster analysis three types of investors
emerge: those who focus on technology, those who focus on finance and those who focus
on people. We then examine the drivers of these differences, being the sectoral focus, the
sources of funds and the human capital of the investment manager.

SELECT THEIR INVESTMENTS?
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Quite a lot of researchers have studied selection criteria used by venture
capitalists when assessing a business proposal. Most of these studies were undertaken
with US venture capitalists and used post hoc methodology or verbal protocol analysis. In
this research, we build upon the positive aspects of these methodologies, but use a
conjoint analysis instead, allowing us to both capture the hierarchy of selection criteria
used by VCs and the reasoning of the investment manager during the selection process.
We focus on a specific subset of the European venture capital industry, namely
those VCs investing in early stage high tech projects. Next to studying selection
behaviour of these VCs, we look at what drives this selection behaviour. We specifically
look at whether the sources of funds, the human capital of the investment manager and
the sector in which the business proposal is situated are determinants of VCs’ selection
behaviour.
Our results indicate that VCs exhibit substantial heterogeneity in investment
selection behaviour. Employing a cluster analysis three clear types of investors emerge:
those who focus on technology, those who focus on finance and those who focus on
people. We then examine differences between the three groups in terms of their sectoral
focus, the sources of the funds and the human capital of the investment manager. The
results indicate that technology investors make most use of public money and invest in
biotech. These investment managers sometimes have an academic background. Finance
investors make the least use of public capital, invest in ICT and their investment
managers are the least experienced. People investors are most often found in the other
sectors and the investment managers combine experience within other VC funds and have
a business education.
The results of this study have important implications for practitioners. Our results
show that the background and experience of investment managers can influence the
individual’s selection behaviour. VCs may build their investment teams with a human
capital consideration in mind. Next to this, it is interesting to VCs to know which VCs

3

<-----Page 3----->have similar selection patterns and thus to know which VCs they will be competing with
on specific deals, or could be potential syndication partners.
Similarly, high tech entrepreneurs can benefit from a better knowledge of
selection behaviour. What makes this research particularly interesting to them is that it
focuses on a subset of the European VC industry and focuses on those investors they will
call upon when looking for finance for their early stage high tech projects. In addition,
entrepreneurs can benefit from a better knowledge of what drives selection behaviour,
and thus approach those investors that are more likely to invest in their investment
proposal. It is particularly interesting to the entrepreneur to see that selection behaviour
differs between funds and that not all venture capitalists are putting the same criteria on
top of their list. Next to this, it is interesting to the entrepreneur to understand how fund
characteristics, the background of the investment manager that is in front of him/her, and
the sector the investment proposal is in, will determine the VC’s selection behaviour.
Finally, knowledge on differences in selection behaviour is interesting to fund
investors, and more specifically to investors of public money. The results indicate that
public money is used for investing in business proposals with a strong technological
basis. This may be viewed as an attempt to overcome problems associated with perceived
market failures, that exist for early stage high tech funding.
INTRODUCTION
The issues as to how venture capitalists select which proposals to invest in has
been a major topic of research over the past two decades. Previous research has identified
a number of important criteria on which venture capital firms base their decision to
invest. First, the “human capital” of entrepreneurial teams was found to be an important
decision factor. Human capital includes: (a) the ability of management, whether it is
management skill, quality of management, characteristics of the management team or the
management track record (Shepherd and Zacharakis (1999)); (b) the management skills
of the entrepreneur (Tyebjee & Bruno (1984); MacMillan et al. (1985; 1987)); and (c) the
heterogeneity of the entrepreneurial team (Keeley and Roure (1989)). A second stream of
research identified the market environment in which the venture starts up as one of the
major decision factors. This environment includes the characteristics of the

4

<-----Page 4----->market/industry (Hisrich and Jankowitz (1990)), environmental threats to the business
(Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), Meyer et al (1993)), the level of competition (Hutt and
Thomas (1985), Kahn (1987), Muzyka et al (1996)) and the degree of product
differentiation (Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), Hutt and Thomas (1985), Kahn (1987),
Hisrich and Jankowitz (1990)). Other factors which have been found to be important
criteria used by venture capitalists to evaluate venture proposals are: financial criteria and
exit opportunities (Macmillan et al. (1987)) and the product/service characteristics
(Macmillan et al (1987); Muzyka (1987)).
Virtually all of the above mentioned studies have been undertaken with US-based
venture capitalists. Furthermore, Muzyka et al (1996) emphasize that these studies were
exploratory in terms of their data collection techniques and assume a single hierarchy of
decision criteria. To overcome these limitations Muzyka et al (1996) explored trade offs
in decision criteria among European Venture Capitalists. They found three groups of VCs
in Europe: those primarily concerned with investing nationally, those who focus solely
upon the deal, and mainstream investors who consistently, and instinctively, rank
management team criteria as their primary criteria. The Muzyka et al (1996) study was a
first attempt to synthesize and hierarchically classify to selection criteria found by the
first wave of VC studies. The results, however, were rather meagre, having one cluster
with only four VCs and a very large one where – consistent with the previous studies –
the “human factor” is the utmost important one.
Since the Muzyka study in the mid-nineties, the venture capital industry in Europe
has grown significantly. In parallel, VC scholars have emphasized that the VC industry is
fragmented into different segments. A number of studies have found that early stage VCs
differ from late stage VCs (e.g. Elango (1995); Sapienza et al (1994)); and that high tech
and non-high tech VCs differ (Lockett, Murray and Wright (2002); Murray and Lott
(1996); Baum and Silverman (2003)). Therefore, the fact that, to date research on
investment selection behaviour of VCs has only focused on the venture capital industry
as a whole may be problematic. In this paper we start from the premise that high tech
investing is different from non-high tech investing (Lockett et all (2002), and focus only
on those venture capitalists for whom investing in high tech is core business. High tech

5

<-----Page 5----->investors play a key role in funding high tech companies that can accomplish this
technological renewal, and thus create economic growth.
This study departs from the idea that not all venture capitalists use the same
hierarchy of decision criteria for selecting investment proposals. In particular, we address
two main research questions:
RQ1: Do early stage high tech venture capitalists differ in their investment
selection behaviour?
RQ2: What drives the differences in behaviour across early stage high tech
venture capitalists?
Consistent with Muzyka et al (1996), we test this idea by investigating the trade
offs made by early stage high tech venture capitalists, across Europe, at the moment they
take the decision as to whether or not to further investigate an initial proposal. By
focusing only on the population of early stage high tech venture capital firms in Europe
we are able to generate a degree of homogeneity in terms of the VC firms we investigate.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we outline the theoretical background
and develop hypotheses. Second, we outline the method used, focusing on the use of
conjoint analysis. Third, we present a cluster analysis of the venture capital firms
according to their investment selection behaviour and then link the cluster results with the
characteristics of the funds. Finally, we draw conclusions from our results.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The heterogeneity of VC investment behaviour
As outlined above, many studies have examined the selection criteria of venture
capitalists. The early studies in the 1980s to mid 1990s found that for the average venture
capitalist the “human factor” is the most important criterion. This human factor can be
found in the entrepreneurial experience, the management skills and the business
experience, which are allocated to the founding team (see: Hall and Hofer (1993) for a
review of these early studies). Sandberg et al (1988) suggest a contingent relationship
among the criteria used by VCs. As with most studies at that time, they argue that deals
are selected based upon the human resource criteria in combination with the

6

<-----Page 6----->characteristics of the industry, the proposed strategy or business model and the structure
of the deal.
Although these early studies revealed interesting and useful insights, they were
criticized for using simple methodologies in assessing the evaluation criteria. In short, the
most common approach was a post hoc methodology which consisted effectively of
asking why investment managers had invested in certain business proposals. This
method, however, is problematic as it can potentially generate biased results because
people are poor at introspection (Shepherd and Zacharakis (1998)), are often motivated to
bias results in a post hoc rationalisation (March and Feldman (1981)), and have limited
capacity to recall what has happened (Fischhoff (1982)). As a reaction on these post hoc
methods, researchers started to experiment with real time methods such as verbal
protocol analysis. For example, Hall and Hofer (1993) presented four venture capitalists
six protocols for assessment. They found that VCs screen and assess business proposals
very rapidly which makes it unlikely that they can persistently evaluate their decisions
post hoc. Also, key criteria used by the VCs are related to the financial and economic
conditions of the business plan such as long term growth and profitability. Surprisingly
they found a lack of importance placed on the entrepreneur or his/her team. To date, this
is the only study which has found financial criteria to be of utmost importance.
In a further development, the subjectivity of analysis and interpretation involved
in verbal protocol techniques, without being supplemented with other techniques such as
computer algorithms, has been questioned by Riquelme and Rickards (1992). They argue
that verbal protocol analysis is more an art than a science; suggesting instead the use of
conjoint analysis as a technique for the analysis of VCs’ decision making. Conjoint
analysis is not new, it is a general term referring to a technique that requires respondents
to make a series of judgements, based on profiles, from which their ‘captured’ decision
processes can be decomposed into its underlying structure.

A profile is simply a

combination of all the attributes where each attribute is described by one of its levels. It
has been used in other fields of research, especially in marketing.
Muzyka et al (1996), followed Riquelme and Rickards’ (1992) pioneering work,
to use conjoint analysis in assessing the decision criteria used by VCs. In a more
sophisticated analysis, they analysed the key criteria used by European VCs in evaluating

7

<-----Page 7----->potential investments characterized by 53 profiles (each profile required the respondent to
make a trade-off between a pair of independent criteria). To determine which attributes
were to be included in the conjoint analysis, open-ended interviews with VCs were
carried out. The venture capitalists made 53 pair wise trade-offs with multiple levels.
They found that among the first seven, five management team criteria were ranked and
product-market criteria appeared to be moderately important; fund and deal criteria were
at the bottom of the rankings. Over 75 percent of the venture capitalists in their study
conformed to this profile. Zacharakis and Meyer (2000) refined this use of conjoint
analysis to let venture capitalists invest in 50 ventures in an experimental setting. They
found that team factors were much less high in the hierarchy of importance, and a
significant group of VCs ranked market and competition variables as being the most
important.
To summarize, the above studies have identified three groups of venture
capitalists. One group, which is called by Muzyka et al. (1996), the mainstream venture
capitalist, focuses on human resources, followed by product market and financial criteria
such as exit possibilities. A second group, identified by researchers using real life
protocols, are investors which place most importance on the financial aspects of the
business plan such as growth, time to break-even and profitability. Finally, a new stream
of research using conjoint analysis seems to recognize a group which is much more
concerned about the product market characteristics of the business plan than of the
management and entrepreneurial team criteria.
As outlined above, previous research has shown that the venture capital industry
is not homogeneous in its investment focus. Lockett et al (2002) found that, as with the
Murray and Lott study (1995), a bias remained against VC firms’ involvement in the
earliest stages of the technology investment cycle. We have reason, therefore, to believe
that the high tech VC industry is a distinct market in itself and that firms may behave
differently from their non-tech counterparts. It is for this reason that our research only
focuses on those venture capitalists investing in early stage high tech proposals. Our point
of departure is that early stage high tech investors will exhibit heterogeneity in terms of
their investment selection behaviour. In the next section we examine what may drive
these differences in behaviour.

8

<-----Page 8----->What drives differences in investment selection behaviour?
The investment decision of the investment manager with respect to a specific project may
be a determinant of 1) the investment strategy of the VC and 2) the result of a screening
of the potential deal. This research focuses on the screening of the potential deal, but does
take into account that the overall investment strategy of the fund may impact the
individual’s appraisal of a potential project.
An important influence on VC investment selection behaviour may be the source
of funds the VC has to invest. The source of funds may affect investment strategy of the
fund, which may in turn affect the investment decision on specific deals. Hellman (2002)
develops a theory on strategic investment, indicating that private equity arms of banks
seek complementarities between their venture capital and lending activities. Therefore, it
seems natural that they will base their investment decision on other criteria than nonstrategic investors. The same goes for public funds. Investment managers investing funds
from public initiatives may have other objectives rather than purely financial ones
(Manigart et al, 2002). For instance, they may be focusing more on the capacity of
technological breakthrough and renewal of a project, as this may influence economic
growth.
Mayer et al (2005) find that venture capitalists invest in different types of
business proposals according to their own sources of funds. For instance, bank and
pension fund backed VC firms are inclined towards late stage investments in low tech
domestic sectors whereas government backed VC funds invest in early stage domestic
high tech sectors. Although this study does not specifically look at the investment criteria
used, it indicates that the institutional structure has an important effect on the decisions
which are made by the investment manager. In other words, it suggests that the
investment criteria are indeed different.
This leads us to the following proposition:
P1: The source of funds of European high tech early stage venture capitalists will
have a significant effect on the selection criteria used by these VCs

9

<-----Page 9----->A second factor that may be important in terms of accounting for differences in
the investment selection behaviour of VC firms is the human capital of its investment
managers, and more specifically their experience (Shepherd et al (2002)). Shepherd et al
(2002) examined whether more specific experience in the venture capital industry
resulted in better decisions.

The results show that experience is beneficial to VC

decision-making, but only up to a point (14 years of experience). In their model, age,
stage of investment and technology were each individually added as a control variable
and the results did not significantly change and none of these control variables were
significant.
Also in our sample of early stage high tech investors it seems plausible that the
emphasis investment managers put on certain criteria may change according to their
experience. An investment manager, who has experienced the difficulties associated with
the replacement of the portfolio company’s CEO, may be more likely to stress human
factors when selecting new projects. Or this experienced investment manager may stress
the ability to protect the product that the portfolio company commercialises, as he/she
learnt that this protection gives the possibility to reform the management team or change
the company’s strategy, without losing value to competitors. It may even be that the most
experienced investment managers attach little importance to financial forecasts in the
business plan, as they often prove to be unreliable, and far away from reality.
This leads us to the following proposition:
P2: The background and experience of the investment manager will have a
significant effect on the selection criteria
A third factor may be the business sector of the investment proposal. Many scholars
study high tech start-ups in particular environments such as biotechnology (Stuart et al
(1999), Baum and Silverman (2003)), computers (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995)) and
software and dot-coms (Amit and Zott (2001)). The underlying rationale for studying
companies in a specific environment is that the technological regime influences to a large
extent the business model a start-up can follow. Therefore, some researchers study VCs
investing in specific technologies only (e.g. Baum and Silverman (2003) focus on biotech

10

<-----Page 10----->investing). Baum and Silverman (2003) indicate that there are three broad types of
signals that may affect VCs’ assessments of start-ups in biotech: alliance capital,
intellectual capital and human capital. So, even though early stage high tech investors
may be a quite homogeneous subset of the VC industry, we still believe differences may
occur with respect to the sectors of investment. VCs investing in biotechnology projects
may stress the protectability of the technology, while this is much less the case in ICT,
where software is hard to protect. Having a team with strong commercial skills and a
good network may matter more in ICT businesses where knowledge is hard to protect and
time to market is crucial. Next to this, biotech companies looking for early stage finance
hardly ever have a product that is already accepted by the market. We may then assume
that market acceptance will be of little importance to biotech investors. This discussion
leads to the following proposition.
P3: the sector in which the business proposal is situated will have a significant
effect on the importance of selection criteria
METHOD
As outlined above, most of the studies into VCs’ decision making have relied on
post-hoc methods of data collection. These methods include the use of questionnaires,
surveys and interviews to collect data on the VCs’ decision policy. Sandberg et al
(1988), Hall and Hofer (1993) and Zacharakis and Meyer (1995) attempt to overcome
these problems by using verbal protocols. Verbal protocol analysis has the advantage of
being real time experiments where VCs ‘think aloud’ while a business plan is being
screened. The problem with these real time studies is that it is difficult to analyse the
data in a consistent way and sophisticated computer algorithms are needed to detect
patterns. In this study, we build upon the positive aspects of both the post hoc and the real
time studies. Post hoc studies have the advantage of measuring complex issues in an easy
to analyse way. Real time studies have the advantage of observing the decisions at the
moment they are made.
Instead, we presented the venture capitalists with a number of fictive business
cases that differ on attributes. These attributes were selected in two steps. First, we

11

<-----Page 11----->constructed a synthesis of the criteria that had been used in previous research.

In

addition, we drew on the insights of two VCs, one business angel investing in early stage
high tech and three VC experts in order to draw a list of criteria that were important to
them. We deemed this a necessary process given that no research had been conducted
with high tech investors exclusively. Finally we synthesised the two lists into a set of
criteria that we then pre-tested with the experts, which they accepted as being the criteria
they judged on when screening a business plan in reality. From this process we ended up
with four main categories of selection criteria: team, market, product and finance. In
total, twelve different attributes were included: team, entrepreneur, contact with the
entrepreneur, uniqueness of the product, protection of the product, market acceptance,
platform technology, location, size and growth of the targeted market, time to break-even
and return on investment.
In line with the conjoint analysis philosophy, and consistent with Muzyka et al.
(1996), potential events were matched to the different attributes (see table 1). Thirty
levels (or events) were developed conceptually based upon the twelve attributes. For
instance, team complementarity and experience are two important characteristics of the
attribute “team”. A business start-up team can then be complementary, but have no
experience or be not complementary and have experience, or have none of both. This
means that four different combinations are possible for the attribute “team”. For other
attributes such as uniqueness, only two levels are allowed: either it is unique or not.
-- Insert table 1 about here -The possible events associated with the twelve attributes summarized in table 1
can then be combined into ‘business proposals’ (or profiles). Theoretically any
combination of 12 (number of attributes) out of 30 potential events is possible. This
would result in more than 1000 theoretically feasible business proposals or profiles. The
total number of profiles resulting from all possible combinations of the levels would
become too great for respondents to score in a meaningful way. Therefore, a fractional
factorial design using Addelman’s basic plans (Addelman, 1962) for designing an
orthogonal main effects plan was chosen. This resulted in 27 business proposals that

12

<-----Page 12----->were presented to the respondents (investment managers). These 27 proposals were
printed on ‘cards’ used during the interviews (see figure 1 for example of such a business
proposal). Investment managers were asked to judge the proposals on a five-point Likert
scale (1= bad investment opportunity, I would certainly not invest; 5= major investment
opportunity, large chance of investing). From these scores, conjoint analysis derived
utility scores for each attribute. Utility scores are measures of how important each
characteristic is to the respondent’s overall preference of a product. Based on these utility
scores importance scores were computed by taking the utility score for the particular
factor and dividing it by the sum of all utility scores.
-- Insert figure 1 about here -The sample
A stratified sample of 68 VC firms was drawn from different regions across
Europe. We selected the regions as being those with the highest R&D intensity and
venture capital presence. Since we only considered early stage high tech, we needed to
get an international dataset because the number of VCs of any one country, outside of the
US, would have been too small. The seven regions were: Cambridge/London region
(UK), Ile de France (France), Flanders (Belgium), North Holland (the Netherlands),
Bavaria (Germany), Stockholm region (Sweden), Helsinki region (Finland). The number
of respondents in each region is presented in table 2. In each region, we wanted to have a
representation of small and large funds with various degrees of public funding. A random
sampling based upon the most widespread available sample frame, i.e. the EVCA-filings,
would result in a sample biased towards the larger private venture capital firms.
Therefore, we created our own sample frame, collating the directory information from
EVCA with those of the various regional venture capital associations and information
obtained through contacts we had with academics that cover the topic in each of the
seven regions selected. This resulted in a population of 220 funds. We only included
funds that are investing early stage and high tech. The sample frame was stratified in
different groups or subpopulations according to the scale of the funds (small funds versus
mega funds) and their institutional investors (captives, private funds, public funds,

13

<-----Page 13----->private/public partnerships) in order to avoid sample selection bias. Figure 2 shows also
the representativeness of these funds in comparison with the total number of funds in
high tech and early stage and their capital managed per region, selected in our database.
-- Insert table 2 about here --- Insert figure 2 about here -Data collection
The interview consisted of two parts and took on average 1,5 hours. Data were
collected during the period January 2003-November 2003. First, we collected information
about the resource-based characteristics of the venture capital firm, and the investment
manger interviewed. Information that we obtained before the interview, such as website
information was verified and completed during the interview. This includes information
on fund size, origin of the funds, number of years since establishment, number of
investments made in early stage high tech, sectors of investment etc. Information on the
investment manager included information on education, experience (as an entrepreneur,
in business, as an investment manager) and his/her sectoral focus. Second, we studied
how these investment managers select projects using the 27 business proposals. Before
the respondents scored the proposals, we showed them a fictive business card (see figure
1), in order that they would understand the criteria we combined in the cards, and
outlined the definitions used (see table 3). This allowed us to make sure that each
respondent had the same understanding of a criterion. The investment managers judged
the business proposals on a 1-5 scale. In addition, all respondents were asked to provide a
justification for the scores. This allowed us not only to get an insight into the selection
process and the importance of certain criteria, but also to get an insight into the reasoning
behind the respondents’ decision process. In this way, we could both collect quantitative
and qualitative data on the selection process, in contrast to previous research using
conjoint analysis. Quantitative analysis allowed us to examine the relative importance of
the different selection criteria, and the qualitative data permitted us to interpret the results
obtained from the analysis.

14

<-----Page 14----->-- Insert table 3 about here -RESULTS
The heterogeneity of early stage high tech VC investment selection behaviour
From the scores investment managers gave to the 27 business proposals, conjoint
analysis derived utility scores for each attribute. Utility scores are measures of how
important each characteristic is to the respondent’s overall preference of a product. Based
on these utility scores importance scores were computed by taking the utility score for the
particular factor and dividing it by the sum of all utility scores. Using the importance
scores, relative rankings of the investment decision criteria per respondent could be
made.

The model proved the internal validity of the data (high Pearson’s R and

Kendall’s tau statistics).
Figure 3 provides an insight into the ranking given by early stage high tech
investors to selection criteria. Descriptives for the importance scores of each criterion are
given in table 4. The results show that the potential return on investment, and people
characteristics, such as the ability of the entrepreneur and the characteristics of his/her
team were the most important selection criteria overall. Size and geographical breadth of
the market (global or regional) and whether or not a technology is a platform technology
have little impact on the VC’s decision.
-- Insert figure 3 here --- Insert table 4 about here -In order to examine the extent to which this group of early stage high tech
investors exhibits heterogeneity in terms of their investment selection processes we
employed a cluster analysis. Cluster analysis encompasses a number of different
classification algorithms, which can be classified into two broad families: hierarchical
and non-hierarchical clustering. Ketchen & Shook (1996) suggest using both procedures
as complements to each other: first a hierarchical procedure can be used as an exploratory
methodology to determine the desired number of clusters and as input to the non-

15

<-----Page 15----->hierarchical step. We follow this two-step approach. To perform the hierarchical cluster
analysis, we follow Ward’s procedure with squared Euclidean distance as linkage
measures (Hambrick (1983)). We used the output of the conjoint analysis presented in
figure 3, being the importance scores derived from the interviewee’s responses.
Importance scores link to the following criteria: characteristics of the team,
characteristics of the lead entrepreneur, contact with the lead entrepreneur, market size,
market growth, geography of the market, platform technology, protect ability of the
product, uniqueness of the product, market acceptance, time to break-even and return on
investment. Following the criteria of Hair et al (1992), we find a three clusters-solution as
the most appropriate for our data. Subsequently, we performed a k-means clustering with
three clusters as the predefined number of clusters and the same variables as inputs.
For ease of interpretation, each cluster was given a name, indicating the selection
behaviour of its members. The F-statistic of the variance analysis and the descriptive
statistics for each cluster are given in table 5. We found that 6 decision criteria were
significantly different at the 0.05 level for the three groups. First, the importance given to
the human resource variables as a reason to invest was significantly different between the
clusters (complementarity of the venture team, competence of the lead entrepreneur and
contact with the VC). Second, the market location (local versus global) was significantly
different. Third, the importance given to the protect ability of the technology
characterized certain investors. Finally, the financial part of the deal such as ROI was
significantly different. The specific cluster characteristics are discussed below.
-- Insert table 5 about here-CLUSTER 1 (20 VCs) we term the cluster of the financial investors. This group
of investors emphasizes the potential return set out in the business plan. As shown in
table 5, the ROI criterion receives an importance score of 24 out of 100. Business plans
that do not show sufficient potential return are not selected. Next to this financial
criterion, these investors also find the team complementarity and the market forecast
important. These investors mainly invest in complementary teams with strong leaders that

16

<-----Page 16----->are focussing on fast growing markets. If we add the importance scores attached to the
entrepreneurial team, competence of the lead entrepreneur, market growth and potential
return on investment, we get an importance score of 55 out of hundred. This means that
these investors base their investment decision on a very rational logic which is based on a
limited set of quasi objective factors such as ROI, growth and team completeness. In line
with this, it is the group that attaches the least importance to the contact with the
entrepreneur. It looks as if these investors want to have complementary teams with good
leadership potential, but do not bother much about getting along with the entrepreneur. It
looks as if they feel confident that a well established team will generate the financial
return they are aiming for, without too much interference or coaching from them.
CLUSTER 2 (22 VCs) we term the cluster of the technology investors. These
investors make a much more balanced analysis of a business proposal than the previous
group. This means that they take into account much more criteria than the other VCs.
Many criteria receive an equal weight in the final decision and only the degree to which
the technology can be protected and the contact the investment manager has with the
entrepreneur receive an importance score of more than 10 out of 100. This group of
investors also emphasizes the “uniqueness” of the product. Next to these factors, also
potential market growth, return on investment and uniqueness of the product matter.
Protection ability and contact with the entrepreneur are factors on which they differ from
other investors; they attach much more importance to these criteria than the other groups
of VCs.
CLUSTER 3 (26 VCs) we term the cluster of the people investors.

important factors in the selection process are human factors, such as leadership capacities
of the entrepreneur and the quality (complementarity and experience) of his team.
Financial criteria come in at a second place. Closely connected to these human factors, is
the contact with the entrepreneur, however, it is less important than for the technology
investors. This cluster also attaches the least importance to the ability to protect the
technology. The selection behaviour that this group demonstrates comes close to the
findings of studies based on post-hoc data collection methods which found that the
quality of the entrepreneur is the most important selection criterion (Wells (1974);
Poindexter (1976); Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) ; MacMillan et al (1985, 1987)).

17

<-----Page 17----->-- Insert table 6 about here -We find a considerable degree of heterogeneity in the way in which early stage
high tech VCs select their investments. In particular, we find a group of investors, which
emphasize the human resource or team characteristics; a group which puts most emphasis
on the financial data (in line with real time studies); and a group which stresses the
technology characteristics such as patent ability of the technology and the degree to
which the technology can be protected. Furthermore not only do we identify key
differences between the focus of different VC firms in terms of their selection behaviour
we also identify differences between how balanced the firms selection criteria are.
Financial and people investors tend to make their investments very focused on few
criteria, where as the decision made by technology investors tends to be very balanced,
taking into account several criteria, and making a balanced evaluation of the business
proposal as a whole.
What drives differences in VC investment selection behaviour?
To test propositions 1, 2 and 3 we constructed a multinomial logistic model. In the
multinomial logit model, we estimate a set of coefficients β (1) , β ( 2 ) , β ( 3) corresponding to
each outcome category. Outcome category 1 is the cluster of “financial investors”.
Outcome category 2, the cluster of “technology investors” and outcome 3 the cluster of
“people investors”.

<-----Page 18----->The model, however, is unidentified in the sense that there is more than one
solution to β (1) , β ( 2 ) and β ( 3) that leads to the same probabilities for y=1, y=2 and y=3. To
identify the model, one of β (1) , β ( 2 ) or β ( 3) is arbitrarily set to 0- it does not matter which.
That is, if we arbitrarily set β (1) =0, the remaining coefficients β ( 2 ) and β ( 3) would
measure the change relative to the y=1 group. If we instead set β ( 2 ) =0, the remaining
coefficients β (1) and β ( 3) would measure the change relative to the y=2 group. The
coefficients would differ because they have different interpretations, but the predicted
probabilities for y = 1, 2 and 3 would still be the same. The results that are reported in
table 8 (see further) have as a default the cluster of “people investors” as a control group.
In addition, we tested a model which had cluster 2, the “technology investors” as a base
group. Doing so, this allows us to interpret eventual differences between cluster 1, “the
financial investors” and cluster 2, “the people investors”.
As aforementioned, previous studies have argued that the institutional origin of
the venture capital fund might have an impact on the kind of deals that the fund selects.
This argument was the basis for proposition 1, in which we position that the source of
funds of the high tech, early stage venture European capitalists will have a significant
effect on the selection criteria used by these VCs. For instance, publicly funded VCs may
not only focus on realizing a considerable return, but may also take into account other
factors such as employment and technological renewal. Bank funded VCs may be
inclined to following rules of thumb existing at the bank level, and may put much more
weight on financial forecasts, given the financial culture at the bank.
Proposition 1 stipulates that institutional origin affects VC investment selection
behaviour. Institutional origin was operationalized in the following ways. First, we made
a distinction between funds that are part of a larger management holding and those that
are not. A fund is considered to be part of a holding if it is part of a group of funds such
as follow-up funds or funds with different investment focuses, or if it is set up as a
subsidiary (for instance from a bank). Second, we made a distinction between captives or

19

<-----Page 19----->not. Captives are funds that are a 100% private equity subsidiary of a bank or financial
institute. Finally, we analysed the degree of public capital in the fund structure. Public
capital can be provided by European (f.i. EIF), national or regional authorities.
---insert table 7 about here--The results of the univariate analysis are included in table 7. Since the number of
captives (n=5) is too small, we decided to omit this variable in the multivariate model,
presented in table 8.
---insert table 8 about here--After controlling for age and size (operationalized by the capital managed), we do
not find a significant difference with respect to holding structure although the funds that
belong to a holding tend to be less prevalent among the technology investors. Second, we
examined the difference in the degree of public money, which these funds have access to.
Table 8 shows that among the technology investors, the availability of public money is
significantly larger than among the people investors. However, the percentage of public
money used by the financial investors is not significantly larger than that used by the
people investors. This suggests that it are especially the technology investors which make
significantly more use of public money.4 The venture capitalists that belong to these
investors have over 30% of their money from public funds such as national government
initiatives or the European Investment Fund. Financial investors however make the least
use of these public sources (Table 7). Only 8% of their fund structure is on average of
public origin. We can thus conclude that P1 receives mixed support. The source of funds
of the technology investors is different from that of the financial and people investors.
The percentage of public capital is significantly different, however we do not receive
sufficient support to conclude that the holding structure is also different.

4

This is confirmed by the additional analyses using technology investors as a base group. The two other
clusters have signicantly less public money in their capital.
20

<-----Page 20----->Proposition 2 stipulates that the background and experience of the investment
manager will significantly affect the way in which the selection is performed. To
operationalize this we examined three different kinds of experience or background. First,
we made a distinction between those investment managers with a business degree (MBA)
and those without. Second, we measured whether they had experience in previous jobs
and if so, what kind of job they had done. If they worked in a bank or accountancy firm,
we classified this as having financial experience. If they had worked at university after
graduating, we labelled this academic experience. If they had worked as a consultant, this
was coded as consulting experience. If they had been entrepreneurs themselves, we coded
this as having entrepreneurial experience. Finally, if they had some overall experience in
a company, we labelled this business experience.
Few investment managers have entrepreneurial experience. This is surprising
since the funds in our sample specifically focus on early stage investments. Neither did
we encounter a lot of investment managers with prior experience in other VC funds. Only
one out of five of the investment managers had prior experience. This indicates that the
emergence of European early stage high tech venture capitalists is a pretty new
phenomenon.
Most of the investment managers have an MBA, however, the MBA variable is
not significantly different between the categories of investors. In terms of experience, we
find that bank and other fund experience is significantly higher among the people
investors than among the technology investors, while academic experience is much less.
Financial and people investors, however, do not significantly differ on these categories,
nor do financial and technology investors.5 This means that investment managers, which
have worked in previous funds or in a banking environment, tend to find the people
characteristics most important. The financial investors lie somewhere in between, while
the technology investors excessively recruit academics. This is in line with the
expectations since this category of venture capitalists tends to be specialized in pre-seed
investments and are often linked to universities and/or public research labs. It seems then
logic that the prevalence of academics among these investors is highest.

5

Additional analyses with group 3, the technology investors as a base group for comparison do not show
any differences between the financial investors and the technology investors.
21

<-----Page 21----->We conclude that P2 receives mixed support. People investors seem to be the
most experienced investment managers, but this is only significant in comparison to the
technology investors, which inversely tend to recruit particularly less experienced
managers. Among them, academic experience is rated the highest.
Proposition 3 stipulates that the sectoral focus of the fund will play a role. To
operationalize this sectoral focus, we use the sectoral distinctions which are most often
made by the VCs themselves. We make a difference between biotech, ICT, industrial
automation and other.
More than half of the funds invest in biotech, which is not surprising since they
are high tech venture capital funds and biotechnology is considered to be a large and
attractive high tech domain. Again, the differences between technology investors and
people investors are the largest and the only significant ones. The percentage of
technology investors investing in biotech is significantly higher than within the group of
people investors. The financial investors are somewhat in the middle. People investors
invest significantly more in industrial automation than their colleagues in the two other
categories do. Each category of investors seems to invest in ICT.
We conclude that P3 receives support, but only for biotech and industrial
automation, and not for ICT investing.

CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
In this paper, we analysed how high tech early stage venture capitalists in Europe
select deals to invest in. To do so, we use a novel methodology which combines the
advantages of the post hoc studies and the real time studies. The post hoc studies have the
advantage that they generate well codified results that are easy to analyse, the real time
studies offer insights in decision criteria, which might be more implicitly taken into
account than explicitly remembered. The post hoc studies usually conclude that team
variables are the most important ones, while real time studies indicate that other variables
such as financial and product market expectations might be much more important than
initially thought.
Whereas most real time and post hoc studies make only a listing of the criteria,
which are found to be important, studies based upon conjoint analysis techniques go one

22

<-----Page 22----->step further and propose a hierarchy of decision criteria used. In line with these studies,
we also propose a hierarchy of decision criteria in this paper. Further, we limited the
analysis to early stage, high tech venture capitalists in Europe. There are several reasons
for this: first, the venture capital industry in Europe has boomed since the mid-nineties
and several specialized early stage venture capitalists have been created. Second, most
studies find a difference in selection criteria between early and later stage venture
capitalists. Our focus of interest is specifically on early stage deals and the differences
among these investors. Finally, investment in high tech companies has emerged as a
specific business in itself, attracting a number of investment managers and newly created
funds which would else not have been in the venture capital industry.
Using a cluster analysis, we find that the 68 funds are equally spread over three
clusters, which we labelled the “financial investors”, the “people investors” and the
“technology investors”. The people investors correspond most to the investors found in
the post hoc studies. They emphasize the team and leadership potential of the founders.
However, we also find the financial variables to play an important role for them. Market
size and growth are much less important. People investors tend to have the most
experienced and educated investment managers. It might well be that they are the longest
in industry and therefore it is not surprising that they correspond most to the profile found
in the older studies. A second group, which can be clearly distinguished are the financial
investors. 25% of their investment decision is based upon expectations about ROI. The
market prospect is also for them quite unimportant. The funds in these group are
managed by the least experienced investment managers. Finally, we detected the category
of technology investors. For this category, the extent to which the technology can be
protected and the contact they have with the prime founder of the start-up are key.
However, they also look at other variables such as ROI, market prospects and founder
characteristics. After all, they make the most balanced due diligence.
In comparison to the previous studies, we find that the product market
characteristics are overall considered to be relatively unimportant. This might be
explained by the fact that we look here specifically at early stage venture capitalists.
Start-ups usually have a less clear idea about the downstream market and make more
assumptions about this market in their business plan. This might explain why the venture

23

<-----Page 23----->capitalists investing in these business plans pay less attention to the proposed market
expectations. We also find that there is a category of investors, which is quite different
from the ones found in previous studies: the technology investors. They might be unique
for early stage high tech venture capitalists.
We further developed hypotheses in the paper about how to explain the
differences in selection behaviour. Previous studies indicated that institutional
background, the sector in which the venture capital fund is active and the background of
the investment manager plays a role. Indeed, we find differences that can be related to
these three groups of variables. First, we find that the extent to which these funds use
public capital is different. Especially technology investors make use of different public
forms of support. We can thus conclude that the availability of public capital on the
venture capital scene has attracted some funds with a deviant way of looking at
investment opportunities. We also find clear sectoral differences. Technology investors
have more frequently a focus on biotechnology than people investors. People investors
focus on industrial automation. Finally, we looked at the background and education of the
investment managers interviewed. People investors tend to be the most experienced and
have obtained the highest degree. Technology investors often have an academic
background. Overall, technology investors tend to be different from people investors
while financial investors fall somewhat in between.
From a public policy perspective, we find most public money invested in the
funds of the technology investors. Given that these investors focus the most on the
technological strength of a business plan, it looks as if this money is targeted to
technological renewal and stimulation of economic growth. This public money is
managed by investment managers that have a profile that is not common in the VC
industry. Quite a lot of these investment managers have academic experience, working
as research assistant or Ph. D. student in a technological domain before coming to the VC
industry. Very little of them have prior experience as manager of other funds, and are
thus new in business. They are more than other funds involved in biotech investing, and
less in ICT investing. As these investors are active in a very early stage more frequent
than the other groups (often provide seed financing), it is acceptable that they are helping
to overcome the market failure high tech entrepreneurs are confronted with.

24

<-----Page 24----->This study has important implications for practitioners. As our results show that the
background and experience of investment managers can influence the individual’s
selection behaviour, VCs may build their investment teams with a human capital
consideration in mind. Also high tech entrepreneurs can benefit from a better knowledge
of selection behaviour by VCs. It is particularly interesting to them to know how
selection behaviour is driven by the source of funds, the investment manager that is in
front of him/her, and the sector the investment proposal is in. This knowledge may enable
him to approach the appropriate investor for his proposal and may increase his/her
chances of finding finance. For instance, an entrepreneur with a proposal that builds upon
a strong proprietary technology but that lacks an experienced team may have more
chances of finding finance with a public fund than with a private one.
This study points to several interesting questions for future research. First, it would be
interesting to interview more than one investment manager per fund in order to determine
whether the results on fund characteristics and human capital variables still hold at fund
level. Second, it would be interesting to extend this research to other regions, such as the
US, and to investigate differences that exist between regions. Compared to the US,
innovative small and medium companies find it more difficult to get started and grow.
The dominant view is that this is due to the nature of capital markets and the problems of
raising finance for small risky businesses (Martin et al, 2002). Extending the current
research to US VCs may indicate whether US VCs differ with respect to selection
behaviour from European VCs, and whether this may explain differences that seem to
exist between the US and Europe in nurturing early stage high tech ventures.
