Predictors of the Survival of Innovations
Thomas Åstebro and John L. Michela

This article examines the impact of key success factors on the survival of innovations that have reached the market and were developed by inventors outside of established organizations. It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict, at an
early stage, the duration of the innovation’s length of sales, because this duration is
important to the ﬁnancial success of new products. A focus on survival also can
contribute conceptual clarity to the study of new product development. This study
uses the Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre
(CIC) in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data. The CIC is a not-for-profit
agency that provides various services to foster business development involving innovative products and services. Analysts in the IAP evaluate a specific product idea
or invention on 37 dimensions before it has reached the market. The data for the
present study involved these 37 variables evaluated each with a three-point linguistic
scale. As the evaluations of the criteria are subjective, they might be argued to
contain inaccuracies compared to objective data. On the other hand, the analysts use
multiple related measures of concepts that have been shown to increase predictive
accuracy. The use of experts who are unrelated to the projects avoids decisionmaking biases potentially associated with project managers’ assessment of their own
projects, such as unrealistic optimism. The recording of the expert evaluations of the
ideas before they reached the market and independent of the measure of success,
rather than using post-project completion evaluations, eliminates measurement biases such as hindsight bias and common method variance bias. Identifying information was used in these records to conduct a telephone survey of the inventors. An
exploratory method of data analysis is identiﬁed and used that distinguishes research-appropriate constructs and their indicators in these data. Cluster analysis
was performed, and survival regression correlated cluster scores with survival. Three
variables were found to significantly affect survival: anticipated stable demand,
price required for profitability, and technical product maturity. In addition, the degree of competition had a marginally significant effect. Because these variables can
be assessed at an early stage of an inventions’ development, the expected survival
time for a specific invention may be computed by entering these assessment values
into the described survival model. Then this and other information may be used to
compute the expected return of an invention.

Introduction

A

n early-stage evaluation of the potential
merits of an innovation has been shown to
have considerable value (Mansﬁeld et al.,
1977, pp. 25–32). It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict, at an early stage, the duration of
the innovation’s length of sales, because this duration
is important to the ﬁnancial success of new products.
While there has been extensive research on the predictors of project success (and failure) of innovations
and new products (reviews by Balachandra and Friar,
1997; Henard and Szymanski, 2001; Montoya-Weiss
and Calantone, 1994), little research can be located on
the determinants of innovations’ survival. Information about these determinants would have direct man-

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES
Dr. Thomas Åstebro is associate professor of strategic management
at University of Toronto. Previous to that he held the University of
Waterloo Associate Chair of Management of Technological Change
funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Councils of Canada, with industrial
sponsorship from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Dr.
Åstebro conducts research in management of technological change
and entrepreneurship. He has recently published in RAND Journal
of Economics and the Economic Journal. He is frequently invited to
give speeches on the subject of assessing entrepreneurial ventures
and has been involved in starting three companies. Previous to
joining the University of Waterloo, Dr. Åstebro worked as a management consultant in the area of business strategy and has consulted to major corporations such as Bank of Montreal, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Volvo and to institutions such as
the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. Dr. Åstebro
received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University and holds two
degrees in engineering from Chalmers University of Technology,
Sweden.
Dr. John Michela is with the Department of Psychology at the
University of Waterloo. Employees’ perceptions and motivations,
especially as affected by interactions in groups or teams, with peers
and leaders, is the overall focus of his research. Organizational culture, climate, and leadership are some of the constructs and domains of management literature that provide starting points for this
research. Most recently he has studied relations of these and related
constructs with organizational and individual performance for quality and innovation, and previously with stress. Because research
methods for studying these matters often are insufﬁcient, research
methodology is another aspect of his work. Dr. Michela has recently
published in the Handbook of Organizational Culture and Climate
and the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. John’s training and consulting span various topics in the ﬁelds of organizational
and team development, organizational research methods, quality
management, and employee selection and development. Dr.
Michela has a Ph.D. in social psychology from University of
California–Los Angeles and taught at Columbia University for
nine years prior to joining Waterloo.

agerial implications for the evaluation of new product
development (NPD) projects.
A focus on survival also can contribute conceptual
clarity to the study of NPD. Most studies use fuzzy
or sometimes no definition of new product success,
allowing the research participants to interpret the
outcome variable ‘‘success.’’ This produces both
measurement error and theoretical ambiguity. New
product success entails at least three criteria or outcomes: whether the product reaches the market (commercialization), how long the product remains on the
market (survival), and yearly profits. These success
criteria may not necessarily correlate. For example, a
product that early on earns high yearly profits may
not have a long shelf life due to entry of imitators. It
therefore makes good sense to study each of the three
success criteria separately to learn more about the
drivers of total returns.
This study examines the impact of key success factors on the survival of innovations that have reached
the market and were developed by inventors outside
of established organizations. Inventors are important
sources of invention and economic renewal in society
(Schumpeter, 1934) and thus merit attention in their
own right. In addition, to the extent that new product
success depends upon product and market characteristics, distinct from organizational factors (such as ﬁt
to a corporation’s other products and services), this
research should shed some light on factors in product
survival more generally.
Of course, there are important differences between
inventor and corporate product development. However, some of these differences imply that there may
be unique beneﬁt to using independent inventions for
research focused on product and market predictors of
survival. Independent inventors operate outside of established organizations and thus do not suffer from
the decision-making biases often associated with established ﬁrms (Henderson, 1993; Henderson and
Clark, 1990). Consequently, the products offered to
the market by independent inventors may be somewhat different in their features from those offered by
corporations, providing opportunities to detect the
inﬂuences of these features.
The present study uses the Inventor’s Assistance
Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre
(CIC) in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data on
NPD projects by independent inventors. The CIC is a
not-for-profit agency that provides various services to
foster business development involving innovative
products and services. Analysts in the IAP evaluate

<-----Page 2----->324

J PROD INNOV MANAG

a specific product idea or invention before it has
reached the market. The purpose of this evaluation
is to advise the potential entrepreneur on whether and
how to continue efforts. [For further descriptions see
Åstebro and Gerchak (2001), Udell (1989), and Udell,
Bottin, and Glass (1993).]
Analysts from the IAP use a ﬁxed set of 37 criteria,
each with a three-point linguistic scale, to evaluate
each new product idea. As the evaluations of the criteria are subjective, they might be argued to contain
inaccuracies compared to objective data (Henard and
Szymanski, 2001). On the other hand, the analysts use
multiple related measures of concepts that have been
shown to increase predictive accuracy (Henard and
Szymanski, 2001). The use of experts who are unrelated to the projects avoids decision-making biases
potentially associated with project managers’ assessment of their own projects, such as unrealistic optimism (Armor and Taylor, 2002) and hindsight bias
(Fischhoff, 1975). The recording of the expert evaluations of the ideas before they reached the market and
independent of the measure of success, rather than
using post-project completion evaluations, eliminates
measurement biases such as hindsight bias and common method variance bias (Campbell and Fiske,
1959; Fischhoff, 1975).

Key Success Factors for New Products
There has been a great deal of research on the determinants of new product success. Reviews can be
found in Balachandra and Friar (1997), Henard and
Szymanski (2001), Lilien and Yoon (1989), Linton,
Walsh, and Morabito (2002), and Montoya-Weiss
and Calantone (1994). The factors studied can be organized in the overall categories of product characteristics, organizational development process, ﬁrm
strategy, and market factors (Henard and Szymanski,
2001). Research and meta-analyses have provided
considerable evidence that a great number of factors
within these categories can inﬂuence the outcomes of
new product development.
An example of this tradition is Cooper (1981), who
conducted a retrospective survey of 195 new product
projects to determine the factors perceived by research
and development (R&D) managers to be associated
with perceived success. A factor analysis was conducted on 48 variables to generate a smaller and more
manageable subset of factors. Thirteen factors explained 69.3 percent of the variance of the original

T. ÅSTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA

48 variables. A total of 7 of the 13 factors were significantly related to perceived project success at least
at the 0.10 level. The model had an R2 of 0.42 and
correctly predicted 84.1 percent of the projects’ outcomes in a naive split-sample test.
However, this study found little common agreement with others as to the relevant success factors
identiﬁed by Balachandra and Friar (1997). Performing a meta-analysis of 60 research publications, these
reviewers ﬁnd contradictory results and little stability
regarding the significant determinants of success
across these studies; in addition there seems to be no
clear agreement even on the direction of inﬂuence of
the factors analyzed. Balachandra and Friar (1997)
noted four major sources of weakness in the studies
on the success or failure of new product development
and R&D projects, namely the quality of data (low),
the definition of a new product (fuzzy), factor selection and definition (weak reliability and validity,
small samples), and measurement of factors (unclear,
not standardized).
Henard and Szymanski (2001) found the following
from their meta-analysis of 41 studies of 24 antecedents that were reported frequently enough to permit
meaningful investigation:
 In multivariate analysis the significant and dominant drivers are relatively few: product advantage,
product innovativeness, marketing synergy, technological synergy, market orientation and competitive response intensity, with product advantage and technological synergy explaining the
most variance.
 A few select variables explains most of the variance—there is no need to measure a large number
of factors.
 Multi-item measures are more predictive than
single-item measures.
 The length of time that deﬁnes project success
determines the importance of several factors.
 Objective performance data yield stronger relationships than subjective performance data.
Different measures of success have been used.
Cooper and Kleinschmidt (1987) identiﬁed three
measures of success: ﬁnancial performance, opportunity window, and market share. Lilien and Yoon
(1989) and Grifﬁn and Page (1993) added other dimensions. It is acknowledged here that project success
is a multidimensional concept. This study’s purpose is
to analyze a single well-deﬁned and objective outcome

<-----Page 3----->PREDICTORS OF THE SURVIVAL OF INNOVATIONS

measure: the length of survival of an innovation in the
marketplace.
Focusing on the survival of new products, Asplund
and Sandin (1999) discovered that new beer brands
with low and decreasing market shares have higher
hazard rates and that products from ﬁrms with the
largest market shares face a greater risk of being withdrawn. The ﬁrst result is theorized to depend on the
unpredictable nature of consumer demand, where
ﬁrms gradually learn about preferences over time
(Jovanovic, 1982). The second result may be product
market specific. Results may be attributed to large
beer producers trying to squeeze out smaller producers by repeatedly releasing (and withdrawing) new
products (Schmalensee, 1978). Interestingly, Asplund
and Sandin (1999) could not reject the hypothesis of a
constant hazard over time implying an exponential
duration distribution.

The Present Study
The data for the present study involved 37 variables
conceived by the IAP to be success factors for new
products. Most of these variables have been investigated previously. In fact, the variables included in the
original instrument were derived by Udell (for an
overview see Udell, 1989) based on research in the
early 1970s that was current when the original IAP
instrument was constructed. Appendix A lists the 37
variables.
Approximately half of the members of this set of
variables are labeled in Appendix A as market factors.
Several of these variables, in the subcategory of demand, are straight from the economics literature (e.g.,
Mansﬁeld, 1968) and involve factors known to affect
the diffusion of innovations (size of market, growth of
demand, duration of demand, demand predictability,
product line potential).
The greater the demand, demand growth, and duration of demand, the greater the sales opportunities
and thus prospects for remaining profitable in the
market. Uncertainty of demand and product line potential also could play a role in determining survival.
Given stochastic demand and a ﬁxed cost in each period (for example debt repayments), then greater demand uncertainty leads to greater probability that
demand will not be able to support the ﬁxed costs in
any given time period (and shorter expected survival).
Also, if demand ﬂuctuates from year to year for any
given product line, then the greater the number of

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:322–335

325

product lines, the lower the probability that a significant drop in demand for a single product line will
cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the innovation altogether. That is, greater applicability across a
number of products or services provides for risk
spreading and reduces the hazard of exit due to random market events. Note that the uncertainty of demand and product line potential does not necessarily
affect the probability of commercialization unless one
assumes the decision-maker to be risk averse. These
factors therefore may have a differential impact on
innovation survival compared to invention commercialization, and the differential impact depends on
risk preferences.
The acceptability factors are derived from research
on the psychology/sociology of innovation adoption
(Rogers, 1995) (need, societal beneﬁts, compatibility,
learning, visibility, appearance, comparative functionality, and durability). While these were conceptualized
to condition the adoption decision of individuals, they
also may affect the duration of innovations’ survival.
If adopters’ decisions are distributed over time, the
greater acceptability will increase the probability of
adoption at any point in time thus increasing the sales
also in later years, marginally increasing survival.
The industrial organization literature predicts that
industry structure (existing competition, new competition) affects price and thus profits (Scherer and
Ross, 1990). Also relevant to price and competition
is protection (through patents, trade secrets, and so
forth), which indicates the degree to which the inventor can capture monopolistic rents (Cohen, 1995).
Higher profits, either through industry structure,
price, or intellectual property (IP) protection, would
lead to longer survival duration.
Innovations arrive in the marketplace with different technical solutions, and producers only learn consumers’ preferences over time (Jovanovic, 1982).
Inferior, or less developed, products may be released
on the market but, once released, have greater likelihood of being discontinued in each successive time
period as better solutions attract higher demand. It
thus would seem reasonable that the technical factors
(technical feasibility, functional performance, research and development, technology significance)
and the production factor ‘‘technology of production’’ would affect survival. Further, a lower absolute
investment for entry should lead to a higher probability of exit (Åstebro and Simons, 2003). A lower
absolute investment for entry means there are more
marginal inventors entering—inventors who would be

<-----Page 4----->326

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:322–335

the ﬁrst to exit. Note that the effect of the size of the
initial investment is proposed to be negative on commercialization but positive on survival duration
(Åstebro and Simons, 2003).
Several product variables available in the data,
such as expected safety and environmental impact,
were included in this study’s analyses even though
they may not have much variation. For example, the
rate of severe safety problems—sufﬁcient to affect
survival—may be too low in order to detect their effects in research like the present. One further reason
to expect different predictors of survival as compared
to commercialization is that the range of variables
drops when products with less favorable values are
kept off the market, and the remaining products then
survive with varying durations. For the same reasons
then, ﬁnding significant predictors for survival might
be more difﬁcult than ﬁnding predictors of successful
commercialization.

Data Collection
The sample frame for survival analysis consisted of all
valid records of inventions submitted to the IAP for
evaluation during 1989 to 1993. Identifying information was used in these records to conduct a telephone
survey of the inventors, obtaining 561 usable telephone survey responses for an adjusted response rate
of 75%. For background demographics data and tests
for sample selection bias, please see Åstebro and
Gerchak (2001). Out of the 561 inventions, 50 had
been brought to market according to interviews.
Three inventors could not recall the entry or exit
date, leaving 47 inventions for use in survival analysis.
The chance of commercialization is therefore approximately 50/561 5 0.09. Correcting for sampling plan
and conducting sensitivity analysis, the probability
of commercialization varies between 0.05 and 0.11
(Åstebro, 1998; Åstebro and Bernhardt, 1999; Åstebro
and Gerchak, 2001). This rate differs from Grifﬁn
(1997), who found the probability of commercialization of new ideas to be approximately 0.25 among
Product Development Management Association
(PDMA) member ﬁrms. Mansﬁeld et al. (1971) arrived at a similar estimate for large established ﬁrms.
The 47 inventions reaching the market represent the
sample on which the survival regression analysis was
conducted. Many of the inventions reviewed by the
CIC are consumer oriented (47%). Other fall into a
variety of other categories, including high-technology

T. ÅSTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA

(6%) and industrial equipment (6%). The sampled
record for each invention included ratings for each of
the 37 early-stage characteristics (Appendix A) on
which analysts at the IAP evaluate product ideas.
Data on the independent variables were consequently
collected before outcomes were observed, and independently of this study. Therefore, methods or hindsight bias are avoided. Evaluations of the 37 criteria
by the IAP experts were made on a three-point linguistic scale (‘‘acceptable,’’ ‘‘borderline,’’ and ‘‘critical
weakness’’). These were transformed into numeric
values with equal distance between the scores.
To alleviate concerns about interrater reliability, it
is noted that the IAP employed the same chief evaluator during the sampling period. Further, all IAP
analysts were trained in the procedure by the chief
evaluator. The initial training took two days, and
close supervision was required for an additional fortnight. Baker and Albaum (1986) tested the reliability
of the instrument across 86 judges and six products
and founnd Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.84 to
0.96.

Results
Consistent with the recommendation in Henard and
Szymanski (2001) to use multi-item scales in product
development research, the ﬁrst task of the present
study was to organize the set of 37 criteria into subsets
that could form composite variables, using empirical
methods.

Rationale for Using an Empirical Approach to
Form Composite Variables
The IAP’s list of 37 criteria was developed with several purposes in mind. One is to provide specific feedback to inventors about any shortcomings of products
(e.g., technical, usability) in case these could be addressed by additional development efforts. Another is
to assess overall likelihood of product success, which
might lead either to dissuading inventors with a poor
prognosis or to enhancing the prospect of continuing
product development and to obtaining funding for
inventions judged very favorably.
While the original criteria were derived based on
scientific research, the a priori grouping of the criteria
by the IAP appears to be somewhat arbitrary. For
example, although the 37 criteria are organized into

<-----Page 5----->PREDICTORS OF THE SURVIVAL OF INNOVATIONS

four overarching categories (technical, production,
market, and risk factors), some criteria in different
categories seem likely to covary substantially (e.g.,
tooling cost required to meet expected demand—classiﬁed as a ‘‘production’’ factor—and whether the likely size of required investment was likely to be
obtainable—a ‘‘risk’’ factor). Also, within each category there appear to be quite separate subcategories,
or ‘‘constructs’’ in the language of scientific research.
For example, risk factors included legal concerns
(e.g., product liability potential), dependence of the
product on other products/systems, and direct ﬁnancial risks.
Consequently, it was necessary to identify and to
use an exploratory method of data analysis that
would distinguish research-appropriate constructs
and their indicators in these data. In particular, this
study sought to identify homogeneous subsets of criteria that could be combined to form readily interpretable composite variables. In addition, it was
necessary that these combinations be distinct from
one another, to reduce the problems that arise in predictive analyses when predictors are overlapping.

Implementing a Method of Construct Identiﬁcation
Gorsuch (1983) noted that some investigators (e.g.,
Cureton, Cureton, and Durfee, 1970) have combined
factor analysis with cluster analysis to improve detection of constructs when measures have not been reﬁned a priori to provide simple structure. In this twostage procedure, correlations among variables ultimately determine the inferred structure and scheme
for combining measured variables into composite variables. However, by ﬁrst representing correlations in
terms of orthogonal factors1 (in a matrix of common
factor loadings), it becomes possible to calculate a
matrix of the distances of measured variables from
one another in the orthogonal-dimension space described by the factors. Such a matrix of distances is
necessary for the second stage of analysis—cluster
analysis.
In the clustering stage, measured variables (say, X1
and X2) are placed with one another in a cluster to the
1

This study used principal axis factoring as the method of factor
extraction, retaining the 10 factors with eigenvalues above 1. No rotation of factors was used because the clustering method yields invariant ﬁndings as long as factors remain orthogonal. Input data were the
37 ratings on all inventions evaluated by the IAP in the study period,
including those not brought to market (thus allowing a favorable ratio
of cases to variables and maintaining relevant variability in the data).

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:322–335

327

extent that they correlate with variables in a similar
pattern (e.g., X1 and X2 both correlate highly with X3
and X4 but not with X5 and X6). As noted by Tryon
and Bailey (1970), this basis for forming composite
variables2 corresponds very well with the concept of a
construct, for example, as discussed in Campbell and
Fiske (1959).

Interpreting and Using Findings to Form Primary
Composite Variables
Findings from the cluster analysis, which was performed on all 561 observations, are presented as the
‘‘dendrogram’’ in Figure 1. The dendrogram is the
pattern of lines connecting the 37 criteria to one another in a branching, tree-like structure. When measured variables appear near one another in the list in
the left-hand part of the ﬁgure, and when they are
seen to be connected most directly by lines in the
right-hand part, they are the ones most similar to one
another in how they correlated with other variables.
Such similar variables thus are inferred to be co-indicators of a construct.
It should be emphasized here that this branching
structure is fully empirical in nature; it is not a representation of how the present authors thought the
items should join. Judgment came into play in labeling the divisions implied by branching structure. For
the present study’s primary scheme for forming composites, the structure was divided into the 14 clusters
indicated in the column of Figure 1 that gives each
measured variable’s cluster number (labeled as ‘‘Clu.
Num.’’). One consideration in arriving at 14 clusters
was the fact that it takes approximately 14 groupings
to divide 37 measured variables into groups with two
or three indicators—and the wide range of content of
the 37 variables implies there can only be a few indicators of each construct. In addition, although not
deﬁnitive, a chi-square test of residual correlations
after factoring pointed to the existence of 14 factors.
Most importantly, the 14 clusters are quite interpretable. For example, cluster 1 is concerned with anticipated profit for the producer of the product.
Cluster 2 involves price but also investment costs for
the producer, which is a complication this research
will address. As a ﬁnal example, cluster 3 concerns

various marketing and sales costs for the producer.
The nature of other clusters will be discussed later in
instances where they predict survival.
Thus, a set of 14 composite variables was calculated according to the cluster numbering scheme in Figure 1. For example, the composite corresponding to
cluster 1 was formed by averaging ratings on Payback
Period, Profitability, and Potential Sales. Table 1
shows the Pearson correlations among the resulting
composite variables. None of these correlations is
high enough to jeopardize inferences from using these
variables in regression.

Regression
Given these potential predictors, the further task is to
regress the dependent variable, survival, on the composite variables while controlling for right censoring.
Maximum likelihood estimation of a parametric proportional hazard model of the general form was used:
hðtj Þ ¼ ho ðtÞgðxj Þ;
where ho ðtÞ is the baseline hazard function, parametrized as ho ðtÞ ¼ 1 ðthe exponentialÞ, and g(xj) is a nonnegative function of the covariates, here speciﬁed as
gðxj Þ ¼ exj b . This study reports unexponentiated coefﬁcients (i.e., the b’s) and leaves out reporting the
estimate of the baseline hazard, which is uninformative. The likelihood function is further adjusted by
adding a branch for those observations that are right
censored at time t, estimating the probability of censoring given survival until time t. The dependent variable is the probability of failing in each time period,
conditional on surviving until that time, and the independent variables (covariates) are the 14 clusters
identiﬁed in Figure 1. Higher values on the predictor
variables indicate more favorable assessments by the
IAP. Under the proportional hazard model, a negative regression coefﬁcient means that an increase in
the predictor decreases the probability of exit. Thus,
significant negative coefﬁcients point to predictors of
longer survival.
Findings from this regression analysis are presented in Table 2. Near the bottom of the table is provided
a test of overall model ﬁt, a likelihood ratio test yielding a chi-square value of 25.45, which is significant at
the 0.05 level. This test is analogous to a multiple d.f.
test for overall R2 in a conventional regression model
for continuous outcome data. Thus, this study’s test
indicates that there is some significant prediction of

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:322–335

329

survival overall from these predictors (despite the relatively small ratio of variables to cases and the resultant risk of overﬁtting the data). Not shown in the
table is the implication of this model of an estimated
baseline hazard pointing to a constant probability of
exit of 0.09 in each year.
Turning to the coefﬁcients and statistical tests for
individual predictor variables, it can be seen ﬁrst that
a significant (po.01) and positive (inverse) effect is
obtained for ‘‘Entry cost and Price.’’ ‘‘Technical product maturity’’ and ‘‘Demand certainty’’ have negative
significant effects (po.05), and ‘‘Competition’’ has a
negative and near-significant effect (po.10).
‘‘Entry cost and Price’’ combines three criteria:
‘‘price,’’ ‘‘tooling cost,’’ and ‘‘size of investment.’’
The positive association between price and exit probability is understandable because a higher price is reﬂected by a lower (not higher) rating by the IAP.
Analysts at the IAP rated lower price as more favorable (higher ratings) as, according to them, it would
make the product more attractive to purchasers.
However, this research ﬁnds that higher price is
more favorable to survival. The result lends support
to the idea that price is exogenously determined. That
is, prices are typically determined by choice of product/industry and are relatively ﬁxed once entering
competition (Jovanovic, 1982). This interpretation assumes that the inventors who bring their products to
market do, in fact, price their products higher when
IAP evaluators indicate that the price would have to
be relatively high. That is, it should be kept in mind
that this prediction involving price and survival, like
all other predictions here, is based on an evaluation
before product launch as it predicts later survival.
However, ‘‘Entry cost and Price’’ includes two indicators of the investment cost that contaminate the
ability to interpret the effect of price alone. Additional
regression analysis (proportional hazard) therefore
was conducted where the effect of price is separated
from the two measures of investment cost. This regression shows price to have an independent positive
and significant coefﬁcient value at 4.29 (po.05), supporting the previous interpretation, while the average
score of tooling cost and size of investment also
has a positive and significant coefﬁcient value at
3.18 (po.05). A more favorable rating by the IAP
of the size of investment, reﬂecting a lower absolute
investment, results in a higher probability of exit. The
IAP considers a smaller investment more favorable
because an entrepreneur ‘‘does not have to take as
large a risk.’’ However, in terms of survival a lower

absolute investment reﬂects a lower entry barrier and
therefore a greater probability to exit, which appears
to be due to the entry of greater numbers of marginal
innovations.
The next composite variable that predicts
survival is labeled ‘‘Technical product maturity.’’ It
consists of the items ‘‘technical feasibility,’’ ‘‘functional performance,’’ ‘‘research and development,’’
and ‘‘development risk.’’ High values on these variables at the time of IAP evaluation imply that the
invention is in a relatively advanced state of development.

The statistically significant composite variable
‘‘Demand Certainty’’ consists of two criteria: ‘‘demand predictability,’’ and the breadth of products
and services that the innovation lends itself to—
‘‘product line potential.’’ A high rating of demand
predictability suggests that the innovation faces
stable demand, rather than a highly ﬂuctuating
demand. The more stable the estimated future demand, the longer the predicted survival. This result
becomes most understandable by assuming stochastic
demand and a ﬁxed cost in each period. A high rating
on product line potential, on the other hand, suggests
that the innovation appears to lend itself to a variety
of products or services and that this rating is also
associated with greater sales longevity. Again, a simple and analogous probabilistic argument can explain
this result. If demand ﬂuctuates from year to year
for any given product line, then the greater the
number of product lines the lower the probability
that a significant drop in demand for a single product
line will cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the
innovation altogether. That is, greater applicability
across a number of products or services provides for
risk spreading and reduces the hazard of exit due to
random events.
The composite variable ‘‘Competition’’ consists of
items describing both competition from established
ﬁrms and the probability that there will be imitators
entering one’s market. Its effect is in the predicted direction but is only marginally significant.
Finally, to examine the robustness of results, an
accelerated failure time model with an exponential duration distribution also was estimated (not
reported). Results are entirely consistent with the

<-----Page 9----->PREDICTORS OF THE SURVIVAL OF INNOVATIONS

proportional hazard model, except that ‘‘Competition’’ does not have a robust effect across the two
model speciﬁcations.3

Discussion
It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict,
at an early stage, the duration of an innovation’s
length of sales, because this duration is important to
the ﬁnancial success of new products. New products
expected to live longer in the market are expected to
return greater profits, all else equal. Past research
(Mansﬁeld et al., 1977) indicates that managers can
inform their expectations by undertaking systematic
evaluations of innovations at an early stage of development.
Here, the duration of sales of new and innovative
product projects undertaken by inventors/entrepreneurs is studied. Although their projects are between
four to eight times less likely to reach the market
compared to new products developed in established
organizations (Åstebro, 1998; Grifﬁn, 1997; Mansﬁeld
et al., 1971), making generalizability to such products
uncertain, we note that commercially and culturally
significant innovations often do come from ‘‘garage’’based development efforts. Arguably, the original Apple computer is one example (Halliday, 1983). The
pull-top beverage can is another (Dalton, 2003); the
modern brassiere, yet another (Levins, 1996).
The present study’s results are not dissimilar to
what would be expected from a study of the survival
of new products developed by established organizations. New products that are technically and functionally sound (signaled here by the technical product
maturity predictor), that compete in industries with
higher price (generating greater profits), and that face
less intense competition are more likely to survive
longer. The results are analogous to those of the metaanalysis by Henard and Szymanski (2001) in that the
dimensions of product advantage and competitive response appear in both. The differences may be more
interesting and are discussed further as primarily a
function of the focus on new product survival rather
than due to the focus on independent inventors and
expert ratings.

This research also experimented with other survival functions that
did not constrain the hazard to be constant over time. Additional parameters reﬂecting nonconstant hazards over time were not significant,
supporting the use of the exponential duration distribution. Detailed
results are available from the corresponding author on request. Also
see Gerchak and Åstebro (2000).

If the entrepreneur has entered a market partly unaware that competitive conditions are as severe as
they appear after entry, those who entered paying a
lower ﬁxed entry cost and facing higher demand uncertainty would be more likely to exit. This interpretation of the present study’s ﬁndings meshes with
Jovanovic’s (1982) theory, which assumes that entrepreneurs have only a vague idea about industry competitive conditions when entering and learn most
about it after entry. It is to be noted that lower cost
of entry is likely to induce higher probability of entry,
while, as shown, it also induces a higher probability of
exit. The present study’s idea of focusing on a single
well-deﬁned outcome variable, the length of survival,
is shown to bear fruit. If one had examined the impact
on ‘‘overall success’’—mixing up the two outcomes—
the differential effects of the investment cost on entry
and exit probabilities might have washed out. It is
further not clear that demand uncertainty and product line potential play any role in determining commercialization success. The present article, however,
showed these variables both theoretically and empirically to determine the survival of innovations.
The present work also ﬁnds that higher ‘‘technical
product maturity’’ leads to longer survival duration.
This study’s interpretation is that development shortcomings carry through beyond product launch, such
that products launched before major development issues have been worked out encounter various difﬁculties implied in the items of this cluster (cf.
Jovanovic, 1982). These difﬁculties include inadequate ‘‘functional performance’’ for the customer
and a potentially wide range of problems (e.g., product reliability, manufacturability) implied in the remaining items in this cluster. The concept of product
quality (e.g., Garvin, 1988) captures many of these
risks for products that are less developed.
This study’s focus on survival contributes much
needed conceptual and managerial clarity to the study
of new product development. It was found that for the
typical invention the probability of exiting the market
in each year is approximately 0.09. Three variables
were found to significantly shift this mean probability
of exit up or down, and these three are possible to
assess at an early stage of the inventions’ development. With estimates of these variables plugged in to
the described survival model, one can compute the
expected survival time for a specific invention and can
use this and other information to compute the expected return of an invention. Gerchak and Åstebro
(2000) provided formulas into which to plug numbers.

The basic task in this research was to learn about
innovation survival from secondary analysis of an
unusual and promising database. However, it should
be recognized that the data were not originally intended for factor/cluster analysis and formal or statistical predictive analysis. On the one hand, the small
number of indicators for each composite variable was
far from ideal for power or stability of prediction. On
the other hand, three of these composite variables
proved to be significant predictors of survival. In addition, there was substantial collinearity in the raw
data, suggesting the usefulness of cluster analysis to
combine variables to reduce collinearity. Moreover,
the analysis resulted in composite variables that did
not deviate a great deal from the conceptual schema
of the IAP and that were quite interpretable. In sum,
this research judged the predictive variables to be
good enough on the whole, although better measures
certainly should be sought for future research.
A potentially problematic issue is that the purpose
of the early stage evaluation is to provide the potential
entrepreneur with advice on whether and how to continue R&D efforts, rather than predicting the probability of survival. In other words, the ratings for the
explanatory variables for a specific invention may not
stay the same after the evaluation if the inventor/
entrepreneur makes efforts to improve some of the
characteristics according to the advice provided by the
IAP. If entrepreneurs work toward correcting problems identiﬁed by the IAP and then succeed in launching products then the explanatory power of the
original criteria are biased downward. In addition,
the sample used for predicting survival was fairly
small (47 observations), leading to low statistical power. Finally, one should notice that the evaluation was
done well ahead of market launch.
Given these limitations, it is impressive that several
IAP criteria did predict survival individually and that
the set of criteria collectively provided statistically
significant prediction of survival (according to the
likelihood ratio test, as reported in Table 2). Holding
the pattern of ﬁndings at arm’s length, distinct kinds
of composite variables can be seen that did not provide any significant prediction and other kinds that
sometimes did. A seemingly key variable that did not
provide prediction was one involving profit quite directly (cluster 1). This variable was of a summary or
integrative–judgmental nature, and its failure to predict is consistent with literature concerning superiority of statistical over subjective integration and
prediction (Dawes, Faust, and Meehl, 1989). For pre-

T. ÅSTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA

dictive purposes, at least, it appears that it is best to
use component or attribute ratings that go into such
summary judgments, instead of the summary judgments themselves. Another kind of variable that did
not predict survival concerned risks such as product
liability or windfalls as when a product spawns unusual societal beneﬁt. Although variables of this kind
may affect survival, the present work suspects that the
rate is too low for detection of effects in a relatively
small sample like the present one.
Many would-be entrepreneurs probably will ﬁnd
most surprising the lack of ﬁndings for some of the
composite variables that concern market factors, particularly need, potential market, visibility of product
advantages, and comparative functionality. It is reiterated that this result might be due to the present research’s focus on product survival. The variables may
still be determinants of the probability of entry, and/
or the yearly profit rate conditional on entry. [See
Åstebro (2004) for an analysis of determinants of the
probability of entry.] Evidently, ‘‘building a better
mousetrap’’ in these respects is not enough for product survival. The innovation should (1) face stable
demand; (2) be saleable at a price sufﬁcient for profit;
and (3) undergo development before product launch
to an extent likely to promote product quality on a
variety of dimensions. These are, of course, business
considerations of the kind that the IAP was designed
to bring to inventors’ attention.
What can other researchers learn from this study
for future research? It is certainly possible and of interest to replicate this study’s design using other samples. What seem to be critical ingredients are (1) a
large sample of projects; (2) project screening criteria
measured at an early stage; and (3) a clear outcome
variable. Future researchers and early-stage evaluators also may beneﬁt from considering the empirical
scheme (Figure 1) derived for this study, which groups
and distinguishes many important product evaluation
variables. The previous dominant research design of
post-outcome mail surveys with fuzzy or no definition
of the outcome variable should be avoided.
