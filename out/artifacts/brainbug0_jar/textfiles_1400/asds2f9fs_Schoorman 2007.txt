AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL OF
ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST: PAST, PRESENT,
AND FUTURE

A considerable amount of research has examined trust since our 1995 publication. We
revisit some of the critical issues that we addressed and provide clarifications and
extensions of the topics of levels of analysis, time, control systems, reciprocity, and
measurement. We also recognize recent research in new areas of trust, such as affect,
emotion, violation and repair, distrust, international and cross-cultural issues, and
context-specific models, and we identify promising avenues for future research.

As we wrote our 1995 paper on trust (Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), we were struck by
the relative scarcity of research in the mainstream management literature focusing directly
on trust. This led us to several bodies of literature, including management, psychology, philosophy, and economics. We found that scholars
from diverse disciplines were presenting many
insightful views and perspectives on trust but
that many of them seemed to talk past one another. Our goal was to integrate these perspectives into a single model.
This work came to fruition at about the same
time as several other works on trust. Papers on
trust by Hosmer (1995) and McAllister (1995) were
also published in Academy of Management
journals that year, followed the next year by a
book edited by Kramer and Tyler (1996). The confluence of these works, fueled by practical concerns raised by now infamous government and
corporate scandals over the next decade, produced a groundswell of interest in understanding this basic and ubiquitous construct.
Since we were drawing perspectives from
multiple disciplines as inputs to the model, we
wanted to provide a model that was generally
applicable and would be used across multiple
disciplines. We were gratified to find in a recent

search that our paper has been cited over 1,100
times (according to Google Scholar). In addition
to management and general business, it has
been cited in such diverse areas as marketing,
accounting, finance, economics, information
systems, industrial engineering, political science, communication, ethics, law, psychology,
sociology, health care, and agribusiness. We
would like to use this opportunity to revisit some
of the issues raised by our 1995 paper and review how the field has dealt with them. We will
also discuss the new concerns and opportunities
for future research on trust.

CLARIFICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF THE
MODEL OF TRUST
Trust As an Aspect of a Relationship
One of the difficult conceptual decisions that
we faced as we developed our definition of trust
was to break with the widely accepted approach, to that point, that trust was dispositional
and “trait-like” and to argue that trust was an
aspect of relationships. That meant it varied
within person and across relationships. With
some exceptions (e.g., Driscoll, 1978; C. L. Scott,
1980), the dominant conceptual and operational
344

<-----Page 1----->2007

Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis

definition of trust in the literature was Rotter’s
(1967). We then went the next step and included
ability as an antecedent of trust that allowed a
party’s trust to vary within a given trustee but
across domains. The dispositional aspects of
trust considered by Rotter are contained in the
construct of propensity to trust in our model. The
literature that has followed our model has not
questioned this decision and has accepted the
view that trust is based in relationships.
Application Across Levels of Analysis
The importance of multilevel and cross-level
perspectives is gaining increasing attention in
organizational research. This has led to a call
for examining trust across levels of organizational analysis (e.g., Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). There is a need to understand trust
both within and between organizations because
methodological difficulties can arise in the absence of a clear multilevel conceptual model
(Currall & Inkpen, 2002; Mossholder & Bedeian,
1983; Rousseau, 1985).
We have heard from a number of scholars that
the 1995 framework is fairly robust across levels
of analysis. A bit of history on the development
of our theory may shed light on this issue. Early
drafts of our paper developed our trust model
across multiple levels of analysis. One of our
initial goals was to develop a theory that would
be applicable across levels of analysis. We were
careful to develop constructs that would cross
levels of analysis, and we developed examples
of how cross-level applications of the model
would work. Perhaps it was fortunate that early
reviewers of our paper made the accurate observation that the paper was very cumbersome
(and long) because it developed the multilevel
model. They recommended that we restrict our
paper to a single level. The fact that our initial
goal was to develop a multilevel theory is probably why the model works as well as it does
across levels, but we do agree with those who
argue that one of the weaknesses in much of the
current trust research is that it is limited to relationships at a single level of analysis, considering either dyadic trust relationships within
organizations or trust between organizations.
Several authors have recognized differences
in trust for single referents at different hierarchical levels within an organization (e.g., Cook
& Wall, 1980; Driscoll, 1978; D. Scott, 1980). Recent

345

research points out that trust should be examined at both the macro and micro levels within
an organization (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer,
2003; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998). While
the need to understand trust has been noted in
areas of study both within and between organizations, methodological difficulties can arise in
the absence of a clear multilevel conceptual
model (Mossholder & Bedeian, 1983; Rousseau,
1985).
Just as perceptions about an individual’s ability, benevolence, and integrity will have an impact on how much trust the individual can garner, these perceptions also affect the extent to
which an organization will be trusted. We defined each of these trustworthiness dimensions
so that it could be applied to interpersonal, intergroup, or interorganizational levels of analysis.
At higher levels of analysis, such as between
organizations, viewing the trustee in terms of
ability and integrity seems to be well accepted.
At macro levels of analysis, however, benevolence has received little attention. We defined
benevolence as the extent to which a party is
believed to want to do good for the trusting
party, aside from an egocentric profit motive.
Does the other company hold the focal company’s best interests as highly important? While
we may be able to identify situations, such as
sole proprietorships, where the owners have
strong bonds that display significant benevolence toward one another, the more traditional
mode is probably one wherein each company is
motivated primarily by its own financial interests. If this is indeed the norm, benevolence is
not likely to be the most important factor in the
development of interorganizational trust. However, acts of benevolence (e.g., allowing benchmarking) from a potential partner in a joint venture would help to build trust.
We contend that all three factors of ability,
benevolence, and integrity can contribute to
trust in a group or organization. Consider, for
instance, a supplier-buyer relationship. The
buyer may believe that a supplier is able to
provide a quality product in a timely fashion.
However, this only assures that the supplier
could perform. This does not mean that it will
perform, and, therefore, the supplier will not
necessarily be trusted. The perception that the
supplier has integrity suggests that it will fulfill
agreements as promised. Yet even if there is an

<-----Page 2----->346

Academy of Management Review

agreement, if the supplier’s ability to deliver is
questionable, it will not be trusted. If the supplier is perceived as benevolent, it will have a
strong desire to serve this particular buyer’s
needs. If the supplier’s integrity is suspect because, for instance, its track record with other
firms is inconsistent with its stated policies,
trust will again be lacking. As the perception of
each of these factors increases, we would expect
an increase in willingness to take a risk in the
relationship.
The trust of either the dominant coalition or
the management team is critical to understanding organizational trust, since it is this level of
trust that will govern the strategic actions of the
organization (Cyert & March, 1963; Simon, 1957).
As with individuals, we propose that some organizations develop greater propensities to
trust than do others. For organizations, these
propensities develop from geographic, industry,
and economic histories. A series of previous interactions with other organizations that resulted
in, for example, lawsuits or monetary losses
would lower an organization’s propensity to
trust. Conversely, a series of such experiences
as mutual benchmarking with various organizations that significantly improved the quality
processes for an organization would increase its
trust propensity.
In summary, groups and organizations can
both garner trust from other parties and trust
other parties. Our model was designed to understand the major factors that explain trust from
not only the individual level but from the group
and organizational perspectives as well.
The Time Dimension
One of the issues explicit in our theory was
that “time” would play an important role in the
meaningfulness of the variables in the model.
We noted that propensity, as a dispositional
quality, would be an important factor at the very
beginning of the relationship. We also noted
that judgments of ability and integrity would
form relatively quickly in the course of the relationship and that benevolence judgments would
take more time. Proposition 3 states that “the
effect of integrity on trust will be most salient
early in the relationship prior to the development of meaningful benevolence data” (1995:
722); Proposition 4 states that “the effect of perceived benevolence on trust will increase over

April

time as the relationship between the parties develops” (1995: 722).
Despite these assertions, in many empirical
studies researchers have raised questions about
the high observed correlation between benevolence and integrity and have questioned the independence of these variables. In a discussion
of several empirical studies, Schoorman (2002)
observed that the findings as a whole were completely consistent with the model. Those studies
conducted in laboratory settings were more
likely to show a high correlation between benevolence and integrity because the relationships had not had time to develop any real data
about benevolence. In field samples where the
parties had longer relationships, benevolence
and integrity were more likely to be separable
factors. We continue to find this pattern to be
consistent in our research. We think it would be
interesting for future research to establish more
specifically the process and time frames in
which each of the variables contributes to trust.
Trust, Risk, and Control Systems
In our model we argued that trust would lead
to risk taking in a relationship (see Proposition
5). Perceived risk moderates the relationship between trust and risk taking in our model. Trust is
the “willingness to take risk,” and the level of
trust is an indication of the amount of risk that
one is willing to take. Clearly, control systems
are an alternate mechanism for dealing with
risk in relationships. Recently, several scholars
have speculated about the relationship between
trust and control systems in dealing with risk
(McEvily et al., 2003; Sitkin & George, 2005).
Our views on this issue are developed further
in Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson (1997), in
which we argue that one of the major distinctions between agency theory and stewardship
theory is the use of trust versus control systems
to manage risk. However, we do not see these
mechanisms as being mutually exclusive. On
the contrary, when the risk in a situation is
greater than the trust (and, thus, the willingness
to take risk), a control system can bridge the
difference by lowering the perceived risk to a
level that can be managed by trust. For example, in an organization that has a culture of
“open book management” and transparency in
numbers (a control system), the levels of perceived risk may be lower. There is a greater

<-----Page 3----->2007

Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis

opportunity to empower employees by trusting
them to manage larger budgets and for employees to trust the supervisor that performancebased compensation is fair.
However, there is an important caveat that
must be noted. If there is a very strong system of
controls in an organization, it will inhibit the
development of trust. Not only will there be few
situations where there is any remaining perceived risk but trustworthy actions will be attributed to the existence of the control system
rather than to the trustee (cf. Strickland, 1958).
Thus, a trustee’s actions that should be interpreted as driven by benevolence or by integrity
may be viewed simply as responses to the control systems. The use of control systems is how
agency theory proposes dealing with risk management, and this does not foster the development of trust.
The Reciprocity of Trust
One of the limitations of our model that we
noted in the conclusion of our 1995 paper was
that our conceptualization was unidirectional.
We did not explore the reciprocity in trusting
relationships. This is a particularly salient issue
in the area of leader-subordinate relationships,
since the dominant view among leadership theorists is that leader-member exchange (LMX) is
mutual and reciprocal (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995;
Liden, Wayne, & Stillwell, 1993). In an extension
of our model, Brower, Schoorman, and Tan (2000)
argued that, unlike LMX, trust is not necessarily
mutual and is not reciprocal. One of the implications of this argument is that, in a relationship, A can trust B, but B may not trust A. This is
completely consistent with the approach to trust
and trust formation that we presented in our
model but is inconsistent with the views in the
leadership literature. Empirical studies that examine this reciprocal linkage of how one party’s
trust affects the other party’s trust in return,
rather than assuming them to be equivalent, are
rare (Serva, Fuller, & Mayer, 2005). We feel that
this presents a fruitful area for future research.
Measurement of Trust As “Willingness to Be
Vulnerable”
While the theory of trust described in the 1995
paper has been very influential in the development of trust research, the measurement of trust

347

has been a different story. We defined trust as a
willingness to be vulnerable to another party.
As such, suitable measurement of the construct
necessitates that questions be asked that assess
the extent to which a trustor is willing to voluntarily take risks at the hands of the trustee.
We developed a short, four-item measure,
with each of the items tapping into how willing
the trustor was to be vulnerable to the trustee.
We (Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis, 1996a) found
that veterinary doctors took bigger risks with
those employees they trusted more. The impact
of trust went beyond that explained by the ability, benevolence, and integrity of the trustee.
Despite the measure’s brevity, we found its internal consistency strong (Cronbach’s alpha ⫽
.82).
We (Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000)
used the same measure in a restaurant setting
to measure the trust that employees had in their
general manager and found an alpha of .62. This
measure of trust in the leader significantly predicted subsequent sales, profits, and employee
turnover in the restaurants (Davis, Mayer, &
Schoorman, 1995; Davis et al., 2000). Based on
these results, we concluded that if trust in the
general manager could be developed and sustained, it would be a significant competitive advantage to the firm, and the framework, including ability, benevolence, and integrity, merited
further consideration as an approach to building trust in management.
Using this same measure, a quasi-experiment
(Mayer & Davis, 1999) showed that trust in top
management was significantly improved by
identifying and replacing an invalid appraisal
system. While the alpha in this study was lower
(i.e., .59 and .60 in two waves of data), the testretest reliability was quite strong, at .75 over
five months and .66 over nine months. Furthermore, the quasi-experimental results were significant, even though the sizes of the groups
being compared were modest (i.e., twenty-two
and fifty-seven). In additional analyses we
found an average interitem correlation of r ⫽ .32.
For each item we calculated a correlation between it and a composite of the other three
items. These correlations ranged from .23 to .49,
with an average of .38.
These results fall well within Kline’s (1986)
description of a measure of a complex construct
that has maximum validity. Kline noted that
such a measure would only have low internal

<-----Page 4----->348

Academy of Management Review

consistency reliability. Internal consistency estimates suffer because of the brevity of this measure. As Cortina says, “[Alpha] must be interpreted with the number of items in mind” (1993:
102). If the measure were truly unreliable, we
would not have been able to attain the significant results we have repeatedly found with its
use (Nunnally, 1978). The results of these studies
all support the idea that while our four-item
measure of willingness to be vulnerable has at
times had lower than desired levels of Cronbach’s alpha, it is a robust, stable, and valid
measure of the construct as we defined it.
More recent efforts to develop the measure
have yielded higher alpha levels. Mayer and
Gavin (2005) expanded the measure to ten items,
yielding alphas of .82 and .76 for the plant manager and the top management team, respectively. Further analysis revealed two factors,
however. One factor consisted of the original
measure with an additional item, whereas the
second factor consisted of five items that generally cited willingness to engage in specific behaviors that would put a trustor at risk, such as
communicating sensitive information to the
trustee. The five-item general willingness to be
vulnerable scale yielded an alpha of .81 for the
focal plant manager and .72 for the top management team. Both of these were improvements of
.06 and .07, respectively, over the four-item measure. While results using the five-item scale
were reported in that study, the ten-item scale
yielded nearly identical results.
In what may be the most promising measure
to date, Schoorman and Ballinger (2006) expanded the original measure to seven items,
taking care to maintain the conceptual definition but not create redundant items. It has produced an alpha level of .84 in a sample of veterinary hospital employees. This measure
appears in the Appendix.
Gillespie (2003) developed and validated a
measure of trust based on the willingness to be
vulnerable definition. This ten-item Behavioral
Trust Inventory has good psychometric properties and shows promise for future research
based on this conceptual definition.
The upshot of this discussion is that measuring trust as we defined it involves asking questions that measure a trustor’s willingness to be
vulnerable. We are aware from numerous personal communications from other researchers
that many of them are concerned with the lower

April

than desirable alpha levels of our original measure. While we think that a combination of its
conceptual clarity, test-retest reliability, and relationship with other variables in the nomological net across a number of studies is just as
important a consideration as the alpha level of a
four-item measure, we recognize that development of the more recent longer measures with
higher alpha levels was warranted. The measures we have developed more recently appear
to have overcome concerns with Cronbach alpha levels. We believe that as these measures
become more widely available, more researchers will choose to measure trust as defined in
our 1995 paper.
On a related note, work on trust would be
facilitated by further development of measures
of propensity. Many researchers have found Rotter’s (1967) twenty-five-item measure too long to
include as a variable in studies with many other
variables and are concerned about its multidimensionality. Our adaptation (Mayer & Davis,
1999; Schoorman et al., 1996a), while much
shorter and unidimensional, has not consistently produced high Cronbach’s alphas (e.g., .55
and .66 in Mayer & Davis, 1999). We are not
aware of any brief, unidimensional published
measure of propensity that produces consistently high alpha levels. Development of such a
measure might enable finding more relationships between propensity and other variables of
interest, particularly early in the development of
a relationship.

NEW DIMENSIONS IN THE RESEARCH ON
TRUST
Affect, Emotion, and the Impact on Trust
The basis of our model was to understand how
parties process information about others,
thereby deciding how much risk to take with
those others. Perceptions of others and perceptions of risk inherent in the behaviors being
considered must be processed in order to come
to decisions about taking risks. For instance, as
one evaluates a trustee’s ability in the domain
of interest or considers relevant inputs about a
trustee’s integrity, one is thinking. As such, our
model represents a cognitive approach to trust.
More recent work has pointed to the fact that
trust also involves emotion. Williams (2001) has
pointed out that affective responses influence

<-----Page 5----->2007

Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis

how people evaluate their level of trust in another party. Similarly, Jones and George (1998)
have argued that emotions and moods provide
people with information on how they are experiencing trust. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) found
that emotional states— even unrelated to the
trustee or the situation— have an effect on trust.
Weber, Malhotra, and Murnighan (2005) have
shown that emotional attachments can cause a
trustor to take a sudden risk not warranted by
the available evidence.
Proponents of the strictly cognitive approach
to decision making about trust would argue that
while emotions may create a temporary “irrationality” about the data on ability, benevolence, and integrity, after a period of time the
perception would return to a rational perspective. Nonetheless, it appears to be clear that
emotions do influence the perception of the antecedents of trust and, therefore, the trust in relationships. It is also likely that this emotion
does dissipate over time after a violation of
trust. What is not clear is whether it ever completely dissipates and returns to a nonemotional
evaluation. Alternatively, while emotions are
being experienced, they may lead the trustor to
update prior perceptions of the trustworthiness
dimensions and trust such that even after the
emotions dissipate, the effect on the cognitive
evaluations remains. We think the role of emotions is a very interesting area of research and
will add a new dimension to the model.

349

ative responses. Dating back to the 1950s (e.g.,
Kruglanski, 1970; Strickland, 1958), some work
has been done that begins to lay the groundwork for how attributions are made when trust is
broken. We suggest that which trustworthiness
factor is damaged and how it was damaged
influence not only how repairable the damage is
likely to be but how effective various repair
strategies are likely to be. Repair attempts
might be looked at either as mediating processes within the feedback arrow in our model
or as influencing the trustworthiness factors directly (e.g., receiving information about trustworthiness factors outside the process of having
taken a risk that went awry). Further theoretical
work in this area to understand the conditions
under which various repair strategies are effective would help in developing prescriptive roadmaps for repairing broken trust.
Forgiveness is another evolving area that
holds promise for understanding trust repair after a violation. An insightful paper by Aquino,
Grover, Goldman, and Folger (2003) provides an
important separation between resolving negative emotions (i.e., forgiveness itself) and behaviors that follow that restore the relationship.
More work in this area is needed to determine
such basic issues as the conditions under which
forgiveness enhances trust repair after a violation, what conditions increase the likelihood
that an offended party will forgive the violator,
and the role that forgiveness plays in the trust
repair process.

Violation and Trust Repair
Some exemplary work has been done to understand trust violation and repair (e.g., Lewicki
& Bunker, 1996; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson, 1996), but this topic warrants more research. As part of their contributions, these authors highlight the idea that violation of trust is
likely to be an emotional event for the trustor. At
the time of this writing, a special issue of the
Academy of Management Review (edited by
Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer) focused on trust repair is in preparation. This is a very appropriate
topic and promises to add valuable insight into
the process by which trust development can
move forward after trust has been damaged.
We believe that in order to repair trust, it is
critical to first understand how it was damaged
in the first place, since different means of damaging trust are likely to require different repar-

The Concept of Distrust
There has been considerable discussion in the
literature about the concept of distrust, as well
as the relationship between trust and distrust.
Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies (1998) framed the
debate in the organizational literature, arguing
that trust and distrust are separate dimensions
and not the opposite ends of a single continuum.
They noted that two-factor models of satisfaction and dissatisfaction had been proposed before (Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman, 1967),
and that the contemporary evidence from studies of positive and negative affectivity supports
this view. Their main reason for suggesting such
an approach to the trust-distrust distinction was
because “relationships are multifaceted or multiplex” (1998: 442), and we need a model that

<-----Page 6----->350

Academy of Management Review

allows for both trust and distrust to exist in the
same relationship.
In our model we chose to take the opposite
(and more traditional) view that trust and distrust are the opposite ends of the same continuum. This is consistent with dictionary definitions—for example, Webster’s defines distrust
as “the lack or absence of trust” and Random
House as “to have no trust in.” In sociology,
Ross, Mirowski, and Pribesh define “mistrust” as
the “absence of faith in other people” (2001: 568).
Luhmann argues that distrust is a “functional
equivalent of trust” (1979: 71). Our definition of
trust—willingness to take risk (i.e., be vulnerable) in a relationship—means that at the lowest
level of trust, one would take no risks at all. We
felt that the complete lack of trust and distrust
are the same thing.
In our model of trust, however, we argued that
ability is an important antecedent of trust, along
with benevolence and integrity. This was a deviation from an emerging view that trust was
more affective. This point is further clarified in
Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis (1996b). The important implication of the addition of ability to
the antecedents of trust is that it creates a
framework of trust that is domain specific. This
is noted in our original article (1995: 717) and
follows from the work of Zand (1972). Trust being
domain specific allows for the multifaceted and
multiplex relationships about which Lewicki et
al. (1998) raised concerns. For example, it may be
appropriate to trust a colleague to do a good job
collaborating on a research project but to not
trust him/her to do a good job teaching your
class in your absence. The difference in the level
of trust within the same relationship is a function of the different abilities across different domains. The skills required to present and interact effectively in class differ from those
necessary to do research.
Lewicki et al. (1998) produced a chart with a
high trust and high distrust condition in which
one would presumably “trust, but verify.” We
feel this is not a reasonable argument within
domain. If you trust a partner, you do not need to
verify. Doing so would be the clearest indication
that you do not trust. We do agree that you might
trust your colleague to produce a literature review but may need to verify his/her ability to
deliver in the classroom by reviewing his/her
lecture notes and presentation. Our model says

April

that you don’t need different constructs to account for this.
McKnight and Chervany (2001) produced an
excellent summary of the literature on definitions of trust and distrust and the models that
describe each of the constructs. They reviewed
the literature on trust and distrust and developed separate conceptual models (antecedent
and contextual variables) for each construct.
The resulting models are identical for both trust
and distrust, which suggests to us that perhaps
we do not need both models. In fact, these authors conclude that “most trust theorists agree
that trust and distrust are separate constructs
that are opposites of each other” (2001: 42). We
would simply add that if they are opposites of
each other, there is little added value to treating
them as separate constructs.
A review of empirical work on the conceptualization of distrust in the literature produced surprising results. Some who argue that trust and
distrust are different dimensions only study one
of the constructs at a time, making it difficult to
develop data on the differences. It is particularly
interesting that some researchers who study the
concept of distrust (e.g. McAllister, Pang, Tan, &
Ruan, 2006) have used our measure of trust as a
willingness to be vulnerable (Mayer & Davis,
1999; Schoorman et al., 1996b) and reversescored it to represent their measure of distrust.
In sum, we can find no credible evidence that a
concept of distrust that is conceptually different
from trust is theoretically or empirically viable.
International and Cross-Cultural Implications
for Trust
Over the same time frame in which interest in
trust accelerated, there was a significant increase in interest in studying cross-national and
cross-cultural differences. It is therefore not surprising that much of the explosion of interest in
trust research has come from around the globe.
Over 20 percent of the 1,100 studies listed in
Google Scholar that cite our paper were written
in a language other than English. The World
Economic Forum is made up of the world’s leading politicians and business leaders. It meets
annually in Davos, Switzerland to discuss a
wide range of international issues. It has been
monitoring public trust levels since 2003 through
a biannual global public opinion poll conducted
by GlobeScan Incorporated. The latest findings

<-----Page 7----->2007

Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis

from the poll show that trust in a range of institutions has dropped significantly since January
2004 to levels not seen since the months following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001
(www.weforum.org). GlobeScan reports that the
overall trust level for global companies is the
lowest since the tracking began. While we are
not sure what definition of trust was used in this
poll, these results present obvious reasons for
concern.
The recent GLOBE project by House and colleagues (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &
Gupta, 2004; House, Javidan, Hanges, & Dorfman, 2002) measured the cultural orientation of
sixty-two societies around the world based
largely on the cultural dimensions identified by
Hofstede (1980). These scholars used nine dimensions of culture, as well as twenty-one leadership dimensions. All of this research has led to
the inevitable question of how trust is different
across cultures (Den Hartog, 2004; Wasti, Tan,
Brower, & Onder, in press).
We believe that one of the ways in which
culture affects trust is through the propensity
variable. We have proposed that the antecedents of propensity include personality, experiences, and culture. There is evidence in the culture literature that initial trust of strangers
varies across cultures. One of the dimensions of
culture that is most relevant to this issue is the
task versus relationship orientation of a culture.
Task-oriented cultures seem to have a higher
initial trust of strangers and therefore a higher
propensity, while relationship-oriented cultures
need time to develop a relationship prior to
working on the task. The cultural variable of
uncertainty avoidance is well-established as a
predictor of predispositions to take risk or be
risk averse (Sully de Luque & Javidan, 2004). If
trust is the willingness to take risk in a relationship, how does uncertainty avoidance as a dispositional quality affect the development of
trust? We think there is considerable work that
needs to be done in fine-tuning what we know
about the influence of culture on the propensity
to trust.
Culture can also affect the perception of ability, benevolence, and integrity and the importance given to each of these variables in the
model. More action-oriented, competitive, performance-oriented cultures—what Hofstede has
called “masculine” cultures—tend to place a
higher value on the ability variable. More col-

351

laborative, being-oriented, “feminine” cultures
tend to put more emphasis on the benevolence
variable. While these are broad generalizations
of relationships between culture and trust, they
illustrate the potential value of future research
to develop these links more carefully.

Context-Specific Models of Trust
It was our intention in developing the model
to be as parsimonious as possible and to develop a model that would be generalizable to
the broadest number of contexts. In order to
achieve this, we neglected many specific context variables that would be relevant to a more
restricted trust domain. We think it would be
appropriate to specify contextual variables for
the model that are unique to studying trust
within a particular context. For example, much
of the research on trust in organizations has
focused on the relationship between supervisors
and subordinates. In this context, the hierarchical power difference and the asymmetry of information that exist between the two individuals in the trusting relationship have some
important implications for how trust might develop. If the supervisor has more access to information about the subordinate and can initiate
opportunities to gather information about ability, benevolence, and integrity, and if these opportunities are not available to the subordinate,
we would expect that the supervisor’s trust in
the subordinate would develop more quickly
than vice versa.
Additionally, since risk taking in the relationship is caused by an interaction between trust
and risk, one’s perceptions of risk in the action
being contemplated (which our model separates
from the trustee in question) will affect risktaking actions. Ceteris paribus, the party who
has more power in the relationship will likely
perceive— by virtue of that power—less risk
and, thus, will engage in more risk-taking actions. This would give the appearance that this
party’s trust is higher still. In the context of trust
between peers, there is likely to be a different
set of variables that predict the development
and use of trust. We expect that studies in particular contexts will develop additional variables that help better explain the antecedents
and consequences of trust.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have taken the opportunity to
reflect on our thinking as we developed the 1995
piece, “An Integrative Model of Organizational
Trust,” and the knowledge context in which it
occurred. This paper has given us an opportunity to revisit some of the decisions that we
made and to evaluate them in light of the research that followed. A part of our charge in
writing this paper was to indicate how our own
research in this area has progressed and how
we view the growing body of literature on the
topic.
The levels-of-analysis issue continues to be
an interesting topic of discussion, and more explicit extensions to group and organizational
levels are warranted. We note that time issues
addressed in our paper have not received the
attention that we expected. Research attempts
to study trust in very short laboratory simulations have yielded mixed but not unexpected
results. By including a consideration of time,
studies of trust should lead to more predictable
results. The interplay of trust, risk, and control
systems continues to be a much debated topic.
We have attempted to clarify our thinking on
these dynamics. We see trust and control systems as alternate and sometimes compatible
means for managing risk. We have extended our
thinking about the reciprocity of trust to explicitly recognize the notion that, unlike relational
leadership constructs (e.g., LMX), trust is not mutual and not necessarily reciprocal. The measures of trust that we had developed based on
our definition of trust have produced mixed results in terms of internal consistency reliability
estimates. Here we have explored some of the
developments and advances in the measurement area and have noted the need for continued improvement.
We also have reviewed some of the interesting new directions in the research on trust.
Prominent among these is the inclusion of the
role of affect and emotion, trust violations, and
repair. We believe these constructs will add new
dimensions to the model of trust and provide for
valuable research in the future. Another area
seeing rapid growth in interest is the role that
international and cross-cultural dimensions
play in the model of trust. We see the greatest
opportunities in the development of the concept
of propensity across cultures, as well as for the

April

relative importance of ability, benevolence, and
integrity across cultures. Finally, we note that
while we deliberately focused on a model that
was maximally generalizable and parsimonious, it is appropriate to now examine contextspecific variables that might add to the model of
trust. One such area that our research has taken
us into is the specific relationship between supervisor and subordinate in the workplace. Issues of power and information asymmetry make
this relationship and the trust it produces somewhat unique.
While a great deal of research has occurred in
the area of trust over the past decade, the new
research only suggests that there is a lot more to
be done and many very promising avenues to
pursue. We hope that our comments in this paper can be a catalyst for some of this research.

APPENDIX
Trust Items from Schoorman and Ballinger
(2006)
My supervisor keeps my interests in mind when
making decisions.
I would be willing to let my supervisor have complete
control over my future in this company.
If my supervisor asked why a problem occurred, I
would speak freely even if I were partly to blame.
I feel comfortable being creative because my
supervisor understands that sometimes creative
solutions do not work.
It is important for me to have a good way to keep an
eye on my supervisor.
Increasing my vulnerability to criticism by my
supervisor would be a mistake.
If I had my way, I wouldn’t let my supervisor have
any influence over decisions that are important to me.
