Abstract
Risk attitudes have an impact on not only the decision to become an entrepreneur but also the survival and failure rates of entrepreneurs. Whereas
recent research underpins the theoretical proposition of a positive correlation
between risk attitudes and the decision to become an entrepreneur, the effects on survival are not as straightforward. Psychological research posits
an inverse U-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial
survival. On the basis of recent waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel
(SOEP), we examine the extent to which risk attitudes influence survival rates
of entrepreneurs. The empirical results confirm that persons whose risk attitudes are in the medium range survive significantly longer as entrepreneurs
than do persons with particularly low or high risks.

Introduction

Recent empirical research supports the theoretical proposition of a positive correlation between risk attitudes and the decision to become an entrepreneur (see,
e.g., Cramer, Hartog, Jonker, and Van Praag, 2002; Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos,
2006). Varied studies (Stewart and Roth, 2001; Hartog, Ferrer-i Carbonell, and
Jonker, 2002) further show that the population of self-employed persons tends to be
less risk averse than other persons, such as those who are regularly employed. These
observations lead to the crucial question addressed in this paper: Do risk attitudes
also represent a defining characteristic of entrepreneurial survival? More specifically,
we analyze potential correlations between risk attitudes and the survival and failure
rates of entrepreneurs.
Prior economic research focuses only on the questions of whether and why
nascent entrepreneurs may need to be less risk averse than other persons, such
as employees, to achieve a successful start (Kihlstrom and Laffont, 1979).1 To the
best of our knowledge, the question of the extent to which individual risk attitudes
might have an impact on survival rates has not been explored in economic literature.
Accordingly, empirical research examines only differences in risk attitudes between
the groups of self-employed and regularly employed persons.
Psychological research also pays little attention to this question, though it
argues that entrepreneurs should neither take the highest nor the lowest possible but instead ‘well-calculated’ risks to become successful. Chell, Harworth, and
Brearley (1991) suggest an inverse U-shaped relation between risk attitudes and
entrepreneurial survival, where low (high) risk attitudes characterize more (less)
risk-averse persons. However, insufficient empirical research links risk attitudes to
the survival and failure rates of entrepreneurs. In a recent survey of the relationship
between personality traits and business success, Rauch and Frese (2007) conclude
that the effect of risk taking on entrepreneurial success is rather small, and this trait
does not necessarily increase success probability. The inverse U-shaped relationship
has not been tested either. A possible reason for this lack of empirical research is
that reliable demographic data about individual risk attitudes still are missing.

<-----Page 4----->This paper aims to close this gap. We employ a representative data set,
the German Socio-Economic Panel, which contained in the wave of 2004 several
questions about not only subjective but also objectively measurable risk attitudes.
Therefore, we conduct a rigorous test of whether the probability of entrepreneurial
survival correlates with the willingness to bear certain risks. To answer this question consistently, we control for the labor status of all entrepreneurs in the sample,
namely, whether they continue as self-employed or are in transition to an employed
position or unemployment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the
potential inverse U-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial
survival. We describe the data in Section 3, with a focus on the various measures
of risk attitudes, which we use in our further analysis. In Section 4, we present
the econometric approach, followed in Section 5 with a discussion of the results of
our analysis. We conclude in Section 6 that risk attitudes have an impact on the
survival of entrepreneurs. Specifically, we observe a non linear relationship between
risk attitudes and the probability of survival, which indicates that persons whose risk
preferences are in the medium range survive significantly more often as entrepreneurs
than do persons with particularly low or high risk preferences.

Risk Attitudes and their Impact on Entrepreneurial Success

According to Chell et al. (1991), there should be a non linear relation—more specifically, an inverse U-shaped relation—between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial survival, where low risk attitudes characterize more risk averse and high risk attitudes
indicate less risk averse persons. The hypothesis we test subsequently therefore
posits that among all entrepreneurs, the more risk averse and the particularly riskseeking persons are more likely to fail as entrepreneurs than are persons whose
risk-taking behavior falls within the medium range.
Because our analysis focuses on active entrepreneurs, we discuss this hypothesis
not in the context of their decision to become an entrepreneur. Rather, our focal
entrepreneurs already have chosen to expend a certain initial investment from among
2

<-----Page 5----->a continuous set of investments, in which each investment pertains to a certain risk
and a certain expected return. Entrepreneurs make risky investments only if these
investments will lead, ex ante, to higher expected average returns than would safe
investments, assuming those entrepreneurs are strictly risk averse. Accordingly,
we presume that the expected average returns of investments increase with their
riskiness. However, because a linear relationship between the riskiness of investments
and their average returns would be unrealistic, we further assume that the expected
returns of an investment are subject to decreasing returns to scale if the risk level
of the investment increases.2 At the same time (according to the definition of risk
as a stochastic process with a known probability distribution), we suppose for the
complete set of all possible investments that the variance between the lowest and
the highest possible return increases with the riskiness of investments, which also
implies an increasing probability of negative returns as the risk level of an investment
increases.
With the assumption that the risk attitudes of entrepreneurs correlate strictly
with the chosen risk levels of investments, we should observe positive correlations
between risk attitudes and the variances of incomes of entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
riskier investments should yield greater expected returns, because risk-averse people
require a risk premium. With decreasing returns to scale of risk, more risk-averse
entrepreneurs should select projects with a small amount of risk, so that the marginal
risk premium for an additional unit of risk is high. Less risk-averse entrepreneurs
instead choose riskier projects with a small marginal risk premium. At high levels
of risk, at which expected returns do not increase anymore (or even decrease), only
risk-neutral (risk-loving) entrepreneurs carry out their projects.
If these assumptions hold, it becomes straightforward to derive the consequences of the assumptions for the expected returns of investments and for the
survival and failure rates of entrepreneurs. First, we must bear in mind that, if a
person must decide between continuing or finishing an entrepreneurial activity, he
or she may be able to earn a certain wage income, which then represents the opportunity cost of continuing to function as an entrepreneur. Second, we note that
the realized returns of investments might differ from the expected average returns,
2

We cannot exclude the possibility that beyond a certain risk level of an investment, expected
returns are even marginally decreasing.

3

<-----Page 6----->and the decision to continue as an entrepreneur may depend on a comparison of
realized returns (not expected average returns) with alternative wage incomes, especially if and when realized losses in connection with liquidity constraints do not
allow continued entrepreneurship.
Having implicitly ordered the complete spectrum of entrepreneurs from those
with the lowest risk attitudes to those with the highest, we hypothesize that very
risk-averse entrepreneurs who have chosen the safest possible investments are the
most likely to generate returns that are less than their opportunity costs.3 As a
second hypothesis, if the risk level of an investment increases step by step, its expected return should exceed earnings from wage incomes (though of course low or
negative returns could be realized with certain moderate probabilities). Finally, if
the riskiness of investments increases dramatically, we hypothesize that it becomes
increasingly unlikely that these investments will succeed in terms of positive returns.
Rather, the probability increases (in comparison with investments with a medium
risk level) that “nature’s coin-flip” will force the entrepreneurs to realize monetary
losses.4 Thus, in this complete spectrum of entrepreneurs characterized by three
risk categories, we should observe persons with low and high risk preference who
must close down their businesses with higher probability than we will persons with
a medium level of risk preference doing so.

Data Set and Risk Measurement

We base our analysis on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), an established, representative panel survey that contains detailed information about the
3

This expectation is plausible: If incomes of a very safe investment exceed earnings from wage
labor, every person would become an entrepreneur and realize a sufficient income. In this context,
it is fair to ask why such persons become entrepreneurs at all. We cannot answer this question.
However, we also cannot exclude the possibility that these persons had lower opportunity costs at
the time of their decision.
4

Recent research by Baron (2004) and Köllinger, Minniti, and Schade (2007) provides further
explanations for why particularly risk-seeking entrepreneurs might decide to start a business venture, even if low or even negative outcomes may arise with relatively high probability. In their
research, they reveal that these persons tend be overconfident in believing of being capable to
exclude or reduce the probability of those low or negative returns. Moreover, the latter authors
also refer to further effects increasing the probability of failure of high risk entrepreneurs. For
instance, they observe an ‘escalation of commitment’ where this group is willing to make high risk
investments for another time once they realized losses in the previous period (interestingly, this
observation is confirmed in recent research in neurosciences, see Bechara and Damasio, 2005).

<-----Page 7----->socio-economic situation of approximately 22,000 persons living in 12,000 households in Germany.5 Key to our analysis are new measures of risk attitudes that
were added to the SOEP in the 2004 survey wave. Several questions deal with attitudes toward risk in general and in specific contexts, including occupation, the
relevant domain for employment decisions. Respondents indicate their willingness
to take risks on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (complete unwillingness) to 10
(complete willingness). Another question corresponds to conventional lottery measures and asks respondents to state how much (in categories of fifths) of 100,000
euros, which they hypothetically had won in a lottery, they would invest in a risky
asset. The question indicates that there are equal chances respondents will double
the amount invested or lose half of it.6 In contrast with the other risk questions,
which may incorporate both risk preference and risk perception, the lottery question
holds the perceptions of the riskiness of a decision constant across respondents7 by
providing explicit stakes and probabilities.8
We use the yearly outcomes provided by those individuals who answered the
risk question for the years 2000 to 2005, assuming the stability of risk attitudes
at least over this relatively short period of time (see Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and
Shapiro, 1997, for evidence that risk attitudes remain stable over time). As in
most empirical studies on entrepreneurial choice, we use self-employment as a measurable proxy of the concept of entrepreneurship.9 The classification of persons as
self-employed stems on a survey question about the occupational status of the respondents. If respondents are employed or self-employed in more than one position,
they report their status in their primary activity. We restrict the sample to persons

The SOEP started in 1984 as a longitudinal survey of private households and persons in West
Germany and then expanded to the territory of East Germany in June 1990. The central aim of
this panel study is to collect representative micro-data about persons, households, and families. It
is similar to the BHPS in the United Kingdom and the PSID in the United States. A rather stable
set of core questions appears every year, covering the most essential areas, such as population
and demography; education, training, and qualification; labor market and occupational dynamics;
earnings, income and social security; housing; health; household production; and basic orientation.

the sample period. Overall, we observe 7,325 person-year observations in which
self-employed persons are at risk of exiting self-employment, and 730 exits actually
occur.
Insert Table 1 about here
In Table 1, we provide mean values of the characteristics of those respondents
who remain self-employed and those who exit. The table reveals significant differences between the groups (see the last column, which reports the p−value from
a t-test of mean-equality). People exiting self-employment are more likely to be
female, less educated, and younger than those who remain. The answers to the riskrelated questions also differ between groups. For both kinds of risk measures, we
observe that persons with a low risk profile are more likely to leave self-employment
(except for people who invest nothing in the lottery question). However, to analyze
the impact of risk attitudes on entrepreneurial survival, we require an econometric model that controls for relevant characteristics and covariates, as well as the
duration of the self-employment, as we will present in the subsequent section.

4

Econometric Specification

To estimate the probability of exit from self-employment, conditional on the duration
of the current spell in self-employment, we introduce a discrete time hazard rate
model. We use yearly data, because the interviews occur once a year, and the
covariates are not available for higher frequencies.
Respondents may experience multiple self-employment spells during the observation period. Therefore, we use the discrete non-negative random variable Tik
to describe the duration of the k-th spell of individual i. When a spell terminates
in year t (measured from the beginning of the spell), Tik takes on a value of t. The
hazard rate λik (t) is defined as the probability that spell k for person i ends in period
t (i.e., a transition occurs) conditional on survival until the beginning of t:

λik (t|Xi (t)) = P (Tik = t|Tik ≥ t, Xi (t)),
6

(1)

<-----Page 9----->where Xi (t) is a vector of the characteristics and covariates of individual i in interval
t. The probability of remaining self-employed in period t (“survival”), conditional
on having survived until the beginning of t, is the complementary probability

P (Tik > t|Tik ≥ t, Xi (t)) = 1 − λik (t|Xi (t)).

(2)

The survivor function, which represents the unconditional probability of remaining in the current spell until the end of period t, can be written as the product
of the survival probabilities in all periods before and in t:

S(t|Xi ) = P (Tik > t|Xi ) =

t
Y

(1 − λik (τ |Xi (τ ))).

(3)

τ =1

Consequently, the unconditional probability of a transition in period t is the
probability of survival until the beginning of period t, multiplied by the hazard rate
in period t:

P (Tik = t|Xi ) = λik (t|Xi (t))

t−1
Y

(1 − λik (τ |Xi (τ ))).

(4)

τ =1

We employ the maximum likelihood method to estimate the model, which
enables us to take into account completed spells as well as both left-censored and
right-censored spells in the estimation. For a fully observed spell that ends with an
exit from self-employment, the contribution to the likelihood function is given by
equation (4). For a right-censored spell, the likelihood contribution is given by the
survivor function (3), because we know only that the person “survived” until the
end of the observation period, not when the spell will end. Combining these two
cases, the likelihood contribution of a spell k of an individual i can be written as

where cik is a censoring indicator defined such that cik = 1 if a spell is completed
and 0 if a spell is right-censored.
If a spell is left-censored in the SOEP, because person i enters the panel after
7

<-----Page 10----->spell k has already lasted uik years, we must condition on survival up to the end
of period uik , which means dividing expression (5) by S(uik ). Then the likelihood
contribution of the spell is

1 − λik (tik |Xi (tik ))

Note that this more general notation includes equation (5) for spells that are
not left-censored (uik = 0). In the SOEP, the retrospective employment history
questions enable us to recover uik for self-employment spells and thereby deal with
left-censoring.
The overall likelihood contribution of an individual i equals the product of
the likelihood contributions of the Ki spells that the person experienced in the
observation period. The sample likelihood function is the product of the individual
likelihood contributions:

We define a new binary transition indicator variable yikτ = 1 if person i completes spell k in period τ , and 0 otherwise. Then the log-likelihood function can
be written in the same form as the standard log-likelihood function for a binary
regression model in which yikτ is the dependent variable and the data are organized
in person-period format (cf. Jenkins, 1995).
The functional form of the hazard rate is specified as a logistic hazard model:

λik (t|Xi (t)) =

exp(f (t) + Xi (t)β)
,
1 + exp(f (t) + Xi (t)β)

(8)

where the function f (t) represents the dependence of the hazard rate on the spell
duration (baseline hazard), specified as a polynomial function of the third degree.
This model is consistent with an underlying continuous time model in which the
within-interval durations follow a log-logistic distribution (Sueyoshi, 1995).
8

(1 − λik (τ |Xi (τ ))).

τ =1

This function is of special interest in this context because it describes the
probability that a persons exits self-employment during the first t years of selfemployment.

Estimation Results

To estimate the main hypothesis of this paper, namely, an inverse U-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and survival, we employ two risk measures and four total
sets of explanatory variables. As outcome variable, we consider employment status
throughout the analysis, such that survival as a self-employed person represents
the success measure, whereas a transition to regular employment or unemployment
constitutes failure in self-employment.
Insert Table 2 about here
As we described in Section 3, respondents indicate on a 0-10 scale the extent
to which they are willing to take risks in occupational choices. This kind of risk
measure portrays the subjective risk attitudes of entrepreneurs. In Specification 2,
we present the impact of these answers on entrepreneurial survival for each possible
answer between 0 and 10. In Specification 3, we consolidate answers 0-2 in low risk,
3-7 in medium risk, and 8-10 in high risk categories. In addition to the subjective
question about risk attitudes, entrepreneurs also respond to the lottery question by
dividing a fixed amount between a safe and a risky investment. This question thus
reveals objectively measurable risk preferences. We analyze the results of the lottery
question in Specification 4. In Specification 1, we initially test the impact of several
basic socio-demographic and business characteristics—which in previous research
have an impact on entrepreneurial success—without including any risk measures.
These control variables also appear in Specifications 2-4.

9

<-----Page 12----->We provide the estimation results of the logit model for the whole sample
and the marginal effects of the risk measures in Table 2. The interpretation of
the marginal effects is straightforward: An increase (decrease) in the probability of
exiting self-employment occurs if the marginal effect is positive (negative). We also
interpret the economic impact of these changes in relation to the mean exit rate
(about 10% in the sample, see Table 1).
Always using the lowest category as the base category (i.e., no or low risk for
occupational choices in Specifications 2 and 3; no risky investment in Specification
4), we test the impact of the two risk measures on entrepreneurial survival and
failure. With Specification 2, we observe that in comparison to persons who are
willing to take no occupational risks at all, persons willing to take higher risks,
between 1 and 8 on the 11-point scale, have a lower probability of failing as selfemployed in a given year. Persons with parameter values of 9 or 10 for occupational
risks reveal no lower probability for entrepreneurial failure (compared with the base
category). From an economic point of view, we emphasize that the greatest decrease
in the probability of failing as entrepreneur emerges for medium risks. A risk attitude
of 5 or 6 on the 11-point scale decreases the probability of failure as self-employed by
5 percentage points. Because the predicted probability of failure is approximately
12.5% in the base category (i.e., complete unwillingness to take occupational risk),
the economic impact of risk attitudes in the 5 or 6 point range is remarkable: Failure
rates among these persons decline by 40% to about 7.5%. Overall, the estimation
results confirm the hypothesized U-shape depicting the relationship between risk
attitudes and failure rates.
We confirm these observations with Specification 3, in which we consolidate
the answers to the occupational risk questions. In this specification, entrepreneurs
willing to take medium risks in their occupational choices experience greater survival chances than do persons with either low or high risk attitudes. Thus, the
observed inverse U-shape between risk attitudes and survival is not sensitive to this
classification.
The analysis of Specification 4 reveals similar and complementary effects, such
that higher failure rates provide the significant characteristic. Although people who
decide to make medium-risk investments (between 40,000 and 80,000 Euros) do

10

<-----Page 13----->not suffer higher probability of failure than those in the base category, the less riskaverse (who put all their money into the risky investment) and more risk-averse (who
put only 20,000 Euros into the risky investment) respondents suffer a significantly
greater probability of failing as entrepreneurs. The highest marginal effect emerges
for persons who choose the highest risk in the lottery. For them, the probability of
entrepreneurial failure increases by 8 percentage points, doubling from 8% (in the
base category) to 16%. Overall, the results of this specification again point to a
U-shaped relationship between risk preference and failure rates.10
Insert Figure 1 about here
Using the estimated hazard models, we further calculate the cumulative failure probabilities over several years according to the failure function of equation 9.
Figure 1 depicts the cumulative failure probabilities of entrepreneurs with different
risk attitudes over the duration of the self-employment spell (based on Specification
3), evaluated at the mean values of the remaining explanatory variables. For all
three types of entrepreneurs, the growth in cumulative failure probabilities is greatest during the first years of self-employment, probably because of the higher failure
rates in the initial years of start-up firms. Figure 1 clearly shows that the relationship between risk preferences and cumulative failure rates remains consistently
U-shaped, regardless of the self-employment duration. Entrepreneurs who are willing to take medium-level risks thus have lower cumulative failure probabilities than
their counterparts with low or high risk preferences.
Because our data set also enables us to analyze the impact of several basic socio-demographic and business characteristics, we present the full estimations
results in Specification 1 (see Table A.3 in the Appendix). Beginning with the
socio-demographic variables, we observe gender and age effects. That is, women
have a higher probability of exiting self-employment, whereas younger persons have
a higher probability of remaining self-employed. In line with previous research, we
find a positive effect of a self-employed father. Having one does not only increase
the probability to become (see, e.g., Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000; Caliendo et al.,
10

The finding that people who invest the lowest amount possible (20,000 Euros) have a higher
probability of failing than those who invest nothing certainly represents a surprising kink in this
shape, however.

11

<-----Page 14----->2006) but also to remain self-employed. In a surprising result however, we discover
that entrepreneurial survival may be a matter of marital status. Both married and
separated persons suffer a significantly higher failure rate than singles. With respect
to education and previous working experience, we find several well-known effects.
Specifically, a university degree and previous working experience have significantly
positive effects, whereas unemployment experience has a negative impact on the
probability of remaining self-employed. Finally, we find an interesting wealth effect.
Although wealth has a positive impact on the probability of business creation (see
Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998), this effect disappears when it comes to business
survival: Capital income had no significant impact on the probability of remaining
self-employed.
Putting together the test results of Specifications 2-4, in which we control for
the effects of these additional variables, we can derive a straightforward conclusion
with respect to our main hypothesis: There is an inverse U-shaped relationship
between risk attitudes and the survival rates of entrepreneurs.

Sensitivity Analysis: We tested the sensitivity of our results with respect to
various dimensions. Using different risk measures (i.e., the willingness to take general
risks or risks on financial matters instead of occupational matters) does not change
the result, neither does a different classification of the three categories for low-,
medium-, and high-level risk attitudes (e.g., by changing the categories from 0-2, 3-7,
8-10, to 0-3, 4-6, 7-10). In a competing risk model where we distinguish between selfemployment exits to dependent employment and to unemployment, the U-shaped
relationship remains stable for exits to dependent employment. The relationship
also remains stable in a single-risk model allowing for unobserved heterogeneity.
Detailed results are available on request by the authors.

Conclusions

In this study, we empirically analyze whether the risk attitudes of active entrepreneurs
have an influence on their survival probability. For this analysis, we employ a questionnaire that was part of the 2004 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel

12

<-----Page 15----->(SOEP) and that asked respondents about both their willingness to take risks in
occupational choices, giving us insight into their subjective risk attitudes, and their
hypothetical decisions about how much to invest in a safe versus a risky investment,
which reveals their objectively measurable risk preferences.11 As we know from prior
research, it is important to control for both kinds of risk measures. Moreover, the
same survey indicates the occupational choices of all persons who answer the riskrelated questions.
Research in economics has yet to determine whether risk attitudes have an
impact on entrepreneurial survival. So far, it instead focuses only on the impact
on business creation. For this reason, we adopt an approach from psychological research, which hypothesizes that we should expect an inverse U-shaped relationship
between risk attitudes and survival rates, with low (high) risk attitudes characterizing more (less) risk-averse persons. Our results confirm this hypothesis: Persons
with particularly low or particularly high risk attitudes fail as entrepreneurs more
often than do persons with a medium-level risk attitude. This result notably holds
for all kinds of risk measures. Our analysis further reveals that the economic impact
of this variable is fairly strong. Specifically, the failure rates of medium-level risk
takers drop by about 40% compared with those not willing to take any risk, whereas
those of high risk takers almost double.
We thus conclude that risk attitudes ceteris paribus are a defining characteristic
of entrepreneurship. Whereas previous research suggests that these attitudes have
a significant impact on the decision to become an entrepreneur, we extend existing
knowledge by showing that attitudes have a similarly strong influence on the survival
and failure rates of already active entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the correlations
between risk attitudes and business creation are consistently positive; we show that
the relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial success is inversely Ushaped.

11

The validity of these findings also has been tested in a field experiment with real money.

The original SOEP question for the hypothetical investment is: Please consider what you would do in the following
situation:
Imagine that you had won 100,000 Euros in the lottery. Almost immediately after you collect the winnings, you
receive the following financial offer from a reputable bank, the conditions of which are as follows: There is the chance
to double the money within two years. It is equally possible that you could lose half of the amount invested. You
have the opportunity to invest the full amount, part of the amount or reject the offer.
What share of your lottery winnings would you be prepared to invest in this financially risky, yet lucrative investment?
100.000 Euros, 80.000 Euros, 60.000 Euros, 40.000 Euros, 20.000 Euros, Nothing, I would decline the offer.”
(b)
The original SOEP questions for the different areas are: People can behave differently in different situations. How
