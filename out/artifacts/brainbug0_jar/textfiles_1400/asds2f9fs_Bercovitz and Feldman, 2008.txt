his study explores the process of organizational change by examining localized social learning in organizational subunits. Speciﬁcally, we examine participation in university technology transfer, a new organizational initiative, by tracking 1,780 faculty members, examining their backgrounds and work environments, and following their engagement with
academic entrepreneurship. We ﬁnd that individual adoption of the new initiative may be either substantive or symbolic.
Our results suggest that individual attributes, while important, are conditioned by the local work environment. In terms
of personal attributes, individuals are more likely to participate if they trained at institutions that had accepted the new
initiative and been active in technology transfer. In addition, we ﬁnd that the longer the time that had elapsed since graduate
training, the less likely the individual was to actively embrace the new commercialization norm. Considering the localized
social environment, we ﬁnd that when the chair of the department is active in technology transfer, other members of the
department are also likely to participate, if only for symbolic reasons. We also ﬁnd that technology transfer behavior is
calibrated by the experience of those in the relevant cohort. If an individual can observe others with whom they identify
engaging in the new initiative, then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance. Finally, when individuals
face dissonance, a situation where their individual training norms are not congruent with the localized social norms in their
work environment, they will conform to the local norms, rather than adhering to the norms from their prior experience.

examining intraorganizational dynamics and the actions
of individuals in context (Greenwood and Hinings 1996).
The mere presence of macrolevel pressures does not
guarantee that new initiatives will be embraced. The
ability of organizations to change depends on the
willingness of individuals to adopt supportive norms,
routines, and behaviors (Whelan-Berry et al. 2003).
Organizational change occurs via the individual as “pressures are interpreted, given meaning, and responded
to by actors within organizations” (Dacin et al. 2002,
p. 48). Individual behavior may be inﬂuenced by prior
experience and by new information gained from physical space proximity or professional relationships that
provide an opportunity to observe and learn. Thus, professional imprinting and localized social context are
material microlevel inﬂuences (Schien 1985, DiMaggio
and Powell 1983, Bandura 1977). However, in the process of organizational change, individuals may ﬁnd
themselves in situations of dissonance where social
imprinting conﬂicts with the norms of local environment
(Festinger 1957). Ultimately, resolution will involve
trade-offs between competing inﬂuences and reﬂect the
individual’s choice to either engage in substantive compliance, or merely make a symbolic gesture. Understanding the decisions made by individuals about the adoption

Change, through the pursuit of new strategic initiatives, is essential to organizational survival (Van de
Ven 1986). All too often, however, organizations fail to
adapt to exogenous shifts in their environment (Kotter
1996, Christensen and Bowers 1996). The literature
highlights the forces that favor organizational stability and resistance to change (Hannan and Freeman
1984, Leonard-Barton 1992, Nelson and Winter 1982,
Tolbert and Zucker 1983). Even when top management recognize the need to change, publicly announce
new strategic initiatives, modify incentives, and divert
signiﬁcant resources to develop supportive organizational structures, the persistence of existing routines and
older norms of behavior frequently impede organizational transformation. The challenge of change is even
more daunting for organizations embedded in highly
institutionalized contexts with strong traditions and wellestablished norms of behavior (DiMaggio and Powell
1983, Kraatz and Moore 2002). However, some organizations do adapt, survive, and prosper. Understanding the
differential capability of organizations to change remains
a central, ongoing research question in organizational
theory (see Greenwood and Hinings 2006 for a review).
Recent research suggests that understanding variation
in organizational response to external pressure requires

of a new initiative requires consideration of the localized social context and professional imprinting, while
controlling for ﬁnancial incentives and opportunities.
Currently, there is a gap in our knowledge, as few
empirical studies link individual actions and the inﬂuence of organizational subunits to the implementation
of strategic initiatives. This paper addresses that gap
in the context of an initiative adopted by American
research universities to promote active technology transfer and research commercialization. Traditionally, academic institutions operated under Mertonian norms that
emphasized the open dissemination of research discoveries and eschewed direct commercial activity (Powell and
Owen-Smith 1996, Nelson 2001). Because of a convergence of technical, legal, political, and economic
factors that culminated with the passage of the BayhDole Act in 1980, an alternative archetype of academic
entrepreneurship that encourages commercial activity
has been articulated (Mowery et al. 1999). Slaughter and
Leslie (1997) describe initiatives in support of these new
norms as “academic capitalism,” while Etzkowitz (1983)
coins the descriptive term “entrepreneurial universities.”
However, for universities, the process of organizational
change has been challenging. Although, by 1998, every
Carnegie I and II American Research University had
technology transfer ofﬁces (TTOs) and were moving
toward standard technology transfer practices (Feldman
et al. 2002), there remained a noted performance gap
in the realization of these new technology transfer initiatives (Siegel et al. 2003). The decisions by individual faculty members to actively engage in technology
transfer signal their acceptance of the university’s initiative for academic entrepreneurship. Our study of those
decisions offers the rare opportunity to gauge the factors inﬂuencing the adoption of an organizational initiative at the individual level, within an intra-organizational
context.
This study examines the behavior of 1,780 faculty
members in 15 matched departments at the medical
schools of two prominent research universities. Medical schools were chosen as they are a key venue for
academic activity with commercial potential. Our results
suggest that the decision to participate in strategic initiatives is inﬂuenced by both social learning prior to
an individual joining the organization, and subsequently,
by the individual’s exposure to relevant peer behaviors
within the organizational subunit. We ﬁnd that those
individuals who trained at institutions at the forefront
of technology transfer benchmarking, or who completed
their training recently, are more likely to participate in
academic entrepreneurship. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that,
when the chair of the department is active in technology transfer, other members of the department are also
likely to be active, if only for symbolic reasons. We also
ﬁnd evidence of localized learning, as technology transfer behavior of individuals is calibrated by the activity

of their peers. If an individual can observe participation
by peers at the same academic rank in their department,
then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance, other things being equal. Finally, we ﬁnd that
when an individual has been imprinted with norms that
conﬂict with the norms of their local environment, it is
the latter that tends to dominate in the choice of subsequent behavior. In sum, our empirical study illuminates the intraorganizational dynamics that are critical to
orchestrating organizational change.
The paper proceeds as follows. We begin with an
overview of the technology transfer process and details
on the context we study. The second section draws on
the literature and the results of interviews with technology transfer managers and faculty members to develop a
set of hypotheses about the individual faculty member’s
decision to disclose new inventions. The third section
of the paper introduces the data and methodology. The
fourth section provides empirical results. Discussion and
reﬂective conclusions are offered in section ﬁve.

Faculty Participation in Technology
Transfer

The decision of individual faculty members to become
entrepreneurial academics and engage in commercial
activity with industry begins when an invention disclosure is ﬁled with the university’s TTO. While the university’s success with entrepreneurial activity is measured
with a variety of indicators such as the number of patents
applied for and received, the number of licenses and the
amount of licensing revenue, and the number of start-up
companies, these outcomes are only possible if individual faculty members disclose their ideas to the university TTO. Filing an invention disclosure is the initiating
stage of the technology transfer process, and all of the
subsequent measures of the university’s progress toward
this new organizational initiative depend on individual
faculty disclosing their research results.
At face value, the decision to disclose research results
should be straightforward. First, increased technology
transfer activity has become an articulated goal of the
university administration and is espoused as a strategic
initiative. Royalty-sharing incentives have been adopted
and TTOs have been organized to actively encourage
faculty participation. Second, disclosing research results
to the TTO is a stipulation of federal research grants,
which constitute the largest source of university research
funding. Faculty may be driven to disclose to remain in
compliance with, and thus eligible for, future government grants. Third, the costs associated with disclosing
an invention are negligible, and forms are readily available online. Fourth, any idea may be disclosed, as there
are no objective standards that faculty discoveries are
required to meet to warrant ﬁling an invention disclosure
with the TTO.1 Indeed, technology transfer managers

actively try to encourage faculty to disclose all ideas that
may qualify as inventions because the number of faculty disclosures is one criterion used to evaluate TTO
performance.2
Thursby et al. (2001) argue that invention disclosures represent only a subset of university research with
commercial potential. Thursby and Thursby (2002) discuss reasons why faculty would choose not to disclose
research results. First, faculty may not disclose because
they are unwilling to spend time on the applied R&D
required to interest businesses in licensing the invention. This claim is perhaps countered by the trend toward
patenting basic scientiﬁc results from projects like the
human genome which, though basic, may have immediate commercial potential. Second, faculty may not
disclose because they are unwilling to risk publication
delays, which may be required to allow prospective
licensees to initiate the patenting process.3 Our interviews with both faculty members and TTO ofﬁcials,
however, indicate that this is more a perceptual problem than reality. There are strategies to accommodate
both academic and commercial interests and experienced
peers can help navigate the process. Finally, faculty
members may not disclose because they believe that
commercial activity is inappropriate for an academic.
This view represents an older norm of open academic
science. However, to the extent faculty members do disclose inventions, academic norms appear to be changing
(Krimsky 2003).
An additional concern is that faculty may behave
opportunistically, bypassing the technology transfer process, and not disclosing inventions to commercialize
them without university involvement. Our interviews
indicate that this is not a substantial concern as commercial interests are cognizant of the potential for disputes
over intellectual property and generally require evidence of ownership before committing funds. Potential
investors conduct due diligence to clarify the origins of
an idea, and conﬁrm that if intellectual property is being
claimed by the inventor, the inventor, not the university,
holds the rights to the invention. In contrast to software or electronic devices, biomedical inventions require
infrastructure that would be difﬁcult for an individual
or small company to assemble. Furthermore, universities are increasingly active in claiming and defending
their rights to intellectual property developed by faculty
under federal grants or with the use of university facilities. Owen-Smith and Powell (2001b) suggest that incentives favor disclosure in the life sciences, as licensing of
biomedical patents is a demonstrated way for faculty to
earn economic returns and protect academic freedom for
follow-on research. Of course, faculty participation will
be inﬂuenced by the perceptions of the competence and
capabilities of the university TTO (Colyvas et al. 2002).
These perceptions, in turn, are shaped by institutional
history and environments.

71

Medical schools account for the majority of university invention disclosures (Mowery and Ziedonis 2002)
and are the focus of our analysis. The two universities
we study are similar in a number of ways. Both have
well-established and renowned medical schools with a
strong emphasis on research and knowledge creation.
Both had little experience with patenting and licensing
prior to the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. Both established TTOs in the mid-1980s and, by 1991, had adopted
similar royalty-sharing incentives for faculty inventors.
Moreover, beginning in the late 1980s and accelerating
during the 1990s, the administration of both institutions
articulated technology transfer activities as a strategic
initiative.
Yet, even within institutions, we observe signiﬁcant
differences in faculty participation. Table 1 demonstrates
variation in disclosing behavior by faculty members
in 15 matched academic departments within the medical schools at these two universities.4 In most cases,
the universities have a similar number of faculty members within each department. The exceptions being Cell
Biology (Cell Anatomy and Biology) with 53 faculty
members at University A and 19 at University B; Ophthalmology with 34 at University A and 112 at University B; and Neurobiology (Neuroscience) with 42 at
University A and 70 at University B.
Technology transfer activity is concentrated within
certain departments at the medical schools, as demonstrated by the number of faculty members ﬁling disclosures. We might expect that technological opportunity
would be greater in some ﬁelds than in others and that
these high-opportunity departments would have a similar
share of faculty who disclose inventions.5 This does not
appear to hold. What is rather striking is the variation in
the number of disclosures normalized by department size
or stated as the number of invention disclosure events
per faculty member.6 In aggregate, there were 0.384 disclosures per faculty member at University A and 0.414
at University B. However, there was substantial variation
between similar departments across the two universities.
For example, ophthalmology faculty members at University B averaged 1.2 disclosures each, while individual
University A ophthalmology faculty averaged 0.38 disclosures. Conversely, surgery faculty members at University A were approximately twice as likely to be involved
with disclosing as the University B surgery faculty. Considering the eight departments across both universities,
where disclosure events per faculty members are relatively high (greater than 0.75), we see that only 50%
of the time do the similar departments at both universities fall within this set. Further, only 30% of the disclosure events in our data set originate from these four
high-opportunity departments. While technical opportunity matters, it is clearly not the only driver of faculty
disclosure behavior.

The question thus becomes: Who discloses in the
faculty, what are their characteristics, and to what
types of incentives do they respond? This intraorganizational heterogeneity in participation in technology transfer among academic departments suggests that acceptance of the new norms of academic entrepreneurship are highly localized. As such, an understanding
of the individual actions as inﬂuenced by their local
social context is arguably key to promoting change at
the organizational level (Greenwood and Hinings 1996,
pp. 1023–1024). To develop hypotheses, we rely on
interviews with technology transfer ofﬁcials and faculty members.7 Every individual in the medical school
is expected to conduct novel research that could yield
publications and might generate inventions with commercial potential. High-prestige publications and patent
productivity increasingly are complementary (Blumenthal et al. 1996, Powell and Owen-Smith 1998). Of
course, individuals differ in their inventive capacity, but
it should be recognized that inventive capacity differs
from entrepreneurial propensity (Bercovitz and Feldman 2007). While we may expect that certain ﬁelds of
research would be more amenable to disclosure, the lack
of objective standards indicates disclosure is an individual decision.

We expect that faculty would be responsive to ﬁnancial
incentives and that there would be a direct relationship
between licensing royalty distribution rates and the
amount of technology transfer activity across universities
(Lach and Schankerman 2003). Our focus on departments within institutions holds these rates relatively constant because there is a convergence in incentives during
the time period we studied. Both universities have a
similar distribution rate with one-third of future revenue going to the individual faculty member, one-third
going to the central administration, and one-third to the
department.8
Though the expected value of individual inventions
may vary, two factors limit the differentiating inﬂuence
this may have on faculty disclosure behavior. First, as
noted by Lowe and Ziedonis (2006), most faculty members, as with other types of entrepreneurs, greatly overestimate the value of their ideas. American academics
are also known for being intensely competitive (Whitley
2003). Slaughter and Rhoades (2004, pp. 152–153) ﬁnd
that professors are familiar with stories of the success
of academic licenses and start-up companies, and liken
these stories to fairytales that can capture the imagination and set expectations of potential value. Second, history has shown the payoff distribution of faculty inventions is both uncertain and highly skewed with less than

<-----Page 5----->Bercovitz and Feldman: Organizational Change at the Individual Level

45% of active licenses receiving any licensing revenue
at all. Of those licenses that earn royalties, only 1.5%
generate an annual return greater than $1 million dollars
(AUTM 2003). Thus, the decision to participate in technology transfer may be viewed as an option on potential
future wealth rather than a direct payoff.
Given that opportunity to disclose appears not to be
dictated solely by technological ﬁeld and given that royalty distribution rates are relatively constant, this paper
focuses on the role of social interaction in the decision
of faculty members to disclose their inventions. Speciﬁcally, the decision to disclose appears to be inﬂuenced by
three categories of social interaction and organizational
learning that we term training effects, leadership effects,
and peer effects. Each of these is described below. Further, when faced with strategic initiatives, individuals
have a variety of response options. We explore the resolution of possible conﬂict between professional imprinting and localized norms, as well as factors underlying
variation in individual response.
Training Effects. Many authors have argued that
social institutions, with educational institutions being a
key subset, mold individual perspective by promoting,
both implicitly and explicitly, a particular set of norms
and values (Schein 1985, Locke 1985, Haas 1992, Calori
et al. 1997, Biglaiser 2002). DiMaggio and Powell
(1983, p. 153) emphasize the role universities play in
this socialization process, stating that those “drawn from
the same universities and ﬁltered on a common set of
attributes,    will tend to view problems in a similar
fashion, see the same policies, procedures and structures
as normatively sanctioned and legitimated, and approach
decisions in much the same way.”9 Support for these
arguments exists across academic domains. For example,
in a series of studies, Frank et al. (1993) ﬁnd evidence
that economics students, particularly those trained by
an instructor with research interests in game theory, are
more likely to adopt self-interested behavior than their
peers. Similarly, recent work in political economy shows
that the presence of U.S.-trained economists is a key
predictor of the adoption of various types of neoliberal
reform (for example, tariff rate reduction, capital account
liberalization) in emerging markets (Biglaiser and Brown
2003, Chwieroth 2003). In sum, the empirical evidence
suggests that professional training can imprint a particular set of norms. Acting according to these norms, students may serve as a critical conduit for the diffusion of
new ideas and practices.
In our context, the logic of imprinting implies that
individuals trained at institutions where participation in
technology transfer was actively practiced will be more
likely to adopt these practices in their own careers. Interviews support this conjecture. For example, one professor active in technology transfer indicated that he learned
about disclosing from his graduate school mentors, and

73

this inﬂuenced his expectations for a professional career.
While he recognized that the academic culture did not
support technology transfer when he joined the faculty, he believed that participating in technology transfer would provide a vehicle for implementing his ideas.
Similarly, the current president of one of the institutions we studied, started as assistant professor in 1972.
This individual learned about technology transfer during graduate study at Stanford University, in a very
active department in terms of involvement with industry. At the current institution, he continued to actively
disclose inventions and subsequently started a company.
His expectation was that technology transfer would be
part of his career. In contrast, faculty who received their
medical school training at institutions where technology
transfer was not perceived as a legitimate activity often
question the long-term impacts of this activity, both on
their careers and on the broader pursuit of science. Several, including the chair of one department who trained
at Cornell, had no intention of disclosing inventions and
expressed strong sentiments against technology transfer
pursuits even though this activity was supported by the
university administration. This foundation of theoretical logic and anecdotal evidence leads to the following
testable hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Individuals whose graduate training incorporated technology transfer objectives will be
more likely to participate in technology transfer initiatives by disclosing innovations.
The length of time an individual has been out of
training is also likely to inﬂuence their disclosure decisions. As Ryder (1965) notes, individuals are imprinted,
to some degree, by the major events that occur and
accepted norms that are prevalent during their formative stages of development. The doctoral and/or medical
training experience is clearly a formative period for academic researchers (Cartwright 1979). Levin and Stephan
(1991) conﬁrm the importance of timing in a scientist’s training ﬁnding that vintage, based on the year of
doctorate degree award, affected scientiﬁc productivity
in their study of the research productivity of academic
scientists.10
Though never static, views about the proper role of
academic scientists in commercialization activities have
evolved considerably in the recent past, both as drivers
of, and in response to, the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act. The
historic norm of open science, with the goal of publication and wide dissemination of ﬁndings, was previously dominant in academic communities. Recently,
however, both academic institutions and individual scientists have accepted that they have a responsibility to
become entrepreneurial and to work with industry to
leverage academic research for commercial purposes and
broader economic growth. Recent studies show that it

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded from informs.org by [155.247.166.234] on 20 August 2015, at 12:39 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.

74

is becoming increasingly common for academic administrators and individual scientists to consider commercialization as a key part of their missions (Zucker et al.
1998, Thursby and Thursby 2002, Murray 2004).
The training and exposure received by medical and
doctoral students were likely colored by this evolution
in thought (Cartwright 1979). The earlier an individual completed her training, the more likely she is to
have been exposed to, and adopted, the traditional norms
of science that do not favor disclosing. Conversely, the
more recently trained the scientist, the more likely she
encountered an environment supportive of commercialization activity. Thus we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2 (H2). The likelihood that an individual
will engage in technology transfer through invention disclosure will increase the more recent the vintage of their
last graduate degree.
Leadership Effects. Leaders inﬂuence behavior in
organizations both by building culture and by acting as
role models. The visible behavior of those in leadership roles drives organizational culture by signaling what
actions are expected, valued, and likely to be rewarded
(House 1977, Schein 1985). Furthermore, given that
individual behavior is shaped by the observation and
imitation of others in a social context, subordinates
vicariously learn what activities are deemed legitimate
and worthy of emulation by observing the actions of
the leader (Bandura 1977, 1986). Speciﬁcally, the stance
taken by a leader motivates a particular set of behaviors that inﬂuence the value systems of the followers
(Shamir et al. 1993). Culture and role-modeling cues
are most pertinent in environments beset with ambiguity.
For example, when the criteria for advancement are not
clearly delineated, individuals tend to adjust their expectations relative to the behavior of their leaders. Individuals may follow their leaders’ cues not only because they
have adjusted their attitudes but rather because they seek
to avoid disfavor and potential sanctions.
In academic departments, the department chair is the
leader. In medical schools, the power and inﬂuence of
the chair is particularly strong and appointments are
of long tenure. The chair plays a direct and powerful
role in reviewing and evaluating individual performance
related to promotion and tenure. One contentious issue
is how technology transfer activity is treated in those
decisions.11 The rules appear to be subjective and the
problem for individual faculty members is to discern
how activity will be evaluated.12
One signal that the chair is predisposed to consider
technology transfer as a legitimate activity would be the
observed behavior of the chair. If the chair is active in
technology transfer as demonstrated by his or her prior
disclosures, then he or she sends a signal that technology transfer is a valid activity. In this case, other
members of the department may be more likely to

disclose.13 We might expect that these social cues would
be stronger for junior faculty members who face greater
uncertainty about expectations regarding promotion and
tenure. However, our interviews suggest that senior faculty members also benchmark their performance against
the department chair.
Hypothesis 3 (H3). Individuals in departments where
the chair is actively involved in technology transfer are
more likely to engage in technology transfer activities.
Local Peer Effects. In addition to leaders, peer groups
also act as a reference point. When faced with uncertainty about the proper course of action, social learning theory posits that individuals will model the behaviors of referent others (Bandura 1986). Numerous prior
studies provide evidence that learning activity occurs
within a cohort of peers, as individuals draw inferences
about value by observing the choices of similar others (Duﬂo and Saez 2000, Sorensen 2002). There is an
expectation that individuals with similar characteristics
will face similar payoffs from engaging in comparable
activities (Ellison and Fudenberg 1993). Moreover, individuals may learn from those with whom they frequently
interact—a localized effect in which the ability to take
up a new activity is deﬁned by spatial and social proximity (Wright and Mischel 1987). Indeed, we expect that
knowledge spillovers will more easily ﬂow along corridors and beneﬁt those with frequent social interaction.
For scientists, both industrial and academic, local reference group or peer norms have been shown to play a signiﬁcant role in determining individual behavior (Kenney
and Goe 2004, Louis et al. 1989, Pelz and Andrews
1976, Stuart and Ding 2006).
We expect that individuals will be more likely to engage in technology transfer activities when they observe
individuals with similar characteristics in their departments disclosing. In academic communities, peer groups
commonly form based on professional rank within
departments. Social proximity in the work environment
is reinforced by spatial proximity. Having entered the
institution at a similar time, and facing similar issues in
managing their careers, those of similar rank tend to look
to each other for information, advice, and examples.
Hypothesis 4 (H4). Individuals are more likely to
disclose their inventions if their local peers engage in
technology transfer activities.
When facing pressure to adopt new organizational initiatives, individuals have a variety of response options. If
all of the inﬂuences are aligned, the choice appears to be
relatively simple: the individual will either participate, or
not, according to the inherent logic. However, when the
training effects and organization inﬂuence are opposed,
the individual faces trade-offs. A coherent response to
these mixed signals requires resolution that can occur
in one of two ways. First, individuals may resolve this

dissonance by updating their beliefs and wholeheartedly
responding to localized social inﬂuences. In this case,
they would either engage in disclosing or not, based on
the prevailing departmental logics. Second, those individuals who feel ambivalent about technology transfer
may respond symbolically—moderating their behavior
just enough to gain legitimacy. This suggests two additional hypotheses that investigate individual resolution
of these conﬂicting norms.
Dissonance. Individuals may be subjected to conﬂicting inﬂuences. Speciﬁcally, there may be tension
between beliefs instilled through professional imprinting (macro) and norms supported by local (micro) social
inﬂuences. According to dissonance theory, there is a
tendency for individuals to seek consistency in their
beliefs, attitudes, and behavior (Festinger 1957).14 Reconciling diverse exposures to select a particular behavior requires that individuals engage in intersubjective
sensemaking (Wiley 1988, Weick 1995). Sensemaking involves a conversational and narrative process that
is likely to be mediated between those with frequent
interaction (Gephart 1993, Balogun and Johnson 2005).
Because intensity of interaction with current peers is
likely to be greater than intensity of interaction with
those associated with previous professional situations, it
may be argued that dissonance will often be resolved
through conformation with the localized social norms
(Deutsch and Gerard 1955, Festinger 1957, Festinger
et al. 1950, Chattopadhyay et al. 1999).
Being subjected to conﬂicting inﬂuences is a common occurrence for faculty regarding technology transfer issues. For example, faculty members who trained at
universities with a strong technology transfer norm may
ﬁnd themselves in departments that do not actively pursue commercialization. Conversely, an individual who
trained under traditional norms may be situated with
peers who are actively engaged in technology transfer. Exposure to such mixed messages can create dissonance. As Owen-Smith and Powell (2001a, pp. 221,
137) note, faculty often hold contradictory values simultaneously, expressing some values that ﬁt with traditional Mertonian science, while other values ﬁt with the
new entrepreneurial norms. Dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, motivates the person to take
action to reduce the discord. This can be accomplished
by discounting the arguments of the group to rationalize
one’s established position or by altering current beliefs
to match those of the dominant group.
One of our interviews with an individual who had
been trained with the newer commercialization norms,
but had joined a department that followed the older academic norms, provided a clear example of dissonance.
This individual disclosed immediately after arriving on
campus but never disclosed subsequently. The initial disclosure is noteworthy as it converted to a patent, was

75

subsequently licensed and generated licensing revenue—
seemingly an outcome that would encourage additional
disclosure. This faculty member, having joined a department that did not value commercialization efforts, was
ﬁrmly told that patenting was not an appropriate activity for faculty in the department. While this individual
believed that ﬁling the disclosure was appropriate given
his prior training, he found himself at odds with the
expectations of his new position. This led him to question his initial position, and subsequently, he chose to
adhere to the values of his peer group, directing his
attention to the more traditional academic outlets.
Both the theoretical logic and our interviews suggest that localized social norms may trump the individual norms instilled via professional training when these
norms are in conﬂict. As such, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 5 (H5). When individuals are faced with
a situation where their individual training norms are not
congruent with the localized social norms in the work
environment, they will conform to the localized, rather
than individual, norms.
Symbolic Compliance. The individual decision to disclose inventions indicates compliance with the university’s technology transfer initiative. However, this
observed behavior may or may not indicate that the individual has adopted the new norms of behavior: They
may simply be going through the motions and complying at the minimum level. Alvesson and Willmott (1992)
ﬁnd that, in the face of new organization initiatives,
some employees experience what they term microemancipation, a genuine value reorientation, becoming almost
evangelical in their pursuit of the organizational initiative. This may be regarded as a substantive adoption of
new norms and signals a change in the individual’s attitude. However, it is also possible that social pressure
may induce only symbolic compliance: Some individuals may comply with organizational initiatives simply to
avoid sanctions (O’Reilly et al. 1991).15 For example, a
recent study of responses to new National Institutes of
Health (NIH) requirements for ethics training ﬁnds that
life science faculty take minimal action so as to appear
to follow the new guidelines while, in truth, resisting the
real change the initiative seeks (Smith-Doerr 2006).
Individuals who engage in symbolic compliance would
be expected to disclose nominally, perhaps only once
a period. In contrast, individuals who have undergone
microemancipation would disclose frequently. We expect
that these two groups may respond to different motives
in their disclosure decision. Substantive disclosers are
likely to be strongly inﬂuenced by peers as congruence between individual and organizational values is one
product of social identiﬁcation (O’Reilly and Chatman
1986). Symbolic disclosers, on the other hand, may
be less responsive to the localized pressure from their
cohort, but may be more inﬂuenced by the possibility

of organizational sanctions. Our interviews suggest that
symbolic individuals are more responsive to legal rules
and authority. Certainly, in our example, individuals with
NIH grants may engage in symbolic compliance to conform to agency guidelines. Further, we would expect
symbolic disclosers to take heed of the position of those
with authority to enforce the rules—in our context this
would be the department chair. Thus we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 6 (H6). Symbolic compliers will respond
more to formal organizational mandates than substantive adopters.

Data, Variables, and Methods

Our empirical analysis uses an original database compiled from administrative records at two prominent
research universities with medical schools. We have data
for faculty members across 15 matched departments in
the two medical schools for the academic years 1991–
1999. Our selection of departments was constrained by
the degree to which departments were present at both
universities. Under the advice of medical school faculty,
we selected closely aligned departments—that is, places
where similar work was being done despite slight differences in the name of the academic departments.
The 15 departments used in our analysis are presented
in Tables 1 and 2. We examined basic science departments such as cell biology, genetics, and immunology.
These are high-opportunity departments in which we
expect basic scientiﬁc discoveries that may easily lead
to invention disclosures. Our analysis also included a
set of clinical departments that provide primary patient
care and are oriented toward a speciﬁc specialty such
Table 2

as cardiology, ophthalmology, pediatrics, or psychiatry.
These departments include the largest number of medical school faculty. While the department names suggest
a primary focus on patient care, the expectation is that
faculty members also have an active research program.
Finally, our selection included departments such as anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, and surgery that are
oriented toward providing patient services and are ancillary to other departments. These departments are termed
nexus departments. Our interviews suggest that faculty
in these departments may be in a position to engage
in greater inventive activity because they consult with
multiple departments and may have more opportunity
to learn from other faculty members. In addition, our
interviews suggest that nexus departments have a practical problem-solving focus that promotes user-deﬁned
inventions.
Table 2 demonstrates the great variation in the rank of
faculty members who disclose in each department.16 For
example, at University A Medical School, nearly half
of the junior faculty in Pharmacology disclosed in the
three-year period, while only about a quarter of senior
faculty disclosed. Yet, in the Genetics Department, all
senior faculty members disclosed, while only just over
a quarter of junior faculty members disclosed. Table 2
provides information on department chairs who had disclosures in the prior time period. At University A Medical School, 9 of the 15 chairs had a history of disclosing,
while 7 of the 15 chairs had a history of disclosing at
University B.
We model the probability of disclosing in the current
time period as a function of activity observed during the
prior time period. We have a simple two-period model.
The decision to ﬁle disclosures at time t is a function of

individual attributes and the behavior of the local cohort
observed in the time period, t − 1. Our dependent variable indicates disclosure activity in the academic year
1996–1997 through the academic year 1998–1999. We
used a three-year window to track disclosures, chosen to
capture a reasonable time period during which an individual faculty member might have results to disclose.
The dependent variable is equal to zero if the individual did not ﬁle an invention disclosure in the three-year
window for 1996–1998. The dependent variable is equal
to one if the individual ﬁled one or more invention disclosures. The probability of disclosing is estimated using
a probit model (Maddala 1983).
The independent variables are measured for the prior
time period, academic year 1991–1992 through academic year 1995–1996. This study period reﬂects a time
of relative stability in terms of technology transfer policies at both institutions. Both TTOs opened in the late
1980s and had become established by 1991. Personnel
records, university course catalogues and archival data
were used to build records for faculty members. Data on
disclosures are from the records of the TTOs at the two
universities.
To test our hypothesis, we ﬁrst estimate the training,
leadership, and cohort effects on the observed ﬁling of
disclosures. We use three variables to investigate training effects. The ﬁrst two variables capture the technology transfer culture of the institution where the faculty
member received their graduate training. Certain universities have historically had greater receptiveness to,
and greater involvement in, technology transfer activities
than others. The intensity of a university’s technology
transfer culture can be proxied using the institution’s
patenting history (Mowery and Ziedonis 2002). We calculate the total number of patents applied for by an individual’s graduate institution in the ﬁve years preceding
the date of the faculty member’s graduate degree. This
is intended to capture the activity at the time that the
individual was in training at the institution. To the extent
that individuals’ attitudes toward technology transfer are
inﬂuenced by norms that they are exposed to during
training, we expect that individuals educated at universities active in patenting will have a greater predisposition
toward technology transfer, ceteras paribus. Stanford,
mentioned several times in faculty interviews, stands out
as a well-known example of a protechnology transfer
university with a strong history of patenting activity. As
such, we code a Stanford dummy variable equal to one if
an individual has an advanced degree from Stanford, as
a simple alternative measure of protechnology transfer
imprinting.
Our third measure of protechnology transfer exposure
explicitly captures the era in which the faculty member
was trained. As noted earlier, the acceptance of technology transfer activities at most universities has increased
substantially over the past few decades. To capture the

77

timing effect associated with the individual’s training, or
experience years, we measure the number of years since
the faculty member received their last advanced degree.
To explore the inﬂuence of key leadership on faculty’s propensity to disclose, we include a dummy variable indicating whether or not the chair has disclosed an
invention to the TTO in the 1991–1995 time period. This
variable is coded 1 for yes, and 0 for no. It should be
noted that the chairs of the medical school departments
typically hold this leadership position for extended periods of time and there was no turnover in the chair in
any of the departments during the period studied. We
deﬁne an individual’s cohort as those individuals of the
same rank in the same department. The cohort effect is
measured as the percentage of faculty at the same rank
within the department who disclosed in the 1991–1995
time period.17
We include several control variables in the estimation.
First, academic scientists may only ﬁle disclosures when
they have results to disclose. Research productivity will
matter. To control for this variation, we collected data on
the total numbers of publications in the 1991–1995 time
period for each of the scientists in our database using ISI
Web of Science. Next, disclosure behavior may be inﬂuenced by the quality of the individual faculty member
and the overall quality of the department. One measure
of academic quality is research awards from NIH, which
is the most prominent source of medical school and life
sciences funding in the world. These research awards
are highly competitive and may be interpreted as a sign
of ability to conduct high-quality research. To control
for the potential effect of individual ability, we include
a dollar measure of NIH funding received by each faculty member in the previous time period. To control for
departmental quality, we use the amount of NIH funding received by the department in 1998, normalized by
department size.18
In addition, we also include two controls for individual inventive capacity. Entrepreneurial research has
shown that individuals with interdisciplinary educational
backgrounds are better positioned to recognize, and then
act upon, innovation opportunities (Venkataraman 1997,
Shane 2000). One sign of a breadth of knowledge is the
subsequent appointment of a faculty member to multiple
departments. As such, we include a boundary-spanning
dummy variable, coded 1, if the faculty member is
associated with more than one academic department.
A second indication of breadth of knowledge is the
attainment of multiple graduate degrees. Individuals who
hold both a Ph.D. and an M.D. are expected to have
training that encompasses research and practical application. In this respect, they may be in an advantageous
position to develop new inventions with an eye to the
commercial potential. Thus we include a dummy variable, coded as 1, to capture those individuals having both
M.D.’s and Ph.D.’s. We also control for the number of

previous disclosures for each faculty member; we expect
those individuals who have disclosed in the past to likely
continue this behavior.
As a rough measure of technical opportunity, we
include dummy variables to control for department type,
basic science and nexus, with clinical as the omitted
variable. We add rank dummy variables to control for
faculty rank and a non-U.S. dummy to capture the
effects of having been trained at a foreign institution.
Finally, we include a university dummy variable to control for heterogeneity between the two TTOs and other
institutional differences between the two universities.
To test H5, the effect of dissonance, we include a set
of independent variables to consider how the individual’s
training experience may be situated in a local environment. According to the matrix in Figure 1, there are four
potential combinations depending on whether the individual had been exposed to technology transfer norms
during his or her professional training and whether the
individual was part of a cohort that was active in disclosing. In the two groups along the diagonal, the training norms and local norms are aligned (Cells I and IV),
and in the other two groups, these norms are in conﬂict
(Cells II and III).
To characterize the local work environment, we consider cohort participation in the prior time period.19 The
mean cohort participation was 0.176 with a standard
deviation of 0.154. We used the mean plus one standard deviation as the threshold for a sufﬁcient number of
individuals participating in tech transfer to create a local
work environment that favored the new norms of active
technology transfer. If one-third or more of the cohort
participated in tech transfer, we consider the local work
environment to be favorable toward technology transfer. If less than one-third of the cohort participated, then
the traditional norms prevail. There were 206 individuals 25 + 181 in cohorts where technology transfer had
gained traction.
Next, to characterize the individual’s training environment, we use patenting activity at the graduate institution in the ﬁve years while the individual was training.

The range was from 0 to 114, a highly skewed distribution with a mean of 5.33 and a standard deviation of
9.96. To provide sufﬁcient representation in each quadrant, the threshold used to characterize protech transfer
training environments was 19 patents at the graduate
institution (mean + 15 standard deviations). There were
147 25 + 122 individuals who trained with protech
transfer norms.
The majority of the academics are aligned toward the
traditional norms. Cell IV, individuals whose training
and social situation are aligned and provide no incentive
to engage in invention disclosure, is the most populous
in the database. Cell I, the protech transfer alignment
cell, has the fewest members. These 25 individuals both
trained with tech transfer norms and were located in
cohorts that were actively disclosing, reﬂecting an alignment of training and local environment. As expected,
virtually all of these individuals disclosed and were
among the most active disclosers in our study. Both cells
that reﬂect individuals facing dissonance are populated
at a moderate level. Cell III captures individuals who
trained with the newer norms of academic entrepreneurship, but now face local cohorts who are not actively
engaged in technology transfer. We coded dummy variables to reﬂect which quadrant the individual inhabited.
To test H6, the differences between symbolic and
substantive disclosers, we deﬁne new dependent variables. Symbolic is a dummy variable equal to one for
those individuals who disclosed once in the current time
period and had no more than one disclosure in the previous time period. Substantive is a dummy variable equal
to one if the individual had more than one disclosure
in the current time period. There were 168 symbolic
individuals and 136 individuals who were considered
substantive.
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3 and correlations are in Table 4. Correlations are generally low
to moderate. Multicollinearity is generally not a problem
for the estimations.

Results

Table 5 provides results for medical school faculty members in the selected departments at the two medical
schools.20 Model (1) provides a baseline model. The
number of publications in the prior time period has a
positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on the propensity to disclose in the current time period p < 001.
This ﬁnding, in line with prior research, suggests that
commercialization activity and traditional academic publication activity are complementary (Powell and OwenSmith 1998, Stuart and Ding 2006, Zucker et al. 1998).
Each additional publication increases the likelihood of
disclosing by 0.1%. The number of disclosures in the
prior time period also has a strong and statistically signiﬁcant effect on the propensity to disclose in the current time period. This is, of course, to be expected as

individuals tend to repeat established behaviors. Those
who have previously disclosed are likely to continue this
behavior if the experience was reasonable. Interestingly,
the amount of individual NIH funding is not statistically signiﬁcant in this estimation. Individual quality, as
captured by individual NIH awards, does not appear to
play a deterministic role in promoting disclosure activity. However, we do ﬁnd that department quality, as
captured by departmental NIH awards, is positively and
signiﬁcantly related to disclosure activity p < 001.
Faculty members from higher quality academic departments are more likely to participate in technology transfer activities. Faculty trained outside the United States
are also signiﬁcantly more likely to disclose inventions
than those trained in the United States p < 0001. This
ﬁnding is consistent with other studies that document
high levels of entrepreneurial activity in many immigrant
communities (Aldrich 1999, Saxenian 2002).
Measures of training breadth also contribute explanatory power. First, the coefﬁcient on the dual-degree
dummy variable is positive and signiﬁcant p < 0001.
Individuals having earned both an M.D. and a Ph.D.
show a greater propensity to disclose than colleagues
with single degrees. Holding both degrees increases
the probability of disclosing by 13%. We also ﬁnd a
strong positive relationship between occupying a boundary position at the medical school and the likelihood of
disclosure. Boundary spanning individuals, those with
appointments in more than one academic department,
are 4% more likely to disclose. Faculty in basic science

and nexus departments are signiﬁcantly more likely to
disclose than faculty in clinical departments, the omitted category. This may reﬂect the more patient-oriented
nature of departments like pediatrics and psychiatry,
however, it should be noted that individuals in these
departments do disclose inventions, and the expectation
at prominent medical schools is that all faculty conduct
research. Academic rank, using the rank of associate
professor as the omitted category, is not statistically signiﬁcant in this speciﬁcation. Finally, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences between the two universities.
Model (2) builds on the basic speciﬁcation by adding
the training (social imprinting) variables. The explanatory power of the model increases signiﬁcantly with
the addition of the independent variables of theoretical
interest. A likelihood ratio test comparing Model (2) to
Model (1) is signiﬁcant with a p-value less than 0.01.
Experience years, calculated as the number of years
since the last graduate degree, is negatively and signiﬁcantly related to participation in technology transfer p < 0001: the probability of disclosing decreases
by 1% for each year since the completion of graduate study. This result, which supports H2, indicates that
the earlier an individual completed her training, the less
likely she was to pursue commercialization opportunities. Model (2) also adds in the inﬂuence of completing
graduate training at historically protechnology transfer
institutions. The coefﬁcient on the institution patent
activity variable is positive and signiﬁcant p < 005.

where an individual received his or her graduate training is associated with a 0.2% increase in the probability that the individual will disclose. In Model (3),
we use the alternative measure of protechnology culture imprinting—receiving a graduate degree from Stanford. The effect of training at Stanford University, an
institution that is particularly protechnology transfer was
mentioned in several interviews. The coefﬁcient on the
Stanford degree dummy is positive and signiﬁcant. Holding a Stanford degree increases the probability of engaging in technology transfer by 27%, all other things being

equal. Thus, H1 is also supported: individuals whose
graduate training incorporated technology transfer objectives are more likely to disclose inventions.
Though generally consistent, there is one noteworthy change to the control variables between Model (1)
and Models (2) and (3). With the addition of the social
imprinting variables, the rank controls become signiﬁcant with full professors more likely, and assistant professors less likely to disclose, as compared to associate
professors. These results are in line with the human capital argument that those individuals who are well estab-

lished in their academic careers will be more likely to
leverage their reputations for commercial gain (Stephan
and Levin 1992).
Model (4) investigates the effect of the chair’s disclosing behavior and ﬁnds some evidence of a leadership
effect p < 005. It appears that, to a signiﬁcant degree,
individual faculty model their technology transfer behavior on the example set by their department chair. As
shown in Model (4), if the chair has disclosed any inventions to the TTO in the past ﬁve years, then the probability that the faculty member will disclose increases
by 4%. Thus, H3 also receives initial support. Model (5)
considers the inﬂuence an individual’s cohort has on disclosure activity. The coefﬁcient on the cohort variable
is positive and signiﬁcant (p < 005), suggesting that an
individual’s disclosure choice is swayed by the actions of
those of similar rank within the department, as predicted
by H4. We ﬁnd that a 1% increase in the percentage
of faculty disclosing within the relevant cohort increases
the probability of an individual disclosing by 12%.
Model (5) includes all independent variables of interest. The coefﬁcients remain consistent for most variables, however, the chair effect is no longer statistically
signiﬁcant. This may be because of multicolinearity
between the cohort and chair variables (rho = 048). The
effect of cohort appears to dominate over the inﬂuence
of the chair.
Robustness Checks. Though the result in Model (5)
is supportive of a local peer effect, it is possible that
this ﬁnding arises because of shared unobserved characteristics of the department. Common unobservables
could lead to commonality of behavior without imitation
(Bikhchandani et al. 1992). Manski (2000) notes that one

problem that plagues social learning research is unobserved heterogeneity, the ability to distinguish endogenous interactions from correlated effects. To investigate
this issue, we ran an additional model that includes
an other cohort variable, those individuals in the same
department but of a different rank, as well as the own
cohort variable. Speciﬁcally, in Model (6), we investigate
whether an individual’s disclosure decision is differentially inﬂuenced by the actions of individuals inside versus outside the focal cohort. Under this speciﬁcation, the
coefﬁcient for own cohort remains positive and signiﬁcant, while the coefﬁcient for the other cohort variable,
although positive, does not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
Finding that only own cohort effects are important indicates that social learning, rather than departmental unobserved variables, is driving our results.
The results hold when we include departmental ﬁxed
effects. Table 6 estimates the model with departmental
ﬁxed effects. Fourteen academic departments are listed
with surgery as the omitted department.
As a further robustness check, we estimate a negative binomial model with the count of the number of
disclosures in the second time period, as the dependent
variable. The number of current disclosures ranged from
0 to 36, with overdispersion (mean = 039 and standard
deviation = 148). Table 7 demonstrates that the basic
effects hold for the number of disclosures that an individual ﬁles.
An alternate explanation for our ﬁndings could be that
selection, rather than socialization, drives the departmental results. Speciﬁcally, it could be argued that instead
of being inﬂuenced by the action of leaders and peers,
individuals predisposed to technology transfer are hired
in departments supportive of this activity. To test for

selection effects, we looked at the 190 individuals that
were hired by either of the two universities in 1991, the
ﬁrst year of our panel. If selection was, in fact, a dominant determinant of the disclosure dynamic, we would
expect to ﬁnd evidence that department chairs with a
history of disclosure would want to encourage technology transfer activity and might hire individuals whose
training suggested that they might be more inclined to
engage in commercial activity. An independent samples
t test showed that there was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference (t = 1605; p > 010) in the likelihood that an
individual having a dual (both Ph.D. and M.D.) degree
would be hired into a department in which the chair
actively disclosed, versus a department with a chair who
did not participate in technology transfer activities. Similarly, in a second independent samples t test, the hypothesis that the means of the patenting activity of the new
hires’ graduate institutions were equal across departments, led by technology transfer active versus nonactive
chairs, could not be rejected (t = 1638; p > 010).
As an additional test for selection effects, we ran the
analysis on faculty who earned their degree prior to
1980 and joined the faculty prior to 1985. Before the
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, neither university in our sample had active technology transfer programs—though both established TTOs in the late 1980s.
Because the schools did not operate with commercialization intent prior to 1985, there is little risk that before
this point new faculty were selected based on being pre-

disposed toward disclosing. Thus, if we restrict our sample to those hired before technology transfer became an
organizational initiative, we can reduce the concern that
our ﬁndings reﬂect selection rather than socialization.
When we run the analysis on this subset, we ﬁnd that
training and cohort effects remain statistically signiﬁcant
in the expected direction.
Dissonance. Table 8 presents results for faculty members facing conﬂicting norms. Model (1) is a probit
model with the dependent variable of current disclosure
that we have used previously. We run our basic speciﬁcation with dummy variables for those individuals who
have not been trained with tech transfer norms but now
ﬁnd themselves in an active technology transfer cohort
(pressured), and those individuals who have been trained
with technology transfer norms but are now in inactive
cohorts (leading edge), as deﬁned in Figure 1. Given

that the categories were constructed using cohort and
graduate institution information, we do not include these
variables in the model. There are 25 individuals whose
training and cohort activity are aligned with the new
norms. We dropped this group from estimation to allow a
comparison of individuals in conﬂict against those individuals whose training and cohort activity are aligned
with the traditional academic norms.21 Thus our omitted
category is category IV in Figure 1.
The basic results for the control variables are consistent with our earlier models. We ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient
on the leading-edge dummy variable is positive but not
statistically signiﬁcant. This indicates that those individuals who trained with the new norms, but do not face
localized social norms in support of such behavior, revert
to the traditional norms and are not differentiated from
those individuals in the reference category of traditional
norms. The coefﬁcient on the pressured dummy variable is positive and statistically signiﬁcant p < 010.
Individuals who are not trained to the new commercialization norms but who work under localized social
norms favoring the new activity are more likely to disclose than those individuals with a similar training who
do not face this pressure. Indeed, location in an active
cohort increases propensity to disclose by 5%, holding
other variables constant.
Model (2) is a negative binomial with the count
of current disclosures. Again, the control variables are
consistent with our robustness check. As in Model (1),
leading-edge individuals do not disclose at a greater
rate than our reference group—those aligned toward the
traditional academic norms. Those individuals who are
under pressure to disclose, translate this into a higher
and statistically signiﬁcant level of disclosing. These
results suggest that individuals are more responsive to
immediate local social pressure than previous professional training.
Symbolic Behavior. Table 9 provides the results of the
analysis of the symbolic and substantive adopters of the
organizational technology transfer initiative. Symbolic,
equal to one for those individuals who disclosed once
in the current time period and had no more than one
disclosure in the previous time period, is the dependent
variable in Models (1)–(3). Substantive, equal to one if
the individual had more than one disclosure in the current time period, is the dependent variable for Models
(4)–(6).
The models build sequentially and follow the same
logic for symbolic and substantive disclosers. Models
(1) and (4) include the full slate of control variables and
the inﬂuence of leader activity. Models (2) and (5) add
in the inﬂuence of cohort disclosures in the prior time
period. Models (3) and (6) include the effect of other
cohort disclosures as a robustness check.

In support of H6, we ﬁnd that symbolic and substantive disclosers appear to respond to different inﬂuences. The dollar amount of individual NIH awards is
positive and strongly statistically signiﬁcant p < 0001
for individuals who engage in symbolic disclosing.
This suggests that individuals who engage in symbolic
compliance are following the rules as dictated by NIH
guidelines. Similarly, the activity of the department chair
is also signiﬁcantly associated with symbolic compliance. Neither individual NIH funding, nor chair activity, is statistically signiﬁcant for individuals who appear
to have internalized the new norms as seen in Models (4)–(6). In contrast, the substantive disclosers appear
to be more responsive to local social norms. The coefﬁcient on the cohort variable is positive and statistically
signiﬁcant p < 0001. Thus the disclosure behavior
of the two groups appears to be subject to different inﬂuences. Substantive disclosers are more strongly
inﬂuenced by their local peer groups, an illustration
of the link between individual and organization values
reﬂecting strong social identiﬁcation. The inﬂuence of
a non-U.S. degree, or status as a dual-degree holder,
is statistically signiﬁcant in the substantive regressions,
while not signiﬁcant for the symbolic individuals.

Discussion and Reﬂective Conclusions

The process of organizational change is neither straightforward nor simple. This challenge is exacerbated when
the organization itself is embedded within a thick institutional context (Meyer and Rowan 1977, DiMaggio
and Powell 1983). Certainly, this is the case in our
study. University medical schools, like other academic
settings, constitute an organizational ﬁeld that is highly
institutionalized and seen as resistant to change. The
Mertonian norms of open science have long provided the
archetype or template for academics and academic institutions (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). When the external
environment changed because of a convergence of legal,
political, and economic factors, an alternative archetype
of academic entrepreneurship was articulated. The emergence of this alternative template was the ﬁrst step, but
not a sufﬁcient condition for institutional or organizational change (Greenwood and Hinings 1993). Attempts
to increase university interaction with industry and facilitate the commercialization of academic research have
been ongoing for almost 25 years. Although virtually
all universities have created formal TTOs, policies, and
procedures, there have been great variations in realized commercial activity. Rather than solely a function of resources, these organizational outcomes appear
to reﬂect differences in the organization’s ability to
move away from the older, more established norms and
embrace new norms of academic entrepreneurship.
Understanding the roots of this difference requires a
greater focus on intraorganizational dynamics, as organizations are heterogeneous entities composed of differentiated groups. This study explores individual actions in

the organizational context to understand the link between
intraorganizational dynamics and organizational change.
Speciﬁcally, we examine participation in university technology transfer as a new organizational initiative. Our
work relies on tracking a large sample of individuals,
examining their backgrounds and work environments,
and following their invention disclosure activities, which
signal their engagement with academic entrepreneurship. We ﬁnd that adoption of the new initiative by
individuals may be either substantive or symbolic. Our
results suggest that individual attributes, while impor-

tant, are conditioned by the local work environment.
In terms of personal attributes, individuals are more
likely to disclose inventions if they trained at institutions that have long established and relatively successful technology transfer operations. In addition, we ﬁnd
that the longer the elapsed time since graduate training, the less likely the faculty member was to actively
embrace the new commercialization norm. Considering
the localized social environment, we ﬁnd that when the
chair of the department is active in technology transfer,
other members of the department are also likely to dis-

close, if only for symbolic reasons. We also ﬁnd that
technology transfer behavior is calibrated by the experience of those in a similar position, in terms of academic rank and departmental afﬁliation. If individuals
can observe others at their academic rank disclosing,
then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance, other things being equal. Finally, when individuals face dissonance, a situation where their individual training norms are not congruent with the localized
social norms in their work environment, they will conform to the localized norms rather than sticking with the
norms from their prior experience.
Our results imply that social learning and local context inﬂuence an individual’s decision to follow strategic
initiatives and participate in new activities. However, we
do not interpret these results as justifying the conclusion
that selection plays no role in the adoption dynamic.
Rather, both selection and socialization may be material
in promoting organizational change (Kraatz and Moore
2002). The challenge for future research is to disentangle the contributions of these alternative drivers to better
understand under what circumstances one is likely more
pertinent than the other. Another challenge is clarifying
what individuals speciﬁcally learn through social interactions. The decision to accept the institution’s strategic
initiative and actively participate in technology transfer may be driven by the legitimization of the practice
that comes from the internalization of local behavioral
norms. On the other hand, the decision to disclose may
reﬂect a lowering of the cost to the faculty member of
adopting this organizational innovation, because of the
enhanced operational knowledge gained through exposure to the process. Our interviews suggest that both factors have been inﬂuential. However, the question remains
as to whether the message received differs systematically across individuals, and/or over time, and how this
affects the diffusion of the initiative. Future research that
investigates these issues is clearly warranted.
In sum, introducing strategic initiatives requires thinking creatively about the process of organizational change
and the inﬂuence of microorganizational social processes. Although the academic environment is unique in
many respects, the ﬁndings of this study should have
value for other organizations attempting to embrace new
initiatives. Our study provides insights into the multilevel attributes of the change process, the importance
of departmental (or subunit) composition and localized
learning in promoting organizational change, and the
tensions faced, and the response mechanisms employed,
when individuals are subject to new expectations. Individual characteristics matter. However, they alone are not
fully deterministic, as individuals respond to leaders and
their local context. Even if subunit leaders do not participate in the strategic initiatives, this is not an insurmountable obstacle, as individuals may adopt the new behavior
when they are able to observe their peers participating.

The importance of localized learning through interaction with cohorts of similar individuals is provocative
and suggests that internal conﬁguration within the organization matters. Promoting new initiatives may be more
likely when individuals are concentrated in the same
work units, and thus able to support each other.
Additional insight can be gained, and prescriptions
offered, by considering the role of dissonance and symbolic compliance in the change process. Individuals
have multiple motives in their job performance and the
management of their careers. Individuals facing conﬂicting norms may resolve discord by reverting to the
prevalent localized norms. The need for a concentration in cohort activity, in combination with the potential reversion of leading-edge individuals, exacerbates
the challenge of promoting organizational change. However, the option of symbolic disclosure suggests a potential strategy: An early emphasis on, and enforcement
of, organizational rules may be beneﬁcial in forestalling
reversion to the prevailing norms, while also generating new symbolic compliers. In turn, this may create
a critical mass that legitimizes the new initiative and
provides the traction necessary to convert previously
symbolic compliers into substantive compliers. Through
this process organizational initiatives may be successfully realized, as the new archetype becomes the dominant norm. Our results suggest that successfully adopting
strategic initiatives requires understanding organization
heterogeneity, subunit dynamics, and the factors that
inﬂuence individual compliance. This is suggestive of a
more bottoms-up approach to organizational change and
may mean rethinking how resources are allocated when
implementing new initiatives.

cash ﬂow, as the licensing ﬁrm is then required to cover the
patenting costs.
4
Other individuals, such as staff, graduate students, and postdoctorates may disclose inventions, but this is a small percentage of activity. Disclosures that do involve nonfaculty
are likely to have at least one faculty member listed as an
inventor.
5
The number of faculty members who have ﬁled invention disclosures captures those who have disclosed in the three-year
period, 1996–1998. This does not correspond directly to the
absolute count of disclosures because more than one faculty
member may be listed on a single disclosure. If a faculty member appeared on an invention disclosure, they are counted as
having ﬁled a disclosure.
6
We use the term invention disclosure events to capture the
number of times that an individual was listed on an invention
disclosure.
7
We conducted more than 50 interviews with technology transfer ofﬁcials, university administrators, and faculty members as
background for this study.
8
Departments may sweeten the deal by distributing a share
of their third of the royalties to the inventing faculty members’ lab. This practice was ﬁrst used to encourage technology
transfer; however, it is now a well-established practice across
departments at both universities.
9
In a similar vein, Finnemore and Sikkink (1998, p. 905)
argue: “Professional training does more than simply transfer
technical knowledge; it actively socializes people to value certain things above others.”
10
In another context, Schewe and Meredith (1994) highlight
vintage effects showing that an individual’s attitude toward
jobs, money, and savings is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the
conditions encountered when the individual ﬁrst becomes an
“economic adult.”
11
This was mentioned as a problem in several interviews.
While the university may promote technology transfer, if the
department has not embraced it, then the individual will face
difﬁculties. There is no hard and fast rule for evaluating technology transfer activity relative to academic work. We have
been told that the MIT electrical engineering department values a patent as much as an academic article in a high-quality
journal, although there does not appear to be any quantiﬁcation of these trade-offs at the two universities examined here
(Agrawal and Henderson 2002).
12
The chair has a role in hiring decisions and could select individuals with similar technology transfer attitudes. Interview
evidence revealed that criteria other than technology transfer
are more important in hiring decisions. Robustness tests were
conducted to conﬁrm that selection biases were not signiﬁcant
in this context. These tests are described in detail in the results
section of the paper.
13
In sum, faculty use social cues to discern what type of behavior to pursue. This process is not inconsistent with individual
utility maximization.
14
Festinger considered the social group as an important source
of dissonance noting, “The open expression of disagreement
in a group leads to the existence of cognitive dissonance in the
members. The knowledge that some other person, generally
like oneself, holds one opinion is dissonant with holding a
contrary opinion.” (Festinger 1957, pp. 261–262).

15

This type of symbolic response by an individual is akin
to the adoption of symbolic structures by organizations in
response to changes in the legal environment (Edelman 1990,
1992). The actions chosen may be those that confer legitimacy
while being minimally disruptive to the status quo.
16
A paired sample t-test of the equivalence of the percentage
of faculty reveals that there are statistically signiﬁcant differences at the two institutions (t = −2441, 44 d.f.).
17
We used the rank of the faculty member in 1993, the midpoint of the ﬁrst period, to construct the cohort variables.
Given the relatively long tenure process in medical schools, we
ﬁnd that few faculty members in the database changed ranks
in the 1991–1995 period. Results are robust to using alternative anchors such as the rank at the beginning or end of the
time period.
18
The Association of American Medical Colleges uses NIH
funding to differentiate quality among departments across
schools. http://www.aamc.org/medicalschools.htm.
19
When the faculty is segmented by cohort and training, there
is not substantial variation among the disclosure behavior of
the chair in the study time period. Unfortunately, there was not
enough variation to consider the three-way conﬂict between
training, cohort, and leadership effects.
20
The sample size varies from the total reported in Table 1
because of missing data and movement of faculty.
21
This yields 1,755 observations for our estimation in Table 8.
