Technology strategy (TS) is one of the most important aspects of any firm’s
strategic posture especially in dynamic environments such as the computer
software industry. Not only do new ventures face the pressures that accompany all young companies (e.g., shortages of capital), but they also have to
keep up with a rapid rate of technological change. Consequently TS, the sum
of a firm’s choices on how to develop and exploit its technological resources,
can profoundly affect a venture’s performance and survival.
This empirical study examines the relationships between TS and new venture performance (NVP).
By focusing on TS variables and analyzing their performance outcomes, the study offers insights into
the factors that can influence the success of new ventures in a fast-paced environment. This study also
examines key environmental moderators, those external environmental forces, which can significantly
impact the strength or direction of the relationship between a firm’s TS and NVP.

The study examines five TSs that can enhance NPV. The first is radicality, which means developing
and introducing new products ahead of competitors. The second is the intensity of product upgrades,
which refers to a venture’s commitment to introducing more refinements and extensions of its products
than its competition. The third is the level of R&D spending, which indicates a venture’s strong investment
in internal research and development activities. The fourth is the use of external technology sources (e.g.,
strategic alliances and licenses) to augment a firm’s own R&D efforts. The final dimension is the use of
copyrights and other means of protecting the venture’s intellectual property.
Environmental moderators examined in this paper were: dynamism, price hostility, non-price hostility, and heterogeneity. Dynamism reflects the rate and continuity of change within an industry. Price
hostility indicates the intensity of rivalry in an industry based on costs and reduced prices. Non-price
hostility indicates an emphasis on product quality and service as the key to success in an industry. Heterogeneity indicates the diversity of the market segments in the new venture’s industry; a heterogeneous environment typically has multiple segments with diverse needs and expectations.
To test the impact of environmental moderators on the efficacy of TS, data were collected from
116 U.S.-based software firms. NVP was measured by return on equity (ROE) and growth of market
share (GMS). Overall, the results show that not all of the TS dimensions had a significant effect on NVP,
and that the relationships of these dimensions with NVP were moderated by the venture’s perceptions
of the external environment. Three dimensions of TS were associated with both ROE and GMS: radical
new products, frequent product upgrades, and the use of external technology sources. Further, only frequent product upgrades had a significant impact under all four moderating conditions on both NVP
measures. New product radicality enhances both performance variables in dynamic environments; beyond that, it only has a significant negative interaction with price hostility. R&D, however, is generally
not associated with strong short-term ROE performance except in heterogeneous environments. Yet, for
GMS, R&D is a significant variable except under dynamism. External technology sources also have a
strong association with NVP, being insignificant only in the case of GMS in situations of non-price hostility. Finally, the use of copyrights, patents and other means of protecting the company’s intellectual capital
is generally not associated with NVP under different environmental conditions. In a dynamic environment, copyrights (and other means of intellectual property protection) appear to speed up the diffusion
of knowledge to rivals and therefore may not enhance venture performance.
The results also suggest that new ventures should pursue a formal technology strategy to achieve
successful performance. Those ventures that match their technological choices with their external environments are better positioned to achieve superior performance.  1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Technology plays a major role in determining the success of new ventures (Zahra 1996).
Technology, the sum of a firm’s knowledge and skills, determine the ability of new ventures to offer the products (services), gain market acceptance, survive, and achieve financial success. To develop effective technology strategy, executives need to analyze
their ventures’ competitive setting, (Bettis and Hitt 1995). This is important because
although some technological capabilities can improve performance within certain environments, the same choices may lower performance in other environments (Iansiti 1995;
Kodama 1995). The external environment, therefore, can moderate the relationship between a firm’s technological choices and its performance (Kerin, Varadarajan, and Peterson 1992). Consequently, to be successful, a venture’s technology strategy (TS)
should be “customized” to match the conditions of its environment. Currently, there
is little evidence on the nature of this moderating effect and how it impacts a firm’s
performance, a factor that has invited calls for empirical studies on this issue (e.g., Miller
1988; Zahra 1996).
To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines how new ventures’ external

<-----Page 2----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

137

environments may moderate the relationship between their TS and performance in the
U.S. software industry. Understanding this relationship is important because of the ventures’ major role in creating technologies and giving life to growth industries such as
software. New ventures, defined as firms that have been in existence for eight years
or less (Zahra 1996), also make significant contributions to the economic progress of
the U.S.
TS is important for new ventures’ market survival and financial success. Developing
new technologies, even breakthrough ones, is rarely sufficient to survive and achieve
market success (McGrath 1994). New ventures, therefore, need also to employ effective
technological strategies that allow them to financially benefit from their innovations
(McGee, Dowling, and Meggison 1995). Presently, the contributions of a comprehensive TS to a venture’s profitability and growth are not well documented (Lefebvre et
al. 1992; Zahra 1996), a gap in the literature this study hopes to fill.
The remainder of this paper consists of three sections. First, the importance of understanding the relationship between a venture’s environment and its TS is discussed.
Next, hypotheses on the specific links between the dimensions of the venture’s external
environment, TS, and NVP are developed. This is followed by an empirical study that
tested the hypotheses in the U.S. software industry. The study’s findings and their implications for managerial practice and future research are discussed in the final section
of the paper.

THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Technological capabilities are among the most recognized determinants of the success
of new ventures (McGrath 1994), as they allow these firms to pursue those strategic
options that can best maximize their chances for survival and achieve superior performance (Zahra 1996). Developing these technological capabilities requires managers to
formulate and implement a TS based on the venture’s organizational and financial resources, market orientation (Dowling and McGee 1994), competitive goals (Zahra and
Covin 1993), and external environment. This paper focuses on the relationship between
a venture’s external environment and its TS. Though the exact nature of this relationship
remains unclear (Grant 1995), new ventures are usually more vulnerable to their industries’ conditions than their established rivals. The evolution of the ventures’ technological capabilities is also influenced by their external environments (Anderson and Tushman 1990; Pisano 1990). As new ventures analyze their industries, they usually become
aware of the opportunities and threats that exist in their markets. Successful ventures
are expected to invest in developing those technological capabilities that best position
them in their industry (Nelson 1995). Therefore, this paper explores the impact of new
ventures’ external environment when selecting their TS is therefore an important research issue.
Managers’ perceptions of the external environment are expected to moderate the
relationship between a venture’s TS and its financial performance. This means that the
interactions of the environment with TS are expected to be significantly related to NVP.
To maximize NVP, therefore, managers need to pursue technology strategies that best
match the conditions of their firms’ external environments. This is exceedingly difficult
because different dimensions of the ventures’ environments often impose conflicting
demands on these young companies. Through the direct relationship between the external environment and company performance has been the subject of much discussion in

<-----Page 3----->138

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

the literature (Boyd et al. 1993; Dess and Beard 1994), there is agreement that mangers’
perceptions of their firm’s environment significantly influences company performance
(Grant 1995). Consequently, this study extends the literature by exploring the moderating effect impact of the environment on the TS-NVP relationship.

TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY
There are five key dimensions of a new venture’s TS. Table 1 defines these dimensions
and explains their importance for successful performance. Although the relationships
between these dimensions are not well understood, some of these dimensions appear to
be mutually supportive. For example, companies that spend heavily on R&D frequently
introduce more products to their markets, often develop radically innovative products,
and frequently obtain more patents and copyrights (see Buzzell and Gale 1987). One
must be cautious, however, in making broad generalizations about the nature of the
associations among the five TS dimensions. For example, heavy investments in R&D
may not always lead to frequent product introductions as internal bureaucratic inefficiencies, poor selection of research projects, and lack of attention to technology commercialization can weaken the venture’s ability to develop or market such products.
Thus, several factors can confound the pattern of associations among a venture’s TS
dimensions and significantly impact their associations with NVP. This study, therefore,
explores the moderating effect of the relationship between a venture’s external environment and five key TS dimensions. This examination offers a basis for understanding
the interactions between the dimensions of a new venture’s TS variables.

PERCEPTIONS OF NEW VENTURE’S
ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS
The study focuses on how managers’ perceptions of the external environment can moderate the relationship of the TS dimensions with NVP. Although these perceptions do
not always reflect what is seen as one “objective” characteristic of the environment
(Boyd et al. 1993), they are the interpretation that direct the venture’s TS choices (Adler
1989; Zahra 1996). Importantly, interpretive maps of the competition are developed
and shared in industries. These maps reflect perceived “industry recipes” that represent
“shared . . . metaphors [and the] taken-for-granted assumptions [that] most describe a
cohesive industry’s character” (Huff 1982: 125). These shared frameworks guide the
formation of individual ventures’ strategies (Porac, Thomas, and Baden-Fuller 1989;
Reger and Huff 1993).
Researchers continue to disagree on the best way to conceptualize the environment
(e.g., Boyd et al. 1993). Fortunately, the literature suggests three points that guided the
design of the study. First, because environmental conditions vary significantly from one
industry to another (Dess and Beard 1984), controls for these variations are necessary.
This study accomplishes this by focusing on a single industry. Second, the nature of the
environmental characteristics is inextricably linked to the stage of the industry’s evolution (Porter, 1980; Smith, Grimm, and Gannon 1993). To minimize the confounding
effects of these variations, therefore, the study examines the software industry at one
point in time. Currently, this industry is at the growth stage, as software growth in shipments far exceeds the rate of growth in the national economy (U.S. Industrial Outlook

TABLE 1 Key Dimensions of Technology Strategy (TS) and their Implications for New
Venture Performance
The literature highlights five dimensions, which are examined in this research: radicality, intensive new
product upgrades, R&D spending, the use of external sources, and the use of copyrights and other means
of intellectual capital protection. This table defines each of these dimensions and highlights its importance
for NVP.
(1) Radicality. This dimension means that the firm will develop radically new product (or process) technologies and introduce them to the market ahead of the competition (Ali 1994). Radicality is evidenced
usually in the newness of the technology itself (as in the case of breakthroughs or paradigm shifts), or
in the newness of applications the technology offers to the customer. Radicality is important for
competitive and market success during the growth stage of the firm’s industry life cycle (ILC). Indeed,
using the PIMS database, Buzzell and Gale (1987: 203) reported that 49% of the industries in their
sample experienced “major changes in technology” during the growth stage of the ILC. However,
offering radically new technologies (products) can be risky because customers may not accept these
technologies. Firm must also invest heavily in educating customers. Also, there are no guarantees that
the technology embodied in the product (or process) will become the industry’s standard (Zahra et al.
1995). However, other companies can leapfrog their pioneering technology. Despite these limitations,
developing and introducing radically new products can spell the difference between the success and
failure of the new venture. Radicality can give the venture a basis to target lucrative market segments,
build a favorable market image and strong brand recognition, develop and control access to distribution
channels, and determine the key success factors in an industry.
(2) Intensive Product Upgrades. This dimension of TS refers to the large number of revisions or extensions
of the venture’s existing products. A company that scores high on this dimension is prolific in introducing
frequent upgrades of its products, far surpassing its rivals in this regard. (Bell and McNamara 1991;
Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; McGrath 1994). These upgrades are key gaining market share, maintaining
customer loyalty (U.S. Industrial Outlook 1994), gaining access to distribution channels, and ensuring
profitability (Buzzell and Gale 1987). Upgrades are important also for creating revenues to build a
venture’s competitive position. These upgrades also serve as a credible market signal to rivals by
communicating the venture’s commitment to its industry. Finally, a full product line reinforces the
firm’s reputation among its customers, perpetuates its leadership position, and enriches its performance.
(3) R&D Spending Levels. This variable refers to the intensity of the venture’s investment in internal
R&D activities (Adler 1989; Dowling and McGee 1994; Lefebvre et al. 1992; McCann 1991) by building
the facilities, expertise, and skills needed for continuous innovation. As stated in the text, internal
R&D ensures ownership and control of key knowledge and enables the venture to profitably exploit
its innovations. It also build proprietary research platforms which lead to future success (Helfat 1994).
(4) External Sources. This TS dimension refers to the venture’s use of strategic alliances, acquisitions,
licensing agreements, and outright purchase of technology from outside sources (Adler 1989; Dowling
and McGee 1994; Kotabe and Swan 1995; Shan 1990). These sources can give the venture access to a
large pool of technological capabilities that are necessary to develop new products, offset weaknesses
in the venture’s R&D, expedite product development, and offer opportunities for learning (Dodgson
1993). Alliances and licensing also allow the firm to bundle its particular technological advantage with
key product attributes (features) developed by other firms, and quickly bring a large number of new
products to the market.
(5) Copyrights and Other Means of Intellectual Capital Protection. Ventures can use several approaches
to protect their intellectual capital, including copyrights and trade secrets (Levin et al. 1987; Nelson
1995; Teece 1986; Zahra et al. 1995). These approaches can sometimes delay the diffusion of information
and give the venture a temporary monopoly over its discoveries. Copyrights are also among the venture’s
most valued assets because they enhance its reputation and strengthen its bargaining power with venture
capitalists as well as generate the funds needed for R&D and new product commercialization (Bell
and McNamara 1991).
Several problems arise when software new ventures attempt to use copyrights. First, applications for
copyrights can leak information about the firm’s discoveries (Grant 1995), which can lower the firm’s
competitive advantage. Information leakage can enable rivals to quickly respond to the venture’s
discoveries, a factor that reduces the innovative venture’s lead time (Zahra et al. 1995) by enabling
rivals to innovate around the copyright. Second, there is a debate on the types of software activities
that can enjoy the protection of US copyright and patent laws (Zahra et al. 1995). Third, even when
the venture obtains a copyright, the enforcement of the copyright laws is questionable (Liebeskind
1996). Companies and individuals sometimes copy licensed software products and use them for purposes
other than those articulated in the licensing agreement (The Economist 1996).

TABLE 2 Dimensions of the External Environment and Their Link to Technology
Strategy (TS)
Dynamism. Dynamism reflects both the rate and unpredictability of change in the industry (Dess
and Beard 1984). These changes result from the entry or exit of competitors, changes in customers’
needs, and shifts in technological conditions (Boyd et al. 1993). These changes create opportunities
and threats for new ventures and compel their managers to act by building and leveraging
technological resources. The unpredictability of these changes can also influence managers’ investment in introducing new products and timing of their release (Porter 1983). As Dess and Beard
(1984: 56) conclude “Dynamism should be restricted to change that is hard to predict and that
heightens uncertainty for key organizational members.”
Hostility. Hostility indicates an unfavorable business climate, such as the intense competition for
resources or market opportunities (Edelstein 1992; Iansiti 1995). Hostility arises from the existence
of too many competitors, unfavorable supply conditions, and strict regulation. Hostile environments are therefore resource-poor, lean environments (Aldrich 1979); they lack the abundance
of resources and capacity needed to support a large number of companies (Dess and Beard 1984).
Competition in these environments can be based on price or non-price factors (Grant 1995).
Heterogeneity. Heterogeneity reflects the diversity of the market segments within an industry. This
diversity results from the industry’s natural conditions and from the choices the companies
themselves make. As industries evolve, new segments emerge. Competing in these segments
usually requires knowledge and expertise by the company, as it has to address a large number
of environmentally interconnected sectors, a factor which can increase the managers’ perceptions
of the complexity of their environments. Heterogeneity increases also because of companies’
strategic choices, especially the breadth of their served markets and product offerings. Frequently,
this intensifies managers’ perceptions of environmental complexity. Thus, the extent to which
the firm views its external environment as being heterogeneous depends on the industry’s variables
themselves and thee company’s strategic choices.

1994). Consequently, the study’s hypotheses will focus on the growth stage of the software industry.
Third, three characteristics of the firm’s external environment are acknowledged
in the literature and emphasized in this study: dynamism, hostility, and heterogeneity.
Although these characteristics reflect this industry’s objective conditions or result from
managerial enactment, the study emphasizes managers’ perceptions of these characteristics because these perceptions activate TS choices (Zahra 1996) and other strategic
actions (Boyd et al. 1993) Software new ventures are expected to vary significantly in
their perceptions of their environments because of the wide range of software markets
in which they compete as well as their different information processing capabilities, experiences, and resource endowments. Table 2 defines environmental munificence, complexity, and dynamism. The hypotheses suggested by the literature about the moderating impact of these variables on the associations between the different TS dimensions
and NVP are discussed next.

Dynamism and the TS-NVP Relationship
The importance of environmental dynamism stems from the fact that both the rapid rate
of technological change and the rising speed of diffusion of new ideas and technologies
(Bettis and Hitt 1995) pose serious challenges to new ventures. However, ventures frequently lack the established product lines or the resources necessary to keep up with
the speed of technological evolution. This is especially true in high technology industries
such as software where new ventures need to build and leverage their technological

<-----Page 6----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

141

capabilities in order to achieve high NVP. Moreover, as Smith et al. (1993) observe,
the uncertainty arising from dynamism is usually confounded by incomplete information about rivals’ abilities and resources. Hence, “firms will often be forced to act and
respond blindly, motivated by a fear of losing ground” (Smith et al. 1993: 126). These
responses often entail considerable imitation. However, given the absence of dominant
technological standards, the stakes are high for those ventures that hope to survive.
New ventures must differentiate themselves from rivals, hoping to create an industry
standard. Accordingly, as concluded by Porac and Thomas (1990), the competitive challenge facing software ventures is twofold: to differentiate themselves from the competition (to develop an industry standard) and to imitate (to avoid missteps with the market). This section outlines the TS choices expected to enhance NVP in a dynamic
environment.

Radicality
Dynamic industries, such as software, usually encourage the development of radically
new products and technologies (Ali 1994) in order to capture premium market segments, or preempt competitors’ entry (Utterback 1994). Developing and introducing
radically new products is a proactive, aggressive attempt to push out the edge of the
technological frontier in an industry on a regular basis (Kerin et al. 1992). By developing
and introducing radically new products, a new venture can influence its industry’s evolution by shaping product design and configuration (Porter 1985), and establishing the
rules of competition.
In a dynamic environment, a new venture should repeatedly develop and introduce
radically new products, as any gains will quickly be diffused to rivals and its advantages
lost. Indeed, those ventures that act as technological followers may have difficulty sustaining a high level of performance over time. Technological followers can sometimes
gain the necessary knowledge to offer a viable substitute quickly, which reduces the
costs of developing radically new products (Kerin et al. 1992). However, by the time
the follower has reached the market the rapid pace of technological change will have
pushed the frontier further out. Consequently, the speed with which the product is copied is usually offset by the speed with which that technology advances. Similarly, the
occasional development and introduction of radically new products may produce only
short periods of economic rents prior to diffusion, followed by a return to mediocre
levels of performance. A TS based on second moving or the occasional introduction
of radically new products therefore is better suited for a more stable environment
(Miller and Friesen 1984). In a dynamic environment, however, developing and introducing radically new products on a regular basis is expected to improve NVP by enabling
the venture to repeatedly target premium segments, build high market shares (Buzzell
and Gale 1987), and achieve market leadership (Golder 1993; Tellis 1993). Despite the
risks inherent in this strategy, the development and introduction of radically new products can improve profitability and GMS in a dynamic environment. Therefore:
H1a1: In a dynamic environment, developing and introducing radically new products will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H1a2: In a dynamic environment, developing and introducing radically new products will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

<-----Page 7----->142

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

Intensive Product Upgrades
In a dynamic environment, the venture that introduces more products to the market
can achieve superior NVP, despite the high costs associated with these activities. Some
of these products may be radically new offerings as described above in H1a, or extensions or upgrades of existing products, the focus of this section. A large number of product upgrades can also increase the likelihood of having a successful product at any given
time period. Over time, this stream of successful hits through successive upgrades assures steady profits, which generates the cash flow needed to support the venture’s R&
D efforts. Ventures with relatively few product hits can not sustain high NVP because,
in a dynamic environment, few products last long as big money makers because of the
rapid diffusion and imitation. As a result, the financial gains from any single new product
introduction in a dynamic environment may be short-lived.
A lack of constant hits can also undermine the venture’s bargaining power with
down-stream channels that sometimes help maintain marginal products. These constraints are particularly critical for young firms which often lack established relationships or other assets that could be leveraged in lieu of a strong product line. Also, if
several firms compete by offering a large number of new products through upgrades,
the quantity of their competitive offerings may make it impossible for all firms to realize
economic rents from this strategy. Thus, in a dynamic environment, frequent product
upgrades and extensions are necessary to capitalize on the changes in a firm’s industry
and achieve profitability and GMS (Hambrick 1983; Iansiti 1995). Therefore:
H1b1: In a dynamic environment, intensive product upgrades will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H1b2: In a dynamic environment, intensive product upgrades will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

R&D Spending Levels
Dynamism also creates many opportunities for growth and profitability (Utterback
1994). Consequently, new ventures in dynamic industries need to develop and introduce
many products to build market share and gain access to vital distribution channels. However, exploiting these opportunities requires strong and patient R&D investments (Porter 1985) as well as continuous innovation.
Strong R&D investments in maintaining state-of-the-art facilities and excellent researchers are especially important for building the venture’s technological competencies, the keys to sustained profitability and GMS (Bogner and Thomas 1996). Internal
R&D also ensures the venture’s ownership and control of key knowledge, and gives
the venture the ability to profitably exploit its technological developments and build
proprietary research platforms that lead to future success. Internal R&D is important
also because technological knowledge usually develops in a path-dependent way (Dosi
1988), and the knowledge gained at any one point in time becomes a foundation for
later R&D efforts. If R&D investments in such platforms are nurtured and properly
safeguarded over time, then NVP can increase.
The high speed with which technology shifts and the rapid pace of knowledge diffusion in a dynamic environment usually combine to require high investments in internal
R&D activities (Dodgson 1991, 1993). Similarly, firms in dynamic industries also recog-

<-----Page 8----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

143

nize the possibility of rapid diffusion (Mansfield, Schwartz, and Wagner 1981), which
can weaken the competitive position of those ventures that may not have built strong
technological platforms. Unless new ventures invest heavily in internal R&D, their viability becomes questionable (Bell and McNamara 1991). Conversely, those ventures
that invest heavily in R&D can establish a strong competitive position, gain market
share, and achieve profitability.1 Therefore:
H1c1: In a dynamic environment, R&D spending will be positively associated with
a new venture’s profits.
H1c2: In a dynamic environment, R&D spending will be positively associated with
a new venture’s GMS.

External Sources of Technology
Increasingly, new ventures that compete in dynamic environments are pressured to explore external sources of technologies (Shan 1990; Teece 1986). As noted in Table 1,
new ventures can combine technologies secured from external sources with internal resources to offer radically new products or upgrade existing ones. This bundling of external and internal technologies can enhance the venture’s capacity to introduce highly
differentiated products quickly and economically (McGrath 1994). Further, given that
rapid technological change increases results in rapid obsolescence, new ventures should
make use of external sources. Besides, in this environment, the variety of internal resource bases found among new firms reduces the odds of a single firm being able to
capture all or even many of the key thrusts that are occurring in a given market at any
one time.
Although the use of external sources can sometimes reduce the profits earned on
a given product (due to royalties or profit sharing with partners), this strategy can increase the regularity of generating product hits and ensure the stability of cash flow.
This strategy also allows those new firms possessing a key piece of technology to plug
into and pull out of alliances and other arrangements in response to changes in their
market or the performance of their partners. This can give a new venture flexibility in
meeting the demands of its external environment. Clearly, it is advantageous for new
ventures to gain and seek access to a larger, more diverse pool of technological capabilities through external linkages and partnerships (Tyler and Steensma 1995).
The above observations support Link and Tassey’s (1987) argument that environmental dynamism is conducive to the acquisition and licensing of externally-generated
technologies. They also support Auster’s (1992) finding that technological linkages are
highest in emerging, dynamic industries. Likewise, they reinforce Hagedoorn’s (1993)
conclusion that alliances aimed at technological complementarity and shortening the
1
The relationship between R&D spending and new venture profitability is complex. In a dynamic
environment, low R&D spending does not support the firm’s effort to create a sustainable competitive advantage. But as the new venture increases its R&D spending, its profits are likely to rise until a point of diminishing
returns is reached and profits decline. Higher R&D investments do not always generate new products that
can be quickly commercialized. Also, in a dynamic environment the odds are small that the firm will generate
many products that will become huge money makers. Thus, a non-linear relationship might exist between
R&D and profits. Therefore, to determine whether this non-linear relationship exists in the current data,
the squared term for R&D spending was entered into the second step of the regression analysis for both
ROE and market share growth. The results did not support this non-linear relationship. Still, because the
results may be industry specific, future researchers should determine whether the relationship between R&
D investment and venture performance is non-linear.

product development cycle are more prevalent in the dynamic than in stable environments. Hagedoorn notes that partnerships are especially important in the software industry as a means for gaining access to the multiple technologies necessary for the development of advanced applications. Besides broadening a venture’s product offerings,
external technology sources can offset weaknesses in the venture’s internal R&D and
give it major opportunities for learning about the competition (Dodgson 1993).
Therefore:
H1d1: In a dynamic environment, the use of external technology sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H1d2: In a dynamic environment, the use of external technology sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

Patents, Copyrights, and Other Means of Protection of Intellectual Capital
Dynamism is expected to encourage a new venture to copyright or patent its innovations
and safeguard them against abuses by rivals. Patents and copyrights can give the venture
some control over the fate of its discoveries which it can exploit through licensing agreements or other means. They also enhance the venture’s reputation, strengthen its bargaining power with venture capitalists, and obtain the funds necessary to support internal R&D (Bell and McNamara 1991). Patents and copyrights are useful also in joining
strategic alliances, while protecting the venture’s intellectual property, which increases
the new venture’s ability to gain market share and achieve growth.
However, some researchers argue that the legal protection of the venture’s intellectual assets is time consuming and expensive and is of little value in fast changing industries such as software. The time and expense of obtaining such protection, the speed
of technological diffusion (Liebskind 1996; Saxenian 1990), and the difficulty and expense of detecting infringement all cast doubts on the wisdom of this strategy (Mansfield
et al. 1981; Rogers and Rogers 1984). Besides, both patents and copyrights are usually
narrowly defined and have a limited life (Liebskind 1996). The present study, therefore,
provides an opportunity to test the opposing views on the value of copyrights in a critical,
dynamic industry. To ensure completeness, however, the hypothesis will be stated here
(and in subsequent sections addressing other environmental moderators) following the
conventional wisdom. Therefore:
H1e1: In a dynamic environment, the use of patents, copyrights and other means
of protecting intellectual capital will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H1e2: In a dynamic environment, the use of patents, copyrights, and other means of
protecting intellectual capital will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

Hostility and the TS-NVP Relationship
A second consideration in selecting the venture’s TS is hostility (Iansiti 1995), which
often pressures managers to pursue conservative choices. As noted in Table 2, hostile
environments are characterized by limited resources and intense competition. They are
lean, non-munificent environments (Dess and Beard 1984), where new ventures must
work hard to achieve survival.

<-----Page 10----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

145

Hostility can manifest itself in two distinct ways: price and non-price competition.
According to Grant (1995), during the early stages of the industry cycle, companies compete based on technological innovation (e.g., product radicality). However, as the industry becomes more established, competition usually shifts to price-related (Porter 1980)
concerns where “[t]echnological competition may still be important, but the emphasis
is on the use of technology to obtain low costs and quality advantage” (Grant 1995:
240). The nature of hostility, like other perceived environmental characteristics, varies
by the stage of the firm’s industry life cycle.
The distinction between price and non-price hostility is critical, as the venture’s
competitive responses and product features may vary considerably by the type of hostility that dominates the market (Porter 1980). When price-related hostility is high, customers typically demand product functionality and efficiency. Consequently, a venture’s
strategic responses will typically center on reducing costs or charging low prices, because
successful NVP requires effective cost containment strategies (Grant 1995). By contrast,
offering valued product features (e.g., image) will be more important than cost management when non-price hostility prevails. In this environment, an effective TS will typically
center on building the skills that imbue those distinctive qualities that customers demand.
Consequently, hostility will moderate the TS-NVP relationship, as discussed next.

Radicality
As environmental hostility rises, the development and introduction of radically new
products will decline as new ventures will compete primarily as technological followers
(Ali 1994; Kerin et al. 1992). One reason is that hostility usually reduces the resources
available for the venture’s radical product development activities (Miller and Friesen
1984). Also, since radically new products usually represent a major departure from existing and known product attributes, the high risks and high costs associated with their
development might not be an acceptable risk to venture managers as the failure of these
products can cause the demise of the young firm. Consequently, under these conditions,
venture managers might conclude that developing radically new products is a high-risk
strategy whose costs outweigh potential benefits.
The need to refrain from developing and introducing radically new products will
grow as hostility rises. When price hostility is high, the combination of tight margins
and limited cash flows will frequently discourage these efforts, as found by Ettlie and
Bridges (1982) who reported a negative association between price volatility and radical
product innovations. This decline may result from competitive price pressures that push
excess profits in the industry to bid down to commodity levels. Likewise, in a market
where strong non-price competition prevails, the demand for upgrades, enhanced service, and other value additions will increase a new venture’s expenses. Even if higher
prices can be obtained, the high costs incurred to ensure product differentiation through
radical innovation will reduce the venture’s profits. Therefore:
H2a1: In an environment with high price hostility, developing and introducing radically new products will be negatively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H2a2: In an environment with high non-price hostility, developing and introducing
radically new products will be negatively associated with a new venture’s profits.

Besides reducing the profits to be gained from radically new products, hostility may

<-----Page 11----->146

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

inhibit GMS. Price hostility lowers the venture’s profit margins and reduces the cash
available to develop and market radically new products. In the absence of radically new
products, however, attempts to move competition away from a price-based rivalry and
grow beyond the firm’s current size will be stifled. High price-based hostility often signals that customers are not searching for significant qualitative differences among competing products. With their needs being satisfied by existing products, customers usually
stress prices in making their purchasing decisions. In markets where non-price hostility
prevails, however, the situation is reversed. Although the bulk of radical product innovation will be devoted to defending existing market positions, radicality can become a
foundation for the firm’s GMS as innovative products will be rewarded by those customers
seeking non-price distinctiveness among competing product offerings. Therefore:
H2a3: In an environment with high price hostility, developing and introducing radically new products will be negatively associated with a new venture’s GMS.
H2a4: In an environment with high non-price hostility, developing and introducing
radically new products will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

Intensive Product Upgrades
To succeed in a hostile environment, a new venture should also upgrade its products
by quickly modifying or extending its existing offerings (Iansiti 1995). Upgrades can
enable the venture to maintain customer loyalty without incurring substantial costs in
designing, testing, and developing radically new products. However, as noted earlier,
even with frequent product upgrades, a new venture might not achieve significant gains
in profits because product upgrades are costly. In this environment, the venture must
work hard to simply remain afloat and will just as likely invest heavily in building its
distribution channels, advertising or expanding its marketing activities (Porter 1980).
For a young firm, however, this spending usually amounts to a higher percentage of
sales than for its established rivals. In a market with high price hostility, these pressures
create a “squeeze”, as lower prices and increased expenses greatly reduce a venture’s
profit margins. These added expenses can lower a firm’s net gains from upgrades (Brown
and Eisenhardt 1995). However, such demand for product upgrades is often helpful to
firms in a non-price-hostile environment, where upgrades allow firms to charge premium
prices, retain customer loyalty, and capture additional market shares. Therefore:
H2b1: In an environment with high price hostility, intensive product upgrades will
be negatively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H2b2: In an environment with high non-price hostility, intensive product upgrades
will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.

Growth in the venture’s sales and market share will also benefit from offering frequent product upgrades, in both price and non-price hostile environments. When competition is price-based, introducing product upgrades that are fine tuned to variations
in market preferences can add costs that reduce the venture’s profits. However, these
expenditures may be the only way by which the venture can achieve sales growth. In
this environment, any price cuts to increase GMS will be quickly matched by rivals and,
as argued above, radically new products are neither rewarded by the customers nor economically feasible. Similarly, the frequent introduction of product upgrades can increase the venture’s share where non-price hostility is intense. Such upgrades will be

<-----Page 12----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

147

highly demanded and customers will reward those ventures that are quick to respond
to market changes with GMS. Thus:
H2b3: In an environment with high price hostility, intensive product upgrades will
be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.
H2b4: In an environment with high non-price hostility, intensive product upgrades
will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

R&D Spending Level
Given the limited opportunities available in a hostile environment, managers are expected to lower their R&D investments. Believing that heavy R&D spending puts the
venture at financial risk. This will be particularly true when hostility is price-based, profit
margins are low, and the market does not reward radically new products. If the venture
maintains an aggressive R&D program, then it risks diluting its resources without
achieving satisfactory returns on its investments. Buzzell and Gale (1987) and Scherer
and Huh (1992) have previously found this to be true among established companies
competing in hostile environments. Consistent with these findings, new ventures in a
hostile environment are expected to reduce their R&D spending in order to obtain
higher profits. Similarly, in markets where non-price hostility prevails, incremental innovation is expected to replace developing radically new products as a primary means
for gaining and maintaining customer loyalty (Utterback 1994; Prusa and Schmitz 1994).
Thus, the overall relationship between the venture’s R&D spending and profit should
be positive in markets where non-price competition exists because customers usually
reward innovation. Therefore:
H2c1: In an environment with high price hostility, intensive R&D spending will be
negatively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H2c2: In an environment with high non-price hostility, intensive R&D spending will
be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.

The relationship between R&D spending and a firm’s GMS is also expected to vary
by the type of the hostility a firm may experience. Price hostility scantly rewards
R&D. As mentioned above, product upgrades are conducive to higher GMS in a pricesensitive market. Also, in this environment, all R&D expenditures come from pressured
margins and may take funds away from the marketing and distribution efforts that can
increase the venture’s sales volume, the key to profitability in a low-margin business
(Porter 1980). Thus, on balance, R&D spending will be negatively associated with
growth in a market with high price hostility. The opposite is expected to be true with
high non-price hostility, where R&D can promote incremental and radical product innovations as a means of ensuring customer satisfaction. Thus, under high non-price hostility, high R&D spending can promote GMS. Therefore:
H2c3: In an environment with high price hostility, intensive R&D spending will be
negatively associated with a new venture’s GMS.
H2c4: In an environment with high non-price hostility, intensive R&D spending will
be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

<-----Page 13----->148

External Technology Sources
Although hostility usually pressures new ventures to lower their R&D spending, it may
also encourage them to offset this with increases in their use of external sources of technology (Kotabe and Swan 1995). External sources can give the ventures quick access
to multiple technologies (Dodgson 1993), shorten new product development cycles, and
reduce the high risks associated with new product development efforts. External sources
can also help new ventures safeguard against competence destroying changes in their
industry (Tushman and Anderson 1986) by licensing technologies from other firms, instead of relying solely on internal R&D (Link and Tassey 1987). They can also reduce
the uncertainty associated with technology development and quicken the ventures’ responses to changing market conditions. When price hostility is high, customers become
experienced and their expectations from all firms rise (Porter 1980). When the costs
and risks of product development are shared with alliance partners, new ventures’
profitability improves. Similarly, in markets where non-price competition is fierce, new
ventures’ can bundle their product traits with those of their partners, which can also
increase profits. Therefore:
H2d1: In an environment with high price hostility, the use of external technology
sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H2d2: In an environment with high non-price hostility, the use of external technology sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s profits.

Technology partnerships can also positively influence a venture’s GMS. Under
conditions of high price competition, new ventures that find ways to share the costs of
technology will have more free cash for building and supporting their distribution and
marketing activities. Thus, the ventures’ resources can be dedicated to broadening the
sales base, building sales volume, cutting unit costs, and achieving further growth. Indeed, this is the “textbook” case of Porter’s low-cost leadership advantage (1980). Under non-price hostility, new ventures that can lever-up their product attributes with
those of their technology alliance partners will out-grow those firms that lack such partnerships. Alliances also enable new ventures to bring to their markets new products
that few, if any, firms could develop and introduce on their own. Under high non-price
hostility, customers usually reward such combinations and the ventures’ market shares
grow accordingly. Therefore:
H2d3: In an environment with high price hostility, the use of external technology
sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.
H2d4: In an environment with high non-price hostility, the use of external technology sources will be positively associated with a new venture’s growth.

Patents, Copyrights, and the Protection of Intellectual Capital
In a hostile environment, rivals usually have an incentive to copy the new venture’s
products or reverse engineer them. Imitation of competitors’ products can reduce the
costs and risks associated with internal new product development. However, by using
copyrights, patents, or similar approaches, the venture can reduce its rivals’ ability to
copy its products and control the conditions under which a competitor gains access to
its technologies. In the software industry, having copyrights or patents can also give a

<-----Page 14----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

149

venture a temporary monopoly (Levin, Klevorick, Nelson, and Winter 1987) and enhance the venture’s ability to introduce and profitably exploit its new technology. A
new venture that holds a copyright can also license its technology to other firms and
generate revenues, or enter strategic alliances and gain access to other firms’ innovative
technologies. However, as noted earlier, the high costs of both registration and enforcement of copyrights and other means of legally protecting their intellectual capital have
led some to question the wisdom of this strategy (Liebeskind 1996). Also, the knowledge
covered in these patents and copyrights are difficult to protect because it is difficult to
detect its illegal use (Liebeskind 1996). In this environment, imitation of rivals’ products
is common (Porter 1980). Thus, the conventional wisdom should be tested in this study
to establish if these efforts increase a venture’s ability to build market share and offer
distinctive products that improve performance.
When high price hostility exists, distinctive product features are not part of the
competitive bundle and customers usually focus primarily on price in making their buying decisions. In this setting, copyright and patents can leak important information to the
competition about the venture’s innovations and, consequently, reduce the venture’s
overall profits. However, when non-price hostility is high, the situation becomes murkier, as those features and traits that enhance product differentiation become the key
source of a venture’s competitive advantage and profits. If patents and copyrights are
effective, their use should increase a venture’s profits. Therefore:
H2e1: Under high price hostility, the use of patents, copyrights, and other approaches to protect the new venture’s intellectual capital will be negatively associated
with the venture’s profits.
H2e2: Under high non-price hostility, the use of patents, copyrights, and other approaches to protect the new venture’s intellectual capital will be positively associated
with the venture’s profits.

Patents and copyrights can also determine the growth of new ventures, depending
on the type of hostility that dominates the market. When price hostility is high, the use
of patents and copyrights only adds costs and takes the scarce cash resources that the
venture’s thin profit margins do provide away from investments in those capabilities
that usually drive growth in such a market such as distribution systems. Conversely,
conventional wisdom suggests that the way in which the cash flow that fuels GMS in
hostile environment is through the aggressive protection of the venture’s innovations
(Liebeskind 1996). Therefore:
H2e3: Under high price hostility, the use of patents, copyrights, and other approaches to protect the new venture’s intellectual capital will be negatively associated
with high GMS.
H2e4: Under high non-price hostility, the use of patents, copyrights, and other approaches to protect the new venture’s intellectual capital will be positively associated
with high GMS.

Heterogeneity and the TS-NVP Relationship
As noted in Table 2, heterogeneity indicates the perceived complexity of the venture’s
external environment (Boyd et al. 1993), based on the multiplicity of the factors that

<-----Page 15----->150

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

a venture must address. This section discusses heterogeneity’s potential moderating impact on the TS-NVP relationship.

Radicality
A key source of perceived heterogeneity is the emergence of multiple segments in an
industry because of changes in customer needs and expectations (Slater and Narver
1994), particularly during the introductory and growth stages of an industry’s life cycle
(Grant 1995; Porter 1980). The emergence of these segments may encourage new ventures to redefine their markets by pursuing aggressive radical product introductions.
These innovations are likely to be profitable because the firm can target new customer
groups and position its products as the “industry standard,” which can also stimulate
GMS. Therefore:
H3a1: In a heterogeneous environment, developing and introducing radically new
products will be positively associated with a new venture’s profit.
H3a2: In a heterogeneous environment, developing and introducing radically new
products will be positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

Intensive Product Upgrades
In a heterogeneous environment, frequent incremental product upgrades can also help
the venture capture new market segments and respond quickly to changes in the needs
of its customers. A venture can offer frequent upgrades of its existing products or target
new segments by using existing or revised products (Grant 1995), which can increase
the venture’s market shares. Product upgrades and extensions also permit the ventures
to target new segments and achieve high profits and growth. Prior research, using data
from established companies, has reached a similar conclusion (Miller 1987). Therefore:
H3b1: In a heterogeneous environment, intensive product upgrades will be positively associated with the venture’s profits.
H3b2: In a heterogeneous environment, intensive product upgrades will be positively associated with the new venture’s GMS.

R&D Spending Levels
A new venture that competes in an heterogeneous environment is expected to continue
its innovation intensively and capitalize on emerging opportunities in an industry while
maintaining the loyalty of its existing customers (Zahra et al. 1995). Continuous innovation also requires a new venture to invest heavily in internal R&D activities, and develop
those products that can capture large enough segments that will support the venture’s
GMS objectives. Consequently, in this environment, strong investments in R&D can
improve NVP by attracting new customers and retaining the loyalty of existing segments. For those ventures that compete through radical product innovation, strong
R&D investments can improve profitability and GMS. Therefore:
H3c1: In a heterogeneous environment, R&D spending will be positively associated
with a new venture’s profits.

<-----Page 16----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

151

H3c2: In a heterogeneous environment, R&D spending will be positively associated
with a new venture’s GMS.

External Technology Sources
In a heterogeneous environment, a new venture needs to obtain new and diverse technological capabilities, which can be quickly and efficiently achieved by entering strategic
alliances and using other external technology sources (Hagedoorn 1993). These sources
gain importance as the environment becomes more heterogeneous, because no single
firm can possess all required technologies to meet customers’ needs. Given that heterogeneity makes learning a time consuming process (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995), the use
of external technology sources can also improve the venture’s technological capabilities
and quicken its responsiveness to the market. New ventures that make good use of external technology sources by creating new products or upgrading existing ones can acquire
additional market shares and achieve higher profits. Therefore:
H3d1: In a heterogeneous environment, emphasis on the use of external sources of
technology is positively associated with a new venture’s profits.
H3d2: In a heterogeneous environment, emphasis on the use of external sources of
technology is positively associated with a new venture’s GMS.

Patents, Copyrights, and the Protection of Intellectual Capital
In a heterogeneous environment, any product—whether protected by copyright (or patented) or not—can command only a small portion of the market, which can limit the
venture’s financial benefits. A strong copyright or a patent can at best sustain a niche
position, and the returns to the venture’s copyright will be limited because of the narrow
scope of the copyright. Even if the protected product is superior to its close substitutes,
the percentage of the overall market made up of all substitutes will be small. Also, how
rivals respond to the venture’s copyrights (patents) will affect the gains a venture can
achieve. In this environment, where the differences in product from one segment to
another are relatively small, rivals have an incentive to imitate each others’ products,
which can lower the value of the copyright for the innovative firm. Yet, heterogeneity
encourages competitors to direct their resources to one of the other segments in the
market, instead of challenging the copyright holder’s superior products. Thus, a small
market might exist for each copyright holder, but there also is a reduced incentive for
rivals to challenge that position. Although the outcomes of each competitive contest
will be determined on a case-by-case basis, conventional wisdom would suggest that
those ventures that hold copyrights (or patents) are likely to capture additional market
shares and achieve higher GMS and profitability. Therefore:
H3e1: In a heterogeneous environment, the use of patents, copyrights, and other
means of protecting intellectual property will be positively associated with a new
venture’s profits.
H3e2: In a heterogeneous environment, the use of patents, copyrights, and other
means of protecting intellectual property will be positively associated with a new
venture’s GMS.

METHOD
The U.S. software industry offered an interesting setting in which to test the study’s
hypotheses, it has been one of the most prolific in new product development and introduction (Prusa and Schmitz 1994). The phenomenal growth of the industry has also encouraged the creation of companies that depend heavily on commercializing new products, which has spurred further innovation and encouraged market aggressiveness
among companies. This union of technology and marketing has made the software industry one of the most dynamic and fiercely competitive arenas. Ventures have responded to these challenges by developing new markets and attracting new customers,
which has further increased the perceived heterogeneity of the industry. The wide range
of software markets offers a variety of competitive contexts, all within the confines of
a single industry.
The software industry was also chosen for study because it is one of the key industries of the future. Companies and countries that dominate this industry can leverage
their technological skills in other vital industries (U.S. Industrial Outlook 1994). Consequently, retaining a worldwide lead is crucial for strengthening the global position of
the U.S. and its companies. Recently, Japan and Western European countries have increased their investments in the industry, aiming to dethrone U.S. companies. Understanding the technological strategies of U.S. companies, therefore, can be helpful in discovering the sources of their competitive advantage. Finally, despite the limitations of
single-industry studies, focusing on one industry has the advantage of providing respondents with a common frame of reference and reducing the potentially confounding effects of diverse macro-environmental conditions (Dess, Ireland, and Hitt 1990).

Sample
To collect data, the software industry’s two major trade associations were contacted to
identify the names and addresses of new ventures. The Software Publishers’ Association
provided a list of 413 names, primarily of microcomputer software producers. The Computer Software and Services Industry Association’s list contained 600 names. Major
newspapers were also reviewed for articles published on new software ventures, which
yielded 18 additional names. Together, these sources generated 1,031 software venture names.
Three criteria were then used to select the sample. First, only companies that were
eight years or younger were included, which reduced the sample to 773. Second, the
study targeted only those ventures that actually developed and marketed software products; ventures that provided only customer services (e.g., educational or training programs) were excluded in order to focus on new ventures that competed by creating software products. This further reduced the sample to 629 ventures. Finally, to control for
macro environmental forces, the study examined only U.S.-based software ventures,
which reduced the target sample to 581.
A mail survey was then used to collect data from the 581 ventures. Personalized
letters accompanied each survey, encouraging participation in the research and assuring
respondents of the confidentiality of their replies. Twenty-seven questionnaires were
returned undelivered. Three mailings, over a period of two months, produced 127 completed replies, of which 116 were usable, for a response rate of 20.9%. This response
rate compared favorably with the 11.1% achieved by other researchers from the same

<-----Page 18----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

153

general population (e.g., Gartner and Thomas 1993), and was above the 16% achieved
by Price Waterhouse in its Software Industry Business Practices Survey, commissioned
by the Massachusetts Computer Software Council, Inc. (1991).
Tests also determined the representation of the sample to the population from
which it was drawn. Initially, the combined responses from the first and second mail
waves were compared to the known attributes of non-responding companies. Given that
the study’s population included many privately owned small companies, data were not
available for all observations for all non-respondents. T-tests indicated that responding
and non-responding firms did not differ significantly in their age (p , 0.41), employees
(p , 0.23) or return on equity (p , 0.37). Additionally, to examine response bias by
location within the U.S., a 2 test was conducted but was not significant (p , 0.41), indicating the absence of such bias. The t-test also revealed that respondents to the first and
second mailings were not significantly different in their age (p , 0.71), employees (p
,.83), return on equity (p , 0.41), and sales growth (p , 0.26). These results indicated
that the sample resembled its target population in several key attributes.
To ensure reliable data, the questionnaire was sent to a second senior manager in
each responding venture (n 5 116). Forty-nine of these managers responded and their
replies were then matched with replies from the main survey. Simple correlations between the two sets of respondents showed significant interrater reliability on the study’s
variables, as will be presented in Table 5 later in the paper.

Measures
The data used in this paper are a part of a larger study of the software industry. For
the current paper, the data covered a new venture’s environment, TS, performance, and
statistical controls.2

1. Competitive Environment
To measure venture managers’ perceptions of their environments, the 12-item measure
developed and validated by Miller and Friesen (1982) was used to gauge these perceptions. When subjected to factor analysis, with a varimax orthogonal rotation, these items
yielded four significant factors (with eigenvalues above 1.0) that accounted for 61.2 percent of the variance. The results, which appear in Table 3, showed that the measures
captured the original factors theorized by Miller and Friesen (1982), except that hostility
emerged as having two dimensions: price and non-price. Even though the response format used in this study differed from the original format used by Miller and Friesen
(1982), which might account for the separation of the price and non-price hostility factors, two previous studies that used the revised format (Zahra 1991, 1996) produced
results that were consistent with Miller and Friesen’s conceptualization, which would
suggest that the current results are industry-specific. The two hostility types found in
this paper might have reflected the conditions in the software industry where price wars
were commonplace (U.S. Industrial Outlook 1994). Items that had absolute loadings
of 0.50 or above were emphasized in constructing four factors:

Data for all the study’s measures were collected for the three-year prior to the survey administration.

a
Items followed a 5-point response format (1 5 very untrue vs. 5 5 very true);
b
Items followed a 5-point response format (1 5 low vs. 5 5 high).

Factor 1: Heterogeneity (4 items): This factor indicated the perceived complexity of
a venture’s environment and an attempt by the venture to respond to this complexity.
Factor 2: Dynamism (3 items): This factor indicated high perceived rates of change
in the industry because of intensive R&D and advertising activities.
Factor 3: Non-Price Hostility (2 items): This factor reflected the perceived unfavorableness of a new venture’s external environment, as evidenced by a high rate of
bankruptcies and the venture’s reliance on non-price variables in building the venture’s market position.
Factor 4: Price-Related Hostility (3 items): This factor indicated the perceived intensity of rivalry in the industry, coupled with intense pressures to reduce prices.

2. Technology Strategy
Twenty items were extracted from the literature to capture TS (e.g., Cooper 1984a,
1984b; Lefebvre et al. 1992; Zahra and Covin 1993). When the 20 items were factor
analyzed (with a varimax rotation), they produced five significant factors that, combined, explained 74.7% of the variance. These results are reported in Table 4 and described below.
Factor 1: Internal R&D Investments (5 items): This factor captured the venture’s
heavy investment in internal R&D and indicated that the venture was committed
to maintaining a highly professional staff, having state-of-the-art R&D facilities, and
providing strong financial support for R&D.
Factor 2: External Sources (4 items): This factor indicated the venture’s reliance on
external sources of technology, and showed that the venture was either active in technology-based alliances or licensed technologies from other companies.

Factor 3: Intensity of Product Upgrades (4 items): This factor indicated the venture’s
strong commitment to introducing a large number of product modifications or extensions, surpassing their key competitors.
Factor 4: Radicality of New Products (3 items): This factor indicated the venture’s
commitment to introducing radically new products (technologies) and showed a
strong disposition by the venture to be among the first in its industry to introduce
new products.3
Factor 5: Copyrights, Patents and Protection of Intellectual Capital (4 items): This
factor showed a venture’s interest in, and use of, patenting and other means (e.g.,
trade secrets) to protect the fruits of its innovation.

3. NVP: Profitability and Market Share Growth
Measuring NVP has been the subject of debate in the literature (e.g., Chandler and
Hanks 1993). Yet, there is agreement that the complexity of the NVP construct requires
the use of both growth and profitability measures because of the tradeoffs that might
exist between these measures (Brush and VanderWerf 1992). Profitability was measured by the average of its three-year ROE, which indicated a venture’s success in using
its resources effectively to make a profit. Still, ROE was affected by the owners’ salaries
and other cost items that were frequently not disclosed to the public.
To overcome the limitations of ROE, two objective measures of growth were considered: sales growth and growth in market share (GMS). Sales growth showed the market acceptance of a venture’s products and, therefore, was a key indicator of market
success (Chandler and Hanks 1993; Cooper et al. 1989; Dowling and McGee 1994).
However, Tsai et al. (1991: 14) suggested that GMS “may be the best measure of new
venture performance available”. GMS, which shows a venture’s progress in building
a strong market base at a rate greater than the overall industry growth, is a predictor
of profitability. Consequently, the survey asked managers to report the percentage
growth in their firm’s market share over the past three-year period. However, this measure was difficult to interpret because software companies varied widely in their market
definitions. Given that the sales growth and GMS measures were highly correlated (r 5
0.87), only the results based on GMS were reported in this paper.
Data for performance measures were collected through the survey for two reasons.
First, many firms were privately owned and did not publish performance results. Second,
the performance of corporate venture firms were not separated from their sponsoring
corporations. Data for ROE for a subset of 41 privately-owned venture were significantly correlated with secondary survey data, (r 5 0.74, p , 0.001). We did the same
for a subset of corporate sponsored companies and the correlation was also significant
(r 5 0.69, p , 0.001). Combined with the significant interrater data reported in Table 5,
these results increased our confidence in the study’s NVP measures. However, because
validation analyses were conducted using subsets of data, caution is necessary.
3
One of the items that loaded significantly on this factor, “Is the industry’s leader in introducing new
products”, might conceptually overlap with the domain of the “intensity of product upgrade” factors. To test
this possibility, we reran the factor analysis to force the radicality and upgrade factors into a single factor
by specifying a four-factor solution. The results, however, indicated that the two factors were still distinct
and that the “industry leader” in new product loaded significantly on the radicality factor. These results led
us to believe that the respondents might have associated industry leadership in new product introductions
with being a pioneering firm that offered many new products. Of course, the results might be industry specific.

4. Statistical Control Variables
The study also controlled for the venture’s age, size, origin, and business scope. These
variables affected the venture’s ability to obtain and deploy resources (Bell & McNamara 1991) and TS choices (Bogner and Thomas 1996; Zahra 1996). A limitation of
the study, however, was failing to explore the direct effect of these variables on the
profit and NVP relationships.
Venture Size. The study controlled for the venture’s size because larger ventures
might have possessed more resources that allowed them to support R&D and introduce
more new products than smaller ventures. The natural log of employees was used as
the measure of company size.
Venture Age. The study also controlled for a venture’s age because younger ventures might have pursued more radical innovations than older ventures (Rosen 1991).
Age was measured by the number of years the venture had been in existence.4
Market (Business) Scope. Ventures that competed in a broadly defined market
were expected to spend more on R&D and introduce more new products (Buzzell and
Gale 1987) than ventures that defined their markets narrowly.5 To control for differences in market scope, executives’ reports on the number of market segments their company pursued were used as a control variable.
Venture Origin. The analysis also controlled for the venture’s origin, whether it
was created by an independent entrepreneur (coded 0) or an established company
(coded 1). Origin served as a proxy for the venture’s access to different resources. Corporate sponsored ventures typically had greater access to their parent company’s financial, marketing, and technological resources (Zahra 1996), which allowed them to pursue more aggressive TS. Independent ventures, which were often more constrained in
their resources, might pursue different TS from corporate ventures. It should be noted
that corporate ventures studied here were either divisions or subsidiaries of established
companies and, therefore, were subject to their managerial and strategic control. Consequently, performance data for corporate ventures were not readily available in secondary sources, as noted earlier.

Analysis
Table 5 presents the results for interrater agreement, measured by the simple correlations between the two sets of data received from executives in 49 companies. It also
4
To explore the implications of the venture’s age for TS, the sample was split into two groups: very
young ventures (3 years or younger) and older ventures (4 years and older). Both the t-test and discriminant
analysis were used to pinpoint the differences between these two venture groups in TS. The two tests yielded
identical results; both show that younger ventures had significantly higher scores than older ventures on two
variables: product radicality and R&D spending. Older companies (4 years and older), however, had significantly higher scores on product upgrades and use of external sources. Venture scores for the use of copyrights
and patents were not statistically different between the two groups.
5
Some past research suggests that business scope (breadth) might impact the ventures’ TS. To examine
this possibility, ventures were split at the mean into two groups: focused versus broad scope. T-tests indicated
that ventures with broad market scope had significantly higher scores than focused ventures in three variables
(p , 0.05): R&D spending, upgrades, and use of external sources. No statistically significant differences were
found between the two groups in radicality or the use of patents and copyrights.

shows the means, standard deviations, and the intercorrelations among the study’s variables. There was no evidence of multicolinearity among the independent variables. Consequently, moderated regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses (Cohen and
Cohen 1983). In Step 1, each NVP measure was regressed on the control variables. In
Step 2, each NVP measure was regressed on the control variables and the five TS factors.
In Step 3, interactions of the TS factors with the four environmental dimensions were
added to the control and independent variables already in the equation, and the analysis
was re-run. Interaction terms were created by multiplying each of the four environmental dimensions by the five TS factors.
To maintain sufficient degrees of freedom, four separate regression analyses were
performed for each NVP measure. In the first run (Step 3.1), only the interactions of
dynamism with the five TS factors were added to the equation. In the second and third
runs (Steps 3.2 and 3.3), the interaction terms for price and non-price hostility were
entered into the analysis, respectively. The final run (Step 3.4), interaction terms formed
by multiplying heterogeneity and TS factors, were added to the equation. This procedure was appropriate because the hypotheses focused on the impact of specific interactions on NVP, rather than examining all the interactions between a venture’s external
environment and TS factors. The results for ROE appear in Table 6, while the results
for GMS appear in Table 7.

RESULTS
ROE
As Table 6 shows, neither the regression equation nor the four control variables were
significant in Step 1. The equation explained a modest 3% of the variance in ROE. In
Step 2, when the five TS measures were entered as a block, the equation became significant (p , 0.05) and had an adjusted R 2 of 11%. Radicality, product upgrades, and external sources were positively and significantly associated with ROE (p , 0.05 or better).
The results for dynamism appear under Step 3.1 (Table 6), where the equation was
significant. Three dynamism*TS interaction terms were also significant and positive:
radicality, product upgrades, and external sources. Step 3.2, which focused on price hostility, was also significant. When the price hostility*TS interactions were considered,
the coefficient for the external sources was positive and significant, but the coefficient
product upgrades were negative and significant. Step 3.3, which examined non-price
hostility, was significant and the coefficients for product upgrades and the use of external
sources were positive and significant. Finally, in Step 3.4, the equation for heterogeneity
was significant and the interaction of heterogeneity with R&D spending, product upgrades, the external sources, and the use of copyrights had positive and significant coefficients.6
6
To validate the results reported above, moderated regression analysis was re-run for ROE and the
market share growth measures. In these analyses, all the 20 interaction terms (constructed by multiplying
the 4 environment dimensions by the 5 TS factors) were entered simultaneously as a block in Step 3. The
regressions explained 29.6% of ROE and 32.9% of market share growth, respectively. Significant interaction
terms in these regression were similar to those found in Tables 6 and 7.

Moderated regression analysis was also performed using the new venture’s GMS as the

The results in Table 7 show that the equation and the four control variables were not

product upgrades, external technology sources, and the use of copyrights.

positive and significant, whereas the interactions for radicality and R&D spending were
negative and significant. When non-price hostility was considered (Step 3.3), the equation was significant, and the interactions terms for R&D spending and product upgrades

technology.7 These results and their implications for theory and practice are discussed
in detail in the following section.

DISCUSSION
The effect of technology strategy on new venture performance has been the subject of
much interest in the literature. This study shows that a new venture’s TS can significantly
impact its performance and that the external environment moderates the TS-NVP relationship. These results also help to identify the factors that lead to the success or failure
of young, high technology companies. This section reviews the study’s major findings.

THE ASSOCIATION OF TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY WITH NVP
Three observations are evident from the results on the TS-NVP relationship. First, a
formal TS is significantly associated with the venture’s ROE and GMS. While the modest adjusted R 2 values found in both equations indicate that other organizational variables (e.g., structure, resources, and culture) and competitive choices (e.g., manufacturing) may influence performance, the venture’s TS positively and significantly impacts
NVP. Second, three technological choices are significantly associated with both the venture’s ROE and GMS: radicality of the firm’s new products, frequent product upgrades,
and the use of external technology sources. These results support the importance of the
radicality of the venture’s new products (Kerin et al. 1992), frequent upgrades (Dodgson
1993), and the use of the external sources of technology (Leonard-Barton 1995) for
achieving superior performance. Though most past research on these variables was conducted in established companies, the results corroborate these findings in the context
of young software companies.
Other results, however, were generally inconsistent with expectations. Specifically,
the ventures’ use of patents and copyrights was only significantly and positively associated with GMS (p , 0.05), but not with ROE. Perhaps, software ventures use their
copyrights to achieve goals other than increasing their short-term profits, such as entering into beneficial strategic alliances to market and distribute their products.

THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AS A MODERATOR OF THE
TS-NVP RELATIONSHIP
The results of the interactions between the TS dramatize and the external environmental moderators give further insights into the drivers of NVP in the U.S. software industry.
7
Given the range of the age of new ventures presented in the sample, we conducted additional analyses
to determine the robustness of the study’s findings. We reasoned that the early years of a venture’s life cycle
(say, before year 3), focus will center on acquiring resources and building the ventures’ market network and
linkages. To identify the differences associated with the ventures’ age, we analyzed the data for the following
four groups: 3–8, 4–8, 5–8, and 6–8 years. Overall, the results indicated that the relationships between the
ventures’ TS and performance (using both ROE and GMS) were not significantly related in the earlier years
(3–8 and 4–8 age groups). However, for ventures in the 5–8 age range or later, the results mirrored those
reported in the text, with two notable exceptions. The effect of R&D and external sources on ROE and GMS
became stronger over time, which is consistent with the literature on technological learning (Dodgson 1993;
Helfat 1994; Zahra 1996). These results appeared to suggest that new ventures became more proficient in
transforming their own R&D as well as external sources of technological know how into a source of competitive advantage.

To ensure clarity, Table 8 summarizes the study’s results relative to the hypotheses.
The results are discussed below.

Dynamism
The results support three of the five sets of hypotheses (H1a, H1b, and H1d) on the
moderating effect of dynamism, as shown by the positive and significant associations

<-----Page 29----->164

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

found between both measures of NVP and the measures of product radicality, product
upgrades, and external sources of technology. The results, therefore, reinforce the importance of radical new products, frequent product upgrades (Prusa and Schmitz 1994),
and the use of external technology sources (Dodgson 1993) for high NVP in a dynamic
competitive environment.
The results do not support H1c1 and H1c2, which suggest a positive association
between R&D spending and NVP. Although R&D has the expected positive signs, it
is not significant in the regression analyses. Thus, although R&D spending is important
for frequent product upgrades, it may not in itself lead to short-term financial or market
share gains in a dynamic environment, which supports prior research (Link and Tassey
1987; Zahra et al. 1995). In some dynamic markets, new ventures may have to spend
heavily on R&D to simply achieve short-term competitive parity and keep up with the
rapid pace of technological change.
Contrary to H1e1 and H1e2, a venture’s use of patents and copyrights is not significantly associated with the two NVP measures. Thus, when the environment is dynamic,
some ventures may not benefit financially from aggressively pursuing patents (copyrights) to protect their discoveries. This finding is consistent with the study (Rogers and
Rogers 1984) of Silicon Valley hardware manufacturers which concluded that, in this
dynamic environment, some firms believed that the use of patents (copyrights) actually
quickened the speed with which competitors imitated their innovations. In the dynamic
software industry, radically new products and upgrades are being introduced at a breathtaking pace, which makes the use of copyrights a futile activity for new ventures that
do not always have the resources to obtain these copyrights. Obtaining legal protection
of the firm’s intellectual property might take years to complete, which can further
weaken the value of this approach to protecting a new venture’s competitive advantage
(U.S. Industrial Outlook 1994). Consequently, in some dynamic industries, traditional
approaches to protecting intellectual property are becoming less effective (The Economist 1996), while their costs remain high. Thus, using copyrights may be ineffective in
dynamic industries such as software.
In summary, these results partially supported the predicted moderating effect of
venture’s dynamic environment on the TS-NVP relationship. The results also highlighted some of the limits of conventional theory when applied to software new ventures.
This point is further reinforced by the results on hostility, as discussed next.

Hostility
The study also helped to sort out the contradictory findings reported in past research
on the moderating effect of perceived hostility on the TS-NVP relationship. They
showed that hostility moderates the relationship between a venture’s TS and its performance, albeit in ways that sometimes differed significantly from the hypotheses derived
from conventional theory. Perhaps, the separation of hostility into two factors: price
and non-price, provided an opportunity to untangle the specific associations of those
variables with a venture’s TS. The results were understandable given the study’s focus
on new ventures in a young industry, in contrast to past research that examined established companies in mature industries (e.g., Zahra and Covin 1993). Either way, the
results offered a richer view of the impact of the interaction of hostility with TS on NVP.
The results offered limited support for H2a1 and H2a2, showing that offering radically new products is negatively associated with ROE in environments dominated by

<-----Page 30----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

165

price and non-price hostility. Although not significant in either environmental setting,
these negative signs were consistent with theoretical expectations that intense hostility
in these markets might make aggressive gambling of new ventures’ limited financial resources by offering radically innovative products a poor strategic choice. These results
also supported the literature (Slater and Narver 1994).
The results for GMS were a bit more compelling than those reported above for
the ventures’ ROE. In support of H2a3, there was a negative and significant association
between offering radically new products and GMS when price-based hostility was high,
possibly because of the drain radical product innovations might place on the venture’s
limited resources. In partial support of H2a4, offering radically new products was positively associated with GMS in a non-price hostile environment, although the regression
coefficient was not significant.
Consistent with H2b1, frequent product upgrades were negatively and significantly
associated with lower ROE when price hostility was high. These upgrades were positively associated with ROE when non-price hostility was high, which supports H2b2.
For GMS, the results supported both H2b3 and H2b4. Thus, regardless of the impact
on ROE, offering more product upgrades had a significant and positive impact on the
new ventures’ GMS. Managers should note that two of the three positive associations
were in non-price hostile settings, where product line extensions and upgrades would
be key tools in the venture’s TS (Grant 1995). This suggested that in price-hostile environments frequent product upgrades were positively associated with GMS, but might
reduce ROE. Consequently, the long-term versus short-term implications of product
upgrades might be significant considerations for managers in price-hostile competitive
settings where the pursuit of short-run returns can backfire (Iansiti 1995).
The relationship between R&D spending and NVP may be more complex than
previously portrayed in the literature. Consistent with H2c3, when price hostility was
high, R&D spending was significantly and negatively associated with GMS, but there
was an insignificant positive association with ROE—which failed to support H2c1. In
this environment, ROE and R&D were expected to be negatively associated. The results
also showed that when non-price hostility was high, R&D spending was positively associated with GMS, which supported H2c4. Under high non-price hostility, the associations between R&D and ROE was positive but not significant, which contradicts H2c2.
Although this positive sign was in the predicted direction, it is not significant. Because
the results may be industry specific, research was needed to validate the findings. Meanwhile, the results emphasize the importance of R&D spending for acquiring market
share where non-price competition existed, where such spending could fuel a venture’s
market share growth.
The results generally supported the expected positive associations between a venture’s use of external sources of technology and NVP. Three of the four regression coefficients were significant and positive, as predicted. These the results support H2d1,
H2d2, and H2d3, but failed to support H2d4 which suggested a positive association between the use of external sources and GMS. Although the interaction of external
sources and non-price hostility was positive, it was not significantly associated with
GMS. However, when hostility was high, those ventures that linked with external technology sources reported higher NVP, which was consistent with some prior findings
(Dodgson 1993).
Hypotheses 2e1–4, which specified the nature of the associations between protecting the venture’s intellectual property and NVP when hostility was high, were not

<-----Page 31----->166

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

supported. Although three of the four regression coefficients were in the predicted direction, none of them was significant. Interestingly, the negative signs observed in H2e1
through H2e3 were consistent with expectations. These signs might have reflected the
high cost of copyrights, the time it took the venture to obtain copyrights, and the possibility that copyrighting the venture’s products does not preclude imitation by rivals.
Those ventures that were effective patenting their innovations might even risk leaking
information quickly to their rivals. Consequently, consistent with some recent writings
(Grant 1995), spending a venture’s resources on obtaining copyrights (patents) might
be counterproductive when environmental hostility is high. Overall, although hostility
significantly moderated the TS-NVP relationship, this moderating effect appeared to
work in different ways in different contexts (price vs. non-price hostility). These interactions also varied significantly from the general patterns suggested by research that examined the TS used by established companies.

Heterogeneity
The results also highlighted the role of perceived environmental heterogeneity as a significant moderator of the TS-NVP relationship. As indicated in Table 8, three of the
five predicted sets of associations between TS and NVP in this environment were supported. As reported earlier, the interactions of heterogeneity with product upgrades
(H3b1 and 2), R&D spending (H3c1 and 2) and the use of external technology sources
(H3d1 and 2) were positively and significantly associated with the venture’s ROE and
GMS. Success in a heterogeneous environment, therefore, appeared to depend on the
venture’s ability to fund and maintain a strong program of research that leads to frequent product upgrades (Miller 1987), while making extensive use of external technology sources (Hagedoorn 1993).
The results also showed that the new venture’s use of copyrights (patents) was significantly associated with ROE, which supported H3c1. Consequently, H3e was partially
supported, indicating that software new ventures that were active in copyrighting (or
patenting) their technologies might benefit significantly from this effort. These benefits
were not as strong as those gained from other TS dimensions, because any single patent
might be narrow in scope and its potential impact on the venture’s financial or market
share gains might be limited.
The hypothesized positive association between new product radicality and NVP
in a heterogeneous environment (H3a1 and 2) was not supported. Specifically, product
radicality had positive but insignificant signs in the regression analyses for both ROE
and GMS. Thus, radicality per se may not impact short-term NVP in a heterogeneous
environment as strongly as theory would suggest (e.g., Kerin et al. 1992). Perhaps, the
financial benefits from product radicality were greater for the industry’s early entrants
than for newcomers. As new segments of software users emerge, the early entrants’
known names and established channels might enable them to retain any competitive
advantages derived from offering radically new products (Zahra et al. 1995). This possibility should be examined in future research.

Limitations
Although the above findings provide several new insights, they also showed a need for
further research on the moderating impact of a venture’s environment on the relation-

<-----Page 32----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

167

ship between its TS and performance. Moving beyond this study’s cross-sectional sample, future researchers can longitudinally explore the causal relationships among the
TS and NVP within specific environments. Further, data from other industries, analyzed
in the same way, can add significantly to the general nature of the findings. Researchers
should also recognize the limitations of the data provided by the CEOs, as these data
might suffer from survivor bias.
One of the study’s limitations was that it did not directly examine the direct effect
of a venture’s resources on TS or on the TS-NVP relationships. The venture’s tangible
(e.g., marketing) and intangible (e.g., reputation and culture) resources can determine
to the strategic options available to the new venture (Bogner and Thomas 1996), and
influence the commercialization of new products (technologies), which influences a venture’s competitive advantage. Rare and inimitable resources can allow the venture to
create and introduce highly differentiated products, thereby protecting a venture’s competitive advantage. The abundance of slack resources (e.g., excess capital) can also promote the development of radically innovative products. Intangible resources (e.g., social
capital) can also improve the odds of successful technology commercialization. Consequently, by ignoring the direct effect of resources, this study might have overlooked
a key determinant of the venture’s TS. Further, since resources can temporarily buffer
the venture from adverse environmental conditions the type and size of these resources
can influence the moderating influences of the environment on the TS-NVP relationships.
Finally, as noted earlier, data were collected for the same three year period preceding the administration of the survey, limiting our ability to infer cause-effect relationships among the study’s variables. Therefore, the results are best interpreted as suggesting associations among these variables at one point in time. Despite these
limitations, the results suggest several possible managerial actions, as follows.

IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERIAL ACTION AND
FUTURE RESEARCH
Managerial Implications
As the results indicate, new ventures in growth industries such as software can benefit
greatly from developing and pursuing a comprehensive TS. This is evident from the
fact that several dimensions of TS are significantly related to both the venture’s ROE
and GMS. Entrepreneurs and venture managers, however, frequently forget that having
a good product or a sophisticated technology alone does not always guarantee success
in the marketplace (Bell and McNamara 1991; McGrath 1994). TS must be a part of
a comprehensive strategy to manage that technology as an ongoing, living resource that
must fit the venture’s particular competitive environment.
The results also indicate that a key part of a TS for entrepreneurs and managers
is the interaction of that strategy with the ventures’ external environment. This requires
the active scanning and monitoring of the venture’s different sectors of the environment
and collecting data about their conditions. Managers must also interpret relevant environmental forces and forecast how each may impact the venture’s TS choices. To ensure
accurate interpretations, managers need to monitor and scan their environments and
analyze their competition. These analyses can help to align managers’ views with the
objective conditions of their environment and markets, thus setting the stage for tech-

<-----Page 33----->168

S.A. ZAHRA AND W.C. BOGNER

nology and strategic planning premises. Only after such a thorough analysis of the environment is completed can managers choose those technological capabilities that can
best enhance their venture’s performance. Failure to conduct an effective analysis of
the environment or excessive reliance on informal means of collecting data about the
industry can jeopardize the venture’s technological strategies, which might be misaligned with the needs of the market.
The study also suggests that the technological capabilities that must be considered
in assessing the fit between the venture’s strategy and environment is not limited to the
firm’s internal resources. Managers need to tap both the internal and external sources
of technological capabilities when managing environmental challenges. Yet, entrepreneurs and venture managers sometimes fail to cultivate the external sources of technology and use them to create new products (technologies). Despite the benefits of developing the venture’s internal sources, it unrealistic to expect a young company to possess
all the technological capabilities it needs to compete in a dynamic industry. Given the
rapid pace of obsolescence, therefore, a venture should complement its capabilities by
using external sources of technology.
Managers need also to recognize both the contributions and serious limitations of
legal means of protecting their intellectual capital. As noted previously, the value of
patents and copyrights appears to vary significantly from one environmental setting to
another. New ventures should use trade secrets and other means to protect the venture’s
innovations. Constant innovation is another viable approach to protecting the venture’s
innovative technologies.
Finally, managers need to recognize that the various dimensions of TS interact with
each other in a dynamic sense. Given this interconnectedness, a change in one variable
therefore can change the nature of the competitive setting in which a venture finds itself.
Firms, therefore, have to deal with the environment as a whole cannot simply alter only
one variable in isolation. Future researchers therefore would benefit from adopting a
holistic view of the interactions among the TS dimensions.

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
In addition to the refinements already suggested throughout this paper, the study draws
attention for additional research on new ventures’ TS. As many industries owe their
existence to the foresight and innovation of new ventures, understanding how these
ventures use their technological capabilities to gain a competitive advantage is fast becoming a worthwhile research issue. Future studies can further clarify the relationships
between the dimensions of TS and NVP and document the changes that may occur in
this relationship over time.
This study has added to our understanding of the associations of a new ventures
technology strategy. Results show that some of these dimensions support one another.
Examples include radical new products and R&D investments, strong R&D spending,
and the use of external resources. This is important because new venture managers can
capitalize on the interdependencies among the dimensions of the venture’s TS and build
an effective competitive approach using their firms technological capabilities. Theoretically this study shows that we should not presume a priori that TS dimensions will conflict with one another requiring managers to make significant tradeoffs.
Future empirical research on the relationship between the ventures’ TS and NVP is
needed also to identify the contextual variables that affect the payoff from technological

<-----Page 34----->TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND SOFTWARE NEW VENTURES’ PERFORMANCE

169

choices. Researchers need to track new ventures over time and examine their technological choices in different stages of growth (e.g., Hamilton and Singh 1992) or across the
different stages of an industry’s life cycle (e.g., Auster 1992). Longitudinal analyses can
help to document evolutionary patterns in new ventures’ TS. Previous researchers (e.g.,
Helfat 1994; Kotabe and Swan 1995; Singh 1992) who have called for such dynamic analyses of TS variables and relate them to changes in NVP. These studies can help also
in identifying the side effects of the venture’s use of external technology sources.
Another issue to consider in future studies is the moderating role of the breadth
(scope) of the venture’s business on the TS-NVP relationships in different environments. Although this study has treated business scope as a control variable, Porter (1980,
1983) suggests that it shapes the firm’s strategic choices, especially TS. Scope also influences the venture’s performance (Grant 1995).8
The nature of interactions among the TS variables should be further explored. As
pointed out in the previous section, environmental conditions leading to such interactions among the variables are not only anticipated, they are likely inevitable. Only by
developing a richer understanding of these interactions can the full impact of the prescriptions for each TS variable be understood.
Finally, as noted earlier, most new ventures have resource constraints that might
influence their TS choices. Although this study has used venture origin as a proxy for
differences in resource endowments, researchers should consider more direct measures
of venture capitalization and explore the effect of this variable on TS. Researchers need
also to link a venture’s resource pool to its TS choices within different environments
and clarify the effective interplay between a firm’s resources, strategy and performance
in different environments.
Measuring the tangible and intangible resources of a new venture is a demanding
task. In this study we have explicitly measured R&D resources. Understanding how
a new venture uses its technological resources to build a competitive advantage is an
important issue that requires careful analysis and direct measures of these resources
in future studies.
Given that the current study’s results are based on reports by managers of their
perceptions of the environment, there is a need to further explore the link between the
objective qualities of the environment and the ventures’ TS; managers’ perceptions of
their environments do not always reflect the objective attributes of their markets and
industries. By examining the impact of the environment’s objective qualities (Dess &
Beard 1984) and managers’ perceptions, researchers can establish the relative contributions of these two sets of variables on TS or explore the effect of the mismatch between
these objective qualities and perceptions on the payoff from the venture’s TS. Such mis8
To gain a better appreciation of the moderating role of business scope on the study’s hypotheses, the
sample was split at the median into narrow versus broad business scope. Separate analyses were rerun for
each subgroup. In terms of dynamism, the results showed that those ventures with broad scope had higher
coefficients than ventures with narrow scope on the following hypotheses: H1b1, H1b2, H1c1, and H1d1.
Ventures with narrow scope had significantly higher coefficients than ventures with broad scope in the case
of H1d2. In terms of hostility, narrow scope ventures had a significantly higher coefficient with regard to
H2a1 (more negative effect), H2b1 (more negative effect), H2d2, and H2d4. Ventures with broad scope had
significantly higher coefficients than ventures with narrow scope on the following: H2b1, H2b2, H2c3, and
H2d1. Finally, the results for heterogeneity indicated that ventures with broad scope had significantly higher
coefficients than the other ventures on: H3b1, H3c1, H3c2, H3d1, and H3d2. The opposite was true in the
case of H3a1 and H3a2, where the coefficients for ventures with narrow scope were higher than those with
broad scope.

match, which may arise from ineffective competitive analyses, poor environmental analyses, managers’ cognitive biases, or managerial hubris, can lead ventures to pursue ineffective TS, a factor that cause the demise of new firms.
The process by which new ventures develop and deploy their TS is another area
that requires additional research to answer several basic questions: How are the various
aspects of TS integrated to create a competitive advantage? How are the firm’s perceptions of the competitive environment factored in making these choices? How are adjustments in the venture’s TS made over time and by whom? Answering these questions
can be useful in documenting the evolutionary changes that may occur in the firm’s TS.
The longitudinal studies prescribed above can be especially helpful in this regard.
New ventures have contributed significantly to the technological progress of the
U.S. by creating and commercializing innovative products, services, and goods. Gaining
an enduring competitive advantage from these products requires new ventures to pursue technology strategies that match the conditions of their external environment. Further empirical research is needed to determine the precise nature of the interactions
between the new ventures’ environments and technological strategies, and how these
interactions may influence these firm’s performance. We hope that the current results
will encourage further research on these issues.
