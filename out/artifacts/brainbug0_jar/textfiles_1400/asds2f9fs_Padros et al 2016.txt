INTRODUCTION
The use of research evidence to facilitate
improvements in healthcare quality continues to be a topic widely debated by
scholars and practitioners.1 2 The
concept of ‘knowledge mobilisation’ has
been developed, with strategies to help
bridge this gap.3 These strategies include
the development of “a culture of partnership between academic researchers and
decision-makers to assist in strengthening
the development of policy, practice and
social innovation, or the co-production
of knowledge”.3 4 It is based on the
premise that knowledge that is collected
and created ‘on the ground’, through
daily interaction and negotiation with
practitioners, managers and service
users,4 will provide better insight into the
issues affecting these stakeholders, be
more relevant to the local context and
will, therefore, be more easily incorporated into changes in practice.5–11
Different strategies have been used
internationally to promote knowledge
coproduction.12 Several of these strategies entail the creation of partnerships
between academic and healthcare organisations.13–19 In some cases, these partnerships use ‘boundary spanners’,19 20
‘knowledge brokers’21 or other intermediary roles,5 where individuals work
to link practitioners with knowledge and
develop organisational capacity to carry
out and incorporate research into practice.18 22 One type of intermediary role is
the embedded researcher. There are multiple definitions of embedded research
and one of the goals of this review is to
explore the wide range of meanings associated with this term. However, as a starting point, we used the definition
proposed by McGinity and Salokangas,23
where embedded researchers are defined
as those who work inside host organisations as members of staff, while also

maintaining an affiliation with an academic institution. Their task is seen as
collaborating with teams within the
organisation to identify, design and
conduct research studies and share findings which respond to the needs of the
organisation, and accord with the organisation’s unique context and culture.23
The role of embedded researchers differs
from that of knowledge brokers and
boundary spanners. Embedded researchers may use techniques used by knowledge brokers such as knowledge
management, linkage and exchange and
capacity building (based on the definition
of knowledge broker used by5 6 21).
Furthermore, they might operate as
‘boundary spanners’ in the sense that
they work across organisational boundaries.5 However, their main purpose is to
carry out research, to coproduce knowledge. The research is therefore produced
through a collaborative and participative
process, and it is jointly ‘owned’.23
The use of embedded researchers
within and outside of healthcare appears
to be a growing practice,14 but, to our
knowledge, there are no published
reviews of the characteristics of this
approach, its potential role and the challenges it might face. Therefore, this
review addresses the following questions.
What are the characteristics of embedded
research? What is the potential role for
embedded researchers to facilitate
improvement research that makes a difference? What are the challenges of such
models? How can the lessons learned by
embedded researchers in other sectors be
applied to embedded research in healthcare? Our review synthesises the available
literature on the experiences of researchers using the embedded research approach
and presents a series of lessons learned for
its application to research aimed at quality
improvement in healthcare.

Narrative review
METHODS
We carried out a narrative review24–26 to explore the role
that embedded researchers could play in improvement
efforts in healthcare. We conducted a two-stage bibliographic search of publications in English from 1937 to
November 2015 using MEDLINE, Web of Science,
PsychInfo, ProQuest Social Science and CINAHL Plus.
In the first stage, we used the following search terms:
‘embedded research’ OR ‘embedded researcher’ OR
‘embedded researchers’ OR ‘researcher-in-residence’
OR ‘researcher in residence’ OR ‘boundary spanners’ OR
‘boundary spanner’. We included ‘boundary spanner’ as
a search term to account for the work of researchers
working across multiple organisations as this was an
important aspect of the definition of embedded research
we used as a starting point.23 Due to the contested
nature of the definition of embedded research, we
carried out a second stage of the search based on the
identification of terms used in the articles that we
included in the first stage of the review. These terms
were: ‘intermediaries’ OR ‘transient government officials’
OR ‘embedded scientist’ OR ‘engaged scholar’ OR
‘knowledge broker’. In the same way, we iterated our
search terms in this two-stage process, we also applied
the working definition of embedded research outlined
above flexibly in order to capture the wide range of
approaches being employed in this emerging field (see
under ‘Defining embedded research’ in Results section).
We conducted a review of bibliographies to identify
further relevant publications and hand-searched the
following journals: BMJ, BMJ Quality and Safety,
Anthropology in Action, BMC Health Services
Research and Implementation Science. These journals
were selected based on our findings of the initial
searches. Results were combined into RefWorks, and
duplicates were removed.
The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed journal
articles focused on the embedded research approach
both within and outside healthcare. The latter was
included because the reflections on the process of carrying out research as part of an organisation in other
sectors may be valuable for healthcare research. We
excluded publications that were published in languages other than English.
The exclusion criteria are presented in figure 1. The
included articles were analysed using a data extraction
form developed in RedCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture), which was created after the initial screening
of full-text27 articles (see online supplementary
appendix 1). We analysed the content of the articles
in relation to the questions set out above. In addition,
we captured themes emerging from the articles to
include relevant issues not covered by our initial
research questions.
RESULTS
The first search yielded 360 published articles (see
figure 1). The articles were screened in RefWorks by

2

two of the authors (CV-P and TP) based on title, language, general topic, and type of publication, resulting
in a total of 154 articles. Screening based on abstracts
resulted in 38 articles for full-text review. The review
of bibliographies yielded six more articles. The second
search yielded 4173 articles; initial screening based on
title led to 70 articles. Screening based on abstracts
resulted in 20 articles for full-text review (see figure 1).
The number of articles included for full-text review
from both search stages was 64. After the full-text
review, 47 articles were excluded. Seventeen articles
were included in the final selection.
Our review of the literature indicates that the
embedded research approach is an emerging trend
within and beyond healthcare. Table 1 contains a
description of the publications included in the review.
The review contains eight healthcare-related publications and nine non-healthcare-related publications.
Defining embedded research

There is currently a wide spectrum of research activities that share characteristics that embody ‘embedded
research’. While our working definition included a
requirement that embedded researchers need to have
dual affiliation (to an academic institution and the
host organisation),23 we found that five of the articles
included in the review did not discuss issues of dual
affiliation. These articles, however, satisfied all of the
other characteristics outlined in our working definition. One additional article clearly stated that the
researchers were not affiliated to an academic institution while they were embedded. We included this
article because the authors reflect on the positive and
negative aspects of not having this dual affiliation.
The approach we envision as embedded research is
still in early stages of development, but despite variations in the affiliation of researchers, a series of
common features can be identified (see box 1).
Becoming part of the organisation

Lewis and Russell37 regard it as essential that the
researcher undergoes a process of immersion within
his or her host organisation. By ‘being there,’ the
researcher is able to grasp the challenges faced by the
organisation, its goals and interests and the contexts
where these play out.23 36 37
One of the main challenges of improving the
quality of healthcare is the development of an organisational culture that is supportive and committed to
improvement.1 As Dixon-Woods et al1 have argued,
“problems can occur when improvement efforts run
counter to centrally driven national pushes and pressures or are introduced into environments already
suffering organisational stress from mandated
requirements”. By being immersed in the organisation,
the embedded researcher can gain greater understanding of the pressures and problems faced at different

levels of the organisation and tailor improvement
strategies accordingly.14 23
Developing relationships with staff

Physical presence alone is not enough to become an
embedded researcher. As Wong34 highlights, an
important component of ‘embeddedness’ lies in the
quality and types of relationships the researchers
foster with staff. Through these relationships, the
researchers gain trust and are seen as members of the
team.29 34 39 Their positionality, or the way researchers see themselves and are seen by others in the organisation, varies in relation to the people involved and
the context.37 In his embedded work, Duggan39
Vindrola-Padros C, et al. BMJ Qual Saf 2016;0:1–11. doi:10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004877

established different collaborative relationships, such
as: ‘critical friendship’ (working in equal relation to
the project manager), ‘critical nephewship’ (working
in a junior position) and ‘critical orphanship’
(unattached to the project team). These relationships
allowed him to reach out and capture the views of
staff at different levels of management, acting as an
equal with some staff and in a more subordinate position with others. When acting as an ‘unattached’
researcher, he had more flexibility to participate in
new activities within the organisation.
Establishing collaborative relationships with local
teams is important for uncovering the different viewpoints of staff members regarding the issues faced by

the organisation and how they could be addressed.
This insight into the wide range of perspectives coexisting in the organisation can allow the researcher to
make research findings more relevant to local end
users, promote ownership of these findings and anticipate potential sources of tension produced by competing views.38 Improvement initiatives in healthcare
frequently (but by no means always) emerge from the
interests of senior groups within organisations who
have particular ideas about the problems faced by the
organisation, their causes and the best ways to solve
them. These initiatives are often developed without
the involvement of those who will experience changes
in their daily practice and are imposed as a top-down
measure.42 As a consequence, they often fail.1 The
spread of innovations can also encounter similar
obstacles when it is meant to intersect different
groups and cross professional boundaries.43
Embedded researchers seek to tackle this issue of
top-down approaches by considering the fact that
each organisation has multiple subgroups with their
own views of how the organisation works and how
services should be organised.36 37 By working with
these groups on an ongoing basis, embedded researchers are able to understand the complexity of the situations faced by the organisation and propose strategies
that respond to the interests of a wider range of
stakeholders.38
Critical reflection by the researcher and local team

Some authors argue that the creation of these collaborative relationships can be enriched when the
researcher employs a reflexive approach.23 37 38
Reflexivity entails a conscious exercise of thinking
about the position the researcher occupies as an individual, and as part of the organisational context.37
Reflexivity helps the researcher maintain a clearer idea
of their role and capacity to intervene.38 It also supports a continuous reassessment and adjustment of the
researcher’s practice.34 When researchers are able to
foster individual reflexivity, they become aware of
potential barriers to the research process, and can
thus adapt research activities to address the needs and
7

Narrative review
interests of all involved parties, and create stronger
relationships with the people participating in the
research project.37 34 Furthermore, when shared with
other members of the team in the form of collective
reflexivity, this exercise provides a way of fostering
critical thinking within the team even after the
researcher leaves the organisation—a form of capacity
building.34
Informing practice

Some have argued that in the traditional model of
research, there is a disconnection between ‘producers’
and ‘consumers’ of research evidence.3 44 45 As a consequence, organisational decision-making is not
always informed by health service research evidence.3
One of the goals of embedded research is the rapid
delivery of research findings and their quicker incorporation into improvements in practice.14 Due to their
immersion within the organisation, embedded
researchers can produce research that is more relevant
to the ‘end user’ and can give advice and flag issues in
formal and informal ways.37 34
Having regular meetings with clinical teams and
management groups to discuss progress of their work
is proposed as a useful mechanism for the provision
of iterative feedback.34 Such meetings are about discussing the research progress and maintaining relationships, and also about ensuring that all relevant
members of the host organisation still feel they ‘own’
the problem, and will be willing to own the solution,
too. The process of engaging staff to own the problem
and support service improvement has been widely discussed in the healthcare quality improvement literature. Dixon-Woods and colleagues have argued that
‘soft’ and ‘hard’ tools might be needed to persuade
staff to change current practices in healthcare organisations.1 46 Gollop et al47 have indicated that individualised and tailored influencing techniques, such as
finding the right ‘hook’ when making the case for
change, might be required to reduce some healthcare
professionals’ scepticism and resistance to service
improvement.
Embedded researchers can use their presence and
daily working relationships to implement some of
these ‘soft persuasive tools’. The researcher might
facilitate meetings, provide technical assistance to
solve problems and share their knowledge of the
research evidence. They might tailor feedback by
weaving in the host organisation’s own words or
letting actors from the host organisation take the lead.
Due to their knowledge of the organisation’s
context and culture, the researcher is able to share the
findings in relation to the wider issues at stake in the
organisation, such as the need to scale-up interventions or combine the study with wider improvement
initiatives taking place across the organisation.34 37
Furthermore, the researcher identifies and describes
problems, and also cases of good practice,34 thereby
8

helping to empower teams to continue with work that
is producing positive outcomes.
Capacity building

In many cases, embedded researchers help build
research capacity so that the benefits of embedded
research extend beyond the researcher’s direct
involvement. Capacity building might include promoting a reflexive culture before launching new initiatives, creating awareness of less well-known ways to
approach problems, establishing a research culture,
teaching evaluation skills or assisting in applications
for external funding.14 34 35 In contrast to other
research approaches that tend to be based on the
development of individual partnerships between
researchers and staff, the embedded approach centres
on the incorporation of research into the organisation’s systems, processes and practices, thus promoting
its sustainability over time.32 35
It is argued that embedded research also develops
capacity at universities. It provides researchers with
the opportunity to test methods and theories in practice—thus enhancing their applicability to real-life circumstances.14 23 39 Furthermore, the experience of
working alongside healthcare professionals will help
researchers later in their academic careers to design
studies that generate insights helpful for healthcare
organisations.23 33 36
The challenges of carrying out embedded research

Carrying out rigorous research within healthcare organisations is challenging. For instance, some authors
mention their hesitation when contemplating designing research that could potentially lead to negative
results or highlight undesirable qualities of the host
organisation.34 When attempting to disseminate findings, researchers might be bound by internal regulations that prevent them from publishing information
considered harmful by the host organisation.36 The
dual affiliation of many embedded researchers places
them in a state of ‘in-between-ness,’ where they have
to show their commitment to the organisation’s goals
and to the academic standards established for conducting publishable research in their fields.37 38 This
resembles the issues discussed in the literature on
intermediary and boundary roles and the presence of
role tensions or ‘role strain,’ a situation created when
individuals have to deal with competing demands generated by members of the organisations they are
affiliated to.48 49
One way to deal with the challenges connected with
dual affiliation is to agree on clear guidelines from the
beginning to manage expectations.50 The guidelines
might define the role of the researcher, types of
studies they will be able to undertake, study timeframes and feedback processes.14 34 Other embedded
researchers have indicated that even if the researcher
does not have an affiliation with an academic

Narrative review
Box 2 Lessons learned from the use of embedded
researchers within and outside of the healthcare
sector
1. The embedded researcher needs to consider the
experiences and points of view of the different subgroups within the organisation.
2. The creation of collaborative relationships with staff
in the local organisation and the coproduction of
knowledge can be enriched by practicing ‘reflexivity’
(reflecting on own position as an individual and as
part of the organisational context).
3. Clear guidelines should be agreed between the
embedded researcher and the local organisation from
the beginning to manage expectations.
4. The researcher should schedule regular meeting with
clinical teams and management groups to provide
iterative feedback.
5. It is important for embedded researchers to maintain
links with academic institutions to preserve a critical
perspective.
institution, it is important for him or her to maintain
regular dialogue with academics about his or her
research.29 37 A connection with academia allows
embedded researchers to keep up to date on new
trends, preserve a critical perspective and make sure
their research is rigorous.37 It has also been recommended that embedded researchers should foster relationships with other researchers doing similar work
and share lessons of how to manage day-to-day
issues.29
This review has highlighted a number of lessons
that may be useful for embedded researchers, and
these are summarised in box 2.
Limitations of this review

This review has a number of limitations. There is a
lack of consensus around the terminology used to
refer to embedded research. Our search terms and
screening process might not have captured all of the
relevant articles.
CONCLUSION
Embedded research has the potential to address some
of the main challenges in using research to improve
quality in healthcare: understanding organisational
culture to focus research appropriately, securing
engagement from staff at different levels of the organisation to ensure the findings of research are translated
into changes in practice and promoting the sustainability of improvement interventions.1 As Gold has
argued, “in organisations, take up of ideas often
occurs through informal processes”.51 The continuous
presence of embedded researchers in healthcare organisations allows for the creation of these informal
Vindrola-Padros C, et al. BMJ Qual Saf 2016;0:1–11. doi:10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004877

processes. The coproduction of knowledge between
embedded researchers and local teams can lead to
greater ‘ownership’ of the research findings by the
healthcare organisation, and consequently, could lead
to a smoother incorporation into changes in practice.
The development of the research skills of local teams
can help ensure research is viewed favourably and
used within the organisation even after the embedded
researchers have left.
Embedded research involves its own challenges in
terms of dual affiliation, relationship building and
sharing of results. Given our focus on the embedded
research model as a method of coproducing research
knowledge, we believe that maintaining a dual affiliation with health and academic organisations will represent a core component of embedded research.
Learning from the experience of embedded researchers in different organisational contexts, and from the
organisations they work with, could contribute
further to our understanding of this approach.
Rigorous evaluation of embedded research initiatives
is required, which includes assessing the costs and
benefits of embedded research for healthcare
organisations.
