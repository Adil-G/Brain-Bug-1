Time and decision making in humans
FLORIAN KLAPPROTH
Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany
Decision making requires evaluating alternatives that differ on a number of attributes. During this evaluation
process, selection of options depends on the duration of the options, the duration of the expected delay for realizing the options, and the time available to reach a decision. This article reviews the relationship between time
and decision making in humans with respect to this evaluation process. Moreover, the role of psychological
time, as compared with physical time, is accentuated. Five topics have been selected that illustrate how time and
mental representations of time affect decision making. These are (1) the duration of options, (2) temporal decision making, (3) the time between having made a decision and experiencing the consequences of that decision,
(4) the temporal perspective of decision makers, and (5) the duration of the decision process. The discussion
of each topic is supplemented by suggestions for further research. It is shown that psychological time is often

This article was written to highlight the role that time
and mental representations of time play in decision making. Making decisions usually requires evaluating at least
two alternatives that differ on a number of attributes (Reed,
2004). When alternatives are evaluated, three aspects of
duration matter. First, the alternatives from which a person
is forced to choose the “right” one differ, among other
things, regarding their duration. It is easy to imagine that
the alternatives’ durations might have a large impact on a
decision if, for example, one has to decide between two
aversive events (let’s say, two dental treatments including
drilling) that differ only on the duration dimension. In this
case, we would expect that short events will be preferred
over long events.
Second, part of the evaluation of alternatives consists
of anticipating the expected time of their realization. The
effect of the delay between the commitment to an option
and the occurrence of a consequence has stimulated a
broad range of research on so-called intertemporall decision making. Anticipating delays in realizing an option
not only reduces the value of that option, but also alters its
mental representation. For example, consequences occurring in the far future are represented with less detail than
are consequences occurring in the near future.
Third, the time available for making choices definitely
has an impact on both the amount of information that is
processed and the quality of the final decision, particularly when the duration of the decision process is limited
by external factors.
In order to make a beneficial decision, a decision maker
has to correctly gauge the durations of the options, the durations of the expected delays in realizing the options, and
the time available to reach a decision. In 2001, an article
written by Ariely and Zakay was published that reviewed

some issues relating time and decision making from a
rather general perspective. When making suggestions forr
future research, they referred to the importance of perceived time, as compared with physical time, in decision
making. Since publication of the Ariely and Zakay article,
new data have been reported that, in fact, stress the role
that psychological time plays in the making of decisions.
Therefore, the present article focuses on effects on decision making that have been suggested to be dependent on
the way decision makers represent time with respect to
both the options and the decision process itself.
In situations in which people are forced to make decisions, particularly those realized in experimental conditions, psychological time is either imagined time orr
experienced time. Experienced time might lead people
to choose one option over another, if both are evaluatedd
retrospectively and are different in duration. Experiencedd
time is affected by the amount of attention that is allocatedd
to the processing of time,1 if people are aware that timing
is relevant, or by the number of contextual changes that
occur during a time period, if people do not know or suspect that they will be asked to judge duration until afterr
the time period has ended (Block, 2003; Block & Zakay,
1997).
Imagined time refers to either the time at which an outcome is expected to occur or the amount of time for which
an outcome will last. There is evidence that imagined duration relies, at least partially, on duration experiencedd
in the past (Roy, Christenfeld, & McKenzie, 2005), and,
therefore, quantitative modeling of imagined time shouldd
be possible (see, e.g., Eisler, Eisler, & Montgomery, 2004,
who modeled retrospective time judgments using a psychophysics approach). This means that choosing between
outcomes that differ in duration or choosing between out-

comes that differ in delay for realization might involve
relying on a kind of numerical representation of that particular time. Taking this assumption for granted, one may
argue that choosing one alternative over the other is at
least partly dependent on how durations pertaining to the
decision problem are mentally represented. In particular,
one may ask whether or not decisions might be affected if
the pertinent durations are in some way misrepresented.
There is ample evidence that representations of duration are biased regarding their means and their variability.
Mean judgments of long durations are often shorter than
their corresponding physical durations, whereas short durations tend to be judged as longer than they really are, a
result that commonly is described as Vierordt’s law (e.g.,
Predebon, 1995; Szelag, Kowalska, Rymarczyk, & Pöppel, 2002; Wearden, 2003). Concerning the variability of
temporal judgments, an estimate of duration, like estimates
of most other magnitudes, will become more variable (i.e.,
will deviate more from its mean), the longer the duration
to be estimated is (e.g., Allan, 1998; Klapproth, 2007;
Wearden, 2003). This finding is a form of Weber’s law.
If duration matters in decision making and if the effect
of duration on decisions is due to the ability of an individual to judge time with precision, the timely aspects of
decision making should be considered more thoroughly.
For example, how is duration taken into account (and by
which mechanisms) when duration of options is considered? Does an internal clock trigger the time of decision
making under time pressure? How is time discounting related to time estimation? Does the anticipation of delays
in intertemporal choices depend on the individual’s time
perspective?
To address these questions, I attempted in this review to
accentuate the relationship between decision making and
both aspects of time—the physical as well as the psychological aspect. Recent studies have revealed that internal
timing mechanisms might support people in making fast
decisions (Macar & Vidal, 2003, 2004; MacDonald &
Meck, 2004; Praamstra, Kourtis, Kwok, & Oostenveld,
2006), that brain activity during delay discounting has
some resemblance to neural activation during time estimation (Wittmann, Leland, & Paulus, 2007), and that the
representation of time itself may influence intertemporal
choices (Berns, Laibson, & Loewenstein, 2007; Takahashi, Oono, & Radford, 2008).
Time matters within the decision-making process at
least regarding the evaluation of alternatives and with respect to the process itself. Concerning these aspects of
decision making, I have subdivided this article into five
sections. Selection of these sections was further motivated
by the fact that recent findings regarding relationships between psychological time and decision making have been
made primarily with respect to these topics.
The first section will deal with the durations of the alternatives about which a person has to decide and how the
alternatives’ durations influence the choice in favor of one
alternative. The second section will consider a special case
of the first section. It will illustrate choices for which duration is the only relevant attribute of the options, a form
of decision making that is documented in the literature as

temporal decision making. The third section will be about
choosing between delayed outcomes, usually called interr
temporal choices. It comprises four subsections that will
present (1) the description of a classical model of temporal discounting, (2) differences between exponential and
hyperbolic delay discounting, (3) the relationship between
delay discounting and time perception, and (4) the connection between delay discounting and the mental representation of the future. In intertemporal choices, decision
makers have to anticipate delays that separate the decision
from its consequences. The fourth section will relate decision making to the traits of an individual that account
for his or her future time perspective—that is, how he or
she anticipates personal future goals and actions. As compared with the paradigm for intertemporal choices, this
section will provide alternative views on how future outcomes are valued. The fifth and last section will consider
the duration of the decision process, which has often been
reported to influence the decision outcome. This section
will be subdivided into two parts, one referring to decision
making under limited time resources, the other presenting literature with respect to choice reaction time tasks.
Making decisions under time pressure might require that
decision makers engage in estimating the time available
for the decision.
At the end of each section, the main findings will be
summarized, conclusions will be offered, and questions or
suggestions for future research will be presented.

Duration of Options
This section reviews literature bearing on the impact
that the durations of alternatives has on choosing between
those alternatives.
Review of the Literature
On the basis of the fact that decision makers usually
resort to nontemporal features of an experience (such as
slope, end, and peak) when evaluating it, Kahneman and
co-authors (e.g., Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber, &
Redelmeier, 1993; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996) suggested that people ignore or severely underweight the
duration of consequences, which they called duration neglect. They found in several studies that evaluation of experiences was based primarily on the intensities of the experiences, rather than on the durations of the experiences.
For example, Varey and Kahneman (1992) presented subjects with hypothetical experiences that differed in duration and in intensity over time and asked them to provide
a global evaluation of each experience on a 0–100 scale.
They found that ratings of these experiences were based
on the maximum and final intensities of the experiences,
with little weight on duration. Fredrickson and Kahneman
(1993) focused on the role of duration in overall retrospective ratings of affective episodes. In one experiment, the
authors showed subjects long and short movie clips that
were either pleasant or unpleasant and asked them to provide a global rating of the pleasantness of the experience.

<-----Page 2----->TIME AND DECISION MAKING
ING IN HUMANS
They found that duration had little impact on these overall
evaluations. Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) conducted
a study with patients who underwent colonoscopy or lithotripsy. The patients were then asked to report the total pain
they had experienced, on a 10-point scale. The treatments
in their study varied in the amount of time they took. Nevertheless, the results showed no significant correlation between the duration of the procedure and its retrospective
evaluation. Hands and Avons (2001) conducted a series of
experiments in which participants were asked to evaluate
television sequences that were affected by transient picture impairments. Rating of the quality of the television
sequences was dependent mainly on the peak impairment
intensity, but the duration of an impairment was found to
have little impact on quality ratings.
However, other studies have obtained less support for
duration neglect, at least with aversive stimuli. For instance, Schreiber and Kahneman (2000) found that longer
unpleasant sounds were evaluated as worse than shorter
sounds. Another factor that seems to attenuate duration
neglect is the focus of the subjects’ attention. Rinot and
Zakay (1999) let some subjects evaluate the overall annoyance they experienced from each sound in a series of
annoying sounds and let others evaluate both the overall annoyance and the duration of each experience. The
overall evaluations in the latter condition were more sensitive to duration than were those in the former condition.
Read and Loewenstein (1999) investigated their subjects’
willingness to experience different durations of pain in
exchange for payment. They revealed that willingness to
accept (WTA) pain depended strongly on the duration of
the pain and that this relationship was clearly nonlinear—
that is, the increase of WTA was larger at short durations
than at long durations.
There is mixed evidence that duration plays a role when
people select among alternative courses of action in order to
save time. Time-saving decisions are characterized mainly
by the attempt to choose options that have the shortest
duration—for example, when deciding whether to drive to
the university by car (which will take about 30 min) or to
take the bus (which will last 15 min longer). However, the
decision for a certain amount of time loss is confounded
with the probability with which the time loss is expected
to occur. In a series of studies, Leclerc, Schmitt, and Dubé
(1995) presented their subjects with various scenarios that
involved a selection between two alternatives carrying an
identical expected loss of time. In each scenario, subjects
were required to choose between a certain time loss and
a variable time loss (e.g., having to wait 60 min for sure,
or a 50% chance of waiting 30 min and a 50% chance of
waiting 90 min). In most cases, the subjects selected the
certain loss rather than the variable loss, hence ignoring
the durations of the options. Krishnamurthy and Kumar
(2002) could furthermore show that risk aversion to waiting time was stronger when people imagined themselves
as being confronted with a scenario than when they imagined other people making the choice.
Indeed, evaluation of waiting time has been shown to
be better when people are informed about the expected
length of the wait than when no information is provided

511

regarding the wait duration, independently of the actual
duration of the wait (Dellaert & Kahn, 1999; Hui & Tse,
1996; Hui & Zhou, 1996). Thus, a wait appears to be less
aversive the more predictable its duration is.
A different pattern of results, however, has been found
when decisions are made from experience. Whereas
scenario-based studies of time-saving decisions tend to
reflect risk aversion (Krishnamurthy & Kumar, 2002;
Leclerc et al., 1995), Munichor, Erev, and Lotem (2006)
found that time-saving decisions reflected a tendency to
prefer options that led to the best outcomes (i.e., the shortest durations) when decision makers had to rely on personal experiences.
Ariely and Loewenstein (2000) examined the impact
of different evaluation methods on the role of duration
in evaluations. They used a range of procedures, such as
ratings, willingness to pay, and a graded-choice procedure in which subjects repeatedly chose between annoying
sounds. Comparing these evaluation methods, they found
that the rating procedures commonly used in previous research elicited the least sensitivity to duration. However,
decisions or comparative ratings corresponded with an
increased weight that people placed on duration.
Summary, Conclusion, and
Suggestions for Future Research
The majority of experiments being reviewed have shown
that the durations of options played only a negligible role in
decision making. However, there are some cases in which
duration seems to be considered for judgment: (1) when
choices have to be made between aversive stimuli; (2) when
decision makers pay attention to the durations of the options; (3) when durations are certain, rather than uncertain;
(4) when durations are experienced, rather than imagined
as part of a scenario; and (5) when people choose between
options, rather then evaluating them.
Ariely and Loewenstein (2000) picked up the latter point
and argued that the role of duration should be considered
separately in two aspects of behavior: encoding and making choices. They suggested that when the goodness and
badness of experiences are encoded, ignoring duration is
not necessarily a mistake and can even be desirable. The
idea here is that, in many cases, overall evaluations are
used to classify events into classes of desirable and nondesirable objects, and their duration is often a separate
factor that can be considered later (at the choice stage). In
the case of making choices, however, the role of duration
should be very different. When choosing, it would be a
mistake not to take duration into account, since this could
cause a wrong allocation of time to different activities.
Why duration sometimes matters and sometimes does
not has not been clarified yet. Presumably, encoding of
duration is impaired when duration is of minor importance
for the decision maker or when attention is distracted from
duration. It is well known from timing experiments that
timing becomes less accurate when attention is devoted
mainly to nontemporal information processing (e.g.,
Brown, 1997).
A possible attempt to examine more directly whether and
how duration matters in choice is to systematically vary

stimulus duration while keeping any other stimulus attribute constant. Suppose that there are two options: Option A
is a very unpleasant event, and Option B is a less unpleasant
(yet not pleasant) event. Holding the duration of Option A
constant while varying the duration values of Option B
would yield a particular duration of B at which the preference for Option A equals the preference for Option B. For
example, a 10-sec surge with high intensity might correspond to a 60-sec surge with low intensity. In this example,
the high-intensity surge equals in preference a low-intensity
surge with a duration six times higher than that of the highintensity surge. However, selecting durations for Option A
other than the one used in this example would yield other
values of duration that belong to Option B.
Figure 1 illustrates the subjective equivalence between
both option durations. Assuming that there would be a linear relationship, Option A would be chosen with the same
frequency as Option B multiplied by a constant factor.2
However, nonlinear relationships are also conceivable (as
is indicated in the figure). Deviations from linearity would
imply that the duration of options is not a constant weighting factor of intensity when preferences are made.
Temporal Decision Making
Temporal decision making is treated here as a special
case of choices made between alternatives differing in
duration.
Review of the Literature
When people choose between options of different duration, the best alternative is usually one that is evaluated
as being most pleasant or as having the highest utility.
However, decisions are conceivable where people do not
care about the pleasantness or the utility of experiences
but focus on duration as the only relevant attribute of an
experience. For example, an individual must decide when
to switch off the oven in order to prevent the cookies from
baking too long and getting burnt. Essentially, and provided that no external clock aids the process of time keeping, he or she must estimate the passage of time to come
to an appropriate decision.

What makes a decision a temporal decision? To answer
this question, I will present a very simple example of a time
estimation task that is frequently used in time research laboratories, called temporal generalization (see, e.g., Klapproth, 2002; Wearden, 1992; Wearden, Denovan, Fakhri, &
Haworth, 1997). In this task, a person is initially exposed to
a standard duration (e.g., a tone of 400 msec duration). After
a few exposures to the standard, comparison durations are
presented that are longer than, shorter than, or equal to the
standard duration. The subject has to judge whether each
of the comparisons is the standard or not, simply by giving
a yes or a no response (usually via a keypress). In most of
the studies reported in the literature, feedback as to performance accuracy is given to the subjects.
What does the subject have to do when judging the duration of the stimulus? First, he or she has to encode the
duration of the standard being presented at the beginning.
This might be done by an internal device that operates in
a way similar to an oscillating neuron that emits pulses
with regular frequency. Then the standard duration must
be stored into memory for the purpose of later comparisons. The comparison durations presented as test stimuli
likewise need to be encoded, and, finally, both the internal
representation of the standard and the internal representation of the comparison have to be checked regarding their
equality. Even if the comparison and standard durations
were physically the same, it seems unlikely (due to noise
in information processing) that they will be exactly subjectively equal. Therefore, the subject needs a criterion
that allows him or her to decide whether the two durations
are subjectively close enough to elicit a yes response.
Even this simple task involves at least three mental operations: the encoding of stimulus duration, memorization
of stimulus duration, and a decision process that is needed
to generate the similarity decision.
Gibbon, Church, and Meck (1984), who conducted
temporal generalization experiments with rats, proposed
an information-processing model of temporal discrimination, the scalar timing theory. The scalar timing theory
was initially developed to explain regularities in the timing behavior of rats and pigeons (Church & DeLuty, 1977;
Church & Gibbon, 1982) and was then extended to human
timing performance (Wearden & McShane, 1988). The
key assumptions of this theory are (1) that estimates of
real duration are, on average, accurate and (2) that standard deviations of time estimations grow proportionally
with the mean of time estimations. The latter relationship
is a form of Weber’s law. Scalar timing theory assumes
three levels for the processing of temporal information
(see Figure 2). The highest level is the clock level, consisting of a pacemaker–accumulator device. The pacemaker
generates pulses that are recorded and added by an accumulator. The content of the accumulator is then transferred
into memory (the next level). Finally, there is a decision
level, at which the comparison is made between a sample
of the standard drawn from memory and the duration of
a comparison stimulus represented in the accumulator.
(Note that some authors distinguish between working
memory and the accumulator. For the sake of simplicity,
both instances are treated here as being identical.)

Decision processes seem to be an essential part of the
timing system, and different decision processes have been
proposed for different sorts of timing tasks, but most variants of timing tasks seem to encourage a form of decision
making that is called the thresholded normalized difference
modell (Wearden, 2004). This means that judgments of the
similarity or identity of durations appear to be done by calculating the absolute difference between a to-be-judged
duration (comparison) and some kind of standard duration and then normalizing this difference by some quantity
(e.g., the standard or the comparison duration). This result
is then compared with a certain threshold value.
Modeling temporal generalization easily illustrates how
hypothetical decision processes with respect to stimulus duration might work in humans. A temporal generalization task begins with a number of presentations of
the standard, s, which is assumed to reside in memory.
The memory is assumed to be represented as a Gaussian
distribution with an accurate mean and some coefficient
of variation (standard deviation/mean). On each trial, a
random sample, s*, is drawn from memory of s, and the
subject identifies a comparison duration, t, as the standard
if abs(s*  t)/t  b*, where s* is a sample from the standard represented in memory, t is the representation of the
comparison duration, and b* is a threshold variable from
trial to trial with a constant mean.3
Among the various manipulations that have led to
changes in timing performances of humans, only a small
number of factors that might affect decision processes
alone have been reported. These are (1) task difficulty,
(2) the payoff structure, and (3) time pressure.

Ferrara, Lejeune, and Wearden (1997) let two groups
conduct a temporal generalization task and varied the
spacing of comparison durations between them. One group
received comparison durations spaced in 150-msec steps
(the easy group), whereas the other group had comparison
durations spaced in 75-msec steps (the difficultt group).
Ferrara et al. found that discrimination between the comparisons and the standard was better in the group with the
75-msec spacing. This result was replicated by Wearden
and Grindrod (2003), who again found apparently greater
timing sensitivity when discrimination was more difficult.
Ferrara et al., as well as Wearden and Grindrod, offered
a possible explanation by assuming a lower value of the
threshold b (i.e., a stricter threshold) in the difficult condition, as compared with the easy condition.
In the same study, Wearden and Grindrod (2003) manipulated the temporal decision process by encouraging
or discouraging people to make yes responses in a temporal generalization task by awarding or deducting points.
Encouraging identifications of the standard increased the
proportion of identifications of the standard, whereas the
discouraging manipulation decreased identifications of
the standard. Modeling showed that the main theoretical
difference between the two conditions was due to a change
in the decision threshold.
In a recent article, Klapproth and Müller (2008) used
response times to detect not only which temporal decisions
were made, but also when they were made. They required
subjects within a temporal generalization task to make time
judgments either normally, taking as much time as they
wanted, or as quickly as possible, regardless of whether all
the stimuli judged had actually been terminated. Performance was different in the two conditions, and strong evidence was found from reaction time measures that people
could make timing decisions before the stimuli had finished. This result indicated how much temporal information was needed to make temporal decisions.
Summary, Conclusion, and
Suggestions for Future Research
Decision processes play an essential role in timing, as is
suggested by one of the most prominent theories of temporal processing, the scalar timing theory, and its modifications. Decision processes in timing can be modeled
by assuming that perceived differences of durations are
normalized and then compared with a decision threshold.
Decision processes are subject to manipulation by varying
(1) task difficulty, (2) the payoff structure of the task, and
(3) the time available for the decision. Whereas manipulating task difficulty will lead to changes in the variance
of time estimations, variations of both the payoff structure and time pressure will change the mean of temporal
judgments.
To conclude, the effects of manipulating the decision
process in temporal decision making are compatible with
assumptions derived from scalar timing theory.
Much work has been done to model decision processes
in timing tasks, such as temporal generalization and temporal bisection. However, tasks remain that are still little
understood in terms of the mental processes underlying

<-----Page 5----->514

these tasks: for example, the production and reproduction of temporal intervals, as well as verbal estimations of
experienced periods of duration. Future research should
investigate to what extent existing models of temporal decision making can explain timing behavior elicited by the
latter tasks. Some first steps have been taken: Wearden
(2003), for instance, applied principles of scalar timing
theory to the method of temporal reproduction; in another
article (Wearden, 2004), the process of verbal estimation
was analyzed in some detail.
Moreover, the time course of temporal decision making
should be looked at more thoroughly, since it might give
more insight into what is actually processed in temporal
processing. Analyzing real-time processes in temporal decision making by using quantitative decision models has
been discussed by Klapproth (2003b) and Klapproth and
Müller (2008).
Time Between Decisions and Consequences
Anticipating delays that separate a decision from its
consequences has been reported to have a large impact on
the outcome of a decision. The next section will review the
literature pertaining to this issue.

small reward varies across trials from near zero to equal
to that of the large reward. If the small reward values are
presented in ascending order, initially, the large reward is
likely to be preferred (e.g., €1,000 in 1 year instead of €1
now). As the small reward grows larger (e.g., €1,000 in
1 year as opposed to €990 now), preference shifts to the
small reward. The value of the small reward at which the
preference switches defines the current subjective value
of the large reward or, in other words, the amount of discounting of the large reward due to delay. A discounting
function can be derived for any individual subject when
subjective values have been estimated for the same large
reward at several delays. This discounting function shows
the extent to which subjective value changes under delay.
Usually, discounting functions are decelerating—that is,
the more temporally distant an expected consequence, the
weaker its impact on current behavior.
A central assumption of the DU model is that intertemporal choice can be expressed by a single parameter, the
discount rate (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue,
2002). In its original form, the DU model assumed a constant discount rate. The intertemporal utility function in the
DU model can be described by the following equation:
T t

Review of the Literature
The discounted utility model. The time span between
the instant when a decision is made and the realization of
its outcomes is an important factor that alters the decisionmaking process substantially. An immediate reward is, on
average, more attractive than the same reward paid out
after some weeks have elapsed. This phenomenon, known
as temporal discounting, was first described by the discounted utility (DU) modell (Samuelson, 1937), according
to which the utility of a consequence exponentially decreases as the delay for the consequence increases.
Experimental research on temporal discounting involves both real consequences and delays, as well as
hypothetical choice scenarios. Since the latter allow the
study of a much broader range of delays, they have usually been preferred by researchers. In many studies, the
consequences under consideration are amounts of money.
Data typically are collected individually, with the goal of
depicting each individual’s tendency to discount delayed
outcomes by means of an empirical discounting function.
On each trial, subjects choose between a small reward that
is available immediately (or in the near future; see, e.g.,
Green, Myerson, & Macaux, 2005) and a large reward
that is available in the far future. Across many trials, the
delay for the large reward and the amount of the small
reward are varied. The goal is to identify the current subjective value of outcomes of various delays, with subjective value defined as the magnitude of the small reward
that generates indifference in a choice against the large
reward. This subjective value suggests the extent to which
a large reward has been discounted because of delay. An
example might illustrate the experimental procedure typically applied. In one experimental condition, the amount
and delay of the large reward may remain constant (e.g.,
€1,000 to be given in 1 year), whereas the amount of the

k  [1/(1  ¼)]k.
In this equation, u(ct  kk) is the utility function (expressing the utility of a reward c at the instance t  k),
k T is
the time horizon, and D(k)
k is the individual discount function (expressing the relative weight of a reward at t  k, as
compared with its weight at t); ¼ represents the discount
rate—that is, the amount by which a future reward is discounted, as compared with an immediate reward.
Exponential versus hyperbolic discounting. Constant discount rates imply exponential discounting. However, the most commonly described discounting behavior is hyperbolic, which means that delayed rewards are
discounted by functions that are inversely proportional to
delay (e.g., Glimcher, Kable, & Louie, 2007; Green & Myerson, 1996; Jones & Rachlin, 2006; Myerson & Green,
1995; Rohde, 2005). Hyperbolic discount functions decay
at a more rapid rate for short time periods than for long
time periods, which means that a hyperbolic discounter is
more impatient when short-run trade-offs are made than
when trade-offs for the long run are made (Berns et al.,
2007). Hyperbolic discounting is also consistent with the
finding that humans can change their preferences between
two delayed rewards in favor of the more proximate reward
as the time to both rewards decreases (Green, Fristoe, &
Myerson, 1994; Kirby & Herrnstein, 1995).
Although human delay discounting, for the most part, is
best explained by a hyperbolic discounting function, there
is some evidence that humans can be less impulsive than
is predicted by hyperbolic discounting and can behave in a
more rational manner. Forzano and Logue (1992) showed
that subjects are more impulsive in conditions when, after
each choice, juice is given during the experiment, as compared with conditions in which subjects are provided with

<-----Page 6----->TIME AND DECISION MAKING
ING IN HUMANS
money or points exchangeable for juice at the end of the
experiment. Loewenstein (1996) found that visceral factors,
such as hunger, thirst, and sexual desire, might increase impulsivity but that controlling for these factors will result in
less impulsive behavior. Montague and Berns (2002) proposed that uncertainty in decision situations will encourage a steeper (i.e., hyperbolic) discounting than will occur
when there is no uncertainty, the latter condition leading,
rather, to exponential discounting. Recently, Schweighofer
et al. (2006) let subjects conduct a delay-discounting task
in which the time to gain maximal reward was limited and
delays were experienced rather than imagined. They found
that their subjects adopted exponential discounting, which,
in effect, maximized reward at the end of the experiment.
Delay discounting and time perception. Recently,
Takahashi et al. (2008) suggested that human intertemporal choice is strongly influenced by the psychophysics
of time perception. They proposed that time perception
follows the Weber–Fechner law (i.e., assuming a logarithmic relationship between subjective and objective time)
and tried to combine the psychophysics of time perception with the classical DU model (exponential discounting). This was done by replacing the physical duration of
delay in the DU model by the subjective delay, expressed
as É  a ln (1  bD), where É is the subjective delay, D is
the physical delay, and a and b are free parameters. Takahashi and co-workers could show that the behavioral data
yielded by a delay-discounting task were fit best by the
Weber–Fechner discounting function, as compared with
hyperbolic discounting and exponential discounting.
The assumption that temporal discounting is related to
time perception has also been confirmed by studies with
subjects who showed both impulsivity in delay discounting
and impairments in time estimations. For example, drug
addicts are supposed to be more impulsive than nonaddicts
(Fillmore & Rush, 2002; Leland & Paulus, 2005). They
show less self-control in decision-making tasks, since they
discount future rewards more strongly than do control subjects; that is, they tend to prefer smaller and sooner over
larger but later rewards (Hoffman et al., 2006; Kirby &
Petry, 2004). Stimulus-dependent subjects also show impairments in time perception and sensorimotor timing
(e.g., Sayette, Loewenstein, Kirchner, & Travis, 2005). In
a study conducted recently by Wittmann, Leland, Churan,
and Paulus (2007), drug addicts and nonaddicts were compared regarding their ability to estimate time and to tap in
synchrony with a regular tone sequence. They found that
drug addicts needed larger time differences for effective duration discrimination than did control subjects, particularly
for intervals around 1 sec. Moreover, drug addicts accelerated finger tapping when the tone sequence was removed
and they still had to tap with the same rhythm. In addition,
drug addicts overestimated long intervals. The authors
concluded that the differences in time processing could be
attributed to the larger impulsivity of addicts, as compared
with nonaddicts, and that these differences might explain
why addicts have difficulty in delaying gratification.
Similar results were obtained with patients who suff
fered from damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).
These patients have generally been supposed to be more

515

impulsive than controls, and it could be shown that OFC
patients also overestimated time intervals verbally and underestimate time intervals by the method of time production (Berlin, Rolls, & Kischka, 2004).
Impulsivity and strong temporal discounting of delayed
rewards have also been observed in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As compared with control subjects, ADHD patients discounted
delayed monetary rewards more strongly and made larger
errors of reproduction (i.e., absolute difference from the
objective duration; Barkley, Edwards, Laneri, Fletcher, &
Metevia, 2001).
Wittmann, Leland, and Paulus (2007) found different
levels of brain activity during a delay-discounting task
when choices varied between immediate and delayed rewards and when the delays varied between less than a year
and 1 year or longer. They concluded that decisions of
whether to opt for a sooner or later reward require cognitive processing of time and that this processing corresponds to neural activation (e.g., in the striatum) that also
plays a role in time estimation.
Delay discounting and the representation of the future. The core assumption of temporal discounting is that
the value of an outcome is discounted as temporal distance
from the outcomes increases. However, Trope and Liberman (2003) showed that the effect of temporal distance
on the attractiveness of an option depends on the value associated with the option. For decisions in the near future,
practical aspects should be more heavily weighted, and for
decisions far in the future, desirability aspects should be
more important. In their construal level theory, Liberman
and Trope (1998) proposed that temporal distance systematically changes people’s mental representations of future
events and that these changes determine the value of those
events (Trope & Liberman, 2003). They distinguished
between high-level construals and low-level construals.
High-level construals involve the abstract representation
of events, basically comprising global features, whereas
low-level construals include rather peripheral, concrete,
and local features. Construal level theory suggests that
the representation of distant future events will be more
abstract, broad, and structured (high level) than the representation of near future events (low level).
Temporal distance should increase the weight of highlevel value and decrease the weight of low-level value. As
a result, temporal distance should shift the overall attractiveness of an option closer to its high-level value than to
its low-level value. Therefore, when the low-level value
of an option is more positive than its high-level value, the
option should be more attractive in the near future, which
is also proposed by time-discounting theories. However,
when the high-level value of an option is more positive,
the option should be more attractive in the distant future.
For example, temporal distance should increase the preference for gambles with a low probability of winning a
large prize but decrease the preference for gambles with
a high probability of winning a small prize (Sagristano,
Trope, & Liberman, 2002).
Moreover, many decisions are seen in a different light as
the time approaches to put them into practice, since people

<-----Page 7----->516

KLAPPROTH

place greater weight on concrete and practical considerations, relative to more vague and abstract dimensions,
for desirability. For instance, people may revise a decision
already made when the moment to implement it arrives
(for an overview, see Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch,
2001). In a study of Welch (1999), for example, students
were offered a payment of $1 in exchange for telling a joke
in front of a class the following week. When the appointment came closer, both the students who had agreed to tell
the joke and those who had declined to do so were given
the opportunity to change their minds. It was shown that
67% of those who initially volunteered decided not to tell
the joke, whereas none of those who had initially declined
the offer changed their minds and decided to tell the joke
at the last minute.
There is evidence showing that events occurring at relatively closer temporal proximities are processed differently
than events occurring in more distant proximities (Sanna
& Chang, 2006). When events are presented as occurring
at more distant temporal proximities, individuals are more
susceptible to fallacies (Sanna, Parks, Chang, & Carter,
2005), valenced information (Liberman, Sagristano, &
Trope, 2002), and optimistic bias (Gilovich, Kerr, & Medvec, 1993), relative to when events are occurring at close
temporal proximity. McElroy and Mascari (2007) investigated how temporal proximity of options influences decision task processing and, in turn, the likelihood of framing
effects.4 They proposed that events occurring at more distal temporal points will be perceived as less relevant than
events occurring at more proximal points. Hence, events
occurring in close temporal proximity should also be processed using a more effortful, analytic processing style.
Under these conditions, decision makers should rely on
the numeric magnitude of the alternatives, rather than on
the presentational frame. However, if the individuals perceive the event as occurring in relatively distant temporal
proximity, they should perceive the event as less relevant
and should be more likely to use the less effortful, holistic processing style, resulting in more robust framing
effects. McElroy and Mascari confirmed their hypotheses
by manipulating both the temporal proximity of alternative options and the framing of options as either gains or
losses. Framing effects were more attenuated if the event
was expected to occur in relatively close proximity than if
it was expected to occur at a distant point of time.
Read, Frederick, Orsel, and Rahman (2005) found that
discount rates were markedly lower when delays were
described as calendar dates (e.g., on October 17) than
when they are described in terms of time intervals (e.g.,
in 6 months). This date/delay effect might be attributed
to the way time is represented in either condition. Read
et al. presented some explanations for the results they obtained, which refer to the mental representation of time.
For example, they assumed that the date framing might
have caused the temporal interval to be underestimated,
since the subjects presumably did not realize the “real”
temporal distance between two successive dates. Although
there are certainly other accounts that might explain the
results as well without particularly considering time representation, it has become clear that thinking about the

future strikingly depends on the description of temporal
intervals. Thus, the framing within which temporal intervals are described might lead to different representations
of time and, hence, to different temporal judgments.
Indeed, there is good reason to assume that there are
multiple ways of representing time. Friedman (1990),
for example, distinguishes between (1) spatial images of
temporal intervals (e.g., the distance between June and
September represented as the spatial distance between two
numerals lying on a ruler), (2) verbal coding of temporal
order (e.g., representing the order of months as a chain of
names), and (3) the meaning of time (e.g., July might be
associated with hott and beach).
Summary, Conclusion, and
Suggestions for Future Research
Preferring outcomes that occur now, as compared with
outcomes that will occur in the future, has been explained
by models that assume that the value of future events is
discounted. Quantitative models exist that relate the discounted outcome to the delay of its realization. Psychological motives that could account for delay discounting
are, among others, visceral influences, uncertainty about
future outcomes, and impulsivity. However, the myopia
for the future may also be a product of the way the future
is mentally represented. Representing future events more
abstractly than temporally nearer events might lower the
value of future events. Thinking in dates, rather than in
intervals, might lead to underestimations of the delays.
Reduced abilities to correctly estimate time intervals
might cause people to discount the future more than they
do when they succeed in time estimation.
Apparently, there is a lack of a global account that incorporates the different effects of subjective time on discounting the future. Presumably, this might be the case because
subjective time is a heterogeneous construct, ranging from
the quantitative representation of intervals between milliseconds and minutes to the qualitative and meaningful concept of time (see, e.g., Klapproth, 2003a; Pöppel, 1998).
Thus, it seems necessary to examine more closely how
subjective time affects temporal discounting. One promising possibility might lie in investigating the connection
between time estimates and discount rates experimentally.
Another approach involves the assessment of the time perspective of individuals and relating this time perspective
to the selection of options in classical decision tasks. The
next section will deal with this issue.
Decision Making and the
Future Temporal Perspective
As compared with the paradigm for intertemporal
choices, this section will provide alternative views on how
future outcomes are regarded.
Review of the Literature
Delay discounting means that rewards that will be delivered in the far future will be devalued more than rewards that will be delivered in the near future. This effect,
commonly obtained when using a delay-discounting task,
might be traced back to at least two possible reasons. First,

<-----Page 8----->TIME AND DECISION MAKING
ING IN HUMANS
the delay might be perceived by decision makers as a barrier leading to psychological or monetary costs (see, e.g.,
Leclerc et al., 1995; Osuna, 1985) that will exceed the
benefits of the potential outcomes. Second, decision makers who strongly devalue future outcomes might be more
myopic regarding the future than are decision makers who
do not or just mildly devalue future outcomes. According to this argument, people who are not able to regard
the far future will also disregard consequences that might
occur in the far future. Therefore, due to their myopia with
respect to events that might happen in the distant future,
they prefer to choose consequences that will appear immediately or at least in the proximal future (e.g., Hodgins
& Engel, 2002; Lilienfeld, Hess, & Rowland, 1996). This
second argument suggests that people who have a strong
propensity for delay discounting might also suffer from a
short temporal perspective on the future.
Future temporal perspective is commonly defined as
the present anticipation of future goals (Simons, Vansteenkiste, Lens, & Lacante, 2004). People with a rather
short future temporal perspective set most of their goals
in the near future, whereas people with a rather long or
deep temporal perspective are striving toward goals that
are situated in the more distant future. It has been found
with several investigations that the anticipated value of a
future goal decreases the more the future goal is delayed
in time (e.g., Ainslie, 1992; Rachlin, 1995). Since psychological distance toward goals in the distant future is
shorter for people with a long future temporal perspective
than for those with a short future temporal perspective,
the decrease in anticipated value as a function of temporal
delay is less steep for them (Simons et al., 2004).
There have been several attempts, reported in the literature, to assess the time perspective of individuals. Some
researchers conceive time perspective as a personal trait
(e.g., Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, & Edwards, 1994;
Zaleski, 1996). These authors developed questionnaires
whose aim was to measure the extent to which an individual’s behavior is guided by future events. A comprehensive measure that captures all three dimensions of temporal perspective (past, present, and future) is the Zimbardo
Time Perspective Inventory (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999).
This questionnaire comprises five factors (past–positive,
past–negative, present–hedonistic, present–fatalistic, and
future orientation), of which only the present and the future perspective factors serve as predictors of immediate,
pleasure-oriented goals versus long-term goals (Henson,
Carey, Carey, & Maisto, 2006). Others have sought primarily to assess the extension of the time horizon. Extension has been examined, for example, by the length of
time (in years) between the participant’s actual age and
the age at which the most distant event would occur (e.g.,
Greene, 1986; Lessing, 1972; Wallace, 1956).
Wilson and Herrnstein (1985) already associated the
behavioral measure of time discounting with the construct
of temporal perspective (here, the time horizon). They assumed that individuals who discount time at rapid rates
also have a short future time horizon. Shortened time horizons have been demonstrated in persons with substance
addictions as well and are hypothesized to provide an ex-

517

planation for the persistence of substance use by addicted
persons despite the clear risk of negative consequences
(Petry, Bickel, & Arnett, 1998; Smart, 1968; Wills, Sandy,
& Yaeger, 2001). For example, Petry et al. (1998) examined time orientation in heroin addicts and demonstrated
that addicts were less future oriented than matched control subjects without addiction problems. Heroin addicts
were also likely to choose small, immediate rewards over
large, delayed ones in a card game. Similar findings were
reported with social drinkers (Smart, 1968). Hodgins and
Engel (2002) examined whether pathological gambling
was associated with shortened time horizons by administering the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and the
Future Time Perspective Inventory (Wallace, 1956) to a
group of pathological gamblers, a group of psychiatric
day patients, and a group of social gamblers. They found
significantly shorter time horizons in pathological versus social gamblers but only small differences between
pathological gamblers and psychiatric patients, which indicated that shortened time horizons were not restricted to
addicted people.
Time perspective seems to correlate with many aspects
of everyday behavior. In general, people with a high degree of future orientation exhibit more thoughtful behavior, whereas people with a rather low degree of future
orientation tend to engage in more risky and unhealthy behaviors (Zimbardo, Keough, & Boyd, 1997). People who
give more consideration to the consequences of future
events reported fewer behaviors that would have negative
long-term effects on their health, such as drinking alcohol
and smoking, than did those who were less aware of the
future (Keough, Zimbardo, & Boyd, 1999).
Despite all the results mentioned above, until now, little
research has been done on the question of whether there
is a direct relationship between the discounting of future
rewards and the way individuals mentally represent their
own future. It might be hypothesized that people having
a strong propensity for delay discounting should also
have a less extended time horizon or should score lower
on a future time perspective scale than will people with a
rather weak propensity for delay discounting. To examine this question, Fellows and Farah (2005) investigated
the effects of dorsolateral frontal (DLF) and ventromedial
frontal (VMF) lobe damage on two aspects of temporal
foresight—namely, temporal discounting and the future
time perspective (measured by an adaptation of Wallace’s
[1956] list of future life events). The subjects were patients with DLF damage who were reported to be myopic for the future (e.g., Bechara, Dolan, & Hindes, 2002),
patients with VMF damage, patients with brain lesions
outside the frontal lobes, and normal individuals. Delay
discounting did not substantially differ among the four
groups. Moreover, subjects also did not differ regarding
the number of future events generated within the Wallace
task. However, the extension of future time perspective
(i.e., the maximum temporal distance of a future event
generated by each subject) was highest for the controls
and lowest for the VMF patients, with DLF patients and
patients with lesions outside the frontal lobes lying in between. The surprising fact that VMF damage did not in-

<-----Page 9----->518

fluence temporal discounting rates but did affect personal
future time perspective let the authors speculate that the
discounting task was presumably less sensitive than the
future time perspective task.
Summary, Conclusion, and
Suggestions for Future Research
Some researchers have argued that people can be diff
ferentiated regarding their proneness and their ability to
look into the future. Different approaches exist to examine
this ability, ranging from questionnaires to listing personal
future events. Short time horizons and little future orientation have been shown to correspond to preferring immediate rewards over remote rewards. However, studies in this
area are rare, and further research is strongly needed.
In conclusion, it can be said that whether future temporal perspective is a trait or is subject to manipulation is still
an open question. Moreover, it is a matter of debate how a
present-oriented time perspective relates to impulsiveness
obtained with delay discounting tasks.
Therefore, examining the diverse interrelationships between decision making and the future time perspective
might involve correlational analyses of measures of delay
discounting—for example, the discount rate—and the
temporal perspective obtained from different measures
and in various contexts. Since temporal perspective also
depends on the specification of the anticipated aspects of
the future (Stern & Koerber, 2000), I furthermore suggest
assessing the subjects’ time perspective through the evaluation of personal events that they expect to occur in several successive years. Evaluation can be done regarding
the vividness and richness of reported events (cf. Brandtstädter & Wentura, 1994).
Moreover, since temporal perspective usually is conceived as a trait factor and, hence, might be rather unaffected by environmental stimulations, it should be examined whether temporal perspective causes an individual’s
proneness to devaluate future rewards. Causal interpretations of significant relationships between trait factors
and behavioral measures should be treated with caution.
However, dividing individuals into groups of high and low
scorers on a future time perspective scale and then providing each group with a delay-discounting task should
reveal differences between both groups regarding the discount rate, which, in turn, may have been caused by differences in the trait factor.
The Duration of the Decision Process
This section will deal with the effects of limited time on
the making of decisions.
Review of the Literature
Any decision needs time for the processing of relevant information. Some decisions are very fast and are
supposed not to be based on extensive information processing (Russo & Schoemaker, 1989). Processing more
information and changing the processing style from intuitive processing to analytic and algorithmic processing
will require more time for making a decision. The time
someone invests while he or she is making a decision is

certainly dependent on a number of features of the situation surrounding the decision—for example, on the nature
and complexity of the problem, on the subjective risk involved, on personal habits and experiences, and the like
(McGrath & Tschan, 2004).
Decision making under limited time resources.
The amount of information processed before a decision is
made certainly influences the time taken before a decision
is reached. However, there is a norm for making decisions
as soon as they can be made (McGrath & Tschan, 2004).
Thus, decision makers often adopt strategies to abbreviate information processing and the decision-making process. One well-known strategy is labeled the satisficing
heuristic (Simon, 1955). That is, people search only until
they find a solution that meets their minimal requirements
and then adopt that solution without further search. Another strategy for abbreviating the decision process is to
consider and eliminate alternatives in a sequential order
(Russo & Dosher, 1983). In this strategy, one compares
each alternative with the previously considered one, and
once an alternative has been eliminated, it is not reconsidered again. All of these heuristics certainly shorten the
time until a decision is reached.
In many real-life situations (e.g., traffic control, emergency situations), shortage of time, or the existence of an
external deadline, is a natural characteristic of the decision environment. This deadline, which limits or reduces
the time available to make an optimal decision, shall define the term time pressure, and its effects on decision
making will be reported within the following paragraphs.
High levels of time pressure can lead to perceptual narrowing and, thus, to a reduced utilization of available cues,
decreased vigilance, and reduction in working memory
capacity (Klein, 1997; Orasanu, 1997; Orasanu & Fischer,
1997; Stokes, Barnett, & Wickens, 1987). In high-tempo
event-driven environments, operators may have neither the
time nor the attentional resources that are required to examine and evaluate multiple possible hypotheses (Maule,
1997; Orasanu & Fischer, 1997; Wickens & Flach, 1988).
Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton (1981) posited that decision
makers under time pressure have a tendency to show more
rigid behavior, described as the failure to alter and adapt
behavior to a new situation. This rigidity is a consequence
of two effects of time pressure. First, information processing is altered. Less information is processed because
there is a narrowing of the field of attention, and there is
a simplification in information processing. Second, there
is a constriction in the control system. For individuals,
this manifests itself as a tendency toward dominant, welllearned, and habituated behavior, regardless of the needs
of the specific situation. Both of these effects together may
lead to a fixation of behavior (see also Betsch, Fiedler, &
Brinkmann, 1998). However, individuals who succeed in
choosing a simplifying strategy that is well adapted for a
given task perform better (Payne, Bettman, & Johnson,
1993).
Time pressure might keep decision makers from choosing the best alternative since, it has been assumed, they
divide their attention between estimating the elapsed
time and selecting an alternative (Zakay, 1993; Zakay &

<-----Page 10----->TIME AND DECISION MAKING
ING IN HUMANS
Wooler, 1984). Moreover, choice probabilities can change
if time limits are imposed (e.g., Busemeyer, 1985; Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). For instance, Goldstein and
Busemeyer (1992) studied performance in a task in which
the participants had to choose between a small but certain
loss and an unpredictable gamble that was equally likely
to produce a loss or a win. When decision time was limited
to 1 sec, the gamble was chosen more often than the certain loss. However, at longer decision times (up to 3 sec),
preferences were reversed, so that the certain loss became
the more frequent choice.
However, a decision that takes longer is not necessarily
better. Eisenhardt (1989) found that decisions of top management teams made more quickly were of higher quality than decisions that took a longer time. In her study,
fast decisions of management teams took between 1.5 and
4 months, whereas longer decisions took between 12 and
18 months. The fast decisions reflected more frequent
meetings within the company, more real-time information
being available, more experienced advisors, and a more
integrative way of dealing with disagreements and conflicts. The fast decisions apparently did not suffer from the
processes found in experimental research. On the contrary,
fast decisions were made on the basis of more information; several alternatives were elaborated simultaneously,
and these decisions were more successful.
Time pressure may enhance effort and lead to faster
processing of information (Kerstholt, 1994; Maule,
Hockey, & Bdzola, 2000; Payne et al., 1993). Although
many studies have shown that faster processing of information do sometimes correspond to less careful consideration of alternatives (Benson & Beach, 1996), time pressure could, on the other hand, encourage the application of
simplified and even more effective strategies (Staw et al.,
1981). Payne et al. found that under moderate time pressure, people accelerated their processing and tried to work
faster, but without changing their pattern of processing. As
time pressure increased, shifts in the pattern of processing were observed; for example, subjects switched from
alternative-based processing, in which they compared
two alternatives and discarded the losing one, to attributebased processing, in which they discarded any alternative
that did not fulfill the most important attribute. Because
attribute-based decision making looks at all alternatives,
but not at all dimensions of each alternative, it is generally
less time consuming.
Time pressure may not have uniform effects on all types
of decisions and under all circumstances. Kelly and Karau
(1999) showed that initial preferences and task characteristics, as well as expertise, may mediate its effects. Time
pressure affects novice and expert decision makers differently. The latter take time into account more explicitly than
novices do. Expert decision makers more often ask explicitly about how much time they have left before they must
commit to a decision. Moreover, they estimate the available
time more precisely (Cohen, Freeman, & Wolf, 1996).
Choice reaction time tasks. It has been shown that
when the decision horizon is infinite (i.e., there is no
deadline), the optimal strategy for decision making is to
accumulate sensory evidence for one alternative over the

519

other until a fixed threshold is reached. It appears that
humans (and animals) accumulate information and make
perceptual decisions in a manner close to this optimal strategy (Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes, & Cohen, 2006;
Luce, 1986; Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998). However, in most
forced choice experiments, as well as in many situations
in a natural environment, decisions must be made before
a certain deadline has approached. Rapidly responding
within a decision task might require a trade-off between
the time needed for the decision maker to make a choice
and the correctness of the choice. Several theoretical attempts deal with the nature of such speed–accuracy relations. One of the simplest conceptions of speed–accuracy
relations has been presented by Yellot (1971). This model
states that the decrement in accuracy produced by emphasizing speed is due to a failure of stimulus processing
on some proportion of trials. These responses are called
fast-guess responses, since they are initiated without any
stimulus processing. These responses are much faster than
usual responses, but they will have only a chance probability of being correct.
There exist numerous sequential-sampling models as
alternatives to simple fast guessing (see, e.g., Dror, Busemeyer, & Basola, 1999; Link, 1992; Nosofsky & Palmeri,
1997; Ratcliff & Smith, 2004). Although some authors
have proposed a deterministic accumulation process (e.g.,
Brown & Heathcote, 2005) in which the integration of
information occurs in a ballistic manner, most models are
based on the premise that the mental representation of
stimuli is inherently noisy, and to make a decision about a
stimulus, one must accumulate successive samples of this
noisy stimulus representation until a certain criterion is
obtained. The criterion determines which of two responses
is made, and the time needed to attain the criterion determines the response time. The amount of information
required for a response can be controlled by the subject,
who can adjust the decision criterion. Trade-offs between
speed and accuracy are made within these models with
respect to the amount of evidence needed for a response,
and changes of the values of the decision criteria alter the
trade-off either to faster responses or to more accurate
responses (Diederich, 2003). Time pressure will lower
the decision criteria, which in turn will lead to shorter
response times and higher error rates (e.g., Laver, 2000;
Pachella & Pew, 1968; Ruthruff, 1996).
Response time in choice tasks could be governed by
an internal pacemaker, as Laming (1979) suggested. He
claimed that people engage in premature stimulus sampling and that the onset of stimulus sampling occurs after
a certain time interval has passed after a warning signal
(or preceding reactions) in choice reaction time tasks.
Dehaene (1993) proposed that perceptual information is
transmitted by packets at regular moments in time. For
each packet, a decision is made, either to respond immediately or to wait for the next packet in order to transmit
more complete information to the response system. Several
other studies have confirmed the hypothesis that internal
timing is used to aid the speed of decision making (e.g.,
Grosjean, Rosenbaum, & Elsinger, 2001; Lupker, Brown,
& Colombo, 1997; Snodgrass, 1969). For example, Burle

<-----Page 11----->520

KLAPPROTH

and Bonnet (2000) let their subjects work on a short-term
memory-scanning task. They could show that varying the
speed of a hypothetical internal clock by means of auditory clicks altered the time to respond as to whether a justpresented stimulus belonged to the set of stimuli previously memorized. They concluded that the probability that
a response will be given is not regular in time and that there
are some particular moments after stimulus presentation
at which the response to this stimulation is more likely to
occur (Burle, Macar, & Bonnet, 2003). Other authors also
have suggested that decision time is determined not only
by the way information is accumulated and a decision is
reached, but also by timing mechanisms (MacDonald &
Meck, 2004). People decide more quickly when the decision task has a predictable, temporally regular structure.
This improvement in performance is typically attributed to
the preparation of the motor system (Grosjean et al., 2001;
Müller-Gethmann, Ulrich, & Rinkenauer, 2003), but temporal preparation may also be mediated by sensorimotor
association (Janssen & Shadlen, 2005) or sensory processes (Ghose & Maunsell, 2002). An example of a temporally structured decision task was used by Praamstra et al.
(2006). In that study, subjects had to indicate as quickly as
possible whether subsequently presented arrows pointed
to the left or to the right. The stimulus onset asynchrony
(SOA) between two stimuli was held constant but was
changed for the last stimulus, which was presented either
earlier or later than the preceding SOAs. It could be shown
that reaction times were longer when the final SOA deviated from the preceding ones. Moreover, this behavioral
finding was supported by the development of a slow preparatory brain potential between successive stimuli, the (contingent negative variation) CNV. The CNV develops when
people are engaged in time estimation (Macar & Vidal,
2003, 2004; Pfeuty, Ragot, & Pouthas, 2003; Pouthas,
Garnero, Ferrandez, & Renault, 2000), and its latency and
amplitude correlate with the duration to be judged. In the
Praamstra et al. study, the CNV reached its peak amplitude
around the time of the expected stimulus onset.
Summary, Conclusion, and
Suggestions for Future Research
The duration of the decision process is a variable magnitude, certainly depending on characteristics of the consequences that will follow, but also due to limited time
resources (deadlines) and internal processes that initiate
the selection for an option. The effect of time pressure
on decision making is ambivalent, leading to both negative and positive consequences, depending on how many
cognitive resources are still available for making “good”
decisions. The instant at which a decision is finally made
is determined by both the amount of information gathered
during the decision-making process and an internal timing
mechanism that triggers the response.
Beneficial effects of time pressure on decision making
were usually explained either by the application of simplified strategies or by faster stimulus processing. However, a possible unifying framework that might account for
the compensating that occurs with time pressure is time
management. Time management means setting and pri-

oritizing goals, scheduling tasks, and monitoring progress
under limited time resources (e.g., Francis-Smythe, 2006),
and its effectiveness depends partially on how precisely
people are able to predict and judge the durations of tasks
to be done (Francis-Smythe & Robertson, 1999).
Even with decision making in choice reaction time tasks,
it seems worthwhile to further examine how the timing of
information processing is related to the time and outputs
of decision making. Neuropsychological analyses might
help in finding neuronal correlates and antecedents of the
interconnections of both processes, which could be incorporated into current models of fast decision making.
CONCLUSION
Decision making and time are closely related, as can be
seen by the five time-related topics that were identified and
selected for this article. These were (1) the time that an option takes, (2) the time intervals that individuals may discriminate by means of a hypothesized decision rule, (3) the
time between having made a decision and experiencing the
consequences of that decision, (4) the temporal perspective of decision makers, and (5) the time that the decision
process requires in order to be executed. Concerning each
topic, seminal and recent literature was reviewed, and at
the end of each section, the main results were summarized
and suggestions for further research were made.
As this review suggests, time or duration plays a twofold role in decision making. On the one hand, physical
(objective) time matters and has been related to decision
making often and extensively, particularly in the domain
of intertemporal choices. On the other hand, psychological (subjective) time has been shown to affect decisions.
However, psychological time has received less attention in
studies of decision making. One aim of this review was,
therefore, to sensitize scientists to this lack of knowledge
and to stimulate research on this issue.

NOTES
1. Block (2003) used the term experienced duration only for prospective time judgments—that is, judgments occurring after the subjects
had been told to be aware of the duration of the stimuli. However, I
prefer using this term for both prospective and retrospective temporal
judgments, since both involve the real experience of time, as compared
with imagined duration, which does not require the real experience of
duration.
2. Similar figures, derived from a delay-discounting task and illustrating reward choices as a function of the delay of the small reward,
plotted against the delay of the large reward, were presented in Ho, Mobini, Chiang, Bradshaw, and Szabadi (1999) and in Schweighofer et al.
(2006).
3. In its original version (Church & Gibbon, 1982), abs(s*  t) was
divided by s. However, applying temporal generalization to humans revealed that changing s to t as the denominator fitted the empirical data
of humans better.
4. The presentation of alternatives as either positive or negative will
substantially influence a decision maker’s choice (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979; for reviews, see also Kühberger, 1998; Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth,
1998). This effect, which is based solely on the presentational frame, is
called the framing effect.
