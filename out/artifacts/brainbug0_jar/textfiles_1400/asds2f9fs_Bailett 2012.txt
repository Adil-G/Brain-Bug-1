Technology entrepreneurship lies at the heart of many important debates, including those
around launching and growing firms, regional economic development, selecting the appropriate stakeholders to take ideas to markets, and educating managers, engineers, and
scientists. Unless a generally accepted definition of technology entrepreneurship is established, however, these debates lose their focus.
The purpose of this article is to identify the themes that dominate the technology entrepreneurship literature, provide a definition of technology entrepreneurship, and identify
its distinguishing aspects relative to economics, entrepreneurship, and management.
The author argues that technology entrepreneurship is an investment in a project that assembles and deploys specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets to create and capture value for the firm. What distinguishes technology entrepreneurship from other
entrepreneurship types (e.g., social entrepreneurship, small business management, and
self-employment) is the collaborative experimentation and production of new products,
assets, and their attributes, which are intricately related to advances in scientific and technological knowledge and the firm’s asset ownership rights.

Introduction
Technology entrepreneurship is a vehicle that facilitates
prosperity in individuals, firms, regions, and nations.
The study of technology entrepreneurship therefore,
serves an important function beyond satisfying intellectual curiosity.
Previous definitions from the literature do not explore
and identify: the ultimate outcome of technology entrepreneurship; the target of the ultimate outcomes; the
mechanism used to deliver the ultimate outcomes; or
the nature of the interdependence between technology

entrepreneurship and scientific and technological advances. Moreover, a new definition should explicitly link
technology entrepreneurship to the theory of the firm,
entrepreneurship theory, and management theory.
In this article, the journal articles on technology entrepreneurship published since 1970 are classified into
eight themes, the journals where these articles were
published are examined, and the various definitions of
technology entrepreneurship found in the literature are
identified. A revised definition of technology entrepreneurship is proposed and its distinguishing aspects discussed. The last section provides the conclusions.

Technology Entrepreneurship: Overview, Definition, and Distinctive Aspects
Tony Bailetti

Overview of Literature Search
The first symposium on technology entrepreneurship
was held at Purdue University in October 1970
(tinyurl.com/6q8ssvd). This was the first time researchers gathered together to exchange findings and
observations on this topic.
This section examines the rapid progress in the
volume and breadth of research into technology entrepreneurship since that first symposium in 1970.
Google Scholar (scholar.google.ca) was used to identify
published journal articles containing “technology”
and “entrepreneurship” or “technical” and “entrepreneurship” in the title between January 1, 1970 and
December 31, 2011. The search identified 93 articles
published in 62 journals, which were then classified

and examined more closely, as described in the sections that follow.
Table 1 organizes the 93 journal articles on technology
entrepreneurship into eight themes and five time periods: 1970–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, and
2010–2011. The duration of the first four periods is ten
years, while that of the last period is only two years.
Table 1 suggests that:
1. Over the first four time periods, the number of articles
published in each period has generally more than doubled
the number of articles published in the previous period.
2. The number of articles published in the last 12 years
accounts for 66% of the number of articles published
over the last four decades.

Themes
The information shown in Table 1 suggests that:
1. The technology entrepreneurship literature is dominated by a theme that focuses on identifying the antecedents of technology firm formation.
2. Another theme addresses the consequences of technology entrepreneurship. It focuses on how, why, and
when technology entrepreneurship affects the socioeconomic development of a region.
3. Two other themes address what occurs inside small
firms engaged in technology entrepreneurship and another theme focuses on the interdependence between
small-firm initiatives and the external infrastructure
that contributes to science and technology advances.
4. The technology entrepreneurship literature has focused more on small technology firms than mid-sized
and large firms.
5. Scholarly work on technology entrepreneurship has
not contributed substantially to other fields such as economics, entrepreneurship, or management.
The dominant theme (Theme 1) accounts for 45% of
the number of articles on technology entrepreneurship
published during the past four decades. It focuses on
external factors that influence the formation of technology firms. This theme describes the systems that support the foundation of new technology firms. The
articles cover topics on: characteristics of technology
entrepreneurs; external events that create technology
opportunities for technology entrepreneurs; university
and business incubators; firm spinoff and technology
transfer mechanisms; government programs that support technology entrepreneurship; funding of new technology firms; entrepreneurship education; and
commercialization capability.
Theme 2 focuses on how technology entrepreneurship
affects regional development. The how, why, and when
technology entrepreneurship affects the socio-economic development of a region is addressed in articles on
the relationship between technology entrepreneurship
and the regional economies of developed countries, de-

www.timreview.ca

veloping countries, and countries in transition; technology transfer mechanisms that enable entrepreneurship
in developing countries; technology as a driver of entrepreneurship in non-technology sectors; technology entrepreneurship and women’s rights; and the effect of
technology entrepreneurship on government policy.
Two additional themes (Themes 3 and 4) address what
occurs inside small firms (i.e., those with less than 50
employees). These themes account for 24% of the 93
articles and examine approaches for revenue generation, cost reduction, operations, and business transformation.
Theme 5, which accounts for 7% of the articles reviewed, focuses on the interdependence between technology initiatives carried out by small firms and
external advances in science and technology.
Corporate entrepreneurship functioning in mid-sized
and large firms (Theme 7) is the only theme that does
not focus on small technology firms or technology firm
formation. It accounts for only 4% of the total number
of articles on technology entrepreneurship.
The results suggest that scholarly work on technology
entrepreneurship has not contributed significantly to
other fields (Theme 8). Only one of the 93 articles focuses on a contribution made to another field despite
the relationship between entrepreneurship and the
wider environment (Busenitz et al., 2003; tinyurl.com/
7ar6vqy). We can surmise that the reason for this is that
the number of scholars contributing to the field of technology entrepreneurship is not large.
Figure 1 organizes seven of the eight themes shown in
Table 1 into three clusters. The overview theme (Theme
6) is not shown in Figure 1. The first cluster includes
the four themes anchored around technology venture
formation. This cluster includes themes that focus on
the antecedents (Theme 1) and consequences (Themes
2 and 8) of technology venture formation as well as its
interdependence with change in technology (Theme 5).
The second cluster includes the two themes that focus
on small technology firms (Themes 3 and 4) and the
third cluster includes the theme that focuses on midsized and large firms (Theme 7).

Journals: Domains and Rankings
To assess the quality of the journals where the 93 articles were published, criteria to identify a list of “good”
journals in technology innovation or entrepreneurship
domains were first defined and then the journals that
met the criteria were identified. To be part of the list of
“good” journals, a journal had to be: i) rated A or B by
Franke and Schreier (2008; tinyurl.com/7ma9ldq); ii) included in the Financial Times’ Top 45 Journals list (Financial Times, 2010; tinyurl.com/7f86z8e); and iii) used by
Linton in his comparison between technology innovation management journals and those journals that appear in the list of the Financial Times’ Top 45 Journals.
(2011; tinyurl.com/7u7bglg).
The remainder of this section summarizes our key findings in relation to journal domains and rankings.
1. The majority of technology entrepreneurship articles
are published in journals not considered contributors to
technology innovation or entrepreneurship
Of the 62 journals that published the 93 articles reviewed here, only 18 (29%) were considered to be journals that contribute to technology innovation
management or entrepreneurship by Franke and
Schreier (2008; tinyurl.com/7ma9ldq).
2. Two to seven journals in technology innovation and
entrepreneurship met the criteria for “good” journals
www.timreview.ca

Only two of the 62 journals that published technology
entrepreneurship articles met the criteria for a “good”
journal: Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice and
Journal of Business Venturing.
To include more journals in the list of “good journals”,
we dropped the requirement that the journal be included in the Financial Times’ Top 45 Journals list.
When we relaxed the criteria for a “good” journal, seven
journals were included in the list of “good” journals.
These are: Research Policy (5), R&D Management (4),
Journal of Business Venturing (3), International Journal
of Technology Management (2), IEEE Transactions on
Engineering Management (1), Entrepreneurship Theory
and Practice (1), and Journal of Product Innovation Management (1). The numbers in brackets refer to the number of articles in our sample published by each journal.
3. Eighteen percent of the 93 articles in Table 1 were published in seven “good” journals
We found that 17 of the 93 articles in Table 1 (18%)
were published in the seven journals that met the relaxed criteria for a good journal. Four of the 93 articles
(4%) in Table 1 were published in the two journals that
met our original criteria for a good journal.
These findings suggest that technology entrepreneurship is still a relatively new field of study. The number
of scholars publishing articles about technology entrepreneurship in top journals remains quite small.

Existing Definitions
Six definitions of technology entrepreneurship were
found in the 93 articles reviewed:
1. Organization, management, and risk bearing of a
technology based business (Nicholas and Armstrong;
2003; tinyurl.com/7tv9pdq)
2. Solutions in search of problems (Venkataraman and
Sarasvathy, 2000; tinyurl.com/7ufaes4)
3. Establishment of a new technology venture (JonesEvans, 1995; tinyurl.com/7vfgww7)
4. Ways in which entrepreneurs draw on resources and
structures to exploit emerging technology opportunities (Liu et al., 2005; tinyurl.com/6mgecu8)
5. Joint efforts to interpret ambiguous data, joint understanding to sustain technology efforts, and persistent,
coordinated endeavor to accomplish technological
change (Jelinek, 1996; tinyurl.com/783jc4n)
6. An agency that is distributed across different kinds of
actors, each of which becomes involved with a technology and, in the process, generates inputs that result in
the transformation of an emerging technological path
(Garud and Karnøe, 2003; tinyurl.com/6pdm8bn)
The definitions found in the literature suggest that technology entrepreneurship is about: i) operating small
businesses owned by engineers or scientists; ii) finding
problems or applications for a particular technology;
iii) launching new ventures, introducing new applications, or exploiting opportunities that rely on scientific
and technical knowledge; and iv) working with others
to produce technology change.

Defining Technology Entrepreneurship
The field of technology entrepreneurship is in its infancy when compared to other fields such as economics, entrepreneurship, and management. However, we
are at a point where we can leverage the insights contributed by previous work to create a clearer working
definition of technology entrepreneurship.
This article proposes a general definition that identifies
the distinctive characteristics of technology entrepreneurship and describes its links with the fields of eco-

www.timreview.ca

nomics, entrepreneurship, and management. The proposed formal definition of technology entrepreneurship should prove valuable in adding to our
understanding of how entrepreneurship functions in a
firm that invests in projects that are interdependent
with advances in science and technology.
The following definition of technology entrepreneurship is proposed:
Technology entrepreneurship is an investment
in a project that assembles and deploys specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets that are intricately related to advances in scientific and technological
knowledge for the purpose of creating and capturing
value for a firm.
The proposed definition of technology entrepreneurship is based on four elements:
1. Ultimate outcomes. Value creation and capture are
identified as two outcomes of technology entrepreneurship because the sources that create value and the
sources that capture value may not be the same over
the long run.
2. Target of the ultimate outcomes. The firm is identified as the target organization for which value is created
and captured.
3. Mechanism used to deliver the ultimate outcomes.
Investment in a project is the mechanism mobilized to
create and capture value. A project is a stock of resources (i.e., specialized individuals and heterogeneous
assets) committed to deliver the two ultimate outcome
types for a period of time.
4. Interdependence of this mechanism with scientific
and technological advances. The individuals involved
in a project influence and are influenced by advances in
relevant scientific and technology knowledge. The project exploits or explores scientific and technology knowledge. External and internal individuals and
organizations co-produce the project’s outputs.
When compared to the definitions identified in the previous section, the definition proposed above:
1. Emphasizes that technology entrepreneurship is
about creating and capturing value for the firm through
projects that combine specialists and assets to produce
and adopt technology

9

2. Highlights the collaborative experimentation and
production of new products, new assets, and their attributes, which are intricately linked to scientific and
technology advances and the firm’s asset ownership
rights
3. Specifies that technology entrepreneurship may entail projects that search for problems or applications for
a particular technology, launch new ventures, introduce new applications, and exploit opportunities that
rely on scientific and technical knowledge provided
that their ultimate outcome is to create and capture
value for the firm
4. Clarifies that technology entrepreneurship is not
about the general management practices used to operate small businesses owned by engineers or scientists
or just about small businesses

Differentiating Aspects
There are at least five differentiating aspects of technology entrepreneurship in the definition proposed above.
1. How technology entrepreneurship differentiates from
other entrepreneurship types
The interdependence between scientific and technological change, as well as the selection and development
of new products, assets, and their attributes, differentiate technological entrepreneurship from other entrepreneurship types.
Technology entrepreneurship has more to do with collaborative production based on a shared vision of future
changes
in
technology.
The
existing
entrepreneurship literature, however, describes an entrepreneur as: i) “an alert individual discovering an existing opportunity” (Shane, 2003: tinyurl.com/7ck6h95;
Shane and Venkataraman, 2000: tinyurl.com/7lgvwyw); ii)
“an innovative individual who shakes the economy out
of its previous equilibrium” (Schumpeter, 1939;
tinyurl.com/7dtghyp); iii) “an experienced individual making judgments about an unknowable future” (Foss and
Klein, 2005; tinyurl.com/7xd3xd8); iv) “an individual who
believes she has lower information costs than others”
(Casson and Wadeson, 2007; tinyurl.com/869g49o); vi) “an
individual with certain personality traits” (Hood and
Young, 1993; tinyurl.com/7nj82e3); and vi) “a charismatic
leader” (Witt, 1998; tinyurl.com/7wwqtug).
A shared vision of change in technology influences
why, when, and how a firm creates and captures value.
www.timreview.ca

Technology change can be represented in various ways.
Therefore, it is important to develop a shared view of
change in technology.
2. Eliminating the existing biases in the entrepreneurship literature
The proposed definition eliminates three biases of entrepreneurship research: i) concentration on new firm
formation; ii) focus on individual entrepreneurs; and
iii) over-attention to opportunity discovery (Foss, 2011;
tinyurl.com/6wamh2j).
Technology entrepreneurship, as defined above, applies equally well to newly formed or established firms
as well as small or large firms. Established and large
firms can engage in technology entrepreneurship just
as well as startups do.
Technology entrepreneurship is about collaborative
production decisions, not about a single individual
making or delegating decisions. The firm’s top management team jointly decides to invest in a project and a
team of specialized individuals who create and capture
value for the firm. The specialized individuals and assets can be held by a single entrepreneur-manager or
can be distributed.
Technology entrepreneurship involves specialized human resources, tapping into their skills and ability to
collaboratively explore and exploit scientific and technological change to benefit the firm. Technology entrepreneurship is best understood therefore, as a
joint-production phenomenon that draws from a team
of specialized individuals from multiple domains, some
or all of whom become embedded in the technology
path they try to shape in real time (Garud and Karnøe,
2003; tinyurl.com/6pdm8bn). Technology entrepreneurship
is not about a single individual or the inventions they
introduce. It is about managing joint exploration and
exploitation, where each individual has roles and responsibilities in collaboratively and cooperatively moving forward toward accomplishing shared goals
(Lindenberg and Foss, 2011; tinyurl.com/6oh6yuo). Technology entrepreneurship is about investing in and executing the firms’ projects, not just recognizing technology
or market opportunities.
3. A more theoretically rigorous and practical definition
Considering technology entrepreneurship as an investment in a project rather than a subjective opportunity
allows it to be assessed in more theoretically rigorous
and practical terms. It transforms the subjective view of

10

<-----Page 6----->Technology Innovation Management Review

February 2012

Technology Entrepreneurship: Overview, Definition, and Distinctive Aspects
Tony Bailetti
technology or market ideas to the objective reality of
project definition, financing, and execution. The proposed definition links technology entrepreneurship to
an amount of money (i.e., investment in the project).
Ideas are mere parlour games until money is part of a
project (Rothbard, 1985; tinyurl.com/75f2boc).
4. Linking technology entrepreneurship to the theory of
sustainable competitive advantage
Technology entrepreneurship and the resource-based
view of sustainable competitive advantage (tinyurl.com/
753qbxo) are interdependent because they are both concerned with how to create and capture value. Both pay
explicit attention to how resources that embody technology and scientific advances create and capture value.
While technology entrepreneurship applies to any firm
with projects that rely on advances of science and technology, the resource-based view applies to those few
firms that are continuously successful.
The resource-based theory of sustainable competitive
advantage is the dominant view in strategic management. It links firm performance to firm resources and
includes concepts such as capabilities, dynamic capabilities, and core competences. Scholars working in this
field seek to clarify how a firm can create and capture
more value than its competitors on a sustained basis
(Peteraf and Barney, 2003; tinyurl.com/8x8qfmt).
For value-creation activities to endure over the long
term, the amount customers pay the firm must be: i)
greater than the firm’s cost of production and ii) a function of the difference between the satisfaction customers receive from consuming the firm’s goods or services
and the satisfaction customers would receive from consuming the closest alternative goods or services. For the
firm to capture the value it creates, “use value” (i.e., utility of consuming a good) and “exchange value” (i.e.,
price paid for the good) should be similar. If use value is
high and exchange value is low, other agents (e.g., intermediaries, competitors) are capturing the value created
for customers (Lepak et al., 2007; tinyurl.com/6rmbk6g).
5. Linking technology entrepreneurship to the theory of
the firm
The technology entrepreneurship domain and the theory of the firm are interdependent through the specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets committed
to a project for the purpose of creating and retaining
value for the firm.

www.timreview.ca

The specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets
in the project’s stock of resources can be considered reference points in the theory of the firm. The theory of
the firm aims to explain why firms exist, what determines their boundaries, what determines their structure,
and what drives their different actions and performances.
The proposed definition emphasizes the importance of
technology entrepreneurship in enabling specialized individuals to develop combinations of assets and their
attributes in order to create and capture value for the
firm. An “asset” refers to an economic resource that is
owned or controlled by the firm and is used to create
and capture value for the firm. An asset represents
value ownership that the firm may convert into cash.
An asset can be thought of as a bundle of attributes
defined by their characteristics, functions, and potential uses. The term “heterogeneous assets” refers to a
set of assets that lack uniformity in composition or
character.
The firm’s owners and employees have no way of knowing or predicting the relevant attributes of all the assets.
Asset attributes need to be discovered. Technological
entrepreneurship identifies, selects, and develops new
attributes for the purpose of creating and capturing
value for the firm.
Technology entrepreneurship requires a firm for two
reasons. First, the firm must control the assets that specialized individuals use to experiment with new combinations of assets and their attributes. Second, the
requisite joint investment and production decisions
cannot be purchased on the market. The reasons that
technology entrepreneurship needs a firm are similar to
the reasons why an entrepreneur needs a firm described
by Foss, Klein, and Bylund (2011; tinyurl.com/8xfhvlg).

Conclusion
Over the last four decades, technology entrepreneurship has become an increasingly important global phenomenon. It is perceived as necessary for growth,
differentiation, and competitive advantage at the firm,
regional, and national levels. Technology entrepreneurship appeals mainly to leaders and top management
teams of small and large firms who use technology to
create, deliver, and capture value for their stakeholders.
Technology entrepreneurship also appeals to person-

About the Author

The primary function of technology entrepreneurship
is to assemble a combination of specialized individuals
and heterogeneous assets in order to create and capture value for the firm through collaborative exploration and experimentation. The combination, some of
the assets, or the assets’ attributes may be unique and
novel. The initial combination may change over time.

The article offered a definition for technology entrepreneurship. A better definition of technology entrepreneurship can help improve its performance,
increase its relevance, and establish it as a legitimate
domain of inquiry in its own right. This definition
needs to identify and incorporate the various distinctive aspects of technology entrepreneurship and its links
to the existing domains of economics, entrepreneurship, and management. The definition, including the
corresponding features and links, requires particular attention from scholars and practitioners.
The aspects of technology entrepreneurship to which
we need to pay particular attention are identified.
These aspects are: i) the interdependence between scientific and technological change and the selection and
development of new combinations, assets, and asset attributes; ii) biases in the existing entrepreneurship literature;
iii)
conceptualization
of
technology
entrepreneurship as an investment in a project, rather
than opportunity recognition or venture formation; and
iv) links among technology entrepreneurship, the theory of sustainable competitive advantage, and the theory of the firm.
