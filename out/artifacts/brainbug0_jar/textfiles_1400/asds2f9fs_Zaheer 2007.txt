W e develop a model of relational governance as a specijic form of interorganizational
strategy that is distinct from the traditional modes of markets and hierarchies. W e
conceptualize this form of strategy in t e r m of structural and processual dimensions and
derive a model of its determinants through arguments drawn from transaction cost economics
and the sociological exchange literature. Hierarchical regression modeling is employed to
test the theoretical model o n data collected from a sample of 329 independent insurance
agencies. W e include the relational variable of trust and demonstrate that the combined
model explains relational governance better than a model with the traditional determinants
of governance form alone. Further, we observe that governance structure and process are
related and discuss implications of the dynamic link between them. Directions for extensions
are developed for strategic management research and practice.

A current research thrust in organizational
economics and strategic management is focused
on 'intermediate' modes of governance, distinct
from the traditional modes of market and
hierarchy (Williamson, 1975, 1991). Intermediate
modes of governance may serve as alternative
governance structures to vertical financial ownership (Mahoney, 1992; Ring and Van de Ven,
1992). These take several forms such as joint
ventures (Harrigan, 1985a; Kogut, 1988), strategic
partnerships between suppliers and buyers (Heide
and John, 1990), technology licensing (Koh and
Venkatraman, 1991) and alliances (James, 1985;

Lewis, 1990). Such governance modes have been
variously termed as hybrids (Williamson, 1991)
or networks (e.g., Eccles and Crane, 1987), and
are not only widespread in the contemporary
business environment, but are increasing greatly
in number (Harrigan, 1988). Further, their
strategic importance is growing (Thorelli, 1986;
Powell, 1987, 1990); for example, networks are
said to enhance the competitive positioning of
firms (Jarillo, 1988). Research into intermediate
governance modes has significant implications
for strategic management as it explores critical
choices relating to the scope of the firm and to
firm boundaries.
This paper builds on transaction cost reasoning
(Williamson, 1975,1985) and evaluates an emerging view that noneconomic factors, primarily

embodied in trust-which we term 'sociological'
in order to distinguish them from more traditional
transaction cost determinants-are
complementary to economic ones in the governance of
exchange relationships (Dore, 1983,1987; Granovetter, 1985; Lazerson, 1988; Ring and Van de
Ven, 1992). In other words, we are interested in
understanding the determinants-both economic
and sociological--of
relational governance
(Macneil, 1980; Williamson, 1985; Dwyer, Schurr,
and Oh, 1987). Further, the paper views relational
governance as embodied in both the structure
and the process of an interorganizational
relationship-specifically, one involving exchange.
Thus, we draw on research streams on transaction
cost economics and sociological exchange perspectives to develop a research model which is
empirically tested in a service industry by using
data from the commercial segment of the U.S.
property and casualty (P&C) insurance industry
(see also Etgar, 1978; Cummins and VanDerhei,
1979).
More generally, our paper responds to Hill's
(1990) call for a greater research focus on the
nature and effects of the 'long-term cooperative
relationships' between economic actors. Further,
this work is in line with Hansen and Wernerfelt
(1989), who integrated economic and behavioralsociological factors to explain firm performance
and stressed the need for research attention to
multidisciplinary approaches in explaining firmlevel phenomena.

RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES
Relational governance: A conceptualization
The transaction cost perspective argues that the
transaction costs of exchange are the most
significant determinants of the governance form.
Transaction costs are largely determined by the
extent to which the assets of the parties to the
relationship are specialized to the transaction
that occurs between them (Klein, Crawford, and
Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1985). In order to
protect transaction-specific assets from opportunistic appropriation, firms will choose to internalize
the transaction or otherwise arrange to increase
the extent of hierarchical control over the other
party to the relationship.
While traditionally the choice of governance
has been cast in terms of the two polar extremes,

market or hierarchy (Coase, 1937; Williamson,
1975), this paper is focused on intermediate
governance modes-specifically
on relational
governance. It builds on the assertion articulated
by Macneil (1978, 1980), Dore (1987), and
others, that contracting is never completely
discrete (i.e., anonymous, characterized by limited
communication, as assumed by neoclassical
theories) but that even the most fundamental
model of discrete exchange includes some
relational e1ements.l Use of the term 'relational
governance' in this paper suggests interfirm
exchange which includes significant relationshipspecific assets, combined with a high level of
interorganizational trust. This is consistent with
Ring and Van de Ven (1992).
The relational nature of contracting owes its
origins to Macneil (1978, 1980), who views a
contract as reflecting 'the relations among parties
to the process of projecting exchange into the
future' (1980: 4). Central to Macneil's argument
is the proposition that relational exchange is
based on a social component, largely represented
by trust. Specifically, the parties involved in
relational exchange derive 'non-economic satisfactions and engage in social exchange as well as
. . . economic exchange' (Macneil, 1980: 13;
emphasis added). Further '. . . modern relations
. . . just like primitive relations, require solidarity
and hence a degree of trust, or faith in others,
to work successfully' (1980: 21; emphasis added).
This line of reasoning is consistent with the
work of sociologists such as Powell (1990) and
Granovetter (1985), who develop the notion of
embeddedness. Specifically, these scholars have
argued for recognizing the role played by socially
embedded personal relationships in economic
exchange. Economic exchange relations thus
depart from 'pure economic motives' and 'become
overlaid with social content that carries strong
expectations of trust and abstention from opportunism' (Granovetter, 1985: 490). The significant
social component in economic action is generally
ignored in economic explanations of exchange
activity, and is frequently consigned to the error
term or to 'noise' (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
However, economists such as Arrow (1973: 24)
have also recognized that 'there is an element of
trust in every transaction'.

' As a reviewer rightly points out, nor is exchange ever
completely hierarchical, as long as exit is an option.

<-----Page 3----->Relational Governance
In a similar vein, Dore (1987) invokes examples
from the Japanese textile industry to argue
for the significance of sociological elements in
exchange. Specifically, he discusses the role that
continuity, mutual dependence, trust, and social
norms play in the maintenance of exchange
relationships between supplier and buyer firms.
He argues that similar considerations intervene
to a greater extent than is generally believed in
Western business contexts as well (see also
Macauley, 1963). Hill (1990) argues that contrary
to the classic transaction cost view that opportunism generally characterizes exchange, it is
relationships based on cooperation and trust that
are more likely to survive in the marketplace.
His rationale is that 'opportunism, the safeguards
needed to check opportunism, and internalization
as a response to opportunism dissipate the
composite quasi rent' (1990: 511), and actors
who do not cooperate and trust each other will
therefore tend to be less efficient than those who
do. Competitive pressures will tend to select out
inefficient relationships and firms that enter into
them, leaving behind the more efficient, trustbased ones. Thus, empirically, the assumption
that opportunism characterizes exchange should
be reconsidered in favor of one that suggests
that trust does.
Transaction cost theorists such as Williamson
(1985) have recognized the abundance of intermediate governance forms and suggest that,
under certain conditions, these 'relational' forms
are maintained by economic weapons such as
hostages and credible commitments to keep
opportunistic behavior at bay. However, this
view of relational governance is somewhat at
variance from that articulated by Macneil (1980)
and Dore (1987), who conceive of relational
exchange as supported by non-economic factors
such as trust. It is possible that over time,
relational forms evolve from using economic
safeguards to protect specific assets to employing
trust in this way (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
Dimensionalizing governance as structure and
process

We view relational governance as comprised of
two basic underlying dimensions: (a) the structure
of the relationship-conceptualized in terms of
the degree of vertical quasi-integration (Blois,
1972) reflecting the degree of market or hier-

375

archical structuring of the transaction; and (b)
the process underlying the relationship-conceptualized in terms of the degree of joint action
(Heide and John, 1990) in the exchange relationship. More broadly, the governance structure in
this discussion is viewed as the interunit or
interj5rm framework within which exchange takes
place. The use of the term 'structure' here refers
to 'governance' structure, which we emphasize
is quite distinct from organizational structure.
The latter concept is most frequently used to
describe the administrative relationships within
an organization. Governance process refers to
the interunit or interfirm activities that accompany
exchange within the framework of the governance
structure.
We argue that viewing relational governance
in terms of both structure and process is important
since a combination of structural and processual
dimensions more completely describes the complexity of such intermediate relationships than
either the structure or the process dimension
alone. Of course, structure and process are
closely related, as we discuss in more detail later.
The choice of the form of governance, specifically
the determination of the appropriate governance
structure and process, is broadly defined as the
interorganizational strategy of the firm. More
specifically, since we develop our theoretical and
empirical arguments in the contexts of a vertical
exchange relationship, we can refer to this type
of interorganizational strategy as a vertical control
strategy. In this paper, we use the two terms
interchangeably . 2
Quasi-integration as a structural dimension
We define vertical quasi-integration as a 'close
relationship which is based primarily upon the
[firm's] dependence for a significant proportion
of its total business upon a particular [firm]'
(Blois, 1972: 267). Blois asserts that a relationship
of this type involves an interdependence between
the two firms such that it 'can be considered as
a type of vertical integration without the legal
form' (1972: 268). We argue that this is a
structural dimension of governance, since it
While we have focused on interorganizational strategy, a
more precise view is offered by Mahoney (1992) that vertical
control strategy is distinct from the choice of governance
form.

<-----Page 4----->376

captures the transactional form of the dyad in
terms of the extent of market or hierarchical
mediation of transactions. The rationale for
conceptualizing quasi-integration as governance
structure becomes clearer from the limiting case
when 100 percent of a firm's output goes to a
single buyer. Although such a situation does not
automatically imply a hierarchical relationship,
for exchange could conceivably be based entirely
on price, in practical terms it is rare to find pure
price-based contracts in these contexts. Such a
relationship in fact would be tantamount to a
hierarchical one if exchange occurred repeatedly.
As Macneil (1978: 898) notes, '[als contractual
relations expand, those relations take on more
and more the characteristics of mini societies
and mini states.' Eccles (1981) calls stable,
long-term relationships between contractors and
subcontractors 'quasi-firms' for the same reason.
We argue that higher degrees of quasiintegration imply a stable, long-term relationship
between buyer and supplier. This form of
relationship is distinct from a spot market,
occasional transaction, for it implies continuing
transactions between buyer and seller. When
quasi-integration is high, the expectation is that
the volume of such transactions account for a
significant proportion of the seller's output over
multiple periods of time. Our use of vertical
quasi-integration as a manifestation of governance
is consistent with previous empirical research,
such as John and Weitz (1988), testing transaction
cost explanations for vertical integration.
We further suggest that the higher the level
of quasi-integration, the greater the costs of
terminating the relationship for the exchange
partners (Kay, 1992). This proposition follows
from our previous argument that higher quasiintegration generally implies a larger component
of nonprice, or 'hierarchical' elements in the
relationship. The existence of such nonprice
elements in an exchange relationship suggests a
relational contract, and we argue that terminating
a relational contract is costlier than terminating
a discrete contract.

Joint action serves as a safeguard for transactionspecific investments since firms that invest in
relationships with other firms would like to
reduce the risks of opportunistic appropriation
by getting involved in joint activities (Leenders
and Blenkhorn, 1988). Joint action is viewed as
governance process since it comprises a set of
decision process mechanisms that determine the
terms of exchange between the members of the
dyad (Achrol, Reve, and Stern, 1983) and due
to its focus on future exchange and implications
of a cooperative endeavor. The rationale is that
the joint responsibility for the activities of the
dyad will serve to protect the party with specific
assets from their appropriation. From a macroorganization perspective, joint action provides
an appropriate mechanism for planning and
forecasting, in addition to the coopting of
environmental elements, and thus would appear
to serve as a process counter to organizational
dependence by reducing the uncertainty caused
for the organization by environmental elements
(Thompson, 1967; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978).

Joint action as a process dimension

Asset spec@city as a determinant of transaction
costs

Joint action reflects a move toward closer
relationships which 'involves the parties carrying
out the focal activities in a cooperative or
coordinated way' (Heide and John, 1990: 25).

Determinants of governance from the
transaction cost perspective

We consider three key determinants of transaction
costs-(a) the degree of transaction-specific assets
(or asset specificity); (b) the level of uncertainty;
and (c) the extent of reciprocal investments-in
this section. Asset specificity, by creating a small
numbers exchange condition, has been argued
to be a key source of transaction costs. Similarly,
uncertainty has been a prominent factor in
previous empirical studies of vertical integration
using the transaction cost approach (e.g., Anderson and Schmittlein, 1984). Reciprocal investments (or reciprocal asset specificity) refer to
transaction-specific investments by the other
party to the exchange and are akin to being a
mirror image of asset specificity. Reciprocal
assets may tend to moderate opportunism by
serving as 'hostages' in an exchange (Williamson,
1985).

Asset specificity has been extensively employed in
empirical research (see, for instance, Monteverde
and Teece, 1982; Walker and Weber, 1984;

<-----Page 5----->Relational Governance
Heide and John, 1990; Anderson and Weitz,
1991) on transaction cost explanations for vertical
integration. Given our focus on a service industry
as a research context, rather than considering
physical asset specificity, we develop the concept
of business process asset specificity-which incorporates components of both human asset specificity (Williamson, 1975, 1985) and procedural
asset specificity as discussed below.
Human asset speciJicity deals with the degree
to which skills, knowledge and experience of a
firm's personnel are specific to the requirements
of dealing with another firm in a vertical
relationship. Anderson (1985) considered specialized human knowledge in sales operations as
representing human asset specificity given her
focus on the salesperson's role as an agent (vs.
an employee). Masten, Meehan, and Snyder
(1991) conceptualized specialized technical
knowledge in ship building as reflecting human
asset specificity. John and Weitz (1988) operationalize human asset specificity in terms of the
level of training and experience specific to the
product-line in distribution channels.
Procedural asset speciJicity refers to the degree
a firm's workflows and processes are customized
in line with the requirements of the exchange
partner (Malone, Yates, and Benjamin, 1987).
This notion is akin to the concept of organizational
routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982) which are
hard to alter once established, and may have
involved significant investments in terms of
training and specialization. Dealing with a regular
exchange partner, particularly when the product
or the transaction is complex, can clearly result
in transaction-specific routines which may not
transfer easily to another partner. We need to
discriminate between organizational routines that
are likely to become so transaction-specific that
they are expensive to redeploy, and those that
do not have such asset-specific characteristics.
While there is clearly a continuum of organizational routines along an asset-specific dimension,
we venture that routines which are highly
complex, or those that are set up to handle
highly specialized products or services produced
by an exchange partner, will possess greater
procedural asset specificity. In the case of
the insurance agencies dealing with complex
commercial products from their focal carriers,
such procedural asset specificity can be reasonably
assumed.

377

Integrating these two components of asset
specificity, we argue that the greater level of
business process asset specificity creates an
increased requirement for the governance form to
offset the dependence caused by such specific assets.
Put differently, a higher degree of dependence due
to higher investments made in business processes-both people and procedure-requires
that the
relationship include greater safeguards so that its
transaction-specific assets are not opportunistically
appropriated. Since a higher level of quasiintegration imposes higher termination costs on
both the parties to the exchange (Kay, 1992), it
can serve effectively as the requisite safeguard.
Thus, we expect a positive effect of asset specificity
on quasi-integration:

Hypothesis 1: Asset specificity is positively
and signiJicantly associated with greater degrees
of quasi-integration.
Uncertainty as a determinant of transaction costs
Uncertainty has been commonly employed as a
determinant of transaction costs in the literature
on pressures for vertical integration (Walker and
Weber, 1984; John and Weitz, 1988). In an
exchange context, the relevant form of uncertainty is 'behavioral uncertainty' (Williamson,
1985), which could be viewed as a subset
of Koopmans' (1957) 'secondary uncertainty.'
Behavioral uncertainty arises from the difficulty
in predicting the actions of the other party in
the relationship, in view of the potential for
opportunistic behavior and since bounded rationality precludes the writing of complete contingent
contracts. As contingencies develop, it becomes
costlier to conduct transactions in pure market
settings since opportunistic parties may reinterpret contract terms to suit themselves.
In addition, macro-organizational theorists have
argued for the role of uncertainty in defining the
boundaries of the firm. For example, Thompson
(1967) specifically postulates that 'organizations
. . . seek to place their boundaries around those
activities, which if left to the task environment
would be crucial contingencies' (1967: 39). Stinchcombe (1990) asserts that relationships incorporate
more elements of hierarchy when dealing with
higher levels of uncertainty. Since a higher
degree of vertical quasi-integration implies greater
hierarchy, we derive the following hypothesis:

<-----Page 6----->378

A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman

Hypothesis 2a: Uncertainty is positively and
significantly associated with greater degrees of
quasi-integration.
Once a high degree of quasi-integration has
been achieved between the partners to the
exchange, behavioral uncertainty would tend to
be moderated. Since our research model is a
cross-sectional one, we are not in a position to
capture the temporal sequence of events, and
accordingly develop an alternative hypothesis
which suggests a negative relationship between
uncertainty and quasi-integration.

Hypothesis 2b: Uncertainty is negatively and
signijicantly associated with greater degrees of
quasi-integration.
Reciprocal investments
Reciprocal investments-namely, transaction-specific investments in the relationship by the other
partner to the exchange--can serve as a credible
commitment in an exchange relationship. Such
investments balance the transaction-specific investments made by the one party in the exchange
relationship, and thereby signal continuity and
imply a guarantee to a stable, long-term relationship
(Williamson, 1985; Anderson and Weitz, 1991).
Actions that suggest reciprocity and commitment
to the interorganizational relationship by the parties
to the exchange also tend to reinforce the bonds
between them as well as expand the extent of
mutual cooperation. Since reciprocal investments
protect the transaction-specific investments of the
focal party in the relationship, they moderate the
trading hazard and would consequently tend
to lower the need for other protection from
opportunism. Hence, we hypothesize the extent of
reciprocal investments as a negative determinant
of increased hierarchical governance, exemplified
by quasi-integration:

Hypothesis 3: Reciprocal investments are
negatively and signijicantly associated with
greater degrees of quasi-integration.
Trust as a sociological element of exchange
The presence of trust in exchange is a basic
postulate of a socialized view of relationships
(Granovetter, 1985). Defined in contracting

behavior terms, trust reflects 'the extent to which
negotiations are fair and commitments are upheld'
(Anderson and Narus, 1990) and one party's
belief that its requirements will be fulfilled
through future actions undertaken by the other
party (Anderson and Weitz, 1989). Trust behavior
is viewed as an important element of long-term
hierarchy-like relationships (Williamson, 1985;
Dore, 1987; Aoki, 1990; Mahoney, Huff, and
Huff, 1994) and is a necessary condition for
relational governance (Macneil, 1980; Granovetter, 1985).
It is important to distinguish between forms
of trust, arising from various sources. Different
mechanisms are implied in the creation of each
form. Sociologists such as Zucker (1986) have
identified three forms: (1) characteristic-based
trust, which is formed within a group on the
basis of factors such as ethnicity; (2) processbased trust, which results from past and expected
future exchanges; and (3) institutional-based trust,
which stems from embedded social practices
(Dore, 1987; Jarillo, 1988). The extensive psychological and sociological literature on trust has
also distinguished between affective, cognitive,
and behavioral dimensions of trust (Lewis and
Weigert, 1985). Williamson (1993) makes a
further distinction between calculative, personal,
and institutional trust. The first refers to a
'rational' form of trust fostered by mutual
hostages and built upon reputation effects (Kreps,
1990). Williamson (1993) suggests that this type
of trust is similar to risk. Personal trust, on the
other hand, is akin to 'altruistic' behavior-it
does not depend on calculations of self-interest
for its formation or continuation, and applies
only in close personal relations. The third form
of trust, institutional trust, derives from the
social and organizational embeddedness, but in
fact, according to Williamson (1993), is calculative
as well.
If we examine Zucker's typology of the sources
of trust discussed above in Williamson's terms,
we could view them all as being of the 'calculative'
kind to a certain extent, since each depends on
sanctions of some type for its existence. Thus,
the maintenance of characteristic-based trust
depends on sanctions of some kind by members
of an ethnic group, process-based trust relies
on the expectations of future exchange, and
institutional-based trust is dependent on legal or
other sanctions to enforce trusting behavior. Again,

<-----Page 7----->Relational Governance
the 'cognitive' dimension of trust is close to
'calculative' trust, while the 'affective' trust dimension probably includes the altruistic type of trust.
However, the 'behavioral' dimension of trust does
not fit neatly within a calculative- altruistic
dichotomy, but could include elements of both.
Williamson (1993) suggests that the term 'trust'
should be reserved for the personal, altruistic
version alone, and commercial relations cannot
include trust defined in this manner. We modify
this conception of trust in three important ways:
first, we believe that trust is a complex notion, and
that calculativeness, or a cognitive component, is
one element of trust. However, trust is a
"'leap" beyond the expectations that reason and
experience alone would warrant-they simply
serve as the platform from which the leap is
made' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985: 970). Thus,
both the rational calculation and the 'leap of
faith' comprise trust. Second, we allow for a
sizable sociological component of trust, captured
by the 'mutuality' intrinsic in the notion of
interorganizational trust. Thus, trust begets trust,
and a situation develops where 'I trust because
you trust' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Third, we
believe that such a form of trust is common in
business relationships, even in the West.
Considerable evidence exists to support the
idea that dyadic business relationships often have
a strong non-economic flavor. In this regard,
the social embeddedness of economic actions
(Granovetter, 1985) is noteworthy, as is the
tendency for commercial relationships to be
closely interwoven with personal ones, which has
been documented both in the West and in Japan
(Macauley, 1963; Dore, 1983, 1987). Thus, our
focus in this research is on trust as a property
of the interorganizational dyad, and is primarily
sociological in nature, although we believe that
trust is a multidimensional concept, significantly
developed on affective, behavioral and cognitive
bases as well.
The rationale for the key role of trust is
straightforward: in the extreme case, it does away
with formal contracts, which are costly to write,
monitor and enforce (Bromiley and Cummings,
1991). Thus, trust acts to reduce transaction costs
by reducing or eliminating both ex ante and ex
post opportunism. Arguing from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint, therefore, the presence of trust
should be associated with a lower level of
hierarchical governance since trust serves as a

379

substitute for hierarchical control. These arguments
are formalized in the hypothesis below:

Hypothesis #a: Trust is negatively and signijicantly associated with greater degrees of quasiintegration.
However, the above reasoning assumes that
increased trust levels precede the observed
governance form. Put another way, an argument
that asserts that interorganizational trust is in
place before safeguards are established makes
assumptions about the temporal structure of the
model, which we are not in a position to test
conclusively since ours is a cross-sectional rather
than a longitudinal study. If on the other hand
we argue that it is the increased levels of quasiintegration or the extent of recurrent exchange
that gave rise to the observed level of trust, then
it would imply a hypothesis with the signs
reversed, or that closer interorganizational ties
will be associated with higher levels of trust. From
a sociological perspective the latter hypothesis,
which we term the alternate hypothesis, appears
to have greater force validity. The corresponding
hypothesis relating governance structure to the
levels of trust in the relationship is as follows:

Hypothesis 4b: Trust is positively and sign@cantly associated with greater degrees of quasiintegration.
The complementary role of the two perspectives
We argue that the inclusion of the sociological
perspective, expressed as trust, will add significantly to the explanatory power to the models
of transaction cost explanations of the structure
of governance, for the reasons discussed in earlier
sections. We test this assertion through the
following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 5: A model of quasi-integration
that includes variables from both the economic
and sociological perspectives will have significantly increased explanatory power than a
model that includes only the economic variables.
Relating quasi-integration and joint action
We now consider the relationship between the
two dimensions of governance outcomes, quasi-

<-----Page 8----->380

integration and joint action. We suggest that a
dynamic relationship exists between the two
dimensions and propose that it is the development
of trust between the exchange partners to relational
exchange that, together with governance
structure-quasi-integration-contribute to the
establishment and enhancement of governance
process outcomes, operationalized in joint action.
In essence, we argue that governance structure
is but the first phase in the development of
relational governance. As the interfirm relationship develops with the context of recurrent
transactions between the two parties, social
elements and relational norms, epitomized by
trust, become established in the relationship
(Ring and Van de Ven, 1992). Subsequently, the
parties come to rely on these relational norms
to adopt process elements that serve as safeguards
in their relationship, contributing to a more
durable, stable, long-term relationship. While we
cannot demonstrate the foregoing in a crosssectional study such as this, we draw on theoretical
bases to buttress our argument.
Stinchcombe's (1990) work on contracts as
substitutes for hierarchies makes a similar point:
rather than a formal hierarchical structure, it is
the provisions for processes such as those
for conflict resolution and standard operating
procedures-some built-in, others evolved-that
often underlie exchange in the real world. The
reasoning is also consistent with the spirit of
Grossman and Hart's (1986) rationale for defining
a firm. Simply put, their definition of the
boundaries of a firm extends beyond mere formal
ownership of assets to the notion of control over
assets, which is essentially analogous to what we
define as process. Thus, process, rather than
formal structure, may be the key to explaining
the boundaries of a firm.
In the current research context, the foregoing
implies that the recurrent transactions that occur
with quasi-integration will form the structural
basis for the development of the governance
process, exemplified by joint action. This idea
leads to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 6: Quasi-integration and joint
action are positively and signijicantly related.
However, the power of the governance
structure-quasi-integration-in
explaining joint
action will, as we have argued, be substantially

enhanced with the addition of a sociological
component: trust. The following hypothesis captures this notion:

Hypothesis 7: The model of joint action that
includes trust will have significantly greater
explanatory power than a model that includes
only quasi-integration.
Size as a control variable
Empirical research on vertical integration using
the transaction cost approach has often included
size as a variable, since larger supplier or
customer firms will be harder to integrate within
a hierarchy, all else being equal (e.g., Anderson,
1985). However, we do not explicitly hypothesize
a direction for the variable of firm size in our
model, but include it as a control variable.

METHODS
Research setting
The P&C insurance industry in the U.S. served
as the setting for testing the research model.
The P&C industry offers protection against such
risks as fire, theft, accident and general liability.
Coverage is provided to both personal and
commercial customers; the former include individuals (for automobile and homeowner insurance)
and the latter business policy-holders (for general
liability and workers' compensation, among
others). P&C insurance is largely sold through
independent insurance agencies who can choose
to place the insurance risks of their clients with
whichever insurance company, or carrier, best
meets their requirements. While insurance agencies typically deal with a number of insurance
carriers, agencies will often elect to give the bulk
of their business to a single insurance companythe 'lead' market or 'focal' carrier. However,
agencies differ widely in their degree of dependency on the focal insurance carriers (or, the
extent of quasi-integration) as well as in the
extent of joint action with the carriers, thus
providing an appropriate setting for testing the
research model.
We restricted our study to the commercial
lines segment where independent agencies are
the dominant form for the distribution of P&C
insurance, writing over 77 percent of total

<-----Page 9----->Relational Governance
commercial premiums in 1988 (Best's Review,
1990). Thus, we exclude direct distribution, and
seek to explain the extent to which independent
agencies are quasi-integrated with their focal
insurance carriers.

Hypothesis 5 supported. As hypothesized, the
results showed that the combination of economic

Hypothesis 6 supported. As hypothesized, quasiintegration, the structural form of governance,
is positively and significantly related to joint

in terms of uncertainty about the actions of
the exchange partner. Despite operationalizing
uncertainty as behavioral uncertainty, the construct emerged non-significant. Further, it was
negatively signed, which was contradictory to
transaction cost predictions.
Alternatively, it is possible that the nature of
this statistical relationship is nonlinear, and one
may speculate that when increased hierarchical
coordination leads to an ambiguous change
in control over uncertainty, organizations in
intermediate governance modes will reduce rather
than increase their degree of hierarchical coordination when uncertainty is high, if total integration is not a possibility. Of course (as a
reviewer pionts out), our operationalization of
hierarchy as quasi-integration is not identical to
the class transaction cost conception, which could
account for the construct of uncertainty being
non-significant with respect to governance choice.
Also, in terms of measurement, the uncertainty
construct itself was weaker than we would have
liked. However, our results are consistent with
a temporal explanation that closer ties reduce
behavioral uncertainty.

DISCUSSION
Asset specificity
Our empirical tests found support for the classic
transaction cost variable of asset specificity,
consistent with previous empirical research. In
accordance with transaction cost reasoning, asset
specificity was positively and significantly related
to the structural dimension of governance. One
distinctive aspect of this research relates to our
operationalization of asset specificity in terms of
both human and procedural asset specificity,
where the latter is analogous to organization
routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Such routines
embody a powerful form of transaction-specific
assets in service firms with strong vertical
linkages.
Uncertainty
The coefficient for uncertainty was not statistically
significant in the model. In order to be consistent
with previous empirical research on transaction
costs (e.g., Anderson, 1985), an alternative
specification of the model was tested, with an
interaction term between uncertainty and asset
specificity. The coefficient was again found to
be non-significant.
In fact, the construct of uncertainty has proved
controversial due to contradictory empirical
findings. For instance, counter to the classic
transaction cost arguments, Harrigan (1985b)
found that uncertainty was negatively related to
vertical integration, as did Balakrishnan and
Wernerfelt (1986). The latter authors argued that
this empirical finding was due to their having
operationalized uncertainty as technological
uncertainty of high specificity, which would
decrease the likelihood of investment in such
technology. However, others (e.g., Monteverde
and Teece, 1982) have demonstrated that when
the form of technological uncertainty stems
from the requirements of coordinating complex
technical systems, a positive relationship between
uncertainty and internalization is observed. Our
operationalization of this construct is consistent
with Williamson (1985), who views uncertainty

Reciprocal investments
We introduced and operationalized the concept
of reciprocal investments in a model of relational
governance, and found that this variable was a
not significant explanatory factor of structural
governance outcomes. However, we note that
the correlation between reciprocal investments
and joint action is strong and significant,
r = 0.378 (Table 2). This result suggests that
reciprocal investments may play a salient role in
joint action, although we did not specify such a
relationship ex ante.
On the other hand, if reciprocal investments
in the relationship are viewed once again from
a sociological perspective as reciprocity, possibly
including a dynamic component, then the strong
observed correlation between reciprocal investments and joint action becomes both theoretically
and intuitively plausible. Thus, for example,
norms of reciprocity and reciprocal action theory
(Gouldner, 1960) imply that each partner in the
exchange relationship responds to the actions
taken by the other in a reciprocal fashion.
Exchange theory (Homans, 1961) and equity
norms (Blau, 1964) are similar expressions of

<-----Page 16----->388

conditions supporting stable exchange relationships. Reciprocal action serves as the basis for
mutual commitment (Dwyer et al., 1987) and
symmetric levels of commitment favor longevity
and stability in relationships. The recognition in
the game-theoretic literature of infinite horizon
games and the empirical demonstration that a
tit-for-tat strategy is most optimal under those
circumstances (Axelrod, 1984) provides further
evidence for the role of reciprocity in long-term
relational exchange. We suggest that as attention
to interorganizational strategy increases, consideration should be given to reciprocal investments and reciprocity in research on governance.
Trust
The role of trust, although consistent with
an alternative hypothesis based on sociological
explanations, was found to be the opposite of
what was hypothesized from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint. In order to further investigate
the phenomenon of trust as it relates to governance, we tested the moderating role of trust as
well. We introduced an interaction term of trust
and asset specificity in a model of quasiintegration which included the main effects terms,
and found the coefficient of the interaction term
moderately significant ( p < 0.1). The coefficient
was again positively signed, suggesting that higher
levels of trust interact with asset specificity to
increase the extent of hierarchical governance.
However, from a sociological perspective, the
results are supportive of extant work and
intuition; simply that higher levels of trust are
found in closer relationships.
The role of trust is more salient in the process
manifestation of governance, for the addition of
a relational factor is instrumental in increasing
the extent of variance explained in joint action.
The presence of trust as an explanatory factor
for the structural manifestation of governance,
quasi-integration, may therefore be due to
reputation and other effects that may be present
at the time of the formation of the relationship.
While temporal effects may partly explain the
positive relationship of trust with both the process
and structural aspects of governance, further
research is needed to explicate the particular role
of this construct in transaction cost explanations of
interfirm relationships. The influence of trust
deriving from embedded personal relationships

in interfirm dyads also merits closer research
attention.
Governance structure and process
Our research makes a modest contribution
to the organizational economics literature by
offering operationalizations of both a structural
view (quasi-integration) and a process view
(joint action) of governance, and in empirically
investigating, however preliminarily, the phenomenon of relational governance and the role of
trust in interfirm exchange. Our contention is
that conceptualizations of governance, especially
pertaining to interfirm relationships, should
extend beyond the traditional structural aspects
to begin including the processual elements, often
key to understanding such relationships and
indeed, a good deal of organizational and
interorganizational behavior (Marrett, 1971).
Our results suggest that merely adopting an
appropriate governance structure may not lead to
the required process outcomes of governance, for
the governance structure explained only a small
amount of variance in governance process. A
dynamic view of the role of trust in relational
governance asserts that recurrent transactions may
provide a context for the development of trust over
time (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992), contributing to
the observed strong relationship between trust and
governance process. In turn, this may stimulate the
development of process safeguards for transactionspecific assets, such as standard operating procedures and other mechanisms that favor stable,
long-term, relational governance relationships. In
this vein, Heide and Miner (1992) demonstrated
the value of process elements in interorganizational
relationships and called for research using multiple
theories. However, they do not specifically demonstrate results from both structural and process
theories.
Multiple perspectives in interorganizational
research
This research has been motivated by a desire to
integrate economic and noneconomic perspectives
to understand a hybrid form of interorganizational
strategy, namely relational governance. This
integration is important as the two sets of
theoretical arguments may together provide
complementary insights into this theoretically

Directions for future research

Several future research directions seem promising. From the perspective of research design, a
useful advance would be to obtain information
on interorganizational constructs from both sides
of the interfirm dyad. This will enable crossvalidation of inherently relationship-oriented constructs like trust, and permit more valid measures
of constructs which relate to the other party,
such as reciprocal investments. Further, obtaining
data from both sides of the dyad would also
permit the modeling of differing perceptions on
the same phenomena. Other design possibilities
include the use of multiple respondents to
improve the validity of organization-level constructs, particularly if larger firms are included
in the sample (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper integrated economic and sociological
perspectives to explain the determinants of
relational governance. Our empirical results
support the assertions by Macneil (1980), Granovetter (1985) and others that there exists a
significant social component in exchange relationships which may be masked or missed in economic
explanations of exchange. The two combined
perspectives explained a significantly greater
proportion of the variance in the structural
manifestation of intermediate forms of interorganizational relationships. Further, the structural dimension by itself was inadequate in
explaining the processual aspects of relational
governance. The addition of the sociological
perspective, captured in the trust construct,

significantly enhanced the explanatory power of
the model of governance process.
