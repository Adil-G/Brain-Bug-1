Making
the
Role

Management Decisions:
and
of
Intuition
Emotion
By Herbert A. Simon
Carnegie-Mellon University

The

workof a managerincludesmakingdecisions

Intuition and Judgment

(or participating in their making), communicating
them to others, and monitoring how they are carried
out. Managersmust know a great deal about the industry and social environment in which they work and the
decision-making process itself to make decisions well.
Over the past 40 years, the technique of decision making has been greatly advanced by the development of a
wide range of tools-in particular, the tools of operations research and management science, and the technology of expert systems.
But these advances have not applied to the entire
domain of decision making. They have had their greatest impact on decision making that is well-structured,
deliberative, and quantitative; they have had less impact on decision making that is loosely structured, intuitive, and qualitative; and they have had the least
impact on face-to-face interactions between a manager
and his or her coworkers-the give and take of everyday work.
In this article, I will discuss these two relatively
neglected types of decision making:"intuitive"decision
making and decision making that involves interpersonal interaction. What, if anything, do we know about
how judgmental and intuitive processes work and how
they can be made to work better? And why do managers often fail to do what they know they should
do-even what they have decided to do? What can be
done to bring action into closer accord with intention?
My article will therefore have the form of a diptych, with one half devoted to each of these topics.
First, I will discuss judgmental and intuitive decision
making;then I will turn to the subject of the manager's
behavior and the influence of emotions on that
behavior.
Sometimes the term rational (or logical) is applied to decision making that is consciously analytic,
the term nonrational to decision making that is intuitive and judgmental, and the term irrational to decision making and behavior that responds to the emotions or that deviates from action chosen "rationally."
We will be concerned, then, with the nonrational and
the irrationalcomponents of managerialdecision making and behavior. Our task, you might say, is to discover the reason that underlies unreason.

As an appendix to the Functions of the Executive
(Harvard University Press, 1938), Chester I. Barnard
published an essay, based on a talk he had given in
1936 at Princeton, entitled "Mind in Everyday Affairs." 1 The central motif of that essay was a contrast
between what Barnard called "logical" and "nonlogical" processes for making decisions. He speaks of "the
wide divergence of opinion ... as to what constitutes a
proper intellectual basis for opinion or deliberate action." And he continues:

By "logical processes" I mean conscious
thinking which could be expressed in words
or by other symbols, that is, reasoning. By
"non-logical processes" I mean those not capable of being expressed in words or as reasoning, which are only made known by a
judgment, decision or action.
Barnard's thesis was that executives, as contrasted,
say, with scientists, do not often enjoy the luxury of
making their decisions on the basis of orderly rational
analysis, but depend largely on intuitive or judgmental
responses to decision-demandingsituations.
Although Barnard did not provide a set of formal
criteria for distinguishing between logical and judgmental decision making, he did provide a phenomenological characterization of the two styles that make
them easily recognizable,at least in their more extreme
forms. In logical decision making, goals and alternatives are made explicit, the consequences of pursuing
different alternatives are calculated, and these consequences are evaluated in terms of how close they are to
the goals.
In judgmental decision making, the response to
the need for a decision is usually rapid, too rapid to
allow for an orderly sequential analysis of the situation,
and the decision maker cannot usually give a veridical
account of either the process by which the decision was
reached or the grounds for judging it correct. Never-

theless, decision makers may have great confidence in
the correctness of their intuitive decisions and are
likely to attribute their ability to make them rapidly to
their experience.
Most executives probably find Barnard'saccount
of their decision processes persuasive;it captures their
own feelings of how processes work. On the other hand,
some students of management, especially those whose
goal is to improve management-decision processes,
have felt less comfortable with it. It appears to vindicate snap judgments and to cast doubt on the relevance of management-science tools, which almost all
involve deliberation and calculation in decision
making.
Barnard did not regard the nonlogical processes
of decision as magical in any sense. On the contrary,he
felt they were grounded in knowledge and experience:

rational and intuitive processes are so different that
they are carried out in different parts of the brain.

Split Brainm and Forms of Thought
Physiological research on "split brains"-brains
in which the corpus callosum, which connects the two
hemispheres of the cerebrum, has been severed-has
provided encouragement to the idea of two qualitatively different kinds of decision making-the analytical, correspondingto Barnard's"logical,"and the intuitive or creative, corresponding to his "non-logical."
The primary evidence behind this dichotomy is that
the two hemispheres exhibit a division of labor: in
right-handedpeople, the right hemisphere plays a special role in the recognition of visual patterns, and the
left hemisphere in analytical processes and the use of
language.
Other evidence in addition to the split-brain research suggests some measure of hemispheric specialization. Electrical activity in the intact brain can be
measured by EEG techniques. Activity in a brain
hemisphere is generally associated with partial or total
suppression in the hemisphere of the alpha system, a
salient brain wave with a frequencyof about ten vibrations per second. When a hemisphere is inactive, the
alpha rhythm in that hemisphere becomes strong. For
most right-handedsubjects, when the brain is engaged
in a task involving recognitionof visual pattern, the alpha rhythm is relatively strongerin the left than in the
right hemisphere;with more analytical tasks, the alpha
rhythm is relatively stronger in the right hemisphere.
(See Doktor and Hamilton, 1973, and Doktor, 1975, for
some experiments and a review of the evidence.3)
The more romantic versions of the split-brain
doctrine extrapolate this evidence into the two polar
forms of thought labeled above as analytical and creative. As an easy next step, evaluative nuances creep
into the discussion. The opposite of "creative," after
all, is "pedestrian."The analytical left hemisphere, so
this story goes, carrieson the humdrum,practical,everyday work of the brain, while the creative right hemisphere is responsible for those flights of imagination
that produce great music, great literature, great art,
great science, and great management.The evidence for
this romantic extrapolation does not derive from the
physiological research. As I indicated above, that research has provided evidence only for some measure of
specialization between the hemispheres. It does not in
any way imply that either hemisphere (especially the
right hemisphere) is capable of problem solving, decision making, or discovery independent of the other.
The real evidence for two different forms of thought is
essentially that on which Barnard relied: the observation that, in everyday affairs, men and women often
make competent judgments or reach reasonable decisions rapidly-without evidence indicating that they
have engaged in systematic reasoning, and without
their being able to report the thought processes that

The sources of these non-logical processes lie
in physiological conditions or factors, or in
the physical and social environment, mostly
impressed upon us unconsciously or without
conscious effort on our part. They also consist of the mass of facts, patterns, concepts,
techniques, abstractions, and generally what
we call formal knowledge or beliefs, which
are impressed upon our minds more or less
by conscious effort and study. This second
source of non-logical mental processes
greatly increases with directed experience,
study and education. (p.302)
At the time I wrote Administrative Behavior
(1941-42), I was troubled by Barnard'saccount of intuitive judgment (see the footnote on p. 51 of AB),
largely, I think, because he left no clues as to what subconscious processes go on while judgments are being
made. 2 I was wholly persuaded,however,that a theory
of decision making had to give an account of both conscious and subconsciousprocesses (see the end of p. 75
to the top of p. 76). I finessed the issue by assuming
that both the conscious and the unconscious parts of
the process were the same, that they involve drawing
on factual premises and value premises, and operating
on them to form conclusions that became the decisions.
Because I used logic (drawing conclusions from
premises) as a central metaphor to describe the decision-making process, many readers of Administrative
Behavior have concluded that the theory advanced
there applies only to "logical " decision making, not to
decisions that involve intuition and judgment. That
was certainly not my intent. But now, after nearly 50
years, the ambiguity can be resolved because we have
acquired a solid understandingof what the judgmental
and intuitive processes are. I will take up the new evidence in a moment; but first, a word must be said
about the "two brains" hypothesis, which argues that

took them to their conclusion.

58

<-----Page 3----->February, 1987

There is also some evidence for the very plausible
hypothesis that some people, confronted with a particular problem, make more use of intuitive processes in
solving it, while other people make relatively more use
of analytical processes (Doktor, 1978).'
For our purposes, it is the differences in behavior,
and not the differences in the hemispheres, that are
important. Reference to the two hemispheres is a red
herring that can only impede our understanding of intuitive, "non-logical" thought. The important questions for us are "What is intuition?" and "How is it
acccomplished?" not "In which cubic centimeters of
the brain tissue does it take place?"

Intuition in Chessplaying
One much studied class of experts is the
grandmastersin the game of chess. Chess is usually believed to require a high level of intellect, and
grandmasters are normally full-time professionals who
have devoted many years to acquiring their mastery of
the game. From a research standpoint, the advantage
of the game is that the level of skill of players can be
calibrated accurately from their official ratings, based
on their tournament success.
From the standpoint of studying intuitive thinking, chess might seem (at least to outsiders) an unpromising research domain. Chess playing is thought to
involve a highly analytical approach, with players
working out systematically the consequences of moves
and countermoves, so that a single move may take as
much as a half hour's thought, or more. On the other
hand, chess professionals can play simultaneous games,
sometimes against as many as 50 opponents, and exhibit only a moderately lower level of skill than in
games playing under tournament conditions. In simultaneous play, the professional takes much less than a
minute, often only a few seconds, for each move. There
is no time for careful analysis.
When we ask the grandmaster or master how he
or she is able to find good moves under these circumstances, we get the same answer that we get from other
professionals who are questioned about rapid decisions:
It is done by "intuition," by applying one's professional
"judgment"to the situation. A few seconds' glance at
the position suggests a good move, although the player
has no awareness of how the judgment was evoked.
Even under tournament conditions, good moves
usually come to a player's mind after only a few
seconds' consideration of the board. The remainder of
the analysis time is generally spent verifying that a
move appearing plausible does not have a hidden
weakness. We encounter this same kind of behavior in
other professional domains where intuitive judgments
are usually subjected to tests of various kinds before
they are actually implemented. The main exceptions
are situations where the decision has to be made before
a deadline or almost instantly. Of course we know that
under these circumstances (as in professional chess
when the allowed time is nearly exhausted), mistakes
are sometimes made.
How do we account for the judgment or intuition
that allows the chess grandmaster usually to find good
moves in a few seconds? A good deal of the answer can
be derived from an experiment that is easily repeated.
First, present a grandmasterand a novice with a position from an actual, but unfamiliar, chess game (with
about 25 pieces on the board). After five or ten
seconds, remove the board and pieces and ask the sub-

New Evidence on the Processes of
Intuition
In the 50 years since Barnard talked about the
mind in everyday affairs, we have learned a great deal
about the processes human beings use to solve
problems, to make decisions, and even to create works
of art and science. Some of this new knowledge has
been gained in the psychological laboratory;some has
been gained through observation of the behavior of
people who are demonstrably creative in some realm of
human endeavor; and a great deal has been gained
through the use of the modern digital computer to
model human thought processes and perform problemsolving and decision-making functions at expert levels.
I should like to examine this body of research,
which falls under the labels of "cognitive science" and
"artificialintelligence," to see what light it casts on intuitive, judgmental decision making in management.
We will see that a rather detailed account can be given
of the processes that underlie judgment, even though
most of these processes are not within the conscious
awareness of the actor using them.

The Expert's Intuition
In recent years, the disciplines of cognitive science and artificial intelligence have devoted a great
deal of attention to the nature of expert problem solving and decision making in professional-level tasks.
The goal of the cognitive science research has been to
gain an understanding of the differences between the
behavior of experts and novices, and possibly to learn
more about how novices can become experts. The goal
of the artificial intelligence research has been to build
computer systems that can perform professional tasks
as competently as human experts can. Both lines of research have greatly deepened our understanding of
expertise.4

59

jects to reproduce it. The grandmasterwill usually reconstruct the whole position correctly, and on average
will place 23 or 24 pieces on their correct squares. The
novice will only be able to replace, on average, about 6

computer instructions that take the form of "if-then"
pairs. The "if"'is a set of conditions or patterns to be
recognized;the "then" is a body of informationassociated with the "if' and evoked from memory whenever
the pattern is recognizedin the current situation.
Some of our best data about this organizationof
expert knowledgecome from the areas of medical diagnosis. Systems like CADUcEUs
and MYCINconsist of a
large number of such if-then pairs, together with an inference machine of modest powers. These systems are
capable of medical diagnosis at a competent clinical
level within their respective limited domains. Their
recognition capabilities, the if-then pairs, represent
their intuitive or judgmental ability; their inferencing
powers represent their analytical ability.
Medical diagnosis is just one of a number of domains for which expert systems have been built. For
many years, electric motors, generators,and transformers have been designed by expert systems developed by
large electrical manufacturers. These computer programs have taken over from professional engineers
many standards and relatively routine design tasks.
They imitate fairly closely the rule-of-thumb procedures that human designers have used, the result of a
large stock of theoretical and practical information
about electrical machinery. Recognition also plays a
large role in these systems. For example, examination
of the customer'sspecifications"reminds"the program
of a particular class of devices, which is then used as
the basis for the design. Parametersfor the design are
then selected to meet the performancerequirementsof
the device.
In chemistry, reaction paths for synthesizing organic molecules can be designed by expert systems. In
these systems, the process appears relatively analytic,
for it is guided by reasoningin the form of means-ends
analyses, which work backwardfrom the desired molecule, via a sequence of reactions, to available raw
materials.But the reasoningscheme depends on a large
store of knowledgeof chemical reactions and the ability of the system to recognizerapidly that a particular
substance can be obtained as the output of one or more
familiar reactions. Thus, these chemical synthesis programs employ the same kind of mixture of intuition
and analysis that is used in the other expert systems,
and by human experts as well.
Other examples of expert systems can be cited,
and all of them exhibit reasoningor analytic processes
combined with processes for accessing knowledge
banks with the help of recognition cues. This appears
to be a universal scheme for the organizationof expert
systems-and of expert human problemsolving as well.
Notice that there is nothing "irrational"about intuitive or judgmental reasoning based on productions.
The conditions in a production constitute a set of
premises. Whenever these conditions are satisfied, the
production draws the appropriate conclusion-it
evokes from memoryinformationimplied by these conditions or even initiates motor responses. A person
learning to drive a car may notice a red light, be aware
that a red light calls for a stop, and be awarethat stop-

pieces.

It might seem that we are witnessing remarkable
skill in visual imagery and visual memory, but we can
easily dismiss that possibility by carryingout a second
experiment. The conditions are exactly the same as in
the first experiment, except that now the 25 pieces are
placed on the board at random. The novice can still
replace about 6 pieces and the grandmaster-about 6!
The difference between them in the first experiment
does not lie in the grandmaster'seyes or imagery, but
in his knowledge, acquired by long experience, of the
kinds of patterns and clusters of pieces that occur on
chessboards in the course of games. For the expert,
such a chess board is not an arrangementof 25 pieces
but an arrangementof a half dozen familiar patterns,
recognizable old friends. On the random board there
are no such patterns, only the 25 individual pieces in
an unfamiliar arrangement.
The grandmaster'smemory holds more than a set
of patterns. Associated with each pattern in his or her
memory is information about the significance of that
pattern-what dangers it holds, and what offensive or
defensive 'moves it suggests. Recognizing the pattern
brings to the grandmaster'smind at once moves that
may be appropriateto the situation. It is this recognition that enables the professional to play very strong
chess at a rapid rate. Previous learning that has stored
the patterns and the information associated with them
in memory makes this performance possible. This,
then, is the secret of the grandmaster's intuition or
judgment.
Estimates have been made, in a variety of ways,
of the number of familiarpatterns (which psychologists
now call chunks) that the master or grandmastermust
be able to recognize. These estimates fall in the neighborhood of 50,000, give or take a factor of two. Is this a
large number? Perhaps not. The natural language vocabularies of college graduates have been estimated to
be in the range of 50,000 to 200,000 words, nearly the
same range as the chess expert's vocabularies of patterns of pieces. Moreover, when we recognize a word,
we also get access to information in our memories
about the meaning of the word and to other information associated with it as well. So our ability to speak
and understand language has the same intuitive or
judgmental flavor as the grandmaster'sability to play
chess rapidly.

Intuition in Computerized Expert
Systems
A growing body of evidence from artificial intelligence research indicates that expert computer systems,
capable of matching human performancein some limited domain, can be built by storing in computer memory tens of thousands of productions. Productions are
60

<-----Page 5----->February, 1987

in a coherent way and they must be supplied with reasoning capabilities that allow inferences to be drawn
from the information retrieved, and numerous chunks
of informationto be combined. Hence intuition is not a
process that operates independently of analysis; rather,
the two processes are essential complementarycomponents of effective decision-making systems. When the
expert is solving a difficult problem or making a complex decision, much conscious deliberation may be involved. But each conscious step may itself constitute a
considerableleap, with a whole sequence of automated
productions building the bridge from the premises to
the conclusions.Hence the expert appears to take giant
intuitive steps in reasoning, as compared with the tiny
steps of the novice.
It is doubtful that we will find two types of man-

ping requires applying the brakes. For an experienced
driver, the sight of the red light simply evokes the application of brakes. How conscious the actor is of the
process inversely, how automatic the response is, may
differ, but there is no difference in the logic being
applied.

Intuition in Management
Some direct evidence also suggests that the intuitive skills of managers depend on the same kinds of
mechanisms as the intuitive skills of chessmasters or
physicians. It would be surprising if it were otherwise.
The experienced manager, too, has in his or her memory a large amount of knowledge, gained from training
and experience and organized in terms of recognizable
chunks and associated information.
Marius J. Bouwman has constructed a computer
programcapable of detecting company problems from
an examination of accounting statements." The program was modeled on detailed thinking-aloudprotocols
of experienced financial analysts interpreting such
statements, and it captures the knowledgethat enables
analysts to spot problems intuitively, usually at a very

agers (at least, of good managers), one of whom relies

almost exclusively on intuition, the other on analytic
techniques. More likely, we will find a continuum of
decision-makingstyles involving an intimate combination of the two kinds.of skill. We will likely also find
that the nature of the problem to be solved will be a
principal determinant of the mix.
With our growing understanding of the organization of judgmental and intuitive processes, of the specific knowledge that is required to perform particular
judgmental tasks, and of the cues that evoke such
knowledgein situations in which it is relevant, we have
a powerful new tool for improving expert judgment.
We can specify the knowledge and the recognition capabilities that experts in a domain need to acquire as a
basis for designing appropriate learning procedures.
We can also, in more and more situations, design
expert systems capable of automating the expertise, or
alternatively, of providing the human decision maker
with an expert consultant. Increasingly,we will see decision aids for managersthat will be highly interactive,
with both knowledge and intelligence being shared between the human and the automated components of
the system.
A vast research and development task of extracting and cataloging the knowledge and cues used
by experts in different kinds of managerial tasks lies
ahead. Much has been learned in the past few years
about how to do this. More needs to be learned about
how to update and improve the knowledge sources of
expert systems as new knowledge becomes available.
Progress will be most rapid with expert systems
that have a substantial technical component. It is no
accident that the earliest expert systems were built for
such tasks as designing motors, making medical diagnoses, playing chess, and finding chemical synthesis
paths. In the area of management,the analysis of company financial statements is a domain where some progress has been made in constructing expert systems.
The areas of corporatepolicy and strategy are excellent
candidates for early development of such systems.
What about the aspects of executive work that involve the managing of people? What help can we expect in improving this crucial component of the management task?

rapid rate. When a comparison is made between the re-

sponses of the programand the responses of an expert
human financial analyst, a close match is usually
found.

In another study, R. Bhaskar gathered thinkingaloud protocols from business school students and experienced businessmen,who were all asked to analyze a
business policy case.' The final analyses produced by
the students and the businessmen were quite similar.
What most sharply discriminated between the novices
and the experts was the time required to identify the
key features of the case. This was done very rapidly,
with the usual appearancesof intuition, by the experts;
it was done slowly, with much conscious and explicit
analysis, by the novices.
These two pieces of research are just drops of
water in a large bucket that needs filling. The description, in detail, of the use of judgmental and analytical
processes in expert problem solving and decision making deserves a high priority in the agenda of management research.

Can Judgment Be Improved?
From this and other research on expert problem
solving and decision making, we can draw two main
conclusions.First, experts often arrive at problem diagnoses and solutions rapidly and intuitively without being able to report how they attained the result. Second,
this ability is best explained by postulating a recognition and retrieval process that employs a large number-generally tens of thousands or even hundreds of
thousands-of chunks or patterns stored in long term
memory.
When the problems to be solved are more than
trivial, the recognition processes have to be organized
61

<-----Page 6----->Academy of Management EXECUTIVE

rary personal comfort at the expense of bad long-run
consequences for the organization.
Behavior of this kind is "intuitive" in the sense
that it represents response without careful analysis and
calculation. Lying, for example, is much more often the
result of panic than of Machiavellian scheming. The intuition of the emotion-driven manager is very different
from the intuition of the expert whom we discussed
earlier. The latter's behavior is the product of learning
and experience, and is largely adaptive; the former's
behavior is a response to more primitive urges, and is
more often than not inappropriate. We must not confuse the "nonrational" decisions of the experts-the
decisions that derive from expert intuition and judgment-with the irrational decisions that stressful emotions may produce.
I have made no attempt here to produce a comprehensive taxonomy of the pathologies of organizational decision making, but simply have given some examples of the ways that stress interacts with cognition
to elicit counterproductive behavior. Such responses
can become so habitual for individuals or even for organizations that they represent a recognizable managerial "style."
Organizational psychologists have a great deal to
say about ways of motivating workers and executives to
direct their efforts toward organizational goals. They
have said less about ways of molding habits so that executives can handle situations in a goal-directed manner. When it comes to handling situations, two dimensions of behavior deserve particular attention: the
response to problems that arise, and the initiation of
activity that looks to the future.

Knowledge and Behavior
What managers know they should do-whether
by analysis or intuitively-is very often different from
what they actually do. A common failure of managers,
which all of us have observed, is the postponement of
difficult decisions. What is it that makes decisions difficult and hence tends to cause postponement? Often,
the problem is that all of the alternatives have undesired consequences. When people have to choose the
lesser of two evils, they do not simply behave like
Bayesian statisticians, weighing the bad against the
worse in the light of their respective possibilities. Instead, they avoid the decision, searching for alternatives that do not have negative outcomes. If such alternatives are not available, they are likely to continue to
postpone making a choice. A choice between undesirables is a dilemma, something to be avoided or
evaded.
Often, uncertainty is the source of the difficulty.
Each choice may have a good outcome under one set of
environmentalcontingencies, but a bad outcome under
another. When this occurs, we also do not usually observe Bayesian behavior;the situation is again treated
as a dilemma.
The bad consequences of a manager'sdecision are
often bad for other people. Managers sometimes have
to dismiss employees or, even more frequently, have to
speak to them about unsatisfactory work. Dealing with
such matters face to face is stressful to many, perhaps
most, executives. The stress is magnified if the employee is a close associate or friend. If the unpleasant
task cannot be delegated, it may be postponed.
The manager who has made a mistake (that is to
say, all of us at one time or another) also finds himself
or herself in a stressful situation. The matter must be
dealt with sooner or later, but why not later instead of
sooner? Moreover, when it is addressed, it can be approached in different ways. A manager may try to
avoid blame-"It wasn't my fault!" A different way is
to propose a remedy to the situation. I know of no systematic data on how often the one or the other course
is taken, but most of us could probably agree that
blame-avoiding behavior is far more common than
problem-solvingbehavior after a serious error has been
made.

The Consequences

Responding to Problems
The response of an organization to a problem or
difficulty, whether it results from a mistake or some
other cause, is generally one that looks both backward
and forward. It looks backward to establish responsibility for the difficulty and to diagnose it, and forward
to find a course of action to deal with it.
The backward look is an essential part of the organization's reward system. The actions that have led
to difficulties, and the people responsible for those actions, need to be identified. But the backward look can
also be a source of serious pathologies. Anticipation of
it-particularly anticipation that it will be acted on in
a punitive way-is a major cause for tne concealment
of problems until they can no longer be hidden. It can
also be highly divisive, as individuals point fingers to
transfer blame to others. Such outcomes can hardly be
eliminated, but an organization's internal reputation
for fairness and objectivity can mitigate them. So can a
practice of subordinating the blame finding to a diagnosis of causes as a first step toward remedial action.
Most important of all, however, is the forward
look: the process of defining the problem and identifying courses of action that may solve it. Here also the
reward system is critically important. Readiness to

of Stress

What all of these decision-makingsituations have
in common is stress, a powerful force that can divert
behavior from the urgings of reason. They are examples of a much broader class of situations in which
managers frequently behave in clearly nonproductive
ways. Nonproductive responses are especially common
when actions have to be made under time pressure.
The need to allay feelings of guilt, anxiety, and embarrassment may lead to behavior that produces tempo62

<-----Page 7----->February, 1987

Looking to the Future

search for problem situations and effectiveness in finding them need to be recognized and rewarded.
Perhaps the greatest influence a manager can
have on the problem-solvingstyle of the organization
as a role model is making the best responses to
problems. The style the manager should aim for rests
on the following principles:
1. Solving the problem takes priority over looking
backwardto its causes. Initially, backwardlooks should
be limited to diagnosingcauses;fixing responsibilityfor
mistakes should be postponed until a solution is being
implemented.
2. The manager accepts personal responsibility
for finding and proposing solutions instead of seeking
to shift that responsibility either to superiorsor to subordinates, although the search for solutions may, of
course, be a collaborativeeffort involving many people.
3. The manager accepts personal responsibility
for implementing action solutions, including securing
the necessary authority from above if required.
4. When it is time to look backward,fixing blame
may be an essential part of the process, but the primary focus of attention should be on what can be
learned to prevent similar problems from arising in the
future.
These principles are as obvious as the Ten Commandments and perhaps not quite as difficult to obey.
Earlier, I indicated that stress might cause departures
from them, but failure to respond effectively to
problems probably derives more from a lack of attention and an earlier failure to cultivate the appropriate
habits. The military makes much use of a procedure
called "Estimate of the Situation." Its value is not that
it teaches anything esoteric, but that through continual
training in its use, commanders become habituated to
approaching situations in orderly ways, using the
checklists provided by the formal procedure.
Habits of response to problems are taught and
learned both in the manager's one-on-one conversations with subordinatesand in staff meetings. Is attention brought back repeatedly to defining the problems
until everyone is agreed on just what the problem is? Is
attention then directed toward generating possible solutions and evaluating their consequences? The least
often challenged and most reliable base of managerial
influence is the power to set the agenda, to focus attention. It is one of the most effective tools the manager
has for training organization members to approach
problems constructively by shaping their own habits of
attention.
The perceptive reader will have discerned that
"shaping habits of attention" is identical to "acquiring
intuitions." The habit of responding to problems by
looking for solutions can and must become intuitive-cued by the presence of the problem itself. A
problem-solvingstyle is a component of the set of intuitions that the manager acquires, one of the key components of effective managerialbehavior.

With respect to the initiation of activity, the organizational habit we would like to instil is responsiveness to cues that signal future difficulties as well as to
those that call attention to the problems of the moment. Failure to give sufficient attention to the future
most often stems from two causes. The first is interruption by current problems that have more proximate
deadlines and hence seem more urgent; the second is
the absence of sufficient "scanning" activity that can
pick up cues from the environmentthat long-runforces
not impinging immediately on the organization have
importance for it in the future.
In neither case is the need for sensitivity to the
future likely to be met simply by strengthening intuitions. Rather, what is called for is deliberate and systematic allocation of organizational resources to deal
with long-rangeproblems, access for these resourcesto
appropriate input from the environment that will attract their attention to new prospects, and protection
of these planning resources from absorption in current

problems, however urgent they may be. Attention to
the future must be institutionalized;there is no simpler
way to incorporate it into managerial"style" or habit.
It is a fallacy to contrast "analytic" and "intuitive" styles of management. Intuition and judgment-at least good judgment-are simply analyses
frozen into habit and into the capacity for rapid response through recognition.Every managerneeds to be
able to analyze problems systematically (and with the
aid of the modern arsenal of analytical tools provided
by management science and operations research).
Every managerneeds also to be able to respond to situations rapidly, a skill that requires the cultivation of
intuition and judgment over many years of experience
and training. The effective manager does not have the
luxury of choosing between "analytic" and "intuitive"
approaches to problems. Behaving like a manager
means having command of the whole range of management skills and applying them as they become appropriate. U
