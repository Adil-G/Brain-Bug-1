US university-sponsored technology
incubators: an overview of
management, policies and
performance

Abstract
Despite the increased worldwide interest in the university-sponsored technology incubator
(USTI) as a mechanism for supporting the development of new technology-based firms (NTBFs),
there is a dearth of empirical evidence on determinants of their best organization and management,
and policy practices. This paper presents results from a national survey of more than 30 fiveyear and older American USTIs.
The study focused on a sample comprising three state university-sponsored and three private
university-sponsored facilities, generally viewed as being successful. The USTI practices and
performance are explored using several key dimensions: organizational design, tenant performance
review, funding sources, targeted technologies, strategic operational policies, services and their
value-added component, and growth of the client firms.
A comparative review of these dimensions reveals that there are no significant differences
based on the type of sponsorship - state or private. It is concluded that, given the fuller
utilization of university resources by the application of sound policies and business-management
practices, the USTIs appear to provide an environment conducive to the development of NTBFs.
Finally, it is recommended that universities must build their technology incubator programs by
setting reasonable objectives and management policies that will encourage tangible results
consistent with the new mission requirements of an entrepreneurial university.

Introduction

Historically, the mission of US universities has
been education, research, and public service.
However, during the past more than two decades
there has been an emerging trend on the part of
some entrepreneurial universities toward a more
direct involvement in supporting new business

development
activities. This proactive role is
generally motivated by their desire to participate
in regional economic development efforts and, at
the same time, encourage the commercialization
of the university’s own research [l].
One mechanism used for this purpose is the
establishment of business incubators in or around
the university campuses. By 1992, more than fifty

American universities and four-year colleges had
participated in this effort [2], thus redefining their
missions to better serve the economic development
needs of their respective constituencies.
This
industry has been growing at a steady rate since
the early 1980s (see Fig. 1). Despite the growth
in the number of USTIs, there is a paucity
of information on their working and related
performance [3, 41.
This article provides a preliminary review of
university-sponsored
incubators in the US by
exploring their organization
and management,
policy, and performance dimensions. The study is
based on six cases of USTIs, representing
a
population of 30 five-year and older facilities. The
various USTI policy and management dimensions
explored include their origins and objectives, organizational design, governance and policy guidance,
tenant performance review procedures, funding
sources, targeted technologies, tenant entrepreneurs’

1991 and updated in late 1993.

knowledge

and study

With the popularity of the business incubation
concept, numerous studies have been conducted
to assess the emerging incubator industry across
the nation [5-lo]. Most of these studies are
primarily descriptive, lacking conceptual and/or
methodological grounding. Only a handful of these
studies [8, lo] were comprehensive enough to
mention the role of universities in providing
business incubation support. However, none of
these studies specifically focused on the universitysponsored technology incubators, generally understood to provide a resource base necessary for the
development of NTBFs.
From the incubation business literature reviewed
[3] it is clear that most of the incubator-related
knowledge does not have a sound theoretical base
of its own and is, by and large, anecdotal in
nature. Hence, our understanding of the business
incubation function in general and the universitysponsored
business
incubation
support
for
developing new technology-based firms in particular remains fairly rudimentary. Consequently, there
is no consensus on what makes up the content of
successful policies and management practices in
the area of business incubation and how to improve
the performance [6, 7, 91. This is even more true
in the case of USTIs [3].
The USTIs’ salient policy and business-management practices in four key functional areas
(management, marketing, finance and operations)
form the basis of various dimensions explored in
this study. These dimensions are derived from
parallel but separate incubator studies reported in
the literature, and are described below [3, 121.

Origins of facilities - to understand the USTI
contextual settings, their origins, growth in physical facilities and other resources are assessed.

Objectives - beyond the common objective of
participation in the economic development,
facilities
objectives
differently,
articulate
depending on their sponsors’ interests.
Organizationaf design - most USTIs are physically located on or near their respective sponsoring-university
campuses;
however,
their
organizational relationships with the university
differ. Additionally, the state and local community involvement has to be determined.
Governance and policy guidance - generally,
all USTI facilities are run by various types of
boards with varying degrees of university, state,
local government and private sector representations. These boards provide overall direction.
Tenant performance review - formal periodic
(annual, biannual and quarterly) and informal
tenant performance reviews are held at most of
the USTIs which are assessed.
Institutional support - various USTI programs
take advantage of their respective university
technology transfer programs, research centers,
and technology and business development assistance centers, such as SBDC and SBIR’ projects
which vary in their levels of activity.
Stufing - the facilities employ varying numbers
of administrative/clerical and professional staff
depending upon the size and nature of each
operation.
the funding parameters
Funding sources which are explored in the respective USTIs
include state funding and university support for
the USTI as well as funds to support the growth
of tenant firms.
Technologies targeted - the type of technology
targeted for development is generally a function
of the available resources at a particular facility.
Personal traits of tenant entrepreneurs - personal characteristics of tenant entrepreneurs
such as average age, education level and initial
financial contributions need to be explored.
Strategic operational policies - the key elements
of strategic considerations in operating a successful USTI facility include: tenant selection policy,
tenant graduation policy, intellectual property
safeguards for tenant firms, and graduate
firm-USTI linkages.

Services and their value-added - there are two
main categories of service: shared rental space,
including other typical shared incubator services;
and the university-related
services, including
faculty consultants and student employees. Tenant firms’ perceived value-added by these services also needs to be determined.
Survival and growth of tenant firms - impacts
on the survival and growth of tenant firms are
measured in terms of dropouts, annual sales
and employment growth.
This framework captures most of the key USTI
characteristics described in the literature and is
able to address the major aspects of the USTI
organizational, management and policy practices
employed
in supporting the development
of
NTBFs. The approach is systematic and is applicable to those USTIs which have a track record.
The following sections employ this framework in
analyzing selected cases.

Methodology

and sample

This study used a multiple-case design with an
embedded survey of the client firms and employed
a comparative evaluation approach [13, 141. For
data collection, on-site interviews were conducted
with the incubator managers and involved the
faculty, and these were supplemented by information obtained through mail surveys administered
to the client firms2 of the selected USTI cases
(the number of firms accessible for survey in each
case is reported in Section 4.1). Out of the total
of 150 client firms contacted, 47 responded to the
survey (a response rate of 31%). Additionally,
interviews were conducted with several incubator
experts to help refine the methodology and set
criteria for selecting the sample. The USTIs studied
were chosen to represent programs which:
were sponsored by a ‘major’ university in the
us;
represented both public and private university
types;
were generally viewed as successful or otherwise
unique;

significant findings.

Origins of facilities

The Technology Advancement Program (TAP)
at University of Maryland, College Park (a state
university) was established in September 1984.
TAP rents its 15 700 square feet (1460 m’) space
to a select group of 15 to 19 tenants at a rate of
$7.50 per square foot, which is about 30% less
than the market rate. TAP’s program growth and
facilities such as new buildings, number of staff,
additional services and new programs have been
moderate during the past six years. Accordingly,
it received an enhanced state grant, resulting in
increased operational budget and more clients
served. All of TAP’s current 15 tenants and 10
graduates were accessible for the client firm survey.
The Advanced Technology development Center
(ATDC) at Georgia Institute of Technology (a
state university) is the oldest of the six facilities
studied and was established in 1980. It rents 83 000

518

square feet (7700 m2) space at its main facility on
Georgia Tech campus, at a rate of $9.50 per
square foot, which is more than 30% cheaper than
the market rate. The ATDC program’s growth
has been substantial during the more than ten
years of its operation. This includes the addition
of two new branches, with additional personnel
and client firms, made possible by additional state
grants. According to the ATDC management, the
facility has 41 clients and 24 graduate firms;
however, only 20 tenants and 17 graduates were
made accessible and were included in the survey.
This may be explained by the fact that some
clients are not tenants, and a large number of
graduates were not accessible for various reasons.
The Ben Craig Center (BCC) at University of
North Carolina at Charlotte (a state university)
was established in March 1986. The BCC’s 87 000
square feet (8080 m’) rentable space at its newly
built facility is available at $10.50 per square foot,
which is slightly cheaper (O-15%) than the market
rate. Due to this recent growth in rentable space
the management has been soliciting tenants to fill
the empty space, at the same time trying to keep
to the entry policy guidelines (discussed in Section
4.11). All the 16 tenants and 3 out of 6 graduate
firms were included in the client firms’ survey.
The Technology Innovation Center (TIC) at
Northwestern
University (a private university)
started its operation in June 1986. TIC rents its
33000 square feet (3070 m2) of rentable space at
its new facility at a rate of $14.75 per square foot,
which is market competitive. TIC’s program growth
has been relatively high; for example, the recent
1990 expansion has more than doubled its physical
facilities and accordingly more services and new
programs have been added. All of the center’s 25
tenants and 6 graduate firms were included in the
client firm survey.
North East Tier of the Ben Franklin Technology
Center (BFIC) at Lehigh University (a private
university) was established in May 1983. The
center rents 21 900 square feet (2040 m2) of its
currently available space in four different buildings.
The rental rates vary from $5.00 to $15.00 per
square foot, depending upon the type of customer

<-----Page 5----->on the university campus. The rental rate varies
from $4.50 to $12.50 per square foot, depending
upon the type of customer and the quality of
space. Though the m~agement
believes that the
rents are better than the market, the client firm
respondents are split in their assessments with half
responding that there are no rental breaks and
the other half reporting rental breaks from 15 to
30%. The ED1 program’s growth in facilities and
new programs has been relatively slow to moderate
during the past six years of its history; therefore,
only a handful of select tenants have been served.
All of the 7 tenants and 4 graduates were included
in the client firm survey.
4.2.

Objectives

The objectives set forth by the above six USTIs
have a number of common features. Examination
of these objectives shows that participation in
economic development activities for supporting
the development of NTBFs was the overriding
common objective. Also, technology transfer and
commercialization
of university research were
another set of objectives which were commonly
articulated by most of the facilities. Providing a
laboratory for the development of entrepreneurial
skills among aspiring students and faculty was also
emphasized to a varying degree by all of the
six facilities studied. The other less commonly
mentioned objectives included: reaping long-term
financial benefits for the sponsoring university,
achieving economic self-reliance, capturing small
business development activity for the neighboring
research park, helping small businesses from various government funding programs, and supporting
the development of manufacturing firms.

4.3.

Organizational

design

All of the six facilities are somewhat different
in terms of their organizational design. Though
all are physically located on their respective
sponsoring-university campuses, the organizational
relationships with the university differ. There are
two main types of organizational design.

520

The first type is closely linked with the respective
university, which can include TAP, ATDC, and
initially TIC. The facility is either part of the
university’s particular school or department (as in
the case of TAP) or an inde~ndent
departmentlike entity (as in the case of ATDC, and previously
TIC). Therefore, these USTIs are virtually organizational components of their respective universities, for which the latter generally feel responsible.
They are maintained like a special program of
studies within the university which ensures the
flow of funds, predominantly obtained from the
respective states. Consequently, their dependence
on the sponsoring university is heavy, with resultant
direct influence on their policies. It is interesting
to note that both Unive~ity of balled
(TAP’s
sponsor) and Georgia Tech (ATDc’s sponsor) are
land-grant institutions3
The second type of USTI consists of stand-alone
non-profit entities such as BCC, BFTC, ED1 and
now TIC. They were established by the universities
but now rely on heavy private and local funds
provided by some of the major private sector
interests in their respective communities. An armslength relationship exists between these USTIs
and the university. The university does provide
necessary oversight and emergency linancial and
in-kind support, guaranteeing operational success.
4.4.

Governance

and policy guidance

A close comparison among the six facilities
revealed a heavy involvement of the private sector
with university representation at five out of the
six sites. Only ATDC had a national advisory
committee which provided broad policy guidance,
but this committee is no longer active. An alternate
to seeking this broad policy guidance was present
at BFTC in the form of a large n-member Ben
Franklin advisory board, comprising business and
community leaders from throughout the state.
Similar state-wide arrangements were found at
BCC, EDI .and TAP. TIC’s advisory oversight is
provided by the host city’s business community
with the help of the university management.
The involvement of area business leaders has

Techn6vation

Vol. 14 No. 8

<-----Page 6----->US university-sponsored

helped BFTC, TIC, ED1 and even BCC not only
by giving advice on policy but also by providing
substantial private funds. On the other hand,
although facihties such as TAP and ATDC were
able to involve the private sector in policy guidance,
they depended heavily on state funds.
4.5.

Tenant performance

review

Formal periodic (annual, biannual and quarterly)
reviews are held at TAP, ATDC, BCC and BTFC.
At TIC and EDI tenant reviews are informal, carried
out by the incubator manager or director on a oneto-one basis which includes indirect evaluations
made by obtaining feedback from other in-house
sources providing funds to the firms.
More formal tenant evaluation
procedures
helped the management at TAP, ATDC and
BFTC keep a sense of purpose for their facilities
as well as the client firms. The less formal
evaluations at TIC, BCC and ED1 kept the
clients’ attention away from striving for short-term
financial gains. In general, the tenant evaluations
provided the necessary expert feedback
for
improved performance.
4.6.

Institutional

support

AI1 six programs take advantage of their respective university technology transfer programs, technology and business development assistance centers, and the SBIR projects which vary in their
levels of activity.
Two of the land-grant institutions, University of
Maryland and Georgia Tech,. have technology/
industrial extension services which provide the
necessary technology transfer environments. Both
Georgia Tech and Northwestern University have
established industrial research institutes and industrial research laboratories for contractual applied
research purposes. As for certain specialized areas,
Northwestern
University
and Case Western
Reserve University both have biotechnology centers/institutes. Georgia Tech has an Information
Technology Center. Only BCC at University
of North Carolina at Charlotte has a focused

Staffing

ATDC has the most extensive staffing, with two
officers, three professionals,
and seven others
including administrative assistants and workers.
Second to this is BCC with one officer, four
professionals and three other administrative assistance staff. The remaining four USTIs (TAP, TIC,
BFIC and EDI) have leaner staffs consisting of a
manager/director,
program coordinator/administrative assistant, and one or two secretaries. When
compared in terms of the number of tenants in
each facility, TIC and BFTC have more tenants
per staff than the other USTIs.
4.6.

Funding

sources

All six programs studied have benefitted from
state grants in one form or another. TAP draws
about half of its operational budget from the state;
ATDC has even more dependence on state dollars;
both appear in the form of a line-item in the
university budget. Both BCC and TIC have
received lump-sum state grants on different
occasions. In the cases of BFTC and EDI, states
helped to maintain these non-profit entities, with
major shares coming from the local private sector,
and with participation (generally, in the form of
in-kind support) from the host university. In terms
of the university’s financial help, with the exception
of ATDC and TAP (which were set up by the
state funds) all the other facilities have received
some kind of initial university funding and/or inkind support in the form of staff salaries, buildings,
and their maintenance and utilities. However,
aside from TAP and to some extent ATDC,
the remaining four have evolved arms-length
relationships with the sponsoring universities.
These
relationships
also influenced
funding
decisions in the sense that they became less
dependent on direct university support.
All the six facilities helped their tenants in
seeking funds from public and private sources.

521

<-----Page 7----->S.A. Mian

Providing information and professional help in
competing for SBIR grants was common. Private
venture capital and seed financing support were
also available, but with varying degrees of ease;
for example, ATDC with its Georgia Capital
Network, TIC with Evanston Business Investment
Corp., BFIC from Ben Franklin Program, and
EDI with several local private venture capital
funds, were prominent. BCC and TAP are in
the process of developing more elaborate client
financing arrangements through their facilities.

instrumentation tirrns which were the dominant
clients (in numbers). A total inventory of the
client firms surveyed in all six facilities is ranked

elements, stated by four out of six facilities, are,
respectively, element 3 (the presence of a strategic
business plan) and element 5 (commercializable
product/process/service).
Graduation policy: similarly, tenant graduation
(or exit) policies were spelt out in all the six cases,
with or without a predetermined incubation period.
A period of three years seemed to be the
norm, while, practically, it had been kept flexible
(depending upon the need) in all the facilities
studied. At BCC and BFTC, the incubation period
was negotiated and/or planned with client firms at
the time of entry. BCC raised the rent (at the
rate of $Usquare foot per year) after this agreed-

upon period was expired. At EDI, an extension
beyond two years required approval by a special
committee. ATDC had an elaborate exit criterion
in terms of levels of achievement in one or more
of the following: sales and employees, space need,
acquisition by a larger corporation,
three to
four products, venture capital obtained, and selfsufficiency in professional services.
Client firms suggested two to five years of
flexible incubation periods; also suggested were a
few proposals of tying the incubation period to
the growth and space needs of the client firm.
Intellectual property safeguards:
intellectual
property safeguards for the client firms are generally available in the form of an unspoken trust
between the incubator management
and their
client firms. At ATDC, incubator management is
willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement on
demand. At BFIC the Incubator Manager has
signed an agreement with its management, at the
time of accepting the job, for protecting clients’
proprietary information.
Most of the responding clients expressed no
concern about any violation of their intellectual
property rights at the hands of the incubator
management. Therefore, they did not express a
need for any formal written policy.
Equity or royalty policies: these policies varied
considerably from facility to facility. Generally,
the states discourage holding equity and use their
grant money as leverage. Royalties are not held
by any of the facilities included in the study;
however, those using university technology or
incubator-sponsored financial grants could obtain
professional help to work out such deals. At EDI,
a long-term success fee was included in only one
case but was not made a common practice.
Similarly, at TAP, equity of up to 5% was held
in a few client firms.
Graduate firm-USTI linkages: linkages between
graduate firms and USTIs have not been given
much attention, and no formal policies had been
developed in this regard. The graduate firms were
generally encouraged by the USTIs to stay in
contact. Often, they enjoyed the use of certain
facilities on an ‘as available’ basis, and in some

a service fee was also charged. The graduates
were expected to pay back in the form of some
help through involvement with the new client firms.
Facilities such as BCC and TIC, which are close
to or part of the university-affiliated
research
parks, allowed their tenants to move on to the
parks and keep using most of the services. On the
other hand, facilities such as ED1 which did not
possess such an arrangement felt the need to build
a research park. No such need was explicity
mentioned at BFTC, ATDC and TAP. However,
some clients at TAP expressed a desire to stay
close to the facility and continue using the services
even after graduating.

Services and their value-added

The typical incubator services such as shared
rental space, shared office services, business asistante, inside and outside networking, etc., were
provided by all of the six facilities. Business assistance
services were available but with varying arrangements. At ATDC, business and management consulting was provided by in-house consultants, while
at BCC, TIC, BFIC and ED1 the services were
available through resident private firms. No such
formal arrangement was reported at TAP, where
the incubator director/manager and staff themselves
seemed to have assisted tenant entrepreneurs in
their business and management problems.

<-----Page 9----->S.A. Mian

Most of the university-related services were available at all six facilities. Employing aggregated casewide data, Fig. 2 shows the tenants’ reported use
and perceived value-added of the ten universityrelated services provided. The use of student labor
pool, faculty consultants, library and information
database facilities, and research laboratories and
workshops, were reported by more than 50% of
the respondents. Simiiarly, more than 80% of the
respondents valued university image conveyance.
Additionally, the figure shows that there is a high
correlation between the use qf most of the universityrelated services and their perceived value-added.
While most of the typical incubator services
and university-related services were provided at
each of the six facilities, their modes of delivery
differed. There is insufficient data to suggest that
any one of the modes is better than the other.
They all suited the needs of the individual USTI.
Survival and growth of tenant firms

4.13.

Among the changes considered in the tenant
firms’ characteristics during incubation periods are
sales and employment, which show growth trends
during the period of 1986-90 (see Figs. 3 and 4).
As shown, sales growth varied from an average
of 45% per year at TAP to an average of 400%
per year at ED1 (average of all the six facilities
was 166% per year, N = 32). Similarly, the

employment growth varied from an average of
11% per year at TAP to an average of 79% per
year at TIC (average of all the six facilities was
49% per year, N = 33).
In relative terms, TAP (with 45% sales and 11%
employment growth) seems to be the least effective
and ED1 (with 400% sales and 77% employment
growth) the most effective USTI in helping the
client firms grow. It may be noted here that TAP
supports a larger number of relatively smaller tenants
(15 tenants occupying 837 square feet [78 m’] per
tenant) and ED1 supports fewer but larger tenants
(7. tenants occupying 1857 square feet [174 m2] per
tenant). The remaining USTIs fall between these
two extremes. This means that USTIs in general
have a positive impact on their client firms’ growth,
when measured in terms of sales and employment.
No data on tenant dropouts was available for
analysis.

The above six case studies provide an exploratory
analysis and comparison of the six most unique
USTI programs in the country.
The general finding that there appear to be
no significant differences based on the type of
university sponsorship - private such as Northwestein, Lehigh, or Case Western Reserve, and

Technovation

Vol. 14 No. 8

<-----Page 10----->US university-sponsored

public such as Maryland, Georgia Tech, or University of North Carolina at Charlotte - is somewhat
unexpected. This appears to suggest that, in the
US, USTIs are drawing equally from the state and
private sectors irrespective of who takes the
initiative. It seems that across the board, state or
local government funds, along with the university
resources, are being used to lever private funds
and involvement, creating a sense of partnership
among these sectors.
It is interesting to note that, in terms of
articulated objectives, there also appear no clear
distinctions between the types of sponsorship.
However, the fact that TIC has emphasized
university technology transfer more than ATDC
in the past and that TIC (associated with a research
park) intends to break even is revealing. It is
obvious that most state universities are primarily
driven by the need for regional economic development, and that the need for self-reliance through
synergy is perhaps driving the desire for an
incubator-research
park joint project in some
private universities.
It is also noteworthy that facilities such as TAP
and ATDC, which are heavily subsidized by their
states, do not seem motivated to strive for a breakeven operation. Only the TIC’s management,
and to a lesser degree the KC’s management,
expressed their resolve to work for a break-even
in the long run. Both TIC and BCC charge
competitive rents from their clients and are seen
as less restrictive in their entry policies. This may
be explained by the fact that their managers/
directors may have an entrepreneurial management
style. Another plausible explanation may be that
the remaining USTIs (TAP, ATDC, BFI’C and
EDI) do not want to lower the quality of their
services (and hence value-added),
even if they
have to continue receiving subsidies. They may
contend that, by charging market-level rents and
allowing ent,ry to new tenants on the basis of their
ability to pay rents, their mission of allowing only
the desired technology-based firms will be violated.
This conclusion is supported by the more stringent
entry policies listed by these USTIs in comparison
with the remaining two (TIC, BCC).

Flexibility in the implementation
of tenant
selection and graduation policies, especially when
excess rental space is available (such as at BCC
and TIC due to the addition of new buildings),
supports the previous research findings [17]. This
appears to suggest that there may be a trade-off
between stringency in the application of the tenant
selection and other policies and hence value-added
through the provision of the ensuing services, and
the ability to break even. The finding that client
firms generally trusted the USTI management in
providing intellectual property safeguards seems
contrary to commonly held beliefs. It appears that
the clients either had other arrangements to protect
their technology or did not consider it necessary
at this early unproven stage.
As expected, the new and emerging technologies
such as information
and software technology,
electronics and biotechnology dominated all of
the six facilities. Similarly, the average age and
educational level of USTI tenants appear to be
higher than those of small business entrepreneurs in
the US [16]. Findings on tenant firms’ performance
suggest that the USTIs appear to have a positive
impact on their client firms’ survival and growth
as measured in terms of jobs and sales, which is
significant. The USTIs’ degree of financial selfreliance is yet to be realized, and active faculty
participation as entrepreneurs and/or consultants
seems a distant reality. Practically, the relations
between the USTI and the sponsoring unive~ity’s
faculty and students were reported as evolving at
the facilities studied. During the past decade, all
of the universities involved had been in the process
of developing policies to address a number of the
issues relating to the faculty, such as intellectual
property rights and problems in conflict of interest.
But most of the problems occur at a more mundane
level, such as: maintenance of teaching loads,
possible impact on tenure, and balancing the work
loads. No serious attempt has been undertaken to
address these issues.
While this research provided several new insights
into USTIs, numerous questions remain. The study
is based on comparisons between six selected
USTI programs, using mostly self-report data

525

<-----Page 11----->S.A. Mian

that were directly or indirectly collected by the
investigator. Additionally, there is no way of
determining to what extent the presence of the
USTI could be more effective (for an entrepreneur)
than its absence. In spite of these methodological
limitations, these findings present an intriguing
and, to a large extent, favorable picture of the
USTI concept. This combines prior fragmented
beliefs suggesting that incubators play an important
role in the founding of growth-oriented firms [17];
the unive~i~ is seen as (providing) an en~onment

Conclusion and r~ommendations

The above case analyses and their comparison
show that USTIs are providing the necessary
resource base and environment conducive to the
development of NTBFs. It concludes that, despite
their unique origins and types of sponsorship,
successful university-sponsored
technology incubator programs in the US have certain elements
in common. These elements range from the origins
and objectives, various policies and management
practices, and services and their value-added,
to less tangible elements such as the different
performance
outcomes. Taken together,
such
elements represent a checklist of issues that should
be addressed by those seeking to establish a new
USTI program or to evaluate an existing one.
It is recommended that universities must build
their technology incubator programs by setting
reasonable objectives, following policies and management practices that will encourage tangible
results consistent with the new mission requirements of an entrepreneurial university.
More informal assessments suggest that, for USTIs
to ultimately prove to be a successful tool, the
degree of faculty involvement must be increased
through tangible incentives. Additionally, the development of a joint university-sponsored incubator
and research park project seems to offer several
potential benefits, including breaking even and
