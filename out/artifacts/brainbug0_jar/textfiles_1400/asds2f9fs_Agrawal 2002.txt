n this paper we explore the degree to which patents are representative of the magnitude, direction, and impact of the knowledge spilling out of the university by focusing on
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and in particular, on the Departments of
Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data,
we show that patenting is a minority activity: a majority of the faculty in our sample never
patent, and publication rates far outstrip patenting rates. Most faculty members estimate that
patents account for less than 10% of the knowledge that transfers from their labs. Our results
also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of
knowledge generation and transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication
volume, and those ﬁrms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same ﬁrms as those
that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively correlated with paper citations,
suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact. We close by
speculating on the implications of our results for the difﬁcult but important question of
whether, in this setting, patenting acts as a substitute or a complement to the process of
fundamental research.

Introduction

While there is a widespread belief that publicly
funded research conducted at universities has a signiﬁcant impact on the rate of economic growth, estimating the magnitude and describing the nature of
this impact remains extremely difﬁcult. Recent quantitative work in the area has focused particularly on
patents as a measure of university “output” (Jaffe
1989, Henderson et al. 1998), on licenses and on the
new ﬁrms created by licenses (Gregorio and Shane
2000, Jensen and Thursby 1998, Thursby and Thursby
2000), or on patents and licensing considered simultaneously (Mowery et al. 1998). As a logical extension,
patent citation data has been widely used in a variety of studies concerning university innovation (Jaffe
et al. 1993, 1998, Jaffe and Trajtenberg 1996).

Patent and license data has become particularly
important in this context for three reasons. First,
the patenting process requires that inventor names,
dates, assignee institutions, locations, and detailed
descriptions of invention claims be recorded. Such
systematically recorded innovation-related details are
very rare outside of patent records. Second, innovations that are patented are expected, by deﬁnition,
to be commercially useful.1 Third, patenting data has
recently become widely available in machine-readable
form, and aggressive research programs, such as
the one centered at Columbia University (Mowery
et al. 2000), coupled with the generous efforts of

Putting Patents in Context

AUTM (The Association of University Technology
Managers), has recently made much university licensing data available. A focus on patents and licensing as
an important mechanism of knowledge transfer from
universities to the private sector is thus understandable. However, it is almost certainly incomplete.
Public support of university research is commonly
justiﬁed on the grounds that the private sector is
likely to systematically underfund “basic” or fundamental research because the results are, in general,
difﬁcult to appropriate. Thus university research is
largely funded on precisely the premise that mechanisms such as patents will be particularly ill-suited to
capturing the returns. Professors transfer knowledge
through mentoring their students’ research, through
giving conference presentations, and, most notably,
through the free publication of ideas in refereed scientiﬁc publications.2 If patents characterize only a small
proportion of all the work being conducted within the
academy, and, even more importantly, if the research
that is patented is not representative either of the
work being done within the university or of the mode
with which it is generally transferred to the private
sector, then too great a focus on patenting may seriously misrepresent the nature of the impact of the
university on the private sector.
In this paper, we begin to explore this issue by
focusing in depth on two departments at MIT, one of
the nation’s preeminent research institutions. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with the faculty in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering
(hereafter ME) and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (hereafter EECS), coupled with comprehensive quantitative information about each faculty member’s patenting and publication behavior,
we explore the degree to which patenting is representative of the work being conducted at MIT, of the
ways in which it is transferred to the private sector,
and of its ultimate impact.
2
It is important to note that we are referring to the creation and
transfer of new knowledge. This refers to knowledge that is generated from laboratory experiments or theory development and
is of the type that could be patented or published in science- or
engineering-oriented journals. In other words, this does not include
common knowledge contained in textbooks and taught to students
by professors in regular classes.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

Our study builds on work by Zucker and Darby
and their collaborators (Zucker et al. 1998a, 1998b),
who have demonstrated the importance of geographic
proximity, research collaborations, and personal relationships in the transfer of knowledge, on the work of
Cockburn and Henderson (1998), who focus on coauthorships, and on the work of Branstetter (2000), who
focuses on citations to academic papers, as opposed
to patents, as indicators of knowledge transfer. However, in contrast to these studies, which in general
have focused on a single transfer mechanism in depth,
here we attempt to place patenting “in context,”
exploring its importance relative to other mechanisms
of knowledge transfer, particularly journal publications, and the degree to which patenting is representative of knowledge transferred through other channels. This paper is thus most similar in spirit to the
work of Cohen et al. (1998). Cohen and his coauthors used extensive interview data to estimate the
relative importance of patenting as a mechanism for
knowledge transfer from the university. However,
whereas Cohen et al. asked their questions of the
U.S. manufacturing industry, or the “demand” side
of the equation, we complement their work by focusing our inquiries on the university, the “supply” side
of the equation, and by supplementing our qualitative work with comprehensive quantitative data on
patents, papers, and their citations.
Our results suggest that a focus on patenting as
a measure of the impact of university research must
be carefully qualiﬁed by the recognition that patenting may play a relatively small role in the transfer of
knowledge out of the university. As one might expect,
for the faculty in our target departments, publishing
academic papers is a far more important activity than
patenting. In fact, only a small fraction of the faculty
patent at all. On average, only about 10–20% of the
faculty patent in any given year, and nearly half of
the faculty in our sample never ﬁled a patent during the 15-year period under investigation. In contrast, an average of 60% of the faculty publish in
any given year and less than 3% never publish over
the same period. Indeed, even amongst those faculty
that do patent, our informants estimated patents were
responsible for as little as 7% of the knowledge that
was transferred from their labs to industry, a number
45

<-----Page 2----->AGRAWAL AND HENDERSON
Putting Patents in Context

very consistent with the Cohen et al. ﬁnding that only
about 11% of the information obtained from university research was transferred through patents.
Our analysis also suggests that the channel-ofknowledge ﬂow associated with patents may be quite
different from those associated with papers. Branstetter has shown that for the University of California,
citations to academic papers far exceed those to academic patents (Branstetter, 2000). We show that the set
of ﬁrms that most frequently collaborates with MIT
faculty on patented research is very different from the
set of ﬁrms that most frequently collaborates on published research. Moreover, the set of ﬁrms that most
frequently cites MIT patents is very different from
the set that cites MIT papers. Thus, while the patentrelated channel-of-information ﬂow out of the university is important, it is by no means the only channel,
and it may not be representative of the others.
We then tackle the difﬁcult question of whether
patenting activity is a good predictor of publishing
behavior. We show that patenting activity is not a
good predictor of publishing volumes, but that there
is some evidence that those professors who patent
more write papers that are more highly cited, and
thus that patenting volume may be correlated with
research impact.
We close this paper with a brief description of the
degree to which our results speak to the related question of whether patenting is a substitute or complement for more “basic” research. Some observers have
voiced the fear that as researchers focus more on
patenting as a primary means of knowledge transfer, the core goals and values of the university will
be compromised. (See, for example, Cohen et al. 1998
and the references therein.) It is difﬁcult to test this
idea empirically, but our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that, at least at MIT,
patenting is not substituting for more fundamental
research activity for the vast majority of the faculty.
We believe that these results are important. As universities defend their public role and governments
look to maximize their return on investments in public science, it is important to build as clear a picture of the manner in which universities impact the
economy as possible. Our results suggest that a focus
on patenting or licensing statistics, in isolation, may
46

signiﬁcantly misrepresent the nature of the universities’ impact on the economy and that any comprehensive study of the issue must include a focus on the
other channels through which university knowledge
is transferred to private ﬁrms.

Data and Methods

This paper draws upon both qualitative and quantitative data. Since this is an exploratory foray, we focus
on a single university and on two departments, rather
than attempt a broad survey. The heart of the study
is an in-depth, quantitative, and qualitative study of
professors who are currently on the faculty at MIT in
the Departments of Mechanical Engineering (ME) and
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
MIT was chosen as the focal university both for
reasons of convenience (it is the home institution of
one of the authors) and because it is one of the premier research institutions in the United States. In 1998,
MIT claimed almost 4% of all the patents given to
American universities and received over 1.5% of all
federal funding for science and engineering at universities and colleges in ﬁscal year 1999.3 Moreover, it
has historically been ﬁrmly orientated towards a goal
of having an immediate impact on the world around
it. The MIT motto is “hands and mind”: MIT was
founded as a land grant college, and its leaders have
always been concerned about generating value for the
economy in which it is embedded.
We chose to focus on the departments of ME and
EECS because, after biology, they are the departments
that have generated the largest number of patents,
and because biology departments have already been
quite extensively studied. (See, for example, work by
Zucker et al. 1998a, 1998b and more recent work by
the same authors, and work by Blumenthal and his
collaborators, including Blumenthal et al. 1996.) They
are also two of the largest and most vibrant departments at the university, with almost 18% of the Institute’s faculty. The data for this study is based on the
population of professors who were on the faculty in
September 2000 and who generated at least one paper

or patent during the period 1983–1997. This includes
154 EECS professors and 82 ME professors for a total
of 236. Professors enter the population when they
publish their ﬁrst paper or ﬁle their ﬁrst patent during the period under investigation; not all the professors in the sample were active at MIT throughout the
entire period. We chose to focus on the period 1983–
1997 because publication data is available in electronic
format from 1983 onward and patent data necessitates
accommodating two- to three-year lags since we use
application dates rather than issue dates (hence data
stops at 1997).
For this 15-year period, we collected comprehensive data about each paper and patent generated
by every faculty member in the sample as well as
every paper or patent that cited these patents or
papers. Our ﬁnal data set includes information about
640 patents and 5,132 papers assigned to the sample faculty, plus data about the 6,074 patents that cite
these patents, data about the 727 patents that cite
these papers, and data about the 49,975 papers that
cite these papers. Paper data was collected from the
Institute of Scientiﬁc Information’s Science Citation
Index,4 and patent data was collected from the US
Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce database.5
We supplemented this quantitative data with qualitative interview data. We requested a face-to-face
interview with every faculty member in either department who had ever been an inventor on a patented
technology that was licensed from MIT’s Technology Licensing Ofﬁce (TLO). This group was selected
because it was assumed that they would be the most
familiar with the patenting and licensing process due
to their direct experience; in 1999, this was 39% of the
faculty in both departments. Of those faculty members, 74% agreed to meet with us, resulting in an interview sample size of 68.

contrasted with the entire population of which they
are a part. The professors that we interviewed publish slightly more than the population mean, patent a
great deal more, and were active for slightly longer
during the period under investigation. Table 1 also
contrasts the publication and patenting records of
the faculty from the two departments. 35% of the
236 professors studied were from ME. ME professors have slightly higher average rates of publishing, slightly lower rates of patenting, and were active
for slightly less time than their colleagues in EECS.
However, these differences are statistically insigniﬁcant and data for the two departments is aggregated
for purposes of the analyses that follow.
3.2. Patenting as One Mechanism Amongst Many
The recent increase in university patenting, especially
since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, has
been well documented. Figure 1 presents total patents

University Patenting Over Time

assigned to several research universities from 1983–
1997.6 At the aggregate level, these numbers are consistent with a substantial increase in patenting as a
mechanism of university knowledge transfer, as much
of the existing literature suggests. For example, while
there were only 26 patents assigned to MIT in 1983,
there were 130 in 1997, a 400% increase.
Figure 2 shows patenting and publishing rates over
time for our sample in particular. Two things are
immediately apparent. First, as one would expect,
publishing is a much more important activity than
patenting, at least as measured by count data. While
the average faculty member publishes between 1.5
and 2.0 papers a year, they only produce about 0.25
of a patent, or roughly one every four years. Second, while there is some evidence of an increase in
patenting rates (faculty in our sample move from ﬁling roughly 0.18 to 0.28 patents per year7 ), publishing rates were also increasing signiﬁcantly over the

The data for this ﬁgure and all ﬁgures related to patents were generated from the USPTO patent database. Also, patent application
dates, rather than issue dates, are used in this graph and throughout the remainder of the paper.

period.8 The ratio of patents to publications increased
from 0.11 to 0.13 over the period, but it rose from a
very low base.9
Note that these results raise the issue of possible
sample selection bias. Recall that our sample consists only of those professors who were on the faculty
at MIT in September 2000. If “stronger” faculty stay
while “weaker” faculty leave, the apparent increase in
both patenting and publication rates over the period
might be merely an artifact of sample construction. In
order to explore this issue, we compared our sample
against the entire population of EECS and ME professors in terms of both paper and patent output for
9 of the 15 years in our sample.10 Table 2 compares
the average paper-to-patent ratio of the population to
our sample for each of the nine years for which we
have data. There is no systematic difference between
8
Note that publication and patenting rates in 1983 and 1984 are
almost certainly overstated, since faculty members only enter the
sample when they publish or patent. Thus, there is by deﬁnition a
lower fraction of “sleeping” faculty in the early years.
9

It is important to note that these results are likely to be inconsistent with those for the life sciences where, in some cases, patenting
rates per professor have increased substantially.
10

Population data was collected for the years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989,
1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997. These were the years for which
we were able to obtain copies of the MIT catalogue, our source of
professors currently on the faculty.

the sample and the population during this period (zstatistic = 037). Most importantly, only a small fraction of the faculty patent at all. Figure 3 shows the
percentage of faculty members in any given year who
publish, patent, or license. Patenting and licensing is
essentially a minority activity. On average, only about
10–20% of the faculty patent in any given year and 3–
7% license an invention. In contrast, while more than
50% of the sample publish at least one paper in any
given year and less than 3% have never published,
nearly half of our sample have never patented at all!
Figures 4a and 4b expand on this point by illustrating the distribution of professors in terms of patenting and publishing frequency, respectively. Notice
how different these distributions are. Not surprisingly, given the results of Figure 3, the distribution of
patenting faculty is heavily skewed to the left. 44%
Table 2

of the professors have never been an inventor on a
patent, less than 15% have been granted more than
5 patents, and less than 6% have been granted more
than 10 patents. While the distribution of publishing
faculty is also skewed, it has much less mass to the
left, and a signiﬁcant tail at the far right. 14% of the
faculty have published more than 35 papers, while
5% have published more than 100. Given these data,
it is perhaps not surprising that even those faculty
with considerable patent portfolios and/or licensing
experience often dismissed the idea that patenting or
licensing activity could be used as an important measure of their activities:
I don’t think these [patent counts] tell you very much.
I don’t care too much for patents. I wouldn’t have
even bothered to patent most of these things that are
on your list. Most of those were patented by scien-

Note. These mean values were calculated by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of patents
for all professors for a given year, not by averaging the ratio for each individual professor. This method was used
because many professors have no patents in a given year, thus resulting in a zero denominator for their individual paper:patent ratio. As a result of using this method to construct the mean, standard errors to describe the
distribution cannot be calculated and thus are not reported here.

tists from Japanese ﬁrms who were visiting my lab
for 6, or 12, or 18 months. That’s why I am listed
as a coinventor. They ﬁle these patents to show their
companies that they are doing work here, but I don’t
think they really intend to do anything with them.
I certainly haven’t received a penny from any of
these patents. (EECS professor, interview, February
17, 1999)
You can’t just look at the patents. Many people don’t
even care about patents. The patent system is too slow
for them. Look at this list [shows list of over 30 companies founded from MIT inventions]. Only a very
small handful of these have a patent [from MIT]. And
most of these [companies on the list] are, or will be,
world-changing companies. There’s not a very strict
patenting culture here, but we do support and encourage world-changing companies [at this lab]. (EECS
professor, interview, March 1, 1999)

Another piece of evidence that patenting and
licensing may account for a surprisingly small share
of the knowledge that reaches the private sector is
shown in Figure 5, which summarizes the results
of one of the questions that we explored during
our qualitative interviews. Each interview sought to
understand how and why the faculty member worked
with individuals and ﬁrms outside of MIT. In each
case, we worked step by step through the respondent’s CV, asking about each paper and patent, how
it came to be written, and what impact it had had on
the private sector.
50

Table 3 presents our results, and contrasts them
with those obtained by Cohen et al. (1998).11 First,
notice how relatively unimportant faculty members
believe patenting and licensing activity to be: the
mean response is that it carries only 6.6% of the
information transferred out of the university. Second,
notice also how surprisingly consistent the two sets
of results are. Recall that the Cohen et al. results
were obtained by asking US manufacturing ﬁrms how
important they considered various knowledge transfer channels from the university to their industry to
be, while ours were obtained by asking individual
professors. Both view patents and licensing as relatively unimportant (6.6% versus 11.6%), while both
sources list publications as around 18%, and informal channels (“consulting” and “conversations”) as
around 31% of the information that is transferred.12
There are, of course, potentially signiﬁcant limitations associated with our interview data since professors may perceive channels that involve direct interaction with ﬁrms that use their knowledge to be
11

Note that we have rescaled the Cohen et al. results to be compatible with our own, by normalizing the total scores to sum to
100%.

12

Again, it is important to note that there are some exceptional
manufacturing sectors in the Cohen et al. study, namely pharmaceuticals, which do consider patents a very important knowledge
transfer channel.

relatively more important purely because they are
more salient. Faculty might have a tendency to overestimate the relative importance of channels such as
consulting and informal conversations and to underestimate the importance of more indirect channels
such as patents and publications.13 On the other hand,
13

However, it is important to note that the patents and licenses
channel may not be as “indirect” as papers. Agrawal (2000) reports
that approximately two-thirds of his sample of patented inventions
licensed from MIT involved direct interaction between the inventor
and the licensing ﬁrm.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

recall that we interviewed only those faculty that had
patented and licensed at least one invention. One
might expect this group of faculty to overestimate the
importance of patents relative to the mean.
Taken together, these results are consistent with
much prior research, and with the hypothesis that
patenting and licensing constitute a relatively small
channel for the transfer of knowledge from academia
to the private sector. This in itself is reason enough to
think carefully about the degree to which the results
obtained from analyzing university patenting behav51

ior is representative of the nature of knowledge ﬂows
out of the university.
However, if it is the case that patenting is broadly
representative—that is, if the ﬁrms that collaborate
with professors on patents and that cite faculty
patents are the same ﬁrms that engage in other channels of access—then a focus on patenting is more
likely to provide a useful lens through which to view
the impact of the university on the economy, even if
patenting represents a relatively small proportion of
total knowledge transferred. We turn to this question
next.
3.3. Different Firms, Different Channels
In this section we present a preliminary analysis of
patterns in collaboration and citation for our sample.
Speciﬁcally, we examine the degree to which ﬁrms
that collaborate on or cite MIT patents are the same
as those that collaborate on or cite MIT papers. Our
results suggest that there is signiﬁcant variation in
terms of the particular ﬁrms that employ the various
channels. Figures 6a and 6b illustrate the degree to
which the ﬁrms that use MIT patents are also those
that use or reference MIT papers.
Figure 6a shows that more ﬁrms collaborate on
papers than patents and that the fraction of ﬁrms
52

that engage both channels is quite small. Speciﬁcally,
58% of the ﬁrms that collaborated with this set of
professors did so by writing papers together, but
did not write patents together. Even amongst the 20
ﬁrms with the highest number of paper collaborations, which account for 83% of the total number of
paper collaborations, 14 of these ﬁrms did not collaborate on any patents. Thus, any examination of patent
collaborations would miss a substantial fraction of
those ﬁrms that engage in the type of collaborative
research that results in journal publications.
Figure 6b illustrates that while there are more ﬁrms
that cite MIT patents than papers, the set of ﬁrms that
cite papers is not a strict subset of the former. In fact,
24% of all citing ﬁrms never cite MIT patents. Specifically, 11% only write papers that cite MIT papers
and 13% write patents that only cite MIT papers, not
patents. These ﬁrms would be missed in analyses
that only include ﬁrms that cite MIT patents. Even
amongst the 20 ﬁrms with the highest number of citing papers, which account for 67% of the total number
of citing papers, six of these ﬁrms did not write any
citing patents. Thus, once again, an examination of
patent citations misses a substantial fraction of those
ﬁrms that engage in the type of research that results
in the writing of papers that cite MIT papers.
Collectively, the data presented in Figures 6a and
6b support the idea that different ﬁrms employ quite
different channels for gaining access to MIT-produced
knowledge. These results are preliminary, but they
are consistent with the hypothesis that a focus on
those ﬁrms that cite or that collaborate in writing MIT
patents may not accurately represent the set of ﬁrms
that gain knowledge from MIT.
3.4.

Patenting Activity as a Predictor of
Publishing Behavior
We next focus on the degree to which patenting
activity is a good predictor of publishing activity or
impact. On the quantitative front, Figure 7a shows a
scatter plot of total patents versus total publications,
where the unit of observation is the professor. There
is no clear relationship between the two, and the plot
illustrates the great diversity of behavior across the
faculty. Figure (7b) shows a similar scatter plot where
the data has been age-adjusted such that the total

paper and patent output has been divided by the
number of years each professor was active during the
period under investigation. Still, no clear relationship
is evident. If anything, the plot might suggest a negative correlation between patenting and publishing
behavior, with a few individuals publishing heavily
but not patenting and a few patenting heavily but not
publishing. However, as we will show, the relationship is not statistically signiﬁcant and is in fact positive when patents are compared to paper citations.
Table 4a extends this analysis by showing correlation coefﬁcients for a variety of ﬂow measures of
patenting and publishing behavior. While it is reasonable to assume that in most cases a patent and a
paper written in the same year will be measured in
the same year since we use patent application dates

and paper publication dates, we include three oneyear lag variables for each measure to capture any
systematic variations from this assumption.14 While
there is clearly correlation across publishing behavior over time (0.76, 0.73, and 0.62 are the correlation
coefﬁcients of papert with papert−1 , papert−2 , and
papert−3 , respectively), as well as patenting behavior
over time (0.49, 0.41, 0.30), there is very little evidence
that patenting and publishing behavior are correlated
with each other (0.01, −0.003, −0.004, and −0.02 are
the correlation coefﬁcients of papert with patentt ,
patentt−1 , patentt−2 , and patentt−3 , respectively).

Most science and engineering publications have a publication
cycle that is less than one year from the time of receiving the ﬁrst
draft. This is in contrast to many areas in the social sciences where
the lag is often two to three years.

Note. Percentage may not sum to exactly 100% due to rounding.

Similarly Table 4b presents correlation coefﬁcients for
stock measures of patenting and publishing behavior including totals and averages. While the correlation between total patents and papers is measurable
(0.10), this is largely due to the variance in the number of active years across professors. When this factor
is controlled for by taking patent and paper output
averaged over years, the coefﬁcient is much smaller
(0.04).

to explore this issue more systematically. Table 5

an error term. Fixed effect models are used to analyze
this panel data.15
In Speciﬁcation (5.1) (see Table 5), we begin by
regressing a simple count of publications on a count
of patents, both current and lagged, without including
any control variables. None of the coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant (p-values are 0.82, 0.74, 0.88, and 0.25, respectively). Next, we add lagged publication measures in
(5.2) which are highly signiﬁcant (p < 001 for all measures). In other words, while the number of papers
written three years ago is related to the number of
papers written today, the number of patents written
today or in any of the last three years appears to
be unrelated to current paper output. Then, in (5.3),
we add a control for the number of years at time
t the professor has been active during the period
under investigation. One might suspect that this control would eliminate the relationship between current and lagged paper output. However, it does not.

The lagged measures of paper output remain highly
signiﬁcant and the current and lagged measures of
patent output remain insigniﬁcant.16 In (5.4), we test
the reverse relationship and estimate the effects of
paper output on patent output. The results are very
similar. While one- and two-year lagged patent measures and the number of years that the professor has
been active are positively related to current patent
output, none of the paper count variables are significant, and Granger causality tests in both directions
suggest that patent and paper outputs are independent. Speciﬁcation (5.5) relaxes the strict constraint
of comparing a single year’s publishing output with
a single year’s patenting output by including stock
rather than ﬂow measures.17 Our core result continues to hold: patenting activity does not appear to be
signiﬁcantly related to publishing activity.
16

15

A series of Hausman tests indicates that the hypotheses that individual effects follow a random-normal distribution are rejected for
several speciﬁcations presented in these tables such that we do not
use the random-effects model that would otherwise provide more
efﬁcient speciﬁcations.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

We also test for individual year effects using a speciﬁcation similar to (5.3) but including dummy variables for each year. The coefﬁcients on year dummies are generally insigniﬁcant. This result is
not reported in Table 5.

17

We use a depreciation rate of 20%, which is standard for this kind
of analysis (see Henderson and Cockburn, 1996).

57

<-----Page 14----->AGRAWAL AND HENDERSON
Putting Patents in Context

The results presented in Table 6 explore the degree
to which patenting activity is related to the degree to
which a professor’s work is cited. We estimate speciﬁcations of the general form:
stock of paper citationsit
=  +  stock of patentsit + 	xit + it 

(2)

where, as above, xit is a vector of control variables
and it is the error term.
These results are more interesting. We include the
stock of papers as a control variable in every regression since we expect paper citations to increase as
the number of published papers increases. Model (6.1)
(see Table 6) suggests that the stock of patents is positively related to the stock of paper citations, even after
controlling for the stock of papers. While this effect is
reduced by more than half (the coefﬁcient drops from
6.0 to 2.6) after controlling for the number of years
the professor has been active (6.2), the relationship is
still positive and statistically signiﬁcant.
Notice that the signiﬁcance of these results lends
additional credibility to the insigniﬁcance of our
results in Table 5, suggesting that while patent counts
are not good predictors of paper counts, or with the
volume of a faculty member’s research, they are correlated with paper citations, or with its impact.
Speciﬁcation (6.3) explores another measure of
impact, and regresses the depreciated stock of the
patents that cite each professor’s papers against their
stock of patents and papers. Once again, we ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant and positive coefﬁcient on patent stock,
even when we control for the stock of papers and the
number of active years. Collectively, these results suggest that while patent counts are not a good predictor
of publication counts, they are a reasonable predictor
of the “importance” of a professor’s publications, as
measured by citations.
3.5. Patents: Substitute or Complement?
Lastly, we turn to the difﬁcult question of the degree
to which patenting acts as a substitute or complement to the process of conducting fundamental
research. In commercial settings, basic, or “fundamental,” research is often considered a substitute for
more applied work (Cockburn et al. 2001). Several
58

observers have worried that a similar dynamic may
be at work within universities, and that an increasing focus on the commercial implications of university
research may skew university faculty away from the
more fundamental work that universities were originally created to produce.
Our qualitative interviews suggest that neither
patenting nor publishing is generally the motivation
for selecting a particular research agenda. Most faculty members claim that they do not embark on a
research program with a particular patent or paper
outcome in mind. Rather, they suggest that they are
engaged in a research stream that they ﬁnd interesting
and challenging, and that they make patent or publish
decisions on a case-by-case basis. This is not to imply
that some professors do not have a greater disposition towards patenting than others, but our interviews
suggested that the patent-versus-paper question did
not seem to drive the direction of research programs,
at least in most cases. The following quote is representative:
I don’t consciously do patentable research instead of
publishable research, or vice versa. First of all, most
patentable research is also publishable. Second, when
I start working on a research project I have no idea
whether it’s ever going to result in anything useful,
let alone a patented invention or a published journal
paper. I work with a number of colleagues and on
a variety of research trajectories. When we get on to
something that looks like it might be patentable, if
we have time, and if we’re motivated, we check out
whether it’s worth patenting. However, it is useful to
talk to industry people with real problems because
they often reveal interesting research questions—but
sometimes they try to steer you towards patenting. Sometimes that research results in something
patentable, sometimes not. (EECS professor, interview, April 6, 1999)

Our quantitative results are more ambiguous. On
one hand, there are a small group of faculty who
appear to patent much more proportionately than
their peers (Figures 7a and 7b). On the other hand,
if patenting activity was substituting for fundamental research for a majority of the faculty, one might
expect publication rates to be negatively correlated
with patent counts. Not only have we shown that this
is not the case, but we have also demonstrated that
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 15----->AGRAWAL AND HENDERSON
Putting Patents in Context

there is some reason to believe that increasing patenting activity is correlated with increased rates of citation to the faculty member’s publications. This result
might reﬂect the fact that patent counts are a good
measure of the degree to which research results can be
immediately applied so that faculty who patent extensively are at increased risk of citation from industry.
However, it is important to note that we measure total
citation counts, academic as well as industrial, so that
our result is also consistent with the hypothesis that
patenting may actually be a complement to fundamental research.

4.

Conclusions

What are the implications of these results for the use
of patent-related metrics in studies of university innovation and knowledge transfer? First, they underline
the well-established idea that patents are a relatively
small channel for the transfer of knowledge out of the
university. Echoing Branstetter (2000) and consistent
with Cohen et al. (1998), we showed that MIT professors write far more papers than patents, and that
many faculty members never patent at all. Moreover,
our results suggest that patterns of patent citations
may not be representative of wider patterns of collaboration or paper citation: different ﬁrms appear to use
quite different channels to access knowledge at MIT.
They also suggest that patent counts are not useful
measures of the overall output of new knowledge, if
publication count is taken to be a reasonable measure
of such output. These results imply reasonably serious
limitations in terms of generalizability across channels and overall knowledge transfer when interpreting results based purely on patent-related data. Second, there is some evidence that patent counts may
be correlated with the “impact” of a faculty member’s
research, at least as measured by paper citations. This
result is of signiﬁcant interest because it suggests that
patent data may offer some insight into the impact
of university research. Finally, we suggested that our
results offer some evidence that, at least at these two
departments at MIT, patenting is not substituting for
more fundamental research, and that it might even be
a complementary activity.
Clearly, much remains to be done. We plan to conduct a much ﬁner-grained analysis of the degree to
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

which different ﬁrms use different channels to access
knowledge: Our data set contains information about
many thousands of ﬁrms, and we hope to use it to
explore the degree to which our preliminary analysis
is representative of the larger universe. Moreover, we
are curious as to why different ﬁrms choose to use
different channels. Are they signiﬁcantly different?
Do they make quite different use of MIT-generated
knowledge?
In addition, we plan to focus in much more depth
on heterogeneity in faculty behavior across departments and over time. Do faculty who patent widely
and whose patents are widely cited “look different”
from their colleagues? Do they work with different
types of ﬁrms? We are hopeful that these data will
allow us to begin to make progress on these and
related questions.
