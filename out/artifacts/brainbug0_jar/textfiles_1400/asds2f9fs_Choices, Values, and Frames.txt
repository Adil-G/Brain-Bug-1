Choices, Values, and Frames
Daniel Kahneman
Amos Tversky

ABSTRACT: We discuss the cognitive and the psychophysical determinants of choice in risky and riskless contexts. The psychophysics of value induce risk
aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in
the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance
induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable
events, relative to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described orframed in multiple
ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary
to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize
the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies
of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability
of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome
is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss.
The relation between decision values and experience
values is discussed.
Making decisions is like speaking prose—people do
it all the time, knowingly or unknowingly. It is hardly
surprising, then, that the topic of decision making is
shared by many disciplines, from mathematics and
statistics, through economics and political science, to
sociology and psychology. The study of decisions addresses both normative and descriptive questions. The
normative analysis is concerned with the nature of
rationality and the logic of decision making. The descriptive analysis, in contrast, is concerned with people's beliefs and preferences as they are, not as they
should be. The tension between normative and descriptive considerations characterizes much of the
study of judgment and choice.
Analyses of decision making commonly distinguish risky and riskless choices. The paradigmatic
example of decision under risk is the acceptability of
a gamble that yields monetary outcomes with specified
probabilities. A typical riskless decision concerns the
acceptability of a transaction in which a good or a
service is exchanged for money or labor. In the first
part of this article we present an analysis of the cognitive and psychophysical factors that determine the
value of risky prospects. In the second part we extend
this analysis to transactions and trades.

Risky Choice
Risky choices, such as whether or not to take an
umbrella and whether or not to go to war, are made
without advance knowledge of their consequences.
Because the consequences of such actions depend on
uncertain events such as the weather or the opponent's
resolve, the choice of an act may be construed as the
acceptance of a gamble that can yield various outcomes with different probabilities. It is therefore natural that the study of decision making under risk has
focused on choices between simple gambles with
monetary outcomes and specified probabilities, in the
hope that these simple problems will reveal basic attitudes toward risk and value.
We shall sketch an approach to risky choice that
derives many of its hypotheses from a psychophysical
analysis of responses to money and to probability.
The psychophysical approach to decision making can
be traced to a remarkable essay that Daniel Bernoulli
published in 1738 (Bernoulli 1738/1954) in which
he attempted to explain why people are generally
averse to risk and why risk aversion decreases with
increasing wealth. To illustrate risk aversion and Bernoulli's analysis, consider the choice between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1000 (with a
15% chance to win nothing) and the alternative of
receiving $800 for sure. A large majority of people
prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although the
gamble has higher (mathematical) expectation. The
expectation of a monetary gamble is a weighted average, where each possible outcome is weighted by
its probability of occurrence. The expectation of the
gamble in this example is .85 X $1000 + .15 X
$0 = $850, which exceeds the expectation of $800
associated with the sure thing. The preference for the
sure gain is an instance of risk aversion. In general,
a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble that
has higher or equal expectation is called risk averse,
and the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble
of lower or equal expectation is called risk seeking.
Bernoulli suggested that people do not evaluate
prospects by the expectation of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expectation of the subjective
341

<-----Page 1----->value of these outcomes. The subjective value of a
gamble is again a weighted average, but now it is the
subjective value of each outcome that is weighted by
its probability. To explain risk aversion within this
framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value,
or utility, is a concave function of money. In such a
function, the difference between the utilities of $200
and $ 100, for example, is greater than the utility difference between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from
concavity that the subjective value attached to a gain
of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of
$1,000. Consequently, the concavity of the utility
function entails a risk averse preference for a sure
gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win $1,000,
although the two prospects have the same monetary
expectation.
It is customary in decision analysis to describe
the outcomes of decisions in terms of total wealth.
For example, an offer to bet $20 on the toss of a fair
coin is represented as a choice between an individual's
current wealth W and an even chance to move to
W + $20 or to W — $20. This representation appears
psychologically unrealistic: People do not normally
think of relatively small outcomes in terms of states
of wealth but rather in terms of gains, losses, and
neutral outcomes (such as the maintenance of the
status quo). If the effective carriers of subjective value
are changes of wealth rather than ultimate states of
wealth, as we propose, the psychophysical analysis of
outcomes should be applied to gains and losses rather
than to total assets. This assumption plays a central
role in a treatment of risky choice that we called
prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Introspection as well as psychophysical measurements
suggest that subjective value is a concave function of
the size of a gain. The same generalization applies to
losses as well. The difference in subjective value between a loss of $200 and a loss of $ 100 appears greater
than the difference in subjective value between a loss
of $ 1,200 and a loss of $ 1,100. When the value functions for gains and for losses are pieced together, we
obtain an S-shaped function of the type displayed in
Figure 1.

A Hypothetical Value Function

VALUE

LOSSES

GAINS

The value function shown in Figure I is (a) denned on gains and losses rather than on total wealth,
(b) concave in the domain of gains and convex in the
domain of losses, and (c) considerably steeper for losses
than for gains. The last property, which we label loss
aversion, expresses the intuition that a loss of $X is
more aversive than a gain of $X is attractive. Loss
aversion explains people's reluctance to bet on a fair
coin for equal stakes: The attractiveness of the possible
gain is not nearly sufficient to compensate for the
aversiveness of the possible loss. For example, most
respondents in a sample of undergraduates refused
to stake $10 on the toss of a coin if they stood to
win less than $30.
The assumption of risk aversion has played a
central role in economic theory. However, just as the
concavity of the value of gains entails risk aversion,
the convexity of the value of losses entails risk seeking.
Indeed, risk seeking in losses is a robust effect, particularly when the probabilities of loss are substantial.
Consider, for example, a situation in which an individual is forced to choose between an 85% chance
to lose $1,000 (with a 15% chance to lose nothing)
and a sure loss of $800. A large majority of people
express a preference for the gamble over the sure loss.
This is a risk seeking choice because the expectation
of the gamble (—$850) is inferior to the expectation
of the sure loss (—$800). Risk seeking in the domain
of losses has been confirmed by several investigators
(Fishburn & Kochenberger, 1979; Hershey & Schoemaker, 1980; Payne, Laughhunn, & Crum, 1980;
Slovic, FischhofF, & Lichtenstein, 1982). It has also
been observed with nonmonetary outcomes, such as
hours of pain (Eraker & Sox, 1981) and loss of human
lives (Fischhoff, 1983; Tversky, 1977; Tversky &
April 1984 • American Psychologist

<-----Page 2----->Kahneman, 1981). Is it wrong to be risk averse in
the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain
of losses? These preferences conform to compelling
intuitions about the subjective value of gains and
losses, and the presumption is that people should be
entitled to their own values. However, we shall see
that an S-shaped value function has implications that
are normatively unacceptable.
To address the normative issue we turn from
psychology to decision theory. Modern decision theory
can be said to begin with the pioneering work of von
Neumann and Morgenstern (1947), who laid down
several qualitative principles, or axioms, that should
govern the preferences of a rational decision maker.
Their axioms included transitivity (if A is preferred
to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to
C), and substitution (if A is preferred to B, then an
even chance to get A or C is preferred to an even
chance to get B or C), along with other conditions of
a more technical nature. The normative and the descriptive status of the axioms of rational choice have
been the subject of extensive discussions. In particular,
there is convincing evidence that people do not always
obey the substitution axiom, and considerable disagreement exists about the normative merit of this
axiom (e.g., Allais & Hagen, 1979). However, all analyses of rational choice incorporate two principles:
dominance and invariance. Dominance demands that
if prospect A is at least as good as prospect B in every
respect and better than B in at least one respect, then
A should be preferred to B. Invariance requires that
the preference order between prospects should not
depend on the manner in which they are described.
In particular, two versions of a choice problem that
are recognized to be equivalent when shown together
should elicit the same preference even when shown
separately. We now show that the requirement of invariance, however elementary and innocuous it may
seem, cannot generally be satisfied.
Framing of Outcomes
Risky prospects are characterized by their possible
outcomes and by the probabilities of these outcomes.
The same option, however, can be framed or described
in different ways (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). For
example, the possible outcomes of a gamble can be
framed either as gains and losses relative to the status
quo or as asset positions that incorporate initial
wealth. Invariance requires that such changes in the
description of outcomes should not alter the preference order. The following pair of problems illustrates
a violation of this requirement. The total number of
respondents in each problem is denoted by N, and
the percentage who chose each option is indicated in
parentheses.
Problem 1 (N = 152): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing
for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is

April 1984 • American Psychologist

expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to
combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the
exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:
If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. (72%)
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability
that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability
that no people will be saved. (28%)
Which of the two programs would you favor?

The formulation of Problem 1 implicitly adopts
as a reference point a state of affairs in which the
disease is allowed to take its toll of 600 lives. The
outcomes of the programs include the reference state
and two possible gains, measured by the number of
lives saved. As expected, preferences are risk averse:
A clear majority of respondents prefer saving 200
lives for sure over a gamble that offers a one-third
chance of saving 600 lives. Now consider another
problem in which the same cover story is followed
by a different description of the prospects associated
with the two programs:
Problem 2 (N = 155): If Program C is adopted, 400 people
will die. (22%)
If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability
that nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600
people will die. (78%)

It is easy to verify that options C and D in Problem 2 are undistinguishable in real terms from options
A and B in Problem 1, respectively. The second version, however, assumes a reference state in which no
one dies of the disease. The best outcome is the
maintenance of this state and the alternatives are losses
measured by the number of people that will die of
the disease. People who evaluate options in these terms
are expected to show a risk seeking preference for
the gamble (option D) over the sure loss of 400 lives,
Indeed, there is more risk seeking in the second version
of the problem than there is risk aversion in the first.
The failure of invariance is both pervasive and
robust. It is as common among sophisticated respondents as among naive ones, and it is not eliminated even when the same respondents answer both
questions within a few minutes. Respondents confronted with their conflicting answers are typically
puzzled. Even after rereading the problems, they still
wish to be risk averse in the "lives saved" version;
they wish to be risk seeking in the "lives lost" version;
and they also wish to obey invariance and give consistent answers in the two versions. In their stubborn
appeal, framing effects resemble perceptual illusions
more than computational errors.
The following pair of problems elicits preferences
that violate the dominance requirement of rational
choice.

343

<-----Page 3----->Problem 3 (N = 86): Choose between:
E. 25% chance to win $240 and
75% chance to lose $760

(0%)

F. 25% chance to win $250 and
75% chance to lose $750

(100%)

It is easy to see that F dominates E. Indeed, all
respondents chose accordingly.
Problem 4 (N = 150): Imagine that you face the following
pair of concurrent decisions. First examine both decisions,
then indicate the options you prefer.
Decision (i) Choose between:
A. a sure gain of $240
B. 25% chance to gain $1000 and
75% chance to gain nothing
Decision (ii) Choose between:
C. a sure loss of $750
D. 75% chance to lose $1000 and
25% chance to lose nothing

(84%)
(16%)
(13%)
(87%)

As expected from the previous analysis, a large
majority of subjects made a risk averse choice for the
sure gain over the positive gamble in the first decision,
and an even larger majority of subjects made a risk
seeking choice for the gamble over the sure loss in
the second decision. In fact, 73% of the respondents
chose A and D and only 3% chose B and C. The same
pattern of results was observed in a modified version
of the problem, with reduced stakes, in which undergraduates selected gambles that they would actually
play.
Because the subjects considered the two decisions
in Problem 4 simultaneously, they expressed in effect
a preference for A and D over B and C. The preferred
conjunction, however, is actually dominated by the
rejected one. Adding the sure gain of $240 (option
A) to option D yields 25% chance to win $240 and
75% to lose $760. This is precisely option E in Problem 3, Similarly, adding the sure loss of $750 (option
C) to option B yields a 25% chance to win $250 and
75% chance to lose $750. This is precisely option F
in Problem 3. Thus, the susceptibility to framing and
the S-shaped value function produce a violation of
dominance in a set of concurrent decisions.
The moral of these results is disturbing: In variance is normatively essential, intuitively compelling,
and psychologically unfeasible. Indeed, we conceive
only two ways of guaranteeing invariance. The first
is to adopt a procedure that will transform equivalent
versions of any problem into the same canonical representation. This is the rationale for the standard admonition to students of business, that they should
consider each decision problem in terms of total assets
rather than in terms of gains or losses (Schlaifer, 1959).
Such a representation would avoid the violations of
invariance illustrated in the previous problems, but
the advice is easier to give than to follow. Except in
344

the context of possible ruin, it is more natural to
consider financial outcomes as gains and losses rather
than as states of wealth. Furthermore, a canonical
representation of risky prospects requires a compounding of all outcomes of concurrent decisions (e.g.,
Problem 4) that exceeds the capabilities of intuitive
computation even in simple problems. Achieving a
canonical representation is even more difficult in other
contexts such as safety, health, or quality of life.
Should we advise people to evaluate the consequence
of a public health policy (e.g., Problems 1 and 2) in
terms of overall mortality, mortality due to diseases,
or the number of deaths associated with the particular
disease under study?
Another approach that could guarantee invariance is the evaluation of options in terms of their
actuarial rather than their psychological consequences.
The actuarial criterion has some appeal in the context
of human lives, but it is clearly inadequate for financial
choices, as has been generally recognized at least since
Bernoulli, and it is entirely inapplicable to outcomes
that lack an objective metric. We conclude that frame
invariance cannot be expected to hold and that a
sense of confidence in a particular choice does not
ensure that the same choice would be made in another
frame. It is therefore good practice to test the robustness of preferences by deliberate attempts to
frame a decision problem in more than one way
(Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1980).
The Psychophysics of Chances
Our discussion so far has assumed a Bernoullian expectation rule according to which the value, or utility,
of an uncertain prospect is obtained by adding the
utilities of the possible outcomes, each weighted by
its probability. To examine this assumption, let us
again consult psychophysical intuitions. Setting the
value of the status quo at zero, imagine a cash gift,
say of $300, and assign it a value of one. Now imagine
that you are only given a ticket to a lottery that has
a single prize of $300. How does the value of the
ticket vary as a function of the probability of winning
the prize? Barring utility for gambling, the value of
such a prospect must vary between zero (when the
chance of winning is nil) and one (when winning
$300 is a certainty).
Intuition suggests that the value of the ticket is
not a linear function of the probability of winning,
as entailed by the expectation rule. In particular, an
increase from 0% to 5% appears to have a larger effect
than an increase from 30% to 35%, which also appears
smaller than an increase from 95% to 100%. These
considerations suggest a category-boundary effect: A
change from impossibility to possibility or from possibility to certainty has a bigger impact than a comparable change in the middle of the scale. This hypothesis is incorporated into the curve displayed in
April 1984 • American Psychologist

<-----Page 4----->Figure 2, which plots the weight attached to an event
as a function of its stated numerical probability. The
most salient feature of Figure 2 is that decision weights
are regressive with respect to stated probabilities. Except near the endpoints, an increase of .05 in the
probability of winning increases the value of the prospect by less than 5% of the value of the prize. We
next investigate the implications of these psychophysical hypotheses for preferences among risky options.
In Figure 2, decision weights are lower than the
corresponding probabilities over most of the range.
Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities
relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in
gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also contributes to risk seeking
in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of negative
gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, and very low probabilities are either overweighted quite grossly or neglected altogether, making
the decision weights highly unstable in that region.
The overweighting of low probabilities reverses the
pattern described above: It enhances the value of long
shots and amplifies the aversiveness of a small chance
of a severe loss. Consequently, people are often risk
seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk
averse in dealing with unlikely losses. Thus, the characteristics of decision weights contribute to the attractiveness of both lottery tickets and insurance policies.
The nonlinearity of decision weights inevitably
leads to violations of invariance, as illustrated in the
following pair of problems:
Problem 5 (N = 85): Consider the following two-stage game.
In the first stage, there is a 75% chance to end the game
without winning anything and a 25% chance to move into
the second stage. If you reach the second stage you have a
choice between:
A. a sure win of $30
B. 80% chance to win $45

(74%)
(26%)

Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e.,
before the outcome of the first stage is known. Please indicate
the option you prefer.
Problem 6 (N = 81): Which of the following options do
you prefer?
C. 25% chance to win $30
D. 20% chance to win $45

(42%)
(58%)

Because there is one chance in four to move into
the second stage in Problem 5, prospect A offers a
.25 probability of winning $30, and prospect B offers
.25 X .80 = .20 probability of winning $45. Problems
5 and 6 are therefore identical in terms of probabilities
and outcomes. However, the preferences are not the
same in the two versions: A clear majority favors the
higher chance to win the smaller amount in Problem

5, whereas the majority goes the other way in Problem
6. This violation of invariance has been confirmed
with both real and hypothetical monetary payoffs (the
present results are with real money), with human
lives as outcomes, and with a nonsequential representation of the chance process.
We attribute the failure of invariance to the interaction of two factors: the framing of probabilities
and the nonlinearity of decision weights. More specifically, we propose that in Problem 5 people ignore
the first phase, which yields the same outcome regardless of the decision that is made, and focus their
attention on what happens if they do reach the second
stage of the game. In that case, of course, they face
a sure gain if they choose option A and an 80% chance
of winning if they prefer to gamble. Indeed, people's
choices in the sequential version are practically identical to the choices they make between a sure gain
of $30 and an 85% chance to win $45. Because a
sure thing is overweighted in comparison with events
of moderate or high probability (see Figure 2) the
option that may lead to a gain of $30 is more attractive
in the sequential version. We call this phenomenon
the pseudo-certainty effect because an event that is
actually uncertain is weighted as if it were certain.
A closely related phenomenon can be demonstrated at the low end of the probability range. Suppose
you are undecided whether or not to purchase earthquake insurance because the premium is quite high.
As you hesitate, your friendly insurance agent comes

345

<-----Page 5----->forth with an alternative offer: "For half the regular
premium you can be fully covered if the quake occurs
on an odd day of the month. This is a good deal
because for half the price you are covered for more
than half the days." Why do most people find such
probabilistic insurance distinctly unattractive? Figure
2 suggests an answer. Starting anywhere in the region
of low probabilities, the impact on the decision weight
of a reduction of probability from p to p/2 is considerably smaller than the effect of a reduction from
p/2 to 0. Reducing the risk by half, then, is not worth
half the premium.
The aversion to probabilistic insurance is significant for three reasons. First, it undermines the
classical explanation of insurance in terms of a concave utility function. According to expected utility
theory, probabilistic insurance should be definitely
preferred to normal insurance when the latter is just
acceptable (see Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Second,
probabilistic insurance represents many forms of
protective action, such as having a medical checkup,
buying new tires, or installing a burglar alarm system.
Such actions typically reduce the probability of some
hazard without eliminating it altogether. Third, the
acceptability of insurance can be manipulated by the
framing of the contingencies. An insurance policy
that covers fire but not flood, for example, could be
evaluated either as full protection against a specific
risk, (e.g., fire) or as a reduction in the overall probability of property loss. Figure 2 suggests that people
greatly undervalue a reduction in the probability of
a hazard in comparison to the complete elimination
of that hazard. Hence, insurance should appear more
attractive when it is framed as the elimination of risk
than when it is described as a reduction of risk. Indeed,
Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982) showed that
a hypothetical vaccine that reduces the probability
of contracting a disease from 20% to 10% is less attractive if it is described as effective in half of the
cases than if it is presented as fully effective against
one of two exclusive and equally probable virus strains
tliat produce identical symptoms.

for lung cancer varied markedly when their probable
outcomes were described in terms of mortality or
survival. Surgery, unlike radiation therapy, entails a
risk of death during treatment. As a consequence,
the surgery option was relatively less attractive when
the statistics of treatment outcomes were described
in terms of mortality rather than in terms of survival.
A physician, and perhaps a presidential advisor
as well, could influence the decision made by the
patient or by the President, without distorting or suppressing information, merely by the framing of outcomes and contingencies. Formulation effects can occur fortuitously, without anyone being aware of the
impact of the frame on the ultimate decision. They
can also be exploited deliberately to manipulate the
relative attractiveness of options. For example, Thaler
(1980) noted that lobbyists for the credit card industry
insisted that any price difference between cash and
credit purchases be labeled a cash discount rather
than a credit card surcharge. The two labels frame
the price difference as a gain or as a loss by implicitly
designating either the lower or the higher price as
normal. Because losses loom larger than gains, consumers are less likely to accept a surcharge than to
forego a discount. As is to be expected, attempts to
influence framing are common in the marketplace
and in the political arena.
The evaluation of outcomes is susceptible to formulation effects because of the nonlinearity of the
value function and the tendency of people to evaluate
options in relation to the reference point that is suggested or implied by the statement of the problem.
It is worthy of note that in other contexts people
automatically transform equivalent messages into the
same representation. Studies of language comprehension indicate that people quickly recede much of
what they hear into an abstract representation that
no longer distinguishes whether the idea was expressed
in an active or in a passive form and no longer discriminates what was actually said from what was implied, presupposed, or implicated (Clark & Clark,
1977). Unfortunately, the mental machinery that performs these operations silently and effortlessly is not

<-----Page 6----->the reference state. Thus, an option is acceptable if
the value of its advantages exceeds the value of its
disadvantages. This analysis assumes psychological—
but not physical—separability of advantages and disadvantages. The model does not constrain the manner
in which separate attributes are combined to form
overall measures of advantage and of disadvantage,
but it imposes on these measures assumptions of concavity and of loss aversion.
Our analysis of mental accounting owes a large
debt to the stimulating work of Richard Thaler (1980,
in press), who showed the relevance of this process
to consumer behavior. The following problem, based
on examples of Savage (1954) and Thaler (1980), introduces some of the rules that govern the construction
of mental accounts and illustrates the extension of
the concavity of value to the acceptability of transactions.
Problem 7: Imagine that you are about to purchase a jacket
for $125 and a calculator for $15. The calculator salesman
informs you that the calculator you wish to buy is on sale
for $ 10 at the other branch of the store, located 20 minutes
drive away. Would you make a trip to the other store?

This problem is concerned with the acceptability of
an option that combines a disadvantage of inconvenience with a financial advantage that can be framed
as a minimal, topical, or comprehensive account. The
minimal account includes only the differences between the two options and disregards the features that
they share. In the minimal account, the advantage
associated with driving to the other store is framed
as a gain of $5. A topical account relates the consequences of possible choices to a reference level that
is determined by the context within which the decision
arises. In the preceding problem, the relevant topic
is the purchase of the calculator, and the benefit of
the trip is therefore framed as a reduction of the
price, from $15 to $10. Because the potential saving
is associated only with the calculator, the price of the
jacket is not included in the topical account. The
price of the jacket, as well as other expenses, could
well be included in a more comprehensive account
in which the saving would be evaluated in relation
to, say, monthly expenses.
The formulation of the preceding problem appears neutral with respect to the adoption of a minimal, topical, or comprehensive account. We suggest,
however, that people will spontaneously frame decisions in terms of topical accounts that, in the context
of decision making, play a role analogous to that of
"good forms" in perception and of basic-level categories in cognition. Topical organization, in conjunction with the concavity of value, entails that the
willingness to travel to the other store for a saving of
$5 on a calculator should be inversely related to the
price of the calculator and should be independent of
April 1984 • American Psychologist

the price of the jacket. To test this prediction, we
constructed another version of the problem in which
the prices of the two items were interchanged. The
price of the calculator was given as $125 in the first
store and $120 in the other branch, and the price of
the jacket was set at $ 15. As predicted, the proportions
of respondents who said they would make the trip
differed sharply in the two problems. The results
showed that 68% of the respondents (N = 88) were
willing to drive to the other branch to save $5 on a
$15 calculator, but only 29% of 93 respondents were
willing to make the same trip to save $5 on a $125
calculator. This finding supports the notion of topical
organization of accounts, since the two versions are
identical both in terms of a minimal and a comprehensive account.
The significance of topical accounts for consumer
behavior is confirmed by the observation that the
standard deviation of the prices that different stores
in a city quote for the same product is roughly proportional to the average price of that product (Pratt,
Wise, & Zeckhauser, 1979). Since the dispersion of
prices is surely controlled by shoppers' efforts to find
the best buy, these results suggest that consumers
hardly exert more effort to save $ 15 on a $ 150 purchase than to save $5 on a $50 purchase.
The topical organization of mental accounts
leads people to evaluate gains and losses in relative
rather than in absolute terms, resulting in large variations in the rate at which money is exchanged for
other things, such as the number of phone calls made
to find a good buy or the willingness to drive a long
distance to get one. Most consumers will find it easier
to buy a car stereo system or a Persian rug, respectively, in the context of buying a car or a house than
separately. These observations, of course, run counter
to the standard rational theory of consumer behavior,
which assumes invariance and does not recognize the
effects of mental accounting.
The following problems illustrate another example of mental accounting in which the posting of
a cost to an account is controlled by topical organization:
Problem 8 (N = 200): Imagine that you have decided to
see a play and paid the admission price of $10 per ticket.
As you enter the theater, you discover that you have lost
the ticket. The seat was not marked, and the ticket cannot
be recovered.
Would you pay $10 for another ticket?
Yes (46%)

No (54%)

Problem 9 (N = 183): Imagine that you have decided to
see a play where admission is $10 per ticket. As you enter
the theater, you discover that you have lost a $10 bill.
Would you still pay $10 for a ticket for the play?
Yes (88%)
No (12%)

The difference between the responses to the two prob347

<-----Page 7----->lems is intriguing. Why are so many people unwilling
to spend $10 after having lost a ticket, if they would
readily spend that sum after losing an equivalent
amount of cash? We attribute the difference to the
topical organization of mental accounts. Going to the
theater is normally viewed as a transaction in which
the cost of the ticket is exchanged for the experience
of seeing the play. Buying a second ticket increases
the cost of seeing the play to a level that many respondents apparently find unacceptable. In contrast,
the loss of the cash is not posted to the account of
the play, and it affects the purchase of a ticket only
by making the individual feel slightly less affluent.
An interesting effect was observed when the two
versions of the problem were presented to the same
subjects. The willingness to replace a lost ticket increased significantly when that problem followed the
lost-cash version. In contrast, the willingness to buy
a ticket after losing cash was not affected by prior
presentation of the other problem. The juxtaposition
of the two problems apparently enabled the subjects
to realize that it makes sense to think of the lost ticket
as lost cash, but not vice versa.
The normative status of the effects of mental
accounting is questionable. Unlike earlier examples,
such as the public health problem, in which the two
versions differed only in form, it can be argued that
the alternative versions of the calculator and ticket
problems differ also in substance. In particular, it
may be more pleasurable to save $5 on a $ 15 purchase
than on a larger purchase, and it may be more annoying to pay twice for the same ticket than to lose
$10 in cash. Regret, frustration, and self-satisfaction
can also be affected by framing (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). If such secondary consequences are considered legitimate, then the observed preferences do
not violate the criterion of invariance and cannot
readily be ruled out as inconsistent or erroneous. On
the other hand, secondary consequences may change
upon reflection. The satisfaction of saving $5 on a
$ 15 item can be marred if the consumer discovers
that she would not have exerted the same effort to
save $10 on a $200 purchase. We do not wish to
recommend that any two decision problems that have
the same primary consequences should be resolved
in the same way. We propose, however, that systematic
examination of alternative framings offers a useful
reflective device that can help decision makers assess
the values that should be attached to the primary and
secondary consequences of their choices.
Losses and Costs
Many decision problems take the form of a choice
between retaining the status quo and accepting an
alternative to it, which is advantageous in some respects and disadvantageous in others. The analysis of
value that was applied earlier to unidimensional risky
348

prospects can be extended to this case by assuming
that the status quo defines the reference level for all
attributes. The advantages of alternative options will
then be evaluated as gains and their disadvantages as
losses. Because losses loom larger than gains, the decision maker will be biased in favor of retaining the
status quo.
Thaler (1980) coined the term "endowment effect" to describe the reluctance of people to part from
assets that belong to their endowment. When it is
more painful to give up an asset than it is pleasurable
to obtain it, buying prices will be significantly lower
than selling prices. That is, the highest price that an
individual will pay to acquire an asset will be smaller
than the minimal compensation that would induce
the same individual to give up that asset, once acquired. Thaler discussed some examples of the endowment effect in the behavior of consumers and
entrepreneurs. Several studies have reported substantial discrepancies between buying and selling prices
in both hypothetical and real transactions (Gregory,
1983; Hammack & Brown, 1974; Knetsch & Sinden,
in press). These results have been presented as challenges to standard economic theory, in which buying
and selling prices coincide except for transaction costs
and effects of wealth. We also observed reluctance to
trade in a study of choices between hypothetical jobs
that differed in weekly salary (S) and in the temperature (T) of the workplace. Our respondents were
asked to imagine that they held a particular position
(S,, T|) and were offered the option of moving to a
different position (S2, T2), which was better in one
respect and worse in another. We found that most
subjects who were assigned to (S1} T,) did not wish
to move to (S2, T2), and that most subjects who were
assigned to the latter position did not wish to move
to the former. Evidently, the same difference in pay
or in working conditions looms larger as a disadvantage than as an advantage.
In general, loss aversion favors stability over
change. Imagine two hedonically identical twins who
find two alternative environments equally attractive.
Imagine further that by force of circumstance the
twins are separated and placed in the two environments. As soon as they adopt their new states as reference points and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each other's environments accordingly,
the twins will no longer be indifferent between the
two states, and both will prefer to stay where they
happen to be. Thus, the instability of preferences
produces a preference for stability. In addition to favoring stability over change, the combination of adaptation and loss aversion provides limited protection
against regret and envy by reducing the attractiveness
of foregone alternatives and of others' endowments.
Loss aversion and the consequent endowment
effect are unlikely to play a significant role in routine

<-----Page 8----->economic exchanges. The owner of a store, for example, does not experience money paid to suppliers
as losses and money received from customers as gains.
Instead, the merchant adds costs and revenues over
some period of time and only evaluates the balance.
Matching debits and credits are effectively cancelled
prior to evaluation. Payments made by consumers
are also not evaluated as losses but as alternative purchases. In accord with standard economic analysis,
money is naturally viewed as a proxy for the goods
and services that it could buy. This mode of evaluation
is made explicit when an individual has in mind a
particular alternative, such as "I can either buy a new
camera or a new tent." In this analysis, a person will
buy a camera if its subjective value exceeds the value
of retaining the money it would cost.
There are cases in which a disadvantage can be
framed either as a cost or as a loss. In particular, the
purchase of insurance can also be framed as a choice
between a sure loss and the risk of a greater loss. In
such cases the cost-loss discrepancy can lead to failures of invariance. Consider, for example, the choice
between a sure loss of $50 and a 25% chance to lose
$200. Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982) reported that 80% of their subjects expressed a riskseeking preference for the gamble over the sure loss.
However, only 35% of subjects refused to pay $50 for
insurance against a 25% risk of losing $200. Similar
results were also reported by Schoemaker and Kunreuther (1979) and by Hershey and Schoemaker
(1980). We suggest that the same amount of money
that was framed as an uncompensated loss in the first
problem was framed as the cost of protection in the
second. The modal preference was reversed in the
two problems because losses are more aversive than
costs.
We have observed a similar effect in the positive
domain, as illustrated by the following pair of problems:
Problem 10: Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10%
chance to win $95 and a 90% chance to lose $5?
Problem 11: Would you pay $5 to participate in a lottery
that offers a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance
to win nothing?

A total of 132 undergraduates answered the two questions, which were separated by a short filler problem.
The order of the questions was reversed for half the
respondents. Although it is easily confirmed that the
two problems offer objectively identical options, 55
of the respondents expressed different preferences in
the two versions. Among them, 42 rejected the gamble
in Problem 10 but accepted the equivalent lottery in
Problem 11. The effectiveness of this seemingly inconsequential manipulation illustrates both the costloss discrepancy and the power of framing. Thinking
April 1984 • American Psychologist

of the $5 as a payment makes the venture more acceptable than thinking of the same amount as a loss.
The preceding analysis implies that an individual's subjective state can be improved by framing
negative outcomes as costs rather than as losses. The
possibility of such psychological manipulations may
explain a paradoxical form of behavior that could be
labeled the dead-loss effect. Thaler (1980) discussed
the example of a man who develops tennis elbow soon
after paying the membership fee in a tennis club and
continues to play in agony to avoid wasting his investment. Assuming that the individual would not
play if he had not paid the membership fee, the question arises: How can playing in agony improve the
individual's lot? Playing in pain, we suggest, maintains
' the evaluation of the membership fee as a cost. If the
individual were to stop playing, he would be forced
to recognize the fee as a dead loss, which may be
more aversive than playing in pain.

Concluding Remarks
The concepts of utility and value are commonly used
in two distinct senses: (a) experience value, the degree
of pleasure or pain, satisfaction or anguish in the
actual experience of an outcome; and (b) decision
value, the contribution of an anticipated outcome to
the overall attractiveness or aversiveness of an option
in a choice. The distinction is rarely explicit in decision theory because it is tacitly assumed that decision
values and experience values coincide. This assumption is part of the conception of an idealized decision
maker who is able to predict future experiences with
perfect accuracy and evaluate options accordingly.
For ordinary decision makers, however, the correspondence of decision values between experience values is far from perfect (March, 1978). Some factors
that affect experience are not easily anticipated, and
some factors that affect decisions do not have a comparable impact on the experience of outcomes.
In contrast to the large amount of research on
decision making, there has been relatively little systematic exploration of the psychophysics that relate
hedonic experience to objective states. The most basic
problem of hedonic psychophysics is the determination of the level of adaptation or aspiration that
separates positive from negative outcomes. The hedonic reference point is largely determined by the
objective status quo, but it is also affected by expectations and social comparisons. An objective improvement can be experienced as a loss, for example,
when an employee receives a smaller raise than everyone else in the office. The experience of pleasure
or pain associated with a change of state is also critically dependent on the dynamics of hedonic adaptation. Brickman & Campbell's (1971) concept of the
hedonic treadmill suggests the radical hypothesis that

349

<-----Page 9----->rapid adaptation will cause the effects of any objective
improvement to be short-lived. The complexity and
subtlety of hedonic experience make it difficult for
the decision maker to anticipate the actual experience
that outcomes will produce. Many a person who ordered a meal when ravenously hungry has admitted
to a big mistake when the fifth course arrived on the
table. The common mismatch of decision values and
experience values introduces an additional element
of uncertainty in many decision problems.
The prevalence of framing effects and violations
of invariance further complicates the relation between
decision values and experience values. The framing
of outcomes often induces decision values that have
no counterpart in actual experience. For example,
the framing of outcomes of therapies for lung cancer
in terms of mortality or survival is unlikely to affect
experience, although it can have a pronounced influence on choice. In other cases, however, the framing
of decisions affects not only decision but experience
as well. For example, the framing of an expenditure
as an uncompensated loss or as the price of insurance
can probably influence the experience of that outcome. In such cases, the evaluation of outcomes in
the context of decisions not only anticipates experience but also molds it.
