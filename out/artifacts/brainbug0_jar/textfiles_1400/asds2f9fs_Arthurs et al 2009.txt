Resource Dependence
Concerns

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by
a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests
are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the
organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types
of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public
offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on
key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board,
greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and
greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

Introduction
Entrepreneurs pursue new opportunities by developing, recombining, and integrating
necessary resources into new configurations which reshape the very patterns of competition (Schumpeter, 1934; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Ideas for new ventures often
emerge from promising insights that entrepreneurs have about the potential for a
new opportunity (Keh, Foo, & Lim, 2002). Such insights usually stem from individual

evolve from these insights, the ventures often develop around the specific skills and
capabilities of the founder(s), intricately linking them to the venture. Accordingly, entrepreneurs frequently represent a key source for the creation of value and the generation
of rents (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001; Barney, 1991).
While having entrepreneurs as a key resource for a venture can clearly be quite
advantageous, it can also create challenges in developing and protecting the firm. Ventures
that have such human capital with firm-specific skills and capabilities have the potential
to turn these intangible resources into sources of competitive advantage (Barney, 1991;
Peteraf, 1993). However, Coff (1999) argues that while a firm may have a competitive
advantage, this advantage may not be reflected in the financial performance of the firm
because the rents of the organization may be diverted first to other stakeholders such as
key personnel with firm-specific capabilities. If indeed a venture has specific resources
capable of generating rents, potential investors will want some assurances that the future
rents of the firm are distributed appropriately.
When individuals are the source of a firm’s competitive advantage, they are in an
advantaged position to negotiate for a greater portion of the value that they generate (Coff,
1999). Oftentimes, managers/entrepreneurs inside the firm will have stronger bargaining
power due to their position (Alvarez & Barney, 2004). Their power is enhanced, in
particular, when they are capable of unified action, have access or control over information, and represent a significant replacement cost to the organization if they should exit
(Coff & Lee, 2003). These criteria are particularly salient in many entrepreneurial ventures. Because entrepreneurial ventures seek to build competitive advantages from innovative pursuits, entrepreneurs and their idiosyncratic knowledge and capabilities can
become central to the venture’s success (Baker, Miner, & Eesley, 2003). Furthermore, the
centrality of entrepreneurs within their venture provides them access and control over
information. Thus, it would seem that entrepreneurs represent both a source for a competitive advantage but also a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated.
Accordingly, we argue that governance is critical in initial public offering (IPO) ventures,
particularly when the entrepreneurs represent a critical resource for the venture. Governance is the set of mechanisms used to manage the relationships among organizational
stakeholders and to establish and control the strategic direction of the firm (Hitt, Ireland,
& Hoskisson, 2007).
The presence of key entrepreneurs raises two central issues facing potential investors
of new ventures with these resources. On the one hand, the investors in such ventures
generally desire to see the key entrepreneurs stay with the venture as the future success
of the venture is closely linked to the capabilities of the entrepreneurs. If they were to exit
the organization, shareholders are likely to suffer significant losses. On the other hand,
individuals with such resources tend to have more bargaining power. Consequently, such
ventures face the challenge of setting up governance mechanisms that both protect future
appropriations for potential shareholders as well as encourage this valuable human capital
to stay with the venture. Both of these issues are often present in entrepreneurial ventures
and they represent an agency concern and a resource-dependence concern, respectively.
As such, the imperative of boards of directors facing these issues is to protect potential
shareholder interests while concomitantly ensuring the retention of the key entrepreneurs
(or at least reducing the impact of any future exit). We argue that the resolution of these
issues involves the establishment of certain protective mechanisms as well as fuller
disclosure of information.
By examining these issues, this research makes the following contributions. First,
with the growing importance of human capital (e.g., Barney & Wright, 1998; Forbes,
846

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->2005; Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001), we develop and test theory on governance in entrepreneurial ventures when there is specific dependence on key entrepreneurs.
Research has recognized the importance of founders–entrepreneurs and governance issues
surrounding their presence (Audretsch & Lehmann, 2005; Nelson, 2003). However, these
studies tend to treat founders as a homogenous group when in fact they are not. We
specifically examine those entrepreneurs with capabilities that are key to the life of the
venture. While governance in IPO ventures is interesting given the uncertainty and
the organizational transition occurring, this human capital dimension helps us to better
understand this dynamic situation; and we believe that properly governing these critical
human actors is likely critical to the success of the venture.
Second, this research addresses the formation of governance mechanisms and the
rationale for those mechanisms in an entrepreneurial context. In preparing for an IPO,
there are a variety of actors such as earlier stage equity investors, underwriters, and of
course key entrepreneurs that shape the governance mechanisms. Such mechanisms are
intended to make the venture more attractive to investors in the IPO market while also
meeting the needs of the pre-IPO stakeholders. Most governance research does little to
consider the various specific actors (Gabrielsson & Huse, 2004; Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson,
& Grossman, 2002). More explicitly, this study probes the types of governance arrangements that are put in place and whether they differ based on the presence of key entrepreneurs. We argue that the presence of key entrepreneurs represents a potentially
non-trivial influence on the mechanisms that are used, both from the position of market
concerns as well as the influence of key entrepreneurs.
In this study, “key entrepreneurs” are individuals with firm-specific skills that are
intimately linked to the financial performance of the venture. We specifically contrast the
governance in those ventures which identify a dependence on one or more key entrepreneurs versus those that do not identify any dependence on critical human capital. As such,
the dependent variable in our study is binary (e.g., dependence on one or more key
entrepreneurs as specified by the venture in the prospectus versus no such dependence).
Also, we use the terms “entrepreneur” and “insider” (common in governance research)
interchangeably. While our data do not allow us to consistently identify which of the key
entrepreneurs are founders, we examine all insiders/entrepreneurs in a governance setting
because this set of individuals is the most important and most involved in bringing new
innovations to the market. In spite of this data limitation, our examination gives us an
important window into how ventures can manage important dependencies.

Governance in the New Venture
This section introduces the rationale for our two theories of focus: agency theory and
resource dependence theory. When financial capital is needed from equity investors such
as business angels and venture capitalists during the initial stages of a venture, governance
arrangements are usually put in place to manage the relationships and to engender
accountability among the various stakeholders (Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, & Taylor,
1993). A board of directors is typically established to monitor and implement governance
mechanisms designed to mitigate behaviors that may not be in the long-term best interest
of the venture. With the raising of additional capital via an IPO, the governance mechanisms often go through substantial changes (Certo, Daily, & Dalton, 2001; Ehrhardt &
Nowak, 2003). Given the new set of shareholders that are joining, it is an appropriate time
to realign the mechanisms with the expectations of potential investors while also catering
to the interests of pre-IPO stakeholders (Eisenhardt, 1989; Fama & Jensen, 1983).
July, 2009

847

<-----Page 3----->Rearrangements can also help to communicate to prospective shareholders that at least
symbolically the venture has addressed some of the normal governance issues (Westphal
& Zajac, 1998). For example, the number of insiders on the board is often reduced to
communicate better governance in preparation for the IPO and perhaps to help “window
dress” the venture (Jenkinson & Ljungqvist, 2002; Lerner, 1994). Ventures seeking to go
public can also signal the value of their firm through the quality of the board members
appointed (Certo, 2003).
The pre-IPO investors want the venture to perform well in the public markets as the
IPO process provides additional capital and provides a means for earlier investors to cash
out (Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2001). Although exploring how the various classes of actors
specifically influence different governance mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study,
we believe that they all have some interrelated involvement in the process (Hoskisson,
Johnson, & Moesel, 1994; Rediker & Seth, 1995). Importantly, the nature of the governance mechanisms established prior to the IPO is fundamentally about aligning the
interests of various current and potential (future) stakeholders in order to attract additional
capital. However, these governance arrangements also vary based on the players that are
involved in the alignment process. And because the presence of key entrepreneurs represents an interesting challenge, we explicitly develop theory to explain how this challenge
is addressed.
In particular, this research compares the governance in those ventures where entrepreneurs are key players of the firm vis-à-vis those ventures where the existence of the
firm is not contingent on any specific entrepreneurial actors. IPO ventures are required to
indicate in the prospectus if they have key personnel that would be difficult to replace and
whose loss would severely impact the organization. As such, we focus on the impact that
this human capital has when it represents some of the unique and central capabilities of
the venture (e.g., they are the key resource of the organization and a source for a potential
competitive advantage as illuminated by Barney, 1991). Agency concerns can be substantial in these ventures due to the increased power that entrepreneurs often wield.
However, mitigating the potential agency problem is not the only concern of the board of
directors. Importantly, the board must ensure that those entrepreneurs that embody firmspecific resources critical to the competitive advantage of the venture are retained. When
key entrepreneurs are present, retaining them usually increases the chances that the
venture will continue to grow and create value for its investors (Martens, Walker, &
Arcand, 2005). Thus, the board must deal simultaneously with both the agency problem
as well as the resource-dependence problem. Mitigating the agency problem will ensure
that investors are provided their share of any rents that are generated. Mitigating the
resource-dependence problem will ensure that rents are able to be generated and
sustained.

Mitigating the Agency Problem
Agency theory provides a rich conceptual foundation to explain what can happen with
a separation of ownership and control and has further provided certain normative prescriptions to deal with the agency problem a priori (Sahlman, 1990; Williamson, 1988).
These mechanisms are intended to more closely align the interests of the management
team and investors and they include incentivizing the agent, bonding the agent, and
monitoring the agent (Eisenhardt, 1989). As a part of the governance process, the central
duty of the board of directors is to oversee the top management team in order to protect
the interests of the shareholders. Within the IPO context, for example, it is possible that
(key) entrepreneurs may expend effort on activities that will enhance their own utility and
848

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->perhaps enable them to exit the venture at the expense of outside investors. We expect to
find the implementation of agency mechanisms to be different in ventures with key
entrepreneurs on their boards versus those without key entrepreneurs.
Agency theorists commonly discuss incentives to encourage agents to act in the best
interest of shareholders (Eisenhardt, 1989; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Managerial compensation is an example of such an incentive. Managerial compensation research indicates
that reward mechanisms can help to align the interests of managers and shareholders
(Barkema & Gomez-Mejia, 1998; Jensen & Murphy, 1990), especially where managers
have a significant impact on the performance of the firm (Miller, Wiseman, & GomezMejia, 2002). Whereas bonding places the entrepreneurs’ wealth at stake and induces goal
alignment because entrepreneurs will not engage in behaviors which would threaten their
own wealth, incentives traditionally induce goal alignment by motivating entrepreneurs
with a potential for gain. Thus, where bonding may encourage entrepreneurs to avoid
certain negative behaviors, incentives encourage entrepreneurs to engage in certain positive behaviors. To this end, stock options, which are a form of contingent compensation,
have been identified as a key incentive for executives particularly in new ventures (Certo,
Daily, Cannella, & Dalton, 2003). Contingent compensation represents future wealth for
the entrepreneurs if they are able to grow the firm after the IPO and increase the stock
price. Indeed, stock options are frequently used in new ventures because they are initially
and oftentimes cheaper than other types of rewards. Furthermore, where ownership in the
venture may promote less risky decision making among the entrepreneurs, stock options
balance this inclination and promote appropriately risky decisions.
Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of contingent compensation are positively associated
with ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.
Agency theory addresses the conflicts of interest that can occur between managers and
owners (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Given that board members are to actively participate
in firm governance, outsider representation on the board of directors has been found to
provide stronger monitoring of the top management team, and thus may lead to superior
performance (Hill & Snell, 1988; Shleifer & Vishny, 1997). More specifically, stronger
monitoring by outsiders can reduce internal agency costs leading to improved firm
performance. However, boards can vary on how much oversight they tend to offer and
the percentage of ownership by outside directors can be a key motivation in providing
ongoing oversight in order to protect the interests of the venture (Kosnik, 1990). Outside
directors with lower levels of equity are likely to be less attentive to problems that may
emerge in the venture (Conyon & Peck, 1998). Furthermore, lower levels of ownership
among outside board members may also signal a lack of independence or a lack of
motivation. Furthermore, lower ownership levels among outside board members may
indicate that their presence is merely symbolic to assuage the concerns of potential
investors. Outside directors with limited ownership may also be more closely aligned with
the entrepreneurs (Schulze, Lubatkin, Dino, & Bucholtz, 2001).
In ventures where key entrepreneurs exist, the presence of strong outside board
members with higher levels of ownership may be particularly valued by potential investors
in the post-IPO era. Key entrepreneurs, while very advantageous for the development of
a competitive advantage, are more likely to need some stronger counterparts on the board
to more effectively implement a check and balance system. Furthermore, such ventures
are likely to have higher levels of information asymmetry. This suggests that the presence
of outside board members, who take their monitoring and oversight of the venture
seriously, becomes particularly important for such ventures. In order to establish and
July, 2009

849

<-----Page 5----->maintain balanced governance, it becomes even more important for outsiders on the board
to involve themselves in governing the venture and to provide stronger oversight.
Hypothesis 2: Higher ownership levels by outsiders on the board of directors are
positively associated with ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.
A key tenet of agency theory is the assumption of information asymmetry between
the principal and agent (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). If the principal were completely
informed, the agent could not engage in acts of opportunism (Eisenhardt, 1989). Indeed,
as the level of information asymmetry between the principal and agent increases, acts of
opportunism become easier and more lucrative because the chance of being caught or
disciplined decreases significantly. Again, we draw attention to the increased information
asymmetry that may occur in ventures dependent on the capabilities of key entrepreneurs
for future success. An entrepreneur with technical knowledge that is on the cutting edge
may be positioned to provide information which is generally unverifiable. If entrepreneurs
make certain claims about the market potential of a developing technology, or if they make
claims about their efforts in bringing new products to market, a board with less experience
is less likely to be able to verify the claims.
Given these issues and earlier research findings, outside board members can be
very important (Sapienza, Manigart, & Vermeir, 1996; Zahra, Neubaum, & Huse, 2000),
particularly in small and medium-sized firms (Huse, 2007). These arguments suggest that
experience among all board members (insiders and outsiders) may be particularly essential
in this context. Ventures with entrepreneurs that have expertise central to the ongoing
development of the venture are also likely to want to have board members who can
understand these entrepreneurs and create some balance on the board. Board members who
have previously been involved in a start-up themselves are likely to be in a better position
to probe some of the more subtle issues the key entrepreneurs face. From a monitoring
perspective, board members with start-up experience are likely to more quickly pick up on
when a key entrepreneur is really working in the long-term best interest of the venture and
when they may be starting to edge toward malfeasance. From a growth and development
standpoint, such board members are likely to understand the context more fully and the
strategic issues which arise, serve as a sounding board to the entrepreneurs, and guide and
defend future resource allocations more carefully. Overall, experienced board members
should reduce the board’s level of information asymmetry. Thus, we argue that start-up
experience with new ventures among board members will be particularly useful. Such
experience is perhaps one reason why venture capitalists are usually associated with better
governance (cf. Amit, Brander, & Zott, 1998; Rosenstein et al., 1993; Sapienza et al.).
Hypothesis 3: Higher start-up experience among members on the board of directors
is positively associated with ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.

Mitigating the Resource Dependence Problem
Most research examining the role of boards from a resource-dependence perspective
views the board as providing access to essential resources from the external environment
(Hillman & Dalziel, 2003; Hillman, Cannella, & Paetzold, 2000) as a means to manage
the organization’s dependence and reduce environmental uncertainty (Pfeffer & Salancik,
1978). This includes reducing the transaction costs associated with garnering those
resources from the environment (Pfeffer & Salancik; Williamson, 1985). However, this
dichotomy of external versus internal resources may be inappropriate when considering
human assets which cannot be owned by the company (Coff, 1997). By viewing the
850

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->firm as a nexus of contracts (Coff, 1997, 1999; Jensen & Meckling, 1976), the distinction
between internal and external resources tends to apply perhaps only to non-human assets
such as capital, equipment, land, patents, trademarks, and the like. Whereas the nonhuman assets cannot decide to exit the firm, human agents have the freedom and discretion
to leave the organization. As such, the board must also manage dependency on the
organization’s human assets as well even if these assets are currently employed by the
organization (Westphal & Zajac, 1998).
Whereas mitigating the agency problem will ensure that a portion of any future rents
will flow to shareholders, mitigating the resource dependence problem will increase the
likelihood that rents are generated in the first place. That is, in those ventures dependent
on the capabilities of key entrepreneurs for future survival and success, retaining the
entrepreneurs as active employees is likely to be critical. This dependence may have arisen
due to the cognition of the entrepreneurs (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001; Busenitz & Barney,
1997) or the expertise of the entrepreneurs which would make them rarer, potentially more
valuable, and much more costly to replace (Barney, 1991). As such, keeping this expertise
in the organization is likely a high priority and a goal of the board of directors. Indeed,
Boeker and Karichalil (2002) observed that founders working in research and development functions were less likely to leave their new venture. Even though many new
ventures may be constrained by a paucity of resources (Baker & Nelson, 2005), expending
additional resources by extending a voluntary departure or employment agreement to
important entrepreneurs may serve the interests of investors. An employment agreement
often prevents an entrepreneur from working in the same industry if he or she were to
leave the organization voluntarily. As such, the employment agreement should motivate
the entrepreneurs with critical firm-specific capital to stay with the organization. At the
very least, these agreements prevent this firm-specific capital from being employed in
other competitor firms.
Hypothesis 4: Greater use of voluntary departure (employment) agreements is
positively associated with ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.
As noted above, a central responsibility of the board of directors is to reduce dependencies and uncertainty. As such, the use of an employment agreement ties entrepreneurs
to the organization and ensures that the skills critical to the organization’s future success
remain with the organization. An employment agreement is useful because it prohibits the
voluntary exit of critical firm-specific human capital. It therefore allows the organization
(e.g., shareholders) to capture the rents generated by the entrepreneur because it creates
costs for the entrepreneur to leave the venture. In addition to reducing the likelihood that
a key entrepreneur will depart the organization voluntarily, the board must reduce the cost
of an entrepreneur departing the organization involuntarily such as through an untimely
death. That is, the more specific and the more critical the skills and capabilities of the
entrepreneur are to the venture, the more likely it is that the board will make arrangements
to help buffer an involuntary departure. Such arrangements are likely to be received
positively by the market as well (Westphal & Zajac, 1998). In the event of an untimely and
involuntary departure, the board would be responsible for finding a replacement with a
similar skill set of capabilities. A life insurance policy on key entrepreneurs that provides
the venture with money needed for just such an occurrence is the involuntary departure
agreement we focus on here.
Hypothesis 5: Greater use of involuntary departure agreements is positively associated with ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.
July, 2009

851

<-----Page 7----->The final element which may be used to ensure the ongoing involvement of entrepreneurs in their venture is the lockup agreement. The lockup agreement is an agreement
wherein the pre-IPO shareholders in the organization promise not to sell or disperse any
of their shares for a specified period of time after the IPO (Bradley, Jordan, Yi, & Roten,
2001). According to Field and Hanka (2001), lockups act as a signal to investors that key
employees will remain with the firm for a period of time and further signal that insiders
are not seeking to cash out in advance of imminent bad news. While many lockup
agreements are 180 days, pre-IPO owners often extend their lockup period to signal
stability in the face of uncertainty. We test whether those ventures specifying dependence
on key entrepreneurs will seek to alleviate retention concerns with key entrepreneurs
through longer lockup periods.
Hypothesis 6: The length of the average lockup period is positively associated with
ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs.

Methodology
Sample
To test the hypotheses, we created a sample of ventures that had gone through an
initial IPO between 1990 and 1994. Given that IPO markets experience major fluctuations
and assuming that there is no such thing as a “typical” IPO year (Beatty & Zajac, 1994), the
time frame selected spans multiple years while also omitting the more extreme ends of
the IPO market. Our sampling frame was comprised of 422 firms in technology-based
industries that went through an IPO in the U.S. market during this timeframe as identified
through the New Issues database produced by Thomson Financial. The prospectuses of
each firm, released just prior to the IPO, provided the information in this study for all
independent variables. Firms with fewer than 10 employees were eliminated. Owing to
their very small size, they may behave differently from most IPO firms or be affected by
different dynamics. Missing data within the prospectuses as well as firms going through a
seasoned equity offering improperly identified in the New Issues database as IPOs as well
as those going through a leveraged buyout (LBO) were further eliminated, thereby reducing
the sample size to 313 firms. Two of the firms in the sample were missing information
on two of the variables. We ran analyses with imputed variables and without. The results for
all of our hypotheses were unchanged so we include the two firms in the analyses.

Measures
The dependent variable is a binomial variable indicating dependence on a key entrepreneur or entrepreneurs for future survival and success. As a part of the IPO process and
the filing of the prospectus, a venture must identify and enumerate the key risks that
potential investors may face. Some ventures’ prospectuses indicate that they are dependent on key personnel, whereas others do not identify such dependence as a key risk.
When dependence was specified in the prospectus, the venture was coded “1.” Those
ventures not specifying dependence were coded “0.” As a sampling of our data, under the
heading of “Dependence on Key Personnel,” one prospectus stated “The Company is
highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific and management staff, the loss
of whose services might impede the achievement of its research and development or
strategic objectives.” Another prospectus was more specific: “The Company’s success to
date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of its founders (four named
852

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->individuals specifically stated) and the loss of the services of one or more of them could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and
financial condition. None of such persons has an employment or non-competition agreement with the Company.”
The independent variables in this study were obtained from the prospectus of each
venture. Consistent with previous studies, contingent pay was operationalized as the value
of stock options before the IPO logged to reduce skewness (Certo et al., 2003). Inside
directors are members of the board of directors who are current firm employees. Based on
prior research (Daily & Dalton, 1994), we defined affiliated outside directors using SEC
regulation 14A, Item 6(b), where affiliated directors include relatives, customers, suppliers, former employees, lawyers, and bankers. Affiliated outside directors were removed
from the sample as they may not have the same incentives as or objectivity of true
independent outside directors (Daily & Dalton; Johnson, Hoskisson, & Hitt, 1993). The
remaining outside directors were classified as independent outside directors in that they
have no other affiliation with the firm except as directors. Outsider equity was operationalized as the total equity owned by independent outsiders serving on the board of directors
divided by the total equity of the new venture.
Start-up experience represents the total number of start-up ventures that directors (both
inside and outside) have been involved with previously. In order to reduce skewness in the
variable, it was calculated as the log of one plus the total number of start-ups. We ran
the results without logging them and got similar results. Voluntary departure agreements
were measured by looking at the presence of employment agreements. We have termed the
employment agreements as “voluntary” to communicate how the intent of these agreements
is to create a burden on the key entrepreneurs should they leave voluntarily (on their own
accord). We also use this terminology in order to delineate it from the life insurance (e.g.,
“involuntary departure agreements”). While most prospectuses do not detail the substance
of the employment agreements, when we did find prospectuses that talked about them, they
proscribed an individual from working in the same industry for a period of time if he/she
should voluntarily leave the organization. The use of employment agreements was similarly
coded as the log of one plus the total number of employment agreements used by the new
venture. Again, we ran the results without logging them and got similar results. Additionally, involuntary departure agreements were measured by examining the presence of life
insurance policies on key entrepreneurs. The use of life insurance policies was also coded
as the log of one plus the total number of life insurance policies used by the new venture.
Finally, the lockup period was calculated as the weighted average of the number of days that
a share agreement is in effect logged to reduce skewness. We settled on a weighted average
of the lockup period because it best reflects the impact of the lockup period and it is the most
fine-grained measure available. Prior research in finance has tended to use 180 days as the
lockup period. Unfortunately, there are several separate lockup periods in many IPO firms
so that the use of a single lockup period would be inappropriate. Also, the use of a dummy
variable to indicate a lockup longer than 180 days would be inappropriate as well because
some firms may maintain a lockup of 210 or 240 days whereas others maintain a lockup of
1 year or even longer.
Several control variables were used in the study in order to rule out alternative
explanations for the governance patterns. We controlled for both the age of the firm in
years from the date of founding to the time of the IPO as well as the size of the firm.
Consistent with previous studies in entrepreneurship, size was coded as the log of the
total number of employees. This study also wanted to hold constant the influence that
underwriters and venture capitalists may have on specific ventures. For example, venture
capitalists often help to credential a venture going through an IPO perhaps partially
July, 2009

853

<-----Page 9----->substituting for things like board experience and lockup period length. Because board
size can have a significant impact on IPO firms and investors’ perceptions (Certo, 2003),
the total number of directors was controlled for. Because excessive use of contingent
compensation can induce too much risk-taking by entrepreneurs, the use of noncontingent
compensation puts a delimiter on excessive risk-taking. As such, we controlled for the
amount of noncontingent compensation (e.g., salary) and logged the value to reduce
skewness. Additionally, we controlled for firm performance using return on assets in the
year prior to the IPO. Those firms with poorer performance may be even more dependent
on key entrepreneurs. Additionally, we sought to control for the research and development
(R&D) intensity of the new venture because greater R&D intensity may be associated
with greater dependence on the skills of the entrepreneurs. R&D intensity was coded as
the total amount spent on R&D in the year prior to the IPO divided by the total employees.
Because we utilize the lockup period as one of our independent variables, we wanted to
control for the total amount of shares locked up after the IPO. Fewer locked shares would
have less of an impact. The percentage of locked shares was calculated as the total number
of shares part of the lockup agreement divided by the total number of shares outstanding
after the IPO. Additionally, we sought to control for the existence of a founder with the
organization. A founder would likely exert greater control over the governance mechanisms extant in the organization. As such, we coded the organization “1” if a founder was
still part of the new venture and “0” otherwise. We also controlled for insider equity as
individuals critical to their firm’s success will tend to have higher levels of ownership.
Insider equity was operationalized as the total equity owned by insiders divided by the
total equity of the new venture. Lastly, we controlled for industry and temporal effects.
We used a dummy variable for the 2-digit SIC code of the new venture. Furthermore, we
controlled for the number of IPOs floated each year in our sample.

Results
We used bivariate and binomial logistic regression to examine the hypotheses. Table 1
provides the mean, standard deviation, and correlations among all variables. The average
number of employees in our sample firms is 315 with a range from 10 to 8,600. The mean
board size is 5.86. The insider average is 2.29, independent outsider average is 3.04, and
the number of affiliated outsiders is 0.53 (and was not included in our outsider ratio as we
noted above).
Table 2 presents the results for the hypotheses. Overall, model fit was excellent in
that the final model correctly classified 84.7% of the cases. In addition, the results of a
Hosmer–Lemeshow test (which tests how well the model fits the data), was not significant.
A nonsignificant chi-square value indicates the model has adequate fit. Hypothesis 1
proposed that ventures dependent on key entrepreneurs would resort to increased contingent compensation as a means to align interests between the entrepreneurs and potential
shareholders. The coefficient for this variable is positive and significant (p < .05) in
support of this hypothesis. Hypothesis 2 proposed a positive relationship between outsider
equity and dependence on key entrepreneurs. The coefficient for this variable is marginally significant in the second regression (p = .053), which is approaching traditional levels
of significance. Given our sample size, we are somewhat surprised at this result because
the zero-order correlation between outsider equity and dependence on key entrepreneurs
is significant (r = .16). There is some indication that dependency motivates greater equity
ownership among those who would oversee the top management team, consistent with
agency theory predictions. We will address this issue further in the Discussion and

Implications section. The last agency variable, start-up experience among board members,
was expected to act as greater experience (and information) and therefore would be
positively related to dependence on key entrepreneurs. Greater experience would inherently reduce the information asymmetry for the board. The coefficient for this variable
is positive and significant (p < .01), supporting hypothesis 3.
Hypothesis 4 proposed a positive relationship between the use of voluntary departure
agreements (employment agreements) for top management and dependence on key entrepreneurs. This variable was not significant. Hypothesis 5 proposed a positive relationship
between the use of involuntary departure agreements (life insurance policies) and dependence on key entrepreneurs. The coefficient for this variable is positive and significant
(p < .05), supporting this hypothesis. Lastly, hypothesis 6 proposed a positive relationship
between the length of the lockup period and dependence on key entrepreneurs. Although
the zero-order coefficient is positive and significant, it is not significant once the controls
are accounted for. Thus, hypothesis 6 is not supported.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->After performing the logistic regression, we conducted a casewise listing of the
residuals. This provided a listing of those cases with studentized residuals greater than 2.0.
There were 13 such cases. We then obtained the DfBeta statistic to indicate cases which
are poorly fitted by the model. It measures the change in the logit coefficients for a given
variable when a case is dropped. A DfBeta statistic for each case for each explanatory
variable was then calculated and used in the model. While there is no theoretical guidance
as to what the cutoff criterion should be in determining outliers, we used a generally
accepted cutoff criterion as those with a dbeta >1.0 on critical variables in the model. After
removing cases with dbeta’s >1.0, results of subsequent analysis indicate improved overall
model fit. This increased the levels of significance for nearly all of the independent variables
that were originally significant, but did not affect the variables that were not significant.
For example, outsider equity became significant at p < .05. Also, contingent compensation
became significant at p < .01 and involuntary departure agreement became significant at
p < .01. So overall, the residual analysis provided greater support for our results although
we report the results without the residual analysis as they are more conservative.

Discussion and Implications
In general, we find partial support for our arguments. The findings of this study
generally indicate that dependence on key entrepreneurs is an important issue within
newer ventures. Consistent with our theoretical arguments, it seems that dependence on
key entrepreneurs motivates a greater concern for reducing the potential agency problem
and the potential resource-dependence problem. More specifically, ownership of outsiders
on the board is higher when the organization is dependent on key entrepreneurs. This
higher ownership is interesting because it would tend to promote stronger monitoring by
these board members. The importance here is that outsiders will provide greater dispassionate oversight whereas insiders will provide greater access to strategic information
that will be relevant for guiding the firm (Baysinger & Hoskisson, 1990; Zahra, 1996). The
fact that the outsider equity relationship is only marginally significant might suggest
that this relationship is not terribly strong or that there is substitution or overlapping
effects between the various governance devices (cf. Rediker & Seth, 1995). For example,
the correlation between outsider equity and the presence of venture capital (VC) backing
is 0.47, indicating that VC ownership in all likelihood is absorbing some of the influence
here. Furthermore, outsider and insider equity are negatively and significantly correlated
(r = -.40) and outsider equity and outsider ratio are positively correlated (r = .46). These
relationships suggest that individual governance devices represent a system of governance
where one governance device might substitute for another (Hoskisson et al., 1994). Future
research could disentangle the involvement of VCs, for example, examining the larger
equity positions that they typically obtain and how they tend to manage entrepreneurs who
possess valuable human capital.
Additionally, we found that contingent compensation was higher in those ventures
exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs. This would tend to suggest a desire for
greater goal alignment between top management and potential shareholders also consistent with agency theory prescriptions. A key tenet of agency theory is that an agency
problem cannot exist without information asymmetry (Eisenhardt, 1989) and that greater
information among the board aids in mitigating any potential agency problem. To this
end, our use of previous start-up experience provided a measure of knowledge that
would likely prove invaluable in this context. It comes as no surprise that this previous
experience proved significant.

<-----Page 13----->Regarding the resource-dependence hypotheses, the greater use of involuntary departure agreements among those ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs indicates that the involuntary loss of any of the entrepreneurs would prove extremely difficult.
The strong results here clearly support our central thesis that key entrepreneurs with their
firm-specific skills and capabilities are critical to the life of a venture; so much so that an
untimely departure of a key entrepreneur would likely result in a major setback to the
venture. Those overseeing these ventures are putting into place insurance policies that can
help provide some added resources in the unlikely event that one of these key entrepreneurs experiences an untimely departure.
The voluntary departure agreement was not significant. It may be that other mechanisms are better predictors of keeping key entrepreneurs fully engaged and motivated. For
example, if key entrepreneurs are also founders or they are intimately involved with one
or more patents on behalf of the venture, they may already feel a strong tie to the venture,
sometimes referred to as psychological ownership (Pierce, Kostova, & Dirks, 2001).
Psychological ownership has reference to a condition in which an individual thinks and
feels that the target or some part of that target of ownership is his or hers (Pierce, Van
Dyne, & Cummings, 1992). Such ownership is likely to give rise to the investment of
oneself into the entity or organization. Such investments can take many forms including,
“investment of one’s time; ideas; skills; and physical, psychological, and intellectual
energies. As a result, the individual may begin to feel that the target of ownership flows
from the self” (Pierce et al., 2001, p. 302). Thus, when psychological ownership is
present, formal contracts such as employment agreements may not be necessary. While
psychological ownership is relatively new to the management domain and has yet to be
examined extensively in entrepreneurship research, we think that it may well have much
potential in explaining governance systems in entrepreneurial ventures involving founders
and key entrepreneurs. In one of the first important studies introducing psychological
ownership to entrepreneurship research, Wasserman (2006) found that entrepreneurial
ventures with founders tend to enjoy lower compensation costs. This “founder discount”
though appears to disappear as organizations mature and grow. We see this research as
complementary and believe that taking into account psychological factors may be important for understanding governance in entrepreneurial ventures.
While little research has also been conducted with lockup periods, we thought that
a longer lockup period might help send the signal that retention concerns have been
alleviated. While we did not find significance here, it appears that the lockup period
has some interesting correlations with venture capital and underwriter involvement. It
is possible that venture capital backing may partially explain the lack of significance.
Venture capitalists are widely recognized as experts in governing new ventures (e.g., Amit
et al., 1998; Gorman & Sahlman, 1989). As such, they may provide greater protection
against resource dependence problems. For example, venture capitalists often establish
critical ties with other organizations (Megginson & Weiss, 1991), which may provide their
funded ventures with access to resources not otherwise available. This in turn may act as
a delimiter on the amount of risk faced by the organization.

Future Research Opportunities
We believe our results are important for the field of entrepreneurship. Our examination here has focused on the governance that arises in pre-IPO ventures. This context is
inherently interesting for rent appropriation theory because it represents a situation where
potential investors must be induced to invest. Therefore, the governance arising in these
ventures is likely much more dynamic than that found in older, established organizations.
858

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->We believe future research should seek to establish how the governance changes over time
especially in those ventures dependent on key entrepreneurs. From a resource-dependence
perspective, it would seem important to observe the hiring patterns in the organizations to
understand whether actions are taken to abate this dependence over time. When there is a
substantial dependence on key entrepreneurs, it seems that at some point it will become
important to diffuse the knowledge representing those unique managerial skills across the
organization perhaps through specialization. Whether there are inducements given to
those critical entrepreneurs to foster such skill transfer by the organization beyond the
compensation evidence that we provide is left for future research.
With the attention of this study on the role of human capital in entrepreneurial
ventures, it seems apparent that there is a place for human resource management such as
with the diffusion of knowledge just mentioned. The management of human resources
in IPO firms has been found to have a positive relationship to performance (Cyr, Johnson,
& Welbourne, 2000). However, this study brings to light the importance and impact of
firm-specific human resources, rather than the impact of more generic measures of human
capital (e.g., education or experience). We believe other specific types of human capital
should be examined, possibly focusing on whether different types of firm-specific human
capital arise at different times in the life of the new venture. Also, while firm-specific
human capital resources can clearly be quite advantageous, what are the implications of
this for the entire human resources of the firm? Are other less-important actors in the same
organization treated differently? If so, we think there may arise some important issues
concerning fairness and transparency in human resource practices that may be exacerbated over time. If diffusion of knowledge is a goal among strategic decision makers then
it would seem important to implement training and compensation practices which reduced
overall turnover in order to retain this knowledge in the organization. So in the end, there
may be a trickle-down effect in some organizations with important firm-specific human
capital such that the overall level of compensation and benefits is higher vis-à-vis other
firms in an industry. On the other hand, there may be some organizations that develop a
caste-like organization where less important members are treated generally poorly vis-àvis the important members in the organization. While examining these questions is beyond
the scope of this paper, we believe that the IPO practices may have a direct bearing on
human resource strategy later on in the life of the organization and therefore present an
excellent research opportunity. Lastly, we think that understanding how a team of entrepreneurs would be governed with the added issue of social complexity versus governance
of key individual entrepreneurs (as was the focus of our study) would provide important
insights for future research.
From an agency theory perspective, it seems important to observe how the board
membership changes over time (e.g., Lynall, Golden, & Hillman, 2003). We find that
start-up experience is important initially. Over time, it would seem important to bring in
other directors with different experience as the new venture matures and develops. We
believe the makeup of the board will change to reflect the changing competitive situation
facing the organization. A critical question in light of rent appropriation theory is whether
changing board membership creates a situation where critical top managers are able to
build their power. Does the transition of certain members from the board allow the
development of entrenchment among the top management team? We believe an opportunity exists to probe this issue further.
Another area that future research could pursue is the process by which the governance
mechanisms that these IPO firms have are put into place. This study has assumed that the
established governance mechanisms of the studied IPO ventures reflect the common
concerns that investors tend to have. However, these governance arrangements do not
July, 2009

859

<-----Page 15----->just suddenly emerge from a vacuum. Rather, multiple human actors have usually been
involved. The founding entrepreneurs frequently put a board of directors into place during
the early phases of the venture. When a venture raises outside capital, equity investors
usually demand one or more seats on the board of directors, so if a venture does not have
a board of directors prior to the raising of outside capital, they will put one into place at
that time.
Furthermore, boards of directors are not permanent once they are in place. Particularly
in anticipation of an IPO, a board will often be adjusted. So the establishment of these
governance mechanisms is a dynamic and evolving process. While the founders make
the initial impact, different types of investors (e.g., business angels, VCs, corporations)
will undoubtedly make their presence and governance concerns reflected in the venture as
well. Finally, in preparation for the IPO, it is likely that the underwriters also make their
concerns known since they want the firm to appeal to outside investors. In sum, it seems
that the influences of these various actors in the evolution of a venture’s governance
system could make for an interesting study.

Limitations
Given that this study is not without limitations, the following discussion addresses
three areas in particular: the dependence on key entrepreneurs, the human actors in putting
the discussed governance arrangements into place, and the time context of this study.
These areas also provide opportunities for follow-on research.
As previously specified, the data for our dependence on key entrepreneurs is a
binomial variable based on the provided information in the IPO prospectus. While this
study represents a constructive first take on these data, further inquiry and development of
this variable could be very enriching. The prospectuses generally do not provide detailed
information about this dependence and the specific individual(s) associated with this
dependence. For example, it would be interesting to explore if this dependence sometimes
involves more than one individual and the background of the key entrepreneurs. Are they
always founders, did this dependence coincide with the development of the firm, or did
they bring their expertise into the venture? Furthermore, there is undoubtedly variance
in the degree to which a venture depends on their key entrepreneurs. Some skills and
capabilities are undoubtedly going to be worth more than others and will be harder to
imitate. It appears that this could be an exciting domain for future research to further probe
this important area.
Generalizability concerns are important for most empirical studies including this one.
Our sample period involves a fair amount of variation in economic activity (just preceding
the Internet bubble and the concomitant explosion in IPOs). The years of our sample
ranged from the relatively slow year of 1990 to the more active years of the mid-1990s
prior to the bubble years of the late 1990s, giving this study good generalizability. We
suggest that our results are consistent with the assumption that governance concerns
among potential investors are relatively consistent across time, although ultimately this
remains an empirical question. Given the cyclical nature of the IPO market and given
that our sample represents a “middle ground” era, the question obviously emerges as
to whether the governance issues surrounding the role of the key entrepreneurs is likely to
vary at the higher and lower extremes of the market. While future research could certainly
examine the findings of this study across the full range of the IPO market cycles, we
suspect that the need for entrepreneurs with specific skills and capabilities remains largely
stable across time as does the need for appropriate governance mechanisms to assuage
investor concerns. In sum, while limitations exist with our 1990–1994 sample of IPO
860

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->ventures, we think that our findings represent reasonable generalizability, particularly in
light of the cyclical nature of the IPO market.

Practical Implications
It seems intuitive for an entrepreneurial venture to move toward the utilization of
specific resources and to endure dependence on key entrepreneurs when the represented
skills and capabilities are germane to the commercialization of the venture. It is from such
idiosyncratic resources that sources of competitive advantage often emerge (Barney, 1991;
Peteraf, 1993). However, the implications of this study suggest that such resources need
to be managed and that there are downside risks associated with these skills and capabilities. Stated differently, sometimes a venture’s greatest asset can also become its
greatest weakness so appropriate governance mechanisms need to be in place to give the
venture its best chance for success.
The findings from this study indicate that the presence of dependence on key entrepreneurs tends to be managed by incentivizing them through greater use of contingent
compensation, and by monitoring them more effectively through outside ownership and
by improved monitoring through more start-up experience. Whereas the incentivizing
mechanisms are typically found in other agency theoretic research, the start-up experience
is an interesting monitoring mechanism which we have not seen in prior studies. Yet this
start-up experience is likely most precious for assuaging investor concerns. Furthermore,
we suspect that start-up experience among prestigious board members (such as VCs) will
be even more efficacious in that these board members are protective of their reputation.
Accordingly, we believe that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs may
be able to signal effective governance by populating the board with certain outsiders
(cf. Certo, 2003).
As previously discussed, it is likely that a variety of human actors get involved in
establishing the appropriate governance arrangements. The findings of this study offer
some insights into what mechanisms are important for those ventures with entrepreneurs
involving key dependencies (e.g., outsider equity, contingent compensation, start-up experience, and involuntary departure agreements). This could be particularly significant for
those who have little experience with putting into place governance arrangements. The
signals from this study suggest that voluntary departure agreements and the lockup period
offer no significant help with managing such dependencies.
