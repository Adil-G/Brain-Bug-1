Venture capitalists’ decision-making in small equity
markets: a case study using participant observation
JORGE SILVA
(Final version accepted 13 February 2004)
Despite signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture capital decisionmaking process, the dimension and maturity of equity market has not yet been considered as
an important contextual factor. Aiming at developing an understanding on how venture
capitalists (VCs) select early-stage projects in small equity markets, a pilot study using
participant observation technique has been conducted in a Portuguese venture capital ﬁrm.
The ﬁndings indicate that the decision-making process and the criteria used by VCs in this
market context differ signiﬁcantly from those used in the developed equity markets.
Regarding the decision-making process as a whole, it appears to be more interactive than
usually portrayed in previous models. Moreover, some of the activities take place
simultaneously, rather than sequentially. In particular, relevant differences were found in
deal origination, deal evaluation and closing phase. Regarding the decision-making criteria
applied, the ﬁndings of this case study are in accordance to previous studies and suggest that
the attention of VCs is very focused on entrepreneur(s). The business idea, its sustainable
advantages and growth potential are also considered important but, contrarily to previous
literature, ﬁnancial projections do not seem to play a major role in the selection of earlystage projects.

Keywords: decision-making process; venture capital; small equity markets; participantobservation

Introduction
Describing and understanding the venture capitalists’ decision-making
process has been the goal of a large number of academic researchers since
the 1970s. The interest in this particular topic is bound to a variety of
purposes: from verifying ‘whether venture capital market allocates
resources properly’ (Fried and Hisrich 1994: 28), to helping venture
capitalists to better understand their own decision making process, which,
in turn, provides the opportunity to increase evaluation efﬁciency
(Shepherd 1999), to aiding entrepreneurs in obtaining funds (Timmons
and Gumpert 1982).
Despite signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture
capitalists decision-making process, the maturity of private equity market

as an important contextual factor has not yet been considered. Aimed at
developing an understanding on how venture capitalists (VCs) select earlystage investments in small equity markets, this article reports on the
ﬁndings of an exploratory project that analyses the VCs’ decision-making
process of a Portuguese venture capital ﬁrm (VCF). The article proceeds as
follows: ﬁrst, the literature on VCs decision-making process is reviewed.
Then, the limitations of previous studies are presented. Thereafter, the
methodology adopted is explained, followed by the description of the case.
Finally, results of the pilot study are presented and discussed.
Research on venture capitalists’ decision-making process
The existing research on VCs’ decision-making process can be classiﬁed
into two broad streams: one is processual research—i.e. research focusing on
the course of events and activities that constitute the VCs’ decision-making
process (e.g. Wells 1974, Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, Silver 1985, Hall
1989)—and the other is criteria research, i.e. research focusing on the
criteria used by VCs when assessing proposals (e.g. Poindexter 1976,
MacMillan et al. 1985, Khan 1987). While most of the studies can be
positioned within one or the other research stream, some represent a
combination of the two, having produced models outlining the phases of
the decision-making process and the criteria used in each phase (e.g. Wells
1974, Boocock and Woods 1997). Table 1 summarizes some of the previous
studies published in this area of research.
The processual stream of research initiated with the study by Wells
(1974) has produced several models aiming at describing the decisionmaking process. Table 2 presents the various phases of investment process
identiﬁed in these studies. As referred by Hall and Hofer (1993: 29) the
most relevant facts revealed by the studies and agreed by all the researchers
are: (1) that the process consists in multiple phases and (2) that the venture
evaluation itself involves at least two phases – screening and evaluation.
With regard to criteria research, there is signiﬁcant number and variety
of studies. The ﬁrst wave of studies focused on asking VCs for criteria
commonly used in assessing proposals. As a result, a weighted list (Wells
1974) or a ranked list (e.g. Poindexter 1976) of criteria was obtained. Wells
(1974) found that VCs consider management commitment as the criterion
having the highest weight in assessment of proposals. This criterion was
closely followed by product, market and marketing skills. The results of
Poindexter’s study identify the quality of management as the criterion with
the highest rank in the opinion of VCs followed by expected rate of return
and expected risk. Tyebjee and Bruno (1981) found management skills as
the most important factor. The study by MacMillan et al. (1985) reveals
that ﬁve of 10 most important criteria were related to entrepreneur’s
experience or personality.
Since that ﬁrst wave of studies on VCs’ decision-making process, a
signiﬁcant number of subsequent studies have enriched the existing
knowledge by using different methodological approaches. One group of
researchers have conducted studies that attempted to validate the VCs’

selection criteria. MacMillan et al. (1987) represents one of the ﬁrst
attempts to test, if the criteria identiﬁed in previous studies (mainly in
MacMillan et al. 1985) were indeed helpful to distinguish between
successful and unsuccessful ventures. An important ﬁnding of their study,
identiﬁed through regression analysis, was that the two major criteria
predictors of venture success are: ‘(1) the extent to which the venture is
initially insulated from competition and (2) the degree to which there is
demonstrated market acceptance of the product’ (MacMillan et al. 1997:
124). Khan (1987) also conducted research in this area, but adopted a
different approach. He used two types of non-compensatory actuarial
models—conjunctive and disjunctive—to model both VCs’ judgement and
the environment (the actual outcome of ventures). The results showed that
VCs give emphasis to the entrepreneurs’ desire to succeed and the
uniqueness of the product as essential variable in arriving at their
judgement. This study also suggests that VCs’ judgements are poor
predictors of actual outcomes and that derived models outperform VCs’
judgements.
Another group of researchers have applied real-time data gathering
methods to solve the possible introspection biases associated with the
methods used in previous studies. One of the methods introduced was
verbal protocols, a method that consists in asking the research
participants to ‘think aloud’, i.e. verbalize their thoughts as they
perform a particular task (see Ericsson and Simon 1984). Sandberg et
al. (1988) tested the applicability of this method in one VCF. Hall and
Hofer (1993) conducted a more extensive verbal protocol research with
four VCF and 16 protocols. The results of this study suggested that in
the initial proposal screening, the most important criteria were the ﬁt
with the venture ﬁrm’s lending policy and the long term growth and
proﬁtability of the industry. In the next phase of the proposal
assessment, the source of the business proposal was also considered
important. Contrarily to the previous ﬁndings, this study suggested that
VCs do not attribute signiﬁcant importance to the entrepreneur(s) and
the business strategy, at least not in the early phases of the decisionmaking process.
The other real-time data gathering method used in recent studies is
experiments. This method was essentially used to collect data in order
to perform conjoint analysis (e.g. Riquelme and Rickards 1992,
Muzyka et al. 1996, Shepherd 1999). The goal of conjoint analysis is
to capture quantitatively the relative importance of a list of attributes
set against each other (Muzyka et al. 1996: 276). Riquelme and
Rickards (1992) in their study conﬁrmed the emphasis VCs placed on
the entrepreneur’s experience. A subsequent study conducted by
Muzyka et al. (1996) used a variation of the same technique (tradeoffs) to analyse 35 criteria and found that all ﬁve management team
criteria were positioned in the top of the ranking. These criteria were
(1) leadership potential of the lead entrepreneur; (2) leadership
potential of the management team; (3) existence of recognized industry
expertise in team; (4) track record of the lead entrepreneur and (5)
track record of the management team.

Limitations of previous studies
The previous studies revised above present two types of major limitations
in uncovering the VCF’s decision-making process: the ﬁrst is bound to data
collection methods adopted, while the second is associated with the
research context where those studies were conducted. Regarding data
collection methodology, as referred by several authors (Sandberg et al.
1988, Hall and Hofer 1993, Shepherd 1999), most of the existing studies
present limitations associated with retrospective reporting (e.g. Tyebjee
and Bruno 1984), questionnaire responses rather than actual evaluations
(e.g. Poindexter 1976, MacMillan et al. 1985), and self-reporting (e.g.
MacMillan et al. 1987). Some studies have attempted to address these
problems by using alternative approaches to gather empirical evidence,
e.g., taping verbal protocols (see, Sandberg et al. 1988, Hall and Hofer
1993), searching out private documents of the ﬁrm (Boocock and Woods
1997) or conducting experiments (e.g. Zacharakis and Meyer 1998).
Despite their signiﬁcant contribution, these approaches remain limited.
In the case of verbal protocols, the limitation concerns reliance only on selfreported data. In the case of archival search, its limitation results from the
fact that it captures only the outputs of the process. The experiments as a
methodological approach is also limited, in particular, due to the fact that it
relies on hypothetical ventures and environments, rather than on actual
proposals, and uses previously deﬁned, therefore restricted, number of
attributes to be assessed by the VCs.
Regarding the research context, while most of the past studies have
analysed the VCs’ decision-making process in large and developed private
equity markets, only a very limited number of studies have explored the
topic in countries where the private equity industry remains small, i.e.,
where the private equity market does not yet represent a visible alternative
source for ﬁnancing companies. The only study on this topic that has gone
beyond merely identifying the criteria used by VCs in such type of market
was carried out by Bliss (1999) and aimed at assessing the impact of
economic context (a transition economy), rather than the inﬂuence of the
dimension and maturity of the private equity market on VCs’ decisionmaking process. While the results of Bliss’s study clearly reveal processual
differences between the decision-making process of VCs in Poland as
compared to that described in previous processual studies (Wells 1974,
Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, Hall 1989, Fried and Hisrich 1994, Boocock and
Woods 1997), given the implicit assumption of his study, Bliss concludes
that all these differences result from the particular economic context of a
transition economy.
In order to understand the importance of the industry context it,
therefore, appears to be necessary to proceed with an exploratory research
on the VCs’ decision-making process in the context of small equity
markets. Given that most European countries have small private equity
markets, the analysis of the inﬂuence of industry context on VCs’ decisionmaking process could contribute importantly to generating more comprehensive knowledge to the research ﬁeld. This study represents an attempt
to address this issue.

Methodology
Adopting the deﬁnition of process proposed by Pettigrew (1997: 338), this
study aimed at capturing the ‘sequence of individual and collective events,
actions, and activities unfolding over time in context’. The goal of this
exploratory study, thus, was to capture the VCs’ decision-making process
in the context of small equity market from a processual perspective.
Given that the characteristics of a venture vary by stage of development
(Ruhnka and Young 1987, Fried and Hisrich 1994), the attention of this
study was concentrated on early-stage proposals.1 Moreover, interested in
generating knowledge to assist entrepreneurs in obtaining funds, this study
focuses on the ﬁrst phase in the VCs’ decision-making cycle, namely, the
investment process.
An instrumental case study (see Stake 1995) was used to develop
understanding of whether or not the maturity of the equity market exerts
an inﬂuence on the VCs’ decision-making process. The case study
methodology was chosen to capture rich informational content regarding
the decision-making process, overcoming the limitations of other methodological approaches, namely, questionnaires, interviews and experiments
used in the previous studies.
The main technique used for gathering empirical evidence in this
exploratory case study was participant observation, a qualitative method that
requires the researcher to become a participant in the culture and the
context that he/she observes. The method consists in gathering ‘data by
participating in the daily life of the group or organization’ studied and, as
well as watching the people in the ‘situations they ordinarily meet’, entering
into ‘conversations with some or all of the participants in these situations’
and discovering ‘their interpretations of the events’ observed (Becker 1958:
652). The purpose of the participant-observer, living for an extended
period of time in a certain context (in order to become accepted as a part of
the community), is to ensure that the observations register the phenomenon
in its natural occurrence. In this particular ﬁeld study, the focus was on
capturing the events, activities and outputs associated with the decisionmaking process of venture capitalists as well as the criteria used along the
process to assess the proposals (see Jorgensen 1989).
The main difference between participant observation and the methods
applied in previous studies is that the data gathered with this method
combines a real-time, holistic and dynamic view on the decision-making
process of VCs in its natural occurrence. It provides a real-time view in the
sense that the information is gathered in the moment it happens. It is
holistic because this method enables gathering information from the
various players—VCs, entrepreneurs, experts, support staff—involved in
the decision-making process. It is dynamic because it generates information
on the interactions between the various players as well as provides insights
on the sequence of activities and events along the process itself. Therefore,
this method has the advantage of minimizing the problems associated with
the majority of past research, namely the retrospective and self-reporting
biases associated with ex-post interviews and questionnaires and the
reductionism associated with experiments. Participant observation has also

<-----Page 8----->VC DECISIONS IN SMALL EQUITY MARKETS

133

the advantage when compared to verbal protocol technique, because it
permits gathering the information in its natural occurrence rather than in a
controlled environment.
As referred by Jorgensen (1993: 45) there are two basic strategies to
gaining access to phenomena of interest when using participant observation
technique. When the researcher openly requests permission to observe, the
strategy is called overt. When that is not the case, the strategy is then named
covert. The strategy chosen in this study was overt. In this research, the
application to participate and observe was made directly to the CEO of the
company with a short description of the research project and a proposal to
do participant observation research. After a preliminary approval I was
invited to present the research project to the board of directors. At the end
of this meeting, after guaranteeing the conﬁdentiality of the players and
proposals involved, the access was granted. It was agreed that I would
conduct the participant observation research over a 4 month period, acting
as assistant to an investment analyst, with authorization to assist in
meetings and interview the personnel with the aim of collecting
information concerning the VCs’ decision-making process when selecting
early-stage projects.
During this period of time, I observed the daily routines and carried
informal discussions with the personnel, in particular, with investment
analysts and executives. I also analysed the information provided by the
entrepreneurs, the internal reports, contractual agreements, press releases
and personal notes of the investment analysts, as well as the ofﬁcial
company reports. Complementarily, I was granted the opportunity to
observe the meetings between representatives of the VCF and entrepreneurs, the weekly company meetings and the executive meetings in which
the early-stage projects were analysed. To ﬁnalize the evidence collection
process, I conducted a standardized open-end interview with each senior

executive and investment analyst of the VCF. Appendix 1 compiles the
sources of evidence used in this case study.
During the ﬁeld study, I collected relevant data rather openly, taking
ﬁeld notes with a pen and notebook. When that was not possible, I waited
until I could return to my desk to write down the observations,
conversations and feelings experienced. In addition to this, I photocopied
or saved (in electronic format) various documents and audio recorded the
formal interviews conducted with the investment analysts and executives.
Case study
The ﬁrm chosen for this instrumental case study is one of the ﬁrst VCFs in
Portugal. Launched in the late 1980s, the company is responsible for
management of four funds, with a total of more than 100 million euros for
venture capital investment. Its major investor is a public institute, other
relevant investors being major Portuguese ﬁnancial groups.
Currently the VCF manages a portfolio of more than 50 companies in
several sectors and different regions of the country. It has invested an
average of 400 000 euros per portfolio company in exchange for a minority
position in their equity. From a team of more than 20 collaborators, three
senior executives, three senior investment analysts, and three junior
investment analysts are directly involved in the decision-making process
of the VCF.
Results and discussion
The evidence presented here was gathered during the four months
(September to December 2002) of the ﬁeld study, and concerns the
decision-making process regarding 16 early-stage proposals. Table 3
provides a brief description of the proposals by sector, stage of ﬁnancing
and decision reached. At the time when the ﬁeld study was initiated, four of
the 16 early-stage proposals were already under analysis. At the end of the
observation period, six proposals where still undergoing analysis (one with
an internal decision to invest). The investments expected for the proposals
studied range in size from 50 000 euros to 2.5 million euros.
As the data was being gathered the information was classiﬁed by source
of evidence and compiled by proposal. The codes used to classify the
sources of evidence were O (observations), I (interviews) and D
(documents). After the ﬁeld study was completed and the interviews
transcribed, the data analysis was initiated with a content analysis of the
evidence gathered. During this analysis the activities, events and criteria
identiﬁed were also coded. The codes used for the classiﬁcation were A
(activity), E (event), CE (criteria regarding the entrepreneur), CB (criteria
regarding the business idea), CM (criteria regarding the market), CD
(criteria regarding the deal) and CO (other criteria).
The activities and events that became salient are listed in Appendix 2.

proposal that contributed to uncover these activities and events. The
decision-making criteria identiﬁed are compiled in Appendix 3. It speciﬁes
the proposals and phases in which each criterion was assessed.
As a result of the analysis of the evidence gathered concerning the
decision-making process of VCs with regard to the business proposals
analysed, a visual representation of the investment process of the VCF was
elaborated. Figure 1 represents the process from the entrepreneur’s
business idea until the VCF decision to invest or to reject the proposal.
It includes all the relevant activities carried out by the VCs, as well as the
six intermediary events identiﬁed and the two ﬁnal events possible (venture
capital investment or proposal rejection). In this ﬁgure, a square depicts an
activity performed in order to achieve a particular aim, while an ellipse
represents an event, i.e. a rather momentary occurrence, an outcome of one
or more activities.
Compared to the models of VCs’ decision-making process encountered
in the previous literature, signiﬁcant differences where found with regard
to both, the process and the criteria applied. These differences are
highlighted with a special emphasis on those that may be explained as
resulting from the dimension and maturity of equity market. Some of the
differences further discussed refer to the structure and dynamics of the
decision-making process, while the others are associated with a speciﬁc
stage. In order to facilitate the comparison of this model with those
developed in the past, ﬁgure 2 presents how the various activities and
events identiﬁed here could be converted into phases. The observations
during the ﬁeld study suggest that the decision-making process is more

<-----Page 12----->VC DECISIONS IN SMALL EQUITY MARKETS

137

interactive than the existing models generally depict. Moreover, some of
the activities in the various phases of decision-making process may occur
simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
In the previous literature, interaction between the VCF and the
entrepreneur(s) is portrayed as taking place only after the proposals have
successfully gone through the (formal) screening phase. However, in the
ﬁeld study the ﬁrst interaction often took place in the very beginning of the
process. For instance, VCF’s representatives were approached by the
entrepreneurs in a public presentation or were contacted by mail or by
phone for a meeting. During the ﬁeld study, eight out of 12 new proposals
were initiated by entrepreneurs’ informal contact with the VCF. These early
interactions are used by both the entrepreneur(s) and the VCs as a form of
rapidly clarifying whether or not the business idea is eligible for even
preliminary evaluation without considerable investment of time and
resources. In the process presented in ﬁgure 1, this activity is denominated
informal screening. During the ﬁeld study, ﬁve of the 12 new proposals
presented were rejected as a result of informal screening.
This difference with regard to the interactive aspect of the decisionmaking process might be explained by the maturity and dimension of the
private equity market. Contrarily to the situation in developed market
contexts, in a market where a lack of knowledge about venture capital still
exists, these early interactions are used by the VCF to inform the
entrepreneurs about the functions and implications of venture capital
ﬁnancing, while at the same time eliminating the unsuitable proposals.
These interactions are also used for gathering the basic information about
the business idea, in particular, as an alternative to reading a formal
business plan, which in the case of early-stage proposals in this market
context often do not exist at the beginning of the investment process.
In the ﬁeld study, it became evident that in the different phases of the
decision-making process several activities were taking place simultaneously, rather than sequentially as it is represented in some of the
previous models (e.g. Hall 1989). For instance, after the VCs’ decision to
proceed with the further investigation of the proposal (event 4), three
activities were usually initiated simultaneously (see ﬁgure 1): the validation
of information (due diligence), the collection of (further) information and
the negotiations of the basic aspects of the deal terms with the
entrepreneurs.
Concerning the differences associated with speciﬁc stage of decisionmaking process, the most relevant ones were found in the phases, stages
or steps of the process generally regarded to as deal origination, deal
evaluation and deal structuring phase (see, for example, Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984). As to the deal origination phase, the evidence gathered in
the ﬁeld study points towards the existence of a signalling activity.
Signalling was carried out by the VCF and consisted in pro-actively
informing the potential entrepreneurs (in conferences or other public
occasions/presentations) about venture capital and the type of business
the VCF is looking for, in order to capture new valuable proposals.
Aiming at capturing good business opportunities, the VCF under
investigation also participated as a jury in business competitions and

<-----Page 13----->138

invested in business incubators. The observations clearly point to a rather
signiﬁcant active approach in the deal origination phase, instead of
passively waiting for unsolicited or referred proposals. Such an active
approach seems to result from a lack of a strong referral network (during
the ﬁeld study none of the 12 new proposals came from referred deals)
that could present selected proposals to the VCF, as it usually happens in
developed equity markets. The signiﬁcant active approach (pro-active
solicitations) in deal origination phase was also noted by Bliss (1999) in
VCs’ decision-making process of a transition economy, which also have a
small equity market. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that rather
than being a characteristic of ‘the unique economic conditions and
operating environment in Poland’ (Bliss 1999: 248), the difference can
instead be due to the maturity of the equity market.
In the deal evaluation phase (located between the events 4 and 6 in ﬁgure
1), the observations and archival review carried out during the ﬁeld study
reveal that a proposal may go through several evaluation cycles. This
happened in the situations when further validation or collection of
information was needed before reaching an internal decision to invest
(event 6), as well as in those situations when a syndication of equity
ﬁnanciers was required. Two promising but yet immature proposals under
analysis had gone through several evaluation cycles and were reassessed in
the light of modiﬁcations or development of the business idea. On the basis
of observations and information obtained in informal conversations with
VCs, an explanation for the willingness of the VCF both, to wait for
modiﬁcations or development of the business idea and to re-evaluate the
proposal instead of simply rejecting the proposal, may once again be found
in the maturity and dimension of the private equity market and, in
particular, in the fact that in small markets interesting proposals do not
abound.
The activities carried out by VCs in the last phase do not entirely
correspond to those described in the models by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984),
Hall (1989), and Boocock and Woods (1997). In the ﬁeld study, an
important activity, namely the negotiation of the deal terms, was normally
initiated already during the evaluation phase. After the VCF internal
decision to invest in the proposal (event 6 in ﬁgure 1), the main activity
pursued is the negotiation of the contract terms, since at this stage the deal
terms are nearly totally deﬁned. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
closing phase proposed by Fried and Hisrich (1994).
Regarding the decision-making criteria applied by the VCF, most of the
observations during the study are in accordance with ﬁndings of the
previous literature. The evidence collected indicates that VCs pay
signiﬁcant attention to the entrepreneur(s), placing a special focus on the
knowledge or contacts (that add value for the business project) developed
by the entrepreneurs in their previous jobs or in their research activity. In
the screening stage, the curriculum vitae was an important source of
information used by VCs to infer the value of entrepreneurs. During a
formal screening meeting, one proposal was quickly rejected, since the
credibility of the whole proposal was heavily affected by the fact that the
information about the entrepreneurs was lacking.

<-----Page 14----->VC DECISIONS IN SMALL EQUITY MARKETS

139

VCs also attempted to verify the degree of commitment of the
entrepreneur(s). In the screening phase, the VCs tried to assess if the
entrepreneurs were indeed presenting a great business idea and, hence,
were willing to risk a currently stable or well-remunerated job or if they,
instead, viewed the business proposed for ﬁnancing merely as means of
creating their own jobs.
Finally, during the interactions with entrepreneurs, VCs tried to
understand whether or not the entrepreneurs had a thorough understanding of the business. For instance, have they conducted a basic
preliminary market research? Have they considered the various risks and
costs involved, and thought of the possible alternatives in case the original
strategy fails?
With regard to the business idea, VCs seem to give preference to
proposals in growing industries, rather than industries currently facing
difﬁculties (e.g. e-businesses). Another interesting aspect veriﬁed in
observation was that in the case of proposals concerning a consumer
product, VCs role-played, using themselves or the people within the circles
of their personal relations as potential customers, in order to evaluate the
relevance of the new product. Furthermore, VCs seem to look for
businesses with a reasonable growing potential. Although they did not
exclude very small proposals from the analysis, VCs expressed serious
concerns about investing in small businesses, as the resources required for
monitoring and value adding the investment would be equal or superior to
those involved in larger proposals. The sustainability of the competitive
advantage of the business was also carefully examined, considering such
aspects as the threat of new entrance, development of substitute products
and the ability of the new ﬁrm to secure their value-added by protecting
their innovations.
Contrary to the ﬁndings in the previous literature, ﬁnancial projections
were not considered essential in early-stage proposals. Being considered
unreliable, ﬁnancial projections were often used by VCs merely to
estimate the break-even point of the company under analysis. As referred
by Royer (2003: 56), ‘clearly, any project has to start with faith because
there typically isn’t much objective evidence, if any, at the beginning to
justify it. But, as a project unfolds and investment increase, this faith has
to be increasingly tested against data’. The decision based on the ‘faith’
about the ﬁnancial potential of the business idea held true for the only
proposal over which the decision to invest was internally reached by the
VCF during period of the ﬁeld study. Since the investment required was
not large, it was decided to invest in order to see the potential of the
business and to eventually secure VCF’s position in future rounds of
ﬁnancing.
Conclusion
Despite signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture
capital decision-making process, the importance of such contextual factors
as dimension and maturity of private equity market have not yet been

<-----Page 15----->140

JORGE SILVA

considered. The instrumental case study of a Portuguese VCF presented in
this article was an attempt to investigate this research gap. Adopting a
processual perspective, the case study was focused on the ﬁrst phase in the
VC’s decision-making cycle, namely, the investment process.
The discrepancies revealed in the case study concern the structure and
the dynamics of decision-making process. First, the overall process was
found to be more interactive than it is portrayed in the preceding VC’s
decision-making models. This difference may be explained by the maturity
and dimension of the private equity market. Furthermore, some of the
activities traditionally thought of as occurring sequentially, may actually be
carried out simultaneously.
The discrepancies in particular stages of the process concern in particular
the deal origination phase, where a signiﬁcant pro-active behaviour of the
VCF was observed; and the deal evaluation phase, in which an important
difference found was willingness of the VCF to re-evaluate promising yet
immature proposals. These phase-speciﬁc discrepancies may also be
explained by the maturity of the private equity market. However, the
dynamic observed in the deal evaluation phase may be due to the
methodology applied in the previous studies. The most signiﬁcant ﬁnding
in the closing phase was that, contrarily to what is described in the majority
of existing models, the negotiations of the deal terms are completed but not
initiated in this phase. Instead, this activity was already initiated in the
evaluation phase.
Finally, regarding the decision-making criteria applied by the VCF, most
of the observations during the study are in accordance with ﬁndings of the
previous literature. VCs’ attention is indeed very much focused on
entrepreneur(s), their personal and professional characteristics and their
commitment to the business idea. Additionally, VCs tend to assess carefully
the business idea, its growing potential as well as the sustainability of its
competitive advantages. However, contrarily to ﬁndings in the previous
literature, the observations in the ﬁeld study suggest that the ﬁnancial
projections do not play such an important decision factor for early-stage
proposals.
