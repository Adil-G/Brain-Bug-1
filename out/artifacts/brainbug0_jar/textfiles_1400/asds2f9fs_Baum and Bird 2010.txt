e develop a model of successful intelligence in entrepreneurship. The model was tested through interviews with
22 printing industry CEOs and responses from 143 founders of early-stage, high-growth printing and graphics businesses. Successful intelligence combined with entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy to predict swift action and multiple improvement
actions (repeated goal-driven changes). Swift action and multiple improvement actions predicted higher subsequent venture
growth across four years. This ﬁeld study conﬁrmed that successful intelligence consists of practical, analytical, and creative intelligence and that, together with entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy, it enables and motivates successful entrepreneurial
behavior. Intelligence has received little entrepreneurship research attention; however, this empirical study suggests that
speciﬁc intelligences should be included as predictors in studies of venture outcomes. The two entrepreneurial behaviors
developed here are useful concepts beyond the entrepreneurship domain.
Key words: entrepreneurship; successful intelligence; venture growth; cognition; entrepreneurial behavior

Introduction

Entrepreneurship researchers have increased empirical attention to cognitions (Baron 2004, Corbett 2007,
Krueger et al. 2000, Mitchell et al. 2000, Simon et al.
2000), but few studies address general or speciﬁc intelligence directly. Among the few, Baron and Markman
(2003) studied social competence, which is related to
social intelligence. They found a relation to ﬁnancial
success. Mitchell et al. (2000) drew on social cognition and information-processing theory (Fiske and Taylor
1991) to explain and show signiﬁcant relationships
between expert ability scripts (related to practical intelligence) and the venture creation decision. Also, few studies of entrepreneurial behavior exist; thus, there is an
opportunity to build understanding about the impact of
entrepreneurs’ intelligence and action on venture success.
Sternberg’s (2007) conception of SI is appealing for
practitioners as well as academics because SI is task oriented, and SI can be improved. People can develop their
successful intelligence by capitalizing on their strengths,
compensating for their weaknesses, and adapting to, or
shaping, their environments. SI is situational. Sternberg
described the usefulness of successful intelligence for
understanding entrepreneurship, leadership, and strategic
and operational management.
Sternberg (1997, 2004) explains that SI consists of
practical intelligence (PI), analytical intelligence (AI),
and creative intelligence (CI), and he emphasizes that
all three components of SI (PI, AI, and CI) are needed

Successful intelligence in the entrepreneurship context is
the ability to succeed in new venture creation and growth.
Successful creation and development of high-growth
opportunities is critical for economic well-being (Bhide
2000, Shane and Venkataraman 2000). Indeed, growing
ventures are the dominant source of job creation, market
innovation, and economic growth (Hisrich et al. 2007).
Unfortunately, over 50% of new ventures fail within
ﬁve years (Aldrich 1999).
Personal characteristics of entrepreneurs, together with
features of the venture opportunity itself, are among the
strongest predictors of new venture failure and success
(Baum et al. 2006). According to venture ﬁnanciers,
early venture growth depends largely on characteristics
of the entrepreneur (Shepherd 1999, Zopounidis 1994).
Thus, understanding entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics that drive successful new venturing can yield important social and economic gains.
Recently, Sternberg (2004) argued that his (1997) theory of successful intelligence (SI) contributes to the
explanation of successful entrepreneurship. We took this
as a challenge to better understand SI in the entrepreneurship domain by conducting an empirical test of
Sternberg’s theory of SI in terms of (1) its composition and (2) how it relates with entrepreneurship growth.
Our study ﬁts the cognitive and behavioral streams of
research about entrepreneurs.

for success. Thus, we study the components individually
and their amalgamation as a predictor of behaviors that
improve new venture growth. Social intelligence (SOC)
and emotional intelligence (EMO) are additional types
of speciﬁc intelligence, and each has received attention
from organizational and leadership psychologists (Caruso
et al. 2002), and entrepreneurship scholars (Baron and
Markman 2003). We agree with Baron and Markman
that competencies based on SOC and EMO, such as
network building and self-management, may contribute
to successful new venture creation and growth. Thus,
we focus on SI, but we also measure and analyze SOC
and EMO.
Our overarching purpose is to contribute to knowledge about the effects of speciﬁc intelligence through
understanding the links between SI and new venture
growth. We also want to contribute to growing interest about the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs.
Our speciﬁc purpose is to ﬁnd answers to the following research questions: (1) Does SI contribute to new
venture growth (NVG)? (2) What factors intervene in
the relation of SI and NVG, and how are the factors
conﬁgured? (3) Does SI consist of PI, AI, and CI as proposed by Sternberg (1997)? As shown in Figure 1, we
model links between SI and its components and between
SI and NVG (H1 to H4). Our exploration of SI will
include (1) analysis of the importance of each component of SI for NVG (PI, AI, and CI); (2) understanding the role of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy (ESE) in the
relation between SI and NVG (ESE is a speciﬁc form
Figure 1

of conﬁdence); and (3) evaluation of the mediation of
SI and NVG by two entrepreneurial behaviors that are
developed in this study, “swift action” (SA) and “multiple improvement actions” (MIA).
We study NVG because early-stage growth is an
indicator of venture success (Covin and Slevin 1997,
Shane and Venkataraman 2000). We chose to study
high-growth entrepreneurs (HGEs) who operate in a single industry to control the context as much as possible. In contrast with “mom and pop” or “lifestyle”
entrepreneurs, HGEs are founders who own and manage
their young promising ventures with a vision of signiﬁcant employment and wealth creation. PI, AI, SA, MIA,
and ﬁve control variables were measured across a threeyear period to assess their stability, and subsequent NVG
was measured across a four-year period.
At a high level, this study contributes to understanding
the personal characteristics of successful entrepreneurs,
a group that makes major contributions to world
prosperity. Our direct research contributions are as follows: (1) We offer one of the ﬁrst studies of the effects
of entrepreneurs’ intelligence with empirical evidence
that SI impacts new venture growth through moderation by ESE and mediation by SA and MIA. (2) We
develop and explore two entrepreneurial behaviors, SA
and MIA, which mediate the effects of SI on subsequent NVG. These two factors should be useful in
future entrepreneurship research. (3) Also, the study

contributes empirical support for the multiple component conception of SI, and it introduces a ﬁeld study
form of Sternberg’s measurement of practical intelligence (Sternberg et al. 1995b).
The theory section is developed in two parts. First, we
review knowledge about the three components of successful intelligence (SI) and argue that SI and its components are particularly relevant for study of high-growth
entrepreneurship. Then, we propose and explain a conﬁguration of SI, ESE, SA, and MIA for prediction of
subsequent NVG.

Theoretical Background
Intelligence and Successful Entrepreneurship
Sternberg’s (2004) proposal that SI explains successful
entrepreneurship appeared after 40 years of entrepreneurship research that gave little attention to entrepreneurs’
intelligence. To be fair, few organization researchers from
any research domain gave attention to the predictive ability of intelligence (Nyburg 2003). Perhaps attention was
scant because adult intelligence is commonly conceived
in general terms (“g”) that are stable and not subject
to improvement (Cici 1996). In contrast, speciﬁc intelligence (social, emotional, successful, etc.) is receiving increasing attention from organization researchers
and psychologists (Sternberg 1997) because it can be
developed.
Practical Intelligence. Among the three components
of SI, PI is an experience-based accumulation of skills,
dispositions, tacit knowledge, and the ability to apply
same to solve everyday problems (Sternberg et al.
1995a). Some refer to PI as “street smarts.” Experienceand domain-based PI is the most malleable of the three
components of SI. It can be improved with additional
relevant experience (Sternberg 2007), and it provides the
“know how” for idea generation and development of new
business ideas. PI has an implicit, unarticulated quality,
and within speciﬁc domains, practical intelligence is the
basis for expertise (Sonnentag 1998). Because practical
intelligence is largely tacit, it cannot, by deﬁnition, be
completely explicated or formalized in text or shared easily with others; so, it is not easily imitated. Because it is
held privately, it is not available for competitors. Thus, it
is a more valuable and persistent source of entrepreneurs’
competitive advantage than explicit knowledge.
Practical Intelligence and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. PI is available for immediate, solitary—
almost automatic—use. PI’s ready solutions are generally useful, but particularly for HGEs who face challenging self-set goals and the demands of growing ventures.
For example, HGEs own, and perhaps manage, companies that suffer resource shortages and face disturbed
markets. If they are to realize their goals and produce a

399

proﬁt, HGEs must cope with needs for additional ﬁnancing to support additional infrastructure, ﬁnd employees
who ﬁt, and integrate new management and marketing
systems. These problems are ampliﬁed by rapid growth,
and they typically emerge in the midst of a storm of
problems and opportunities.
Thus, relevant PI enables decisions when there is
not time for thorough research and analysis. Even if
there were sufﬁcient time, there are cases where there
is no point in searching for information. It may not
exist because of the newness of the products or markets, or it may have become useless as dynamic markets shift and technology becomes obsolete (Baum and
Wally 2003). Finally, if competitors or substitutes exist,
the need to move quickly may be motivated by those
who take advantage of any opening (Ferrier et al. 1999).
However, even high-growth entrepreneurs have periods when urgency is not great—when sufﬁcient time
and resources are available for a thorough and comprehensive information search and analysis. Even then, a
well-stocked store of PI will (1) enable the search for
explicit information through tacit knowledge about how
to ﬁnd explicit information, and (2) enrich the analysis
through relevant tacit knowledge about the best process
for evaluation of options.
Entrepreneurship Research Related to Practical Intelligence. Sternberg (2004) indicated that there was no
empirical research about entrepreneurs’ practical intelligence, and we could ﬁnd none in recent entrepreneurship
publications. However, tacit knowledge is a fundamental
component of PI, and there have been four empirical
studies of entrepreneurs’ tacit knowledge that appeared
over 12 years in Marchisio and Ravasi (2001) Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research. Two of these studies are (1) Dyke et al. (1989) and (2) Marchisio and
Ravasi (2001). None of the studies included a focus on
the application of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge was
not measured in an entrepreneurship setting, nor was it
measured consistent with the Sternberg et al. (1995b)
suggested methodology for measuring PI, as we have.
Despite the absence of empirical studies about
entrepreneurs and PI, the Sternberg et al. (1995b) ﬁnding of a relationship between PI and personal success
should apply in the entrepreneurship domain because PI
contributes to entrepreneurs’ ability to navigate in the
midst of uncertainty, poor information, and tight time
constraints; thus, we expect that PI has a signiﬁcant link
with NVG as a component of SI.
Analytical Intelligence. Sternberg (1997) referred to
AI as the ability to learn, remember, and retrieve information quickly. AI underpins most measures of academic achievement and readiness, such as the SAT,
GMAT, and GRE tests. It helps us to analyze and evaluate multiple and complex courses of action. Most people
think of AI as conventional intelligence. AI is a business

<-----Page 3----->400

asset because it enables collection, integration, and interpretation of large amounts of complex information. Even
the brightest managers are challenged by the increasing complexity, interdependence of business factors, and
speed of change, but those with the highest AI have a
competitive advantage; they can better differentiate a situation into elements and draw on their multidimensional
thinking. Because AI is held privately, it may be a capability that is not visible to competitors. It may be a ﬁxed
human characteristic; however, some experts argue that
all cognitive abilities are domain speciﬁc and improvable
(Cici 1996).
Analytic Intelligence and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. We study high-growth “new” ventures
that may appear as (1) new competitors in new markets of established industries or (2) new competitors in
totally new industries. Those entrepreneurs who compete
in established industries need information about established competitors’ ability to also enter their new target
niche; however, most new ventures do not have relevant accumulated data or experienced analysis resources,
such as those that appear within established companies. In contrast, entrepreneurs in this situation need
high AI to enable rapid acquisition and quick analysis
of scarce and complex information. Entrepreneurs who
operate in totally new industries face even greater information scarcity than those who operate in established
markets. Product and market assessments may be based
on experience-based PI; however, directly relevant information must be generated by experimental market entry.
Entrepreneurship Research Related to Analytical Intelligence. As noted earlier, there is little entrepreneurship (or organizational) research that relates to
general or speciﬁc intelligence. There is no empirical
research about entrepreneurs and analytic ability. However, AI is a cognitive ability, and there is much empirical research that indicates positive relationships between
cognitive ability and personal performance (Cici 1996)
and entrepreneurship performance (Gimeno et al. 1997).
Thus, we expect that AI has a signiﬁcant link with NVG
as a component of SI.
Creative Intelligence. CI is the ability to generate
high-quality novel ideas that meet the needs of a task or
context (Sternberg 2004). Those who have high CI challenge the status quo and seek alternative ways to solve
problems and gain advantage from opportunities. There
are many ways to study creativity (e.g., personal characteristics, outcomes, environments). We follow Sternberg
and other psychologists who focus on creative processes
such as divergent thinking for problem solving to underpin their conception of CI (Mednick 1968, Mumford
et al. 1997, Torrance 1972). As such, CI is subject to
domain-speciﬁc experience and training (Runco et al.
2001). CI is held privately, so it can afford a persistent
competitive advantage.

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

Creative Intelligence and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. CI is a stereotypical trait of entrepreneurs, the movers and shakers behind creative destruction (Schumpeter 1934). Entrepreneurs need CI during
all phases of entrepreneurship—idea getting, opportunity
recognition, startup, and growth. During the idea getting
phase, CI is essential for conception and elaboration of
new product and process designs and new business models (Shane 2000). Those entrepreneurs who do not have
CI must look elsewhere for innovations by partnering
with an inventor or developer through licensing or joint
venturing. Of course, some exploiters simply copy the
ideas of others.
Baron (2004) and Baron and Markman (2003)
pointed to the importance of creativity for recognizing which new product, process, and business model
ideas have commercial value (“opportunity recognition”). Entrepreneurs must envision new product ideas
applied in multiple possible commercial settings and
conceive a variety of well-articulated commercial paths
and outcomes. Of course, successful opportunity recognition also draws on PI and AI for generation and evaluation of the array of commercial paths. CI is also valuable during start up and growth phases as barriers to
successful production, servicing, or marketing emerge.
Entrepreneurs who hit barriers must be ﬂexible and
experimental; they must be able to think of novel alternative solutions—quickly.
Creativity Related to Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Creativity researchers have produced many popular schemes for measurement of creativity (Kirton 1976,
Mumford et al. 1997). Studies indicate positive relationships between creativeness/creative ability/divergent
thinking and personal/business success (Czikszentmihalyi
1996, LePine et al. 2000) and entrepreneurship success
(Ames and Runco 2005, DeTienne and Chandler 2004).
Overall, we expect that CI will be important for HGEs’
success because it contributes to new venture processes
through (1) generation of novel initial ideas, (2) conception of novel commercial paths during opportunity
recognition, and (3) conception of novel operating solutions during startup and early growth. Thus, we expect
that CI has a signiﬁcant link with NVG as a component
of SI.
Practical, Analytical, and Creative Intelligence
Combine as Successful Intelligence
Sternberg emphasized that “Successful entrepreneurship
requires a blend of analytical, creative, and practical aspects of intelligence   ” (1997, 2004, p. 189).
In support of the “blend” of speciﬁc intelligence
within Sternberg’s SI theory, we explained that multiple
components of SI have roles across the stages of
entrepreneurship. In summary, PI (know how) provides ready knowledge about past ideas, processes, and

<-----Page 4----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

optional paths to success (business models). During the
idea getting phase, PI provides a starting point for invention and problem solution. Through divergent thinking,
CI is a source of novel ideas and options, and AI is important for ﬁnding information and evaluating complex
arrays of options. Thus, we expect that the blend of PI,
AI, and CI, identiﬁed as SI, contributes to entrepreneurship success. However, we propose that the relation with
NVG involves additional factors that operate as moderators and mediators of the SI and NVG relationship.
Moderators and Mediators of Successful
Intelligence and New Venture Growth
Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy. It is not enough to have
high practical, analytical, and creative intelligence to
achieve high new venture growth. HGEs must also be
conﬁdent about their ability to apply their intelligence.
Self-efﬁcacy is a concept that describes the belief or
degree of conﬁdence that someone has in their ability
to successfully perform a task. Bandura (1997) and subsequent meta-analyses by Judge and Bono (2001) point
to the central role of self-efﬁcacy in causing high performance through its impact on motivation; Stajkovic
and Luthans (1998) explained that self-efﬁcacy enhances
focus, direction, persistence, and intensity of action.
Without self-efﬁcacy, little will happen; HGEs with high
self-efﬁcacy believe that they have all of the resources
within themselves, and at hand, to accomplish their task
goals (Chen et al. 1998).
Several conceptions of individual differences, other
than self-efﬁcacy, also reﬂect conﬁdence (e.g., locus
of control, self-esteem); however, all are more general (Bandura 1997). To concentrate on high-growth
entrepreneurs, we apply (ESE), as developed by Chen
et al. (1998), in our model. ESE is the extent to which
individuals are conﬁdent in their ability to produce consistently high levels of performance in entrepreneurspeciﬁc tasks (Chen et al. 1998). High ESE reﬂects
entrepreneurs’ belief that they have the innovation, marketing, management, risk taking, and ﬁnancial resources
to succeed with new venture exploration, startup, and
early growth. Empirical studies offer evidence that ESE
predicts entrepreneurial behavior (Chen et al. 1998) and
venture growth (Baum and Locke 2004).
We propose that HGEs’ entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
(ESE) enhances SI to create a force, SI × ESE, that
reﬂects ability (SI) and beliefs (ESE). SI × ESE is
an interaction wherein SI is the focal concept that is
moderated in a positive direction by ESE. As a situationally speciﬁc force like SI, ESE impacts decision
choices, so beliefs about resources may vary across decision options. Because decision makers choose options
that are linked with high self-efﬁcacy over options that
are attached to low self-efﬁcacy, the importance of the
level and domain of resources such as SI is multiplied.

401

Those with high SI × ESE marry their intelligence with
conﬁdence and apply focus, direction, persistence, and
intensity to their entrepreneurial actions. In the case of
successful HGEs, the behaviors used improve subsequent NVG. We chose an interaction hypothesis (versus a mediation hypothesis) because at extreme levels of
SI and ESE, the combined effects on behavior are probably greater than isolated effects of SI or ESE alone.
Furthermore, SI probably has signiﬁcant direct effects
on NVG (Sternberg 2004) that are not totally contained
in the direct relation with ESE.
Behavior Mediators of SI × ESE and NVG
In a classic entrepreneurship article, Stevenson (1985)
offered a framework for understanding entrepreneurial
behavior; he contrasted entrepreneurs’ and managers’
behavior in terms of opportunity recognition, commitment of resources, and management style. Stevenson
pointed to the importance of rapid responses to market demands through multistaged actions for venture
success. Bhide (2000) built on Stevenson’s focus on
speed and ﬂexibility and conducted a case study of 100
new ventures in a rare empirical study of entrepreneurs’
behavior; he conﬁrmed that successful entrepreneurs
(1) make quick incremental decisions because they
face uncertainty and market pressure, (2) take fast
action that involves minimal investment in temporary
assets, (3) gain from trial and error, and (4) adapt to
opportunities.
Recent empirical research about entrepreneurs’
“change behaviors” adds to the Stevenson (1985)–Bhide
(2000) “fast ﬂexibility” theme. For example, Baker et al.
(2003) and Hmieleski and Corbett (2006) link improvisation and bricolage with venture success. Thus, we
draw on Stevenson (1985), Bhide (2000), and those who
focus on improvisation/bricolage to guide our identiﬁcation of two HGE behaviors that enable new venture
growth: (1) swift action and (2) multiple improvement
actions (repeated goal-driven revision behavior).
Swift Action SA. Swift action and fast action have
appeared as prescriptions and organizational competencies in studies of product development projects
(Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995), global competition (Stalk
and Hout 1990), and successful competitive actions
(Ferrier et al. 1999). Fast decisions, which lead to swift
action, have related positively with ﬁrm performance in
new industries (Eisenhardt 1989) and in new ventures in
mature industries (Baum and Wally 2003). Some have
suggested that swift is not better, and this may be true in
some cases; however, in dynamic situations, Eisenhardt
(1989) found that fast decision makers were also more
comprehensive and more successful.
SA is beneﬁcial for high-growth entrepreneurs
because they operate in high uncertainty situations
wherein information is scarce. Early action can generate information and dynamic learning ahead of rivals.

<-----Page 5----->402

Unexpected opportunities sometimes emerge, but only
if action is started. SA may increase the number of trials that can be attempted within time and resource constraints, thereby providing more information and narrowed conﬁdence intervals.
Furthermore, high-growth entrepreneurs face new or
immature markets with scant information, so there may
be little reason to delay. SA may enable early adoption
(ﬁnding the right products, services, markets, and organization forms ahead of competitors), which may be a competitive advantage (Ferrier et al. 1999). Taken together,
it is not surprising that experienced entrepreneurs advise,
“just start, move quickly, and watch the unfolding action
for answers and opportunities” (Jones 1993, p. 110). We
capture the sentiment that fast action contributes signiﬁcantly to high new venture growth in H3 below.
Multiple Improvement Actions MIA. Scott (1987)
noted that when uncertainty dominates product, service,
and market issues, management should adjust by being
more experimental, ﬂexible, and improvisational. Experimentation, trial and error, improvisation, bricolage, ﬂexibility, and adaptation are behavioral descriptions of an
array of actions used to ﬁnd solutions, whether the
“problem” is a changed external situation or a new
challenging internal goal. The concepts describe change
behaviors but with slight variations. Search for improvement is an implicit goal in all, and repeated searches
are implicit in experimentation, trial and error, and adaptation; thus, we label the core features of the set of
change behaviors MIA to reﬂect a common concept for
our study. First, we describe each member of the set of
change behaviors.
“Experimentation” involves repeatedly conducting trials or tests to discover something that is not known
(Thomke 2003). Experimentation connotes use of a conceptual model and controls across the trials, in contrast
with “trial and error,” which reﬂects a more random
set of variables for each trial. Both experimentation
and trial and error suggest repeated cycles of action
with monitoring and revision or reformulation. “Improvisation” is extemporaneous composition and execution
of novel actions (Hmieleski and Corbett 2006, Miner
et al. 2001). Monitoring and revision are not included
in conceptions of improvisation; however, follow-up is
implicit because the literature explains improvisation
as short-term real-time learning. “Bricolage” is similar to improvisation, but with resources strictly limited
to those that are available (Baker et al. 2003). Some
studies of improvisation have focused on resource conditions, suggesting that improvisation occurs only with
resources in hand; however, most do not imply resource
constraints. Flexibility and adaptation are more general change behaviors that are triggered by changed
“situations.” Situational changes are not important in
conceptions of experimentation, trial and error, improvisation, or bricolage unless one considers recognition

Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

and acceptance of challenges, problems, or new goals as
changed situations. Follow-up, novelty, or resources are
not described as features of ﬂexibility or adaptation.
Taken together, we deﬁne MIA as change behaviors
that involve repeated goal-driven revision and continuous searches for betterment. In the new venture context,
MIA appears as actions toward goals that will involve
new (or better) products, services, processes, or organizations. MIA is most like experimentation, because it
does not involve production novelty or resource considerations. MIA implicitly involves monitoring and learning. The entire set of change behaviors is most useful for
information gathering, resource conservation, and opportunity taking when follow-up involves tight monitoring
of responses from markets, employees, and stakeholders
and when control of the unfolding action and reformulation or revision is tight (Levinthal and March 1993,
Thomke 2003).
MIAs are useful for high-growth entrepreneurs
because they reveal information about potential markets
where no markets exist. MIAs reveal customer reactions
to disruptive product, service, and business model introductions in existing markets (Bhide 2000, p. 60), and
they may enable recovery from poor past decisions or
missed opportunities. MIAs test and respond to rapid
changes in markets that often present surprise setbacks to
start-ups (Smith and Smith 2000) but also present opportunities to build better products/services. Thus, the fastmoving unresolved markets that entrepreneurs face and
their inability to get “hard” information to guide foresight
require change behaviors such as those labeled MIA.
Successful entrepreneurs tend to be comfortable enacting changes to cope with processes, products, or markets
that do not meet their goals (Baum et al. 2006). Miner
et al. (2001) and Hmieleski and Corbett (2006) found
that experimental, improvisational, and trial and error
behaviors are used by entrepreneurs to deal successfully
with their changing urgent situations, and Eisenhardt
(1989) observed “unintended trial actions” among the
successful entrepreneurs whom she studied. Thus, past
research ﬁndings and evaluation of the HGEs’ situation point to the value of MIA for new venture growth
(H4 below). Taken together, we propose that “SI × ESE”
reﬂects relevant intelligence and beliefs that drive behavior, and that SA and MIA are relevant behaviors that
improve NVG.
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Successful intelligence is enhanced by entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy in an interaction
(SI × ESE) that is positively related to swift action.
Hypothesis 2 (H2). Successful intelligence is enhanced by entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy in an interaction
(SI × ESE) that is positively related to multiple improvement actions.
Hypothesis 3 (H3). Swift action mediates the positive relation between SI × ESE and subsequent new venture growth (Implied: SA predicts subsequent NVG).

<-----Page 6----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs

Hypothesis 4 (H4). Multiple improvement actions
mediate the positive relation between SI × ESE and
subsequent new venture growth (Implied: MIA predicts
subsequent NVG).

Methodology

We chose to study members of the printing and graphics industry. Despite images of Ben Franklin at his
typesetter and aproned attendants in neighborhood fastprinting franchises, the printing and graphics industry
is competitive, growing, and changing rapidly. Some
members are high-growth companies that have attracted
private equity ﬁnancing. Improved production and management technologies have revolutionized the creation,
production, and distribution of products. Competition
from Internet-oriented operations and foreign companies
is threatening, and many product markets are in turmoil because of shifting customer “make versus buy”
preferences. Some customers have become competitors. Aggressive printers have taken advantage of this
dynamic situation by adding services such as processing customers’ direct mail and order fulﬁllment. Thus,
entrepreneurial behavior is important within large established printing companies and new printing ventures. We
focused our study on the hundreds of new businesses
that have been founded by printer-innovators who set
high-growth goals.
Requests to participate were mailed to 3,418 CEOs in
2001. The CEOs were members of the largest print and
graphics trade association. Incentives were offered, and
822 (24%) agreed to participate. We constructed an initial
survey from interviews with 22 founders and managers
of printing companies. The draft survey included scenarios to measure PI and SA. It was piloted and adapted
through interaction with 10 industry CEOs. The questionnaire collected personal and ﬁrm demographics, a
description of the company, and personal characteristics
including behaviors. In addition, ﬁnancial goals, ﬁnancial
performance since inception, and measures of regional
industry dynamism were collected.
Questionnaires were distributed online and in hard
copy to 822 in early 2002. We received 746 usable
responses. The representativeness of the 746 respondents, in terms of region of residency and ﬁrm size, was
veriﬁed with chi-squared similarity tests. Fifty cases of
self-reported ﬁnancial performance data were compared
with Dun and Bradstreet Inc. (2001–2006) data, and chisquared tests indicated similarity.
Additional incentives were offered to 472 CEOs who
had founded their companies since 1997, who had more
than 5 full-time employees, and who may have ﬁt
our standards for the “high-growth entrepreneur” classiﬁcation. Three hundred twelve of this target group
agreed to participate and supplied usable responses that
included tests of growth intentions and ability (three

403

hundred twelve is 66% of the target group or 9% of
the population). The 312 responses were screened so
that only owner-managers who had founded their ﬁrms
since 1998 and who intended to grow their businesses
to over 100 employees within 10 years were included.
The “100 employees in 10 years” growth goal standard
was selected on advice of 10 industry CEOs who agreed
that it was a fair “stretch goal” held by entrepreneurs
with high-growth potential. This process produced 146
candidate participants.
A follow-up survey was conducted in early 2005 to
enable evaluation of the stability of PI, AI, SA, MIA,
and control variables. The 2005 performance data (sales
and employment) were collected by phone in early 2006.
During 2006–2007, a follow-up survey was conducted
to measure CI, EMO, and SOC. This yielded a ﬁnal
sample of 143 HGEs. The sample is 55% of the HGEs
in the population, based on the proportion of HGEs
among the 312 respondents. Participants’ mean age was
33 years (SD = 522), mean business age was 3.3 years
(SD = 13), and mean employment was 11 (SD = 38)
in 2002.
Measurement Model, Measures, and Controls
The 14 measurement model latent concepts, number
of measurement items, collection format, LISREL 8.80
composite reliability (CR) (Joreskog and Sorbom 2006),
and research source for each concept are shown in
Table 1. CR is composite reliability, a structural equation-modeling statistic that is similar to ALPHA. A complete description of the measures is available from the
ﬁrst author.
(1) New Venture Growth NVG was measured with
two items (CR = 0.92): (1) the compound annual sales
growth rate from year-end 2001 to year-end 2005, and
(2) the compound annual employment growth rate from
year-end 2001 to year-end 2005. Nine cases of incomplete performance data were completed with data from
Dun and Bradstreet Inc. (2002–2006).
(2) Practical Intelligence PI was measured with
responses to three scenarios that followed design suggestions by Sternberg et al. (1995b). One scenario begins,
“Assume that it is your third year as founder/CEO
of Quality Printing and Graphics. Your business grew
according to your plan for the ﬁrst two years, but sales
have fallen. Unfortunately, you were counting on a 10%
volume increase to keep all of your presses busy    ”
The 150-word scenario continues to explain the cost of
a recently purchased machine in terms of “% of sales,”
cashﬂow challenges, break-even, and market conditions.
The respondents were presented with a list of 10 actions
and told to read the entire list of options and then rankorder the list according to their best sequential plan of
action. The actions include layoffs, cut compensation,
sales promotion, incentives, etc. Two other scenarios
were provided.

CR, composite reliability, is an indication of internal consistency such as ALPHA. CR is the sum of the square roots of the item squared
multiple correlations, squared, and divided by the same quantity plus the sum of the error variances (Werts et al. 1974).

A standard “best practice” ranking of the alternative
actions for each of the three scenarios was developed
using the average ranking used by respondents from the
top 50 companies in terms of their sales and employment
growth. The top 50 were selected from the 746 initial
respondents, less the 143 HGEs studied here. Total ranking variances (2 ) from the best practices standards
were developed for each of the three scenarios for each
of the 143 respondents. The three total variances for
each participant were averaged and reversed to measure
practical intelligence (CR = 073).
(3) Analytical Intelligence AI was measured with a
Bieri et al. (1966) cognitive complexity grid. Respondents are asked to evaluate six people they knew (e.g.,
closest friend, person to avoid, father) on a ﬁve-point
scale ((1) extremely low, (5) extremely high) over six
characteristics (e.g., responsible, excitable, dull). Differences between the ratings are summed to indicate
the test-taker’s range of evaluation, and a high total
score indicates an ability to analyze (i.e., differentiate)
a situation into many constituent elements. The sum of
the differences across the ratings is our single measure
of AI. Previous tests had test-retest reliability of 0.82
(p < 001) (Hitt and Tyler 1991).
(4) Creative Intelligence was measured with 30 associative word problems from Mednick’s (1968) Remote
Word Association Test (RAT), as extended by Bowden
and Jung-Beeman (2003). RAT measures divergent and
creative thinking by testing individuals’ ability to see
associative concepts among 30 sets of three words
(e.g., Water Tobacco Stove = Pipe). RAT is a commonly used measure of creativity and has been shown
to correlate with supervisor ratings of creativity (Fong
2006). Bowden and Jung-Beeman extended the original
30 word problems to 144. We selected 30 items that
demonstrated high reliability in a questionnaire setting

and used the number answered correctly as our single
indicator of creative intelligence.
5 Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy ESE. We used
the 22-item scale developed by Chen et al. (1998) to
measure ESE (CR = 084). The 22 items refer to an
individual’s ability to perform entrepreneurial tasks (e.g.,
marketing, innovation, management, risk taking, and
ﬁnancial control). Each item was measured on a ﬁvepoint Likert scale ranging from (1) completely unsure
to (5) completely sure. The ESE score is the average
response for the 22 items.
6 Swift Action SA was measured with responses
to three scenarios (technology adoption, new product
development, and market development) (CR = 078).
Participants were asked to circle the approximate number of days (2	 5	 10	    	 180 more) it would take to
choose from an array of possible improvement actions
and to begin trial or revision improvement actions.
Responses were reversed and mapped to a 10-point log
scale (1 = 180 days to begin and 10 = 1 day to begin).
(7) Multiple Improvement Actions MIA was measured with eight Likert-type response scales (CR = 081)
based on Miner et al. (2001) and discussions of change
behaviors with 10 founders. Typical statements were:
“We frequently experiment with product and process
improvements.” “Continuous improvement of our products and processes is a priority.” Each item was measured on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from (1)
strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. Scoring was the
average response.
Controls. Seven controls were included to clarify the
relations among the independent and dependent variables (Composite reliabilities and research sources are
reported on Table 1): (1) Emotional intelligence was
measured with 15 self-report measures of self-awareness
and self-management. (2) Social intelligence was also

<-----Page 8----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs

405

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

measured with 15 self-report measures of social awareness and social relationship management. (3) Size of
the venture was represented as the number of full-time
employees at the end of 2001. (4) Age of the ﬁrm was
measured in 2001 as the number of years since founding. (5) Regional dynamism was measured with 5 Likert
response format statements that assessed the predictability in the rate of change in regional growth rates over
ﬁve years. (6) Past venture growth was measured with
two items: (a) percent growth in revenues and (b) percent
growth in employment during 2000. (7) External ﬁnancing was measured as the percentage of the total capital
used that is provided by any external source (friends
and family, banks, governments, angels, middle-market
private equity sources, or other institutional sources).
Importantly, all companies in the study are independent
ventures.
Measurement Model Validity
LISREL 8.80 and PRELIS 2 were used to evaluate
concept validity (i.e., “composite reliability,” convergent, and discriminant validity) and perform a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the validity of
the proposed conﬁguration of causal concepts (Joreskog
and Sorbom 2006). The measurement model (Table 1)
shows that the theoretical model had 10 concepts with
CR > 080 and 4 concepts with CR between 0.70 and
0.79. All measure coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant (t > 20;
p < 005); thus, claims of convergent validity were supported. Discriminant validity was veriﬁed for each latent
variable because the average variance extracted by the
latent variable’s measures was larger than the latent
variable’s shared variance with any other latent variable. Discriminant validity is also supported because,
as shown on Table 2, no bivariate polychoric correlation in excess of 0.45 exists between predictor concepts (Fornell and Larcker 1981) except the correlation
between SI and its component, PI. Common source bias

On Table 2, we show the polychoric correlations of PI,

was checked with LISREL conﬁrmatory factor analysis by linking a common latent variable with the scalebased self-reported measures. The resultant coefﬁcient
LAMBDA = 004 (t = 026, p < 005) indicates a common variance of <2%. In summary, the measurement
model exhibited reliable measurement of the latent concepts, convergence of the measures of each concept, and
divergence of the concepts.
The statistical similarity of the PI, AI, SA, and MIA
responses across the three-year period was analyzed utilizing univariate homogeneity testing of the response
pairs (PRELIS 2 HT: Aish and Joreskog 1990). We
could not test the stability of CI, EMO, SOC, or ESE,
because measurement occurred during 2006–2007. For
the remaining concepts except PI, no chi-square had
p < 005, and the average was p = 042, which supports our claim that the CEO responses for AI, SA,
and MIA were stable across a three-year period. The
three scenario measures of PI grew over time, which is
expected, because tacit knowledge increases with experience; however, the differences across starting and ending measures were not signiﬁcant for two of the three
measures. We also used multiple sample analysis (LISREL MSA) of the 143 CEO latent-variable matrices to
analyze the similarity of covariance matrices across the
two samples (Joreskog and Sorbom 2006). We set the
lambda, iota, and theta matrices equal to zero for both
samples, which forced variance into the phi matrix. We
then tested the hypothesis that the phi matrices were
equal by minimizing the ﬁt function across the two. Chi
Squared 5	 N = 2 = 644 resulted. With the equality
constraint relaxed, the chi-square value dropped to 3.22,
so the hypothesis of equal latent-variable relationships
for AI, SA, and MIA was tenable.

Table 2 shows that PI, AI, and CI are signiﬁcantly correlated with NVG, but that SI (as calculated through LISREL CFA) is more strongly correlated with NVG, than
any other component alone. This supports Sternberg’s
assertion that SI is a more useful reﬂection than any set
of its components (1997, 2004).
We draw on moderated regression and structural equation analysis because our model includes moderation and
mediation. As shown in Table 3, we used three moderated regressions as the initial test of H1, H2, H3, and H4
(the relations between SI × ESE, SA, MIA, and NVG)
because structural equation modeling (SEM) is not well
suited to testing relations with interaction terms. However, we follow the results of our moderated regression
testing with a constrained SEM test of the integrated
model. We do this (1) to develop standardized coefﬁcients across the regressions that involve three dependent
variables, (2) to evaluate the overall contribution of our
internal path explanation versus the contribution offered
by the direct relationships between SI and NVG, and (3)
to conﬁrm Sternberg’s (1997) conﬁguration of SI.
Relation of SI × ESE with SA (H1) and
of SI × ESE with MIA (H2)
Table 3 shows the moderated regression results for tests
of the proposed links between SI and NVG: (H1 to

H4). The regression of SI and ESE on SA (Step 1-top)
demonstrates that the ﬁrst condition for moderation is
met: Both SI and ESE are signiﬁcantly related directly
with SA. As shown in Step 2-top, the second condition
is met because the addition of the product term reduces
both prior direct relationships, and the product variable,
SI × ESE, is signiﬁcantly related with SA. This supports H1. Similarly, and as shown in Steps 1-middle and
2-middle, SI × ESE is signiﬁcantly related with MIA
over and above the direct relations of SI and ESE with
MIA. This supports H2. In summary, the interaction of
successful intelligence and entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
is signiﬁcantly related to both SA and MIA.
Relation of SA and NVG (H3) and
MIA and NVG (H4)
New venture growth is the dependent variable for the
regressions shown at the bottom of Table 3, wherein
we test H3 and H4 (SA and MIA predict subsequent
NVG and they mediate the positive relation between
SI × ESE and NVG). Step 1 is the benchmark “controls
only” regression. Social intelligence (SOC), regional
dynamism (DYN), and past venture growth (PVG) have
signiﬁcant relations with NVG. In Step 2-bottom, SI and
ESE are added to the regression. With controls in place,
SI and ESE are signiﬁcantly related with NVG, and the

<-----Page 10----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs

407

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

signiﬁcance of the controls is reduced (i.e., SI and ESE
dominate the effects of emotional intelligence and social
intelligence). This regression provides a benchmark in
terms of explained variance for comparison with the
alternative internal explanations of NVG (that SI × ESE
relates with SA and MIA, which, in turn, predict NVG).
In Step 3-bottom, SI × ESE is added to the regression. Explained variance is signiﬁcantly improved by the
introduction of SI × ESE over SI and ESE alone, which
demonstrates that the moderation effects (SI × ESE) are
important even in a direct relation with NVG. In Step 4,
the direct effects of SA and MIA are added to the regression. The coefﬁcients of SI, ESE, and the interaction of
SI × ESE become insigniﬁcant, and SA and MIA are
strong predictors of subsequent NVG. In Step 5-bottom,
SI, ESE, and SI × ESE are trimmed (insigniﬁcant variables removed) to demonstrate that the best relation with
NVG among the array of independent variables is the
direct relation of SA and MIA with NVG. (Adjusted
R2 F  = 036 1400∗∗ .) This supports H3 and H4, in
that SA and MIA are probably mediators of the relation
between SI × ESE and NVG. Because it is impossible
to simultaneously regress SI × ESE on SA and MIA and
regress SA and MIA on NVG, we use SEM to improve
our conﬁdence in H3 and H4, the mediation hypotheses.
Composition of SI, Conﬁrmation of H3 and H4,
and Coefﬁcients of Theoretical Model
We tested a structural equation model (SEM) of the overall theoretical model (1) to understand the composition
of SI (and establish a benchmark “ﬁt” for comparison
with the theoretical model), (2) to conﬁrm H3 and H4,
and (3) to integrate the three regression models so that
we can quantify the relations shown in Figure 1. We followed Ping (1998) to constrain the loadings and error
variances of the product factors by using the reduced
constraint options of LISREL 8.8. We centered the variables that were not standardized, separated the measurement model analysis, trimmed variables that had not
achieved signiﬁcance in the multiple regressions, used
single indicators of latent variables, and transformed
data to achieve normality assumptions. Subgroup analysis and convenience variables were not used because we
had reliable regressions (Wong and Long 1987).
Column 1 of Table 4 shows the results of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis of the relation of SI and NVG and the
relation of the components of SI (PI, AI, and CI) with SI.
The ﬁt of the CFA was acceptable (X 2 129	 n = 143 =
22575; GFI = 090; AGFI = 087; RMR = 0074; and
RMSEA = 0053) (Joreskog and Sorbom 2006), so we
have conﬁrmation of Sternberg’s (1997) theory that SI
is composed of PI, AI, and CI. The coefﬁcients of the
paths to SI are: PI = 030∗ , AI = 016∗ , and CI = 021∗ .
SI is composed approximately of 47% PI, 33% CI,
and 19% AI. Of course, the true relationships among the
components of SI depend on the quality of the measures.

Because the measurement of PI was situationally speciﬁc and the measurement of AI and CI was general, PI
had an advantage in terms of its importance among the
components of SI. Thus, interpretation of the composition of SI should be guarded. Nevertheless, our results
conﬁrm Sternberg’s view that all three components are
important for successful intelligence.
In Column 2 of Table 4, we show the results of a
SEM solution involving only the relation of SI, ESE,
and SI × ESE with NVG and the controls. Only signiﬁcant coefﬁcients are shown on the table or Figure 1. ESE × SI developed a signiﬁcant coefﬁcient, SI
was near signiﬁcance, and ESE was not signiﬁcant.
The ﬁt is “fair” (X 2 135	 n = 143 = 25650; GFI =
086; AGFI = 084; RMR = 0084; and RMSEA =
0067). The outcome affords a comparison with the test
of the theoretical model shown in Column 3. The ﬁt
of the theoretical model is “good” (X 2 127	 n = 143 =
20320; GFI = 094; AGFI = 091; RMR = 0069; and
RMSEA = 0044) and signiﬁcantly better than the SI ×
ESE to NVG relation. The good ﬁt enables us to interpret the standardized coefﬁcients as reﬂections of the relative importance of the concepts, if we assume equally
good measurement across the concepts. The better ﬁt of
the Column 3 versus the Column 2 model conﬁrms that
the theoretical model is a better reﬂection of the relation
between SI and NVG than a model with ESE, SI, or
SI × ESE alone. In short, SI and ESE interact to create
a force that is mediated by SA and MIA, which in turn
improves subsequent NVG. H3 and H4 are conﬁrmed.
Intelligence is one of the many antecedents of selfefﬁcacy (ESE) (Bandura 1997, Phillips and Gully 1997),
so we were concerned that mediation of the relationship
between SI and behaviors might be a more appropriate
role for ESE. Thus, we removed SI×ESE from our SEM
and inserted paths from SI to ESE and from ESE to SA
and MIA to create a mediation (indirect effects) model.
The resulting X 2 128	 n = 143 = 21244/df was significantly greater than that developed with the theoretical
model. Thus, a mediation conﬁguration is not a better
representation of the role of ESE than moderation.

Discussion

The most important contribution of this study is
the speciﬁcation and conﬁrmation of the relationship
between successful intelligence and new venture growth.
Entrepreneurs’ intelligence had not received much attention from researchers because few consider intelligence
improvable. However, our focus on successful intelligence, which is responsive to training and practice,
and our speciﬁcation of the way SI impacts NVG,
points to new research possibilities. Our ﬁnding that SI
works through moderation by ESE (conﬁdence about
resource sufﬁciency) and mediation by two newly developed entrepreneurial behaviors adds three concepts and

trimmed from the SEM studies because they had insigniﬁcant coefﬁcients in the regression solutions (Wong and Long 1987).

a complex conﬁguration to researchers’ resources for
study of entrepreneurs and their ventures. Our third
contribution is that we conﬁrmed Sternberg’s (2004)
untested assertion that PI, AI, and CI are each necessary
components of SI, and we developed a way to measure
PI in a ﬁeld study.
A Moment in an Iterative Process
Our model is recursive. It represents only one moment in
a process that involves a bundle of situationally speciﬁc
intelligence, motivation (self-efﬁcacy), behavior, and performance. We believe that successful entrepreneurs are
embedded in a cyclical pattern of swift multiple improvement actions (say, market introduction), monitoring of
market reactions, venture growth (or not), and reconﬁguration of goal-driven actions that repeat. In the ideal
case, each cycle provides an experience that adds to
the entrepreneur’s practical intelligence, creative intelligence, self-efﬁcacy and so on.
To broaden understanding of how this extension of
our model works, and to inspire future research, we
offer our opinions about the antecedents and outcomes

of each of the model concepts. The existing recursive
model explains how SI and ESE relate to SA and MIA
and how SA and MIA drive NVG, but to understand the
cyclical model, we need to understand how SA, MIA,
and NVG impact SI and ESE. Much of our story draws
on the importance of situationally speciﬁc experience
and hands-on learning styles, which are core antecedents
of PI. We propose that the relevant experience for development of PI is new venture experience and related
industry experience. Each cycle creates another venture
experience in the industry of interest, which adds to
the entrepreneur’s PI. External factors such as vicarious
learning may also impact intelligence.
CI is developed through experience too, but to a lesser
extent than PI. Although there is a debate about the
ability to develop creativity, an industry has developed
around creativity training. Whatever the degree of nature
(versus nurture) in development of creative intelligence,
we suggest that situationally speciﬁc experience and
learning enhance development of situationally speciﬁc
CI just as they enhance PI. Thus, each cycle of SA,
MIA, and NVG yields a concrete tested experience that

<-----Page 12----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, © 2010 INFORMS

may guide creative development of new options through
avoidance of mistakes or ampliﬁcation of successes to
build CI.
In contrast, most folks believe that AI is a natural
personal resource. Indeed, it is the stability of “g” that
leads most to miss the explanatory possibilities of various speciﬁc intelligences such as practical intelligence
and creative intelligence. However, we agree that practice
and education make only moderate improvements in AI.
Thus, the primary gains in SI from cycles of SA, MIA,
and NVG are in two of the SI components, PI, and CI.
ESE reﬂects the belief that an individual has everything needed to accomplish a speciﬁc task. Like PI
and CI, ESE is situationally speciﬁc. We suggest that
increased SI is a resource that enters the efﬁcacy selfevaluation, so increased SI will increase ESE. Increased
NVG may impact ESE directly because success builds
conﬁdence (a belief). Thus, we expect that SI and NVG
impact ESE.
SA (swift action) is associated with people who are
high in traits such as proactivity, aggressiveness, and
risk taking. Traits are not easily developed, so SA may
be difﬁcult to change. Nevertheless, SA may be learned
directly through experience as cycles of fast action are
reinforced with success through high NVG; however, the
effect is already well represented as a path through SI
and ESE. To explain, successful SA creates an experience that enhances PI, CI, and ESE. Heuristics, routines,
“street smarts,” and creativity may be improved, thereby
increasing SI. As SI improves, so does ESE, and ESE
may be impacted directly, as explained above. The interaction of higher SI and ESE raises SA.
MIA is a behavior that may also be natural because
some people hold goal orientation, creativity, and proactivity as traits. All are factors in the development
of MIA; however, MIA may be learned directly as
entrepreneurs watch successful peers experiment and
improvise and develop routines of their own. Nevertheless, we point to SI and ESE, as modeled, for the
explanation of the development of MIA. PI involves
“know-how,” which is a store of alternate solutions and
evaluations for a problem. CI enables development of
optional problem solutions, and AI enables fast evaluation of experimental outcomes against goals, all of which
increase SI, which, through its interaction with ESE,
impacts MIA. Therefore, part of MIA may be innate, but
our model explains a path of development of MIA.
In summary, SI × ESE enables SA and MIA, and SA,
MIA, and NVG are partial inputs for development of SI
and ESE. Thus, the model represents only one moment
in a circular process.
Two New Conceptions of Entrepreneurial Behavior
Our second contribution is that we developed two behavioral concepts that predict a venture outcome and validated associated measures. First, we explored social

409

cognition theory (Fiske and Taylor 1991) and strategic
management researchers’ descriptions of fast thinking
to deﬁne and measure swift action (SA). Twenty-two
paid practitioners guided the creation of measures of SA.
We experimented with self-evaluation, structured expert
interviews, peer evaluation, and scenario-response measures. Ultimately, scenario responses were selected for
measurement because results were consistent with the
structured expert interviews and peer evaluation, and
because scenario-response measurement can be embedded in a questionnaire to gain a large sample.
Second, we derived a deﬁnition and measurement
of multiple improvement actions (MIA—repeated goaldriven revisions) from organization research about
change behaviors. Performance-oriented research about
improvisation, experimentation, adaptation, ﬂexibility,
bricolage, trial and error, and goal setting was reviewed.
Each concept was deconstructed, and 11 characteristics were identiﬁed (trials, monitoring, revision, goals,
planning, controls, situational triggers, follow-up, extemporaneity, solution novelty, and resource availability).
Dominant characteristics (trials, revision, and goals)
guided creation of the MIA label. Paid practitioners (22)
were engaged to derive the characteristics that formed
the eight Likert questions used herein. Hopefully, our
conception of MIA will encourage convergence among
researchers who champion one of the change behaviors
that were a basis for our conception.
The statistical signiﬁcance of SA and MIA in our
study is not surprising. Among personal characteristics,
behaviors are closest to outcomes in terms of causality.
Nevertheless, our identiﬁcation of behaviors such as SA
and MIA that are responses to the entrepreneur’s speciﬁc
situation may inspire organization and entrepreneurship
researchers to study other domain-related behaviors such
as networking and exploration of exit-related actions.
Components of SI Conﬁrmed
Sternberg emphasized that none of the components of
SI is adequate in itself (2004), but this assertion had not
been tested. Thus, our third contribution is that we provided empirical evidence that all three components of
Sternberg’s triarcic construct (PI, CI, and AI) are important for successful intelligence (SI). Sternberg did not
include other speciﬁc intelligences such as social intelligence (SOC) and emotional intelligence (EMO) in his
conﬁguration of SI; however, both additional types of
speciﬁc intelligence have gained traction among other
theorists. Thus, we included SOC and EMO as controls
and found that SOC had a signiﬁcant relation with NVG
as shown on Table 3. Ultimately, the SOC relation was
dominated by the Sternberg’s SI components, but better
measures of SOC may exist.

PI Tested and Compared with
Other Mental Structures
We also extended Sternberg’s (1995b) laboratory
methodology for measuring PI and used it in a ﬁeld
study. We drew on 22 practitioners to help us develop
scenarios that were used to test the practical intelligence of 746 participants. Expert action protocols were
extracted from the 10% most successful participants
to form an expert panel that yielded a ranked optimum solution that was a point of comparison with our
sample. Indeed, our successful use of (1) this methodology to measure PI in a ﬁeld study, (2) the Bieri et al.
(1966) cognitive complexity grid to measure AI, and (3)
enhanced RAT formats to measure CI in a ﬁeld study
may inspire researchers to conduct further empirical
studies of SI. (Other researchers might measure AI with
SAT scores or Mensa admission IQ tests. CI might be
measured with drawings or stories that are scored by
expert panels.)
Previously, we pointed to similarities between PI and
expert ability scripts. In summary, both PI and expert
ability scripts are mental compressions of experiences
including sequences of events about well-known situations. However, unlike scripts, which can be conceived
as discrete “molecular” tacit behavior patterns that turn
on or off by relevant cuing, PI operates at a “molar”
level of action. Nevertheless, it may be useful to compare the results of our study with expert ability scripts
as measured by Mitchell et al. (2000) in place of PI.
PI has also been compared with other types of mental
structures. “Schema” are more general knowledge structures than PI. They describe scripts that do not reﬂect
expertise, heuristics, and biases (expert scripts are a
special type of schema that are speciﬁc in terms of
knowledge). In contrast with PI, schema include broad
categories such as person, self, and role. “Heuristics”
are “rules of thumb” that may or may not be competencies like PI and expert scripts. Some entrepreneurship researchers have studied heuristics called “biases”
that reﬂect preferences or leaning. Sternberg’s (1995a)
conception of PI is not speciﬁc about how preferences
affect PI; so, our measurement of PI did not involve
imagery that would suggest partiality or inclination.
Overall, scripts, schema, heuristics, biases, and practical intelligence describe the same basic phenomenon—
mental packets of thinking that are available in a ﬂash;
however, the focus of each term is different. Thus, other
studies may gain from substitution for PI.

guidance for classroom exercises that may help students improve their venturing competencies. Sternberg’s
explanation that situationally speciﬁc experience and
learning are the foundation of SI suggests that educators could encourage relevant venture and industry
experiences inside and outside the classroom. Teachers
might explain that fast entrepreneurial action is important in new ventures because information is scarce and
competitive challenges are fast moving. Simulations that
encourage swift action (SA) and repeated goal-driven
revision (MIAs) may be helpful.

A Practical Model
All of the concepts in our model are measurable.
Financiers, and entrepreneurs themselves, can use our
model to guide informal assessment of entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurial teams during interviews, analysis of references, and informal due diligence. Our study offers

Opportunities Related to Conﬁgurations. It may be
that SA and MIA interact. We modeled the two behaviors selected to complete the link with NVG as separate
direct mediators of SSE × PI and NVG. Shimizu and Hitt
(2004) describe behavior that is related to SA and MIA as
a solitary concept—strategic ﬂexibility. Thus, it may be

Limitations and Other Research Possibilities
Founders as Self-Reporting Subjects. Study of founders may not yield accurate reﬂections of the successful intelligence used in a ﬁrm because founders may be
replaced. However, Beckman and Burton (2008) illustrated that founders leave a lasting imprint on ﬁrm
outcomes. Nevertheless, it may be useful to substitute
aggregate responses of entrepreneurial teams for the
individual responses used here.
Measuring Practical Intelligence. Social psychologists had successfully used expert panel techniques, such
as those that we applied to measure PI but only in laboratory studies and without a focus on organizational performance. We were concerned about our selection of an
expert panel from a context that was partly different than
the context of the study participants. Recall that we studied founders of the youngest printing industry companies, who also had high-growth goals. To maximize the
sample size of our study group, we drew our expert panel
by removing the study group from the population and
selecting the top performers from the remainder. Scenario responses of the study group were compared with
responses of the expert panel to measure PI. In short,
we compared responses from our HGE study group with
responses from CEOs of the fastest-growing established
companies. Thus, the experts were more experienced and
older than the study sample participants, and their companies were larger. We believe our choice was not threatening because many of the larger and older company
CEOs had been founders and had faced similar challenges. Nevertheless, we subsequently tested our model
using the top 15 performers from our sample to form
the expert panel. Three SEM and two regression coefﬁcients were no longer signiﬁcant because of the reduced
sample size, but we found no relative differences in the
coefﬁcients that would change our conclusions.

<-----Page 14----->Baum and Bird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs

that SA and MIA interact to drive subsequent new venture growth, and we propose such an interaction study.
As explained in “Theory,” moderation (interaction)
is the most logical intervening role for ESE in the
path between SI and behaviors because without conﬁdence about the sufﬁciency of resources, few potential
entrepreneurs would act. Furthermore, we expected—
and experienced—strong direct effects for SI with NVG
that would not be transmitted completely by ESE. However, ability (SI) is one of the many antecedents of selfefﬁcacy (ESE) (Bandura 1997, Phillips and Gully 1997),
so we tested a model with ESE as mediator of SI and
SA/MIA. As explained in results, the resultant ﬁt was
poor compared with the theoretical model. However, our
use of ESE, rather than a general form of self-efﬁcacy,
may produce results that differ from a study that involves
general self-efﬁcacy.
Learning Antecedents of SA and MIA. It may be that
SA and MIA are impacted by cognitive concepts other
than SI and ESE. For example, studies of Kolb’s (1984)
learning styles point to relationships between (1) concrete experience and (2) active experimentation learning orientations and entrepreneurial behavior (Corbett
2007). Future studies may wish to focus on learning as
an antecedent of SA and MIA.
Conclusion
Foust (2007) pointed to repeated evidence of fast experimentation among Business Week’s 2006 “Best Performers.” This public observation of the importance of swift
multiple improvement actions, together with the results
of this study, offers hope that dynamic capitalism can
be improved through understanding of successful intelligence and its links with new venture growth. Similarly,
we hope that our successful study of intelligence and
related behavior inspires research beyond the venture
setting. The concepts used here can be developed and
measured so entrepreneurs, ﬁnanciers, and teachers can
use our study to build entrepreneurial competencies and
to allocate ﬁnancial resources more efﬁciently.
