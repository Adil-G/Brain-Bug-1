THE RISK-BASED VIEW OF TRUST:
A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

ABSTRACT: Trust and risk have often been linked in the literature, but their
relationship is far from clear. Trust has been used in three different ways —
namely, as a perception (‘‘subjective trust’’), as various personal and situational
factors that lead to subjective trust (‘‘trust antecedents’’), and as the actions
resulting from subjective trust (‘‘behavioral trust’’). We explain how risk is related to these three conceptions of trust. First, we argue that subjective trust and
perceived risk are in fact mirror images of each other. Second, we show how
behavioral trust can be viewed as risk taking, so that the causal relationship
between subjective trust and behavioral trust is similar to that of perceived risk
and risk taking. And third, we discuss the role of personal characteristics (such as
risk propensity and trust propensity) in the risk--trust relationship. We also develop a number of propositions based on our risk-based view of trust.
KEY WORDS: trust, risk--trust relationship; trust antecedents; subjective trust;
behavioral trust.

INTRODUCTION
Trust is a critical constituent of all human relationships, and has traditionally received considerable attention in the literature across many
disciplines. However, although substantial progress seems to have been
made in applying the concept of trust in a number of different areas, it is
somewhat disconcerting that we are far from achieving a clear understanding of what is meant by trust (Gambetta, 1988). Various conceptualizations of trust have been offered over the years, with definitions

covering notions as diverse as positive belief, personal trait, action,
situational feature, and social structure (see Hosmer, 1995; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). One construct that is increasingly being woven into the
conceptualization of trust is risk (Boon & Holmes, 1991; Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995). Some scholars believe that only in risky situations do
we need trust (Coleman, 1990; Deutsch, 1958), and that to trust someone
is to take risk with the trustee (Sabel, 1993).
This risk-based approach to trust is gaining increasing acceptance
among a number of theorists (Gambetta, 1988; Mayer et al., 1995; Ring &
Van de Ven, 1994). Williamson (1993), for instance, has argued that we
can actually treat trust as a subset of risk and thus limit using the term
trust. Although much work has been done on trust and risk, the nature
and extent of the relationship between the two constructs remain vague
— if not also problematic — in most research. Our purpose here is to
investigate trust as related to risk, and to attempt some clarity about the
subject by suggesting the specific, though complex, manner in which the
two concepts are related.
Given the multiple conceptualizations of trust, we first review the
literature on trust and risk. We propose a framework of three distinct,
but related views of trust — subjective trust, trust antecedents, and
behavioral trust. We then develop and analyze the complex relationships
between trust and risk. In doing so, we discuss how each of the three
conceptions of trust can be related to three different risk concepts —
namely, risk propensity, perceived risk, and risk taking.
TRUST AND RISK
Trust is one of the more frequently used and yet least understood of
significant concepts in the social sciences. It has been discussed in psychology (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Rotter, 1967, 1980), philosophy
(Baier, 1986), sociology (Barber, 1983; Luhmann, 1979; Shapiro, 1987),
economics (Arrow, 1974; Williamson, 1975), and organization theory
(Zand, 1972; Zucker, 1986). In recent times, we have witnessed a marked
escalation of interest in the subject (Creed & Miles, 1996; Das & Teng, 1998,
2001a; Gambetta, 1988; Hosmer, 1995; Hwang & Burgers, 1997; Jones &
George, 1998; McAllister, 1995; Nooteboom, 1996; Ring, 1996; Sheppard &
Sherman, 1998; Williamson, 1993). This is not surprising because, on the
one hand, the general level of trust seems to be eroding in U.S. society
(Fukuyama, 1995), due to factors like corporate downsizing, increasing
diversity of the population, and general suspicion about the characters and
doings of political leaders. On the other hand, we seem to be entering an age
demanding more trust within organizations (Handy, 1995; Kramer &
Tyler, 1996), between organizations (Moorman, Zaltman, & Deshpande,
1992), and in international affairs (Michalos, 1990).

The logic of risk, including uncertainty and probability, occupies an
important position in defining trust. Ironically, theorists are hardly in
agreement on the conceptualization of risk (Slovic, 1987). Nevertheless,
most definitions seem to suggest the following idea — uncertainty or
variance in outcomes (especially losses) of some significance (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979; Yates & Stone, 1992). While uncertainty refers broadly
to a condition of unsure outcomes, risk is ‘‘a condition in which the
consequences of a decision and the probabilities associated with the
consequences are known entities’’ (Baird & Thomas, 1985, p. 231). In this
sense, uncertainty may be regarded as part of the risk construct.
We list in Table 1 some typical definitions of trust, along with other
particulars that we will discuss later. It should not come as a surprise
that the risk concept has been explicitly or implicitly applied in many of
them. In fact, Bhide and Stevenson observe that ‘‘aside from risk-taking
... definitions and usages of trust in business have few common elements’’
(1992, p. 192).
Of course, many definitions of trust do not explicitly include a risk
component. However, implicitly the association can be found in terms
like confidence (Barney & Hansen, 1994), fear (Bradach & Eccles, 1989),
predictability (Gabarro, 1978), and likelihood (Madhok, 1995). Although
the word ‘‘risk’’ may not be there, a strong consensus in these definitions
is that trust is about future expectations (which by definition is uncertain
and risky). There are several ways the two concepts are related.
First, some scholars argue that only under conditions of risk is trust
needed (Boon & Holmes, 1991; Deutsch, 1960b; Schlenker, Helm, &
Tadeschi, 1973) — that is, there must be ‘‘uncertainty that hinges on the
choices made by others’’ (Sitkin & Roth, 1993, p. 369). In a similar vein,
Currall and Judge define trust as ‘‘an individual’s behavioral reliance on
another person under a condition of risk’’ (1995, p. 151). Second,
researchers also suggest that trust can be viewed as an attribute of risktaking behavior (Mayer et al., 1995). Indeed, ‘‘willingness to take risks
may be one of the few characteristics common to all trust situations’’
(Johnston-George & Swap, 1982, p. 1306). That is, a sense of trust
encourages risk taking by trustors. As Craswell observes, trust is often
used as ‘‘a noncalculative explanation for cooperative or risk-taking
behavior’’ (1993, p. 492).
Finally, some theorists have pointed out that trust itself represents
individuals’ perceptions of outcome probabilities. For example, Kee and
Knox define trust as ‘‘P’s [trustor’s] certainty or uncertainty about O’s
[trustee’s] trustworthiness’’ (1970, p. 359). According to this view, because both trust and risk deal with probability, they would tend to be
cognate concepts. Indeed, Coleman argues that since we need to incorporate risk into trust, ‘‘situations involving trust constitute a subclass of
those involving risk’’ (1990, p. 91).

Trust, as it stands, can be linked with risk in many different ways,
and that fact prompted Mayer et al. to conclude that ‘‘it is unclear whether
risk is an antecedent to trust, is trust, or is an outcome of trust’’ (1995, p.
711). Later in this article we address this point and attempt to clarify the
intimate relationship between trust and risk in a systematic manner.

TRUST ANTECEDENTS, SUBJECTIVE TRUST, AND BEHAVIORAL
TRUST
From our discussion thus far it is apparent that studies of trust have
benefited from the insights of a number of disciplines and perspectives.
Nevertheless, as the term trust is used in so many disparate ways, we
also suffer from the consequences of the indiscriminate use of the term,
ending up with much confusion rather than comprehension. To clarify
the concept without losing the richness, it is essential that we differentiate various trust components (Kee & Knox, 1970). As indicated in Table 1, we believe it is appropriate to group various definitions of trust in
terms of three underlying constructs — (1) trust as a perception (subjective trust), (2) as various antecedents to subjective trust (trust antecedents), and (3) as the actions resulting from subjective trust
(behavioral trust). Whereas one may consider some of the definitions as
combinations of perception and behavior, the results of the grouping in
the table broadly show that many definitions actually refer to either
antecedents or outcomes of trust. For example, when Currall and Judge
define trust as ‘‘an individual’s behavioral reliance on another person’’
(1995, p. 151), they actually refer to behavioral trust.
Furthermore, a number of theorists have proposed different types
and dimensions of trust. These trust types and dimensions can also be
categorized, we believe, into trust antecedent and subjective trust (see
Table 1). Some scholars have viewed these dimensions mainly in terms of
their sources and foundations (e.g., Barney & Hansen, 1994; Sheppard &
Tuchinsky, 1996) and development processes (Zucker, 1986). These definitions to the category of ‘‘trust antecedents.’’ Other scholars differentiate trust dimensions in terms of the characteristics of the trustee that
attract confidence, such as responsibility, competence, goodwill, judgment, and so on (e.g., Barber, 1983; Gabarro, 1978; McAllister, 1995).
They exemplify the category of ‘‘subjective trust.’’
Regarding subjective trust, it clearly refers to a psychological state
experienced by an individual. That is why most theorists agree that trust
is a perception about others in relation to oneself. Thus, we adopt the
definition of subjective trust suggested by Sitkin and Roth (1993, p. 368)
as ‘‘a belief, attitude, or expectation concerning the likelihood that the
actions or outcomes of another individual, group or organization will be

<-----Page 11----->96

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

acceptable or will serve the actor’s interests.’’ Note that this definition
does not refer directly to risk, so that risk is not already intertwined in
the trust definition. It helps, however, to clarify their relationship. We
use the term subjective trust to emphasize its perceptual aspect. Such a
usage is in line with those of some earlier authorities, in which subjective
trust is differentiated from behavioral trust (e.g., Doney, Cannon, &
Mullen, 1998). According to Kee and Knox, trust entails ‘‘two related
components — (1) the observable choice behavior, and (2) a subjective
state which underlies the manifest choice behavior’’ (1970, p. 365). The
two are also known as ‘‘trusting beliefs’’ and ‘‘trusting intentions’’
(McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998). Thus, ‘‘subjective trust’’ will
be differentiated clearly from its antecedent (‘‘trust antecedent’’) and its
behavioral outcome (‘‘behavioral trust’’).
In sum, it appears to us that subjective trust is frequently confused
with the other two concepts, namely, the personality and situational
characteristics that lead to subjective trust, and the behaviors resulting
from subjective trust. Furthermore, we not only need to differentiate the
three concepts, but also to integrate them. To that end, earlier theorists
(e.g., Kee & Knox, 1970) developed frameworks that differentiate and
integrate situational and personality characteristics as antecedents of
trust, subjective trust, and behavioral trust. Here, for purposes of
examining trust and risk, we develop an alternative framework based on
the role of risk (see Figure 1).
First, although there are a number of factors that can be considered
as antecedents to subjective trust (see Table 1), we highlight in the
framework one personality characteristic that is most directly linked to
subjective trust — the trustor’s trust propensity. As Deutsch points out,
‘‘the term ‘trust’ is often used to refer to the personality characteristics
that make a person ‘trusting’ and ‘trustworthy’’’(1960a, p. 124). While
‘‘trustor’’ refers to the trusting party, ‘‘trustee’’ is the party being trusted.
Scholars believe that both trustor’s and trustee’s characteristics influence the level of subjective trust (Driscoll, 1978). Although some studies
have identified the trustee’s personal attributes that make the individual
worthy of more or less trust (Butler, 1991; Gabarro, 1978), here we include only the trustor’s personality characteristics because our framework is from the perspective of the trustor.
According to Mayer et al. trust propensity refers to ‘‘a stable
within-party factor that will affect the likelihood the party will trust’’
(1995, p. 715). Their assertion is based on the research of Rotter, who
developed the Interpersonal Trust Scale and found that people are
fairly consistent in their ‘‘generalized expectancy that the oral or written statements of other people can be relied upon’’ (1967, p. 653). Rotter
(1980) and others suggest that people can be placed along a continuum
from high trust to low trust. In Bonoma and Johnston’s (1979) study,

high vs. low trust was viewed as part of a general decision making style
of individuals. Similarly, some other theorists (see Boon & Holmes,
1991, p. 195) believe that enduring personality factors influence individuals’ capacity to trust. In essence, individuals are viewed as different
in terms of their propensity to trust and such differences tend to be
robust across situations.
Second, many authors have suggested that the behavioral outcomes
of trust should be separated from subjective trust itself (Coleman, 1990;
Craswell, 1993; Gambetta, 1988). Thus, the behavioral manifestation of
trust — that is, behavioral trust — is defined as relying on, or being
vulnerable to, another party (Michalos, 1990; Moorman et al., 1992).
Such a behavioral outcome, or ‘‘the placement of trust,’’ is ‘‘an action on
the part of the trustee that would not have been possible otherwise’’
(Coleman, 1990, p. 97). In the literature, behavioral trust has also been
considered under the rubric of cooperation (Friedland, 1990; Gambetta,
1988; Powell, 1996; Sabel, 1993) and risk taking (Currall & Judge, 1995;
Kee & Knox, 1970; Luhmann, 1988).

We now turn to an examination of the relationship between trust
and risk. We begin our discussion with subjective trust and then proceed
to the rest of the framework.
SUBJECTIVE TRUST AND PERCEIVED RISK
Subjective Trust and Perceived Risk as Probabilities
It has long been recognized that trust cannot be understood without
reference to probabilities (e.g., Deutsch, 1960a; Kee & Knox, 1970).
Having trust in someone does not imply 100% confidence in that person
for any task and under any circumstance. Rather, subjective trust refers
to the assessment of probability that the person will perform as expected
(Gambetta, 1988). For example, when a person thinks about her trust in
a physician who is to perform a surgical procedure on her, it is usually in
terms of the percentage of success. Confidence is measured by percentage
because most of us understand that there is nothing that is 100% certain
in this world. Indeed, high levels of subjective trust only means that the
subject perceives the probability of having desirable performance from
the other party as pretty high. Coleman (1990) also treats all trust
strictly in terms of probabilities. In summarizing a wide variety of trust
perspectives in his edited volume, Gambetta (1988, p. 217) notes that
trust ‘‘is a particular level of the subjective probability with which an
agent assesses that another agent or groups of agents will perform a
particular action ... When we say we trust someone or that someone is
trustworthy, we implicitly mean that the probability that he will perform
an action that is beneficial or at least not detrimental to us is high enough for us to consider engaging in some form of cooperation with him.’’
We note, again, that subjective trust (and behavioral trust as a result) is
viewed in probabilistic terms.
Once we accept subjective trust in terms of probabilities, the concept
of risk becomes salient. The reason is that perceived risk is also the
subjective estimation of probabilities (Slovic, 1987). In economics and
psychology risk has traditionally been used as known probability, with
uncertainty as unknown probability (Yates & Stone, 1992). Although this
difference is oftentimes blurred, perceived risk is generally regarded as
calculative probabilities under conditions of uncertainty (e.g., Fischhoff,
1985; Luhmann, 1993). In addition, perceived risk is often defined as the
probability of unfavorable outcomes, since the common usage of the term
mostly refers to downside variances.
In brief, subjective trust and perceived risk can be jointly understood
within the rubric of probability estimates and that the two concepts describe probabilities with contrasting mentalities. While subjective trust
refers to assessed probability of having desirable action performed by the

<-----Page 14----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

99

trustee, perceived risk is assessed probability of not having desirable
results. Thus, subjective trust and perceived risk are like mirror images
of each other.
When we say that subjective trust and perceived risk are based upon
probabilities, we do not mean that outcomes are not relevant. In fact,
probabilities are meaningless if they are not attached to various outcomes. Assuming three possible outcomes, assessed probabilities can be
presented as follows: outcome A, probability a%; outcome B, probability
b%, outcome C, probability c%, or (100-a--b)%. In this sense, subjective
trust and perceived risk do include the magnitude of outcomes — they
should be viewed as assessed probabilities regarding various outcomes.
Some theorists (e.g., Coleman, 1990; Kee & Knox, 1970; Williamson,
1993) believe that trust can be viewed as a subclass of risk since trust
also deals with probabilities. Williamson (1993) contends that because
trust in economic transactions is often calculated, it is no different from
calculated risk. We extend this logic to personal trust and make the
explicit point that subjective trust and perceived risk represent de facto
the same underlying construct of probability estimates. In essence, both
deal with one’s estimation of probabilities in getting what is desired rather than what is feared, but with very different psychological orientations, i.e., positive and negative mindsets. Thus, a perception of low trust
necessarily implies a perception of high risk, and vice versa.
We should note that some researchers have argued that trust is not
necessarily about probabilities. When trust is associated with faith
(Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985), a positive perception may go beyond
empirical evidence and tend toward the dogmatic. It is in this sense that
Ring and Van de Ven differentiate a ‘‘risk-based view of trust’’ from a
faith-based view of trust (1994, p. 93). Ring (1996) later called the former
fragile trust and the latter resilient trust. A similar difference has been
suggested between conditional trust and unconditional trust (Jones &
George, 1998). Williamson (1993) also believes that personal trust — as
opposed to calculative trust — is not about probabilities. In our view,
however, such distinctions do not necessarily limit the risk-based view of
trust, because faith may be viewed as almost a zero-risk situation — that
is, one’s belief is so strong that the perceived probability of being disappointed is close to zero. Thus, this faith-based approach can be viewed
as a special case of a general risk-based view.
Scholars may also argue that people do not usually invoke probability estimates even regarding fragile or conditional trust. Whereas
probability estimates may not always arise consciously in a trusting
situation, they may operate at an unconscious level. Our intent here is to
recognize the unconscious calculations of people in an explicit manner.
This approach is common in the social sciences — such as in expectancyvalence and equity theories in motivation and the theories of risk taking.

The test lies in whether the proposed calculation patterns can be used to
explain observable behavior.
Although, conceptually, subjective trust and perceived risk have
often been treated as monolithic constructs in parts of the literature, we
need to recognize that both concepts have been demonstrated as being
multidimensional (Das & Teng, 1996; Rempel et al., 1985). If so, one
cannot easily assume that all these dimensions of trust and risk are
linked to each other in some simple, lock-step manner. Therefore, in
discussing the relationship of trust and risk, it would be less than precise
to conflate their various dimensions. Most studies on trust and risk do
not in effect recognize their dimensionalities, thereby ignoring the impact of the different saliencies of the constitutive dimensions of trust and
risk. We maintain that the overall mirror-image relationship between
trust and risk needs to be examined, refined, and specified. To do that,
the first step would be to identify the key dimensions of subjective trust
and perceived risk.
Dimensions of Subjective Trust
Theorists have proposed that subjective trust is not a unidimensional concept, so that it is necessary to differentiate various types of
trust (see Table 1). For example, Rempel et al. (1985) propose that trust
consists of three dimensions — predictability, dependability, and faith.
Scholars also suggest other dimensions of trust, including affect-based
and cognition-based trust (Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995) and
fragile trust and resilient trust (Ring, 1996). Gabarro (1978) maintains
that the bases of trust include character, competence, and judgment.
Also, whereas Zucker (1986) proposes that trust can be process-based,
characteristics-based, and institution-based, Sheppard and Tuchinsky
(1996) suggest a different set of three types — deterrence-based,
knowledge-based, and identification-based.
Furthermore, along with some other researchers who identify
dimensions of subjective trust in terms of its sources, Barber (1983) argues that trust in someone refers to the individual’s ‘‘responsibility’’ and/
or ‘‘competence.’’ Apparently, while responsibility of a person (the trustee) leads the trustor to believe in her goodwill or intention in the relationship, her competence leads the trustor to believe in her ability to do
whatever is expected of her.
Creed and Miles (1996) agree that ability and dependability are the
two distinct sources of trust. Similarly, Nooteboom suggests that ‘‘[t]rust
may concern a partner’s ability to perform according to agreements
(competence trust), or his intentions to do so (goodwill trust)’’ (1996, p.
990; emphasis in original). Since goodwill and competence represent two
independent sources of subjective trust, they contribute to subjective

<-----Page 16----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

101

trust in separate ways. A family friend may be perceived as highly
responsible and well intentioned, but not perceived as competent to be a
business partner. On the contrary, a stockbroker may be highly competent but one may have concerns about his goodwill, given his intention to
make as much commission as possible. In sum, subjective trust should be
considered in terms of the two distinct dimensions of goodwill and
competence.
Dimensions of Perceived Risk
Das and Teng (1996) propose that risk in interfirm cooperation
consists of two types — relational risk and performance risk. Using the
concepts in interpersonal or interorganizational relationships, relational
risk refers to the probability and consequences of a partner not fully
committing to a relationship and not acting in the manner expected.
Performance risk is defined as the probability and consequences of not
achieving the goals in a relationship, given good intentions and efforts of
the partner. These two types of risk are conceptually independent of each
other because they arise from two different kinds of sources. While
relational risk finds its foundation in conscious intentions of the partner
(Das & Teng, 2001b), performance risk lies either in the environment
(such as intensified competition or adverse regulations) or in the capabilities of the partner. In other words, relational risk represents the
hazard of willfully not performing as expected, and performance risk is
the hazard of not being able to achieve a goal, owing to certain constraints (such as a lack of competence). Along similar lines, Ring and Van
de Ven describe these two risk types, respectively, as ‘‘uncertainty
whether the parties will be able to rely on trust’’ and ‘‘uncertainty
regarding future states of nature’’ (1994, pp. 92-93).
Because both subjective trust and perceived risk are multidimensional, the mirror-image relationship we proposed earlier needs now to
be specified further. We will show that such a relationship exists only in
distinct pairs — that is, goodwill trust vs. relational risk, and competence
trust vs. performance risk. The relationships among the four dimensions
are shown in Figure 2.
Goodwill Trust and Relational Risk
The trustor assesses the trustee’s level of goodwill based on such
factors as the trustee’s good faith (Cummings & Bromiley, 1996) and
integrity (Mayer et al., 1995). Goodwill is the trustor’s belief about the
trustee’s intention as well as his willingness to act in the interests of
the trustor. When Bradach and Eccles define trust as ‘‘a type of expectation that alleviates the fear that one’s exchange partner will act

opportunistically’’ (1989, p. 104), they actually refer to goodwill. In this
sense, opportunism, or ‘‘self-interest seeking with guile’’ (Williamson,
1975, p. 9), can be considered as a lack of goodwill.
Since a perception of goodwill alludes to a high probability that the
trustee has good intentions in the relationship and will carry out in good
faith whatever is expected of him, the probability of his being opportunistic will be low. Keeping in mind that we defined relational risk as the
probability that the partners may not be fully committed to the relationship, the level of relational risk will also be low. Thus, goodwill trust
and relational risk are mirror images of each other, and their relationship is clearly inverse in nature. Nevertheless, such a relationship cannot be automatically ascribed to performance risk, which is the
probability that the results may turn out to be unsatisfactory, despite the
parties acting in good faith. Because factors influencing performance risk
are beyond the parties’ willingness and intentions, a perception of
goodwill cannot ipso facto lower the level of performance risk.
Proposition 1: Goodwill trust is related inversely to relational risk,
but not related to performance risk.
Competence Trust and Performance Risk
Competence trust is the probability that the trustor believes the
trustee has the necessary skills and abilities to carry out certain actions
and achieve desired results (Gabarro, 1978; Kee & Knox, 1970). Unlike
the dimension of goodwill — which is about the trustee’s intention and

<-----Page 18----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

103

integrity — competence refers to the trustee’s capability and technical
qualifications (Barber, 1983). Other terms used in the literature for this
notion of competence include ability and expertise (see Mayer et al.,
1995).
Because competence trust relates to the probability of having the
skills to get things done, it is the opposite of performance risk — which is
defined as the probability of not being able to get things done, given full
commitment of the trustee. Although performance risk is affected by
various factors in the environment, a lack of competence is its major
source. For example, when one perceives the level of a surgeon’s competence as high, one also believes that the level of performance risk in a
surgery as low. Similarly, when an insurance consortium believes in a
country’s established expertise in launching rockets, low premiums
would likely be quoted to reflect the perception that performance risk is
relatively low. Thus, everything else being equal, there is an inverse
relationship between the competence and the attendant performance
risk. On the other hand, we contend that there is no significant relationship between competence trust and relational risk, because relational risk is exclusively about the probability that the trustee may
harbor ill intentions and may not make the expected efforts.
Proposition 2: Competence trust is related inversely to performance
risk, but not related to relational risk.
According to Propositions 1 and 2, subjective trust and perceived risk
are mirror images of each other, but only when both their respective
dimensions are aligned as postulated. We have, thus, refined the extant
understanding of the trust--risk relationship by specifying that the mirror-image construction needs to be studied at the level of their two
respective dimensions.
In the sections that follow, we discuss behavioral trust, risk taking, a
risk perspective of subjective trust and behavioral trust, and the role of
trust propensity and risk propensity.
BEHAVIORAL TRUST AND RISK TAKING
Behavioral trust is the manifestation of subjective trust — that is,
the behavioral results of having subjective trust in someone (Craswell,
1993; Gambetta, 1988). In other words, behavioral trust is about the
notion ‘‘to trust someone’’ and it takes forms such as allowing the trustee
to perform certain tasks, furnishing critical information to the trustee,
placing resources at the trustee’s disposal, and so on. Thus, to trust is to
rely on the expected action of the trustee over which the trustor does not
have control (see, e.g., Currall & Judge, 1995; Michalos, 1990).

<-----Page 19----->104

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

Two points may be derived from this conceptualization. First, trust is
necessary only if adequate control is unavailable, for otherwise the action
cannot be deemed to be a result of subjective trust (Leifer & Mills, 1996;
Powell, 1996). Indeed, theorists (e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Das &
Teng, 1998, 2001a; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995) have suggested that
trust is a substitute for control in relationships. A lack of control points to
a lack of certainty about what the trustee might do. Thus, like subjective
trust, behavioral trust is relevant only if the element of uncertainty is
present.
Second, behavioral trust is about voluntarily being vulnerable to the
actions of the trustee (Mayer et al., 1995). The degree of vulnerability
thus reflects the amount of trust granted to the trustee — a high degree
of vulnerability implies a high level of subjective trust and a significant
trusting action. For instance, the question of lending $100 vs. lending
$100,000 (by the same lender) to somebody represents two very different
levels of vulnerability. By definition, vulnerability refers to the severity
of adverse outcomes or potential loss. Thus, the degree of subjective trust
one has and the degree of behavioral trust one places in the trustee are
also dramatically different. As we mentioned before, uncertainty and
adverse outcomes are the two key characteristics of the risk concept.
Thus, we believe that behavioral trust, like subjective trust, is closely
related to risk, and Mayer et al. have stated that ‘‘behavioral trust is the
assuming of risk’’ (1995, p. 724; emphasis in original). In Figure 1,
behavioral trust and risk taking are shown as connected, indicating that
behavioral trust inevitably invites risk taking.
SUBJECTIVE TRUST AND BEHAVIORAL TRUST: THE RISK-BASED
VIEW
Subjective Trust Leads to Behavioral Trust
We argued earlier for the need to differentiate trust as a perception
and trust as an action. With our conceptualization of subjective trust as
risk perception, we are now in a position to explain how subjective trust
leads to behavioral trust. Since we regard subjective trust in terms of
risk perception and behavioral trust in terms of risk taking, the relationship between subjective trust and behavioral trust is simply that of
perceived risk and risk taking — a perception of low risk leads to risk
taking.
Research has shown that, despite individual differences, people
generally are risk-averse — that is, they prefer low risk situations to
high risk situations (Bromiley & Curley, 1992; Lopes, 1987). Thus,
everything else (e.g., a person’s risk propensity) being equal, when one
believes that a certain task is less risky than another task, one would be

<-----Page 20----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

105

more willing to be engaged in that certain task. For example, when one
hears a stock market expert recommend a particular stock, one tends to
believe the risk involved to be low and thus may be willing to invest in
that stock. Economists have suggested that the expected utility of risk
taking (denoted as V) is a function of both probability (denoting probability of gaining as q) and outcomes (potential gain as G and potential
loss as B): V ¼ qG + (1 ) q)B. Thus, when perceived probability of losing
(1 - q) gets lower, the expected utility of risk taking (V) becomes higher so
that risk taking becomes more feasible. That is, when the probability of
losing is lowered, adverse outcomes become more bearable. It is important to note that whereas perceived risk often refers to downside probability — (1 ) q) in our definition — in calculating risk utility both
positive and negative consequences need to be considered. That is, risk
taking is intended both to achieve gains and to avoid losses. Along similar lines, Coleman (1990) suggests that the decision of whether to trust
depends on its expected utility. To use the above denotations, Coleman’s
position is that one would grant trust if qG is greater than (1 - q)B, or the
expected utility V is positive.
Dimensions of Behavioral Trust
We noted above the straightforward nature of the relationship between subjective trust and behavioral trust on the basis of perceived risk
and risk taking. Nevertheless, it is essential to separate the constitutive
dimensions of subjective trust and perceived risk. Generally, one’s perception of trust indicates that one’s perception of risk is low. Specifically,
a pronounced perception of goodwill leads to a low level of perceived
relational risk, and a strong perception of competence leads to a low level
of perceived performance risk. Ring and Van de Ven (1992) suggest that
the higher the level of trust, the less the inherent risk. While they seem
to be dealing with ‘‘objective risk,’’ we contend that a perception of trust
means simply that the person believes the level of risk is low — that is,
the perceived risk is low.
The perceptions of relational risk and performance risk, based upon
subjective trust, will influence one’s risk taking behavior, or behavioral
trust. It needs to be emphasized that behavioral trust can be defined in
terms of the relative prominence of relational risk and performance risk.
For any given scenario, behavioral trust is a combination of taking certain levels of relational risk and performance risk. Thus, particular
scenarios can be analyzed in terms of the types of risk that are taken
(Das & Teng, 1996). In some trusting scenarios, both relational risk and
performance risk may be substantially important, such as in the case of
trusting one’s business partner. Other trusting scenarios are characterized more by one type of risk, either relational or performance. Hence, in

<-----Page 21----->106

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

a given situation it is important to ask ‘‘What matters more, relational
risk or performance risk?’’ For example, whereas lending $100 to a friend
is more about taking relational risk (intention to pay back), lending
$100,000 to the same person to start a business may well be more about
taking performance risk (ability to pay back).
We further suggest that each dimension of subjective trust (goodwill
and competence) contributes to the taking of only one specific type of
perceived risk (relational or performance) — goodwill trust for taking
relational risk and competence trust for taking performance risk. Thus,
how relevant and important the two types of risk are with regard to a
specific trusting scenario becomes the critical question. If both types are
more or less equally important, then perceptions of both goodwill and
competence must be present to promote risk taking. Coleman (1990), in
presenting this rational approach to trust, provides several telling
examples. One of these involves a merchant banker who was requested
by a Norwegian shipowner to deliver £200,000 to an Amsterdam shipyard, so that one of his ships could be released at once. Without any
collateral — and based purely on personal trust — the banker furnished
the money. In this case, both goodwill trust and competence trust were
needed. The deal was completed over the telephone only because the
banker knew that the shipowner would be able to pay back the loan.
Thus, the probability of gain (q) was determined both by goodwill and
competence. Having information regarding these two dimensions greatly
facilitated the decision making process. In explaining his decision, the
banker observed: ‘‘I know the company, I know the ship, I even know the
cargo. It’s my job to know all these things’’ (Coleman, 1990, p. 103). The
banker seemed to have information relating to both goodwill and competence of the shipowner. To use the utility logic we presented earlier,
the banker granted trust because the positive value of expected gain (qG)
was greater than the negative value of expected loss [(1 ) q)B]. The
utility function based on two types of risk helps in predicting and analyzing the trusting behavior of the banker. Mixing the two dimensions or
missing one of them would result in misleading estimates. If relational
risk is the principal characteristic of a trusting situation, it is mainly a
perception of goodwill — not a perception of competence — that would
stimulate one to grant trust. In other words, the perception of goodwill of
the potential trustee — and consequently of low relational risk — would
prompt the trustor to grant trust in situations where otherwise trust will
not be granted.
The logic here is that once the more prominent risk is attended to,
trusting tends to be facilitated. Consider, for example, that you are asked
by your new neighbor Joe to loan him $1000 without any collateral.
Apparently, it would expose you to significant relational risk because you
are unsure about Joe’s goodwill and intention to pay back the loan

<-----Page 22----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

107

amount. Performance risk would not be a major concern here because Joe
should be able to repay the loan if he wants to. At this time, if your friend
Jim happens to mention that Joe is known for his honesty, your perceived relational risk would be lowered and thus you may well decide to
loan the money. On the other hand, if Jim informs you only that Joe
drives a luxury car, so that perceived performance risk is lowered, you
still may not loan the money because relational risk is what is prominent
here.
Proposition 3a: When a relationship is characterized mainly by
relational risk, it is the perception of the trustee’s goodwill that will
prompt the trustor to grant trust.
Conversely, in situations where performance risk is deemed as more
prominent (e.g., while hiring a defense lawyer), a perception of competence becomes the key ingredient for behavioral trust. Perception of
goodwill will not be that important when relational risk is believed to be
less critical. For example, it can be argued that the reason people often
elect legislators (bestowing behavioral trust) who are believed to be
wanting in goodwill is that performance risk — that is, whether or not
they would run the government effectively — is viewed as more critical
than relational risk — that is, whether or not they would act properly
according to accepted norms. Thus, the perception of a legislator’s deficiency in goodwill is often largely ignored, and the perception of his or
her competence conditions the risk taking.
Proposition 3b: When a relationship is characterized mainly by
performance risk, it is the perception of the trustee’s competence that
will prompt the trustor to grant trust.
RISK PROPENSITY AND TRUST PROPENSITY
In order to understand more comprehensively the relationship between trust and risk, it would seem worthwhile to discuss the two personality traits that are closely linked to the concepts we have just
discussed — individuals’ risk propensity and trust propensity (see Figure 1).
Risk Propensity and Behavioral Trust
In discussing risk taking and its determinants, risk propensity is a
key variable. While some theorists define risk propensity as one’s tendency to take risk that is affected by both personal traits and situations
(Das & Teng, 1997, 2001c; Sitkin & Pablo, 1992, p. 12), others define it as
a personal trait that is stable across situations (Schneider & Lopes,

<-----Page 23----->108

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

1986). Here, we regard risk propensity as a generalized personal trait, or
an individual’s general willingness to take risk. People can thus be differentiated as either risk-takers or risk-averters (Kogan & Wallach,
1964). Everything else being equal (e.g., risk perception), those with high
risk propensity are more likely to take risks, while those with low risk
propensity are less likely to do so.
Scholars have suggested that one’s risk propensity affects one’s
assessment of the situation, including the perception of risk (Brockhaus,
1980). Risk-takers tend to assign more importance to gains and less
importance to losses and thus underestimate the probability of losses or
perceived risk. Risk-averters, on the other hand, are preoccupied with a
concern for losses, so that they often overestimate the probability of losses
(Schneider & Lopes, 1986). Indeed, Sitkin and Weingart (1995) hypothesized a negative relationship between risk propensity and risk perception
— the higher one’s risk propensity the lower one tends to assess the riskiness of the situation — and found empirical support for the hypothesis.
In addition, many researchers agree that risk perception is critically related to risk taking (Weber & Milliman, 1997). Everything else
being equal, a perception of low risk leads an individual to undertake a
specific task whereas a perception of high risk discourages such action.
That is, when one does not see a task as very risky, one’s willingness to
undertake the task tends to be high. Sitkin and Pablo (1992) observe
that such a relationship is consistent with prospect theory (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979) --- which posits that decision makers become more
concerned with losing assets (risk avoiding) when there are prior gains
(a high risk perception). Therefore, there is a linear casual relationship
among risk propensity, risk perception, and risk taking (see Figure 1).
In other words, a high risk propensity leads to a perception of low risk,
which in turn leads to risk taking. Although the literature also suggests
a direct relationship between risk propensity and risk taking, Sitkin
and Weingart (1995) found that risk perception did play a mediating
role, while a direct link between risk propensity and risk taking was
not significant.
As we discussed earlier, risk perception can be considered as a
mirror image of subjective trust, and behavioral trust can be viewed as
risk taking. Therefore, the casual relationship among risk propensity,
risk perception, and risk taking can be considered, conceptually, as
tantamount to risk propensity, subjective trust, and behavioral trust.
That is, the trustor’s risk propensity accentuates the effect of risk perception in prompting behavioral trust.
Proposition 4: The higher the trustor’s risk propensity, the lower
will be the level of perceived goodwill and competence needed to grant
trust to a potential trustee.

<-----Page 24----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

109

Trust Propensity and Risk Propensity
Like risk propensity, trust propensity is yet another personal trait
that significantly influences an individual’s trusting behavior. We discussed this concept in detail earlier in the literature review section.
Rotter (1967) suggests that people have a generalized expectancy about
the general trustworthiness of other parties around them. Others (e.g.,
Dasgupta, 1988; Driscoll, 1978) also discuss such a generalized tendency
toward trust. Mayer et al. state that the propensity to trust is ‘‘a stable
within-party factor that will affect the likelihood the party will trust’’
(1995, p. 715). Against this background, and adopting Rotter’s (1967)
original idea, we define the term trust propensity as one’s personal tendency to believe in others’ trustworthiness. Trust propensity is one’s
likelihood of perceiving subjective trust regarding others, but not necessarily leading to any trusting actions. Currall and Judge found
empirically that ‘‘[t]he more A has a trusting personality, the greater A’s
willingness to engage in trusting behavior toward B’’ (1995, p. 155).
Hence, trust propensity in our model is the antecedent of subjective
trust. The higher the trustor’s trust propensity, the more likely he or she
will believe in the goodwill and competence of other parties. Whether or
not behavioral trust will be the result is a question that becomes relevant
only later.
We must note here the essential difference between risk propensity
and trust propensity. At the personal trait level, trust and risk do not
necessarily go in tandem. The reason is that, conceptually, trust propensity and risk propensity are independent constructs. While trust
propensity is about one’s general view of the level of uncertainty in
relationships around oneself, risk propensity is about how to deal with
these uncertainties in relationships. For example, individuals may have
a low propensity to believe in the goodwill and competence of others, and
yet have a high propensity toward taking risks in relationships. In this
case, they grant trust not because they believe in the trustworthiness of
others, but only because they are more willing to take such risks with
others.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We developed in this article a comprehensive and integrated riskbased view of trust. The risk perspective has a prominent place in the
extant literature on trust, but it suffers from being imprecise and fragmented. While some theorists emphasize that a risky situation creates
the need for trust (Deutsch, 1958), others regard risk taking a result of
trust (McAllister, 1995). Still another group of scholars believes that

<-----Page 25----->110

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

trust is essentially a subclass of risk, since both deal with uncertainty
and probability (Coleman, 1990; Williamson, 1993). Here, we have not
only further developed this last view, but have also integrated all three
views in our framework of trust and risk. In doing so, we first stressed
the need to explicitly differentiate various conceptualizations of trust.
Our literature review showed that the term trust can actually refer to
three altogether different concepts — an expectation, a behavioral outcome due to the expectation, and personal and situational characteristics
that lead to the expectation. To avoid confusion, we used three explicit
terms for these three conceptualizations of trust — subjective trust,
behavioral trust, and trust antecedents. We proposed qualitatively different kinds of relationships of trust and risk with these three basic
conceptions of trust.
We first argued that, at the subjective trust level, trust is not a
subclass of risk but rather a mirror image of risk. Unlike earlier
researchers, we did not rest with the conclusion that both concepts deal
with probability. In fact, both subjective trust and perceived risk represent the assessment of outcome probabilities of the same event. The
crucial difference is that, whereas subjective trust portrays the assessment in a positive light — that is, the probability that the outcome will be
what is desired — perceived risk describes the situation in disquieting
hues — the probability that the outcome will be what is feared. In
actuality, they are the mirror image of each other, evaluating the same
situation from two distinctly different perspectives of hope and concern.
By granting trust a comparable position with risk, our analysis should
help encourage the calculative school of trust to consider the value of a
more balanced and integrated discourse. A potential criticism of the
proposed mirror-image relationship is that it is not very meaningful to
point out theoretical opposites. For example, suggesting that dissatisfaction is the opposite of satisfaction does not help much. The key difference here, however, is that we are not merely identifying obvious
opposites. Rather, we are proposing that two very different constructs
(trust and risk) are actually theoretical opposites. Our approach, thus,
clarifies some of the theoretical ambiguities in the literature on trust and
risk.
Second, we explicitly differentiated the dimensions of subjective
trust and perceived risk and then identified the specific one-to-one inverse relationships between the specific dimensions of each construct.
Based on existing studies, we suggested that subjective trust covers both
goodwill and competence (Barber, 1983), and that perceived risk is
comprised of relational risk and performance risk (Das & Teng, 1996).
Once we differentiated these dimensions, it became evident that our
earlier assertion that subjective trust and perceived risk are mirror
images of each other could be made more precise. We argued that the

<-----Page 26----->T. K. DAS AND BING-SHENG TENG

111

mirror-image relationship exists only when we link goodwill trust with
relational risk, and competence trust with performance risk, respectively. We proposed a strictly inverse relationship between these two
pairs of dimensions.
Third, we offered an alternative explanation for the relationship
between subjective trust and behavioral trust. Some earlier studies
tended to assume that subjective trust leads to behavioral trust but
generally failed to offer an account of the process (Kee & Knox, 1970). In
this paper, we proposed an explanation that is entirely based on the risk
perspective. We concur with many scholars that behavioral trust is risk
taking. As such, the relationship between subjective trust and behavioral
trust is tantamount to, and can be substituted by, that of perceived risk
and risk taking. When we do this, the causal relationship becomes
obvious — a perception of low risk prompts individuals to take that risk.
To link this up with trust, the explanation is that a perception of trust
indicates a low level of risk, which then makes the subject more willing to
undertake the risk and thus grant trust. Such an explanation seems to us
to be conceptually clear, straightforward, and compelling. In addition,
the propositions developed here enable us to connect subjective trust,
perceived risk, and risk taking effectively.
As to the implications for future trust research, we demonstrated
that trust could be better understood as the mirror image of risk.
Although this calculative view of trust already exists in the trust literature, many theorists tend to believe that this view has serious
boundary problems. They believe trust may go beyond the calculative
sphere and become matters of faith and dogmatic beliefs. We maintain
that faith and affect can be viewed as special cases in the risk-based
view — representing a perceived near-zero risk situation. This view
challenges the more affective view of trust. One benefit of this calculative approach is that it is more quantifiable and makes rigorous
theorizing possible.
For instance, our risk-based view of trust helps in better understanding the normative value of trust. It is generally believed that trust
is valuable because it allows people to dispense with detailed contracts
and monitoring in various transactions. The result is lower cost and
higher efficiency. However, there is also the literature on property rights
that underscores the importance of a clear delineation of these rights
(Barzel, 1997). The logic is that adequate contracting provisions and a
clear delineation of property rights will reduce ambiguity and enhance
efficiency. In other words, a low trust route will be more efficient. These
two approaches to increased efficiency — based on, respectively, high
trust and low trust — would seem to directly contradict each other.
However, our risk-based view of trust helps in sorting through this
apparent dilemma.

<-----Page 27----->112

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY

In our view, minimum contracting and monitoring in transactions
connote a high level of risk taking. Because trust is the mirror image of
risk, a high trust situation suggests low perceived risk. When risk is low,
the more efficient approach is to go forward with risk taking because the
utility of risk taking is higher (see our earlier discussion on utility). On
the other hand, when trust is low, risk is perceived as high. The more
efficient approach here will be risk averting (again because of utility). In
this sense, a clear delineation of property rights reduces the level of risk
taking. The difference between the two views lies in the fact that the
property rights literature is conscious about the risk of trust. The insight
gained from our risk-based analysis is that the benefit of high trust
should compensate the implicit risk taking. This is true as well for faithbased and affect-based trust — both are subject to risk.
This risk-based view of trust is particularly relevant for managerial
practice. We believe that in business trust is conceived mainly in terms of
risk and less in terms of faith and affect. The view of the merchant
banker we discussed earlier is typical, in which trust was based solely on
the information he gathered over time. A healthy skepticism about faithbased trust in the workplace would not be ill-advised. A rational approach toward trust means that one should manage trust consciously. To
that end, our risk-based view of trust is more management-friendly than
the affective and other related views of trust.
Finally, regarding empirical testing of the framework and the
propositions, we believe that the key lies in developing satisfactory
measures for each the concepts. Current measures of trust do not focus
on the probability aspects of obtaining desirable outcomes. Our framework suggests that we need to also develop trust measures that are
explicitly risk-oriented.
Although we employed the risk-based view to examine different
views of trust and attempted to integrate trust and risk, there are other
areas that should be attended to in future research. First, our framework
is from the perspective of the trustor, rather than covering both the
trustor and the trustee. Our rationale is that risk is primarily a concept
associated with the trustor, who becomes vulnerable to potential actions
of the trustee. However, it is also true that the trustee has his or her own
share of risk, and it would be interesting to extend our approach to the
separate and distinct perspective of the trustee. Second, existing research indicates that the causal relationship between subjective trust
and behavioral trust may not be unidirectional. Also, to take risk and
trust somebody can boost mutual trust and confidence in the relationship
in later stages. In that sense, the choice and outcome of behavioral trust
may also contribute to the level of subjective trust. Such a looped and
evolving relationship could be further explored through the risk-based
view of trust.
