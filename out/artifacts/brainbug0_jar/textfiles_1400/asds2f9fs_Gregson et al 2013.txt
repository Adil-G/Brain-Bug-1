In this paper, we examine the evolution of risk capital markets in a small market economy,
with particular reference to business angel syndication. Scotland provides a valuable case,
where the number of business angel syndicates (BAS) has grown from 3 to 18 between 2001
and 2010, the most radical shift in market organisation of any region in Europe. Findings suggest that a narrow range of focused but integrated public policies can be very effective in risk
capital ‘capacity building’. Results suggest that syndication generates larger investment deals
and more follow-on investment but results in less new investments, fewer exits and an ‘equity
gap’ in the lower end of the market, suggesting the need for ongoing formation of new BAS and
greater emphasis on investment exits. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
The combination of equity ﬁnancing, venture capital
(VC) and business angel (BA), along with debt ﬁnancing and traditional bootstrapping initiatives (i.e. ‘3Fs’:
founder, family and friends) can be described as a
funding escalator, with different progressive stages of
venture growth associated with a particular source of
ﬁnance. This funding escalator does not function in the
same way across different regions, with some regions
characterised by a marked centralisation in the location
of both the supply of and the investment of institutional
VC and private equity. This has been a major issue in
countries such as Scotland, where institutional VC is
noticeably absent and where there has been increased
emphasis on the role of BA ﬁnancing in supporting the
development of a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.

In this study, we argue that a key section of the
market, BA ﬁnance, is evolving from a market characterised by solo investors and largely informal and
invisible investment groups to one increasingly
deﬁned by formalised investment groups and syndicates, which channel and consolidate investment
ﬁnance from individual investors to entrepreneurial
ventures.
Scotland provides a valuable case study to examine
this evolution in the risk capital market: ﬁrst, the number of identiﬁable business angel syndicates (BAS)
has grown sixfold in the last decade; second, the original business angel network (BAN), LINC Scotland,
has evolved from a traditional information sharing
introduction service to a network catalyst and development role, supporting the emergence of most new
BAS to be formed over the past decade; and third,
Scotland has been the locus of a number of policy evolutions designed to stimulate the evolution of the risk
capital market, notably a BA-oriented co-investment

fund that would not have been possible without this
network evolution.
Three main questions are addressed in this paper.
First, we will investigate the market demand and supply conditions that have shaped the risk capital market
in Scotland. Second, we examine key factors contributing to the proliferation of BAS activity over the past
decade. Third, we will qualify the effects of this BAS
growth on the risk capital market and on early-stage
investment. Here, we draw upon data from a 2-year
study of Scotland’s oldest and largest BAS, which
offers quantitative evidence of this impact.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows:
Section 2 offers related literature on the evolving nature
of risk capital markets, BA investment and the role of
public policy; Section 3 presents the research method
adopted; Section 4 presents and discusses our ﬁndings;
and Section 5 carefully explains the policy implications
of our ﬁndings and identiﬁes future research.

2. RELATED LITERATURE
In recent years, institutional VC investors have shifted
their investments away from early-stage ventures to
focus almost exclusively on more mature, far less
risky investment opportunities. Research by PWC
(2009) found that in 1995, 38% of VC investment
was in seed and early-stage companies. However,
by 2005, companies at these stages received only
19%. Another suggested reason for this shift is an
increase in deal sizes due to the growth in the size of
VC funds favouring later stage deals (Pierrakis and
Mason, 2008).
This shift in risk capital markets has contributed to
a growing equity gap for early-stage ventures. The
equity gap is deﬁned as ‘the absence of small amounts
of risk capital from institutional sources for companies
at the seed, start-up and early-growth stages which
arises because the ﬁxed costs of investment appraisal
and monitoring make it uneconomic for venture capital
funds to make small investments, and also because of
the reluctance of banks to make unsecured lending’
(Reid, 1998; Mason, 1996: p. 4).
A growing body of research highlights the prominent role played by BAs in closing this equity gap
by providing risk capital for the entrepreneurial and
innovative activity that underpins a high proportion
of economic growth (Wetzel and Freear, 1994; Mason
and Harrison, 1996; Morrisette, 2007). The term ‘business angel’ usually refers to high-net-worth individuals who make investments of time and money to
Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

help start-up companies through their initial stages of
growth (Lange et al., 2003). BAs are identiﬁed as a
class of investor that is the principal source of capital
at the seed and start-up stages of companies. Mason
(2009) suggests that BAs are able to address regional
gaps in the availability of ﬁnance because of the wide
distribution of BAs (Gaston, 1989) and the fact that
angels tend to invest locally, within 50–100 miles of
where they live (Harrison et al., 2003).
The impact of BA investment is highlighted in both
investment terms and in new job formation. The BA
market in the USA and UK has been identiﬁed as the
largest source of risk ﬁnancing for entrepreneurial
ﬁrms, exceeding the institutional VC industry (Pierrakis
and Mason, 2008; Sohl, 2008). Estimates in the UK and
the USA suggest that BAs annually fund two to ﬁve
times more money to entrepreneurial ﬁrms than the
VC industry (Wiltbank, 2009; Don and Harrison,
2006). Sohl et al. (2000) estimate that US BAs provide
close to 80% of the seed and start-up capital for high
tech entrepreneurial ventures. The European Venture
Capital Association (EVCA, 2008) estimates that one
million new jobs were created by European private
equity and VC-ﬁnanced companies between 2000 and
2004, with a signiﬁcant portion of this total arising from
angel investment. Sohl (2008) suggests that BAs created
200, 000 new jobs in the USA in 2007 or 3.3 jobs per
investment.
In recent years, BAN and BAS have become commonplace in markets where angel investors are highly
active. In the USA, the number of BA organisations
has grown from approximately 10 in 1996 to over
250 in 2005 (Preston 2007). Research by the European
Business Angel Network (EBAN) found that the number of BANs in Europe doubled between 1989 and
2000 from 66 to 132 and has risen steadily to reach
over 300 by 2008, because of the growth in BANs in
emerging markets of Eastern, Central and Southern
Europe (particularly Spain and Portugal) and in France
(EBAN 2008).
The EBAN study show a levelling-off of growth in
more mature markets, namely the UK (except Scotland),
Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.
This trend is suggested because of a gradual professionalism and consolidation of the BA industry in these
countries and the loss of poorly performing networks
over time (EBAN 2008). The EBAN study suggests that
most European BANs have less than 75 investor
members, with 10% of BANs having between 100 and
225 individual investors.
Business angel networks and syndicates appear to
offer a number of advantages for individual BAs.

BUSINESS ANGEL SYNDICATION AND RISK CAPITAL MARKET EVOLUTION

One advantage is overcoming the limitation on the
ﬁnancial capability of a solo BA (Kelly and Hay,
1996). Aernoudt (2005) found a median investment size
estimated between $5K and $250K for individual angels
and further suggested that such small individual investments and a trend of VC funds to only invest in larger
deals have combined to create a ‘second’ equity gap.
Other advantages include greater due diligence arising
from increased numbers of investors assessing prospective investment deals; reducing high search costs
for both BAs seeking investment opportunities and
entrepreneurs seeking investors; and greater deal ﬂow
generation and deeper pockets for follow-on funding
(Paul et al., 2007; Mason and Harrison, 2002).
Growth in the number of BANs and BASs is also
identiﬁed with various policy instruments designed to
improve the availability of risk capital at regional and
national levels (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Morrisette,
2007). The role of public policy in attempting to address
the equity gap for risk capital appears to be more widely
accepted in Europe than in North America. Gompers
and Lerner (2003) question whether government should
be encouraging people to become BAs in the USA.
Riding (2008) similarly identiﬁes concerns that it may
be counterproductive for Canadian public policy in
encouraging ‘amateur’ informal investors, although the
stimulation of value-adding BA investment is supported.
In the UK, government interventions have evolved
over time in an effort to increase the supply of equity
investment into early-stage companies. Initial efforts
focused on government VC funds that included the
creation of new institutions, such as the Industrial and
Commercial Finance Corporation (now 3i) (Mason
and Harrison, 1994; Murray, 2007; Mason, 2009).
Other initiatives followed, including the creation of
junior stock markets focused on technology companies,
such as the Unlisted Securities Market and AIM
(Pierrakis and Mason, 2008).
Table 1.

Tax-based incentives, such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) launched in 1994, have attempted
to increase the pool of UK informal investors. EIS1
provides a range of tax reliefs for investors who subscribe for qualifying shares in qualifying companies.
EIS makes it possible for an angel investor to have a
tax-efﬁcient diversiﬁed portfolio of unquoted investments without hands-on involvement. Although there
are ﬁve current separate EIS tax reliefs, it is perhaps
the relief for loss that is most generous to those investing in early-stage companies. An evaluation of the EIS
by Boyns et al. (2003) concluded that at least 50% of
funds would not have been invested by eligible EIS
investors in the absence of this scheme. Mason and
Harrison (2002) argue that stimulating the supply of
informal VC requires a richer cocktail of tax incentives than merely a reduction in capital gains tax,
including front-end tax relief and even VC guarantees.
Scotland provides an interesting case to consider
policy effects on risk capital markets. Table 1 shows
the number of deals, amount invested and average
deal sizes for European BAs by country (EBAN,
2008). It shows that Scotland had the second highest
average angel deal size (behind Finland) amongst the
10 nations/regions surveyed and higher than the UK
average (which excludes Scotland). In contrast to the
rest of the UK, where BANs have declined in number,
from a high of 52 in 2000 to 35 in 2008, Scotland has
seen a dramatic rise in the number of BAS, from three
in 2001 to 18 in 2007 (SE, 2008).
Table 1 also shows the signiﬁcant effect of government schemes to stimulate angel investment, particularly co-investment in Scotland and the rest of the UK.
Publicly supported co-investment funding is described
as that investment that occurs alongside private investors in response to a perceived equity gap for companies
seeking post-seed but pre-institutional investments,
between £500 000 and £2m (Hayton et al., 2008).

The prominence of BA activity in Scotland, identiﬁed in the EBAN survey, also suggests a shift in the
Scottish risk capital market from one characterised by
individual investors and largely informal and invisible
investment groups to one increasingly deﬁned by BA
syndicates. What is not clear is the nature and extent
of change in this market or how this change has come
about. It is also not clear what effect shifting risk capital
markets have on access to funding by entrepreneurs and
early-stage companies. In the next section, we present
the research methodology for the paper.

3. METHODOLOGY
With the focus of the paper on BAS and the evolution
of risk capital in a small market economy, we choose
Scotland as an appropriate study case and are guided
by three research questions:
RQ1
RQ2

RQ3

What are the demand and supply conditions that
have shaped the risk capital market in Scotland?
What are the key factors contributing to the
proliferation of BAS activity within the risk
capital market in Scotland?
What effects has this BAS activity had on the
risk capital market and on early-stage investment in Scotland?

Our ﬁrst research question draws upon secondary
data that include Scottish Enterprise reports and an independent assessment of LINC Scotland (EP Associates,
2009), comprising performance measures and stakeholder
interview data (interviews with 16 angel investors
(10 representing BAS)). For the second and third questions, we draw upon secondary data noted earlier and
primary data from semi-structured interviews with eight
key stakeholders from the Scottish risk capital market,
including directors of LINC Scotland, the Scottish
Co-investment Fund (SCF) and Scottish Enterprise.
We also draw upon data from a 2-year study of the
investment practices and outcomes of Scotland’s largest
BAS, which has over 100 investor members, over 30
active investments and a 16-year plus record of investment, to illuminate the way in which the BA market
has evolved over the past two decades. From this data,
we identify factors most prominent in the evolution of
the risk capital market and the proliferation of BAS
activity in Scotland (i.e. RQ2). The 2-year study
deployed a longitudinal case-based approach to examining the BAS using process evaluation guidelines
described as most appropriate for ongoing assessment

of perceptions of people, the context or ‘milieu’ where
they are found and the less understood external
factors affecting an organisation (e.g. Bulmar, 1986;
Silverman, 1993).
Participant observation was deployed to explore the
‘tacit’ component of knowledge that resides in people
at the BAS and relevant data sources external to the
syndicate (Vincenti 1990). All available investment
ﬁles (63) and relevant internal data sources were
examined. In some cases, investment data were missing
or incomplete, and thus data were obtained either from
an angel making the investment or from the management of the company in which the investment was made
via email or phone call. A ‘learning log’ of observations
and insights was deployed during the study focused on
capturing the investment management processes, which
were in practice but had not been codiﬁed or documented. Information on the investment processes was also
obtained through attendance to meetings of the investment group.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1. Demand Factors Inﬂuencing Scottish Risk
Capital Market
We begin by considering why early-stage investment
capital is of particular interest and concern for policy
makers in Scotland. Firstly, given the dominance of
large employers and a strong reliance on inward investment, Scotland has a weak track record in producing new business start-ups, which is well below the
UK average (Van Stel and Storey, 2004). Consequently, during the 1990s, public policy in Scotland
focused heavily on initiatives designed to promote
more new start-ups such as the ‘Business Birth Rate
Strategy’. Although Scottish Enterprise achieved
widespread acclaim for highlighting the importance
of the business birth rate, it was nevertheless seen as
a strategy that largely failed in terms of generating
more new business start-ups (Fraser of Allander Institute, 2001; Van Stel and Storey, 2004).
One consequence of this perceived failure was a
change in direction by policy makers in Scotland
during the early 2000s towards a focus on creating more
high-growth start-ups. Such a policy re-orientation was
based on a policy perception that ‘high technology
ﬁrms’ would be the primary generators of high
growth starts (Brown and Mason, 2012). The greater
risks associated with starting a high tech company
together with their greater orientation to wider external
Manage. Decis. Econ. 34: 95–107 (2013)
DOI: 10.1002/mde

<-----Page 4----->BUSINESS ANGEL SYNDICATION AND RISK CAPITAL MARKET EVOLUTION

markets mean that there is a higher probability of policy
having an impact by supporting these types of high risk
ﬁrms (Fraser of Allander Institute, 2001).
Secondly, Scotland performs poorly on most business research and development (BERD) indicators
and has been below the UK average for a number of
years, ranking 10th out of the 12 government regions
for business research and development (Turnbull and
Richmond, 2011) and is approximately one-third of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) average (1.6% of GDP; Scottish
Government, 2010). The composition of the Scottish
BERD is also highly concentrated, especially towards
the manufacturing sector, which accounts for almost
two-thirds of overall expenditure and the remainder in
just two product groups, pharmaceuticals (24%) and
precision instruments and optical products (14.5%)
(Turnbull and Richmond, 2011).
However, this weak innovation performance by
businesses in Scotland is not mirrored by the performance of Scottish Higher Education Research and Development (HERD), which is an indicator of research
funding attributed to Higher Educational Institutes
(HEIs). Scottish HEI outperforms the UK as a whole
in terms of its research income and knowledge outputs
(Roper et al., 2006), and Scotland’s expenditure on
HERD was the highest of all OECD members (Scottish
Government, 2010). One of the key strengths of
Scottish HEI is new company formation. For example,
Edinburgh University is ranked second in the UK for
companies formed (both spinouts and start-ups) that
have lasted more than 3 years and ﬁrst in the UK for
the total number of companies created in the period
2000–2010 (Scottish Government, 2011).
In comparing Scottish BERD with HERD, there is
evidence of ‘disconnection’ between what is generated
from a strong public science base and what is generated
and required from a weak corporate innovation base.
Further, there is an insigniﬁcant level of corporate
venturing (i.e. corporate investment) into early-stage
companies in Scotland (Roper et al., 2006).
Thirdly, a marked contraction of formal risk capital
occurred following the dot-com boom and subsequent
crash in 2000–2001. Don and Harrison (2006), in their
survey of private equity investments in Scotland
2000–2004, suggest that VC lost interest in the ‘new
deal’ market in Scotland. Thus, we identify a prevalence
of policies and practices focused on creating new
technology-based ﬁrms over the past two decades,
combined with contraction of VC from Scotland, which
appears to have led to demand for early-stage capital
outstripping supply of capital.

4.2. Supply Side Factors Inﬂuencing Scottish Risk
Capital Market
The conditions described earlier have led to public
policies designed to stimulate a larger pool of earlystage capital using BAs as the primary investment
vehicle. We identify two prominent supply side factors
that appear instrumental in shaping the Scottish risk
capital market and contributing to the growth of BA
investing in Scotland.
LINC Scotland. Signiﬁcant growth in Scottish BA
investment activity, shown earlier in Table 1, has been
largely attributed to the role played by LINC Scotland,
formed in 1993 as an independent, not-for-proﬁt introduction service to bring together private investors
(BAs) and Scottish start-up companies seeking equity
ﬁnance. LINC has been set up as a company limited
by guarantee and granted enterprise agency status by
the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is an exempt body
(under Statutory Instrument) and not an investment
advisor; thus, it is prohibited by law from advising businesses and investors on the merits of a particular
investment (EP Associates 2009).
The role of LINC was originally conceived within
the Scottish Enterprise Business Birth Rate Strategy2
(BBRS 1993), where the focus was on increasing the
number of nascent start-ups in Scotland. Thus, LINC’s
original objectives were as follows: (i) to increase the
number and total value of investments and (ii) to raise
the proﬁle of informal investment in Scotland (EP
Associates, 2009). More speciﬁcally, LINC actively
incubates new BAS, provides resources for angel
investors and offers workshops to educate those considering starting a BAS. Thus, LINC is strongly membership focused, and the liaison group, representing all
BAS members of LINC, meets regularly to discuss
matters of common interest.
Another role played by LINC is to enable companies seeking ﬁnance to obtain funding to cover the
cost of an agreed programme of deliverables that are
identiﬁed by the solutions provider—typically a potential investor—or by LINC Scotland itself (Mason and
Harrison, 2002). This is designed to remunerate the
investor’s time (usually a BA) plus any expert inputs
in the form of intellectual property (IP) protection,
legal costs or specialist external due diligence (e.g. on
technology) to solve speciﬁc problems. The maximum
grant is now £15 000 per company, which covers 70%
of total costs, with companies providing the balance.
Should an investment occur, the grant becomes
convertible to equity in the company for LINC on the
Manage. Decis. Econ. 34: 95–107 (2013)

same terms as the main external investor; LINC will
also exit at the same time as the other investors.
Scottish Co-investment Fund. Another supply side
factor contributing to the growth and proliferation of
BA syndication in Scotland is the government-backed
SCF. The angel community and LINC Scotland in
particular are identiﬁed as having a key role in the
creation of the SCF (Paul et al., 2007).
The SCF has added signiﬁcantly to the liquidity of
the BA investment community (Table 1) by providing
50% co-investment with an angel syndicate, requiring
the syndicate to lead the investment and undertake
necessary due diligence. Hayton et al. (2008), in their
evaluation of SCF, found that the SCF is providing angel groups with greater liquidity to make more investments and do more funding rounds, in a context where
the minimum size of investment by private VC funds
has increased.
In the co-investment process, the BAS is allowed to
take a lead on an investment deal, with no secondguessing on the deal by Scottish Enterprise as the
public partner. According to the LINC Director, the leveraging of new money through the SCF allows new
syndicates to get deals going and achieve a critical
mass of investments. The Director also suggests that
the impact of the SCF on already established angel
syndicates has not been so much on stimulating more
investment from them but rather has allowed them to
invest in more companies.
Don and Harrison (2006), in their survey of private
equity investments in Scotland, 2000–2004, found that
BA deal size varied considerably on the basis of coinvestments. Without co-investment, the average deal
size was £179K. With co-investment, the average deal
size was £475K. They found that the average deal size
rose to £901K when co-investing with an institutional
investor and further identiﬁed that approximately 70%
of deals involving both angels and institutional funds
were follow-on deals. The impact of the SCF and issue
of larger investment deals will be examined further in
the paper.
4.3. Evolution of Risk Capital Market:
Proliferation of BAS
Our ﬁndings identify three key factors contributing to
the proliferation of BAS activity. First, the role of
LINC Scotland has evolved from a network builder,
which matched those seeking and those providing
informal investment (e.g. stimulating more informal
risk capital to supply early-stage Scottish companies),
to a market catalyst that develops new BAS. This
Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

changing role has been most pronounced over the past
10 years, where the number of identiﬁable BAS has
grown from 3 to 18, the most radical shift in risk
capital market organisation of any region in Europe.
An emphasis on syndication (i.e. pooling investors
together) versus networks (i.e. increasing the number
of individual angels) further distinguishes the Scottish
risk capital market from the market in mainland
Europe.
One advantage of LINC, according to its Director,
is that LINC, in contrast to initiatives in England,
was created as an independent body outside of government and has become widely accepted as a ‘useful
intermediary’ that attempts to protect its angel syndicate
members as much as possible from government bureaucracy. Ramsden et al. (2007) identify that the 83 Training Enterprise Councils (TEC) formed in England in
1990 and responsible for regional economic development all attempted to develop separate angel networks.
Most of these failed because of lack of critical mass of
investors. Although England consolidated the TEC
into a new structure comprising 10–12 larger regional
development agencies in 2001, the focus was on development of BANs (i.e. more individual angels) instead of
BAS as was the case in Scotland.
LINC is also not focused on sustaining itself as a support agency, contrary to many support initiatives of the
public sector, where protectionism and efforts to ensure
sustainability are common themes. The LINC Director
states: ‘there is probably no way that LINC itself will
be permanently sustainable, but if LINC can leave
behind, say 15 angel groups which continue in a sustainable manner, that’s a signiﬁcant improvement to the
infrastructure of the market that wasn’t there before’.
The focus on creating more BAS over the past
decade has resulted in more deal ﬂow by volume and
value and an increase in the number of new players
qualiﬁed to become co-investment partners for SCF.
During the period 2004–2007, LINC Scotland was
credited with supporting approximately £28m to aid
Scottish start-up and early-growth companies. Deal
volume increased from 38 in 2004/2005 to 56 in
2006/2007, which accounted for £10.8m of investment (EP Associates, 2009). By 2009/2010, Scottish
BAS invested £18.2m in 78 businesses and raised a
total of £27.5m when including SCF investment
(Mason and Harrison, 2011).
We suggest that a second factor contributing to
BAS growth is the presence of particular sociocultural
characteristics favouring angel investing. We identify
four prominent, recurring themes highlighted by
BAS stakeholders: (i) entrepreneurial activity is in
Manage. Decis. Econ. 34: 95–107 (2013)
DOI: 10.1002/mde

<-----Page 6----->BUSINESS ANGEL SYNDICATION AND RISK CAPITAL MARKET EVOLUTION

close proximity to most BAs (i.e. three urban areas:
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee); (ii) presence of a
distinct Scottish identity that facilitates a focus for
investing in Scottish entrepreneurs; (iii) Scotland has
a large number of wealthy individuals; and (iv) availability of public co-investing (SCF) and generous tax
relief (EIS) for wealthy individuals. The LINC Director identiﬁes the advantage of Scotland’s ‘smallness’
and a densely networked investment community that
does not require LINC to advertise or promote itself
to ﬁnd new angels.
One of the interesting observations is a distinctive
‘inclusive’ emphasis on deﬁnitions of BAs generated
by the LINC leadership that we suggest have contributed to LINC’s success. For example, the LINC
Director deﬁnes a BA as ‘a private individual investing
their own money into companies in which they can
make a difference—an active and direct investment
rather than passive’. He further deﬁnes a BAS as ‘a
structured group of BAs with deﬁned members. Some
members come together to co-invest in a particular deal,
with all having access to investment opportunities
sourced through the syndicate’.
Similarly, the Chairman of LINC deﬁnes a BAS as
‘a group of people who get together and share both the
involvement in looking at company potential and also
their own experiences—to allow them to widen the
scope on what they are prepared to invest in as well as
to do more investments’. The Chairman further suggests
that LINC does not force the creation of a BAS.
A third factor is the growth and success of two
original BAS that have inﬂuenced the subsequent
development of more recent syndicates in Scotland;
Archangel, created in 1993 followed by Braveheart
in 1997. Over the following 13 years, an additional
16 BAS were created. In the evolution of the Scottish
risk capital market, various BAS models have
emerged, inﬂuenced by advice from LINC Scotland.
However, Archangel and Braveheart remain the two
dominant models in Scotland.
Braveheart began as a BAS, receiving support
from LINC to professionalise its investment management operations and has evolved to act more like
a small VC ﬁrm, but still possessing an angel arm.
The LINC Chairman suggests that ‘this is the ﬁrst
example of a bottom-up creation of a VC’. He adds
that VC is usually formed by taking large chunks
of institutional money as funds and employing professional fund managers to oversee the investment
of such funds, with VC tending to be fee driven
and looking for returns on arrangement fees and due
diligence fees.

In the case of Braveheart, the decision to take a fund
approach rather than an individual investor approach
was ratiﬁed by its directors to sit alongside individual
investments. The presence of a fund and what it represents, according to the LINC Chairman, drives a high
expectation of a time-sensitive return, which in turn
drives the investment criteria and investment management. These elements contrast with a generally recognised more patient, involved and less aggressive
investment management approach from BAs.
The Archangel model, consisting of a tight core of
primary, lead investors who know each other, is seen
as an important ingredient for new syndicates in
Scotland, according to the LINC Director. This lead
investor group provides a central decision-making
function that works well when the BAS has a larger
number of passive investors who do not have the time
to come to investment presentations. The reliance on
others’ judgement for investment will not suit all
investors. Archangel will be discussed in more detail
in the next section.
Other models have emerged alongside Archangel
and Braveheart. For example, the Tri-Cap model in
the Scottish borders operates more like a ‘dinner club’,
where all members are provided with the investment
opportunity and the investment develops from there.
Par Equity, a more recent BAS, is focused primarily
on information and communications technology (ICT);
therefore, some BAS are sector speciﬁc and develop
their investment expertise around a narrower set of
investment opportunities.
We ﬁnd evidence of the natural evolution of more
mature BAS, following the Archangel and Braveheart
models, to ‘professionalise’ their gatekeepers and the
critical role that these gatekeepers play in the earlystage and small and medium enterprise community in
Scotland. As a BAS builds its portfolio, portfolio
management becomes critical and time consuming
for gatekeepers, potentially compromising the ability
to take on new investments.
We identify the importance of the high level of
publicity undertaken by Archangel, and to a lesser
extent Braveheart, to publicise what they were doing,
which appears to have positively inﬂuenced more
BAS activity in Scotland. This publicity includes
promoting their support for early-stage Scottish
companies as well as providing support for others
attempting to set up new BAS. The LINC Chairman
suggests that ‘this has assisted in the promotion in
Scotland of early-stage private equity investment
as an asset class of its own, in which high-net-worth
individuals should have a share’.

4.4. Effects of Business Angel Syndicates Activity
on Early-Stage Market: Archangel Case
We now consider the effects of a shift in the Scottish
risk capital market towards more BAS activity by examining Scotland’s largest and most inﬂuential BAS. Our
ﬁndings suggest that Archangel has been instrumental
as a role model stimulating BAS development in
Scotland, despite the atypical and unstructured origins
of Archangel. We describe Archangel as an ‘atypical’
BAS given the proﬁle of syndicate co-founders, which
do not match any of the three angel types (entrepreneur,
income seeking and wealth maximising) suggested by
Coveney and Moore (1998). We suggest that the cofounders represent another type of angel that we term
‘experimental’ angels, which we describe as ‘not yet
committed, potential angel investors who pool their
money and business experiences to seek local, highreturn investments and who transform into committed
angel investors based on their investment experiences
and investment returns’.
Archangel was created without LINC support but has
received subsidies from LINC to professionalise their
operations and went through a stage of non-affordability,
similar to many subsequent BAS receiving LINC support. As Archangel draws upon approximately £2m
from the SCF annually, a 2.5% deal fee becomes a
signiﬁcant contribution to their overheads, in addition
to monitoring fees from their portfolio.
The ‘demonstrator effect’ for LINC in using
Archangel as a BAS model has been and continues
to be important, particularly the ‘two-ring model’ that
has been comprehensively adopted by other Scottish
BAS. The ﬁrst ring includes the syndicate’s board of
ﬁve core (or inner circle) members; two of whom are
the original founders, who lead all syndicate investments. The core and gate-keepers (i.e. executives) share
the responsibility of building relationships with investors and policy makers and of developing networks
with the wider business community to ensure outreach.
The second ring includes approximately 120 investors
registered with the syndicate, who represent a diverse
group of local business leaders and entrepreneurs with
experience in funding and building successful companies and some high-net-worth individuals.
In Scotland, the supply of people that LINC would
regard as classic, hands-on, skilled BAs is very small;
therefore, LINC needs to take small groups of them at
the node, around which can be clustered a much bigger
outer ring of ‘semi-passive investors.’ The core group
provides the leadership that this other more passive
money follows. We suggest that this two-ring model is

appropriate as long as there is an imbalance between a
larger number of wealthy people and true angels.
The Archangel model can also facilitate old money
into new sectors, as long as people with requisite
experiences and expertise can be drawn in. Areas such
as renewables and bioscience are examples. There is a
much larger population of ‘generalist business angels’
who will follow, but the key nodes are critical. One of
the Archangel co-founders understands how Archangel
has inspired others to create their own BAS. He also
suggests that we are not precious about [Archangel];
we openly supports others attempting to create or
manage their own BAS’.
Investment performance. In examining BAS aggregate investment performance to consider investment
ﬂow to entrepreneurs, returns to investors, investment
trends, deal characteristics and syndicate growth, we
ﬁnd that over 16 years (1992–2008), Archangel has
made 63 investments, with eight exits, three dividendpaying investments, 25 failures, four moribund and 23
active companies (Table 2). The syndicate provides
equity in seed and early-stage deals that range from
£300K to £1m. We ﬁnd that, with few exceptions,
syndicate investments have been made into early stage
companies (pre-revenue and pre-sales) without formalised structures or management. A total of £50.7m has
been invested by the syndicate in total, made up of
£23.4m in active companies and £20m in exited companies (ﬂoats, trade sales and dividends), with £7.3m loss
in failed/moribund companies.
Average investment has been £615K, involving an
average of 22 investors and four rounds of funding.
The majority of ventures have been product based
(69%) rather than service based (31%), with 39%
from the information technology (IT) sector, 27%
from life science, 16% from high tech and the remainder representing other sectors. However, we ﬁnd that
by amount invested, life science is larger than IT
(35% vs. 31%). Syndicate investment performance
identiﬁes 18% exits (£20m), 45% losses (£7.3m) and
18% active (£20m) in the portfolio. A total of 11
spin-outs from universities and the National Health
Service have been supported to date, representing
17% of investments.
We ﬁnd strong evidence of the effect of public programmes to stimulate syndicate investment activity,
with 27 investment deals (43% of total) involving
the SCF. In ﬁnding a strong leveraging effect of syndicate investment, with an additional £35m raised from
co-investors, we see that 17% of total investment has
involved VC. We suggest a signiﬁcant local economic

development role played by the syndicate, with over
800 new jobs generated through the 63 investments.
Table 3 summarises syndicate exit performance
(1992–2008), which includes successful trade sales
(3), initial public offering (3) and dividend-paying
investments (3). Syndicate performance is almost 1:1
for active/exited (initial public offering (IPO) and trade
sale)/dividend paying companies (55%) versus failed/
moribund companies (45%). We observe, not surprisingly, a wide range in internal rate of return from 2%
(dividend-paying) to 356% from an IPO in 2001.
Table 3 also identiﬁes a spread of investment
returns over the period 1998–2007, which we suggest
contributes to the perception, both within the BAS and
external to it, of an active and successful investment
process, which allowed the BAS to attract new investors over this period.
Figure 1 shows syndicate growth, represented by
the number of new investments, failures, exits and
portfolio size for the period 1992–2009. Figure 1

shows a steady and gradual increase in the number
of investments over 16 years, with the exception of
two periods: (i) 1998–1999, when the syndicate experienced two trade sales, which took up much of the
founders’ time and limited further investment, and
(ii) 1999–2000, when seven new investments were
made, with ﬁve failures. Figure 1 also shows an
upward trend to failures beginning in 2001 (when the
investment portfolio reached 26).
In examining how investment performance may
affect BAS development, we identify six distinctive
phases of syndicate development over 16 years that we
describe as follows: organic development (1992–1997),
early harvest (1998–1999), operational systemisation
(2000–2001), ﬁrst consolidation (2002–2004), late harvest (2005–2006) and second consolidation (2007–).
We also identify three broader stages of investment
management: informal partnership, informal club of
investors and professional syndicate. Whether other
BAS display similar phases of syndicate development

or whether a deﬁnitive progression towards more
professional investment management over time can be
observed amongst a comparative sample of older BAS
is a suggested topic for future research.
We acknowledge the critical effect of market
conditions on syndicate development (e.g. strong US
IT market during the early harvest phase and
dot.com and genomics bubbles affecting operational
and ﬁrst consolidation phases). However, our evidence
suggests that investment management activity, not
simply investment performance, affects syndicate
development. We ﬁnd that during the ‘organic phase’,
for example, the drive to recruit new investors was
not driven by a need to expand membership in order
to increase the size of investment deals but was rather
in response to an increasing number of smaller investment opportunities developing as the syndicate’s reputation grew and attracted more interest from local
entrepreneurs.
As suggested earlier, syndicate growth has also
been positively inﬂuenced by policy interventions.

related to expansion of investor management operations. We also identify the positive impact of the UK
Financial Services and Management Act (FSMA)
2000, providing legal guidelines on doing business
with others who are qualiﬁed as high-net-worth individuals or as sophisticated investors. The FSMA 2000
allowed BAS the freedom to bring on more investors
and to discuss investment in a more open manner
than previously.
One further question in examining Archangel investment data is how BAS performance might be affecting
the Scottish risk capital market. Table 4 shows a 6-year
decline since 2004 in the number of investments into
new companies (four in 2005, three in 2006 and in
2007, one in 2008 and none in 2009) compared with
the average of 3.7 investments per year over a 16-year
period (1992–2008).
While acknowledging the effects of market conditions on investment outcomes, ﬁndings suggest that
the number of new investment deals being done by
larger, successful BAS is likely to decrease. We suggest a number of inter-related causal factors constraining new deal investment. At the pre-investment stage,

syndicate growth, along with a higher proﬁle and
reputation for successful investment, has generated a
larger number of disclosed opportunities but has
resulted in a higher level of selectivity. This contrasts
to the early 1990s, when the Archangel co-founders
scrutinised a small number of deals and invested in
a higher proportion of the deals. With this came a
larger number of failures and also some spectacular
successes.
At the investment stage, syndicate growth, as measured by new investors, has increased investment
capacity and the ability of the syndicate to invest in
larger deals but has generated greater demand for
follow-on funding as the portfolio has grown, with
less funding available for new deals. Of 12 investments over £1m in the Archangel portfolio in 2008,
which represent £20.1m of syndicate investment,
approximately 71% (£14) was invested in companies
that were 5 years or older. Although this is hardly surprising for a portfolio increasingly biased towards life
sciences, we observe a trend towards a greater number
of investment rounds per company (ﬁve in 2008
versus 16-year average of four), suggesting the ‘longer
time to exit’ nature of life sciences investment.
At the post-investment stage, we identify a ‘lighton-the-reins’ approach to company monitoring and
acknowledge the ‘patient investor’ and portfolio effect
philosophy characterising BA investment management. However, we identify two limitations to this
approach. One is the problem of providing follow-on
funding when the company has either diverted from
originally agreed plans or not met agreed milestones.
Another problem may relate to the challenge of managing a growing portfolio (biased towards life sciences)
in the absence of time-constrained investment (as with
VC funds).
In summary, evidence suggests that large, successful BAS may reduce their number of new investment
deals due to: increased new deal selectivity, higher
demand for follow-on funding, longer follow-on
investment horizons and limited pressures to exit (or
to force an exit from company directors).

5. CONCLUSION
This paper examined the evolution of risk capital
markets in a small market economy (Scotland), with
particular reference to business angel syndicates
(BAS). We describe risk capital market evolution in
terms of a shift from a market characterised by individual investors and largely informal and invisible
investment groups to a market increasingly deﬁned
by recognised BAS. The extent of this market evolution is seen in a sixfold growth in the number of
identiﬁable BAS (3–18) over the past decade, the most
radical shift in the early stage risk capital market of
any region in Europe.
The paper offers a number of important policy
implications. We identify three demand factors that
have justiﬁed policy intervention into the risk
capital market: a prevalence of policies and practices
focused on creating new technology-based ﬁrms;
unbalanced Scottish BERD and HERD and a resultant
‘disconnect’ between public and private sector
technology supply and demand; and the absence of a
critical mass of high-value investments to attract and
sustain VC.
We suggest that a narrow range of focused but
integrated public policies (e.g. LINC Scotland and
SCF) can be very effective in informal investment
capacity building at both the individual angel and
syndicate levels and, as a result, are recipients of wide
recognition and praise from the private sector and
other regions. Our ﬁndings further suggest that tax
incentives (e.g. EIS) play a critical role in ‘incentivising’ high-net-worth individuals to become BAs and
providing a steady supply of angels that makes new
BAS formation and growth possible. Such ﬁndings
counter a large body of literature on the ineffectiveness
of enterprise policy interventions.
However, our paper suggests that policies to
stimulate the supply of risk capital will be moderated
by the particular sociocultural context in which they
are deployed. In our study, we identify a number
of regional characteristics favouring BA activity,
Manage. Decis. Econ. 34: 95–107 (2013)
DOI: 10.1002/mde

<-----Page 11----->106

G. GREGSON ET AL.

including a strong ‘inclusiveness’ philosophy guiding
the development of the BAS market. This particular
context has contributed to policy success but,
importantly, has created a distinctly Scottish BA
community that appears cohesive, well respected
by public and private stakeholders and envied by
other regions.
A further policy implication from the paper is that
larger, successful BAS are likely to reduce their
number of new investment deals and to avoid smaller
deals, potentially contributing to an equity gap at the
low end of investment. Scotland’s largest BAS, for
example, is no longer the dominant player in new deal
investment in Scotland. In terms of the funding escalator model, although larger BAS appear to have shifted
‘up the escalator’ to ﬁll a gap left by the contraction of
VC, the migration of solo angels to syndicates and the
need to support bigger deals with follow-on investment may be leaving a gap further down the escalator.
We suggest the need, therefore, for policy makers or
BAS ‘catalysts’, such as LINC Scotland, to encourage
the formation of new BAS whose early lifecycles are
likely to parallel that of the BAS at the centre of this
study, namely sourcing from a small number of deals,
investing in a higher proportion of the deals assessed
and taking on entrepreneurial ventures seeking smaller
investments.
The paper offers some theoretical implications for
BAS. While acknowledging the limitation of generalising from our small sample, we suggest a number of
factors contributing to BAS longevity and success:
the need for regular exits, recycling of proﬁts, patient
investor base, competent professional management
and solid, reputable market brand. We suggest that a
small number of large investment returns can establish
a strong reputation as an entrepreneurial ﬁnancier in
a local economy, despite the fact that returns from
long-term investment are negatively skewed.
In suggesting that larger, successful BAS reduce
their numbers of new investment deals and avoid
smaller deals, we suggest that this is more likely with
a portfolio biassed towards life sciences—that will
require more follow-on funding, more investment
rounds and longer times to exit than other investments
in sectors such as IT. We also postulate that a ‘patient
investor’ and ‘light-on-the-reins’ approach to postinvestment management (e.g. differentiating angels
from VC) and the absence of time-constrained funds
(as with VC) may also reduce pressures to exit, affecting the capacity of the BAS to take on new investment
deals. Does this suggest the need for greater postinvestment management capabilities within BAS,

particularly in more complex sectors such as life
sciences, to determine strategies and routes to exit?
Future research is suggested to determine an aggregate measure of impact from BAS activity on the
Scottish economy. Anecdotal evidence and limited
analysis to date suggest that there have been few
successful exits and few recent exits by IPO, despite
a reasonable number of investments by Scotland’s 18
BAS. We acknowledge the potentially negative effects
of the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis and recession in
the UK affecting new investments as well as exits.
However, an important research question for further
study is whether there are limits to (enforced) reliance
on angel investors in stimulating entrepreneur-led
economic development.
