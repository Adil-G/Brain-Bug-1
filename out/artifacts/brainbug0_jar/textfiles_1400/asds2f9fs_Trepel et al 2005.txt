Abstract
Most decisions must be made without advance knowledge of their consequences. Economists and psychologists have devoted much
attention to modeling decisions made under conditions of risk in which options can be characterized by a known probability distribution over
possible outcomes. The descriptive shortcomings of classical economic models motivated the development of prospect theory (D. Kahneman,
A. Tversky, Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 4 (1979) 263–291; A. Tversky, D. Kahneman, Advances in
prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 5 (4) (1992) 297–323) the most successful
behavioral model of decision under risk. In the prospect theory, subjective value is modeled by a value function that is concave for gains,
convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains; the impact of probabilities are characterized by a weighting function that overweights
low probabilities and underweights moderate to high probabilities. We outline the possible neural bases of the components of prospect theory,
surveying evidence from human imaging, lesion, and neuropharmacology studies as well as animal neurophysiology studies. These results
provide preliminary suggestions concerning the neural bases of prospect theory that include a broad set of brain regions and neuromodulatory
systems. These data suggest that focused studies of decision making in the context of quantitative models may provide substantial leverage
towards a fuller understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of decision making.

1. Introduction
Most decisions entail some degree of risk. Should one
purchase an extended warranty on a new car or take one’s
chances? Dash through the middle of a busy street or take
the long way via a crosswalk? Opt for surgery or radiation
therapy for a tumor? Invest retirement savings in the stock
market or treasury bills? From mundane dilemmas to lifedefining decisions, we are usually forced to choose without
knowing in advance what the consequences will be.

The study of decision making under risk has been a major
thrust of microeconomics for most of the last century;
however, it has only received significant attention from
psychologists in the last few decades. Early behavioral
studies provided simple cognitive accounts of preferences
between chance gambles, with more recent studies exploring
the role of affect, motivation, and social context in such
decisions. The newest, and possibly most exciting, frontier in
this research area is the effort to understand the ways in
which neural processes mediate risk-taking behavior. The
last few years have seen a tremendous push by neuroscientists and their collaborators to apply modern neurophysiology methods (e.g., ERP, fMRI, and animal models) to
economic decisions. The purpose of this paper is to take

<-----Page 1----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

stock of some of these early efforts and relate them to more
traditional behavioral research on decision making under
risk.
The lay concept of briskQ is associated with hazards that
fill one with dread and/or are poorly understood [112]. In a
financial context, people tend to think of risk as increasing
with the magnitude and probability of potential losses [79].
Decision theorists, in contrast, view risk as increasing with
the variance in the probability distribution of possible
outcomes. Thus, a bet that offers $100 if a fair coin lands
heads and nothing if it lands tails is more briskyQ than an
option that offers $60 if a fair coin lands heads and $40 if it
lands tails. Economists following Knight [68] distinguish
risk from uncertainty. Decisions under risk entail options
that have well-specified or transparent outcome probabilities, such as a bet on a coin toss or a lottery with a known
number of tickets. Decisions under uncertainty, by contrast,
entail options whose outcomes depend on natural events
such as a victory by the home team or a rise in interest rates,
so that probabilities must be estimated by the decision
maker with some degree of vagueness or imprecision. In the
present paper, we focus our attention primarily on decisions
under risk for the following practical reasons: (1) Risk is a
simpler domain that is better understood and more
thoroughly characterized by behavioral decision theorists,
(2) most extant work in cognitive neuroscience at this early
juncture speaks more directly to decisions under risk than to
decisions under uncertainty.
The following section of this paper provides a brief
historical overview of traditional models of decision making
under risk, culminating in prospect theory [61,123], the
most influential descriptive account that has emerged to
date. Next, we distill the most important facets of prospect
theory and map them onto relevant neuroscience studies. In
particular, we draw on basic neurophysiology, computational modeling, and clinical neuroimaging to advance a
novel framework that describes several candidate mechanisms underlying risky choice behaviors. Finally, we
conclude by suggesting promising avenues for future
research. Naturally, at this early juncture, our conclusions
are preliminary and highly speculative.

2. The Classical theory of decision under risk
The primitives in most traditional models of decision
under risk and uncertainty are acts, states, and consequences. An act is an action that is associated with a set of
possible consequences that depend on which one of a set of
possible states of the world obtains. To illustrate, consider a
gambler who considers betting a dollar on a single spin of a
roulette wheel (see Table 1). The gambler considers two
possible acts: Bet on bredQ or bet on bblack.Q The
consequence of this decision depends on which state of
the world will occur after the roulette wheel is spun: The
ball will land in one of the 18 red numbers, one of the 18

black numbers, or one of the two green numbers (0 or 00).
Our roulette gambler faces a decision under risk because
the objective probabilities of each relevant state of the
world are transparent. If she were instead considering a bet
on either the home team or visiting team winning an
upcoming basketball game, our hypothetical gambler would
be facing a decision under uncertainty because she would
be forced to assess the probability that each team wins with
some degree of subjectivity and vagueness.
The origin of decision theory is usually traced back to a
17th century correspondence between Pascal and Fermat that
laid the mathematical foundation for probability theory.
Following this work, theorists asserted that decision makers
ought to choose the option that offers the highest expected
value (EV).
EV ¼ x1 p1 þ x2 p2 þ N þ xn pn

where x i is the (monetary) outcome of state i and p i is the
probability of state i.
A decision maker is said to be brisk neutralQ if she is
indifferent between a gamble and its expected value; she is
said to be brisk averseQ if she prefers a sure payment to a
risky prospect of equal or higher expected value; she is said
to be brisk-seekingQ if she prefers a risky prospect to a sure
payment of equal or higher expected value. Thus, expected
value maximization assumes a neutral attitude toward risk.
For instance, a decision maker who employs this rule will
prefer to receive $100 if a fair coin lands heads (and nothing
otherwise) to a sure payment of $49, because the expected
value of the gamble ($50 = .5  $100) is higher than the
value of the sure thing ($49). Expected value maximization
is problematic because it does not allow decision makers to
exhibit risk aversion—it cannot explain, for example, why
people would prefer a sure $49 over a .5 probability of $100
or why they would purchase insurance. Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli [17] advanced a solution to this
problem when he asserted that people do not evaluate
options by their objective value but rather by their utility or
bmoral value.Q Bernoulli observed that a particular amount
of money (say, 100 ducats) is valued more when a person is
poor than when she is wealthy and, therefore, marginal
utility decreases as wealth increases. This gives rise to a

<-----Page 2----->36

C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

utility function that is concave over states of wealth (see
Fig. 1). In Bernoulli’s model, decision makers choose the
option with highest expected utility (EU):
EU ¼

n
X

uðxi Þpi

ð2Þ

i¼1

where u(x i ) represents the utility of obtaining outcome x i .
For example, a concave utility function implies that the
utility gained by receiving $50 is more than half the utility
gained by receiving $100 and, therefore, a decision maker
with such a utility function should prefer $50 for sure to a .5
probability of receiving $100.
Expected utility gained greater currency in economic
theorizing when von Neumann and Morgenstern [124]
articulated a set of axioms that are necessary and sufficient
to allow one to represent preferences by expected utility
maximization. The axioms were relatively simple and on
their surface seemed unassailable. For instance, one
prominent formulation of expected utility theory [107]
relies on an axiom known as the bsure-thing principleQ: If
two acts yield the same consequence when a particular state
obtains, then a person’s preferences among those acts
should not depend on the particular consequence (i.e., the
bsure thingQ) that they have in common. To illustrate,
consider a game in which a coin is flipped to determine
which fruit will be included in your lunch. Suppose that you
would rather receive an apple if a fair coin lands heads and
a cantaloupe if it lands tails (a, H; c, T) than receive a
banana if the coin lands heads and a cantaloupe if it lands
tails (b, H; c, T). If this is the case, you should also prefer to
receive an apple if the coin lands heads and dates if the coin
lands tails (a, H; d, T) to a banana if it lands heads and
dates if it lands tails (b, H; d, T).
The sure-thing principle is necessary to establish that
utilities of outcomes are weighted by their respective
probabilities. However, it was not long before the descriptive
validity of expected utility theory and its axioms were called
into question. The most powerful challenge has come to be

known as the bAllais ParadoxQ [4,5]. Consider the following
choices:
Decision 1. Choose between (A) $1 million for sure and;
(B) a 10% chance of receiving $5 million, an 89% chance
of receiving $1 million, and a 1% chance of receiving
nothing.
Decision 2. Choose between (C) an 11% chance of receiving
$1 million and; (D) a 10% chance of receiving $5 million.
Most people choose (A) over (B) in the first decision
and (D) over (C) in the second decision, which violates the
sure-thing principle. To see why, consider options (A)
through (D) as being payment schemes attached to different
lottery tickets that are numbered consecutively from 1 to
100 (see Table 2). Note that one can transform options (A)
and (B) into options (C) and (D), respectively, merely by
replacing the common consequence (receive $1 M if the
ticket drawn is 12–100) with a new common consequence
(receive $0 if the ticket drawn is 12–100). Thus, according
to the sure-thing principle, a person should favor option (C)
over option (D) if and only if he or she prefers option (A) to
option (B), and the dominant pattern of preferences violates
this axiom. Typically, people explain their choice in
decision (1) as a preference for certainty over a possibility
of receiving nothing; meanwhile, they explain their choice
in decision (2) as a preference for a higher possible prize
given that the difference between a probability of .10 and
.11 is not very large.
The Allais Paradox is perhaps the starkest and most
celebrated violation of expected utility theory. In the years
since it was articulated, numerous studies of decision
under risk have shown that people often violate the
principle of risk aversion that underlies much economic
analysis. Table 3 illustrates a common pattern of risk
aversion and risk seeking exhibited by participants in
studies of Tversky and Kahneman [123]. Let C(x, p) be
the certainty equivalent of the prospect (x, p) that offers to
pay $x with probability p (i.e., the sure payment that is
deemed equally attractive to the risky prospect). The upper
left-hand entry in the table shows that the median
participant was indifferent between receiving $14 for sure
and a 5% chance of receiving $100. Because the expected
value of the prospect is only $5, this observation reflects
risk-seeking behavior.
Table 3a reveals a fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: Risk
seeking for low-probability gains and high-probability

losses, coupled with risk aversion for high-probability
gains and low-probability losses. Choices consistent with
this fourfold pattern have been observed in several
studies [41,52,61,92]. Risk seeking for low-probability
gains may contribute to the attraction of gambling,
whereas risk aversion for low-probability losses may
contribute to the attraction of insurance. Risk aversion for
high-probability gains may contribute to the preference
for certainty, as in the Allais [4] paradox, whereas risk
seeking for high-probability losses is consistent with the
common tendency to undertake risk to avoid facing a
sure loss.

3. Prospect theory
The Allais Paradox and fourfold pattern of risk attitudes
are accommodated neatly by prospect theory [61,123], the
leading behavioral model of decision making under risk,
and the major work for which psychologist Daniel Kahneman was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics.
According to prospect theory, the value V of a simple
prospect that pays $x with probability p (and nothing
otherwise) is given by
V ð x; pÞ ¼ vð xÞwð pÞ;

ð3Þ

where v measures the subjective value of the consequence
x, and w measures the impact of probability p on the

37

attractiveness of the prospect (see Fig. 2).1 Prospect theory
differs from expected utility theory in a number of ways.
First, the utility function u(.) over states of wealth is
replaced with a value function v(.) over gains and losses
relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), with
v(0) = 0. Second, this subjective value function is not
weighted by outcome probabilities but rather by a decision
weight, w, that represents the impact of the relevant
probability on the valuation of the prospect. Decision
weights are normalized so that w(0) = 0 and w(1) = 1. Note
that w is not interpreted as a measure of degree of belief—a
person may believe that the probability of a fair coin
landing heads is one-half but afford this event a weight of
less than one-half in the evaluation of a prospect. Third,
unlike expected utility theory, prospect theory explicitly
incorporates principles of framing and editing that allow for
different descriptions of the same choice to give rise to
different decisions.
3.1. Characterizing the value and weighting functions
According to prospect theory, the shapes of the value
function v(.) and weighting function w(.) reflect the
psychophysics of diminishing sensitivity. That is, the
marginal impact of a change in outcome or probability
diminishes with distance from relevant reference points.
For monetary outcomes, the status quo generally serves as
the reference point distinguishing losses from gains, so that
the function is concave for gains and convex for losses
(see Fig. 2A). Concavity for gains contributes to risk
aversion for gains as with the standard utility function
(Fig. 1). Convexity for losses, on the other hand,
contributes to risk seeking for losses. For instance, the
disvalue of losing $50 is more than half the disvalue of
losing $100, which will contribute to a preference for the
gamble (lose $100 with probability .5) over the sure loss
(lose $50 for sure).
The prospect theory value function is also steeper for
losses than gains, a property known as loss aversion.
People typically require more compensation to give up a
possession than they would have been willing to pay to
obtain it in the first place (e.g., [65]) and the tendency for
the relative disadvantages of alternatives to loom larger
than the relative advantages supports a bias toward the
status quo (e.g., [106]). In the context of decision under
risk, loss aversion gives rise to risk aversion for mixed
(gain–loss) gambles so that, for example, people typically
reject a gamble that offers a .5 chance of gaining $100 and
a .5 chance of losing $100 (see Table 3b).
1
There are a number of subtle differences between the original
formulation of prospect theory advanced in Kahneman and Tversky [61]
and the cumulative version advanced in Tversky and Kahneman [123]. In
the present paper, we will confine most of our discussion to choices among
risky prospects that offer a single positive and/or negative outcome, for
which these formulations coincide.

Fig. 2. Value and weighting functions from prospect theory. (A) Value
function v as a function of gains and losses. (B) Weighting function w for
gains as a function of the probability p of a chance event.

Following Kahneman and Tversky [63], we can parameterize the value function as a power function2:

xz0
xa
ð4Þ
vð xÞ ¼
 kð  x Þ b x b 0
where a, b N 0 measure the curvature of the value function
for gains and losses, respectively, and k is the coefficient of
loss aversion. Thus, the value function for gains (losses) is
increasingly concave (convex) for smaller values of a(b) b
1, and loss aversion is more pronounced for larger values of
k N 1. Tversky and Kahneman [123] estimated median
values of a = .88, b = .88, and k = 2.25 among their sample
of college students.
For probability, there are two natural reference points:
Impossibility and certainty. Hence, diminishing sensitivity
implies an inverse-S-shaped weighting function that is
concave near zero and convex near one, as depicted in
Fig. 2B. It explains the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes
(Table 3a), because low probabilities are overweighted
(leading to risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for
losses) and high probabilities are underweighted (leading to
risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses). It also
explains the Allais Paradox because the weighting function
is steeper between .99 and 1 than it is between .10 and .11
(so that the difference between a 0.99 chance of a prize and
a certainty of a prize in Decision 1 looms larger than the
difference between a .10 and .11 chance of a prize in
Decision 2). This inverse-S-shaped weighting function
seems to be consistent with a range of empirical findings
(see [1,23,49,96,126,128,129]).
Following Lattimore et al. [74], the weighting function can
be parameterized in the following form (which assumes that
the relation between w and p is linear in a log-odds metric):
w ð pÞ ¼

dpc

dpc
þ ð 1  pÞ c

ð5Þ

where d N 0 measures the elevation of the weighting
function and c N 0 measures its degree of curvature. The

The power function implies constant relative risk aversion—as the
stakes of a prospect (x,p) are multiplied by a constant k then so is the
certainty equivalent of that prospect, C(x,p) so that C(kx,p) = kC(x,p).

weighting function is more elevated (exhibiting less overall
risk aversion for gains, more overall risk aversion for losses)
as d increases and more curved (exhibiting more rapidly
diminishing sensitivity to probabilities around the boundaries of 0 and 1) as c b 1 decreases (the function exhibits an
S-shaped pattern that is more pronounced for larger values
of c N 1). Typically, the decision weights of complementary
events sum to less than 1 (w( p) + w(1  p) b 1), a property
known as subcertainty ([61]). This property is satisfied
whenever d b 1. For chance prospects entailing possible
gains, Tversky and Fox [122] estimated values of d and c
for gains from the median responses of their sample of
college students to be .69 and .69, respectively. Tversky and
Kahneman [123] found similarly shaped weighting functions for losses and gains when they fitted a single parameter
function to their data. A more recent investigation using the
two-parameter function above suggests that whereas the
curvature parameter c does not vary significantly between
losses and gains, the elevation parameter d tends to be
significantly higher for losses than gains [3].
The prospect theory parameters a, b, k, c, and d can all
be estimated for individuals using simple choice tasks on
computer. Although the typically measured values of these
parameters suggest an S-shaped value function (0 b a, b b 1)
with loss aversion (k N 1) and an inverse-S-shaped
weighting function (0 b c b 1) that crosses the identity line
below .5 (0 b d b 1), there is considerable heterogeneity
between individuals in these measured parameters. For
instance, in a sample of ten psychology graduate students
evaluating gambles involving only the possibility of gains,
Gonzalez and Wu [49] obtained measures of a ranging from
.23 to .68, d ranging from .21 to 1.51, and c ranging from
.15 to .89.
In sum, prospect theory explains attitudes toward risk
via distortions in the shapes of the value and weighting
functions. The parameters obtained by Tversky and Kahneman [123] and Tversky and Fox [122] suggest that the
fourfold pattern of risk attitudes for simple prospects that
offer a gain or a loss with low or high probability (Table
3a) is driven primarily by curvature of the weighting
function because the value function is not especially curved
for the typical participant in those studies (with a = b =
.88). Pronounced risk aversion for mixed prospects that
offer an equal probability of a gain or loss (Table 3b) is
driven almost entirely by loss aversion because the
curvature of the value function is similar for losses versus
gains and the decision weights are similar for gain versus
loss components.
3.2. Framing and editing operations
Expected utility theory and most normative models of
decision making under risk assume the principle of
description invariance: Preferences among prospects
should not be affected by how they are described. Decision
makers act as if they are assessing the impact of options on

<-----Page 5----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

final states of wealth. Prospect theory, in contrast, explicitly
acknowledges that choices are influenced by how prospects
are cognitively represented in terms of losses versus gains
and their associated probabilities.
First, this representation can be systematically influenced
by the way in which options are described or bframed.Q
Recall that the value function is applied to a reference point
that distinguishes between losses and gains. A common
default reference point is the status quo. However, by
varying the description of options, one can influence how
they are perceived. For instance, decisions concerning
medical treatments can differ depending on whether
possible outcomes are described in terms of survival versus
mortality rates [84]. Second, the weighting function is
applied to probabilities of risky outcomes that a decision
maker happens to identify. The description of gambles can
influence whether probabilities are integrated or segregated
and, therefore, affect the decisions that people make [62].
For instance, people were more likely to favor a .25
chance of $32 over a .20 chance of $40 when this choice
was described as a two-stage game in which there was a
.25 chance of obtaining a choice between $32 for sure or
an .80 chance of $40 (in the two-stage game version
people are apparently attracted to the pseudo-certainty of
receiving $32). People may also actively reframe prospects, adopting aspirations as reference points [51] or
persisting in the adoption of old reference points, viewing
recent winnings as bhouse moneyQ [120].3
Third, people may mentally transform or beditQ the
description of prospects they have been presented. The
original formulation of prospect theory [61] suggested that
decision makers edit prospects in forming their subjective
representation. Consider prospects of the form ($x 1, p 1; $x 2,
p 2; $x 3, p 3) that offer $x i with (disjoint) probability p i (and
nothing otherwise). In particular, decision makers are
assumed to (1) combine common outcomes of a prospect—for example, a prospect that offers ($10, .1; $10, .1)
would be naturally represented as ($10, .2); (2) segregate
sure outcomes from the representation of a prospect—for
instance, a prospect that offers ($20, .5; $30, .5) would be
naturally represented as $20 for sure plus ($10, .5); (3)
cancel shared components of options that are offered
together—for example, a choice between ($10, .1; $50,
.1) or ($10, .1; $20, .2) would be naturally represented as a
choice between ($50, .1) or ($20, .2); (4) simplify prospects
by rounding uneven number or discarding extremely
unlikely outcomes—for example, ($99, .51; $5, .0001)
might be naturally represented as ($100, .5); (5) reject
options without further evaluation if they are obviously
dominated by other options—for instance, given a choice
between ($18, .1; $19, .1; $20, .1) or ($20, .3), most people
would naturally reject the first option because it is
stochastically dominated by the second.

3.3. Summarizing the key elements of prospect theory
Prospect theory has been very successful in explaining a
wide range of empirical regularities that have been
documented outside the laboratory (see [22])—from the
premium that equities demand over annuities in the market
[16] and the tendency to hold on to losing stocks too long
while selling winners too early [90] to the attractiveness of
state lotteries (cf. [25]). It also provides a flexible framework for modeling empirical regularities and individual
differences that have been observed in laboratory studies.
The key elements of prospect theory may be summarized
as follows (see Table 4). The first two elements refer to the
valuation of outcomes, the next two refer to the weighting of
probabilities, and the last two refer to the representation of
prospects.
3.3.1. Curvature of the value function
The value function is concave for gains and convex for
losses (e.g., [1,2,49]). This has been typically attributed to the
psychophysics of diminishing sensitivity. Generally, the curvature of the value function is relatively small and, therefore,
may not contribute substantially to measured risk attitudes;
Tversky and Kahneman [123] estimated a = b = .88 using the
median response of participants, which are close to values
obtained by several other researchers (however, Gonzalez and
Wu [49] estimated a = .49). Curvature of the value function
plays a greater role in riskless choice (see e.g., [118,119]).
3.3.2. Loss aversion
Losses loom larger than equivalent gains. This is
modeled by a value function with a loss limb that is steeper
than the gains limb (the parameter k N 1 in Eq. (4) above).
In risky choice, this is manifested as strong risk aversion for
mixed (gain–loss) gambles. For instance, most people
would reject a gamble for which they gain $100 if a fair
coin lands heads and lose $100 if a fair coin lands tails.
Typically, losses have at least twice the impact of equivalent
gains (i.e., k z 2) so that people would require a 50%
chance of gaining at least $200 to make up for a 50% of
losing $100 ([123], see also [2,64,63] for an explanation of
why loss aversion is needed to explain risk aversion for
mixed gambles see [97]).
3.3.3. Curvature of the weighting function
The inverse-S-shaped weighting function is characterized
by a tendency to overweight low probabilities and underweight moderate to high probabilities (modeled by c b 1 in
Eq. (5)). This shape is typically attributed to the psychophysics of diminishing sensitivity [1,19,49,122,123]. The robust
fourfold pattern of risk attitudes (Table 3) suggests that
distortions in probability weighting are more pronounced
than distortions in value: Although the shape of the value
function implies risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for
losses, this pattern seems to be reversed for low-probability
events and reinforced for high-probability events.

Prospect representation

3.3.4. Elevation of the weighting function
The sum of decision weights for complementary probabilities is typically less than one (i.e., w( p) + w(1  p) b 1),
a principle known as bsubcertainty.Q This implies a weighting function that crosses the identity line below .5 (modeled
by d b 1 in Eq. (5)). Loosely speaking, this reflects a more
pronounced tendency to underweight probabilities than to
overweight them. The overall attractiveness of risky
prospects varies from individual to individual, and this is
modeled by individual differences in the elevation of the
weighting function (see [49]).
3.3.5. Framing effects
Cognitive representations of prospects influence how
they are evaluated, in terms of losses and gains relative to
some reference point and the association of probabilities
with consequences. These representations can be systematically influenced by the way in which options are described
so that people make different choices among the same
prospects that are characterized in different ways.
3.3.6. Editing operations
When subjectively representing prospects, decision makers may actively edit prospects from the way in which they are
originally described, usually to simplify the representation.
3.4. Affective substrates of prospect theory
Prospect theory provides a characterization of decision
making under risk that emphasizes cognitive operations of
representation and the psychophysics of diminishing sensi-

tivity. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that
affect plays a prominent role in risky choice (for reviews,
see [76,85,105]). In particular, a number of recent studies
point to an affective component underlying observed
features of the value and weighting functions. This is of
particular interest given the involvement of limbic brain
regions in decision making, to be discussed further below.
3.4.1. Curvature of the value function
The degree of curvature of the value function represents a
decision maker’s sensitivity to increasing units gained or lost.
Although cognitive appraisal of scope (i.e., number of units)
surely plays a role in the representation of value for fungible
resources such as money, several researchers have argued that
people may also rely on their affective response to possible
outcomes as a bcommon currencyQ for assessing value and
making tradeoffs among disparate items (e.g., [93,113] cf.
[87]). To the extent that decision makers assess value based
on affective reactions, they should be relatively insensitive to
the quantity of the item being evaluated (for several
examples, see [66]) and the corresponding value function
will, therefore, be relatively flat. Indeed, Hsee and Rottenstreich [55] find that the value function exhibits greater
curvature (i.e., lower slope above a minimum number of units
gained or lost) for consequences that are more baffect-rich.Q
For instance, in one study, participants were asked how much
they would be willing to pay to save various numbers of
pandas that were each represented either by cute pictures (an
baffect-richQ representation) or dots (an baffect-poorQ representation). In the affect-poor (dots) conditions, participants
were willing to donate about twice as much if they had been

<-----Page 7----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

asked about four pandas than if they had been asked about a
single panda. However, in the affect-rich condition (photos),
participants were willing to pay about the same amount if
they had been asked about one panda or four pandas.
3.4.2. Loss aversion
Although the affective sources of loss aversion are poorly
understood, loss aversion does appear to be moderated by
affect. For example, the affective richness of consumption
goods seems to enhance differences in perceived value of
gaining versus losing these items. Dhar and Wertenbroch
[29] report that loss aversion is more pronounced for
bhedonic goodsQ (goods rated bpleasant and fun, something
that appeals to the senses. . .Q) than utilitarian goods (goods
rated buseful, practical, functional. . ..Q). For instance, in one
study, participants were about equally likely to choose a $7
gift certificate for a music CD or audio tape (a hedonic
good) over a $7 gift certificate for computer disks (a
functional good), suggesting that these two goods were
viewed as equally attractive when considered as potential
gains. In contrast, participants who were given both gift
certificates were then later asked to give one up were five
times as likely to surrender the computer disk certificate as
the music certificate, suggesting that loss aversion was more
pronounced for the more affect-laden option. In the context
of risky choice, ambient affective states seem to moderate
loss aversion. Isen et al. [57] report that participants placed
in a positive mood (for instance, by giving them an
unexpected small bag of candy) tend to exhibit greater risk
aversion for mixed (gain–loss) gambles and that this effect
appears to be driven by greater sensitivity to possible losses
rather than greater appreciation of possible gains.
3.4.3. Curvature of the weighting function
Although traditional accounts of the curvature of the
weighting function stress the psychophysics of diminishing
sensitivity (e.g., [123]), others have speculated that affective
responses to gambles, such as hope and fear ([122], p. 282) or
anticipated elation versus disappointment [20], may play a
role. Indeed, Rottenstreich and Hsee [104] report that the
curvature of the weighting function seems to be more
pronounced for more baffect-richQ consequences, such as a
kiss from a movie star or an electrical shock, than for baffectrichQ consequences such as money. In one study, participants
were asked to price a .01 and a .99 chance of receiving a
hypothetical $500 gift certificate. For one group, the
certificate would go toward payment of university tuition
(an affect-poor prize) and for a second group the certificate
would go toward a European vacation (an affect-rich prize).
For the .01 chance, the median participant in the vacation
condition was willing to pay more ($20) than the median
participant in the tuition condition ($5). However, for the .99
chance, the median participant in the vacation condition was
willing to pay less ($450) than the median participant in the
tuition condition ($478). In a similar vein, Faro and Rottenstreich [37] find that people anticipate that others’ decisions

41

will reflect a less pronounced fourfold pattern of risk attitudes
than their own decisions (i.e., more linear weighting of
probabilities), but people who score higher on a standard
empathy concern scale (and are therefore better able to
bappreciate others’ emotional reactionsQ) tend to be more
accurate.
3.4.4. Elevation of the weighting function
There is some evidence that overall risk preferences for
pure gain and loss gambles are influenced by affective
states, which may be reflected in differences in the elevation
of the weighting function (or possibly the degree of
curvature of the value function). For instance, Mano [78]
finds that participants reporting higher states of arousal were
willing to pay more to play lotteries of various probabilities
(indicating greater risk seeking, consistent with a more
elevated weighting function for gains) and were willing to
pay less to insure against possible losses of various
probabilities (indicating less risk aversion, consistent with
a less elevated weighting function for losses). Lerner and
Keltner [75] report that people who score higher on a scale
of dispositional fear tend to be more risk-averse whereas
people who score higher on a scale of dispositional anger
tend to be more risk-seeking.

4. The neural basis of risky decision making
Although the study of decision making using cognitive
neuroscience techniques is relatively young, a growing body
of evidence suggests that decision making under risk is
mediated by a network of cortical and limbic structures
devoted to processing sensory, cognitive, and affective
information, as well as widely-projecting neuromodulatory
systems. In the discussion to follow, we will outline a set of
preliminary hypotheses regarding the neural systems that
may underlie some of the specific features of prospect
theory. These hypotheses are summarized in Table 5. We
first outline the important distinction between decision
utility and experience utility. We then describe the state of
current knowledge regarding the representation of utility, the
representation of probability, and the processes involved in
prospect representation.
It should be noted at the outset that, whereas much of
the literature cited here comes from experimental studies of
non-human animals, prospect theory has to date only been
applied to human decision making. However, because
fundamental psychological processes are likely to be at
least partially conserved between human and non-human
decision making (for example, see Marsh and Kacelnik
[80] for a prospect theory-informed study of risky decision
making in birds; Real [98] for a discussion of the Allais
Paradox relating to the foraging behavior of bumblebees;
Weber et al. [127] for a comparison of risk sensitivity in
humans versus foraging birds and insects), the appeal to
neuroscientific data from animals can provide useful insights

evaluations are dominated by evaluations of salient moments
(the peak and end of an experience) and underweight the
duration of experiences (e.g., [59]). Thus, it is important to
distinguish the representation of experienced reward and
punishment (which may correspond to experience utility)
from anticipated reward and punishment (which may
correspond to predicted or decision utility). Results from
cognitive neuroscience suggest that this distinction may be
reflected in the roles of different brain systems in decision
making. Of particular relevance, Berridge and Robinson [19]
have distinguished between the bwantingQ (presumably
reflecting decision utility) and blikingQ (presumably reflecting experience utility) aspects of motivation. We now review
the neural bases of each of these forms of utility in turn.
4.1.1. Decision utility
Regions involved in decision utility should exhibit
activity related to the anticipation of rewards or the assessment of subjective value of future events. Human and nonhuman animal studies provide evidence for the roles of the
dopamine system, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, and
amygdala in the representation of decision utility.

4.1. Neural representations of utility

4.1.1.1. Dopamine system. Dopamine (DA) is a modulatory neurotransmitter that is produced by regions in the
midbrain (the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral
tegmental area) and transmitted broadly to a set of cortical
and subcortical regions [26]. The dopaminergic system
appears to be a primary substrate for the representation of
decision utility. A number of studies (reviewed by [108])
have shown that dopamine neurons increase their firing for
unexpected rewards and for stimuli that predict future
rewards, whereas they decrease their firing in the absence of
an expected reward. However, it is critical to note that DA
does not appear to code directly for the hedonic value of
rewards, as blockade of DA receptors does not reduce the
desirability of rewarding stimuli [56]. Rather, DA blockade
results in blikingQ without bwantingQ [18]; animals will fail
to act to obtain rewards but will nonetheless express
pleasure at receipt of the reward. One possibility is that
DA codes for the incentive value of stimuli, which
subsequently guides action selection (e.g., [18,82]).

Kahneman et al. [65] distinguish between bdecision
utility,Q which refers to the weight of an outcome in a
decision, and bexperience utility,Q which refers to its hedonic
quality. Although it is decision utility that is the primary
focus of prospect theory, both forms of utility are important
for understanding the neural basis of decision making.
Decision utility may be derived from predictions of the
experience utility of different options, which in turn may be
influenced by retrospective evaluations of similar past
experiences. However, Kahneman et al. [65] review a
number of contexts in which people’s retrospective evaluations and their decisions do not accord with their on-line
ratings of experience utility—for instance, retrospective

4.1.1.2. Ventral striatum. The ventral striatum (including
the nucleus accumbens or NAc) serves as a locus for signal
integration between the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and
hippocampus (for review, see [125]) and a wealth of recent
data suggest that it plays a critical role in the representation of
anticipated reward magnitude (reviewed by [69]). In one
study, Breiter et al. [21] visually represented several gain and
loss outcomes using different roulette wheel bspinnersQ.
Using fMRI, these authors found modulation of ventral striatal responses to the expectation and experience of monetary
gains and losses, and a clear monotonic increase in activity
during exposure to a riskless bgains onlyQ stimulus (but see
[31]). Similarly, using a monetary incentive delay task,

into the basic neural mechanisms underlying these psychological processes.

<-----Page 9----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

Knutson et al. [70] demonstrated that NAc activity increases
in anticipation of larger rewards. The ventral striatum is a
primary target of the DA system, and changes in ventral
striatal activity seen during neuroimaging may reflect either
DA activity or the intrinsic activity of ventral striatal neurons.
4.1.1.3. Prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is a large
and heterogeneous brain region, and it appears that different
regions may play different roles in decision making. The
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is particularly
important for the maintenance and manipulation of cognitive representations in working memory and the planning of
future actions based on those representations. One possibility is that this region plays a role in decision making
related to the representation of prospects and subsequent
decision utility computations. On the Iowa Gambling Task
(IGT), a popular neuropsychological test of decision making
[12], patients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex show decision making impairments. In this task,
subjects are presented with four decks of cards with varying
monetary payoff values and must choose among the decks
to maximize their total payout. Two of the decks have
negative expected value and high risk, whereas the
remaining decks are less risky and have positive expected
values. Patients with DLPFC lesions do not learn to choose
optimally on this task [39,77]. These deficits may reflect an
inability to use strategies or rules to control behavior such
that DLPFC patients behave in a disorganized manner; for
example, patients with DLPFC lesions were able to
accurately assess the quality of financial advice on a task
involving the management of a simulated business but were
unable to actually use the advice in making decisions [48].
The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) also
appears to be involved in the development of anticipatory
responses to losses. Patients with lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit normal skin conductance
responses (SCR4) to experienced losses in the IGT but fail
to develop anticipatory SCRs to risky choices as normal
subjects do [13]. However, imaging studies have associated
VMPFC more strongly with experienced reward than with
reward anticipation, as discussed below.
4.1.1.4. Amygdala. The amygdala is a complex subcortical
structure that is heavily involved in emotion and learning,
particularly for negative outcomes (but also possibly for
positive outcomes, see [11]). The amygdala is essential for
both the production of fear responses and for the learning of
associations between particular stimuli and fear responses
(see Fanselow and LeDoux [36] for review). It is also
involved in the perception of fearful facial expressions [88].
As discussed in greater detail below, it appears that the
amygdala plays a key role in the representation of experience
utility for losses. However, the amygdala also appears to be

43

important for decision utility regarding negative outcomes.
In the IGT, patients with amygdala lesions do not learn to
choose the less risky, positive expected value decks.
Whereas normal (control) subjects develop anticipatory
SCRs in response to choices from the risky decks following
practice, patients with amygdala lesions do not develop such
responses nor do they exhibit normal increases in SCRs to
losses [14]. These results suggest that the acquisition of
fearful anticipatory SCRs to losses requires the amygdala.
Neuroimaging results have shown that the amygdala is active
during the anticipation of losses ([21,58]).
4.1.2. Experience utility
Regions sensitive to experience utility should exhibit
activity during the experience of positive or negative
outcomes and show modulation according to the valence
and/or magnitude of the outcome. The neural basis of
experience utility has been associated with a network of
limbic, brainstem, and cortical areas. In particular, neuroimaging results have implicated the striatum and orbital and
ventromedial prefrontal cortices in the processing of
experienced rewards and the amygdala in the processing
of experienced losses.
4.1.2.1. Striatum. The striatum is a complex structure that
can be separated into the dorsal striatum (including the
caudate nucleus and dorsal putamen) and the ventral
striatum (including the nucleus accumbens and ventral
putamen), each of which participates in different corticostriatal loops (e.g., [50]). In particular, the ventral striatum
receives inputs primarily from limbic structures such as the
hippocampus, amygdala, and VMPFC, whereas the dorsal
striatum receives inputs primarily from dorsal and lateral
prefrontal cortices. The ventral striatum appears to respond
to both anticipated rewards [70] and experienced rewards
[21], whereas the dorsal striatum (including the caudate
nucleus) appears to play a distinct role in the processing of
experienced reward magnitude and valence. For example,
Delgado et al. [28] described a direct relationship between
reward magnitude and valence, and activity in the dorsal
striatum. These authors employed an event-related fMRI
procedure in which subjects received monetary rewards and
punishments of varying size dependent upon performance in
a gambling task. Their findings showed that the degree of
activation of the caudate nucleus varied consistently with
both the magnitude and valence of the reward; the caudate
nucleus responded most for large rewards and least for large
punishments. Similarly, Knutson et al. [70] found that dorsal
striatal areas respond differentially to the receipt of large
gains and losses. As with the DA system, it is thought that
the role of the striatum is closely tied to action selection; for
example, the response of the striatum to rewards that are
contingent upon behavior is greater than for rewards that are
not contingent upon behavior ([121,131]. It is also unclear
to what degree these striatal responses reflect DA activity
versus cortical inputs to the striatum.

<-----Page 10----->44

C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

4.1.2.2. Prefrontal cortex. The ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (VMPFC) has been associated with the receipt of
rewards [71,91,100] and with the evaluation of desirable
stimuli [34]. Furthermore, activity in this region correlates
with subjective taste preferences for beverages [83],
suggesting that activity in the region is sensitive to the
relative subjective desirability of experienced stimuli.
Patients with lesions to the VMPFC are impaired at the
Iowa Gambling Task [12,15], that is, they never develop a
preference for the bsafeQ decks in the IGT (i.e., those with
positive expected value), tending to continue choosing from
the briskyQ decks (i.e., those with negative expected value).
However, these patients do exhibit normal SCR responses to
experienced losses [13], suggesting that VMPFC is not
necessary for the emotional experience of a loss. Rather, the
impairment of VMPFC patients on the IGT appears to
reflect an impairment of executive control over behavior
rather than one of value representation per se. Fellows and
Farah [38] used a shuffled version of the IGT in which the
losses associated with each deck were encountered within
the first few trials, thereby reducing the reversal learning
aspect of the task. Although VMPFC lesion patients were
impaired at the standard IGT, they were unimpaired at the
shuffled version, suggesting that their impairment is related
to the reversal requirement.
The anterior cingulate cortex is also sensitive to the
experience of negative outcomes, as reflected in the feedback error-related negativity (ERN) event-related brain
potential. The ERN is greater for losses than for gains in a
gambling task [45]. Of particular interest in this study is the
fact that the ERN occurred even when the actual loss was
smaller than an alternative possible loss (i.e., a relatively
positive outcome), suggesting that it uniquely reflects the
negative aspect of outcome value. One recent proposal
suggests that the increased ERN for negative feedback
reflects decreases in phasic dopaminergic signals to the
anterior cingulate cortex which, in turn, signal negative
prediction error [54]. Thus, ERN responses for negative
outcomes may be a reflection of dopaminergic activity.
4.1.2.3. Amygdala. The amygdala may be involved
specifically in the representation of negative outcomes.
The primary evidence in favor of this is that patients with
lesions to the amygdala show learning impairments on
the IGT. The amygdala appears to play a role in the
processing of losses per se, as patients with amygdala
lesions do not exhibit normal SCRs to losses in the IGT
[14]. This may reflect the amygdala’s more general role
in the processing of fear-related stimuli, reflected in its
mediation of fear conditioning [72,81] and in the
processing of fearful facial expressions [88]. Interestingly,
there is some evidence to suggest that the amygdala may
also encode information concerning gains ([44]; see also
[6] for data suggesting that the amygdala’s apparent
negative bias may result, in part, from the higher average
intensity of negative stimuli).

4.2. Neural representation of outcome probability
From the standpoint of prospect theory, the important
aspects of probability representation are the curvature of the
weighting function (reflecting the underweighting of high
probabilities and overweighting of low probabilities) and the
elevation of the weighting function (representing the overall
willingness to entertain risk). Current neuroscientific research does not provide direct evidence regarding the
mechanisms underlying these phenomena, but recent work
has begun to elucidate the regions that are involved in the
representation of outcome probabilities.
A substantial body of recent work examining the cortical
representation of outcome probability has examined oculomotor tasks in primates. This work has focused on the lateral
intraparietal area (LIP), a region that shows modulated
activity during oculomotor tasks [102,109] and that acts to
guide saccadic eye movements in a manner believed to
reflect motor planning activity [47,114]. The importance of
LIP in the representation of reward probability was
demonstrated by Platt and Glimcher [94], who trained
monkeys to make visual saccades into and out of the
receptive fields of individual LIP neurons in exchange for
juice rewards of varying magnitude and delivery probability.
Significantly greater activation was seen in LIP neurons
when saccades were instructed with a reward probability of
80% compared to when equivalent movement was
instructed with a reward probability of 20%. That is, the
activity of individual LIP neurons changed according to the
probability that a particular response would result in a
reward. Remarkably, movement amplitude, latency, and
velocity did not change with outcome probability and, thus,
it seems apparent that LIP neuronal activity is correlated
with the probability that a particular (rewarded) response
will be required regardless of the movement actually made.
Subsequently, Sugrue et al. [117] also affirmed a convincing
role for the LIP in the representation of reward probability
as assayed through saccades. After training rhesus
monkeys in a visual discrimination task involving a
fixation, delay, and saccade routine, unit recordings were
made in LIP as the animals made choices between stimuli
linked to high and low-probability rewards. LIP neurons
matched for receptive field properties showed differential
activity depending on anticipated reward probability and,
moreover, in the presence of low-probability reward the
activity of these units became tonic as their discriminability declined. It must be noted that, because these
studies did not vary magnitude as well as probability, it is
not possible to determine whether LIP is representing
probability per se or some function of probability (e.g.,
expected utility). In addition, it is not clear how these
findings extend to other task domains or whether they are
specific to eye movements.
Reward probability may also be represented less directly
by the dopamine system. In a discrimination learning task,
Fiorillo et al. [40] found that dopaminergic neuronal activity

<-----Page 11----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

varied monotonically with reward outcome probability.
These authors trained monkeys on a visual discrimination
task and recorded the activity of single dopaminergic
neurons under conditions in which the receipt of a reward
was maximally uncertain (50% reward) and maximally
certain (0% or 100% reward). These neurons responded to
rewards when they were unexpected (i.e., 0% condition) and
to cues that predicted reward (i.e., 100% condition). In
addition, dopaminergic neurons showed monotonically
increasing phasic activation during the delay period for
stimuli that were maximally unpredictable (i.e., 50%
condition). Similar results were found in humans using
fMRI by Aron et al. [9]. In this study, activity in the
midbrain (putatively dopaminergic regions) was modulated
by the predictability of subsequent cognitive feedback
during a probabilistic learning task. That both of these
studies find greatest activity during conditions of maximal
uncertainty suggests that the dopamine system, rather than
directly coding probability, may be coding for the degree of
risk associated with a decision.
4.3. Prospect theory and the brain
The foregoing review outlines a relatively complex set of
neural structures and interactions involved in the representation of decision and experience utility and probability. We
now turn to examine how these data might be related to the
value and weighting functions of prospect theory.
4.3.1. Shape of the value function
Curvature of the value function in prospect theory
appears to be similar for gains and losses [2,123]. This
suggests that a common process may be involved in the
representation of value magnitude regardless of valance
(i.e., equally for both gains and losses). Consistent with
this hypothesis, there is evidence from neuroscience to
suggest that several neural systems involved in value
representation may separately represent valence and
magnitude, at least for experienced outcomes. Analyzing
human event-related potentials, Yeung and Sanfey [130]
demonstrated that the well-characterized P300 eventrelated potential is sensitive to reward magnitude but not
valence, whereas the subsequent feedback-related ERN
showed the reverse pattern. Thus, the neuroscientific data
provide at least qualified support for the existence of
systems that respond uniquely to magnitude regardless of
valence. However, this segregation is not complete, as the
striatum appears to be sensitive to both the magnitude and
valence of outcomes (e.g., [28]).
4.3.2. Loss and risk aversion
In prospect theory, the value function is typically 2–3
times steeper for losses than for equivalent gains. For mixed
(gain/loss) prospects, loss aversion gives rise to pronounced
risk aversion. From a neural standpoint, one might surmise
that loss aversion arises from the differential influence of

45

responses in the various systems that code for positive and
negative expected values. The ventral striatum may be a
central locus for the integration of these signals, as it
receives inputs from amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal
cortex as well as dopaminergic inputs from the midbrain and
therefore has access to signals coding for both positive and
negative value. For learning tasks involving reward associations (e.g., the IGT), it is clear that lesions to the amygdala
and ventromedial prefrontal cortex result in decreased risk
aversion. However, no published studies have examined
these patients on pure or mixed gambles of the sort
discussed above and, thus, it is not known whether these
deficits persist when the learning demands are removed.
Recent results showing that VMPFC lesion patients can
perform the IGT normally under particular circumstances
[39] suggest that their deficits reflect learning problems
more than they reflect a general modulation of loss aversion.
These findings are consistent with those of Rolls and
colleagues (e.g., [103]) suggesting that the orbitofrontal
cortex may be specifically involved in reversal of reward
associations.
Recent evidence also suggests that the noradrenergic
system may be important for loss aversion. Noradrenaline is
known to mediate anxiety and stress (for reviews, see
[46,89]) and has been shown to play a role in posttraumatic stress reactions [115] and the consolidation of
fear memories [73]. Rogers et al. [101] examined the effect
of central NA blockade on decision making in healthy
volunteers through the administration of propranolol (a hadrenergic antagonist). Subjects were presented with mixed
gain–loss gambles as well as pure gain and loss gambles.
Participants administered a single 80 mg dose of propranolol appeared to be less sensitive to the magnitude of
possible losses for mixed (gain–loss) gambles when the
probability of loss was high (though not when it was low),
whereas their sensitivity toward the magnitude of possible
gains was not significantly affected. In contrast, propranolol
and control participants displayed roughly equal tendencies
toward risk aversion for pure gain gambles and risk seeking
for pure loss gambles. Taken together, this pattern is
consistent with the hypothesis that the drug affects loss
aversion (k in prospect theory) rather than curvature of the
value function (a and b). Further studies are necessary to
determine whether manipulation of other neurotransmitter
systems also affects loss aversion. For example, although
the modulatory neurotransmitter serotonin is thought to
underlie the response to punishment (e.g., [27]), studies of
decision making following tryptophan depletion (which
reduces serotonin levels) suggest that loss aversion is not
affected [99].
4.3.3. Curvature of the weighting function
The weighting function in prospect theory is inverse-Sshaped, reflecting overweighting of low probabilities and
underweighting of high probabilities. A critical question
arising from prospect theory is why the probability

<-----Page 12----->46

C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

weighting function takes this particular shape. The standard explanation for this finding has appealed to the
psychophysics of diminishing sensitivity, but other evidence suggests that it may instead (or in addition) reflect
emotional aspects of the decision. In particular, the
underweighting of high-probability gains and overweighting of low-probability losses may reflect fear, whereas the
overweighting of low-probability gains and high-probability losses may reflect hope. The neural bases of these
functions are not currently known. However, one might
hypothesize that fear would involve the amygdala, whereas
hope would involve the ventral striatum. It is also possible
that the risk-related DA activity observed by Fiorillo et al.
[40] in anticipation of uncertain rewards may reflect
bhopeQ, although this is speculative at present.
4.3.4. Elevation of the weighting function
The weighting function is generally characterized by
bsubcertaintyQ in which decision weights for complementary prospects sum to less than 1. This is manifested as a
more pronounced tendency toward risk aversion than risk
seeking for simple gambles involving gains (and presumably a more pronounced tendency toward risk seeking than
risk aversion for simple gambles involving losses). There is
little current evidence regarding the neural substrates for
elevation of the weighting function in general, or subcertainty in particular. However, we speculate that elevation
of the weighting function may be related to impulsivity,
given that the impulsive acceptance of gambles would
result in an increase in weighting function elevation
(prospect theory parameter d). This would suggest that
elevation may be related to the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, both of which are associated with impulsivity [24,35]. It is also of great interest that there is a
substantial degree of individual variability in weighting
function elevation [49]. If a link between DA/5-HT systems
and elevation is established, then future genetic association
studies focused on these transmitter systems could possibly
provide an explanation for some of the individual differences observed in elevation.
4.3.5. Framing and editing operations
The representational aspects of prospect theory, encompassing framing effects and editing operations, concern
how the representations of prospects affect their utility and
how these representations can be manipulated or altered by
the decision maker. Although there is little evidence
regarding the neural basis of these components, several
results provide the basis for preliminary speculations. In
particular, recent dual-process models of judgment and
choice have distinguished spontaneous, associative, affective processing (bSystem IQ) from effortful, rule-based, and
cognitive processing (bSystem IIQ; see [33,111,116]).
Kahneman [60] argues that many judgment and decision
processes may be governed by a combination of both forms
of processing. For instance, the use of memory accessibility

or similarity judgment to assess likelihood (the availability
and representativeness heuristics) or the use of affective
responses to make choices (the affect heuristic) may reflect
System I processing. On the other hand, the use of higherorder reasoning to detect inconsistencies in judgment or
dominance in choice may reflect System II processing. In
the context of prospect theory, we surmise that passive
framing, valuation, and probability weighting processes
may be governed primarily by System I, whereas active
framing and editing may be governed primarily by System
II. As the foregoing review suggests, System I operations
are likely to rely upon limbic and basal ganglia regions.
The more controlled processes associated with System II
are more likely to rely upon the lateral and dorsomedial
prefrontal cortices (e.g., [86]).
Although no neuroscientific studies have directly exaQ
mined framing effects, there is suggestive evidence that
the degree to which an outcome is viewed as a relative
gain or loss affects the neural processing of the outcome.
Breiter et al. [21] compared the response to a $0 outcome
when it was either the best or worst outcome among three
possible outcomes. The response to the outcome in the
ventral striatum was greater when it was viewed as a gain
than as a loss. Similarly, the response to rewards in ventral
striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex differs when
the reward occurs in the context of a winning streak
[30]. Thus, there is suggestive evidence that the processing
of reward depends upon the context in which it occurs.
There are no current results that address the issue of
reframing.
Editing processes, which involve the spontaneous
reformulation of prospects, are likely to heavily involve
working memory and executive control processes and, thus,
may be reliant upon dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. In
addition, editing processes likely require inhibition of
prepotent (automatic) responses to allow manipulation of
the prospect before making a decision. To the degree that
editing requires controlled processing, it may be necessary
to inhibit a relatively fast and automatic response driven by
System I. Such inhibition is likely to involve the right
lateral prefrontal cortex [8], as well as the DA and NA
systems [7]. Consistent with this proposal is the fact that
patients with VMPFC lesions appear to be impaired at
suppressing their initial response on the basis of new
information in the IGT [39].

5. Future directions
As the foregoing review outlines, there is a large body
of suggestive evidence regarding the neural basis of
decision making, and it is possible to at least weakly
associate neural systems with the different components of
prospect theory. Further work will be needed to better
judge the degree to which this theory provides leverage
towards understanding the neural basis of decision making.

<-----Page 13----->C. Trepel et al. / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 34–50

Some of the most interesting outstanding questions
include:
5.1. How can we extend the present account from decisions
under risk to decisions under uncertainty?
In this paper, we have focused on decision making under
risk, where the probabilities of possible outcomes are
known precisely by the decision maker. Indeed, the
probability weighting function from prospect theory applies
only to these contexts. It is an important question how to
extend the treatment from risk to uncertainty, where
decision makers must judge for themselves the probabilities,
with some degree of vagueness or imprecision. Cumulative
prospect theory [123] provides such an extension and a
characterization of decision weights under uncertainty can
be found in both Tversky and Fox [122] and Wu and
Gonzalez [128]. Subsequent studies have found that
decisions under uncertainty adhere reasonably closely to
the predictions of a btwo-stage modelQ in which decision
makers first assess the probabilities of events themselves,
then weight these judged probabilities according to the same
inverse-S-shaped function that they use for decisions under
risk ([42,43,122,128]; but see [67]).5
Recently, Barron and Erev ([10]; see also [53])
examined bsmall feedback-basedQ decisions in which
small decisions are repeated many times so that the
probabilities of relevant outcomes are learned over time
from experience rather than provided explicitly to
participants. Similarly, Hertwig et al. [53] examined
decisions in which participants were allowed to learn
the probability distribution of possible outcomes by
sampling from a distribution with replacement before
making a choice among prospects. In an intriguing set of
studies, these authors observed patterns of behavior that
on their surface seem to reverse the patterns of over- and
underweighting previously documented by Kahneman and
Tversky and others. We say bon their surfaceQ because it
is important to recognize that these studies entailed
uncertainty rather than risk. Although one could, in
principle, compare decision weights to the probability
distributions from which outcomes were sampled with
replacement, such a comparison is not particularly meaningful in prospect theory. For one thing, the sample that a
particular participant observes is unlikely to coincide with
the process that generated it. Moreover, even if the sample
does perfectly reflect the process that generated it, there is

5
Although the two-stage model fits the data quite well, a third stage is
needed to accommodate ambiguity aversion [32] and the preference to
bet on more familiar domains of uncertainty such as the domestic, rather
than a foreign, stock market. This third stage might be modeled as a
shift in the elevation of decision weights in situations where the decision
maker feels especially knowledgeable or ignorant relative to other
domains or people (for more detailed discussions, see [43], pp. 892–893;
[42]).

47

no particular reason to believe that a participant’s
subjective beliefs will necessarily coincide with the
relative frequency of events that they observed. Thus, it
appears that these effects are driven primarily by
distortions in belief rather than distortions in the weighting of probabilities. Indeed, when Fox and Tversky ([43],
Study 2) presented participants with an entire distribution
of events, participants subsequently overestimated the
probability of drawing low-frequency events and underestimated the probability of drawing high-frequency
events. Moreover, decision weights under uncertainty
reflected the same over- and underweighting of these
judged probabilities as did decision weights under risk in
which participants were provided with probabilities.
At the neural level, it is likely that experience-based and
description-based decisions may rely upon overlapping but
partially separate sets of neural systems. In particular, the
dorsal striatum and DA system are important for learning
based on trial-by-trial feedback [95,110]. Examination of
feedback-based decision making would allow a greater
connection between the substantial literature on the cognitive neuroscience of learning. Particularly exciting is the
possibility that quantitative models of decision making, such
as prospect theory, could be interfaced with computational
learning models, providing a compound model of both
learning and decision making.
5.2. How are affective and cognitive signals integrated in
probability weighting?
A substantial body of work cited in this paper suggests
that decisions under risk, as modeled by prospect theory,
may be driven by both cognitive and affective signals.
Future research is needed to tease out the relative
contribution of these factors. For instance, Hsee and
Rottenstreich [55] distinguish bvaluation by calculationQ
from bvaluation by feelingQ and observe that the characteristic concave shape of the value function for gains may
reflect a weighted average of a linear function derived by
cognitive appraisals of quantity and a step function
implied by affective assessment of the nature of consequences. Likewise, we surmise that the characteristic
inverse-S shape of the weighting function may stem from
the combination of a cognitive assessment of probability
or expected value and adjustments due to the anticipatory
emotions hope (that a small probability gain might be
realized) and fear (that a large probability gain may not
be realized). These insights suggest that the neural
systems involved in probability weighting will likely
include convergence zones for emotional and cognitive
signals. As noted above, the ventral striatum is a likely
candidate for this sort of integration, given its connections
and its receipt of substantial DA inputs (cf. [125]). Future
work using paradigms that combine objective probability
weighting with emotionally laden stimuli could address
this issue.

5.3. What is the role of inhibition in decision making?
A number of studies have begun to focus on the role of
cognitive control processes in decision making, but relatively little attention has been paid to the role of response
inhibition (although see [39]). However, there a number of
clinical syndromes (e.g., attention deficit disorder, drug
abuse, and compulsive gambling) in which impairments of
decision making seem to largely reflect the inability to
inhibit immediate responses in favor of more optimal
delayed responses. The relationship between response
inhibition and the temporal discounting of rewards is not
currently known, and understanding this issue could provide
substantial leverage towards the characterization and treatment of decision making disorders.
