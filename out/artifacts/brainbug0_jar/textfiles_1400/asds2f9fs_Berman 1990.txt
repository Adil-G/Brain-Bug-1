In recent years, industry has increased its direct funding of
university
R&D. This article examines whether such “collaborative”
R&D leads to increases in technological
innovation
in industry. Data are analyzed for the years 1953 through 1986.
It is found that direct industry funding of university research is
associated
with subsequent
increases in industry
R&D expenditures.
These expenditures
include funding
from both
federal and industry sources. This increase in R&D expenditures occurs with a median lag of five years. Rival hypotheses
are examined, such as the effect of general university research
expenditures.
However,
these hypotheses
are rejected. This
article concludes by raising significant implications
for policy.

1. Introduction
University-industry
research relations have
drawn considerable attention in recent years. The
number of collaborative involvements has grown,
and this growth has been based on the premise
that university-industry
collaboration
increases
technological innovation and, hence, economic
competitiveness [24]. Support for collaboration has
come from both federal and non-federal sources.
The federal government, largely through the National Science Foundation (NSF), has increased
funding for university-industry
research collaboration through its new Engineering Research
Centers (ERC) program [12,15]. But many large
firms have also reported new university-industry
research interactions, not all with federal or state
support [6].
Notwithstanding the growth of these relationships, the current research consensus is that the
extent of technology development through these
relations is not well known [21], with the exception perhaps in biotechnology [2]. A significant

question is whether in fact university-industry
collaboration leads to increases in technological
innovation.
This research examines the relationship between university-industry
research collaboration
and subsequent research and development (R&D)
performed by industry. It does so by analyzing
aggregate data for the years 1953 through 1986.
Specifically, it examines whether industry-funded
university R&D, a measure of collaboration, is a
determinant of subsequent industry R&D
expenditures. These expenditures include funds from
both industry and federal sources. If industryfunded university R&D is found to be such a
determinant, then it can also be said to increase
economic competitiveness, since there is a consensus that technological innovation accounts for
25 to 50 percent of U.S. postwar economic growth
[41.

2. The theory of collaboration
The theory (or “model”) for hypothesizing a
positive relationship between collaboration and
innovation is derived from the research and teaching functions of research universities. Their role in
research makes universities repositories of advanced understanding. Though sometimes this
knowledge involves capabilities leading to new
industries such as biotechnology [9], more generally universities offer industry only a window on
advanced R&D capabilities, and highly specific
applications within this context [20]. Normally the
step from R&D vision to innovation is too large
for companies because they lack the necessary
long-term in-house research capabilities in one or
more areas of research [18]. Even technologically

strong firms occasionally find themselves weak in
critical areas of long-term research. Thus, for example, Hewlett-Packard
recently joined a consortium with other companies to increase its basic
understanding of research on biosensors. Boeing
has similarly sought to expand its knowledge of
software design principles [23]. These areas of
general understanding are relevant to the R&D of
these companies, but they are weak in them.
Collaboration
increases the utilization
and
transfer of such academic knowledge. Collaboration provides companies with informal access to
students and professors. The application of new
knowledge is often left to recently hired graduates
[20]. The use of students in collaborative research
as a part of their training is important too. Consulting by faculty also increases the application of
academic knowledge. Sometimes, companies send
their own scientists to university labs to acquire
new skills. Collaboration also focuses academic
research around industrially relevant concerns, and
it gives companies access to the university labs in
which advanced research is taking place 1171. For
these reasons, collaboration is hypothesized to increase the transfer of academic knowledge in industrially-relevant
areas. Since this knowledge
generally concerns targetted basic research applications, its impact on innovation should be considerable [ 191.
At the level of individual projects the outcomes
of collaboration are of course diverse. Some collaborative projects yield products that can be almost immediately commercialized, but such instances are probably few. Other collaborative projects yield useful procedures or algorithms of varying importance to current research. Other collaborative projects yield only negative findings,
and these will not produce any follow-up research.
Such instances are probably few, too, though even
negative information has relevance in deciding
what not to do next. Finally, the context of any
project, the research program of which it is part,
gives companies information about the capabilities and direction of current research. Such strategic guidance is an almost intangible part of
collaboration. Access to students and faculty who
apply this knowledge is more tangible. For some
firms these latter grounds are the main reasons for
participating. The total impact of collaboration is
the sum of the above outcomes.
The application of knowledge obtained through

university R&D

collaboration is a driver of new industrial R&D
programs. These new efforts will increase total
R&D expenditures of firms, except if a reallocation of R&D resources within firms occurs. The
presence of such reallocation, or substitution, in
the aggregate is an open empirical question that is
examined further. However, if decisions about
previous research programs are sound, companies
would incur a competitive
disadvantage
by
eliminating them, and will thus unlikely do so.
Firms of different size and in different industries
may vary somewhat in their responses, but on the
average one would not expect to find substitution
as a consequence of the application of new knowledge in industry. Rather, other factors determine
whether a company or industry can in fact afford
to increase its R&D base. Low industry profits or
a bleak economic outlook are widely rumored to
constrict R&D expenditures. Thus, net of these
other fac~urs, u~versity-indust~
research collaboration is expected to increase total industry
R&D expenditures.
Empirical research dealing with the above propositions is sparse, but generally supportive. A
recent GAO survey, for example, finds that firms
are attracted to collaboration
in ERCs mostly
because of the quality of the university researchers
and the relevance of the research area 1221. Firms
expect to benefit
from collaboration
mostly
through improved in-house research projects and
improvement of current and recruited personnel.
A recent evaluation of the NSF’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Program (IUCRC)
finds that companies belonging to these centers
invest new R&D
funds as the result of their
participation. Companies absorb and use the findings of center projects [8]. It is also relevant to
note that in both studies firms are said not to
expect new products and patents as the result of
their collaboration. These initial findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increased utilization
of academic knowledge through collaboration, and
the role of universities as repositories of knowledge.
3. The determinants

of industry R&D

To the extent that university-industry
collaboration increases innovation, it is only one of
many variables influencing technological innovation.

<-----Page 2----->E.M. Berman / Industty-funded

The theory for hypothesizing
that collaboration
causes innovation
is described above. This study
uses industry-funded
university
R&D
expenditures as a measure of university-industry
collaboration.
These data are annually
reported by
NSF since 1953. Industry-funded
university R&D
expenditures
are direct, research-related
expenditures of universities
paid by industry. The use of
this measure as one of collaboration
is justified
because it covers the major activities of interest:
joint university-industry
research
projects
and
large centers with substantial
industrial
support.
However, this measure does not cover other types
of collaboration,
such as faculty consulting,
expenditures
which are not always reported as research support. Nor does the measure cover fellowships, endowments
and contributions
to capital
funds, nor industry support for university research
channel
led though
non-profit
foundations.
According to the National Science Board, the data
may underestimate
the true amount of industry
support for academic research by a factor of two
[13]. Thus, industry funding of university research
should be regarded as a proxy measure for university-industry
collaboration,
and any negative
findings should be interpreted
with care.
The data on industry-funded
university
R&D
expenditures
are annually
collected by NSF at
universities
across all fields of science. This is
unfortunate
because it disallows any analysis by
field of science. Thus, one is forced to examine the
effect of collaboration
in four to five fields of
academic
science (in which industry
support is
said to be concentrated)
on about four to five
industrial
sectors which account for most R&D
expenditures
[14]. NSF maintains
that reporting
these data by field of science violates principles of
confidentiality
since in some instances it would be
possible, with little additional
information,
to uncover the source of industrial
funding (interview).
NSF’s parallel survey of industrial R&D expenditures also does not include estimates of industry
support of academic research.
The dependent variable is the amount, i.e. level,
of industrial
research effort. This is measured by
industry R&D expenditures.
Increases in research
resources are assumed to lead to increases in the
industrial
research effort, and vice versa. Generally one assumes that increases in R&D expenditures will increase technological
innovation.
Note
that because studies of economic growth also use

university R&D

351

input measures
as explanatory
variables
[3], it
suffices to show that collaboration
leads to increases in technical effort in order to claim that it
also leads to increases in economic growth.
A lengthy research literature
on the determinants of industrial
R&D identifies
three broad
categories:
financial,
structural
and technological

[ill.
Profits are often used in models of industial
R&D expenditure
to indicate liquidity. Liquidity
signifies the availability
of funds for investment,
and R&D is typically considered
an investment.
A second financial
variable
are changes in the
Gross National Product (GNP). This variable signifies the ability of the present economy to afford
new increases in industrial
R&D, as well as a
subjective
assessment
about
future
economic
growth trends [l]. This study examines both financial determinants:
after-tax profits in high-technology industries
and changes in GNP. The definition of high-technology
industries
is based on
NSF [14], and data on corporate profits are obtained from annual July issues of the Survey of
Current Business.
Structural
determinants
are generally defined
as firm size, firm diversification
and industry concentration.
Large firms have economies
of scale
which favor inventive
activity. Diversification
increases the utilization
of results from basic research, and thus stimulates
research.
However,
review studies have found empirical support for
these hypotheses
lacking [3], and it is uncertain
whether these hypotheses
have meaning
at the
aggregate level. Thus, they are not examined
in
this study. Another hypothesis is that foreign competition increases U.S. industrial
R&D expenditures, since U.S. industry
seeks to maintain
or
achieve a lead in technological
innovation.
A measure of foreign technical competition
is the share
of U.S. patents awarded to U.S. firms. This measure is often used as a general indicator of increasing international
rivalry in new technology
[16].
Patent data are collected by the U.S. Department
of Commerce [5].
Technical
variables
are seldom included
in
studies of industrial
R&D, though most authors
acknowledge that technological
advances are likely
to affect current
levels of R&D expenditures.
Patents are sometimes used as a measure of past
R&D productivity,
but there is great concern that
the propensity
to patent has not been constant

<-----Page 3----->over time 131. This study uses three input measures, industrial
basic research expenditures,
industry-funded
university
R&D expenditures
(see
above), and previous industry R&D expenditures.
All three are measures of past technical advances
that may be driving current industrial
R&D effort. The literature on the diffusion of inventions
suggests that some lag should exist between these
variables and subsequent
increases in innovative
activity, because the process of knowledge transfer
and the start-up of new applied research projects
takes time.
Using industrial
basic research as an independent variable implies that the dependent
variable
should be taken as industrial applied research and
development,
i.e. R&D less basic research (even
though AD = 0.95 *R&D).
The model can be
stated as follows:
AD =J(AD,_

i, B-lagged,

PATR,

PROF,

X-lagged,
GNP),

where, AD = Industrial
applied research and development,
B = industrial
basic research,
X =
Industry-funded
university R&D, PRGF = Aftertax profits of ~~-technology
industries,
GNP =
Gross National
Product,
PATR = Ratio of U.S.
patents awarded to foreign versus U.S. residents.
Possible lagged effects of PATR, PROF and
GNP were also examined for up to two years. The
variables
are estimated
in first-difference
form,
that is, as differences
between successive years.
Statistically,
this helps deflect criticism that the
correlations
are spuriously
caused by growth of
the system over time. The variables themselves are
tess likely to be correlated over time. The first-difference form is thus also a more stringent test than
the estimation of variables in annual expenditures
(or “levels”) form. The model is estimated for the
period 1953-1986, in 1982 dollars.

4. Results
What constitutes
statistical
evidence that collaboration
is associated with increases in innovation? First, the relationship
should be statistically
significant in both levels and first-difference
forms.
Results of the latter, the more stringent
test, are
shown below. Second, the effect should be lagged
and should be peaked over time, That is, the effect

should be strongest at some (unknown)
period t,
and less so for lags smaller and greater than t
when the effect has either yet to take place or has
already
taken place. That is, the relationship
should show characteristics
of a bell-shaped
{or
inverted-V shaped) curve.
The size of the data set, 33 observations,
does
not allow for the testing of all possible lagged
relationships.
By first appro~mat~on
the effects of
3X, X in first-difference
form, and aB were examined for lags of three to six years. Based on the
regression results, it was decided that for aB a lag
of two to five years was more appropriate,
and for
3X a lag of three to seven years. For these lags,
both variables
show a nicely inverted
V-shape
pattern:
e.g., the coefficients
of 8X, for f - 3
though f- 7, are: -2.26,
12.00, 69.97, 22.56, and
- 1.85. Subsequent
examination
of other fags further verified the shape of this curve. In the second
step, in order to remove short-term ~uctuations
of
the data, aX and aB are replaced by three-year
moving averages of 8X and aB, denoted as aMB
and aMX. In the third step, variables
that are
statistically
or structurally
insignificant
are
eliminated
in order to have sufficient degrees of
freedom for meaningful
statistical testing. Structurally insignificant
variables are the endpomt values. Variables are eliminated
subject to increasing
the R2-adjusted
statistic, a measure of the model’s
goodness of fit. The final model is then examined
for structural
integrity. The following results are
obtained (t-statistics
in parentheses):
aAD = 10.33**aMB,_,
(3.15)

+ 123.28**aMX,_,
(4.21)

+2.70*aMGNP
(1.77)
* = 10% significance,
where ** = 1% significance,
DW = 1.95,
n = 25 (dfe = 22), SE = 873.03,
@fadj) = 0.85.
Tests for first through fifth order serial correlation were performed,
but only first order serial
correlation
was found. The Cochrane-Qrcutt
procedure was used to correct for this serial correlation of the error term. It is found that both aMB
and aMX are significant
at better than the 1
percent level. Thus, there is statistical evidence of
a lagged association
between industry-funded
university R&D and subsequent
industrial
applied

<-----Page 4----->E. M. Berman / Industry-funded university R&D

research and development.
The lag is five years.
Current economic
activity (GNP) is also a determinant
of industry R&D expenditures
at the
10 percent level of significance.
It is noted that ZlPATR (a measure of foreign
technical
competition),
aPROF
(profits),
and
aAD, _ 1 are statistically insignificant
and have been
dropped from the model. None of these variables,
lagged and/or averaged, affects the significance of
aX or aB. The nonsignificance
of aPATR corroborates the widely held belief that in the past U.S.
industry
has failed to respond
to increases
in
technical advances from abroad.
The positive association
of i3X with aAD suggests a complementary
rather than substitutive
relationship
between university-industry
research
collaboration
and industry
R&D. Collaboration
increases
innovation.
If, in the aggregate,
collaboration
causes a reallocation
of industry
research expenditures,
then no correlation
would
have been found. If collaboration
is a substitute
for industry R&D expenditures,
then a negative
relationship
would have been found. Since a positive relationship
is found, a complementary
relationship exists.
The hypotheses were also examined
that university-industry
research
collaboration
is only
weakly associated with federally-funded
industry
R&D because decisions by the federal government to fund industrial
R&D (in defense and
health) are based on political rather than investment-based variables included in the model above.
By contrast, university-industry
collaboration
is
hypothesized
to be a determinant
of industryfunded industry
R&D. These hypotheses
were
tested using the same procedures described above,
but with these new dependent
variables.
Collaboration
is found not to be significantly
related
to federally-funded
industry R&D expenditures,
yet significantly
related to industry-funded
industry R&D expenditure.
These estimations
provide a further check on the validity of the model.
Finally, several rival hypotheses were also examined. Total university R&D expenditures
were
examined as a possible determinant
of industryfunded university R&D. Though the uses of general academic knowledge
are unpredictable
with
regard to industrial
applications,
increases in university R&D could increase such uses by total
volume, however unpredictable
per unit. But general university R&D expenditures
were not found

353

to be a determinant.
The impact of R&D expenditures
of non-profit
organizations
other than
universities
on innovation
were also examined.
Such organizations
include Battelle Memorial and
other well-known
research
organizations.
However, these expenditures
were not found to be
significant
either. Finally,
lags of industrial
applied research and development
beyond one year
were also not significant.

5. Discussion
This research finds tentative evidence that university-industry
research collaboration
is a key to
economic competitiveness.
The current trend towards increasing university-industry
research collaboration
may have large effects on the level of
total and industry-funded
industry R&D expenditures in coming years.
This research also finds that the effect of collaboration
on industry research is lagged by about
five years. While long, this lag is still shorter than
other studies have shown for the use of undirected
academic science, which results in a lag of about
12 years [7,10]. Thus, it can be argued that collaboration
not only increases future industrial
research, but also that it speeds up the transfer and
utilization
of academic research in industry.
As
discussed
above, the transfer and utilization
of
academic research involves many interactions
with
industry, such as joint projects, the hiring of students, faculty consulting,
and so on.
These findings help justify policy that aims to
increase
industry-university
research
collaboration in order to stimulate technological
innovation
in industry.
However, these findings do not detract from a concern raised by others about the
need to balance industrial
influences on academic
research with the values of traditional
academic
freedom [6,9,19]. For example, it is said that too
much industry
influence
on academic
research
could undermine
future pay-offs from undirected
academic research. This study informs that debate
by presenting
evidence
of the pay-offs of collaborative
research. Another consideration
based
on Peters [17], is that this debate about priorities
should deal with the impact of collaboration
in
specific fields of science, rather than with the
implications
of collaboration
for the university

<-----Page 5----->354

research system as a whole. This is because industry-university
research collaboration
is concentrated in four or five fields of science: in many
fields collaboration
is largely absent.
Because this study does not examine the determinants
of collaboration,
no specific recommendations
are provided for enhancing
collaboration. However, two general insights are implied by
the lag between collaboration
and industry
research. This lag is very long by political
and
program standards.
First, the economic impact of
collaborative
research occurs well beyond the next
election.
Thus, congressional
support
for collaboration
is sought on a procurement
or geographic basis, rather than with concern for nationally relevant, tangible accomplishments.
Second,
programs
will continue
to be designed
around
input measures and assessment,
such as peer review. This is because outcome indicators are relevant well after the fact.
This lag also has implications
for further research, because it suggests that it will be difficult
to document
the outcome
of the utilization
of
academic knowledge by industry. Not only does
the utilized academic knowledge
undergo many
transformations
during the five year period, but
the scientists responsible
for the initial utilization
of academic
knowledge
will quite likely have
moved on to new projects or even companies.
An
important
consequence
is that survey-based
research could yield the erroneous
finding in the
coming years that the actual outcome of the new
collaborative
programs is “little or no effect” on
innovation.
This could be a problem because many
program evaluations
are based on the results of
survey research.
Finally, while for want of data it is not possible
to disaggregate this analysis by industry or field of
science, it is of interest to know whether this U.S.
experience is replicated
abroad. The methods of
this study are easily applied
to data of other
countries, to the extent that these data exist.
