IMPACT OF AGENCY RISKS AND TASK UNCERTAINTY
ON VENTURE CAPITALIST-CEO INTERACTION
HARRY J. SAPIENZA
University of South Carolina
ANIL K. GUPTA
University of Maryland
This study examined the impact of agency risks and task uncertainty on
venture capitalist-chief executive officer (VC-CEO)interaction. Results
from 51 VC-CEO dyads indicate that the frequency of interaction depends on the extent of VC-CEO goal congruence, the degree of the CEO's
new venture experience, the venture's stage of development, and the
degree of technical innovation it is pursuing. However, contrary to conventional expectations, the degree of management ownership had no
impact on the frequency of interaction.

Aimed at extending governance research beyond a simple focus on the
motivation of managers to expend requisite effort in their role as owners'
agents (Berle & Means, 1932; Fama &Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976),
this study examined a behavioral aspect of owner-management interaction
in the context of venture capitalist-chief executive officer (VC-CEO) dyads.1
Venture capital-backed firms tend to have concentrated ownership structures,2 high task and outcome uncertainty, and a weak market for external
control; thus, the venture capital setting is a particularly fruitful arena for
studying the response of investors to governance challenges posed by a
business context in which the primary risks emanate from sources other than
divergence between the financial interests of principals and agents. Specifically, this study focused on the governance implications of (1) differences
between backers (principals) and managers (agents) regarding the direction
of the agents' efforts, (2) the agents' ability (Walsh & Seward, 1990), and (3)

1 A venture
capital firm is typically organized as a general partnership functioning as an
intermediary between investors (limited partners) and newly created ventures (Morris, 1991).
Such firms' financing of a venture can commence at a very early idea stage or years later, in the
form of refinancing for expansion. Venture capital firms typically exit the relationship when the
venture stock is sold in the public market or is acquired by an existing corporation (Pratt, 1987).
2 Jensen (1989) reported that the median equity held by corporate CEOs in large public
firms is about 0.25 percent, and it is about 6.4 percent in the case of LBOs. No comparable
figures are available on VC-backed ventures, but in our data the median shares for a CEO and
a top management team were 13 and 37.5 percent, respectively.

difference between the
very high levels of inherent task uncertainty-the
information required to perform a task and the information already possessed (Galbraith, 1973: 5)-which
create a need for joint decision making
the
and
by
principals
agents.
A focus on the governance of new ventures is of practical importance as
well as theoretical interest. Although the vast majority of U.S. start-ups
occur without venture capital financing, such financing is almost essential
for high-risk ventures with long-term payback that are not amenable to
"bootstrap financing" (Bhide, 1992). Aside from the fact that venture capital
firms currently invest about $3 billion in the U.S. economy each year (Southerland, 1993), studies by the U.S. General Accounting Office and by scholars
have shown that venture capital-firm backed ventures are responsible for a
significantly larger-than-proportionate share of growth in jobs and wealth,
especially in the high-technology sectors of the economy (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Further, researchers have depicted venture capital firms' role
in innovation and economic development as pivotal to the development of
new industries (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Thus, the effective functioning
of the venture capital industry is of direct practical importance to investors,
actual or potential entrepreneurs, and public policy makers.
With the above considerations in mind, we focused on the following
research question: Is the frequency of interaction between venture capitalists
and new ventures' CEOs a function of differences in agency risks and task
uncertainty associated with differences in these ventures' contexts? In pursuing this question, we built on the pioneering work of Barney, Busenitz,
Fiet, and Moesel (1989), who found that high agency and business risks were
associated with the more elaborate governance structures employed by venture capital firms to control and monitor venture managers. However, in the
present study we attempted to go beyond Barney and colleagues' work in
four ways: (1) In their examination of the sources of agency risks, those
authors focused only on the risks associated with the magnitude of managerial efforts and looked at the governance impact of variables such as the
tenure of a venture's CEO, the percentage of the CEO's personal wealth at
stake in the venture, and the percentage of the venture's equity held by
employees; in contrast, we also focused on the risks associated with both the
direction of CEOs' efforts and their capability. (2) Barney and colleagues
measured business risk as a proxy variable for a venture's profitability in the
year that it received its first round of venture capital; in contrast, we focused
on two direct sources of business risk: a venture's stage of development and
the extent of technical innovation it was pursuing. (3) In looking at the
governance response of venture capitalists, Barney and colleagues focused
on structural mechanisms, such as a venture's ownership and the composition of its board of directors; in contrast, we focused on a process variable,
the frequency of interaction between venture capitalist and CEO. Finally, (4)
Barney and colleagues collected data from management only; in contrast, we
used data from matched pairs of lead VCs and venture CEOs.

THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Our basic theoretical premise was that the frequency of VC-CEO interaction will be greater when high agency risks necessitate greater monitoring
by the VC (Fama &Jensen, 1983) and high task uncertainty necessitates more
joint decision making and thereby greater investment in informationprocessing capacity for both parties (Galbraith, 1973). Building on this premise, we developed hypotheses dealing with the impact of five factorsmanagerial ownership, goal congruence in VC-CEO pairs, the level of a
CEO's new venture experience, a venture's stage of development, and the
extent of technical innovation it was pursuing-on the frequency of VC-CEO
interaction. In testing these hypotheses empirically, we also controlled for
the potential confounding effects of several other variables: a venture's performance, the openness of the VC-CEO relationship, venture size, the distance between the offices of the VC and the CEO, and the percentage of the
venture's directors who were VCs.
Agency Risks and the Frequency of VC-CEO Interaction
Agency theorists (e.g., Eisenhardt, 1989; Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen &
Meckling, 1976) have consistently suggested that the agency problem is
quite general. For example, as Jensen and Meckling stated:
The problem of inducing an "agent" to behave as if he were
maximizing the "principal's"welfare is quite general.It exists in
all organizationsand in all cooperative efforts-at every level of
management in firms, in universities, in mutual companies, in
cooperatives, in governmental authorities and bureaus, in
unions, and in relationships normally classified as agency relationships such as are common in the performing arts and the
market for real estate (1976: 309).
Despite these claims regarding the generality of agency theory, research
on this subject has focused predominantly on the context of investor control
over the managers of large, publicly held corporations (Eisenhardt, 1989).
Since such corporations are characterized by dispersed outside ownership
coupled with almost no managerial ownership, the extant literature has been
concerned largely with agency problems rooted in motivational causes such
as deliberate effort shirking and other types of opportunism. Given this
focus, it is not surprising that authors have also assumed that agency problems largely vanish once the interests of principals and agents have been
aligned. Walsh and Seward (1990) began to extend agency theory when they
suggested that agency problems arise not just from suboptimal effort but also
from lack of agent ability; this extension has yet to be subjected to empirical
tests. In this article, we added yet another potential basis for agency problems: disagreements between a principal and an agent over the direction of
the agent's efforts.
Agency theory suggests several reasons why venture capitalists will see

<-----Page 4----->1994

managers who own small shares of their firms as posing greater agency risks
than those holding larger shares. First, when a new venture is wholly owned
by its managers, they bear all costs of consuming perquisites; however, after
they have sold a portion of their ownership, they bear only a fraction of the
direct costs of their actions (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Second, reductions in
ownership may reduce managerial incentive to work toward long-term profit
rather than short-term gain (Berle & Means, 1932). Third, as managers' ownership share dwindles, the security of their positions diminishes, creating a
greater incentive to "tamper with the board's ability to monitor and control
performance" (Walsh & Seward, 1990: 431). These arguments are supported
in the new venture context by Barney and colleagues' (1989) finding that low
employee ownership was associated with greater investment in structural
governance mechanisms on the part of venture capital firms.
It is our position that even if there were no question about managers'
willingness to expend effort to maximize profits, the issue of the direction of
effort would still exist. In contexts such as new ventures, in which task
uncertainty is very high, signals regarding the most appropriate course of
action are generally very weak. In such a situation, even if a principal and an
agent are equally committed to the maximization of shareholder wealth, they
might have recurring disagreements regarding how to prioritize operating
goals. From the VC's perspective, an agency problem arises because such
disagreements raise the question of whether the CEO is pursuing the best
course of action. Our argument is not that, in any situation involving disagreements over the direction of effort, the VC's perspective will be superior
to that of the managers of a venture. Rather, we argue that, as long as both the
VC and the CEO have major financial stakes in the venture and as long as
there exists a possibility that neither side will always be right or always be
wrong, disagreements over the direction of effort will create agency problems for the venture capitalist.
Another risk VCs face concerns the managerial ability of venture CEOs.
It is well documented that venture capital firms expend considerable resources prior to investment on ensuring the quality and competence of ventures' CEOs and managerial teams (Hisrich & Jankowicz, 1990; Rock, 1987).
However, no amount of due diligence can completely eliminate the risk that
managerial ability will prove to be insufficient for the task at hand. Evidence
that VCs continue to perceive such risks can be seen in, for example, Ruhnka
and Young's (1987) finding that managerial competence is among the greatest of VCs' concerns. Managerial ability is especially salient in the new
venture environment because a venture's CEO will often be a founder who
possesses some unique, often technical, capabilities critical for the success
of a venture (Rock, 1987) but has had little managerial experience.3 Our
expectation is that when ventures' CEOs have had little prior experience
launching and building new ventures, venture capitalists will have greater
3 In the ventures
studied, 68 percent of the CEOs had never before founded or co-founded
a venture. Of this subgroup, fully 74 percent had never even worked for a new firm previously.

uncertainty about their managerial acumen and will therefore expend
greater effort monitoring their decisions. Thus,
Hypothesis 1: The lower the level of management's ownership of a venture, the greater will be the frequency of
VC-CEO interaction.
Hypothesis 2: The lower the congruence between the
goals of a lead investor and a venture's CEO, the greater
will be the frequency of VC-CEO interaction.
Hypothesis 3: The lower the level of a CEO's new venture
experience, the greater will be the frequency of VC-CEO
interaction.
Task Uncertainty and the Frequency of VC-CEO Interaction
Eisenhardt (1989) suggested that agency theory should be used in conjunction with complementary theories in examining governance issues.
of task uncerGiven that generally high-but nonetheless varying-levels
tainty characterize new ventures, the information-processing perspective
from organization theory (Galbraith, 1973; Gupta, 1987) also sheds useful
light on the governance of new ventures. As noted, following Galbraith
(1973: 5), we defined task uncertainty as the difference between the information required to perform a task and the information already possessed.
Our argument is that as the task uncertainty facing the managers of a venture
increases, the information-processing capacity of the VC-CEO decisionmaking unit must increase to facilitate joint decision making. We suggest
that the magnitude of task uncertainty will be a function of the stage of a
venture's development and the degree of innovation it is pursuing.
Researchers have long suggested that the younger a business is, the more
tenuous it is. Many studies have supported Stinchcombe's (1965) proposition regarding the liability of newness (Bruderl & Schussler, 1990). Some key
reasons early-stage ventures tend to be riskier than late-stage ventures are
greater unresolved demand uncertainties, greater unresolved technological
uncertainties in both product and process design, greater unresolved resource uncertainties in areas such as availability of skilled employees, raw
materials, and channels of distribution, and greater unresolved management
uncertainties in areas such as the leadership capabilities of the founder and
compatibility and balance within the top management team.
Similarly, Zaltman, Duncan, and Holbeck (1973) suggested that high
levels of innovation produce high levels of uncertainty within and between
decision makers. Those authors argued that innovating decision makers face
three types of uncertainty: (1) technical uncertainty, concerning whether an
innovation is technically feasible; (2) novelty, uncertainty as to whether the
innovation has been or is being developed by competitors; and (3) marketing
uncertainty, concerning whether the innovation will be accepted in the marketplace. Innovating ventures must discover what innovations to pursue,
how to pursue them, whether the pursuit is likely to be profitable, and

<-----Page 6----->1994

1623

whether or not they can sustain their advantage in the face of competitors'
attempts at imitation (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982; Rumelt, 1987). Thus, in
highly innovative ventures, VC-CEO dyads are apt to require very high levels
of information exchange to cope with the strategic and administrative burdens fostered by high uncertainty.
In sum, following Galbraith (1973) and Gupta (1987), we have argued
that greater task uncertainties would lead to greater information exchange in
VC-CEO dyads. Specifically, we have argued that early-stage ventures and
ventures pursuing high innovation would likely face greater task uncertainties due to unresolved internal and external demands. Thus, we advance the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 4: The earlier the stage of a venture's development, the greater will be the frequency of VC-CEO interaction.
Hypothesis 5: The higher the level of innovation being
pursued by a venture, the greater will be the intensity of
VC-CEO interaction.
METHODS
Treating the VC-CEO dyad as the unit of analysis, we accomplished data
collection in four phases. In the first phase, we conducted open-ended interviews with ten VCs and ten venture CEOs and also pretested an early
version of our survey instrument with those individuals. In the second
phase, we contacted 40 general partners of venture capital firms and conducted face-to-face structured interviews with 32 of them; these interviews
lasted an average 75 minutes. We also used the interviews to explain the
purpose of the study, to refine the research instrument, and to request the
general partners' participation in the next phase of the study. Resource constraints limited our selection of venture capital firms to those located on the
East Coast, one of the two primary centers of venture capital activity in the
United States (Morris, 1991).
In the third phase, we asked each of the 32 VCs to complete a separate
questionnaire for each of two or more ventures in which their firms were
currently the lead investors and, if possible, to include both ventures performing well and those performing less well. In total, VCs completed questionnaires on 65 portfolio companies. Of these questionnaires, 5 were considered unusable because the VCs did not identify the focal ventures. In the
fourth phase, we sent surveys paralleling the ones completed by the VCs to
the CEOs of the 60 remaining ventures, from whom we received 51 usable
surveys. Thus, the data for this study come from surveys of 51 matched
VC-CEO pairs. We conducted follow-up interviews with 18 of the CEOs to
gain further insights into the data.
The size of the venture capital firms studied ranged from $5 million to
$500 million in capital under management, with a median of $49 million.
The portfolio companies were geographically dispersed across the United

<-----Page 7----->1624

States, ranged in sales revenues from zero to $88 million (median = $5
million), and competed in a wide range of industries, predominantly hightechnology industries such as biotechnology and computers. The median
age of the ventures was four years, and the median age of the CEOs was 43
years. Because response rates were high, no tests for nonresponse bias were
considered necessary.
Criterion and Predictor Variables
Frequency of VC-CEO interaction. Matched responses from both a VC
and a CEO were used to measure the frequency of their interaction. Using a
seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1, "every day," to 7, "less than
once a quarter," we asked each member of the dyad to indicate the frequency
of his or her interaction with the other member face to face, by telephone,
and through writing. For all three modes of interaction, the responses by the
two sides had significant and positive correlations (p < .001, p < .001, and
p < .01, respectively). Thus, the six responses were reverse-coded and combined to yield a composite measure of the frequency of VC-CEO interaction
(oc = .86). To further check validity, we compared the frequency of interaction with the VCs' responses to a question regarding the number of hours
devoted to the ventures over the previous year and found a positive, significant correlation (r = .68, p < .001).
Management ownership level. CEOs provided data on venture ownership. Management's ownership level was the sum of the percentages of a
venture's ownership held by the CEO and all other managers.
Goal congruence. Congruence in goals was measured via the responses
of the VC and the CEO on the relative importance of 15 objectives: 6 were
financial (sales growth rate, market share, cash flow, gross margin, return on
investment, and market valuation) and 9 were nonfinancial (new product
development, process development, basic research, market development,
operating efficiency, personnel development, company stability, establishment of an entrepreneurial culture, and readiness for public sale). Respondents allocated 100 points across the financial criteria to indicate each one's
importance to the achievement of short-term financial goals; similarly, they
allocated 100 points across the nonfinancial criteria. Finally, using 100
points, they also indicated the percentages of emphasis they believed should
be given to financial goals and nonfinancial goals. We multiplied these percentages times the point allocations to derive a weighted score for each
criterion. For each VC-CEO dyad, the sum of the absolute differences in the
two ratings yielded a composite measure of goal differences for the dyad. We
multiplied this variable by -1 to obtain a measure of VC-CEO goal congruence in which high values indicate greater agreement.
CEO's new venture experience. CEOs provided information on their
new venture experience by indicating whether they had had no prior new
venture experience (coded 1), worked in start-ups before but not founded
one (coded 2), or previously founded or co-founded a venture (coded 3).
Financing stage of the venture. The vocabulary used in Pratt's Guide to

<-----Page 8----->1994

Venture Capital Sources to identify venture stage is familiar to most VCs
(Ruhnka & Young, 1987). Therefore, we asked VCs to identify each venture's
financing stage using the following scale: 1, seed financing; 2, start-up; 3,
first stage; 4, restart-up; 5, expansion; and 6, bridge-acquisition. This measure correlates as expected with other measures of venture development
provided by the CEOs: number of employees (r = .58, p < .001), time since
founding (r = .41, p < .01), time since initial venture capital investment (r
= .40, p < .01), and sales revenue (r = .27, p < .05).
Technical innovation. As Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1990) argued,
CEOs possess a more intimate knowledge of the level and sophistication of
their own and their competitors' technologies than do outsiders; therefore,
we obtained data on the levels of the ventures' technical innovation from the
CEOs only. Using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1, "to no degree," to 5, "to a great degree," CEOs rated the extent to which they were
attempting innovation relative to competitors in terms of product design and
process technology. Similarly, using a five-point scale from 1, "significantly
lower," to 5, "significantly higher," they rated their positions relative to
competitors' in terms of R&Dspending and process technology. We averaged
responses to these four items ((x = .70).
Control Variables
In order to focus on variations in VC-CEO relations resulting solely from
agency risk and task uncertainty, we controlled for other factors that might
affect the frequency of VC-CEO interaction.
Venture performance. Barney and colleagues (1989) found that a venture's profitability in the year of its initial venture funding affected the
structural governance mechanisms its backer employed. Because venture
performance might affect VC propensity to monitor CEO behavior, we controlled for current performance in our analysis.
Because many ventures in the study still had zero sales revenue, growth
in sales and accounting measures of profitability were inappropriate proxies
for performance. Both Dess and Robinson (1984) and Brush and Vanderwerf
(1992) have found CEOs' subjective assessments of their firms' performance
to be reliable and valid proxies in the absence of objective measures. However, in order to minimize the risks of self-report bias, we obtained data on
the ventures' performance not only from their CEOs but also from their
venture capitalists. Both members of a dyad rated the importance of the 15
criteria described above in the context of the goal congruence variable. Then,
for each of the 15 dimensions, they were asked to indicate their level of
satisfaction with the venture's performance on a five-point Likert scale (1 =
not at all satisfied, 5 = extremely satisfied). Using these data, we created two
weighted-average, multicriterion measures of performance for each venture,
one based on the perceptions of each party. Additionally, we asked both
members to provide their overall ratings of the venture's performance on the
same scale. Combining and averaging the multicriterion measures with the

<-----Page 9----->1626

December

overall performance measure resulted in a highly reliable multiitem, multirater measure of venture performance (ca = .87).4
Openness of interaction. The extent to which personal, informal relations exist in VC-CEO pairs may affect efforts to monitor or improve information-processing capacity. Using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 1, "strongly agree," to 5, "strongly disagree," both members of the
VC-CEO dyad indicated the extent to which they (1) were "very friendly"
with one another and (2) engaged in "frequent social interaction" with one
another. The reverse-coded responses were averaged (a = .61).
Venture size. Because large ventures will have a greater impact on the
overall performance of venture capital firms, the frequency of VC-CEO interaction may be higher for large ventures. Venture size was measured as
number of employees from data provided by the CEOs.
Geographic distance. Time, travel, and communication costs created by
geographic distance may affect the propensity of VCs to monitor ventures.
Distance was measured as the number of minutes it would take a venture
capitalist to travel to a venture; these data were provided by the VCs.
Percentage of VCs on board of directors. The percentage of a venture's
board of directors composed of VCs may affect the monitoring burden. The
CEOs provided data.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for and zero-order correlations
among all the variables.
Additional Tests for Validity
Our use of different sources for the most sensitive data in the study
helped to reduce problems associated with self-report data. However, because each VC was asked to fill out two or more surveys, we chose not to ask
VCs to answer all the questions posed to CEOs. Therefore, we used an analytic method suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986: 536) to examine the
extent to which common method variance undermined the validity of our
data. We examined the factor structure of the six key variables (the criterion
and predictor variables). If a single factor largely explained the variance in
the data, the threat of common method variance would be high. For our data,
three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 emerged; further, the first
factor explained only 31 percent of the variance. Thus, common method
variance did not appear to be a significant problem. It might also be noted
4 We took several steps to check the validity of our performance measure. Because growth
is a key objective of VC-backed ventures (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992), the significant and positive correlation between our subjective measure and an objective measure of the rate of employee growth from founding to the time of the study provided evidence of convergent validity.
Post-study data collection also showed a significant, positive correlation between our measure
and growth, evidence of the measure's predictive validity. Further, the mean performance
ratings for ventures that had gone public since the study were significantly higher than those of
others. In additional analyses, substitution of the objective growth measures does not change
the results.

that, in designing the surveys, we followed a procedure suggested by Salancik and Pfeffer (1977) and designed to reduce the danger of consistency bias
by placing items concerning the dependent variable before those for the
independent variables.
Analysis
Hypotheses were tested by regressing the frequency of interaction
against the five predictor variables and the five control variables. We standardized all variables prior to carrying out the regression analyses. Table 2
presents results of the tests of the hypotheses.
RESULTS
Impact of Agency Risks
Hypothesis 1, which predicts that the frequency of VC-CEO interaction
will be higher in ventures in which levels of management ownership are
low, is not supported. Hypothesis 2, predicting that VC-CEO interaction will
be more frequent in ventures with low VC-CEO goal congruence, is supported. The results also support Hypothesis 3, which predicts that the frequency of interaction will be negatively related to a CEO's amount of start-up
experience.

Impact of Task Uncertainty
Hypothesis 4, which predicts that the frequency of interaction will be
greater in VC-CEO pairs engaged in early-stage ventures, is supported. Finally, weak support exists for Hypothesis 5, which predicts that the frequency of interaction will be greater when technical innovation is high.
Table 2 indicates no impact for three of the control variables, performance, openness of VC-CEO relations, and venture size. However, the
smaller the physical distance between a VC and a venture and the higher the
percentage of VCs on a board of directors, the more frequent the interaction
between a VC and a CEO.
In summary, support exists for both theoretical perspectives examined:
both agency risks and task uncertainty appear to influence venture capitalists' governance of new ventures.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to extend investigation of firm governance to
the venture capital setting. In doing so, we departed from previous empirical
research on governance issues in at least two important ways: (1) Unlike
previous authors, who have focused on structural responses to governance
challenges, we focused on a process variable: the frequency of interaction
between a VC and a venture's CEO. (2) We focused on the governance challenges emanating from both divergence in the financial interests of principals and agents and other factors.
The results clearly reinforce recent suggestions by Pettigrew (1992) that
future research should focus on process responses to governance challenges
as well as on structural responses. This study indicates that process responses do indeed supplement structural mechanisms, which are often
crude, hard-to-adjust devices (Walsh & Seward, 1990). In new ventures, such
process responses may be particularly salient because a high level of management ownership may render tinkering with incentive mechanisms ineffectual and the idiosyncratic knowledge possessed by the ventures' founders
and other top managers may be virtually irreplaceable. The strength of our
results also holds out the possibility that investigations into other process
responses may be productive.
The results also support the need to look at governance challenges
posed by factors other than separation of ownership and control. Several
plausible explanations exist for the observed nonsignificant impact of ownership on the frequency of VC-CEO interaction. One explanation could be
that agency risk is less strongly related to degree of ownership than it is to
the proportion of a manager's income derived from a firm (Hambrick &
Mason, 1984). A second explanation is that there could be a threshold effect-that above a certain level of ownership, there is little or no reason to
expect incentive-related shirking or opportunism. This latter explanation
reinforces our ex ante speculation that the concentration of ownership in the

investor and management groups in the venture capital setting makes it a
particularly fruitful arena for examining agency risks other than shirking.
This study also adds to academic understanding of how venture capital
firms respond to governance challenges posed by agency risks and task uncertainty. Consistent with Barney and colleagues' (1989) findings regarding
structural responses, our data indicate that VCs' behavioral response under
conditions of high risk and uncertainty is to increase their interaction with
the CEOs of their portfolio companies. Together with our earlier finding
(Gupta & Sapienza, 1992) that venture capitalists pursue less industry and
geographic diversification when investment risk is high, these results suggest that they manage risk through monitoring and involvement rather than
through diversification. The practical implication of this conclusion is that
there may well be fundamental limits on the extent to which venture capital
firms can effectively invest in diverse ventures and industries. Our results
provide information on when VCs are likely to seek greater interaction; this
information builds on growing information on how VCs interact with new
ventures (Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Sapienza, 1989, 1992) and may be of
practical value to entrepreneurs by enhancing their understanding of investors' motives and thus allowing them to anticipate periods of high and low
interaction.
Finally, an additional difference between this work and much of the
past related research is that some of the agency problems identified here may
be considered perceived risks. This study shows that low goal congruence,
early stage-of-venture development, and high levels of innovation may increase the frequency of VC-CEO interaction. Do these conditions actually
represent higher agency risk, or do they merely influence venture capitalists'
assessment of the potential for loss? Although this study cannot answer that
question, our results suggest that perceptions of agency risk significantly
affect behaviors meant to cope with agency risk.
The following appear to be productive directions for future research:
Examinations of (1) other contextual determinants of VC-CEO interaction
such as negotiation processes, personal demographic characteristics, and the
state of the public offering market; (2) the impact of VC-CEO interaction on
outcomes such as the content of venture strategies, future venture performance, CEO job satisfaction, CEO succession, the rate of venture development, and the choice of exit vehicle; (3) governance challenges in contexts
such as leveraged buyouts, which are very similar to start-up ventures in
terms of concentrated ownership but very dissimilar in terms of stage of
development; (4) how governance through interaction compares with other
structural governance devices; and (5) investor-investor relations, between
limited partners and general partners, for example, and their impact on the
governance of private and public companies.
Future research would also benefit from identifying and avoiding some
of the major limitations of the present study, the most obvious of which is
our reliance on cross-sectional data. Although causality is implied in the
theoretical discussion of the hypotheses, the temporal homogeneity of the

<-----Page 14----->1994

data prevented tests for such causality. Longitudinal studies designed to test
the specific causal links our framework suggests would help to address this
problem. Equally important, although in this study we took several steps to
mitigate the risks of self-report bias, future work would benefit from the use
of more objective indicators wherever possible.
