a b s t r a c t
Effective human capital formation through the medium of entrepreneurship education and
training (EET) is of increasing concern for governments, as EET is growing rapidly across the
world. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consistent evidence showing that EET helps to create
more or better entrepreneurs. We undertake the first quantitative review of the literature and,
in the context of human capital theory, find that there is indeed support for the value of EET.
Based on 42 independent samples (N = 16,657), we find a significant relationship between EET
and entrepreneurship-related human capital assets (rw = .217) and entrepreneurship outcomes
(rw = .159). The relationship between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes is stronger for
academic-focused EET interventions (rw = .238) than for training-focused EET interventions
(rw = .151). We find evidence of heterogeneity in many of our correlations, and recommend that
future studies examine potential moderators to more clearly delineate EET effect sizes. We also
find a number of methodological weaknesses among the studies analyzed and that those studies
with lower methodological rigor are overstating the effect of EET. Recommendations to improve
the quality of future work in the field are provided.

1. Executive summary
Entrepreneurship education and training (EET) is growing rapidly in universities and colleges throughout the world, and
governments are supporting it both directly and through funding major investments in advice-provision to would-be
entrepreneurs and existing small businesses. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to show that EET helps to create more or
better entrepreneurs. Studies in the extant literature have demonstrated both positive and negative outcomes of EET, and
qualitative reviews have not adequately addressed these equivocal results. In this paper, we present the first quantitative review
of the literature and find that there is indeed support for the value of EET.
Our paper is grounded primarily in human capital theory, which predicts that individuals or groups who possess greater levels
of knowledge, skills, and other competencies will achieve greater performance outcomes. Entrepreneurship researchers have
studied the relationship between human capital and entrepreneurial outcomes at various levels of analysis and results have been
generally supportive of the theory. However, there are gaps in the literature. First, recent work in the field points to a need to
investigate the links between entrepreneurship-specific education and both the human capital assets it creates and the
entrepreneurial outcomes to which it purportedly leads. Second, most conceptualizations of the relationship between human
capital and its outcomes have been static in nature, but recent research suggests there may be value in investigating the dynamics
of human capital.

We addressed these gaps by conducting the first meta-analytic review of the outcomes of EET. A major advantage of
conducting a meta-analysis over a narrative review is that it controls for sampling error. Sampling error is random and nonsystematic, and, as such, under- and overestimations of population values are equally likely. Our search for primary data included
searches of electronic databases in the areas of general business and management education, searching references from published
articles, requesting both published and unpublished manuscripts on a variety of electronic listservs, and other methods. The
search for primary data yielded a final total of 42 independent studies (N = 16,657).
Our results indicated a significant positive relationship between EET and entrepreneurship-related human capital assets
(rw = .217) and entrepreneurial performance (rw = .159). Moderator analyses indicated that the relationship between EET and
entrepreneurship outcomes was stronger for academic-focused EET interventions (rw = .238) than for training-focused EET
interventions (rw = .151).
Our results have two important practical implications. First, the positive relationships between EET and both entrepreneurshiprelated human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes should represent good news for governments, universities and
colleges, and private organizations that have invested heavily in the development of EET programs over the past several decades.
Although more and higher quality data are needed to make strong claims, our findings suggest that those resources are having some
positive impact in increasing interest and attitudes toward entrepreneurship among students who attend such courses, and in
improving their financial performance as entrepreneurs. Thus public policy and education decision-makers can have more
confidence when making future funding decisions related to entrepreneurship-related education and training. Second, our findings
on the relative strengths of the two main types of EET – training-focused versus academic-focused – suggests that training-focused
programs may benefit from the introduction of more conceptual material, which may help students achieve financial success and
maintain a business over an extended period of time.
We found indications of homogeneity in the correlations for academic-focused EET and for training-focused EET, suggesting
that it is unlikely that moderators are significantly affecting these results. This was not the case for all of our other analyses, where
we found strong indications of heterogeneity in our correlations, suggesting that there are moderators, which might help to better
explain the relationships. Future research should explore these moderators, examples of which we identify.
Unfortunately, the EET literature includes many studies that do not meet a high standard of rigor, and there is no clear
indication of a trend toward increased methodological rigor at this time. Further, our results suggest that the lower rigor studies
tend to overestimate the impact of EET. Many studies do not incorporate both pre- and post-EET intervention measures and
treatment and control group comparisons. To improve the value of the EET literature in the future, studies should be designed to
include both of these elements (ideally at several points in time post-intervention). Such methodological rigor will greatly
improve the ability of researchers to make accurate claims about the impact of EET on entrepreneurship related outcomes.

2. Introduction
Entrepreneurship education and training (EET) is growing rapidly in universities and colleges throughout the world (Katz,
2003; Kuratko, 2005) and governments are supporting it directly and indirectly through funding major investments to would-be
entrepreneurs and existing small businesses. This trend is fuelled by a recognition that entrepreneurship can play an important
(even critical) role in economic growth and employment (Schumpeter, 1934; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; Kuratko, 2005),
and assertions that entrepreneurship education can play a vital role in developing more and/or more able entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Gorman et al., 1997; Katz, 2007; Pittaway and Cope, 2007). Unfortunately, as several scholars have noted (e.g., Weaver et al.,
2006; Peterman and Kennedy, 2003), there is little consistent evidence to support these claims.
This study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by providing the first meta-analytic review of extant EET studies
linking EET-specific interventions with entrepreneurship outcomes. Our analysis is grounded in human capital theory (Becker,
1964; Mincer, 1958), as it is well suited to the examination of educational outcomes. The use of human capital theory to explain
aspects of entrepreneurial success is also well established in the entrepreneurship literature (e.g. Pfeffer, 1994), but almost
exclusively as a static model where accumulated education and experience is related to various forms of success (e.g. Chandler
and Hanks, 1998; Rauch et al., 2005; Cassar, 2006; Dyke et al., 1992; van der Sluis et al., 2005). In their recent meta-analysis,
Unger et al. (2011) make the case for why human capital theory must be considered in less static terms, at least as it relates to the
field of entrepreneurship:
Given the dynamics in entrepreneurship and the constant need to learn and to adapt, it may prove useful to look beyond
the static concept of human capital and to examine outcomes of actual learning activities… (p. 3)
Our work also addresses the need for a more dynamic depiction of human capital in the entrepreneurship field, by examining
the outcomes of educational activities that are specific to entrepreneurship. This dynamic view of human capital for the
entrepreneurship field examines the relationships between human capital investments, which are inputs, such as the time and
money spent taking a course in entrepreneurship; human capital assets, which represent the capability that may be garnered from
the investments, such as knowledge and skills; and entrepreneurship outcomes, such as starting or growing a new business. The
distinction that we are making between human capital investments, human capital assets, and entrepreneurship outcomes is
important to note, because, although our terminology is in line with several researchers (e.g., Hitt et al., 2001; Lepak and Snell,
1999), there is little consistency in terminology in the literature generally (cf. Reuber and Fischer, 1999; Unger et al., 2011).

Investigating a more dynamic approach to human capital in the context of the potential impact of entrepreneurship education
and training requires a clear delineation of these three terms.
Our work also contributes to a growing body of evidence that human capital assets specific to entrepreneurship have a
stronger link to positive new venture performance than more general human capital assets (Unger et al., 2011). We take this
specificity further to elucidate the differences between two main types of EET—training-focused educational interventions and
academic-focused educational interventions—which we posit will influence outcomes differentially.
Finally, we provide recommendations to future researchers in this field regarding specific methods that should be used in
order to improve the quality and the utility of the information generated. This is consistent with concerns raised by several
scholars regarding the quality of research conducted in the entrepreneurship education field (e.g. Béchard and Grégoire, 2005;
Kailer, 2005; Weaver et al., 2006).
3. Literature review and hypotheses
3.1. Entrepreneurship education research
Several recent narrative reviews of the entrepreneurship education literature (e.g., Kuratko, 2005; Pittaway and Cope, 2007;
Weaver et al., 2006) have noted that there may be important positive links between EET and a variety of entrepreneurshiprelated human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes. For example, it has been reported that individuals who have taken
university-level courses in entrepreneurship have higher intentions to start a business (Galloway and Brown, 2002) than those
who have not taken entrepreneurship courses. Some research further suggests that individuals who have had entrepreneurship
training and education are also more likely to start a business (e.g. Kolvereid and Moen, 1997) than those who have not had
entrepreneurship education and training. They may also be more successful in opportunity identification tasks than those who
have not received entrepreneurship education or training (DeTienne and Chandler, 2004).
There is also research showing that EET may sometimes be negatively associated with the above-mentioned outcomes. For
example, Oosterbeek et al. (2010) measured entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate university students before and
after they completed an entrepreneurship course. They found that students actually had lower levels of intentions to start a
business after completing the course. Similarly, Mentoor and Friedrich (2007) studied the impact of an undergraduate course in
business that focuses on entrepreneurship and small business management, and found negative correlations with a number of
entrepreneurship-related human capital assets. More distally, it has also been shown that training entrepreneurs in business
planning, which is often a key aspect of entrepreneurship education and training programs, can be negatively related to
entrepreneurial performance (Honig and Karlsson, 2004; Honig and Samulsson, 2008).
Entrepreneurship researchers, educators and practitioners are thus left with a dilemma regarding how the conflicting findings of
the outcomes of EET should be interpreted. One interpretation, using the statistical significance “vote count” method employed
by several recent narrative reviews (e.g., Kuratko, 2005), is that there is indeed a significant positive relationship between
entrepreneurship education and a variety of outcomes. However, this assumption has yet to be examined quantitatively. This is
problematic, because there is sufficient reason to question the findings of narrative reviews (Guzzo et al., 1987). These types of reviews
do not take into account the distorting effects of sampling error, measurement error, and other artifacts that might lead to a particular
conclusion in the face of conflicting findings (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990, 2004). These contradictory findings are difficult to incorporate
into narrative reviews (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004), and thus a meta-analysis may be helpful to better interpret the literature.
3.3. Theoretical grounding: human capital theory
Until recently the literature on EET has generally lacked linkage to established theories that would explain the relationship
between education and entrepreneurial behavior (Henry et al., 2005; Kailer, 2005). There has, however, been a recent move to
improve the theoretical grounding of EET findings. One theory that shows promise for understanding the impact of EET is human
capital theory (Becker, 1964; Mincer, 1958). Human capital theory predicts that individuals or groups who possess greater levels
of knowledge, skills, and other competencies will achieve greater performance outcomes than those who possess lower
levels (Ployhart and Moliterno, 2011). Common measures of human capital include level of education, work experience,
upbringing by entrepreneurial parents, and other life experiences. Entrepreneurship researchers have studied the relationship
between human capital and entrepreneurship outcomes at the individual (e.g. Cassar, 2006), group (e.g. Zarutskie, 2010) and
venture (e.g. Colombo and Grilli, 2005) levels of analysis. Also, a long line of research has considered the differential impact
between general human capital and task-related or specific human capital (e.g. Becker, 1964; Gimeno et al., 1997; Zarutskie, 2010),
with Unger et al.'s (2011) recent meta-analysis showing a significantly stronger relationship between task-related human capital and
entrepreneurial performance (rc = .109) than for general human capital (rc = .069), although both correlations are considered small.
Further literature has acknowledged the importance of distinguishing between human capital investments and what we refer
to as human capital assets. This may be an advance on the more traditional “static” view of human capital measured as a fixed set
of knowledge, skills and experiences which currently appears in the scholarly literature (e.g. Reuber and Fischer, 1999; Davidsson
and Honig, 2003). In distinguishing between human capital investments and human capital assets, Unger et al. (2011) recognize
that assets do not derive automatically or uniformly from investments. Individuals of different innate capacities may experience
the same investment, but extract different assets. Further, Sonnentag (1998) showed that experience may or may not lead to
increased knowledge. Here again Unger et al.'s (2011) meta-analysis provides evidence for the incremental value of measuring

<-----Page 3----->214

B.C. Martin et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 28 (2013) 211–224

the relationship between human capital assets and entrepreneurial success (rc = .20) versus human capital investments and
entrepreneurial success (rc = .09). These findings and this general line of inquiry informs our own findings and the development
of a dynamic view of human capital formation in the entrepreneurship field.
3.3.1. Linking EET and human capital theory
At first glance, the link between human capital theory and EET might seem relatively obvious. For example, a variety of
researchers (Unger et al., 2011) have demonstrated the positive relationship between education and success as an entrepreneur.
However, it is not clear that education in entrepreneurship is specifically associated with increases in entrepreneurship-related
human capital assets or entrepreneurship outcomes. Following Becker's (1964) learning perspective of human capital, we
examine the EET literature with the aim of quantifying the relationship between EET and entrepreneurship-related human capital
assets and between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes.
Our review of the extant EET literature has identified 79 studies that have investigated the effectiveness of entrepreneurship
education and training in increasing entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and/or entrepreneurship outcomes. Although
there is still disagreement among authors as to which are the most appropriate variables to measure, and the most appropriate
research methods to ensure meaningful, generalizable results, most of the research supports positive links between EET and three
broad types of entrepreneurship-related human capital assets. First is the relationship between EET and entrepreneurial
knowledge and skills (e.g. Fayolle et al., 2009; DeTienne and Chandler, 2004; Hanke et al., 2010). The second relationship is
between EET and positive perceptions of entrepreneurship (e.g. Peterman and Kennedy, 2003; Souitaris et al., 2007; Cooper and
Lucas, 2007; Zhao et al., 2005). The third relationship is between EET and intentions to start a business (e.g. Athayde, 2009).
Although most studies examining EET and each of the three broad types of entrepreneurship-related human capital assets
indicate positive relationships, some have shown statistically nonexistent or even negative relationships. For example,
Oosterbeek et al. (2010) found a negative relationship between EET and knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial
intentions among undergraduate university students in the Netherlands. It is of note that this is among the more
methodologically rigorous studies in this literature, incorporating both treatment and control samples, with pre- and postintervention responses, and an approximation of a randomized sample. The “treatment group” was required to take an
entrepreneurship course, as a new addition to the general business program in one campus, whereas the “control group” students
were not given the option of taking the course at their campus. As most of the studies we have reviewed in this literature evaluate
entrepreneurship courses that are electives, the work of Oosterbeek and colleagues may not represent a generalizable indication
of the potential for increased entrepreneurial intentions among those who willingly choose to take entrepreneurship courses or
programs. It does, however, provide some insight into the impact of EET on something close to a random sample of both
treatment and control participants. Hanke et al. (2010) found a mix of positive and negative relationships between EET and a
variety of human capital variables, while studying two different EET interventions among university students in the United States,
with both interventions relating negatively to desirability. Mentoor and Friedrich (2007) reported negative relationships between
EET and both knowledge and skills, and attitudes towards entrepreneurship among undergraduate university students in South
Africa, and von Graevenitz et al. (2010) found a small negative relationship between EET and intentions toward entrepreneurship
among German undergraduate students. Three separate studies (Fayolle et al., 2006a; Fayolle and Gailly, 2009; Garalis and
Strazdiene, 2007) found essentially no relationship between EET and knowledge and skills, attitudes, or intentions towards
entrepreneurship, among samples of undergraduate and graduate students in France and Lithuania.
Overall, the independent samples that show negative, nonexistent or mixed relationships between EET and entrepreneurshiprelated human capital assets are more than offset by the numerous independent samples that show positive relationships
between these same variables. Further, given that human capital theory predicts that education will relate positively to human
capital assets, we develop the following hypotheses.
H1. EET will be positively associated with entrepreneurship-related human capital assets.
Several narrative reviews of the entrepreneurship education literature have noted that there may be important links between
EET and entrepreneurship outcomes (e.g., Kuratko, 2005; Pittaway and Cope, 2007; Weaver et al., 2006). More recently, the
relationship between general human capital investments (as opposed to entrepreneurship-specific investments) and
entrepreneurship outcomes was found by Unger et al. (2011) to be positive. Given this, we expect EET as a whole to follow the
same pattern. However, it is important to note that “success” in the EET literature—a literature that for good reason employs
essentially all student samples—is often measured by less distal outcomes than new venture success. Thus the evidence of
recorded entrepreneurial behavior includes nascent behaviors (e.g., Charney and Libecap, 2000), start-up behaviors (e.g., Menzies
and Paradi, 2002); as well as financial success (e.g., Cruz et al., 2009).
H2. EET will be positively associated with entrepreneurship outcomes.
Our review of the literature shows that the type of EET can range from a relatively short training course that focuses on core
entrepreneurship knowledge and skills related to starting a particular business in a particular jurisdiction (e.g. Miron and
McClelland, 1979), to full academic courses that provide a broad theoretical and conceptual understanding of topics, such as how
opportunities are identified, decision making in highly ambiguous contexts, and causation and effectuation (e.g. DeTienne and
Chandler, 2004; Lee et al., 2005). To understand how these two EET types might impact the relationship between EET and
entrepreneurship-related human capital assets, and entrepreneurship outcomes, we consider findings from the field of

<-----Page 4----->B.C. Martin et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 28 (2013) 211–224

215

educational psychology related to the transfer of learning (Thorndike and Woodworth, 1901). Educational psychologists have
shown that variations in the degree of transfer of educational content to application can be attributed in part to the near-far
distinction (Haskell, 2001; Barnett and Ceci, 2002), which refers to the degree of similarity between learning and application
context and content domains. Near transfer refers to application contexts that are similar to the learning contexts, whereas far
transfer refers to dissimilar contexts. Learning transfer is more easily achieved in near contexts (Haskell, 2001; Benander and
Lightner, 2005; Kneppers et al., 2007).
Applying the near-far distinction to EET, we expect that both types of EET should transfer to entrepreneurship-related human
capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes to some extent, as both represent relatively near transfer contexts. However,
training-focused EET might be expected to have a stronger relationship to entrepreneurship-related human capital assets than
academic-focused EET, as the emphasis on core knowledge and skills related to starting a particular business will more easily
transfer to the ability to recall and exhibit entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, for instance. Conversely, academic-focused EET is
likely to transfer better to such entrepreneurship outcomes as financial success and the duration of maintaining a business than
training-focused EET, as these contexts require decision making in highly ambiguous and dynamic conditions. Further, the
content required to deal with them is more “near” to the broad conceptual and theoretical learning in academic-focused
educational settings than training-focused EET. Thus, we hypothesize the following:
H3a. Training-focused EET will be more positively associated with entrepreneurship-related human capital assets than will
academic-focused EET.
H3b. Academic-focused EET will be more positively associated with entrepreneurship outcomes than will training-focused EET.
4. Methods
4.1. The search for primary data
We searched for articles and manuscripts in six ways. First, we searched the electronic databases in the areas of general
business and management education, including ABI/Inform Global Business Index, Business Source Complete, Education Full Text,
ERIC (Education), PsycINFO, Google Scholar, JSTOR and Scholars Portal, among others. Second, we checked all of the references
that might be related to our work in previous reviews of the outcomes of entrepreneurship education and training. Third, we
posted messages requesting both published and unpublished manuscripts on a variety of electronic listservs. Fourth, we wrote a
number of researchers known for their work in the area of entrepreneurship education to assemble a list of possible unpublished
manuscripts, technical reports, and other articles that were available. Fifth, we contacted associations of educational institutions
involved in EET in North America (e.g. National Association for Community Colleges Entrepreneurship (USA), Canadian
Association of Community Colleges), to request technical reports from them and, where possible, directly from their members. Sixth,
we contacted national government bureaus involved with employment data in North America (e.g. Bureau of Labor Statistics (USA),
Industry Canada) to obtain any technical reports related to government-funded self-employment/entrepreneurship training
programs.
It is likely that there exist more technical reports from educational institutions than we were able to find. Early attempts to
contact institutions directly without an established contact proved unsuccessful. However, our extensive use of listservs both in
academia and among the college and entrepreneurship education associations should have provided reasonable coverage of this
group.
4.2. Decision rules for inclusion of studies in meta-analysis
To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to meet several criteria. First, the predictor variable of each study had to have
been either entrepreneurship education (e.g., a university course or program of study) or training. Second, the criterion variables
had to be one of two broad types. The first type was entrepreneurship-related human capital assets, including: 1) knowledge and
skills, which comprised knowledge of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial process (e.g. Fayolle et al., 2009), competency in
identifying innovative business opportunities (e.g. DeTienne and Chandler, 2004) and competency in dealing with ambiguity in
decision making (e.g. Hanke et al., 2010); 2) positive perceptions of entrepreneurship, which comprised attitudes towards
entrepreneurship (e.g. Souitaris et al., 2007), desirability of becoming an entrepreneur (e.g. Cooper and Lucas, 2007), feasibility of
becoming an entrepreneur (e.g. Peterman and Kennedy, 2003), and self-efficacy related to entrepreneurship (e.g. Zhao et al.,
2005); and 3) intentions to start a business (e.g. Athayde, 2009). The second type was entrepreneurship outcomes, including: 1)
nascent behaviors, such as writing a business plan and seeking funding (e.g. Souitaris et al., 2007); 2) start-up (e.g. Kolvereid and
Moen, 1997); and 3) entrepreneurship performance, which comprised financial success (e.g. Karlan and Valdivia, 2006), duration
of running a business (e.g. Chrisman and McMullan, 2004), and personal income from owned business (e.g. Charney and Libecap,
2000). The third criterion required that studies report data that could be included in a meta-analysis (i.e., r values or data that
could be transformed into r values, such as d, t, F, etc.) by making comparisons either pre- and post-EET intervention, or via
treatment and control groups. We coded for moderators, such as age, gender, and type of educational intervention, but, aside from
EET type we found too few studies to allow for moderator analysis. Applying these criteria to our initial list of 79 studies yielded a
final total of 42 independent samples that represent 16,657 students (see Table 1). That is, we excluded 37 studies because they

did not meet one or more of the above-listed criteria. Twenty-one studies were eliminated because they did not incorporate pre–
post or treatment–control comparisons. A further 13 studies were excluded because they did not report the data required for
creating an r value, and we were unable to obtain this information from the authors. A final three studies were eliminated
because, although they met our inclusion criteria, upon further examination they used samples that were duplicated in our
overall list of studies.
4.3. Computation and analysis of effect size
Two measures of effect size are currently popular in the meta-analysis literature; d and r (Jackson et al., 1995; Hunter and
Schmidt, 2004). The d statistic is the difference between two means divided by the within-group standard deviation. The r
statistic is the correlation between the predictor and criterion variables in the total sample pooled across groups. Because the r
statistic works equally well whether two or more levels of predictor variables are defined, we chose weighted r as the primary
measure of effect size. When required, we converted statistics to an r statistic using the Wilson effect size determination program,
recommended by Lipsey and Wilson (2001).

We meta-analyzed the sample-size-weighted correlation coefficients from the studies in the reference list noted with an
asterisk. That is, we recorded the observed r rather than the r corrected for research artifacts. We then weighted the observed
estimates as noted below and analyzed our data with the Schmidt and Le (2004) meta-analysis program.
4.4. Variable coding
The authors coded each of the 42 independent samples identified on 25 items, which were grouped into five categories:
a) entrepreneurship-related human capital assets; b) entrepreneurship outcomes; c) moderators; d) methodology; and
e) publication bias (see Table 2). Entrepreneurship-related human capital assets contained three components: 1) knowledge and
skills (including knowledge of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial process, competency in identifying innovative business
opportunities, competency in dealing with ambiguity in decision making); 2) positive perceptions of entrepreneurship (including
attitudes towards entrepreneurship, desirability of becoming an entrepreneur, feasibility of becoming an entrepreneur, and selfefficacy for entrepreneurship); and 3) intentions to become an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship outcomes contained three
components: 1) nascent behavior, 2) start-up, and 3) entrepreneurship performance (including success in terms of duration,
success in terms of financial performance, and personal income from owned business). Where studies reported two or more
correlations in one category, the correlations were averaged (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990).
We calculated interrater agreement as a percentage, consistent with other meta-analyses (e.g. Barrick and Mount, 1991) and
found overall interrater agreement was 84%, with predictor agreement of 100% and criterion agreement of 78%. By category,
interrater agreement was 76% for entrepreneurship-related human capital assets, 82% for entrepreneurship outcomes, 95% for the
course-type moderator, 89% for the methods variables, and 100% for the publication variable. Disagreements were resolved by
discussion until full consensus was reached.
5. Results
5.1. Analyses
Our analysis was based upon the procedures first developed by Hunter and Schmidt (1990). We calculated effect sizes in a
“bare-bones” manner that corrected for sampling error, but not for other artifacts (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). Sampling error,
which occurs when data are collected from a non-representative sample, is inversely related to sample size and, if not properly
controlled, can dramatically impact the outcomes of a meta-analysis. In fact, sampling error alone has been found to account for

the bulk of artifactual variance in most studies (i.e., more than 90% for small or medium samples and more than 70% for large
samples, e.g., N = 500) (Koslowsky and Sagie, 1994). Other artifacts that can alter the value of outcomes in research include error
of measurement in both the independent and dependent variable, dichotomization of a continuous variable, and range restriction,
among others. We did not correct for these study artifacts because information about them was not available either from the
primary studies or via the requests to the studies' authors.
To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, it was necessary to determine whether our obtained effect sizes differed significantly from zero. To
that end we computed a 95% confidence interval around the estimated population correlation. When the lower boundary of the
confidence interval was greater than zero, effects were deemed to be significant (Judge et al., 2002).
To test the moderation posited in Hypotheses 3a and 3b, we examined homogeneity by applying Hunter and Schmidt's (1990,
2004) “75% rule.” This rule states that effects might be considered homogenous if more than 75% of the variance of the observed
effects is explained by sampling error variance. To assess the statistical significance of the difference between each of our
moderator pairs we calculated z-scores.
5.2. Meta-analytic results
Results for each of the three hypotheses are summarized in Table 3.
Our results indicated a weighted correlation of .217 (K = 33, N = 11,125) between EET and total entrepreneurship-related
human capital assets. It is of note that two studies in our analyses of entrepreneurship-related human capital assets had very large
sample sizes (i.e., Gine and Mansuri, 2009; Karlan and Valdivia, 2006). Because these large samples may have inflated our results,
we ran the analysis without the large samples. These results indicated a weighted correlation of .184 (K = 31, N = 6233) between

<-----Page 8----->B.C. Martin et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 28 (2013) 211–224

EET and total entrepreneurship-related human capital assets. The weighted correlations of these two sets of calculations did not
differ significantly (z = .668, ns), indicating that the large samples did not influence the results. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was
supported. We also examined the three main sub-groups of entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and found a weighted
correlation between EET and entrepreneurship-related knowledge and skills of .237 (K = 17, N = 8334), between EET and positive
perceptions of entrepreneurship of .109 (K = 18, N = 3828), and between EET and intentions to become an entrepreneur of .137
(K = 19, N = 3314).
Regarding entrepreneurship outcome variables, our results indicated a weighted correlation of .159 (K = 13, N = 10,524)
between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes overall. We also ran the analysis without the large samples associated with three
large studies (Gine and Mansuri, 2009; Karlan and Valdivia, 2006; Michaelides and Benus, 2010). Those results indicated a
weighted correlation of .207 (K = 10, N = 2806) between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes. The weighted correlations of these
two sets of calculations did not differ significantly (z = −1.550, ns), indicating that the large samples did not influence the results.
Thus, Hypothesis 2 was supported. We also examined two main sub-groups of entrepreneurship outcomes and found a weighted
correlation of .124 (K = 6, N = 6706) between EET and start-up, and a weighted correlation of .166 (K = 9, N = 5790) between EET
and entrepreneurship performance.
Our moderation analysis results show a weighted correlation of .246 (K = 12, N = 6819) between training-focused EET
interventions and entrepreneurship-related human capital assets. We also ran this analysis without the large samples associated
with two large studies in this group (Gine and Mansuri, 2009; Karlan and Valdivia, 2006). Those results indicated a weighted
correlation of .210 (K = 10, N = 1927) between training-focused EET interventions and entrepreneurship-related human capital
assets. A comparison of the two sets of training-focused studies (i.e., those that included the large samples and those that did not)
indicated that the correlations did not differ significantly (z = .324, ns). The weighted correlation between academic-focused EET
interventions and entrepreneurship-related human capital assets was .180 (K = 21, N = 4306). A comparison of the results for the
training-focused EET studies and the academic-focused EET studies showed that the weighted r for training-focused EET was not
significantly higher in magnitude than for academic-focused EET (z = 1.056, ns). Similarly, when the smaller set of trainingfocused EET studies (excluding the two large samples), was compared with the academic-focused EET studies, the weighted r for
training-focused EET was not significantly higher in magnitude than for academic-focused EET (z = .290, ns). Thus, Hypothesis 3a
was not supported.
Our results indicated a weighted correlation of .151 (K = 9, N = 9353) between training-focused EET and entrepreneurship
outcomes, whereas the weighted correlation between academic-focused EET and entrepreneurship outcomes was .238 (K = 4,
N = 1795). This moderator effect was significant (z = −2.600, p b .01). We also ran the analysis without the large samples
associated with three studies in this group (Gine and Mansuri, 2009; Karlan and Valdivia, 2006; Michaelides and Benus, 2010).
Those results indicated a weighted correlation of .152 (K = 6, N = 1011) between training-focused EET and entrepreneurship
outcomes. This moderator effect was also significant (z = − 4.395, p b .001). A comparison of the two weighted correlations for
training-focused EET (i.e., those that included the large samples and those that did not) indicated that the correlations did not
differ significantly (z = −.026, ns). Thus, Hypothesis 3b was supported.
Finally, we conducted three sets of analyses to determine whether 1) publication bias, 2) study rigor, and 3) sampling bias may
have impacted our results. To examine the potential for publication bias, we compared overall results of all published studies
(rw = .188, K = 29, N = 5729) to unpublished studies (rw = .178, K = 13, N = 10,928). We found that publication bias did not
significantly impact our results (z = .196, ns).
To evaluate study rigor, we compared studies that incorporated both pre- and post-measures of participant responses and
comparisons of treatment and control groups, with those studies that incorporated only one or the other (inclusion criteria for the
meta-analysis required at least one such comparison). We established this rigor threshold based on Cook and Campbell's (1979)
assertion that, as a base, studies that do not contain treatment and control group comparisons and pre- and post-measures are
designs “that often do not permit reasonable causal inferences” (p. 95). Our results indicated a weighted correlation between EET
and overall results of .142 (K = 11, N = 10,233) for rigorous studies, whereas the weighted correlation for those studies that did
not meet our rigor criterion was .246 (K = 31, N = 6424), and this moderator effect was significant (z = 1.990, p b .05). We further
examined study rigor to determine whether there might be a trend to increased rigor over time. To do so we ran a bivariate
correlation analysis of the study rigor variable. We coded all studies that were found to be below our rigor threshold as “1” and all
those there were above the threshold as “2”. We coded our time variable using the year the study was published or produced. We
found that study rigor was not significantly related to the time variable (r = .213, ns).
Finally, we examined how sampling bias may have impacted our results by comparing studies that included random
assignment to treatment and control groups (rw = .156, K = 6, N = 9056) with those that did not include random assignment
(rw = .212, K = 36, N = 7601), and found that random assignment did not have a significant impact on the results (z = .909, ns).
6. Discussion
6.1. Contributions
Although EET programs are growing rapidly around the world, extant qualitative reviews have been equivocal about their
impact on entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes (e.g. Weaver et al., 2006). This is due in
part to the fact that, although most studies report positive relationships, a number of important studies have shown negative
results for EET on entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes. Thus, it is not clear what

<-----Page 9----->220

B.C. Martin et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 28 (2013) 211–224

impact EET might be having on its students. At the same time recent entrepreneurship literature has highlighted the need to
better understand the dynamic nature of human capital development in the highly dynamic entrepreneurship field (Unger et al.,
2011).
Our study addresses these gaps in the entrepreneurship literature in an important way. We have provided a quantitative
assessment of the EET literature showing that EET has positive, significant relationships with a number of entrepreneurshiprelated human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes. This builds on previous work, such as that of Unger et al. (2011) to
show the specific impact of entrepreneurship education and training on human capital development and entrepreneurship
development.
Overall, our results provided full support for the first two hypotheses associated with this study and partial support for the
third hypothesis. Evidence in support of Hypothesis 1 demonstrated that EET is associated with higher levels of (a) total
entrepreneurship-related human capital assets, (b) entrepreneurship-related knowledge and skills, (c) positive perceptions of
entrepreneurship, and d) intentions to become an entrepreneur (see Table 3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that the transfer of entrepreneurship-related human capital investments to entrepreneurship-related human capital assets in the
field of entrepreneurship has been demonstrated via meta-analytic examination.
Evidence in support of Hypothesis 2 showed that EET was positively associated with (a) entrepreneurship outcomes in general
(b) start-up, and (c) entrepreneurship performance (see Table 3). Again, to our knowledge this is the first time this link has been
demonstrated in a quantitative review of the extant entrepreneurship literature. We believe these findings provide some
empirical indication that EET is positively related to important benefits in a number of areas.
Evidence showing partial support for our third hypothesis indicates that the focus of EET interventions does moderate the
relationship between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes, but not the relationship between EET and entrepreneurship-related
human capital assets. Specifically, academic-focused EET was found to have a significantly stronger relationship with
entrepreneurship outcomes than training-focused EET, as we hypothesized, but training-focused EET was not found to have a
significantly stronger relationship with entrepreneurship-related human capital assets than academic-focused EET, contrary to
our hypothesis (see Table 3).
Borrowing from the field of educational psychology, and in particular transfer of learning perspective (Thorndike and
Woodworth, 1901), we argued that the near-far distinction (Haskell, 2001; Barnett and Ceci, 2002) applied to the two broad types
of EET and the differing content and contexts that were required to develop entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and
entrepreneurship outcomes. Specifically, we expected that training-focused EET would be more likely to allow students to
demonstrate the core entrepreneurship knowledge and skills required to start a particular business in a particular setting, because
the learning and application context and content are more “near” than with academic-focused EET. This aspect of our argument
was not supported, and although the reported correlations follow the directions that we expected, the lack of significance in the
differences is difficult to interpret without further study. Future research that more specifically examines the development of
entrepreneurship-related human capital assets in both training-focused and academic-focused EET is needed to help bring clarity
to this issue. However, support for the moderation of EET to entrepreneurship outcome relationship is encouraging. It suggests
that academic-focused EET, with its broader conceptual and theoretical content may be more likely to allow students to make
decisions in the highly ambiguous and dynamic contexts that are required to achieve financial success and maintain a business
over an extended period of time.
We found indications of homogeneity in the correlations for academic-focused EET and for training-focused EET, suggesting
that it is unlikely that moderators are significantly affecting the results. This was not the case for all of our other analyses, where
we found strong indications of heterogeneity in our correlations, suggesting that there are moderators, which might help to better
explain the relationships. Future research should explore these moderators.
Our findings related to study rigor help to quantify a concern that has been raised by scholars, such as Weaver et al. (2006),
that the EET literature suffers from low quality studies. We have noted that a large number of studies were not viable for inclusion
in our meta-analysis because of methodological and/or reporting issues, and that among the 42 studies that were viable for
inclusion, 31 did not meet a high standard of methodological rigor (incorporating both pre- and post-measures of participant
responses and comparisons of treatment and control groups; see Table 1). Although there is a directional indication toward
increased methodological rigor, newer studies are not significantly more rigorous than older studies. We go further, however, to
show that studies that do not meet our criterion for high rigor report stronger relationships than those that do meet the rigor
criterion (see Table 3). In other words, our results suggest that poorer quality studies tend to overestimate the impact of EET. We
hope that by demonstrating this exaggerating influence of low methodological rigor on the impact of EET we will help to
encourage future researchers to conduct more rigorous studies.
Our results suggest that the effect sizes of EET are small using Cohen's (1992) guidelines for categorizing effect sizes. We
compared these results to those found in meta-analyses examining management training in general (e.g., Burke and Day, 1986;
Morrow et al., 1997; Collins and Holton, 2004), which showed medium effect sizes. Reasons for the weaker performance of EET
are difficult to determine. It may be unrealistic to expect outcomes of university courses, many of which may be designed to
introduce students to the subject of entrepreneurship for the first time, to compare favorably with outcomes of management
training courses, many of which are designed and sponsored by companies to improve their current managers' performance.
However, this does not account for the relative low effect sizes that we found among the training-focused courses that were
examined by studies in our analysis (see Table 3). It may be that, when comparing behavioral outcomes, the broad set of
knowledge, skills and competencies that one must put into practice in order to become a successful entrepreneur is of a much
greater magnitude than the more specific sets of skills that are required of a manager to demonstrate transfer of learning from a

<-----Page 10----->B.C. Martin et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 28 (2013) 211–224

221

particular training course to a current management position. Yet this does not account for the relative low effect sizes we found
for knowledge and skills specifically (see Table 3), which are most comparable to the learning outcomes often studied in
management training (cf. Burke and Day, 1986). It may be that EET is simply not developed enough at this point. Further studies
that examine the impact of course design and teaching methods may help to explain these relative weak effect sizes, and, by
identifying important moderators, show that certain types of EET garner larger effect sizes. Such learning, if incorporated into
future EET interventions may lead to improvements that will make EET more effective generally.
6.2. Potential limitations
Contributions aside, this paper is subject to at least three potential limitations. First, our meta-analysis included a variety of
studies that ranged from low to high methodological rigor. Meta-analyses are sometimes criticized for mixing good and bad
studies (Rosenthal and DiMatteo, 2001). This criticism, known as the “garbage in and garbage out” issue (Hunt, 1997: 42), is
relevant to this study. For example, as can be seen in Table 1, some studies did not include a design that compared a treatment
group, whose members received entrepreneurship education or training, with a control group, whose members did not receive
entrepreneurship education or training (e.g., Tam and Hansen, 2009; von Graevenitz et al., 2010). Some designs did not include
measures of variables at both pre- and post-education times (e.g., Charney and Libecap, 2000; Lee et al., 2005). Although we
decided to include these studies, because they represent much of the literature in this field and do provide some indication of EET
outcomes, we acknowledge that the validity of our results would be stronger if all analyzed studies were conducted with a high
standard of methodological rigor. Importantly, our study helps to quantify the impact that study rigor is having on research
results, showing that lower rigor studies may be overestimating the impact of EET.
Second, all but six of the studies we analyzed did not involve randomized assignment to treatment and control groups, which
raises a concern for sampling bias. It is possible that those who have not chosen to take an EET course may demonstrate much
weaker and possibly negative results in terms of entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes.
This was the case with participants in the Oosterbeek et al. (2010) study, which was one of only six studies that we categorized as
random assignment. However, when we meta-analyzed all six studies that included randomized assignment we found that
results were still positive (r = .156) and not significantly lower than those studies that did not employ randomization (r = .212;
z = .909, ns). This suggests that sampling bias did not have a significant impact on the results.
A third potential limitation is that our meta-analysis corrected only for sampling error. This is because we could not find
information relating to other artifacts (e.g., range restriction, reliability estimates, etc.) for the majority of the studies we
identified as having the potential to be included in our meta-analysis. As such, we were left with making a judgment call on their
excludability. These types of judgment calls are common in the majority of meta-analytic research (Guzzo et al., 1987), and our
study is no exception. The exact magnitude of the relationships remains to be confirmed once a broader sample of
methodologically rigorous studies is available. Moreover, this limitation to our study is ameliorated by research that has found the
majority of artifactual variance to be due to sampling error alone (Koslowsky and Sagie, 1994).
6.3. Future research
Although our findings did not show a statistically significant improvement in study rigor over time, we did find evidence of a
positive directional relationship. Further, the fact that all of the 11 studies that met our rigor criterion were produced since 2003
(see Table 1) provides some reason for optimism that the quality of EET research is improving. Nevertheless, many recent studies
have been produced that do not meet a high standard of methodological rigor. In order to improve the literature so that future
meta-analyses can provide even more valuable findings for academics and practitioners, EET researchers must include pre- and
post-EET interventions (ideally at several points in time post-intervention), and should include treatment and control groups.
Souitaris et al. (2007) is an example of a good quasi-experimental design with both pre- and post-intervention surveying and use
of treatment and control groups. Where possible, random assignment to treatment and control groups should be carried out,
although this is often difficult to implement for both practical and ethical reasons. Oosterbeek et al. (2010) show how it may be
possible to reflect random assignment in certain circumstances if researchers are alert to opportunities. In this case, Oosterbeek
and his colleagues identified that the creation of a required course in entrepreneurship for a business program at one campus of a
school and lack of any similar course offering at another campus of the same school created an opportunity to examine the
outcomes of the new entrepreneurship course in a manner that is very close to that of a randomized experiment. Although the
participants were not truly randomized, the authors confirmed through extensive post hoc analysis that the only notable
difference between the two groups was their physical proximity to each campus.
In terms of data reporting, researchers should include correlation tables and estimates of reliabilities. Also, at a minimum,
researchers should report the correlations amongst all study variables in a manner that is consistent with data reporting in other
fields of management research (e.g., providing a zero-order correlation matrix). Such reporting improvements will greatly
increase the ability of future researchers to make accurate claims about the effect sizes of EET on its outcomes. It will also increase
the ease of conducting future meta-analytic reviews of the EET literature.
In terms of potential moderators, where possible, future research should include measures of age, education level, academic
institution, academic program, course type (e.g., required versus elective), ethnicity, nationality, gender, previous entrepreneurship experience, previous employment experience, and participants' perception of course goal, level, and content. We also
recommend obtaining and reporting the main elements of the course syllabus, so that future research can control for the potential

<-----Page 11----->222

impact of course content and structure. This type of information might provide valuable insight into whether such things as
course content (e.g. lecture material, guest speakers, online resources, modes of delivery, etc.), and course goals (e.g., learning
introductory concepts and theory compared to learning specific skills) influence the outcomes of EET interventions. Examining
different methods of employing experiential exercises, such as use of online venture creation simulations versus actual venture
creation projects may also help explain variation in EET outcomes. Other examples of the types of moderation elements that may
be fruitful to examine can be found in several studies included in this meta-analysis. Hanke et al. (2010) compared two
undergraduate university entrepreneurship courses; a new course that employed problem based learning with a more traditional
lecture-style course. Cooper and Lucas (2007) compared two training programs that incorporated different levels of interactive
and experiential learning. The literature would benefit greatly from more examination of this type of course content variation,
especially in studies that employ full quasi-experimental methods and examine both entrepreneurship-related human capital
assets as well as entrepreneurship outcomes.
Future research might also examine differences in course instructors, such as the skill and/or background of course instructors
(e.g. experienced entrepreneur versus academic), or teaching methods employed. For instance it may be that instructors who do
not engage their students via class discussion or fair procedures, for example, are less motivating than instructors who are
perceived to be more engaging or fair, even if the same course materials are used in both cases. Future meta-analyses of EET
outcomes would provide greater insight if these types of moderator variables were examined and reported in all new
studies.
6.4. Concluding remarks
We have provided what we believe to be the first meta-analytic examination of the relationship between EET and both
entrepreneurship-related human capital assets and entrepreneurship outcomes. Our results were supportive of the notion that
entrepreneurship-specific human capital formation can be influenced by entrepreneurship-specific education. This is important,
given the heretofore equivocation of the narrative literature reviews on the subject, particularly in light of the immense growth
and investment in entrepreneurship education on a global scale. We have also provided recommendations for improving the
literature to enhance the value of future EET research results.
