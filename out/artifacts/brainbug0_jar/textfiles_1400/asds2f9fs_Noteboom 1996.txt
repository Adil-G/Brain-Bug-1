Abstract

Groningen, The
Netherlands

this paper a process and control model is developed for the analysis and
design of inter-firm relations, in which both opportunism and trust play a role.
Its aim is to develop a tool for the analysis, diagnosis and design of inter-firm
partnerships. It takes into account the value of the partner, relative to alternatives, and the risk of the relation. Risk depends on the incentives that the partner
may have towards opportunism, his opportunities for opportunism and his ’propensity’ towards opportunism. The latter is related to trust. A partner’s incentives towards opportunism depend on the uniqueness of the value that he offers,
on one’s own switching costs and on the partner’s dependence on the relation.
The underlying theory employs both transaction cost economics and social
exchange theory. On thebasis of the model, values and risks can be balanced
in different ways: there are adversarial strategies that jeopardize value, and
cooperative strategies that build value. The model can be used to explore viable
sequences of strategies of governance, depending on different conditions. As
an illustration, it is used for an analysis of ways to initiate a relation.

Introduction

:

The purpose of the present paper is to set up a process and control
model for the analysis of the process of development of inter-firm relations, and the design of their control ( ‘governance’ ), in which allowance
is made for both opportunism and trust. This aligns with the conclusion
by Smith Ring and Van de Ven (1994: 113) that:
’As the uncertainty, complexity, and duration of economic transactions within
and between firms increase, it becomes increasingly important for scholars
and managers to understand developmental processes of how equity, trust,
conflict-resolution and procedures and internal governance structures emerge,
evolve, and dissolve over time.’

’Even though marketing

aims at understanding, explaining, predicting and
human society (Bagozzi 1975; Dwyer et al. 1987),
most research has been concentrated only on steps leading to choice ... that
end in the selection of suppliers (Webster and Wind 1972), thus leaving all
processes beyond unmentioned.’

such views into account, we focus on the process of developand governance after an exchange relation has been started. Transaction costs comprise costs of search and evaluation, costs of setting
up governance prior to transactions and costs of control and redesign
of the relation. Here, we focus on the third kind.
The question arises of how the present study fits in the growing literature on institutions, and in particular how it relates to transaction cost
economics (TCE). TCE, as developed by Williamson (1975, 1985), has
been called ’new institutionalist’ economics, but shortcomings have
been identified from a ’neo-institutionalist’ perspective, which harks
back to the older American institutionalists like Veblen, Commons and
Mitchell (see, e.g. Johanson and Mattson 1987; Dietrich 1993; Foss
1993; Hodgson 1993; Nooteboom 1992, 1993b; Pitelis 1993, 1994).
We position the present paper in terms of the differences between these
schools of thought.
The ‘new-institutionalism’ of TCE maintains important parts of the core
of neo-classical economics, while ’neo-institutionalist’ economics
includes perspectives from sociology. Some of the characteristic differences between the two schools are summarized in Table 1. Emboldened
material in the table indicates the perspective of the present paper, and
shows that it goes beyond traditional perspectives of mainstream economics, into the neo-institutionalist branch.
We aim to develop a model for studying the process of developing
institutional arrangements between firms, which takes into account the
possibility of trust next to the possibility of opportunism, allowing for
the possibility that the relations between the firms may get locked into

efficient or inefficient paths. It should yield a tool to explore balances
and imbalances of dependence between parties, mixes of trust and
opportunism, and of formal and informal forms of governance. It should
also serve to identify instruments for governance, and to select them
in relation to events that might trigger action. The ultimate objective,
beyond the present paper, is to employ the model as a basis for simulation studies of the evolution of relations, and for applications of game
theory in the analysis of governance. For the use of game theory in an
attempt to reconstruct different generic forms of supplier-user relations
(’Western, Japanese and a third way’), see Nooteboom (1994).
In contrast with TCE, we accept the relevance of sociological categories
such as trust, power, social cohesion and social exchange, but we also
acknowledge possible inclinations towards opportunism, and we preserve notions concerning governance from TCE.
In game-theoretic terms, this paper does not take the perspective of
cooperative games, in the usual sense employed in the literature, that
agreements are assumed to be binding from the start. The challenge is
to show ho~s~ agreements can be made binding; how cooperation can
be achieved in spite of opportunities and possible inclinations towards
opportunism. So, we are oriented towards cooperation as something to
be explained rather than assumed (cf. Hargreaves et al. 1995:

38).
The basic

analysis, in the present paper, is applicable to relations in
general, including both horizontal relations between competitors and
vertical relations of subcontracting, or even entirely different relations,
such as marriages, but subcontracting forms the main intended area of
application.

Transactions are to be seen as being embedded in relations that develop
in time, while these relations in turn are socially embedded in their
environment (Granovetter 1985). It is a peculiar thing in TCE that, on
the one hand, passage of time is crucial, but on the other, relevant
parameters are seen as timeless. According to TCE, a crucial condition
for dependence is that time is required, with repeated transactions, to
recoup transaction-specific investments, and allowance is made for the
emergence of unpredictable contingencies that preclude closed contracts. On the other hand, TCE implicitly assumes the continuation of
e.r ante inability to judge propensities towards opportunism, unchanged
supply and demand conditions (in which no novel and perhaps more
attractive customers or suppliers appear on the scene), productive competencies and abilities to monitor partner’s actions. But surely, ongoing
interaction will modify those parameters? It is reasonable to say that
prior to transaction one is uncertain about the partner’s potential opportunism, and hence should take opportunism into account. Once one

takes time into account, in ongoing transactions, it is unreasonable to
ignore the formation of perceptions about propensities towards opportunism, and the possibility of building trust.
In spite of Williamson’s acknowledgement of ’atmosphere’ as a relevant factor in transactions, he neglects issues of trust and power. The
view of the present paper is that these issues are important, and that a
dynamic treatment of ongoing relations allows for the building of trust.
To study this, we need contributions from sociology and anthropology
on trust and social exchange (Homans 1961; Blau 1964; Luhmann 1979,
1988; Granovetter 1982, 1985; Gambetta 1988a).
The view that transactions are embedded in relations that develop in
time has been advocated for a number of years in marketing and purchasing by the International Marketing and Purchasing Group (IMP;
Hakansson 1982, 1987; Hagg and Johanson 1983; Easton 1989) and
others (Jarillo 1988; Semlinger 1991; Lamming 1993). Exchange leads
to mutual adaptation, which entails investment in a relation. As a result
of this, bonding between the actors develops, trust is generated and a
lasting relation emerges (Johanson and Mattson 1987, Easton 1989). A
comparable attempt towards a process approach was recently published
by Smith Ring and Van de Ven (1994).
However, if the IMP view can be taken to imply a rejection of the TCE
view as a whole, it runs the risk of throwing away the baby with the
bathwater. Doubtless, in present conditions of turbulence, finns require
interactions in networks. Trust forms an important dimension in such
relations, and, as pointed out by Hirschmann ( 1984), trust may increase
with its usage. However, there are risks as well: trust is not unbounded,
it cannot be taken for granted and it may break down. As Dasgupta
(1988: 54) put it: ’If the incentives are right a trustworthy
(untrustworthy) person may be relied upon to be untrustworthy
(trustworthy)’. ’Golden opportunities’ of defection are tempting, even
to the trustworthy.
TCE has contributed greatly by specifying rigorously what the nature
and extent of risk in transactions is: to the extent that agents are inclined
towards opportunism, and if bounded rationality makes it impossible
to foresee it and to foreclose its undesirable consequences, then one
runs the risk of loss of investment to the extent that investments are
relation specific, or of ’hold-up’ situations as a consequence of that
risk. Next, TCE has supplied indications of how to construct schemes
for ‘governing’ transactions in such a way that risks are reduced: in
bilateral private ordering, the use of different guarantees to compensate
for one-sided, transaction-specific investments (symmetrical specific
investments, cross-ownership of specific assets, hostages, guaranteed
price, volume or period of purchase), and countermeasures to guard
against invalid use and expropriation of such guarantees. In infrequent
transactions: trilateral governance, with some third party acting as an
arbitrator. These concepts are of theoretical and practical use, and it is
unwise to ignore them.

Transaction

on the basis of trust, with its implicit, pre-existing and
unspecified conditions for cooperation, economizes on the specification
and monitoring of contracts and material incentives for cooperation.
This makes it not only cheaper (and to the taste of many, also more
agreeable), but also makes for greater flexibility. With detailed formal
contracts it is more difficult (slow and costly) to modify terms for
changed conditions. Apart from its own worth, trust pays, but it also
carries a risk of betrayal. One cannot simply buy into trust. If it is not
already in place prior to transaction, trust has to be built up. It is as
much the result of cooperation as a condition for it. All one can do is

in economics that optimal behaviour
because agents are calculatively competent,
but because the pressures of selection in markets extinguish sub-optimal
behaviour, either because it loses its resources for survival to agents
with more optimal conduct, or because it turns around to emulate more
optimal conduct. It is, in fact, questionable whether this mechanism is
indeed always so rigorous as to allow only the ’single exit’ (Latsis
1980) of optimal behaviour. There may be slack due to lack of competition, due to mono- or oligopoly and lack of contestability of markets,
or due to product differentiation. But that is not an issue we will discuss
here.
The argument also appears in transaction cost economics (TCE).
Williamson ( 1975, 1985) argued that among alternative governance
structures (market, ’hierarchy’, forms ’between market and hierarchy’)>
one will survive which is optimal, i.e. minimizes the sum of production,
transaction and organization costs, in a given technological and institutional environment. The argument was carried further by Hill (1990).
He argued that since trust economizes on the cost of governance, the
selection pressures of markets will lead to the prevalence of trust, so
that ’in the long run’ we can forget about opportunism.
However, the argument is flawed in the same way as, more often, arguments for group selection are flawed: it neglects the tension between
collective and individual interest. While it is clearly in the interest of
a group as a whole for everyone to be trustworthy and trusting, since
that would greatly reduce transaction costs for all, individuals may be
tempted to defect and be opportunistic while pretending to be trustworthy. The extent of this temptation increases as more people are trustworthy, and it further depends on the efficiency and reliability by which
such defection can be detected and communicated, and the ensuing risk
of a loss of reputation that is detrimental to future partnerships.
Nooteboom (1995) developed a model to analyse the issue. It is concluded that even if loss of reputation becomes infinitely costly, there
still arises some non-zero equilibrium value of the percentage of opportunistic agents. If we allow only for self-interest, opportunism will not
disappear, and Williamson remains correct on this, if not on other

there is always a chance that a transaction partner may be opportunistic. Nevertheless, it helps considerably if, next to self-interest, there
are other sources of cooperation in the institutional environment in
which firms are embedded. Norms and values of conduct may mitigate
inclinations towards opportunism; they may cause people to forego
opportunities for opportunism, at least within reasonable bounds (short
of ’golden opportunities’ that are too tempting to resist). Here, Hill’s
(1990) argument carries conviction: societies with such institutional
mitigation of opportunism have a competitive advantage over societies
that do not, and they may thereby have a better chance of surviving in
world markets.
We conclude that both trust and opportunism are likely to arise in transaction relations. Neither should be ignored, and we should find a way
of systematically exploring their joint occurrence. Therefore, in spite
of the differences between economics and sociology, we should seek
to integrate them.

The concept of trust is subtle, diffuse and elusive. One feels some sympathy for the economist’s inclination to evade the issue, but we cannot
afford to do that. Here, I try to employ the concept with all the subtleties
found for it in the literature (Gambetta 1988a).
Since our focus is on relations between organizations, the question
arises as to what the relation is between the conduct of individuals and
the conduct of firms: the ’micro-micro’ problem. As argued by Smith
Ring and Van de Ven ( 1994), these two sets of conduct are related by
roles to which individuals are assigned in organizations. Conduct qua
persona’ is restricted and guided by organizational roles and alignment
between the two can be a problem. If cooperation is founded on trust
based on personal bonding, problems may arise concerning the exigencies of organizational role. Personal loyalty may deviate from organizational interest, and may even lead to corruption or embezzlement. Too
strong personal ties may need to be prevented by turnover of personnel
across roles. Conversely, personnel change may lead to a breakdown
of relations based on personal trust. Such considerations should be part
of governance.
Trust may concern a partner’s abilitv to perform according to agreements (competence trust), or his intemiolls to do so (goodwill trust).
Here, we focus on the latter type of trust. Of course, risks due to failures
of competence are important in subcontracting relations, but they do
not form the focus here. The focus is on the relations between goodwill
trust and cooperation. Whenever we use the term ’trust’, this denotes

goodwill trust.
According to Williams ( 1988), cooperation requires willingness to
accept dependence, which requires assurance that other, non-dependent

(or less dependent) parties will

not defect in the cooperation. According
is associated with expectations regarding the
other’s choice of actions that have a bearing on one’s own choice of
action. Such expectations may have a strong or a weak basis, ranging
from assurance from objective facts and logical reason, through belief
which is less firmly based on experience and argument, to unsubstantiated faith. Gambetta (1988b: 217) summarized different views on trust
as the subjective probability that one assigns to action by another agent
(or group of agents) which affects one’s own action. Luhmann (1988)
emphasized that in trust there is an element of choice. If there is no
choice, and one simply has to surrender to the powers that be, the belief
that no harm will occur is a matter of confidence, not trust. Trust entails
an action that one has a choice to conduct, and that one may later regret.
One may or may not trust a potential business partner, and accept or
refuse him as a partner. If it goes wrong, one attributes blame also to
oneself for engaging in the relation. One has confidence or not in the
law, or the political system, or God, without a choice as to whether or
not to participate in them. If one is treated unjustly, the blame is on
the system; not one’s own choice.
Williams ( 1988) distinguished between macro and micro, and between
egotistic and non-egotistic sources of cooperation. Micro sources
depend on the specific relation at hand, while macro sources apply
more generally. This yields four sources of cooperation, as indicated
in Table 2.

Cooperation

Williams argued that none of these sources suffices by itself, and that
in cooperation some mix will always be operative, while no universally
best mix, regardless of specific conditions, can be specified. As set out
by Gambetta ( 1988b), the Mafia employs all four sources, in ways that
mutually reinforce each other. Cooperation is forced by violent means,
is materially rewarded, is enhanced by bonds of friendship and pseudo

family relationships (Mafia ’families’, brotherhood, godfathers, etc.)
and an ethic of non-betrayal (~/~~’~’).
If trust is associated with a subjective probability that a partner will
not misuse one’s dependence, without further qualifications, then anything that contributes to such subjective probability would belong to
trust. However, trust is generally not associated with motives of selfinterest ;

if he is likely to cooperate, even if he is not coerced
direct material interest in doing so. Thus, trust is
associated with the non-egotistic sources of cooperation; with loyalty
to a partner due to ethics or bonds of friendship or kinship rather than
coercion or material self-interest. The Mafia needs to employ coercion
and the lure of material interest because trust will not suffice as a basis
for cooperation. Conversely, material self-interest and coercion are
seldom sufficient as a basis for cooperation; one needs trust to the extent
that one cannot fully control the partner’s conduct by threat and reward
(cf. Deutsch 1962, quoted in Zand 1972).
One can object that the narrower concept of trust, when based on ties
of ethics or kinship, is not really beyond self-interest, because they
constitute social coercion rather than choice. In friendship or, more
weakly, in relations of empathy or familiarity, trust in the sense of
non-obligational and non-material sources of cooperation appears to be
most ’thick’. But even there, one can argue that it is based on selfinterest, in the form of the ’emotional utility’ derived from it. One could
argue, therefore, as economists do, that in the last analysis, motivation
on the basis of norms, bonding, social exchange, kinship, friendship or
whatever, is also egotistic. In fact, anything that anyone does can be
interpreted as ’revealed preference’. One objection to this view is that it
has made itself unfalsifiable, but there are two other objections.
The first objection is taken from social exchange theory (Blau 1964).
In addition to an economic dimension (extrinsic utility), exchange often
has a social dimension (intrinsic utility). Economists tend to think of
value in exchange as something that exists independently from the
transaction. As formulated by Murakami and Rohlen (1992: 70); ’The
value of the relationship itself is typically ignored and the impersonality
of the transaction is assumed’. In intrinsic utility, the exchange process
itself matters, in addition to the economic surplus and its division that
the exchange yields. People may prefer to transact on the basis of trust
and its concomitants of ethics, kinship, friendship or empathy. Social
exchange relies more on unspecified, implicit obligations, which depend
on shared systems of meaning, belief and ethics. The idea that exchange
includes non-contractual elements, of course, goes back (at least) to
Durkheim (1893). The economist will answer that there are apparently
two dimensions of utility (extrinsic and intrinsic), and if one prefers to
transact with party X in spite of higher extrinsic returns from a transaction with party Y, apparently intrinsic utility dominates extrinsic utility,
but self-interest as a driver of conduct remains in the seat. Be that as
it may, the point is that economists tend to neglect intrinsic utility and
its implication that it does matter who the transaction partner is. What
matters is that personality and social embeddedness enter as dimensions
of transactions.
The second, more general, objection is that there is often tension
between private material interest (monetary gain) and interest in ethical
norms, social cohesion, kinship, friendship and the like. There is a real

<-----Page 9----->issue of sacrificing one for the sake of the other. This goes beyond
material interest in the form of maintaining reputation as a basis for
future material benefit. One should include in one’s investigation how
these conflicts are resolved, and how one dimension may mitigate the
effect of the other. How opportunism may be mitigated by trust, and
how loyalty may be broken by some ’golden opportunity’ to
defect.
Trustworthiness varies between agents. It is to some extent personal,
in bonds of kinship and friendship, but also to some extent impersonal,
when a person observes a given ethic or set of behavioural routines.
When the agent is a firm, its trustworthiness is associated with ethics
and behavioural routines, which are part of an organization’s culture.
Again, firm and individual are connected by organizational roles, and
again, the alignment between a person qua persona and his organizational role may not be perfect. That depends, among other things, on
the care in role allocation and discipline in role observance that the
firm exercises. Variability of trustworthiness, and hence of its opposite
propensity towards opportunism, underlines the need to extend TCE
with considerations of trust. If not, everyone is equally opportunistic;
then, in the selection of a partner and in governing a relation with him,
one should try to establish his particular propensity towards opportunism (cf. Noorderhaven 1995).
Social exchange, by its nature, is restricted to insiders: people with
whom one shares the basis for trust. Trust requires familiarity and
mutual understanding, and hence depends on time and context.

Definition of Trust

..

On the basis of the above,

we

adopt

the

following conceptualization:

X is willing to engage in cooperation with Y (i.e. enter upon cooperation or
continue it), even if it makes X dependent, if X has a more or less wellgrounded belief, in the form of a subjective probability, that Y will cooperate
in the sense of not mis-using such dependence. This belief may be based on
(perceived) available opportunities for misuse on the part of Y, Y’s incentives
towards misuse and Y’s propensity to employ the opportunities. Propensity to
use opportunities for defection is related to trust, which has its basis in ethics,

kinship, friendship or empathy.
My definition of (goodwill) trust

would now be as follows:
X trusts Y to the extent that X chooses to cooperate with Y on the basis of a
subjective probability that Y will choose not to employ opportunities for defection that ,Y considers damaging, even if it is in the interest of Y to do so. The
trustworthiness of Y depends on Y’s true propensity to employ those

(1)

opportunities.
~

Note that ( 1 ) indicates that:
- X and Y have a choice: to engage upon cooperation, at the risk of
dependence (X), and to forego opportunities to misuse such dependence ( Y). This distinguishes trust from confidence.

golden opportunities.

Defection is closely related to the concept of opportunism, as employed
in TCE: ’interest seeking with guile’, and to make the connection with
TCE we will equate the two. Thus, we will speak of ’opportunities for
opportunism’, and the ’propensity’ to employ them. We may define
power as opportunities to act against someone’s interest in a way that
he cannot control. Then power is close to opportunities for opportunism.
Trust is then associated with the voluntary submission to power, on the
belief that it will not be exercised.
In the case of an organization, the subjective probability associated with
trust depends on an assessment of: the ethical stance and routines that
fonn part of the culture of the tirm, the ’tightness’ with which individuals are tied to it in their organizational roles, relevant characteristics
of the individual one is dealing with (his personal ethics, bonding) and
the net effect on his propensity towards opportunism.
Now, is reputation a basis for trust, or is it part of interest’? It can be
either or both. In economics, the rationale for reputation is that it is
built upon investments in the form of opportunities for opportunism
foregone. To behave opportunistically is to surrender the investment,
if opportunism is both detected and communicated at large, and this
yields a rational basis for people to rely on reputation, at least to some
extent (reputation may be surrendered when a ’golden opportunity’ presents itself). A complication is that reputation may be based on the
rational calculation of its benefit, as indicated, but may also be based
on genuine trustworthiness in the sense of a non-egotistic propensity
to forego opportunities for opportunism (on the basis of ethics, kinship,
friendship, empathy). While both may be sensitive to temptation, trustworthiness is more robust than calculation. It is less sensitive to the
condition of detectability and communicability of a breach, and is less
likely to unravel when the end of a relation is in sight. The difference
may not be easy to establish: that may require some minimum degree
of experience and familiarity with a partner, or joint membership of a
social community with sufficiently strong nonns and values of

cooperation.

.

B. How will agents act and react within that relation? They may be
jockeying for advantage, short of breaking up the relation. This
question can be broken down into two questions:
B 1. How do agents behave in a relation, i.e. in a setting with given
parameters of the relation’? For example: when will they act

opportunistically?
.

B2. How do they behave in trying to change the relation, i.e. change
the parameters of the relation? For example: how can they balance risk and value?
The answer to question A seems simple: people engage upon a relation
because it yields value, which may have many (extrinsic and intrinsic)>
dimensions. In this paper we focus on question B. We consider question
B 1 in the next section, and question B2 in the one after that.

Model of Conduct

.

Relations of cooperation are incurred from an expectation of value.
Thus, the value to X of a partner Y (VYX) is a key variable. Here, it is
specified as value relative to the next best alternative, which becomes
negative when a more attractive partner presents himself. This allows
for the event of a more attractive alternative partner emerging on the
scene, and the analysis of its consequences for the relation.
This concept of the value of a partner in relative terms (excess value
with respect to the next best alternative) is not present, at least

not

explicitly, in TCE. TCE, as developed by Williamson, assumes that for
contracting out, there is a specialized supplier who offers value in ternls
of an ability to produce more efficiently, because he produces in larger
volumes for more than one user. The search for a focal user, and the
evaluation of such a partner’s worth, is not part of the analysis (in
contrast with Coase, who does pay attention to transaction costs in the
form of search). One could perhaps argue that, implicitly, such an evaluation is nevertheless present in Williamsonian TCE, in the possibility
of new contingencies (’external uncertainty’), that may arise which a
partner might exploit opportunistically. However that may be, we need
to make it explicit, for two reasons. First, to deal with the risk that a
relation will become destabilized due to the emergence of a novel, more
attractive alternative for one of the partners. Second, to allow for investments for the increase of value, on either or both sides of the relation.
Both are part of the project of making TCE dynamic, by looking at
the evolution of relations in the light of changing conditions, learning,
etc.

Value may include many dimensions, such as: efficiency, developmental capability, flexibility, adherence to specifications, network position, value as a source of learning, international presence, continuity.

variable from the beginning. However, analytically, it is
maintain the distinction. First of all, switching costs are related
to specific investments that cause value. Second, they primarily contrihute to one’s own vallie to the partner, rather than his value for you.
Value also includes competence trust: an assessment of the partner’s
capability to perform and to achieve goals of quality, service, delivery
time, knowledge transfer, payment, etc.
Value is assessed not only in the present, but also on the basis of potential for the future. This is taken to imply some assessment of the probability that the relation will proceed in the future. As is well known from
repeated games (Axelrod 1984), this is crucial: a rational decision to
defect opportunistically is then based on a trade-off between advantage
now and possible loss of value from an ongoing relation in the future.
In particular, opportunism affects perceived probabilities of an ongoing
relation. Renunciation of opportunities for opportunism will enhance
trust. This may contribute directly to value by increasing intrinsic value,
and indirectly by increasing perceived probabilities of an ongoing
relation.
The other side of the coin is risk, due to dependence, and as a result
of that: the size of damage that the partner may do, and the probability
that he will do it:

where: LOX = possible loss for X; SLX = size of the loss for X; PLX =
probability of loss for X.
The damage may consist of several things:
Loss of extrinsic value, in the economic surplus from the exchange
(due to neglect or accident). This may include disasters, with a cost
that exceeds (one’s share in) the value of the surplus.
Redistribution of the economic surplus (due to opportunism).
Damage due to a break of the relation (which may be non-intentional,
e.g. when the partner goes bankrupt).
Loss due to spill-over of proprietary information.
Loss of intrinsic value.
Spill-over of sensitive information to competitors, via the partner, is a
risk to the extent that knowledge is transferred, but while the relation
lasts, the partner has an interest in preventing it. The risk is particularly
high if the relation is broken opportunistically; on purpose rather than
by accident. In fact, sensitive information may be treated as a

‘hostage’.
The loss for X due to a break of the relation equals switching costs
(SWX) plus the relative value of the partner Y ( ~’YX ). The cost of breakage determines dependence on cooperation in the sense of the ’captiveness’ of X (CAPX): damage due to the redistribution of surplus
cannot systematically exceed the damage due to a break of the relation,
because if it did, X would be likely to break the relation. Disasters,

include the costs associated with specific investof TCE: e.g. specific investments that one has
oneself incurred; guarantees given to cover the risk of specific investments by the partner; the value to X of hostages supplied, etc.
If we look only at goodwill trust and ignore disasters, risk depends
wholly on the possibility of opportunism. In formula:

Each of the above form a necessary condition for opportunistic acts,
which is expressed by the following multiplicative specification:

where: IOY, OOY and POY are normalized to take values between 0
and 1
OOY = 0 for a closed contract and =1 for the absence of any
formal constraints on action; POY is the probability that Y will utilize
opportunities for opportunism.
There is similarity here to the notion in TCE that there are transaction
costs only if there are specific assets and there is bounded rationality
and there is opportunism. As we shall argue, specific assets yield
switching costs and hence captivity and hence an incentive to opportunism ; bounded rationality precludes closed contracts with perfect monitoring and thereby opens opportunities for opportunism; the possibility
of opportunistic conduct is here reconstructed as ’propensity towards

opportunism’.
opportunism (lOY) belong to the dimension of intercooperation (Table 2), and are associated with what
in TCE is called ’private ordering’ or ’relational contracting’. It depends
on the captiveness of X (CAPX), and hence on the value of Y to X and
on switching costs. The first depends on the degree to which Y has

An earlier prototype of the model was discussed with representatives from
several industries. One was the automobile industry, at a time of declining
sales ( 1993), which yielded great competitive pressure, and consequently
high pressure on suppliers. Here, our ideas concerning the role of trust
met with scepsis bordering on ridicule: trust was something they could
not afford to build on. Other representatives were from the firm that has
a monopoly in the exploration and production of natural gas. They balked
at our discussion of potential opportunism: they had easy, amicable, generous relations with their suppliers. Unlike the automobile industry, they
easily afford to.

could

Y’s incentives towards opportunism also depend on the extent to which
Y perceives himself to be dependent on X: if Y is more dependent on
X than vice versa, it is in Y’s interest to be careful about opportunism.
Y should also take into account the effect that opportunistic action may
have on the intrinsic value of the relation and on perceived probabilities
of an ongoing relation, and hence future value and particularly if he
takes into account the possible retaliation by X, which may yield a
downward spiral of mutual retaliation. Y should take into account the
risk of breakdown of the relation, yielding complete loss of the relative
value of his partner, switching costs, loss of hostages, spill-over to

competitors.
Note that this part of our model (IOY) incorporates what is studied in
game-theoretic studies of the outcomes of interaction, except that here we
set up a framework for reproducing the process of strategic interaction.
The literature (Axelrod 1984) demonstrates that there is an infinite
number of equilibria in the repeated prisoner dilemma game. Rather than
taking any of these for granted, we want to reproduce the emergence of
sequences of choices and their effects on further choices.
Opportunities for opportunism (OOY) belong to the source of coercion
(Table 2), by contractual, legally enforceable restrictions on Y’s conduct, or what in TCE is called ’legal ordering’. As recognized in TCE,
they also depend on the occurrence of unforeseen contingencies
(’external uncertainty’), which arise to the extent that the environment
is volatile (shifts in technologies or markets, for example). They also
depend on X’s ability to monitor Y’s actions (’asymmetric
information’), and on Y’s competence to utilize the opportunities. In
connection with this, they are also related to firm size: due to a greater
spread of activities over more products and wider markets, larger firms
have more diversified partnerships and thereby are better able to spread
risk and cross-subsidize activities (Nooteboom 1993a).
Propensity towards opportunism belongs to the category of trust: norms/
values, ethics, customs and bonds of kinship or friendship. Trust tends
to grow as the relation proceeds successfully, because bonds of empathy
may get stronger, or because habituation occurs. The setting up of a

Note also that the arrows from IOY, OOY and POY intersect, rather

designed to reflect the possibility of interaction effects. A large value
of X’s captivity (CAPX) determines the gain that Y may take from
opportunism [’golden opportunity’, see (31], and this may affect his
incentive to grasp the opportunity (IOY). The incentive interacts with
propensity towards opportunism (POY), in that it may exceed the
boundaries of Y’s trustworthiness. If X seeks to restrict Y’s opportunities

This scheme has been tested in empirical research (Berger et al. 1995;
Nooteboom et al. 1995), and has been used for preliminary attempts to
diagnose buyer-supplier relations in practice. The empirical research
was aimed at testing the model on the basis of surveys. Psychometric
techniques were used for measuring variables, and these were fed into
econometric models to test hypotheses derived from Figure 1. The
first study (Berger et al. 1995) involved a survey of 80 suppliers to a
producer of state-of-the-art photocopying machines. The second
(Nooteboom et al. 1995) involved 10 customer relations each for 10
suppliers of sub-assemblies to end-producers of electrical/electronic
apparatus. Examples of the exploratory use of the model in practice will
be discussed in the text. Below is an illustration.

of the relation between a supplier of hard/software (Y) to a consortium of firnis that develop worldwide telecom services (X) showed that
the buyer was extremely dependent on the supplier: it was their single
supplier (in our model: causing high ~~YX), and switching costs (5’WX)
were extremely high, thus yielding high captivity (CAPX). On the other
hand, the supplier had multiple customers, suggesting a modest relative
value of the buyer (VXY), faced limited switching costs (SWn, thus
yielding low captivity (CAPY). This suggested a danger of one-sided
dependence of the buyer, in terms of the size of possible loss (SLX). The
buyer recognized this, and was contemplating a switch to dual suppliership, in spite of the enormous duplication of costs involved. On the
basis of the model, we found that, nevertheless, dependence was balanced
in that the buyer supplied such a unique opportunity for the supplier to
penetrate fast-growing world markets in telecom that the supplier would
have absolutely no interest in exploiting the one-sided dependence of the
buyer (low incentive IOY) and, furthermore, was large enough not to run
the risk of default. As a result, the extent and size of possible loss to the
buyer (SLX) was compensated by a low probability (PLX). The buyer
decided not to go for dual sourcing, for the time being.

Analysis

Model of Governance

’

So far, we have considered the implications of given parameter values
in the relation. Now we turn to the possibilities of control by modifying
the parameters. Figure 1 applies to both sides of a relation, as illustrated
in Figure 2. For governance (control), we must add a control loop,
whereby partners can redesign the relationship to lessen dependence.
This yields actions which constitute events that are internal to the relation, and may call forth reactions by the other side, and so on, perhaps
until some equilibrium arises, possibly in the nature of a Nash equilibrium. In Figure 2, single lines indicate effects of parameters; double

practice.
In a relation between a supplier of specialty chemicals (Y) to a producer
of semi-conductors (X), there appeared to be extreme captiveness of the
buyer (single supply, yielding high 6’YX, and high investments dedicated
to receiving the specific products and services from the supplier, yielding
high SWX). The supplier, on the other hand, had many alternative customers (ostensibly yielding modest BlXY)and limited switching costs
(SYVY), due to limited specific investments. On further inspection, VXY
turned out to be higher, since the buyer was yielding the supplier access
and prestige in a vital growth market. This might yield balance of dependence, but it seemed to be wearing off: the supplier seemed to have learned
most of what there was to learn, and was already cashing in on the prestige. Meanwhile, the dependence of the buyer was only increasing, with
an ostensible increase of both size and probability of loss (SLX, PLX). On
the other hand, the relation was characterized by extreme openness. In
our analysis we conducted interviews at both sides, with a proposal for
holding answers to certain potentially sensitive questions secret from the
other side, but this offer was rejected by both sides. We were encouraged

including opportunities for opportunism, etc., within a meeting with representatives from both
sides. Both sides acknowledged that our analysis was valid, and they
would certainly use that kind of thinking in other relations, but in this
particular relation there was no need, because ’both sides fully trusted
each other’. The relation had developed over a protracted period of time,
with great mutual benefit, and strong bonding and social exchange had
developed. Thus, there seemed to be a very low propensity towards opportunism on both sides (low POY and POX), which also appeared to reduce
the probability of loss for the buyer. Yet, we felt more confident when
we heard that the next stage in the development of the relation involved
a much higher level of specific investments (notably high location
specificity) on the part of the supplier (yielding higher SWI7.

Note that apparently perverse acts of governance may be rational for
the sake of committing oneself and thereby facilitating participation by

to high specific investments. This may be done by participating in their

This

yields an interpretation of the previous illustration. The chemical
supplier was willing to increase his specific investments at the plant of the
buyer, both for further improvement of mutual value, but also to redress an
imbalance of dependence that was in his favour, but might jeopardize the
buyer’s confidence.

Another noteworthy strategy is the following. If one’s captivity
becomes negative (CAPX < 0), perhaps because one has found a more
attractive alternative partner (with an excess of value greater than
switching costs), a plausible action would be to try and get out of the
relation at the lowest possible cost. However, there is the alternative
of investing in one’s partner (increasing VYX) to such an extent that

longer wants to get out.
analysing actions and their triggers, we should consider the possibility of imperfect perception. The most crucial problem of limited
perception pertains to the partner’s propensity towards opportunism
(POY). This seems so basic to the issue that it cannot be ignored. One
will form an opinion on the partner’ propensity on the basis of:
true propensity, to the extent that one can infer such propensity directly, on the basis of experience or reputation;
actual opportunistic behaviour.
For modelling purposes, one might envisage a Bayesian procedure, whereby prior estimates of propensity towards opportunism are adapted as a
function of events. If no opportunism is perceived, the subjective probability of the partner’s taking advantage of opportunities for opportunism
may decline; when opportunism is perceived, it will increase.
A further complication arises when something happens to the detriment
of X, but Y claims that it is due to some mishap beyond his control. Is
this true or is Y trying to mask opportunism’?

- The assessment of value includes expectations about a prolonged relationship, which depend on imperfectly perceived propensities of the

presume knowledge about alternative partners and their value, which
presupposes an ongoing collection of information on such alternatives. It is possible that this is, in fact, neglected.

’A firm that made the transition from customary multiple, price-oriented sourcing to single sourcing aimed at cooperation in development, on the basis of

and concentrate on other more demanding and competitive customer relations.
After seven years the firm found out by coincidence that its suppliers had
seriously lagged behind potential competitors.’

Generic

Strategies

.

.

We have generated quite a rich structure of interaction. To maintain
grasp of complexity we now reduce the multitude of possible actions
of governance to a small set of ’generic strategies’, in Table 3.
Note that there are adversarial and cooperative means of increasing a
partner’s captivity (CAPY T ). Cooperative: increase one’s value relative
to the partner ( VXY T ) by investing in further adaptation to the partner,
and thereby incurring specific investments; invite hostages in the form
of information about the partner’s technology in order to improve
cooperation in development of his products or processes (SM/Y I ).
Adversarial: increase one’s relative value (BlXY i ) by blocking Y’s
access to alternative partners; demand ’improductive hostages’, without
adding value for Y (SWY T ).
We now have an instrument for exploring time paths of relations:
sequences of actions that affect the parameters of the relation in
response to outside events or internal events in the form of actions of
the partner that influence the parameters of the relation. We could do
that by simulation, on the basis of assumed perceptions, behavioural
routines (responses to different types of perceived phenomena, in terms
of attempts to change the parameters of the relation) and their possible
adaptation. We could also employ game theory, using backward induction to see what (sub-game perfect) equilibria may appear.
Many situations can be set up for analysis, but for the purpose of illustration we will discuss only one particularly interesting situation: the
beginning of a relation. At the beginning of a relation, a key problem,
as indicated also in TCE, is that, ~.B ante, it is difficult to judge propensity towards opportunism. Then, as argued in TCE, one should take the

formal, contractual measures until trust has been built up to relax them,
or vice versa: build trust first and formalize later? How should one set
the ball rolling’? Many readers will have more or less informal experience in this case. We have not yet constructed a systematic empirical
case that may serve as an illustration, but our theoretical analysis is
given below.
Suppose that X chooses binding. If this takes the form of tying Y down
in a formal detailed contract (OOY t ), the danger is that this may antagonize any inclination towards trust that Y may have, or may create the
impression that, in his expectation of opportunism, X himself is inclined
towards it. The first may increase Y’s propensity towards opportunism
(POY T ), and the second may cause Y to retaliate with restrictive measures (OOX 1 ). There is a danger of a vicious cycle of distrust and
mutual restrictions. Game theory also teaches us that it is unwise to
demand that the precise date of terminating the relation be set in
advance, as part of formal, legal ordering, because then, cooperation
may unravel before it can properly start. Jockeying for the best exit
condition rather than exploring novel potentialities then determines the
relation. Private ordering is also cheaper, and allows for greater flexibility. Thus, this approach is ill-advised if X wants to develop the relation. Other adversarial measures of binding, such as blocking the partner’s access to alternatives or demanding improductive hostages,
likewise invites retaliation and a closing rather than opening of the
relation. Y would be unwise to react by using the alternative strategy

’making attractive’, since that would make him extremely vulnerable.
given X’s adversarial orientation, and Y would be virtually forced to
retaliate with the same actions of binding.
Alternatively, X could choose ’making attractive’. He could invest in his
value to the partner by engaging in modest initial specific investments
(VXY i ). This would contribute to fastening: the partner becomes more
captive (CAPY ). This argument is also present in TCE. X may also
offer productive hostages in the form of information about his technology, for the purpose of helping Y to develop his competence. A particularly interesting form of doing this is to invite specialists from Y to
develop his competence. A particularly interesting form of doing this
is to invite specialists from Y for a stay at X’s facilities. This simultaneously yields improvement of Y’s monitoring of X (OOX I ). Conversely, X may supply specialists for a stay at Y, which increases X’s
monitoring of Y (OOY 1 >. The possible conflict between people ’qua
per-sona’ and their organizational roles presents a complication here.
People stationed at Y may establish personal bonds beyond the interest
of X. Their value for monitoring, for example, may become
void.
Y would be very unwise not to respond in the same fashion if he is
interested in developing the relation. He would thereby forego the
opportunity of a virtuous circle of mutual investment and the development of trust that promises to increase extrinsic, as well as intrinsic,
value. If he reacted with binding, then so would X, with the negative
results discussed above.
Note that the exchange of hostages in the form of information about
one’s technology carries the risk of spill-over (that is what makes it a
hostage). Some guarantees are then required that the partner will be
careful to control accidental spill-overs.
In view of uncertainty about propensities to opportunism, this build-up

of increased turbulence of technology and markets. If conditions are
turbulent, in the sense that there is much entry and exit of firms, relative
value is subject to shifts that may destabilize a relation. We have already
indicated the cost of adjustment, the inflexibility of formal contracts
and the greater relative attraction of trust, when changes in demands
upon the relation are to be expected. On the other hand, if trust is based
on close personal bonds, this can yield a conflict with organizational
roles and tasks, particularly when the relation needs to be stopped, and
replacement of personnel may be required. When technology progresses
to become more flexible, and enables differentiated production at low
costs of switching between products, the level of specificity of investments declines, resulting in lower switching costs and less need to control the hold-up risk. The first may destabilize a relation, and the latter
may stabilize it.
Some issues can best be studied with the help of game theory, in a loose
or formal way, and others by means of simulating the development of
the relation. In comparison to simulation, game theory is useful for its
analytical parsimony, but it leaves questions of how, and by what paths,
Nash equilibria may be reached. In repeated interaction, parameters are
likely to shift along the way, such as the build-up of trust and shifting
goals, and analysis by repeated games may be either unrealistic (not
taking into account such shifts) or no longer soluble analytically (cf.
Gilbert 1989). For the evolution of relations, it might be better to resort
to simulation, particularly if we want to investigate the robustness of
a strategy under different conditions, events and parameter shifts. The
problem with simulation is often that it generates too much complexity
in terms of numbers of potential parameter constellations. Perhaps the
two methods can be combined, with game theory to provide
benchmarks to give some order and direction to simulation to test how
Nash equilibria may be achieved. For practical purposes of the diause
