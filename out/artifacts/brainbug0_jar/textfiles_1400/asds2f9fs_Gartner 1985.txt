A Conceptual Framework for Describing 

the Phenomenon of New Venture Creation 

WILLIAM B. GARTNER
Georgetown University
A review of the entrepreneurship literature suggests that differences
among entrepreneurs and among their ventures are as great a s the
variation between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs and between
new firms a n d established firms. A framework for describing new
venture creation integrates four inajor perspectives in entrepreneurship: characteristics of the individual(s) who start the venture,
the organization which they create, the environment surrounding the
new venture. and the process by which the new venture is started.
The major thrust of most entrepreneurship
research has been to prove that entrepreneurs are
different from nonentrepreneurs (Brockhaus,
1980a, 1980b; Carland, Hoy, Boulton, & Carland,
1984; Collins & Moore, 1964; DeCarlo & Lyons,
1979; Hornaday & Aboud, 1971; Howell, 1972;
Komives, 1972; Litzinger, 1965; McClelland,
1961; McClelland & Winter, 1969; Palmer, 1971;
Schrier, 1975; Shapero, 1975) and that entrepreneurial firms are different from nonentrepreneurial firms (Collins & Moore, 1970; Cooper,
1979; Smith, 1967; Thorne & Ball, 1981). The
basic assumption underlying this research is that
all entrepreneurs and their new ventures are
much the same. The present paper suggests that
the differences among entrepreneurs and among
their ventures are much greater than one might
expect; in fact, the diversity may be larger than
the differences between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs and between entrepreneurial firms
and nonentrepreneurial firms. Once the diversity among entrepreneurs and their ventures is
rec:ogriized, the necessity for finding a way to
classify them becomes apparent. Groups sharing

similar characteristics must exist within the universe of entrepreneurs and their ventures. How
are these groups revealed? Many different characteristics have been employed in past research to
describe entrepreneurs and their ventures. Do the
characteristics themselves fall into groups? In
other words, does one subset of characteristics
describe a single aspect of new venture creation,
such as the environment surrounding the new
venture, or the features of the organization that
results?
This paper attempts to organize the many variables that have been used in past research to
describe entrepreneurs and their ventures into a
comprehensive framework. Far from being reductive, this new view of the entrepreneurship literature should provide valuable insights into the
process of new venture creation by showing it to
be a complex and multidimensional phenomenon. Once a clear retrospective analysis of
the literature is provided, future research can proceed on more solid footing. Instead of many different researchers palpating different parts of the
elephaqt and reaching reductive conclusions, at
least all will know the name, if not the nature, of
the beast with which they are dealing.
Much past research has been unidimensional.
focusing on a single aspect of new venture creation, and its main purpose has been to show how
entrepreneurs or their firms differ from nonentrepreneurs or nonentrepreneurial firms. (In fact,
it might be said that unidimensional research goes

<-----Page 2----->hand in hand with the attitude that all entrepreneurs and their firms are alike, the task of the
unidimensional research being to prove how all
things entrepreneurial differ from all things
nonentrepreneurial.) It has been consistently
pointed out, however, in reviews of literature on
entrepreneurs, for example, (Brockhaus, 1982;
Glueck & Mescon, 1980; McCain & Smith, 1981)
that variables that are assumed to differentiate
entrepreneurs from nonentrepreneurs (managers,
for instance) frequently do not bear up under
close scrutiny. Yet the search for these elusive
variables continues, and entrepreneurs and prospective entrepreneurs are subjected to batteries
of psychological tests in attempts to isolate the
single spring that makes them tick differently
from others. As with other aspects of new venture creation, attempts are made to isolate key
variables that separate entrepreneurial situations
from nonentrepreneurial ones. Pennings (1980,
1982a, 1982b) has explored environments that
support new venture creation; Van de Ven (1980)
and Kimberly (1979) have focused on the process of venture creation.
This search for key variables is a motivation
for research only if the task of entrepreneurial
research is taken to be the distinction of entrepreneurs and things entrepreneurial from nonentrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurial situations. If a
much different perspective is taken, the perspective that there are many different kinds of entrepreneur and many ways to be one and that the
firms they create vary enormously as do the environments they create them in, then the burden
shifts. How is each new venture creation different from another? Researchers need to think in
terms of a combination of variables that make up
each new venture creation (Van de Ven, Hudson,
& Schroeder, 1984). The creation of a new venture is a multidimensional phenomenon; each
variable describes only a single dimension of the
phenomenon and cannot be taken alone. There
is a growing awareness that the process of starting a business is not a single well-worn route
marched along again and again by identical entrepreneurs [Hartman, 1983). New venture creation
is a complex phenomenon: entrepreneurs and
their firms vary widely; the actions they take or
do not take and the environments they operate in
and respond to are equally diverse - and all these

elements form complex and unique combinations
in the creation of each new venture. It is not
enough for researchers to seek out and focus on
some concept of the "average" entrepreneur and
the "typical" venture creation. New organizational forms evolve through variation, and this
variation in new venture creation needs to be
studied (Aldrich, 1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1977;
Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Weick, 1979).This insistence on variation can be seen, for example, in
Vesper (1979), who posits 11 different kinds of
entrepreneur, and in a recent study by Cooper
and Dunkelberg (1981),which reveals that entrepreneurs in certain industries can be very different from those in other industries.
Once the variation and complexity in new venture creation is recognized, it then is necessary
to find a framework for systematically discovering and evaluating the similarities and differences
among new ventures (McKelvey, 1982). Once it
is no longer assumed that all entrepreneurs and
their ventures present a homogeneous population,
then other homogeneous subsets within the entrepreneurial universe must be sought out in order
that entrepreneurial research can produce meaningful results. A primary value of the framework
for describing new venture creation presented
here is that it provides a systematic means of
comparing and contrasting complex ventures; it
provides a way to conceptualize variation and
complexity.

A Framework for Describing 

New Venture Creation 

Definitions of key words such as entrepreneur
are often various and always a problem in the
study of entrepreneurship (Brockhaus, 1980b;
Komives, 1969; Long, 1983). Because the entrepreneur is only one dimension of this framework,
it seems more important in this paper to define
the term "new venture creation." Such a definition can be outlined here with less trepidation, if
only because there is less precedent.
New venture creation is the organizing (in the
Weickian sense) of new organizations. "To organize is to assemble ongoing interdependent actions into sensible sequences that generate sensible outcomes" (Weick, 1979, p. 3 ) . The definition of new venture creation is synonymous with

<-----Page 3----->the definition of the new organization developed
by the Strategic Planning Institute (1978, p. 1-2):
a nelv business venture launched as one of the
following:
1. an independent entity
2. 	 a new profit center within a company which
has other established businesses, or
3 , 	a joint venture which satisfies the following
criteria:
1. 	Its founders must acquire expertise in products, process, market andlor technology.
2. 	 Results are expected beyond the year in
which the investment is made.
3. 	It is ons side red a new market entrant by its
competitors.
4. 	It is regarded as a new source of supply by its
potential customers.

The importance of this definition should not be
overlooked, because it recognizes the multidimensional aspects of new venture creation. First,
it emphasizes that individuals with expertise are
a key element of the new venture. At the same
time that it recognizes the new venture as an
organizational entity, it stresses that the new venture is not instantaneously produced, but evolves
over time (beyond a year). The new venture is
seen further within the context of its environment: it is forced to seek out resources, and it
competes in the market place. All these aspects
of the new venture must be kept in mind if it is to
be adequately described and classified.
Figure 1 presents a framework for describing
the creation of a new venture across four dimensions: (a) individual(s)-the person(s) involved in
starting a new organization; (b)organization-the
kind of firm that is started; (c) environment-the
situation surrounding and influencing the new
organization; and (d) new venture process-the
actions undertaken by the individual(s) to start
the venture.
Any new venture is a gestalt (Miller, 1981) of
variables from the four dimensions. No new ven-

ture creation can be comprehensively described,
nor can its complexity be adequately accounted
for, unless all of its four dimensions are investigated and an attempt is made to discover how
variables from each dimension interact with variables from other dimensions.
This framework is the first to combine the four
dimensions of venture creation, though other
researchers have sought to combine two or more
of the dimensions. This "thinking across dimensions" is especially apparent in the work of those
theorists and researchers who have developed
entrepreneurial classification schemes. Classifications of entrepreneurs themselves are often
based on two dimensions: individual characteristics plus new venture process considerations the word often used is "style." Danhoff (1949)
based his scheme on the entrepreneur's openness to innovation; Cole (1959) on the sophistication of the entrepreneur's decision making tools;
and Dailey (1971) according to bureaucratic or
entrepreneurial style. Smith (1967) divided entrepreneurs by a stylistic orientation - craftsman or
opportunistic. Filley and Aldag (1980) used
management orientation. Vesper (1979, 1980) i n
two similar classifications differentiated among
entrepreneurs by the activities involved in business formation and operation, and in another
scheme (1980) by competitive strategy. In Cooper (1979) entrepreneurs are linked to particular
environments, and, as cited previously, Cooper
and Dunkelberg's (1981) study matches different
entrepreneurs and their characteristics to the
types of firms they are likely to start. In Vesper's
(1979) classification the entrepreneur's type of
firm is also a factor, as it is in several other
classification studies (Braden, 1977; Filley &
Aldag, 1980; Smith, 1967). Recently, Van de Ven
et al.'s (1984) empirical study examined educational software firms on the basis of three dimen-

characteristics and psychological attributes of the founding entrepreneurs; organizational-planning and
organizational activities undertaken before and
after company startup; and ecological-support
and resources made available to influence the
development of the industry. These classification schemes and frameworks are ways of stepping back to get an overall picture, a process like
model-building, which involves integration and
synthesis.

Individual(s)
Whether an entrepreneur is viewed as a "captain of industry," a hard-headed risk bearer (Mill,
1848), risk taker (Palmer, 1971) or a "rapacious
risk avoider" (Webster, 1976);whether he merely
metamorphoses into an entrepreneur at certain
moments and is something else the rest of the
time (Danhoff, 1949), or whether his need for
achievement (McClelland, 1961) and capacity for
innovation (Schumpeter, 1934) are always ticking away; whether he is a "displaced person"
(Shapero, 1975), something close to a juvenile
delinquent (Gould, 1969),or a "man apart" (Liles,
1974) with an absolutely clear-headed (veridical)
perception of reality (Schrage, 1965), an aberrant
"artist" with an "innate sense of impending
change" (Hill, 1982); or whether he is, indeed,
that completely political animal, a community
builder (Schell & Davig, 19811, the entrepreneur
is overwhelmingly perceived to be different in
important ways from the nonentrepreneur, and
many researchers have believed these differences
to lie in the background and personality of the
entrepreneur.
One often pursued avenue has been the attempt
to develop a psychological profile of the entrepreneur and to measure such psychological characteristics as need for achievement (DeCarlo &
Lyons, 1979; Hornaday & Aboud, 1971; McCleIland, 1961; McClelland & Winter, 1969;
Schwartz, 1976).However, other researchers have
not found need for achievement useful in describing entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1980b; Litzinger,
1965; Schrage, 1965);still others have questioned
the value and validity of using psychological
characteristics of any kind to describe entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1982; Glueck & Mescon,
1980; Jenks, 1965; Kilby, 1971; McCain & Smith,

1981; Van de Ven, 1980). However, the following
psychological characteristics have been used in
many studies and may have some validity in differentiating among types of entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1982):
1. Need for achievement
2. 	Locus of control
3. Risk taking propensity
Some researchers have found it fruitful to look
at the entrepreneur's background, experience, and
attitudes. Some individual characteristics that
may be of value in describing entrepreneurs are:
1. Job satisfaction (Collins & Moore, 1970; Komives, 1972)
2. 	 Previous work experience (Cooper, 1970; Lamont, 1972; Susbauer, 1972)
3. Entrepreneurial parents (Collins& Moore, 1970;
Roberts & Wainer, 1968;Schrier,1975; Secrest,
1975; Shapero, 1972; Susbauer, 1972)
4. 	 Age (Komives, 1972; Liles, 1974; Roberts &
Wainer, 1968; Secrest, 1975; Thorne & Ball,
1981)
5. 	Education (Brockhaus & Nord, 1979; Collins &
Moore, 1964; Howell, 1972; Roberts, 1969;
Susbauer, 1969)

Process
In 1949 Danhoff wrote, "Entrepreneurship is
an activity or function and not a specific individual or occupation . . . the specific personal entrepreneur is an unrealistic abstraction" (p. 21).
Other theorists have pursued this idea of function and have tried to differentiate the entrepreneurial function from other more routine
functions such as the managerial function (Baumol, 1968; Cole, 1965; Hartmann, 1959; Leibenstein, 1968; Schumpeter, 1934). This "dynamic"
aspect of the entrepreneur has been acknowledged in the work of eight researchers who have
enumerated certain actions that an entrepreneur
performs in order to create a new venture. Except
for Peterson and Berger (1971), who described
the entrepreneurial activities of record producers,
these studies were theoretical, that is, based on
general observation rather than systematic research. The similarities in their views are summarized here; six common behaviors are listed
(the order does not imply a sequence of actions):
1. The entrepreneur locates a business opportunity (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971; Maidique, 1980;
Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
2. 	The entrepreneur accumulates resources (Cole,
1965; Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein, 1968;Peterson &
Berger, 1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).

<-----Page 5----->3. The entrepreneur markets products and services (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein,
1968; Maidique, 1980; Peterson & Berger,
1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
4. 	T he entrepreneur produces the product (Kilby,
1971; Maidique, 1980; Peterson & Berger,
1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
5. The entrepreneur builds an organization (Cole,
1965; Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein, 1968; Schumpeter, 1934).
6. The entrepreneur responds to government and
society (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971).

Environment
Much of the current concern (Peters & Waterman, 1982) over how to design organizations that
keep and encourage innovative individuals is an
indirect acknowledgment that entrepreneurs do
not operate in vacuums - they respond to their
environments. The existence of highly supportive regional entrepreneurial environments
(Cooper, 1970; Draheim, 1972; Pennings, 1982b;
Susbauer, 1972) - including "incubator organizations''- can, from one perspective, be said actually to create entrepreneurs. The idea of "pushes"
and "pulls" from the environment has found its
way into many studies of entrepreneurship
(Shapero & Sokol, 1982).
In organization theory literature, two different
views of the environment have been developed.
One perspective, environmental determinism,
sees the environment as an outside set of conditions to which the organization must adapt
(Aldrich, 1979; Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Hannan
& Freeman, 1977). The other perspective, strategic choice, sees the environment as a "reality"
that organizations create via the selectivity of their
own perceptions (Child, 1972; Starbuck, 1976;
Weick, 1979). In the entrepreneurship literature,
both perspectives on the environment have been
taken. In the present paper those characteristics
that are viewed as relatively fixed conditions
imposed on the new venture from without are
called environmental variables. Variables over
which the organization has more control (strategic
choice variables) are more readily viewed as characteristics of the organization itself and are treated
as such.
In an overview of 1 7 research papers on environmental variables that influenced new venture
creation, Bruno and Tyebjee (1982) found 1 2 factors that they judged stimulated entrepreneurship:

I. 	V enture capital availability
2. 	Presence of experienced entrepreneurs

3. Technically skilled labor force
4. 	Accessibility of suppliers
5. Accessibility of customers or new markets
6. Governmental influences
7. Proximity of universities
8. Availability of land or facilities
9. 	Accessiblity of transportation
10. Attitude of the area population
11. Availability of supporting sewices
12. Living conditions

Another study of environmental influences on
new venture creation was Pennings' studies of
organization birth frequencies (1980, 1982a,
1982b). Pennings found that organization birth
rates were high in areas with: high occupational
and industrial differentiation; high percentages
of recent immigrants in the population; a large
industrial base; larger size urban areas; and availability of financial resources.
Another field of research has taken the deterministic perspective regarding the environment
and new ventures: industrial economics. Oliver
Williamson (1975) explored the process by which
the failure of markets to coordinate efficiently
the production and distribution of goods and services often resulted in the start-up of organizations to coordinate the production function
through administration. Porter (1980) focused on
the competitive environment that confronts firms
in a particular industry. Porter's work provides
five environmental influences on organizations:
barriers to entry, rivalry among existing competitors, pressure from substitute products, bargaining power of buyers, and bargaining power
of suppliers.
Organization
Despite a bold early attempt by Stauss (1944)
to direct the focus away from the entrepreneur
and toward his created organization (by claiming,
somewhat tortuously, that the firm is the entrepreneur), most subsequent studies of new venture creation have neglected to comment on or
even communicate certain characteristics of the
organizations on which they focused. The assumption behind this seems to derive from two
other assumptions: (a) if all entrepreneurs are
virtually alike and (b) they all go through the
same process to create their ventures, then (c)
the organizations they create must, like widgets,
not be of any interest in themselves.

<-----Page 6----->Many research samples in entrepreneurship
studies are selected, for example, without regard
to type of firm (i.e.,manufacturing, service, retail,
wholesale). Of the studies that have indicated
the type of firm, Smith (1967), Cooper (1970),
Collins and Moore (1970), Susbauer (1972), and
Braden (1977) studied manufacturing firms, and
most focused on high technology manufacturing
firms. Litzinger (1965) studied motel firms, and
Mescon and Montanari (1981) studied real estate
firms. However, researchers in these studies made
no attempts to compare the type of firm studied
to other types of firm to determine what difference type of firm might make in the process of
new venture creation. Cooper and Dunkelberg
(1981), Gartner (1982), and Van de Ven et al.
(1984) have begun to link type of firm across
other dimensions, such as entrepreneurial background and response to environment.
The presence of partners is another firm characteristic suggested by Timmons, Smollen, and
Dingee (1977) as a vital factor in starting certain
types of firm, and some research has mentioned
partners as a characteristic of the firms studied
(Cooper, 1970; DeCarlo & Lyons, 1979).
Strategic choice variables are treated here as
characteristics of the organization. Porter (1980)
identified three generic competitive strategies that
firms may "choose": (a) overall cost leadership,
(b) differentiation, and (c) focus. Vesper (1980)
identified 14 competitive entry wedges: the new
product or service, parallel competition, franchise
entry, geographical transfer, supply shortage, tapping unutilized resources, customer contract,
becoming a second source, joint ventures, licensing, market relinquishment, sell off of division, favored purchasing by government, and
governmental rule changes.

Conclusion
Listing each variable of new venture creation
under the appropriate dimension of the framework illustrates the potential for a high degree of
complexity in the interaction of these variables
within the multidimensional phenomenon of
venture creation (Figure 2).
The four dimensional conceptual framework
can be seen as a kaleidoscope, as an instrument
through which to view the enormously varying
patterns of new venture creation. Past attempts

to differentiate the typical entrepreneur and his1
her typical creation from all nonentrepreneurs
and all nonnew ventures have, whether intentionally or not, advanced the notion that all entrepreneurs are alike and all new venture creation
is the same. However, there clearly is a wide variation in the kinds of new ventures that are started.
For example, are there similarities between the
creation of a waterbed store by a 20-year old college student and the creation of a personal computer company by three engineers? Are the differences between them more important than the
similarities? What is the value of comparing the
creation of a pet store by two unemployed physical therapists to the creation of a 5,000-acre business park by four real estate developers? The goal
is not to smooth over any differences that might
exist among these new ventures or to throw these
very different individuals into the same pot in
order to extract the typical qualities of the typical entrepreneur. The goal is to identify the specific variables that describe how each new venture was created, in order that meaningful contrasts and comparisons among new ventures can
be made.
First must come careful description with an
eye to variation. The search for key variables, for
general principles, for universally applicable laws
of entrepreneurship that has characterized much
of the entrepreneurship literature betrays an
impatience with the slow methodical process of
description. Attention to careful observation and
description is the basis of good scientific research
(McKelvey, 1982). In what does all this careful
description of new ventures result? A collection
of uniquely described ventures, each different
from all the others? Once good description is
achieved, then good comparisons and contrasts
can be made, and subsets of similar ventures can
be established. These homogeneous populations
are needed before any general rules or theories of
new venture creation can be postulated. The lack
of such homogeneous samples in the past has led
to conflicts in the results of research studies.
The conceptual framework presented here provides a way of analyzing past research studies.
Each study can be broken down into the types of
individuals, organizations, environments, and
processes that were investigated. One way in
which the framework can be useful is in identify-

<-----Page 8----->ing those aspects of new venture creation neglected by a particular study. New research may
then be designed to account for these lacunae.
For example, Brockhaus defines his sample of
entrepreneurs as:
Individuals who within three months prior to the
study had ceased working for their employers and
at the time of the study owned as well as managed
business ventures. . . . The businesses whose owners served as participants were selected from the
listing of businesses licensed by St. Louis County,
Missouri during the months of August and September, 1975 (1980a, p. 39).

Although Brockhaus, unlike other researchers,
attempts to close in on the actual entrepreneurial
function by interviewing his entrepreneurs
within a few months of the creation of their
ventures, useful and necessary distinctions
among the individuals and their new ventures
are not made. One is not sure what types of firms
were studied (retail, service, manufacturing, etc.)
or whether the St. Louis environment was likely
to influence certain types of individuals to create
certain types of firms. Is the process of starting a
venture in St. Louis different, or is the process
different for certain types of businesses or certain kinds of individuals? Accounting for type of
firm, environment, and process in this study
would enhance comparison among the individuals in the study and individuals in other studies.
In analyzing results of research studies, a focus
on differences in one of the four dimensions
might explain conflicting results. For example,
studies such as Collins and Moore (1970) suggest
that individuals who start firms are social misfits
who do not fit into most organizations. Yet other
studies such as Cooper (1970) suggest that individuals who start successful firms are good team
players. On closer examination it is seen that
Collins and Moore studied manufacturing firms
that were more like job shops in the 1950s, and
Cooper studied high technology firms in the
1960s. High technology industries might require
more skills than one individual would be likely
to have, necessitating that individuals combine
their abilities in teams in order to start an organization successfully.
In addition to providing a means by which past
research can be analyzed, the framework outlines
a format for future research methodologies and
for reporting such research. More careful atten-

tion must be paid to the research sample. For
example, women entrepreneurs are a popular
research topic. If similarities are discovered
among women who start firms, are these similarities a result of similar environments? Can differences be attributed solely to psychological or
background characteristics? What is the value of
research results that are based on such unexamined and possibly heterogeneous sample populations?
Even in a narrowly selected research sample,
the framework might be useful in drawing the
researcher's attention to considerations inherent
in each of the four dimensions, in order that conclusions regarding the virtual sameness of all the
members of the sample may not be made too
hastily. For example, in a sample of new organizations in the micro-computer industry, a number of considerations might be made. Lj7hatis the
variation among the entrepreneurs in their work
backgrounds, education, age? How do competitive strategies used by these new organizations
vary? Are there regional or other subenvironments
in the industry that cause variations in firms and
strategies? What is the variation in the venture
creation process: do all individuals devote equal
time to financing the organization, hiring personnel, marketing? What differences exist between "new" and "old" firms in this industry?
The brief review of the literature provided earlier is only a running start at a comprehensive
analysis and evaluation of the entrepreneurship
literature. For example, in a study of individuals
who start firms, who are the individuals? Are the
individuals in McClelland's samples (McCelland,
1961; McCelland & Winter, 1969) similar to those
in Brockhaus (1980a) or Schrage (1965)? More
about the similarities and differences within and
among past research samples needs to be known.
There are many dimensions and variables across
which these samples may be compared.
The framework also points up the importance
of interactions of variables among dimensions in
understanding new venture creation. How does
an individual's background influence the type of
activities undertaken to start an organization?
Does the marketing individual devote his time to
marketing instead of manufacturing, and are there
some environments or firms that require more
marketing? Is the process of starting a retail store

<-----Page 9----->similar to that of starting a steel mill? Are entry
strategies used by new organizations in the robotics industry similar to those used in the brewery
industry?
The framework for describing new venture creation provides the possibility of describing subsets within the unwieldy set of all entrepreneurs
and all new ventures. Newly created ventures
that display meaningful similarities across the
four dimensions could be described and classified together (Gartner, 1982).Significant generalizations regarding some or all new venture creations might emerge, generalizations that do not,
however, attempt to mask the variation in new
venture creation.
This paper does not purport to answer specific

questions about how new ventures are started or
provide specific developmental models for new
venture creation. No claim is made that the framework or the list of variables is comprehensive;
the claim is only that the description of new ventures needs to be more comprehensive than it is
at present. A great many more questions are asked
here than are answered. However, the paper provides a means of making a fundamental shift in
the perspective on entrepreneurship: away from
viewing entrepreneurs and their ventures as an
unvarying, homogeneous population, and towards a recognition and appreciation of the complexity and variation that abounds in the phenomenon of new venture creation.
