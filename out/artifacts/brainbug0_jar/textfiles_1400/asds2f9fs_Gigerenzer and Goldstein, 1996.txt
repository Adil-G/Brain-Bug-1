Reasoning the Fast and Frugal Way: Models of Bounded Rationality

Humans and animals make inferences about the world under limited time and knowledge.In contrast, many models of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge,and computational might. FollowingH. Simon's notion of satisficing,the
authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: onereason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical
rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors
held a competition between the satisficing"Take The Best" algorithm and various "rational" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed
all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that cognitive
mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical
norms of rational inference.

Organisms make inductive inferences. Darwin ( 1872/1965 )
observed that people use facial cues, such as eyes that waver and
lids that hang low, to infer a person's guilt. Male toads, roaming
through swamps at night, use the pitch of a rival's croak to infer
its size when deciding whether to fight (Krebs & Davies, 1987).
Stock brokers must make fast decisions about which of several
stocks to trade or invest when only limited information is available. The list goes on. Inductive inferences are typically based
on uncertain cues: The eyes can deceive, and so can a tiny toad
with a deep croak in the darkness.
How does an organism make inferences about unknown aspects of the environment? There are three directions in which
to look for an answer. From Pierre Laplace to George Boole to
Jean Piaget, many scholars have defended the now classical view
that the laws of human inference are the laws of probability and
statistics (and to a lesser degree logic, which does not deal as
easily with uncertainty). Indeed, the Enlightenment probabilists derived the laws of probability from what they believed to
be the laws of human reasoning (Daston, 1988). Following this
time-honored tradition, much contemporary research in psychology, behavioral ecology, and economics assumes standard

statistical tools to be the normative and descriptive models of
inference and decision making. Multiple regression, for instance, is both the economist's universal tool (McCloskey,
1985 ) and a model of inductive inference in multiple-cue learning (Hammond, 1990) and clinical judgment (B. Brehmer,
1994); Bayes's theorem is a model of how animals infer the
presence of predators or prey (Stephens & Krebs, 1986) as well
as of human reasoning and memory (Anderson, 1990). This
Enlightenment view that probability theory and human reasoning are two sides of the same coin crumbled in the early nineteenth century but has remained strong in psychology and
economics.
In the past 25 years, this stronghold came under attack by
proponents of the heuristics and biases program, who concluded that human inference is systematically biased and error
prone, suggesting that the laws of inference are quick-and-dirty
heuristics and not the laws of probability (Kahneman, Slovic, &
Tversky, 1982). This second perspective appears diametrically
opposed to the classical rationality of the Enlightenment, but
this appearance is misleading. It has retained the normative
kernel of the classical view. For example, a discrepancy between
the dictates of classical rationality and actual reasoning is what
defines a reasoning error in this program. Both views accept the
laws of probability and statistics as normative, but they disagree
about whether humans can stand up to these norms.
Many experiments have been conducted to test the validity of
these two views, identifying a host of conditions under which
the human mind appears more rational or irrational. But most
of this work has dealt with simple situations, such as Bayesian
inference with binary hypotheses, one single piece of binary
data, and all the necessary information conveniently laid out
for the participant (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995). In many
real-world situations, however, there are multiple pieces of information, which are not independent, but redundant. Here,
Bayes's theorem and other "rational" algorithms quickly become mathematically complex and computationally intractable, at least for ordinary human minds. These situations make
neither of the two views look promising. If one would apply the
classical view to such complex real-world environments, this

would suggest that the mind is a supercalculator like a Laplacean Demon (Wimsatt, 1976 )---carrying around the collected
works of Kolmogoroff, Fisher, or Neyman--and simply needs a
memory jog, like the slave in Plato's Meno. On the other hand,
the heuristics-and-biases view of human irrationality would
lead us to believe that humans are hopelessly lost in the face of
real-world complexity, given their supposed inability to reason
according to the canon of classical rationality, even in simple
laboratory experiments.
There is a third way to look at inference, focusing on the psychological and ecological rather than on logic and probability
theory. This view questions classical rationality as a universal
norm and thereby questions the very definition of "good" reasoning on which both the Enlightenment and the heuristicsand-biases views were built. Herbert Simon, possibly the bestknown proponent of this third view, proposed looking for
models of bounded rationality instead of classical rationality.
Simon (1956, 1982) argued that information-processing systems typically need to satisfice rather than optimize. Satisficing,
a blend of sufficing and satisfying, is a word of Scottish origin,
which Simon uses to characterize algorithms that successfully
deal with conditions of limited time, knowledge, or computational capacities. His concept of satisficing postulates, for instance, that an organism would choose the first object (a mate,
perhaps) that satisfies its aspiration level--instead of the intractable sequence of taking the time to survey all possible alternatives, estimating probabilities and utilities for the possible outcomes associated with each alternative, calculating expected
utilities, and choosing the alternative that scores highest.
Let us stress that Simon's notion of bounded rationality has
two sides, one cognitive and one ecological. As early as in Administrative Behavior ( 1945 ), he emphasized the cognitive limitations of real minds as opposed to the omniscient Laplacean
Demons of classical rationality. As early as in his Psychological
Review article titled "Rational Choice and the Structure of the
Environment" (1956), Simon emphasized that minds are
adapted to real-world environments. The two go in tandem:
"Human rational behavior is shaped by a scissors whose two
blades are the structure of task environments and the computational capabilities of the actor" (Simon, 1990, p. 7). For the
most part, however, theories of human inference have focused
exclusively on the cognitive side, equating the notion of
bounded rationality with the statement that humans are limited
information processors, period. In a Procrustean-bed fashion,
bounded rationality became almost synonymous with heuristics and biases, thus paradoxically reassuring classical rationality as the normative standard for both biases and bounded rationality (for a discussion of this confusion see Lopes, 1992).
Simon's insight that the minds of living systems should be understood relative to the environment in which they evolved,
rather than to the tenets of classical rationality, has had little
impact so far in research on human inference. Simple psychological algorithms that were observed in human inference, reasoning, or decision making were often discredited without a fair
trial, because they looked so stupid by the norms of classical
rationality. For instance, when Keeney and Raiffa (1993) discussed the lexicographic ordering procedure they had observed
in practice--a procedure related to the class of satisficing algorithms we propose in this article--they concluded that this procedure "is naively simple" and "will rarely pass a test of

651

'reasonableness' " ( p . 78 ). They did not report such a test. We
shall.
Initially, the concept of bounded rationality was only vaguely
defined, often as that which is not classical economics, and one
could "fit a lot of things into it by foresight and hindsight," as
Simon ( 1992, p. 18) himself put it. We wish to do more than
oppose the Laplacean Demon view. We strive to come up with
something positive that could replace this unrealistic view of
mind. What are these simple, intelligent algorithms capable of
making near-optimal inferences? How fast and how accurate are
they? In this article, we propose a class of models that exhibit
bounded rationality in both of Simon's senses. These satisficing
algorithms operate with simple psychological principles that
satisfy the constraints of limited time, knowledge, and computational might, rather than those of classical rationality. At the
same time, they are designe d to be fast and frugal without a
significant loss of inferential accuracy, because the algorithms
can exploit the structure of environments.
The article is organized as follows. We begin by describing the
task the cognitive algorithms are designed to address, the basic
algorithm itself, and the real-world environment on which the
performance of the algorithm will be tested. Next, we report on
a competition in which a satisficing algorithm competes with
"rational" algorithms in making inferences about a real-world
environment. The "rational" algorithms start with an advantage: They use more time, information, and computational
might to make inferences. Finally, we study variants of the satisficing algorithm that make faster inferences and get by with
even less knowledge.
T h e Task
We deal with inferential tasks in which a choice must be made
between two alternatives on a quantitative dimension. Consider
the following example:
Which city has a larger population? (a) Hamburg (b) Cologne.
Two-alternative-choice tasks occur in various contexts in which
inferences need to be made with limited time and knowledge,
such as in decision making and risk assessment during driving
(e.g., exit the highway now or stay on ); treatment-allocation decisions (e.g., who to treat first in the emergency room: the 80year-old heart attack victim or the 16-year-old car accident
victim); and financial decisions (e.g., whether to buy or sell in
the trading pit). Inference concerning population demographics, such as city populations of the past, present, and future
(e.g., Brown & Siegler, 1993), is of importance to people working in urban planning, industrial development, and marketing.
Population demographics, which is better understood than, say,
the stock market, will serve us later as a "drosophila" environment that allows us to analyze the behavior of satisficing
algorithms.
We study two-alternative-choice tasks in situations where a
person has to make an inference based solely on knowledge retrieved from memory. We refer to this as inference from memory as opposed to inference from givens. Inference from memory involves search in declarative knowledge and has been investigated in studies of, inter alia, confidence in general
knowledge (e.g., Juslin, 1994; Sniezek & Buckley, 1993); the

<-----Page 2----->652

effect of repetition on belief (e.g., Hertwig, Gigerenzer, &
Hoffrage, in press); hindsight bias (e.g., Fischhoff, 1977); quantitative estimates of area and population of nations (Brown &
Siegler, 1993); and autobiographic memory of time
(Huttenlocher, Hedges, & Prohaska, 1988). Studies of inference from givens, on the other hand, involve making inferences
from information presented by an experimenter (e.g., Hammond, Hursch, & Todd, 1964). In the tradition of Ebbinghaus's
nonsense syllables, attempts are often made here to prevent individual knowledge from impacting on the results by using
problems about hypothetical referents instead o f actual ones.
For instance, in celebrated judgment and decision-making
tasks, such as the "cab" problem and the "Linda" problem, all
the relevant information is provided by the experimenter, and
individual knowledge about cabs and hit-and-run accidents, or
feminist bank tellers, is considered of no relevance (Gigerenzer
& Murray, 1987). As a consequence, limited knowledge or individual differences in knowledge play a small role in inference
from givens. In contrast, the satisflcing algorithms proposed in
this article perform inference from memory, they use limited
knowledge as input, and as we will show, they can actually profit
from a lack of knowledge.
Assume that a person does not know or cannot deduce the
answer to the Hamburg-Cologne question but needs to make
an inductive inference from related real-world knowledge. How
is this inference derived? How can we predict choice (Hamburg
or Cologne) from a person's state of knowledge?
Theory
The cognitive algorithms we propose are realizations of a
framework for modeling inferences from memory, the theory
of probabilistic mental models (PMM theory; see Gigerenzer,
1993; Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Kleinb61ting, 1991 ). The theory
of probabilistic mental models assumes that inferences about
unknown states of the world are based on probability cues
(Brunswik, 1955). The theory relates three visions: (a) Inductive inference needs to be studied with respect to natural environments, as emphasized by Brunswik and Simon; (b) inductive inference is carried out by satisficing algorithms, as emphasized by Simon; and (c) inductive inferences are based on
frequencies of events in a reference class, as proposed by Reichenbach and other frequentist statisticians. The theory of
probabilistic mental models accounts for choice and confidence, but only choice is addressed in this article.
The major thrust of the theory is that it replaces the canon of
classical rationality with simple, plausible psychological mechanisms of inference--mechanisms that a mind can actually
carry out under limited time and knowledge and that could have
possibly arisen through evolution. Most traditional models of
inference, from linear multiple regression models to Bayesian
models to neural networks, try to find some optimal integration
of all information available: Every bit of information is taken
into account, weighted, and combined in a computationally expensive way. The family of algorithms in P M M theory does not
implement this classical ideal. Search in memory for relevant
information is reduced to a minimum, and there is no integration (but rather a substitution) of pieces of information. These
satisficing algorithms dispense with the fiction of the omniscient Laplacean Demon, who has all the time and knowledge

Objects a, b, and c are recognized; object dis not. Cue values are positive (+) or negative ( - ) ; missing knowledge is shown by question
marks. Cues are ordered according to their validities. To infer whether
a > b, the Take The Best algorithm looks up only the cue values in the
shaded space; to infer whether b > c, search is bounded to the dotted
space. The other cue values are not looked up.

to search for all relevant information, to compute the weights
and covariances, and then to integrate all this information into
an inference.

Limited Knowledge
A PMM is an inductive device that uses limited knowledge to
make fast inferences. Different from mental models of syllogisms and deductive inference (Johnson-Laird, 1983), which
focus on the logical task of truth preservation and where knowledge is irrelevant (except for the meaning of connectives and
other logical terms), PMMs perform intelligent guesses about
unknown features of the world, based on uncertain indicators.
To make an inference about which of two objects, a or b, has a
higher value, knowledge about a reference class R is searched,
with a, b E R. In our example, knowledge about the reference
class "cities in Germany" could be searched. The knowledge
consists of probability cues Ci (i = 1 , . . . , n), and the cue values
ai and bi of the objects for the ith cue. For instance, when making inferences about populations of German cities, the fact that
a city has a professional soccer team in the major league
(Bundesliga) may come to a person's mind as a potential cue.
That is, when considering pairs of German cities, if one city has
a soccer team in the major league and the other does not, then
the city with the team is likely, but not certain, to have the larger
population.
Limited knowledge means that the matrix of objects by cues
has missing entries (i.e., objects, cues, or cue values may be
unknown). Figure 1 models the limited knowledge of a person.
She has heard of three German cities, a, b, and c, but not of
d (represented by three positive and one negative recognition
values). She knows some facts (cue values) about these cities
with respect to five binary cues. For a binary cue, there are two
cue values, positive (e.g., the city has a soccer team) or negative
(it does not). Positiverefers to a cue value that signals a higher
value on the target variable (e.g., having a soccer team is correlated with high population). Unknown cue values are shown by
a question mark. Because she has never heard of d, all cue values for object d are, by definition, unknown.
People rarely know all information on which an inference

<-----Page 3----->REASONING THE FAST AND FRUGAL WAY

653

could be based, that is, knowledge is limited. We model limited
knowledge in two respects: A person can have (a) incomplete
knowledge of the objects in the reference class (e.g., she recognizes only some of the cities ), (b) limited knowledge of the cue
values (facts about cities), or (c) both. For instance, a person
who does not know all of the cities with soccer teams may know
some cities with positive cue values (e.g., Munich and Hamburg
certainly have teams), many with negative cue values ( e.g., Heidelberg and Potsdam certainly do not have teams), and several
cities for which cue values will not be known.

The Take The Best Algorithm
The first satisficing algorithm presented is called the Take
The Best algorithm, because its policy is "take the best, ignore
the rest" It is the basic algorithm in the P M M framework. Variants that work faster or with less knowledge are described later.
We explain the steps of the Take The Best algorithm for binary
cues (the algorithm can be easily generalized to many valued
cues), using Figure 1 for illustration.
The Take The Best algorithm assumes a subjective rank order
of cues according to their validities (as in Figure 1 ). We call the
highest ranking cue (that discriminates between the two
alternatives) the best cue. The algorithm is shown in the form
of a flow diagram in Figure 2.

Figure 3. Discriminationrule. A cue discriminatesbetweentwo alternatives if one has a positive cue value and the other does not. The

four discriminating cases are shaded.

1 is asked to infer which of city a and city d has more inhabitants, the inference will be city a, because the person has never
heard of city d before.

Step 2: Search for Cue Values
For the two objects, retrieve the cue values of the highest
ranking cue from memory.

Step 1: Recognition Principle

Step 3."Discrimination Rule

The recognition principle is invoked when the mere recognition of an object is a predictor of the target variable (e.g.,
population). The recognition principle states the following: If
only one of the two objects is recognized, then choose the recognized object. If neither of the two objects is recognized, then
choose randomly between them. If both of the objects are recognized, then proceed to Step 2.
Example: I f a person in the knowledge state shown in Figure

Decide whether the cue discriminates. The cue is said to discriminate between two objects if one has a positive cue value
and the other does not. The four shaded knowledge states in
Figure 3 are those in which a cue discriminates.

Start

If the cue discriminates, then stop searching for cue values. If
the cue does not discriminate, go back to Step 2 and continue
with the next cue until a cue that discriminates is found.

Step 4: Cue-Substitution Principle

Flowdiagram of the TakeThe Bestalgorithm.

Choose the object with the positive cue value. If no cue discriminates, then choose randomly.
Examples: Suppose the task is judging which of city a or b is
larger (Figure 1). Both cities are recognized (Step 1 ), and
search for the best cue results with a positive and a negative cue
value for Cue 1 (Step 2). The cue discriminates (Step 3), and
search is terminated (Step 4). The person makes the inference
that city a is larger (Step 5 ).
Suppose now the task is judging which of city b or e is larger.
Both cities are recognized (Step 1 ), and search for the cue values cue results in negative cue value on object b for Cue 1, but
the corresponding cue value for object e is unknown (Step 2).
The cue does not discriminate (Step 3 ), so search is continued
(Step 4). Search for the next cue results with positive and a
negative cue values for Cue 2 (Step 2). This cue discriminates
(Step 3), and search is terminated (Step 4). The person makes
the inference that city b is larger (Step 5 ).
The features of this algorithm are (a) search extends through
only a portion of the total knowledge in memory (as shown by
the shaded and dotted parts of Figure 1 ) and is stopped imme-

<-----Page 4----->654

GIGERENZER AND GOLDSTEIN

diately when the first discriminating cue is found, (b) the algorithm does not attempt to integrate information but uses cue
substitution instead, and (c) the total amount of information
processed is contingent on each task (pair of objects) and varies
in a predictable way among individuals with different knowledge. This fast and computationally simple algorithm is a model
of bounded rationality rather than of classical rationality. There
is a close parallel with Simon's concept of "satisficing": The
Take The Best algorithm stops search after the first discriminating cue is found, just as Simon's satisficing algorithm stops
search after the first option that meets an aspiration level.
The algorithm is hardly a standard statistical tool for inductive inference: It does not use all available information, it is noncompensatory and nonlinear, and variants of it can violate transitivity. Thus, it differs from standard linear tools for inference
such as multiple regression, as well as from nonlinear neural
networks that are compensatory in nature. The Take The Best
algorithm is noncompensatory because only the best discriminating cue determines the inference or decision; no combination of other cue values can override this decision. In this way,
the algorithm does not conform to the classical economic view
of human behavior (e.g., Becker, 1976), where, under the assumption that all aspects can be reduced to one dimension (e.g.,
money), there exists always a trade-offbetween commodities or
pieces o f information. That is, the algorithm violates the Archimedian axiom, which implies that for any multidimensional
object a ( a j , a2 . . . . . a~) preferred to b (bl, b2 . . . . . b~), where
al dominates b~, this preference can be reversed by taking
multiples of any one or a combination of b2, b3 . . . . . bn. As we
discuss, variants of this algorithm also violate transitivity, one
of the cornerstones of classical rationality (McClennen, 1990).

E m p i r i c a l Evidence
Despite their flagrant violation of the traditional standards of
rationality, the Take The Best algorithm and other models from
the framework of PMM theory have been successful in integrating various striking phenomena in inference from memory and
predicting novel phenomena, such as the confidence-frequency
effect (Gigerenzer et al., 1991) and the less-is-more effect
(Goldstein, 1994; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1996). The theory
of probabilistic mental models seems to be the only existing
process theory of the overconfidence bias that successfully predicts conditions under which overestimation occurs, disappears,
and inverts to underestimation (Gigerenzer, 1993; Gigerenzer
et al., 1991; Juslin, 1993, 1994; Juslin, Winman, & Persson,
t995; but see Griffin & Tversk); 1992). Similarly, the theory
predicts when the hard-easy effect occurs, disappears, and invertswpredictions that have been experimentally confirmed by
Hoffrage (1994) and by Juslin ( 1993 ). The Take The Best algorithm explains also why the popular confirmation-bias explanation of the overconfidence bias (Koriat, Lichtenstein, &
Fischhoff, 1980) is not supported by experimental data
(Gigerenzer et al., 1991, pp. 521-522 ).
Unlike earlier accounts of these striking phenomena in confidence and choice, the algorithms in the P M M framework allow for predictions of choice based on each individual's knowledge. Goldstein and Gigerenzer (1996) showed that the recognition principle predicted individual participants" choices in
about 90% to 100% of all cases, even when participants were

taught information that suggested doing otherwise (negative
cue values for the recognized objects). Among the evidence for
the empirical validity of the Take-The-Best algorithm are the
tests of a bold prediction, the less-is-more effect, which postulates conditions under which people with little knowledge make
better inferences than those who know more. This surprising
prediction has been experimentally confirmed. For instance,
U.S. students make slightly more correct inferences about German city populations ( about which they know little) than about
U.S. cities, and vice versa for German students (Gigerenzer,
1993; Goldstein 1994; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1995; Hoffrage,
1994). The theory of probabilistic mental models has been applied to other situations in which inferences have to be made
under limited time and knowledge, such as rumor-based stock
market trading (DiFonzo, 1994). A general review of the theory
and its evidence is presented in McClelland and Bolger (1994).
The reader familiar with the original algorithm presented in
Gigerenzer et al. ( 1991 ) will have noticed that we simplified the
discrimination rule.~ In the present version, search is already
terminated if one object has a positive cue value and the other
does not, whereas in the earlier version, search was terminated
only when one object had a positive value and the other a negative one (cf. Figure 3 in Gigerenzer et al. with Figure 3 in this
article). This change follows empirical evidence that participants tend to use this faster, simpler discrimination rule
(Hoffrage, 1994).
This article does not attempt to provide further empirical evidence. For the moment, we assume that the model is descriptively valid and investigate how accurate this satisficing algorithm is in drawing inferences about unknown aspects of a
real-world environment. Can an algorithm based on simple
psychological principles that violate the norms of classical rationality make a fair number of accurate inferences?
The Environment
We tested the performance of the Take The Best algorithm on
how accurately it made inferences about a real-world environment. The environment was the set of all cities in Germany
with more than 100,000 inhabitants (83 cities after German
reunification), with population as the target variable. The
model of the environment consisted o f 9 binary ecological cues
and the actual 9 × 83 cue values. The full model of the environment is shown in the Appendix.
Each cue has an associated validity, which is indicative of its
predictive power. The ecological validity of a cue is the relative
frequency with which the cue correctly predicts the target, defined with respect to the reference class (e.g., all German cities
with more than 100,000 inhabitants). For instance, if one
checks all pairs in which one city has a soccer team but the other
city does not, one finds that in 87% of these cases, the city with
the team also has the higher population. This value is the ecological validity of the soccer team cue. The validity vi of the ith
cue is
v, = p[ t (a) > t (b) l ai is positive and b~ is negative ],

Also, we now use the term discrimination rule instead of activation

rule.

edge, time, and computational power. This question is important for Simon's postulated link between the cognitive and the
ecological: If the simple psychological principles in satisficing
algorithms are tuned to ecological structures, these algorithms
should not fail outright. We propose a competition between various inferential algorithms. The contest will go to the algorithm
that scores the highest proportion o f correct inferences in the

We simulated people with varying degrees of knowledge
about cities in Germany. Limited knowledge can take two
forms. One is limited recognition o f objects in the reference
class. The other is limited knowledge about the cue values o f
recognized objects. To model limited recognition knowledge,
we simulated people who recognized between 0 and 83 G e r m a n
cities. To model limited knowledge of cue values, we simulated
6 basic classes o f people, who knew 0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%,
or 100% of the cue values associated with the objects they recognized. Combining the two sources of limited knowledge resulted in 6 x 84 types of people, each having different degrees
and kinds o f limited knowledge. Within each type o f people, we
created 500 simulated individuals, who differed randomly from
one another in the particular objects and cue values they knew.
All objects and cue values known were determined randomly
within the appropriate constraints, that is, a certain n u m b e r o f
objects known, a certain total percentage o f cue values known,
and the validity o f the recognition principle (as explained in the
following paragraph).
The simulation needed to be realistic in the sense that the
simulated people could invoke the recognition principle. Therefore, the sets o f cities the simulated people knew had to be carefully chosen so that the recognized cities were larger than the
unrecognized ones a certain percentage o f the time. We performed a survey to get an empirical estimate o f the actual co-

where t(a) and t(b) are the values of objects a and b on the
target variable t and p is a probability measured as a relative
frequency in R .
The ecological validity o f the nine cues ranged over the whole
spectrum: from .51 (only slightly better than chance) to 1.0
(certainty), as shown in Table 1. A cue with a high ecological
validity, however, is not often useful if its discrimination rate is
small.
Table i shows also the discrimination rates for each cue. The
discrimination rate o f a cue is the relative frequency with which
the cue discriminates between any two objects from the reference class. The discrimination rate is a function o f the distribution o f the cue values and the n u m b e r N o f objects in the reference class. Let the relative frequencies of the positive and negative cue values be x and y, respectively. Then the discrimination
rate d~ of the ith cue is

as an elementary calculation shows. Thus, if N is very large,
the discrimination rate is approximately 2xiyi .2 The larger the
ecological validity of a cue, the better the inference. The larger
the discrimination rate, the more often a cue can be used to
make an inference. In the present environment, ecological validities and discrimination rates are negatively correlated. The
redundancy o f cues in the environment, as measured by pairwise correlations between cues, ranges between - . 2 5 and .54,
with an average absolute value of. 19. 3
The Competition
The question of how well a satisficing algorithm performs in
a real-world environment has rarely been posed in research on
inductive inference. The present simulations seem to be the first
to test how well simple satisficing algorithms do c o m p a r e d with
standard integration algorithms, which require more knowl-

2 For instance, if N = 2 and one cue value is positive and the other
negative (xr = Yr = .5), dr = 1.0. If Nincreases, with xr and Yi held
constant, then dr decreases and converges to 2xr Yr.
3 There are various other measures of redundancy besides pairwise
correlation. The important point is that whatever measure of redundancy one uses, the resultant value does not have the same meaning
for all algorithms. For instance, all that counts for the Take The Best
algorithm is what proportion of correct inferences the second cue adds
to the first in the cases where the first cue does not discriminate, how
much the third cue adds to the first two in the cases where they do not
discriminate, and so on. If a cue discriminates, search is terminated,
and the degree of redundancy in the cues that were not included in
the search is irrelevant. Integration algorithms, in contrast, integrate all
information and, thus, always work with the total redundancy in the
environment (or knowledge base). For instance, when deciding among
objects a, b, c, and din Figure 1, the cue values of Cues 3, 4, and 5 do
not matter from the point of view of the Take The Best algorithm
(because search is terminated before reaching Cue 3). However, the
values of Cues 3, 4, and 5 affect the redundancy of the ecological system,
from the point of view of all integration algorithms. The lesson is that
the degree of redundancy in an environment depends on the kind of
algorithm that operates on the environment. One needs to be cautious
in interpreting measures of redundancy without reference to an
algorithm.

variation between recognition of cities and city populations. Let
us define the validity c~ of the recognition principle to be the
probability; in a reference class, that one object has a greater
value on the target variable than another, in the cases where the
one object is recognized and the other is not:
a = p[ t (a) > t (b) t a, is positive and b, is negative ],
where t(a) and t(b) are the values of objects a and b on the
target variable t, a, and br are the recognition values of a and b,
and p is a probability measured as a relative frequency in R.
In a pilot study of 26 undergraduates at the University of Chicago, we found that the cities they recognized (within the 83
largest in Germany) were larger than the cities they did not recognize in about 80% of all possible comparisons. We incorporated this value into our simulations by choosing sets of cities
(for each knowledge state, i.e., for each number of cities
recognized) where the known cities were larger than the unknown cities in about 80% of all cases. Thus, the cities known
by the simulated individuals had the same relationship between
recognition and population as did those of the human individuals. Let us first look at the performance of the Take The Best
algorithm.

Testing the Take The Best Algorithm ~
We tested how well individuals using the Take The Best algorithm did at answering real-world questions such as, Which city
has more inhabitants: (a) Heidelberg or (b) Bonn? Each of the
500 simulated individuals in each of the 6 X 84 types was tested
on the exhaustive set of 3,403 city pairs, resulting in a total of
500 x 6 X 84 x 3,403 tests, that is, about 858 million.
The curves in Figure 4 show the average proportion of correct
inferences for each proportion of objects and cue values known.
The x axis represents the number of cities recognized, and the y
axis shows the proportion of correct inferences that the Take
The Best algorithm drew. Each of the 6 x 84 points that make
up the six curves is an average proportion of correct inferences
taken from 500 simulated individuals, who each made 3,403
inferences.
When the proportion of cities recognized was zero, the proportion of correct inferences was at chance level (.5). When up
to half of all cities were recognized, performance increased at
all levels of knowledge about cue values. The maximum percentage of correct inferences was around 77%. The striking result was that this maximum was not achieved when individuals
knew all cue values of all cities, but rather when they knew less.
This result shows the ability of the algorithm to exploit limited
knowledge, that is, to do best when not everything is known.
Thus, the Take The Best algorithm produces the less-is-more
effect. At any level of limited knowledge of cue values, learning
more German cities will eventually cause a decrease in proportion correct. Take, for instance, the curve where 75% of the cue
values were known and the point where the simulated participants recognized about 60 German cities. If these individuals
learned about the remaining German cities, their proportion
correct would decrease. The rationale behind the less-is-more
effect is the recognition principle, and it can be understood best
from the curve that reflects 0% of total cue values known. Here,
all decisions are made on the basis of the recognition principle,

Figure 4. Correct inferences about the population of German cities
(two-alternative-choice tasks) by the Take The Best algorithm. Inferences are based on actual information about the 83 largest cities and
nine cues for population (see the Appendix). Limited knowledgeof the
simulated individuals is varied across two dimensions: (a) the number
of cities recognized(x axis ) and (b) the percentage of cue values known
(the six curves).

or by guessing. On this curve, the recognition principle comes
into play most when half of the cities are known, so it takes
on an inverted-U shape. When half the cities are known, the
recognition principle can be activated most often, that is, for
roughly 50% of the questions. Because we set the recognition
validity in advance, 80% of these inferences will be correct. In
the remaining half of the questions, when recognition cannot
be used (either both cities are recognized or both cities are
unrecognized), then the organism is forced to guess and only
50% of the guesses will be correct. Using the 80% effective recognition validity half of the time and guessing the other half of
the time, the organism scores 65% correct, which is the peak of
the bottom curve. The mode of this curve moves to the right
with increasing knowledge about cue values. Note that even
when a person knows everything, all cue values of all cities,
there are states of limited knowledge in which the person would
make more accurate inferences. We are not going to discuss
the conditions of this counterintuitive effect and the supporting
experimental evidence here (see Goldstein & Gigerenzer,
1996). Our focus is on how much better integration algorithms
can do in making inferences.

Integration Algorithms
We asked several colleagues in the fields of statistics and economics to devise decision algorithms that would do better than
the Take The Best algorithm. The five integration algorithms
we simulated and pitted against the Take The Best algorithm in
a competition were among those suggested by our colleagues.

<-----Page 7----->REASONING THE FAST AND FRUGAL WAY
These competitors include "proper" and "improper" linear
models (Dawes, 1979; Lovie & Lovie, 1986). These algorithms,
in contrast to the Take The Best algorithm, embody two classical principles of rational inference: (a) complete search--they
use all available information (cue values ) - - a n d (b) complete
integration--they combine all these pieces of information into
a single value. In short, we refer in this article to algorithms
that satisfy these principles as "rational" (in quotation marks)
algorithms.

Contestant 1: Tallying
Let us start with a simple integration algorithm: tallying of
positive evidence (Goldstein, 1994). In this algorithm, the
number of positive cue values for each object is tallied across all
cues (i = 1 , . . . , n), and the object with the largest number
of positive cue values is chosen. Integration algorithms are not
based (at least explicitly) on the recognition principle. For this
reason, and to make the integration algorithms as strong as possible, we allow all the integration algorithms to make use of recognition information (the positive and negative recognition values, see Figure 1 ). Integration algorithms treat recognition as
a cue, like the nine ecological cues in Table 1. That is, in the
competition, the number of cues (n) is thus equal to 10
(because recognition is included). The decision criterion for
tallying is the following:

b~, then choose city a.

If ~ a~ >
i=1

i=1

i=1

Note that weighted tallying needs more information than either
tallying or the Take The Best algorithm, namely, quantitative
information about ecological validities. In the simulation, we
provided the real ecological validities to give this algorithm a
good chance.
Calling again on the comparison of objects a and b from Figure 1, let us assume that the validities would be .8 for recognition and .9, .8, .7, .6, .51 for Cues 1 through 5. Weighted tallying
would thus assign 1.7 points to a and 2.3 points to b. Thus,
weighted tallying would also choose b to be the larger.
Both tallying algorithms treat negative information and missing information identically. That is, they consider only positive
evidence. The following algorithms distinguish between negative and missing information and integrate both positive and
negative in formation.

Contestant 3. Unit- Weight L i n e a r M o d e l
The unit-weight linear model is a special case of the equalweight linear model (Huber, 1989) and has been advocated as a
good approximation of weighted linear models (Dawes, 1979;
Einhorn & Hogarth, 1975). The decision criterion for unitweight integration is the same as for tallying, only the assignment ofa~ and bi differs:
1 if the ith cue value is positive

bi, then guess.
i=l

The assignments of ai and b~ are the following:
1 if the ith cue value is positive
a~, b~ =

If Z aivi > ~, bivi, then choose city a.

iffil

If ~ ai =
i=l

657

0 if the ith cue value is negative
0 if the ith cue value is unknown.

Let us compare cities a and b, from Figure 1. By tallying the
positive cue values, a would score 2 points and b would score 3.
Thus, tallying would choose b to be the larger, in opposition to
the Take The Best algorithm, which would infer that a is larger.
Variants of tallying, such as the frequency-of-good-features
heuristic, have been discussed in the decision literature (Alba &
Marmorstein, 1987; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993).

Contestant 2. Weighted Tallying
Tallying treats all cues alike, independent of cue validity.
Weighted tallying of positive evidence is identical with tallying,
except that it weights each cue according to its ecological validity, vt. The ecological validities of the cues appear in Table 1.
We set the validity of the recognition cue to .8, which is the
empirical average determined by the pilot study. The decision
rule is as follows:

ai, b~ =

- 1 if the ith cue value is negative
0 if the ith cue value is unknown.

Comparing objects a and b from Figure 1 would involve assigning 1.0 points to a and 1.0 points to b and, thus, choosing
randomly. This simple linear model corresponds to Model 2 in
Einhorn and Hogarth ( 1975, p. 177 ) with the weight parameter
set equal to 1.

Contestant 4: Weighted Linear M o d e l
This model is like the unit-weight linear model except that
the values ofai and bi are multiplied by their respective ecological validities. The decision criterion is the same as with
weighted tallying. The weighted linear model (or some variant
of it) is often viewed as an optimal rule for preferential choice,
under the idealization of independent dimensions or cues (e.g.,
Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; Payne et al., 1993). Comparing objects
a and b from Figure 1 would involve assigning 1.0 points to a
and 0.8 points to b and, thus, choosing a to be the larger.

Contestant 5: Multiple Regression
The weighted linear model reflects the different validities of
the cues, but not the dependencies between cues. Multiple regression creates weights that reflect the covariances between

<-----Page 8----->658

GIGERENZER AND GOLDSTEIN

predictors or cues and is commonly seen as an "optimal" way
to integrate various pieces of information into an estimate (e.g.,
Brunswik, 1955; Hammond, 1966). Neural networks using the
delta rule determine their "optimal" weights by the same principles as multiple regression does (Stone, 1986). The delta rule
carries out the equivalent of a multiple linear regression from
the input patterns to the targets.
The weights for the multiple regression could simply be calculated from the full information about the nine. ecological
cues, as given in the Appendix. To make multiple regression an
even stronger competitor, we also provided information about
which cities the simulated individuals recognized. Thus, the
multiple regression used nine ecological cues and the recognition cue to generate its weights. Because the weights for the recognition cue depend on which cities are recognized, we calculated 6 × 500 × 84 sets of weights: one for each simulated individual. Unlike any of the other algorithms, regression had
access to the actual city populations (even for those cities not
recognized by the hypothetical person) in the calculation of the
weights. 4 During the quiz, each simulated person used the set of
weights provided to it by multiple regression to estimate the
populations of the cities in the comparison.
There was a missing-values problem in computing these 6 X
84 × 500 sets of regression coefficients, because most simulated
individuals did not know certain cue values, for instance, the
cue values of the cities they did not recognize. We strengthened
the performance of multiple regression by substituting unknown cue values with the average of the cue values the person
knew for the given cue. 5 This was done both in creating the
weights and in using these weights to estimate populations. Unlike traditional procedures where weights are estimated from
one half of the data, and inferences based on these weights are
made for the other half, the regression algorithm had access to
all the information in the Appendix (except, of course, the unknown cue values)--more information than was given to any
of the competitors. In the competition, multiple regression and,
to a lesser degree, the weighted linear model approximate the
ideal of the Laplacean Demon.

Results
Speed
The Take The Best algorithm is designed to enable quick decision making. Compared with the integration algorithms, how
much faster does it draw inferences, measured by the amount
of information searched in memory? For instance, in Figure
1, the Take The Best algorithm would look up four cue values
(including the recognition cue values) to infer that a is larger
than b. None of the integration algorithms use limited search;
thus, they always look up all cue values.
Figure 5 shows the amount of cue values retrieved from
memory by the Take The Best algorithm for various levels of
limited knowledge. The Take The Best algorithm reduces
search in memory considerably. Depending on the knowledge
state, this algorithm needed to search for between 2 (the number of recognition values) and 20 (the maximum possible cue
values: Each city has nine cue values and one recognition
value). For instance, when a person recognized half of the cities
and knew 50% of their cue values, then, on average, only about

4 cue values (that is, one fifth of all possible) are searched for.
The average across all simulated participants was 5.9, which was
less than a third of all available cue values.

Accuracy
Given that it searches only for a limited amount of information, how accurate is the Take The Best algorithm, compared
with the integration algorithms? We ran the competition for all
states of limited knowledge shown in Figure 4. We first report
the results of the competition in the case where each algorithm
achieved its best performance: When 100% of the cue values
were known. Figure 6 shows the results of the simulations, carried out in the same way as those in Figure 4.
To our surprise, the Take The Best algorithm drew as many
correct inferences as any of the other algorithms, and more than
some. The curves for Take The Best, multiple regression,
weighted tallying, and tallying are so similar that there are only
slight differences among them. Weighted tallying performed
about as well as tallying, and the unit-weight linear model performed about as well as the weighted linear model--demonstrating that the previous finding that weights may be chosen in
a fairly arbitrary manner, as long as they have the correct sign
( Dawes, 1979), is generalizable to tallying. The two integration
algorithms that make use of both positive and negative information, unit-weight and weighted linear models, made considerably fewer correct inferences. By looking at the lower-left and
upper-right corners of Figure 6, one can see that all competitors
do equally well with a complete lack of knowledge or with complete knowledge. They differ when knowledge is limited. Note
that some algorithms can make more correct inferences when
they do not have complete knowledge: a demonstration of the
less-is-more effect mentioned earlier.
What was the result of the competition across all levels of
limited knowledge? Table 2 shows the result for each level of
limited knowledge of cue values, averaged across all levels of
recognition knowledge. (Table 2 reports also the performance
of two variants of the Take The Best algorithm, which we discuss later: the Minimalist and the Take The Last algorithm.)
The values in the 100% column of Table 2 are the values in
Figure 6 averaged across all levels of recognition. The Take The
Best algorithm made as many correct inferences as one of the
competitors (weighted tallying) and more than the others. Because it was also the fastest, we judged the competition goes to
the Take The Best algorithm as the highest performing, overall.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that it has been demonstrated that a satisficing algorithm, that is, the Take The Best
algorithm, can draw as many correct inferences about a real-

4 We cannot claim that these integration algorithms are the best ones,
nor can we know a priori which small variations will succeed in our
bumpy real-worldenvironment. An example: During the proof stage of
this article we learned that regressing on the ranks of the cities does
slightly better than regressing on the city populations. The key issue is
what are the structures of environments in which particular algorithms
and variants thrive.
5 If no singlecue value was known for a given cue, the missing values
were substituted by .5. This value was chosen because it is the midpoint
of 0 and 1, which are the values used to stand for negativeand positive
cue values, respectively.

world environment as integration algorithms, across all states
of limited knowledge. The dictates of classical rationality would
have led one to expect the integration algorithms to do substantially better than the satisficing algorithm.
Two results of the simulation can be derived analytically. First
and most obvious is that if knowledge about objects is zero,
then all algorithms perform at a chance level. Second, and less
obvious, is that if all objects and cue values are known, then
tallying produces as many correct inferences as the unit-weight
linear model. This is because, under complete knowledge, the
score under the tallying algorithm is an increasing linear function of the score arrived at in the unit-weight linear model. 6
The equivalence between tallying and unit-weight linear models
under complete knowledge is an important result. It is known
that unit-weight linear models can sometimes perform about as
well as proper linear models (i.e., models with weights that are
chosen in an optimal way, such as in multiple regression; see
Dawes, 1979). The equivalence implies that under complete
knowledge, merely counting pieces of positive evidence can
work as well as proper linear models. This result clarifies one
condition under which searching only for positive evidence, a
strategy that has sometimes been labeled confirmation bias or
positive test strategy, can be a reasonable and efficient inferential strategy (Klayman & Ha, 1987; Tweney & Walker, 1990).
Why do the unit-weight and weighted linear models perform
markedly worse under limited knowledge of objects? The reason is the simple and bold recognition principle. Algorithms
that do not exploit the recognition principle in environments
where recognition is strongly correlated with the target variable
pay the price of a considerable number of wrong inferences. The
unit-weight and weighted linear models use recognition information and integrate it with all other information but do not
follow the recognition principle, that is, they sometimes choose
unrecognized cities over recognized ones. Why is this? In the
environment, there are more negative cue values than positive
ones (see the Appendix), and most cities have more negative
cue values than positive ones. From this it follows that when a
recognized object is compared with an unrecognized object, the
(weighted) sum of cue values of the recognized object will often
be smaller than that of the unrecognized object (which is - 1 for

the unit-weight model and - . 8 for the weighted linear model).
Here the unit-weight and weighted linear models often make
the inference that the unrecognized object is the larger one, due
to the overwhelming negative evidence for the recognized object. Such inferences contradict the recognition principle. Tallying algorithms, in contrast, have the recognition principle
built in implicitly. Because tallying algorithms ignore negative
information, the tally for an unrecognized object is always 0
and, thus, is always smaller than the tally for a recognized object, which is at least 1 (for tallying, or .8 for weighted tallying,
due to the positive value on the recognition cue). Thus, tallying
algorithms always arrive at the inference that a recognized object is larger than an unrecognized one.
Note that this explanation of the different performances puts
the full weight in a psychological principle (the recognition
principle) explicit in the Take The Best algorithm, as opposed
to the statistical issue of how to find optimal weights in a linear
function. To test this explanation, we reran the simulations for
the unit-weight and weighted linear models under the same conditions but replacing the recognition cue with the recognition
principle. The simulation showed that the recognition principle
accounts for all the difference.
C a n Satisficing A l g o r i t h m s G e t b y W i t h Even Less
T i m e a n d Knowledge?
The Take The Best algorithm produced a surprisingly high
proportion of correct inferences, compared with more computationally expensive integration algorithms. Making correct inferences despite limited knowledge is an important adaptive
feature of an algorithm, but being right is not the only thing
that counts. In many situations, time is limited, and acting fast
can be as important as being correct. For instance, if you are
driving on an unfamiliar highway and you have to decide in an
instant what to do when the road forks, your problem is not
necessarily making the best choice, but simply making a quick
choice. Pressure to be quick is also characteristic for certain
types of verbal interactions, such as press conferences, in which
a fast answer indicates competence, or commercial interactions,
such as having telephone service installed, where the customer
has to decide in a few minutes which of a dozen calling features
to purchase. These situations entail the dual constraints of limited knowledge and limited time. The Take The Best algorithm
is already faster than any of the integration algorithms, because
it performs only a limited search and does not need to compute
weighted sums of cue values. Can it be made even faster? It can,
if search is guided by the recency of cues in memory rather than
by cue validity.
The Take The L a s t A l g o r i t h m
The Take The Last algorithm first tries the cue that discriminated the last time. If this cue does not discriminate, the algo6 The proof for this is as follows.The tallying score t for a givenobject
is the number n ÷ of positive cue values, as defined above. The score u
for the unit weight linear model is n + - n-, where n- is the number of
negative cue values. Under complete knowledge,n = n + + n-, where n
is the number of cues. Thus, t = n +, and u = n + - n-. Because n- = n
n 4, by substitution into the formula for u, we find that u = n + - ( n n +) = 2t - n.
-

<-----Page 11----->REASONING THE FAST AND FRUGAL WAY
rithm then tries the cue that discriminated the time before last,
and so on. The algorithm differs from the Take The Best algorithm in Step 2, which is now reformulated as Step 2':

Step 2': Search for the Cue Values of the
Most Recent Cue
For the two objects, retrieve the cue values of the cue used
most recently. If it is the first judgment and there is no discrimination record available, retrieve the cue values of a randomly
chosen cue.
Thus, in Step 4, the algorithm goes back to Step 2'. Variants
of this search principle have been studied as the "Einstellung
effect" in the water jar experiments (Luchins & Luchins,
1994), where the solution strategy of the most recently solved
problem is tried first on the subsequent problem. This effect
has also been noted in physicians' generation of diagnoses for
clinical cases (Weber, B6ckenholt, Hilton, & Wallace, 1993 ).
This algorithm does not need a rank order of cues according
to their validities; all that needs to be known is the direction
in which a cue points. Knowledge about the rank order of cue
validities is replaced by a memory of which cues were last used.
Note that such a record can be built up independently of any
knowledge about the structure of an environment and neither
needs, nor uses, any feedback about whether inferences are
right or wrong.

The Minimalist Algorithm
Can reasonably accurate inferences be achieved with even
less knowledge? What we call the Minimalist algorithm needs
neither information about the rank ordering of cue validities
nor the discrimination history of the cues. In its ignorance, the
algorithm picks cues in a random order. The algorithm differs
from the Take The Best algorithm in Step 2, which is now reformulated as Step 2":

Step 2": Random Search
For the two objects, retrieve the cue values of a randomly
chosen cue.
The Minimalist algorithm does not necessarily speed up
search, but it tries to get by with even less knowledge than any
other algorithm.

Results
Speed
How fast are the fast algorithms? The simulations showed
that for each of the two variant algorithms, the relationship between amount of knowledge and the number of cue values
looked up had the same form as for the Take The Best algorithm
(Figure 5). That is, unlike the integration algorithms, the
curves are concave and the number of cues searched for is maximal when knowledge of cue values is lowest. The average number of cue values looked up was lowest for the Take The Last
algorithm (5.29) followed by the Minimalist algorithm (5.64)
and the Take The Best algorithm (5.91). As knowledge becomes more and more limited (on both dimensions: recognition and cue values known), the difference in speed becomes

661

smaller and smaller. The reason why the Minimalist algorithm
looks up fewer cue values than the Take The Best algorithm is
that cue validities and cue discrimination rates are negatively
correlated (Table 1 ); therefore, randomly chosen cues tend to
have larger discrimination rates than cues chosen by cue
validity.

Accuracy
What is the price to be paid for speeding up search or reducing the knowledge of cue orderings and discrimination histories
to nothing? We tested the performance of the two algorithms on
the same environment as all other algorithms. Figure 7 shows
the proportion of correct inferences that the Minimalist algorithm achieved. For comparison, the performance of the Take
The Best algorithm with 100% of cue values known is indicated
by a dotted line. Note that the Minimalist algorithm performed
surprisingly well. The maximum difference appeared when
knowledge was complete and all cities were recognized. In these
circumstances, the Minimalist algorithm did about 4 percentage points worse than the Take The Best algorithm. On average,
the proportion of correct inferences was only 1.1 percentage
points less than the best algorithms in the competition (Table 2).
The performance of the Take The Last algorithm is similar to
Figure 7, and the average number of correct inferences is shown
in Table 2. The Take The Last algorithm was faster but scored
slightly less than the Minimalist algorithm. The Take The Last
algorithm has an interesting ability, which fooled us in an earlier
series of tests, where we used a systematic (as opposed to a random) method for presenting the test pairs, starting with the
largest city and pairing it with all others, and so on. An integration algorithm such as multiple regression cannot "find out"
that it is being tested in this systematic way, and its inferences
are accordingly independent of the sequence of presentation.
However, the Take The Last algorithm found out and won this
first round of the competition, outperforming the other competitors by some 10 percentage points. How did it exploit systematic testing? Recall that it tries, first, the cue that discriminated the last time. If this cue does not discriminate, it proceeds
with the cue that discriminated the time before, and so on. In
doing so, when testing is systematic in the way described, it
tends to find, for each city that is being paired with all smaller
ones, the group of cues for which the larger city has a positive
value. Trying these cues first increases the chances of finding a
discriminating cue that points in the right direction (toward the
larger city). We learned our lesson and reran the whole competition with randomly ordered of pairs of cities.
Discussion
The competition showed a surprising result: The Take The
Best algorithm drew as many correct inferences about unknown features of a real-world environment as any of the integration algorithms, and more than some of them. Two further
simplifications of the algorithm--the Take The Last algorithm
(replacing knowledge about the rank orders of cue validities by
a memory of the discrimination history of cues) and the Minimalist algorithm (dispensing with both) showed a compara-

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first inference competition between satisficing and "rational" algorithms in a realworld environment. The result is of importance for encouraging
research that focuses on the power of simple psychological
mechanisms, that is, on the design and testing of satisficing algorithms. The result is also of importance as an existence proof
that cognitive algorithms capable of successful performance in
a real-world environment do not need to satisfy the classical
norms of rational inference. The classical norms may be sufficient but are not necessary for good inference in real
environments.

Cognitive Algorithms That Satisfice
In this section, we discuss the fundamental psychological
mechanism postulated by the PMM family of algorithms: onereason decision making. We discuss how this mechanism exploits the structure of environments in making fast inferences
that differ from those arising from standard models of rational
reasoning.

One-Reason Decision Making
What we call one-reason decision making is a specific form of
satisficing. The inference, or decision, is based on a single, good
reason. There is no compensation between cues. One-reason
decision making is probably the most challenging feature of the

PMM family of algorithms. As we mentioned before, it is a design feature of an algorithm that is not present in those models
that depict human inference as an optimal integration of all information available (implying that all information has been
looked up in the first place), including linear multiple regression and nonlinear neural networks. One-reason decision making means that each choice is based exclusively on one reason
(i.e., cue), but this reason may be different from decision to
decision. This allows for highly context-sensitive modeling of
choice. One-reason decision making is not compensatory. Compensation is, after all, the cornerstone of classical rationality,
assuming that all commodities can be compared and everything
has its price. Compensation assumes commensurability. However, human minds do not trade everything, some things are
supposed to be without a price (Elster, 1979). For instance, ifa
person must choose between two actions that might help him or
her get out of deep financial trouble, and one involves killing
someone, then no amount of money or other benefits might
compensate for the prospect of bloody hands. He or she takes
the action that does not involve killing a person, whatever other
differences exist between the two options. More generally, hierarchies of ethical and moral values are often noncompensatory:
True friendship, military honors, and doctorates are supposed
to be without a price.
Noncompensatory inference algorithms--such as lexicographic, conjunctive, and disjunctive rules--have been discussed in the literature, and some empirical evidence has been
reported (e.g., Einhorn, 1970; Fishburn, 1988). The closest rel-

<-----Page 13----->REASONING THE FAST AND FRUGAL WAY
ative to the PMM family of satisficing algorithms is the lexicographic rule. The largest evidence for lexicographic processes
seems to come from studies on decision under risk (for a recent
summary, see Lopes, 1995). However, despite empirical evidence, noncompensatory lexicographic algorithms have often
been dismissed at face value because they violate the tenets of
classical rationality (Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; Lovie & Lovie,
1986). The P M M family is both more general and more specific
than the lexicographic rule. It is more general because only the
Take The Best algorithm uses a lexicographic procedure in
which cues are ordered according to their validity, whereas the
variant algorithms do not. It is more specific, because several
other psychological principles are integrated with the lexicographic rule in the Take The Best algorithm, such as the recognition principle and the rules for confidence judgment (which
are not dealt with in this article; see Gigerenzer et al., 1991 ).
Serious models that comprise noncompensatory inferences
are hard to find. One of the few examples is in Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone ( 1993 ), who reported a simple, noncompensatory algorithm with only 3 binary, ordered cues,
which classified heart attack patients into high- and low-risk
groups and was more accurate than standard statistical classification methods that used up to 19 variables. The practical relevance of this noncompensatory classification algorithm is obvious: In the emergency room, the physician can quickly obtain
the measures on one, two, or three variables and does not need
to perform any computations because there is no integration.
This group of statisticians constructed satisficing algorithms
that approach the task of classification (and estimation) much
like the Take The Best algorithm handles two-alternative
choice. Relevance theory (Sperber, Cara, & Girotto, 1995 ) postulates that people generate consequences from rules according
to accessibility and stop this process when expectations of relevance are met. Although relevance theory has not been as formalized, we see its stopping rule as parallel to that of the Take
The Best algorithm. Finally, optimality theory (Legendre, Raymond, & Smolensky, 1993; Prince & Smolensky, 1991) proposes that hierarchical noncompensation explains how the
grammar of a language determines which structural description
of an input best satisfies well-formedness constraints. Optimality theory (which is actually a satisficing theory) applies the
same inferential principles as P M M theory to phonology and
morphology.

Recognition Principle
The recognition principle is a version of one-reason decision
making that exploits a lack of knowledge. The very fact that
one does not know is used to make accurate inferences. The
recognition principle is an intuitively plausible principle that
seems not to have been used until now in models of bounded
rationality. However, it has long been used to good advantage by
humans and other animals. For instance, advertisement techniques as recently used by Benetton put all effort into making
sure that every customer recognizes the brand name, with no
effort made to inform about the product itself. The idea behind
this is that recognition is a strong force in customers' choices.
One of our dear (and well-read) colleagues, after seeing a draft
of this article, explained to us how he makes inferences about
which books are worth acquiring. If he finds a book about a

663

great topic but does not recognize the name of the author, he
makes the inference that it is probably not worth buying. If,
after an inspection of the references, he does not recognize most
of the names, he concludes the book is not even worth reading.
The recognition principle is also known as one of the rules that
guide food preferences in animals. For instance, rats choose the
food that they recognize having eaten before (or having smelled
on the breath of fellow rats) and avoid novel foods (Gallistel,
Brown, Carey, Gelman, & Keil, 1991 ).
The empirical validity of the recognition principle for inferences about unknown city populations, as used in the present
simulations, can be directly tested in several ways. First, participants are presented pairs of cities, among them critical pairs in
which one city is recognized and the other unrecognized, and
their task is to infer which one has more inhabitants. The recognition principle predicts the recognized city. In our empirical
tests, participants followed the recognition principle in roughly
90% to 100% of all cases (Goldstein, 1994; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1996). Second, participants are taught a cue, its ecological validity, and the cue values for some of the objects (such as
whether a city has a soccer team or not). Subsequently, they are
tested on critical pairs of cities, one recognized and one unrecognized, where the recognized city has a negative cue value
(which indicates lower population). The second test is a harder
test for the recognition principle than the first one and can be
made even harder by using more cues with negative cue values
for the recognized object, and by other means. Tests of the second kind hax;e been performed, and participants still followed
the recognition principle more than 90% of the time, providing
evidence for its empirical validity (Goldstein, 1994; Goldstein
& Gigerenzer, 1996).
The recognition principle is a useful heuristic in domains
where recognition is a predictor of a target variable, such as
whether a food contains a toxic substance. In cases where recognition does not predict the target, the PMM algorithms can
still perform the inference, but without the recognition principle (i.e., Step 1 is canceled).

Limited Search
Both one-reason decision making and the recognition principle realize limited search by defining stopping points. Integration algorithms, in contrast, do not provide any model of stopping points and implicitly assume exhaustive search (although
they may provide rules for tossing out some of the variables in
a lengthy regression equation). Stopping rules are crucial for
modeling inference under limited time, as in Simon's examples
of satisficing, where search among alternatives terminates when
a certain aspiration level is met.

Nonlinearity
Linearity is a mathematically convenient tool that has dominated the theory of rational choice since its inception in the
mid-seventeenth century (Gigerenzer et al., 1989). The assumption is that the various components of an alternative add
up independently to its overall estimate or utility. In contrast,
nonlinear inference does not operate by computing linear sums
of (weighted) cue values. Nonlinear inference has many varieties, including simple principles such as in the conjunctive and

<-----Page 14----->664

GIGERENZER AND GOLDSTEIN

disjunctive algorithms (Einhorn, 1970) and highly complex
ones such as in nonlinear multiple regression and neural networks. The Take The Best algorithm and its variants belong to
the family of simple nonlinear models. One advantage of simple
nonlinear models is transparency; every step in the PMM algorithms can be followed through, unlike fully connected neural
networks with numerous hidden units and other free
parameters.
Our competition revealed that the unit-weight and weighted
versions of the linear models lead to about equal performance,
consistent with the finding that the choice of weights, provided
the sign is correct, does often not matter much (Dawes, 1979).
In real-world domains, such as in the prediction of sudden infant death from a linear combination of eight variables
(Carpenter, Gardner, McWeeny & Emery, 1977), the weights
can be varied across a broad range without decreasing predictive accuracy: a phenomenon known as the "fiat maximum
effect" (Lovie & Lovie, 1986; von Winterfeldt & Edwards,
1982). The competition in addition, showed that the fiat maximum effect extends to tallying, with unit-weight and weighted
tallying performing about equally well. The performance of the
Take The Best algorithm showed that the fiat maximum can
extend beyond linear models: Inferences based solely on the best
cue can be as accurate as any weighted or unit-weight linear
combination ofaU cues.
Most research in psychology and economics has preferred
linear models for description, prediction, and prescription
(Edwards, 1954, 1962; Lopes, 1994; von Winterfeldt & Edwards, 1982). Historically, linear models such as analysis of
variance and multiple regression originated as tools for data
analysis in psychological laboratories and were subsequently
projected by means of the "tools-to-theories heuristic" into theories of mind (Gigerenzer, 1991 ). The sufficiently good fit of
linear models in many judgment studies has been interpreted
that humans in fact might combine cues in a linear fashion.
However, whether this can be taken to mean that humans actually use linear models is controversial (Hammond & Summers,
1965; Hammond & Wascoe, 1980). For instance, within a certain range, data generated from the (nonlinear) law of falling
bodies can be fitted well by a linear regression. For the data in
the Appendix, a multiple linear regression resulted in R 2 = .87,
which means that a linear combination of the cues can predict
the target variable quite well. But the simpler, nonlinear, Take
The Best algorithm could match this performance. Thus, good
fit of a linear model does not rule out simpler models of
inference.
Shepard (1967) reviewed the empirical evidence for the
claim that humans integrate information by linear models. He
distinguished between the perceptual transformation of raw
sensory inputs into conceptual objects and properties and the
subsequent inference based on conceptual knowledge. He concluded that the perceptual analysis integrates the responses of
the vast number of receptive elements into concepts and properties by complex nonlinear rules but once this is done, "there
is little evidence that they can in turn be juggled and recombined with anything like this facility" (Shepard, 1967, p. 263 ).
Although our minds can take account of a host of different factors, and although we can remember and report doing so, "it is
seldom more than one or two that we consider at any one time"
(Shepard, 1967, p. 267). In Shepard's view, there is little evi-

dence for integration, linear or otherwise, in what we term inferences from memory--even without constraints of limited
time and knowledge. A further kind of evidence does not support linear integration as a model of memory-based inference.
People often have great difiiculties in handling correlations between cues (e.g., Armelius & Armelius, 1974), whereas integration models such as multiple regression need to handle intercorrelations. To summarize, for memory-based inference,
there seems to be little empirical evidence for the view of the
mind as a Laplacean Demon equipped with the computational
powers to perform multiple regressions. But this need not be
taken as bad news. The beauty of the nonlinear satisficing algorithms is that they can match the Demon's performance with
less searching, less knowledge, and less computational might.

Intransitivity
Transitivity is a cornerstone of classical rationality. It is one
of the few tenets that the Anglo-American school of Ramsey
and Savage shares with the competing Franco-European school
of AUais (Fishburn, 1991 ). If we prefer a to b and b to c, then
we should also prefer a to c. The linear algorithms in our competition always produce transitive inferences (except for ties,
where the algorithm randomly guessed), and city populations
are, in fact, transitive. The PMM family of algorithms includes
algorithms that do not violate transitivity (such as the Take The
Best algorithm), and others that do (e.g., the Minimalist
algorithm). The Minimalist algorithm randomly selects a cue
on which to base the inference, therefore intransitivities can resuit. Table 2 shows that in spite of these intransitivities, overall
performance of the algorithm is only about 1 percentage point
lower than that of the best transitive algorithms and a few percentage points better than some transitive algorithms.
An organism that used the Take The Best algorithm with a
stricter discrimination rule (actually, the original version found
in Gigerenzer et al., 1991 ) could also be forced into making
intransitive inferences. The stricter discrimination rule is that
search is only terminated when one positive and one negative
cue value (but not one positive and one unknown cue value)
are encountered. Figure 8 illustrates a state of knowledge in
which this stricter discrimination rule gives the result that a
dominates b, b dominates c, and c dominates a.7
7Note that missing knowledge is necessary for intransitivities to occur. If all cue values are known, no intransitive inferences can possibly
result. The algorithm with the stricter discrimination rule allowsprecise
predictions about the occurrence of intransitivitics over the course of
knowledge acquisition. For instance, imagine a person whose knowledge is described by Figure 8, except that she does not know the value
of Cue 2 for object c. This person would make no intransitivejudgments

<-----Page 15----->REASONING THE FAST AND FRUGAL WAY
Biological systems, for instance, can exhibit systematic intransitivities based on incommensurability between two systems on one dimension (Gilpin, 1975; Lewontin, 1968 ). Imagine three species: a, b, and c. Species a inhabits both water and
land; species b inhabits both water and air. Therefor e, the two
only compete in water, where species a defeats species b. Species
c inhabits land and air, so it only competes with b in the air,
where it is defeated by b. Finally, when a and c meet, it is only
on land, and here, c is in its element and defeats a. A linear
model that estimates some value for the combative strength of
each species independently of the species with which it is competing would fail to capture this nontransitive cycle.

Inferences Without Estimation
Einhorn and Hogarth ( i 9 7 5 ) noted that in the unit-weight
model "there is essentially no estimation involved in its use" (p.
177), except for the sign of the unit weight. A similar result
holds for the algorithms reported here. The Take The Best algorithm does not need to estimate regression weights, it only
needs to estimate a rank ordering of ecological validities. The
Take The Last and the Minimalist algorithms involve essentially no estimation (except for the sign of the cues). The fact
that there is no estimation problem has an important consequence: An organism can use as many cues as it has experienced, without being concerned about whether the size of the
sample experienced is sufficiently large to generate reliable estimates of weights.

Cue Redundancy and Performance
Einhorn and Hogarth (1975) suggested that unit-weight
models can be expected to perform approximately as well as
proper linear models when (a) R 2 from the regression model is
in the moderate or low range (around .5 or smaller) and (b)
predictors (cues) are correlated. Are these two criteria necessary, sufficient, or both to explain the performance of the Take
The Best algorithm? The Take The Best algorithm and its variants certainly can exploit cue redundancy: If cues are highly
correlated, one cue can do the job.
We have already seen that in the present environment, R z =
.87, which is in the high rather than the moderate nr lnw range.
As mentioned earlier, the pairwise correlations between the
nine ecological cues ranged between - . 2 5 and .54, with an absolute average value of .19. Thus, despite a high R 2 and only
moderate-to-small correlation between cues, the satisficing algorithms performed quite successfully. Their excellent performance in the competition can be explained only partially by cue
redundancy, because the cues were only moderately correlated.
High cue redundancy, thus, does seem sufficient but is not nec-

comparing objects a, b, and c. If she were to learn that object c had a
negative cue value for Cue 2, she would produce an intransitive judgment. If she learned one piece more, namely, the value of Cue 1 for
object c, then she would no longer produce an intransitive judgment.
The prediction is that transitive judgments should turn into intransitive
ones and back, during learning. Thus, intransitivitiesdo not simply depend on the amount of limited knowledge but also on what knowledge
is missing.

essary for the successful performance of the satisficing
algorithms.

A New Perspective on the Lens Model
Ecological theorists such as Brunswik (1955) emphasized
that the cognitive system is designed to find many pathways to
the world, substituting missing cues by whatever cues happen to
be available. Brunswik labeled this ability vicariousfunctioning,
in which he saw the most fundamental principle of a science of
perception and cognition. His proposal to model this adaptive
process by linear multiple regression has inspired a long tradition of neo-Brunswikian research (B. Brehmer, 1994; Hammond, 1990), although the empirical evidence for mental
multiple regression is still controversial (e.g., A. Brehmer & B.
Brehmer, 1988). However, vicarious functioning need not be
equated with linear regression. The PMM family of algorithms
provides an alternative, nonadditive model of vicarious functioning, in which cue substitution operates without integration.
This gives a new perspective of Brunswik's lens model. In a onereason decision making lens, the first discriminating cue that
passes through inhibits any other rays passing through and determines judgment. Noncompensatory vicarious functioning is
consistent with some of Brunswik's original examples, such as
the substitution of behaviors in Hull's habit-family hierarchy,
and the alternative manifestation of symptoms according to the
psychoanalytic writings of Frenkel-Brunswik (see Gigerenzer &
Murray, 1987, chap. 3).
It has been reported sometimes that teachers, physicians, and
other professionals claim that they use seven or so criteria to
make judgments (e.g., when grading papers or making a differential diagnosis) but that experimental tests showed that they
in fact often used only one criterion (Shepard, 1967). At first
glance, this seems to indicate that those professionals make outrageous claims. But it need not be. If experts' vicarious functioning works according to the P M M algorithms, then they are
correct in saying that they use many predictors, but the decision
is made by only one at any time.

What Counts as Good Reasoning?
Much of the research on reasoning in the last decades has
assumed that sound reasoning can be reduced to principles of
internal consistency, such as additivity of probabilities, conformity to truth-table logic, and transitivity. For instance, research
on the Wason selection task, the "Linda" problem, and the
"cab" problem has evaluated reasoning almost exclusively by
some measure of internal consistency (Gigerenzer, 1995,
1996a). Cognitive algorithms, however, need to meet more important constraints than internal consistency: (a) They need to
be psychologically plausible, (b) they need to be fast, and (c)
they need to make accurate inferences in real-world environments. In real time and real environments, the possibility that
an algorithm (e.g., the Minimalist algorithm) can make intransitive inferences does not mean that it will make them all the
time or that this feature of the algorithm will significantly hurt
its accuracy. What we have not addressed in this article are constraints on human reasoning that emerge from the fact that
Homo sapiens is a social animal (Gigerenzer, 1996b). For instance, some choices (e.g., who to treat first in an emergency

<-----Page 16----->666

GIGERENZER AND GOLDSTEIN

room) need to be justified (Tetlock, 1992 ). Going with the single best reason, the strategy of the Take The Best algorithm, has
an immediate appeal for justification and can be more convincing and certainly easier to communicate than some complicated
weighting of cues.
Further Research
Among the questions that need to be addressed in future research are the following. First, how can we generalize the present satisficing algorithm from two-alternative-choice tasks to
other inferential tasks, such as classification and estimation?
The reported success of the classification and regression tree
models (Breiman et al., 1993 ), which use a form of one-reason
decision making, is an encouraging sign that what we have
shown here for two-alternative-choice tasks might be generalizable. Second, what is the structure of real-world environments
that allows simple algorithms to perform so well? We need to
develop a conceptual language that can capture important aspects of the structure of environments that simple cognitive algorithms can exploit. The traditional proposal for understanding the structure of environments in terms of ecological validities defined as linear correlations (Brunswik, 1955 ) may not be
adequate, as the power of the nonlinear satisficing algorithms
suggests.
C a n R e a s o n i n g B e R a t i o n a l a n d Psychological?
At the beginning of this article, we pointed out the common
opposition between the rational and the psychological, which
emerged in the nineteenth century after the breakdown of the
classical interpretation of probability (Gigerenzer et al., 1989).
Since then, rational inference is commonly reduced to logic and
probability theory, and psychological explanations are called on
when things go wrong. This division of labor is, in a nutshell,
the basis on which much of the current research on judgment
under uncertainty is built. As one economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put it, "either reasoning is rational or it's psychological" (Gigerenzer, 1994). Can not reasoning be both rational and psychological?
We believe that after 40 years of toying with the notion of
bounded rationality, it is time to overcome the opposition between the rational and the psychological and to reunite the two.
The PMM family of cognitive algorithms provides precise
models that attempt to do so. They differ from the Enlightenment's unified view of the rational and psychological, in that
they focus on simple psychological mechanisms that operate
under constraints of limited time and knowledge and are supported by empirical evidence. The single most important result
in this article is that simple psychological mechanisms can yield
about as many (or more) correct inferences in less time than
standard statistical linear models that embody classical properties of rational inference. The demonstration that a fast and frugal satisficing algorithm won the competition defeats the widespread view that only "rational" algorithms can be accurate.
Models of inference do not have to forsake accuracy for simplicity. The mind can have it both ways.
