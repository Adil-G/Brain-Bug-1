ABSTRACT It is now recognised that many businesses are unsuccessful in raising
equity finance because they are not investment ready. This has prompted enterprise
support organisations in various countries to develop investment ready programmes.
In the UK, the emphasis of these programmes is on providing information on sources
of finance and how to access them, and on presentational skills. These are necessary
but not sufficient conditions to get a business investment ready because they do not
address business development issues which discourage potential investors. These
issues are generally company specific and often require the input of significant
expertise in order to make a company investable. This paper reviews LINC Scotland’s
approach, which is based on investment facilitation. It suggests that this approach
does effectively address the business development support component of investment
readiness at limited public cost and provides useful lessons for the design of
investment ready programmes.

Introduction
The financing needs of the vast majority of SMEs are met by personal
and informal sources of finance plus bank loans and overdrafts. However,
for a minority of firms, these sources are inappropriate or inadequate,
and some form of venture capital is needed. Two types of firms fall into
this category. The first are new businesses seeking to exploit significant
growth opportunities, usually but not always as a result of a technological
innovation. For these businesses, positive returns are expected to be
generated only after a number of years. They are unable to fund this
growth from internally generated sources, do not have a positive cash
flow to support a bank loan, and are too small to access public equity
markets. The second type of firm are young fast-growing companies with
negative cash flows which arise from the need to invest in R&D, product
development and testing; to purchase facilities, key equipment, materials
and components; recruit management and sales staff; and build up
inventory. These businesses lack either personal or appropriate business
assets (which may be intangible in the form of patents, trademarks or
human capital) as security for bank loans. Indeed, the faster the growth
the more voracious is the appetite for cash (Binks & Ennew, 1996).
Venture capital investors understand the risks involved in funding
such companies, possess the know-how to evaluate them, have contracting skills which minimise their downside and make a range of postinvestment contributions, notably providing coaching and strategic advice
to the management team, help in attracting additional finance, managers
and non-executive directors and providing contacts with suppliers,
customers and advisers. Their investments take the form of equity finance,
which enables them to share in the up-side success of such businesses
in exchange for sharing in the risks. The two main sources of early stage
venture capital are:
. Business angels: high net worth individuals, typically successful cashed
out or disengaged entrepreneurs (often serial entrepreneurs) and senior
managers from large companies, who invest a small proportion of
their own wealth in SMEs. While most business angels invest on their
own or in small groups an increasing number are joining larger and more
structured angel syndicates.
. Venture capital firms which create fixed life investment vehicles—
venture capital funds—which raise finance from banks, pension funds
and other financial institutions and other investors (e.g. wealthy families,
large non-financial corporations). These funds, which normally have a
10-year life, are managed by the venture capital firm to invest in specified
investment situations (location, sector, stage of business development).
Business angels and venture capital funds typically play complementary
roles, with angels investing at an earlier stage than venture capital funds
and making smaller investments (Freear & Wetzel, 1990; Harrison &
Mason, 2000).

A New Approach to Investment Readiness 161
The economic significance of venture capital is underlined by studies
which show that venture capital-backed firms play a disproportionate role
in innovation, the formation and commercialisation of new industries
(Bygrave & Timmons, 1992; Kortnum & Lerner, 2000), and the formation
of technology clusters (Feldman, 2001; Norton, 2001; Mason et al, 2002),
grow more quickly than non-venture capital-backed companies (Gompers
& Lerner, 2001) and make an important contribution to productivity growth
(HM Treasury/Small Business Service, 2003). This is recognised by
both the UK government and by the EU Commission. For example, Gordon
Brown MP, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated in his pre-budget
statement of November 1998 that ‘a strong venture capital industry
supporting high technology high risk investments is critical to the future
of Britain’. From the outset, enhancing the availability of venture capital
has been a key part of the Labour Government’s agenda to create a
competitive, knowledge-driven, entrepreneurial economy (Department of
Trade and Industry, 1998). In a recent restatement of the Government’s
approach to the promotion of its approach to the promotion of entrepreneurship the importance of venture capital has again been emphasised
(HM Treasury/Small Business Service, 2002, 2003).
Gaps in the Supply of Venture Capital
There is widespread recognition of the existence of market failure in the
supply of early stage venture capital (e.g. Harding, 2000; Treasury/Small
Business Service, 2002, 2003), which has created a shortage of small
amounts of equity capital, especially from venture capital funds. There are
a number of reasons for the existence of this equity gap (HM Treasury/
Small Business Service, 2003, pp. 11–12). First, in order to overcome
information asymmetries, investments are made only after the investor
has undertaken a rigorous examination of the company. These evaluation
and due diligence costs are largely fixed regardless of the size of the
investment and so may make smaller investments uneconomic. Second,
the costs involved in monitoring investments and in providing postinvestment support to investee companies are also largely fixed. Here again
these costs represent a much larger proportion of smaller investments
and will require higher than average investment performance and returns
to recoup them. Third, risk is perceived to be higher for seed, start-up
and early growth stage businesses because the management team is
inexperienced and has gaps and the product and market may be unproven.
Uncertainties may be even greater if the firm is based on an innovative
technology. Fourth, business angels and venture capital funds typically
seek their returns in the form of capital gains. Uncertainty about potential
exit options may also act as a deterrent. Fifth, the increase in the size
of funds that venture capital firms have under management has also
resulted in much larger investments. In order to invest these larger funds
within the time horizon of the fund, investment managers, whose numbers
have not increased in line with the size of the funds that they have to invest,

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:11 8 April 2009

162 Colin M. Mason & Richard T. Harrison
have had to significantly increase the average investment size. Finally, in
the UK, and indeed more generally across Europe, the highest returns
have been generated by funds specialising in later stage investments, and
management buyouts in particular, making it much harder for early stage
funds to raise finance from financial institutions (Murray, 1999).
In response, the UK Government has implemented a number of
measures to tackle the equity gap (HM Treasury/Small Business Service,
2002, 2003). First, regional venture capital funds have been set up across
England to invest in SMEs with growth potential: these funds are backed
by £80m of government funding which has matched private sector
investments1. Initial investments are restricted to £250,000, with up to
£250,000 more allowed as follow-on finance. Second, the Early Growth
Funding programme provides smaller amounts of risk capital, averaging
around £50,000, for start-up and early stage businesses. Third, UK
High-Technology Fund has been established in the form of a fund-of-funds.
Government acts as a cornerstone investor in each fund to leverage private
sector investment. Fourth, the Bridges Community Development Venture
Fund invests in the most deprived wards in England. Finally, a range of
measures have been introduced to encourage greater investment activity
by business angels. These include reforms to capital gains tax; changes
to the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), which provides tax reliefs
to investors in qualifying companies; co-investment via the Early Growth
Funding scheme; modifications to securities legislation in the Financial
Services and Markets Act to make it easier for entrepreneurs to promote
their investment opportunities to potential private investors; and support for
the National Business Angels Network to improve information availability.
Investment Readiness and Demand for Venture Capital
Evidence is accumulating that an exclusively supply side approach to the
equity gap is inappropriate and will be ineffective without complementary
measures which address demand-side constraints (Mason & Harrison,
2003a). There is considerable evidence that business angels are unable to
invest as frequently or as much as they would like because of the low
quality of the investment opportunities that they see (Mason & Harrison,
1999, 2002; Paul, Whittam & Johnston, 2003) and that venture capital funds
are unable to invest up to their capacity.2 This arises for two main reasons.
First, consistent with the ‘pecking order’ hypothesis (Myers, 1984), there
is a high level of equity aversion amongst SMEs (Mason & Harrison, 1993;
1

2

A similar scheme is operated by Scottish Enterprise in Scotland on a fund-of-funds basis,
with Scottish Executive money placed in funds that are matched by and managed by
private sector interests, including business angel syndicates.
For example, Eastern Scotland Investments, a £7 million early stage venture capital fund
managed by Gap Fund Managers, had to return £1.5 million to its investors (including
£500,000 to the European Regional Development Fund) because it could not find
sufficient investment-ready investment opportunities (Scotsman, 2001).

A New Approach to Investment Readiness 163
Landström & Winborg, 1995; Cressy & Olofsson, 1997) which means that
many potentially investable projects do not come forward as potential
recipients for venture capital. This is attributed in part to the failure of
entrepreneurs to understand the role of different sources of finance in
business development, but also to their reluctance to surrender ownership
and control of their business.
Second, and more significantly in terms of this paper, many of the
businesses which do seek venture capital are not investment ready.
This encompasses all aspects of the business that relate to an investor’s
perception of its ‘investability’, including management team skills, the
clarity with which the opportunity is defined, the business model, route to
market, governance arrangements and presentation. As a consequence,
the entrepreneur is unable to tell a convincing and compelling story to
potential investors (Shepherd & Douglas, 1999). Business angels are
turned off by businesses that lack focus; where comprehensive and
credible market information is lacking; that operate in highly competitive
markets; and lack a USP (i.e. ‘me too’ products and services). They want
to understand the way that the product or service is distinctive or superior
to that of the competition and how any competitive advantage will be
sustained. They also place considerable emphasis on the experience and
track-record of the entrepreneur, his/her commitment, the upside potential
of the business, and the use to which the finance that is sought will be
put (Mason & Rogers, 1997). Business angels registered with the National
Business Angels Network (NBAN) reported that the main deficiencies
in the proposals that they see are, first, business plans which contain
unrealistic assumptions or information that is not credible and, second,
entrepreneur/management teams which lack credibility (Mason & Harrison,
2002). Significant, although less frequently cited weaknesses include
insufficient information provided, business concept requires further development and limited growth prospects of the business (Table 1). The
Eastern Scotland Investments Limited Partnership, an ERDF-supported
seed capital fund that was set up in July 1999 to address the ‘equity gap’,
reports similar reasons for rejecting the 99 applicants that it declined to
invest in (Table 2).
A proportion of businesses that investors reject because they are not
investment ready have the potential to become investable if they receive
appropriate support. However, in such cases investors will be deterred
by the costs (typically the time involved) of undertaking the necessary
investigations in order to assess whether the business has the potential
to become an attractive investment opportunity. Having identified the
problems that prevent such businesses from being investment ready, there
are likely to be further costs—both time inputs to provide the necessary
level of support and fees to employ specialists—to fix them. The rational
response of investors is therefore to reject these opportunities and seek
out others that involve lower investigative and support costs (Douglas &
Shepherd, 2002). This is consistent with evidence on the approach of
business angels to making investments. Mason & Rogers (1997) note that

Table 2. Reasons for rejecting investment opportunities: the case of the Eastern Scotland
Investments Fund
‘The majority were declined on the basis of a suspect business plan or business model . . .
The most common characteristic was the inability of the applicant to demonstrate a credible
revenue model. They could not show that the company could attract sufficient paying
customers to cover the costs of the business. Behind this generalisation are a range of
problems. The inability to demonstrate any unique selling point—why would anyone
purchase your product? The inability to demonstrate a route to market—how are you
going to get your product to a customer? The inability to demonstrate that there were
sufficient potential customers to warrant the new business. Very often the plans
concentrated on the product or technology developed by the applicant, but little or no
consideration had been given to the costs of marketing, distribution or customer servicing.’

investors typically start with a sceptical stance when they consider
investment opportunities and are looking for reasons to say ‘no’ (a ‘three
strikes and you’re out approach’). One investor described his approach as
follows: ‘Throughout this I’m very cynical and sarcastic and I have to be
because I know that I’d have to look at ten [investment opportunities] to
get seriously involved with one. Really, my aim is to eliminate nine, rather
than find the gem now. . . . If I can’t eliminate this one, that’s the gem. So
the assumption I start with is that it’s lousy and as I go on I [may] change
my mind’ (quoted in Mason & Rogers, 1997, p. 38). Business plans which

A New Approach to Investment Readiness 165
fail to provide appropriate information, or are poorly presented, or both, are
therefore unable to dispel that doubts that investors typically start with.
Indeed, such deficiencies may serve to increase the investor’s scepticism.
One investor’s reaction to hearing a poor pitch by an entrepreneur at an
investment forum was to ask: ‘if he can’t sell to investors, how can he sell
to customers?’ (quoted in Mason & Harrison, 2003b).
In the light of this evidence the UK Government has recognised the
need to complement its various supply-side measures to improve
the financing environment for growth-oriented with initiatives to address
the demand-side (HM Treasury/Small Business Service, 2001, 2003). The
Government is now supporting six investment readiness services
demonstration projects with a view to launching a national investment
ready programme following the evaluation of these tenders. A number
of business angel networks—some with DTI support—are also involved
in delivering investment ready programmes.3 Scottish Enterprise (2002) is
running an investment ready programme alongside a programme to
support the creation of early stage venture capital funds. Investment ready
programmes are also in place in several other jurisdictions, including
Australia (Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania (www.bt.tas.gov.au/dsd/)
and New Zealand (www.vcapital.co.nz).
However, the emphasis of existing investment ready programmes in the
UK is on the provision of intensive information to SMEs via seminars
and workshops to raise their awareness and understanding of the various
financing options available and how best to access them. In terms of
the five stage model of an Investment Ready Programme proposed
by Mason & Harrison (2001), and based on the programme developed
by the Government of Victoria, existing UK investment ready initiatives are
addressing the awareness and presentation elements but are not effectively engaging in the critical diagnostic and business support components.4 What is being delivered through such programmes is therefore
necessary but is not sufficient to get businesses investment ready. This
is because investment readiness is fundamentally about business development issues, is often nebulous and generally company-specific and
requires the input of significant amounts of expertise to identify and
address barriers to investment. As a consequence, such support is timeconsuming and, therefore, expensive to deliver (and, of course, well
beyond the means of most start-up and early stage companies to purchase
themselves).
The challenge is therefore to design and deliver an investment
ready programme which incorporates an effective business development
support component at low cost. The remainder of the paper provides

Some of these are not described as such, having been developed before the term
became popularised.
The fifth stage in the programme is an initiative to link businesses to potential investors
(e.g. business angel networks, venture capital fairs).

a review of LINC Scotland’s ‘trial marriage’ scheme, a programme that,
arguably, does meet these criteria. The pilot scheme, which operated in
1998–89, is described, the participating companies are profiled and the
outcomes for each company are noted. A modified version of the scheme,
renamed the Investment Facilitation Grant, was re-launched in 2001–2002.
The modifications are highlighted and the reasons for making them are
discussed. The information is based on interviews with the programme
manager and with the two angels who were involved with the majority of
the companies that participated in the pilot scheme.
LINC Scotland’s ‘Trial Marriage’ Scheme
LINC Scotland is one of the longest established business angel networks in
the UK and one of the most active. It was established in its present form
in 1993 and has been responsible for facilitating some 200 identifiable
investments by business angels in the period 1994–October 2003. The
Trial Marriage scheme was created in response to evidence that there was
a category of investment opportunities that investors intuitively recognised
to have potential (e.g. a good idea, interesting technology, market
potential) but required significant additional work to get to the point
where they could attract funds. These opportunities are of two types. In the
first category there is a specific issue (e.g. relating to IPR) requiring a
significant sum to address, which prevents an investment from occurring.
The company is unable to afford to cost of overcoming the problem and
prospective investors are not willing to see a significant proportion of
their time or initial investment going to fix a problem rather than contribute
to the growth and development of the business. In the second category
the issues are more nebulous, with the potential investor reporting that
the business ‘needs knocked into shape’. This could include having
inadequate financial systems to generate the necessary information,
requiring forensic accounting to identify the business’s real financial status,
and poor management, requiring the need to locate and bring in a new
management team and persuading the existing management to step aside.
Although potential investors have the experience to deal with such issues,
they are not prepared to devote the necessary time without reward as
there remains a significant risk that the business will remain uninvestable,
despite the investor’s efforts.
The Trial Marriage scheme operated during 1998–99 under a Scottish
Office initiative to support technology SMEs in the Central Belt of Scotland.
This initiative, in turn, was part of an ERDF scheme to support technology
businesses in Objective 2 regions. The initiative (which included support
for the commercialisation of spin-out businesses) gave small grants to
companies to address an agreed programme of work. The maximum
funding limit per company was £7,500 (E12,000), with companies having to
contribute 25% of the costs, meaning that the scheme could fund £10,000
(E16,000) of work. The daily rate for outside assistance was £350 (E550)
per day for a maximum of 15 days, a rate which was too low to be attractive

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:11 8 April 2009

A New Approach to Investment Readiness 167
to consultants. However, a number of business angels were prepared
to work for this level of remuneration if they thought that the business
had potential. The grant was returned to LINC Scotland if the investor
subsequently decided to invest in the company.
The Trial Marriage scheme did not invite applications. There were two
ways in which companies joined the scheme. Companies could be brought
to LINC Scotland by their advisers, or by potential investors, to make a
case for support. In these cases potential investors had already been
identified. One business angel syndicate brought forward three businesses
for funding.5 In all cases these were investment opportunities which would
not otherwise have been considered further for investment. Alternatively,
LINC Scotland itself identified companies with a need for this form of
support from its own list of business clients. In these cases LINC identified
potential investors from amongst its investor membership.
A total of six companies with a range of different needs were supported
through the trial marriage scheme (Table 3). This resulted in five
investments being made and, in the sixth case, a licensing arrangement
being developed. Three of the businesses continue to trade and another
has been ‘merged’ into another company. For the companies which
participated in the scheme, the results have, on occasion, been impressive.
For example, Company F was originally started in 1997 with around
£300,000 of external informal equity investment. By early 1999 it was
clear that the company was running out of cash (due to large development
costs) and required a further injection of capital. The company came to
LINC Scotland which invited a business angel to look at it with a view to
‘tidying up’ the business plan and developing a funding proposal. However,
the angel discovered that the company was in a mess: it actually comprised
three separate businesses, there was no real cash flow or knowledge of
gross margins, the accounting system was poor and the nominal ledger did
not add up. In reality the company was insolvent. The angel developed a
strategy involving the disposal of one business and using a second
business as a cash-cow to fund the costs of developing a third business
which appeared to have a promising business opportunity to exploit. A
group of four business angels and a bank agreed to fund the company.
However, a combination of a £0.5m ‘black hole’ in the accounts and a
problematic CEO led to the company going into receivership before the

This syndicate had between 50 and 80 members, most of whom were cashed out
entrepreneurs looking to reinvest in fast-growth companies. Members could decide on a
deal-by-deal basis whether or not to invest. They hired a manager to find investment
opportunities and undertake investigative research on those companies that were of
interest to the syndicate members. The manager’s skill was to recognise what inputs were
required by investee companies and to manage the investment process, matching
syndicate members with appropriate investee companies and also with appropriate other
syndicate members. The manager was not paid a fee but could participate in the
investments. The syndicate folded when the manager was head-hunted by a Plc and then
moved on to be the CEO of an internet company.

Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:11 8 April 2009

Company A. A software company that was brought to LINC Scotland by a syndicate manager.
The syndicate was convinced by the technology and product but recognised that management
was weak and needed an injection of commercial experience. The manager put in place a plan
with administrative, technical and commercial milestones specified to show how the business
would develop. This enabled the manager to raise £370,000 from angels (including one high
profile technology angel) and £130,000 in bank debt on behalf of the company. The business
subsequently failed.
Company B. A spin-out company from a university research institute involved in the development
of drug compounds for the pharmaceutical industry which the same syndicate manager brought
to LINC Scotland. The company had been unsuccessful in raising finance. The syndicate
provided some non-executive directors and created a development plan and strategy to
support the fund-raising process. The company attracted £2 million in institutional investment.
Company C. A company producing simulation software which was brought to LINC Scotland by
the same manager. It required a finance director, an injection of commercial nous and better
networking and its finances needed to be straightened out. The syndicate provided commercial
experience and one of its members became the finance director. The Trial Marriage enabled the
manager to build an action plan with milestones which led to the raising of a SMART award
(£50,000) and £180,000 of investment from business angels. The company later failed because
of a combination of an internal integrity issue which forced one of the founders to resign and the
serious illness of the other founder.
Company D. This was a university spin-out company engaged in neural networks which
approached LINC Scotland looking for £30,000 to lever a SPUR grant (which required
matched funding). LINC Scotland introduced the company to a business angel who had a
software background and connections to a ‘mega-angel’. The reputation of the angel as an
expert in the field provided an endorsement of the software. The scheme also covered some
legal costs that were incurred in developing the software licence to provide protection and enable
the software to be sold. Additionally the angel used his connections with potential customers to
help the company to get into the market. This enabled the company to raise a funding package of
£321,000: two angels each invested £30,000 and the Scottish Technology Fund invested the
rest. This company has recently failed.
Company E. A software company had jointly developed some software in conjunction with a
public sector organisation. The company wanted to develop the product commercially but the
public sector organisation was unrealistic in its negotiating position. The company therefore
required access to commercial skills to negotiate a deal. LINC Scotland introduced the
company to the same angel as in Company D. The outcome was a deal to licence the
software to third parties. No investment was involved.
Company F. A biotech company, started by two scientists, which had come up with a more
efficient method of producing monoclonal antibodies—a key input for other biotech companies—
came to LINC Scotland looking for finance to sort out its manufacturing operations and develop
a new approach to the market. LINC Scotland introduced the company to a business angel
who discovered that the company was in greater difficulty than the principals realised. The
angel developed a strategy which resulted in himself and three other angels investing.
However, the company soon failed. It was relaunched in a ‘phoenix’ operation with financial
backing from the original angel investors. The lead angel became executive chairman. The
company was relocated to a prestige technology location and a prominent research institution
agreed to invest which gave immediate credibility to the reformed company. A further £160,000
was raised from angels and £100,000 in the form of a loan under the Small Firms Loan
Guarantee Scheme. It was subsequently acquired by a Canadian multinational biotech
company which has made further substantial investments in the company. It now employs
around 50 people.

deal was effected. The angel group then put up £50,000 to buy back the
assets of the failed company and back two of the original team to pursue
the same opportunity under a new name. In addition, a strategic partner
(a research institution) was attracted as an equity investor and to provide
laboratory resources and credibility. However, the new company never hit
break-even and the angels had to put further money into the company to
keep it going. It was therefore decided to try to find a trade buyer for the
company. A Canadian biotechnology company expressed an interest,
initially buying 75% of the shares. Two of the angel investors and the
research institute sold their shares at this stage. The outstanding shares
were bought from the remaining shareholders six months later. The new
owner invested £3m in the company and a further £1m was spent on new
premises. A subsequent stock market flotation raised £30 million.
The Revised Programme: Investment Facilitation Grants
Despite the promise shown, the scheme was terminated following the
ending of funding under the ERDF programme. A delay in implementing
the new EU 6th Framework Programme for 2000–2006 meant that funding
to continue the Trial Marriage scheme, renamed an Investment Facilitation
Grant, was only approved in December 2001. This revised scheme got
off to a low-key start in order to avoid the potential for confusing the
market arising from the announcement and subsequent launch of Scottish
Enterprise’s own investment readiness scheme which is a much more
broadly focused scheme. However, since August 2003 it has been given
a higher profile. A total of 10 grants have been made or committed, of
which six have been committed in the three months since August, and
enquiries are running at two a week.
The Investment Facilitation Grant has some important differences from
the original scheme. First, the funding now supports companies rather than
investors. Investors are supported only indirectly. However, the scheme
is driven by the needs of the potential investor, with LINC Scotland
remunerating companies for the cost an agreed programme of deliverables
that are identified by the solutions provider—typically a potential investor—
or by LINC Scotland itself.
Second, the original concept of the scheme was that it would pay for
the time of potential investors to undertake significant investigations of
businesses in situations where they would otherwise have been deterred
by the time input involved. However, the revised scheme has been
broadened from a payment to angels to remunerate their time to a grant
to cover the cost of solving specific problems that are identified by angels
as being a barrier to investment such as the need for expert inputs in
the form of IP protection, legal costs or specialist external due diligence
(e.g. on technology).6

One example of the use of this money was to pay for a legal opinion which potential
investors required before they would be willing to invest.

Third, the scheme is now targeted at syndicates rather than individual
angel investors. This reflects the greater demand for the scheme from
angel syndicates. However, it also fits with LINC Scotland’s general shift in
the main focus of its activity away from conventional match-making and
towards supporting business syndicates to ensure that they can continue
to make investments in the equity gap on a cost effective basis. Under
the scheme angel syndicates can pass on their eligible pre-deal diligence
and assessment costs. This is an attempt to counter the tendency
for ‘investment drift’ amongst both venture capital funds and angels
syndicates in their minimum size of investment.
Fourth, the maximum grant has been raised to £15,000 per company:
this covers 70% of total costs (half of which is provided by the EU, with the
remainder provided by the professional firms which sponsor the scheme)
with companies providing the balance. This increase reflects the trend
towards a larger size of investments (reflecting the involvement of angel
syndicates) and the need to be able to cover expensive costs such as the
use of technology consultants and legal issues related to IP.
Fifth, in the light of evidence that deals were collapsing because
companies were using inappropriate advisers (especially legal advisers)
who were inexperienced in raising equity funding, the revised scheme
includes the ability to underwrite the additional costs of using more
appropriate advisers. Such companies are offered a choice from a panel of
advisers (all of whom sponsor the scheme).
Finally, previously the investor returned the grant to LINC Scotland if he
or she decided to invest. Under the Investment Facilitation Grant, the grant
becomes convertible to LINC Scotland equity in the company on the same
terms as the main external investors. LINC Scotland will exit at the same
time as the other investors. The intention is that in due course such returns
will make a significant contribution to LINC Scotland’s annual income,
thereby reducing its reliance on public funds for its running costs.7 The
Financial Services Authority has approved this arrangement provided that
LINC Scotland had not introduced the company to the investor (otherwise
it would have a pecuniary interest). LINC Scotland therefore needs to
have companies brought to them by third parties in order to conform to the
FSA ruling.
LINC Scotland’s budget for the its Investment Facilitation Grant is
£150,000 per annum, which is equivalent to £240,000 per annum taking
into account the spending by the companies and sponsors. This would fund
16 grants per annum at full cost but as not all support will be at full cost
the actual target is 20 supported companies per year.

Following the publication of the investment returns by Archangels and Braveheart, leading
Scottish business angel syndicates, LINC Scotland has calculated that if it had made
grants worth £10,000 to each of the companies that these syndicates had invested from
1997 to 2000 inclusive it would have received a cash return in 2001 equivalent to onethird of its current annual running costs.

Conclusion
It is now recognised that the equity gap cannot be addressed entirely by
supply-side measures. The impact of an increase in the supply of early
stage venture capital will be limited because many of the businesses that
come forward are not investment ready. The consequence is that investors
are unable to make as many investments, or invest as much as they wish.
This has prompted various organisations, often with government support,
to develop investment ready schemes. These generally take the form of
seminars and workshops that are designed to provide information on the
sources of finance available and their uses, and how to access these
different types of finance. They may also include training in presentational
skills. However, this approach is rarely sufficient to turn businesses into
investable propositions, and typically there is a need for an external
diagnosis on a case-by-case basis. Specialist assistance is often required
to remove the barriers to investment that are identified by the expert
diagnosis. Some investment ready schemes do incorporate the external
assessment stage (Mason & Harrison, 2001) but it is generally left to the
entrepreneur to take the initiative in addressing the issues raised.
However, the costs involved are likely to be beyond what the entrepreneur
can afford and what a prospective investor is willing to spend.
LINC Scotland’s investment facilitation grant offers a different approach
to overcoming the demand-side constraints on the early stage venture
capital market. The key feature of the scheme in its present form is that it
is driven by the needs of the would-be investors who bring companies
forward where there are specific problems which prevent an investment
from being made and which require time and money to be addressed
(either by the investors themselves or from external specialists) to make
the investment do-able. The effect is therefore to reduce the transaction
costs of both individual business angels and syndicates so that they can
spend time and money to turn businesses that they would otherwise have
rejected (and which, in all probability, might have been unable to raise
finance from any other source) into investable propositions. Our review of
the pilot scheme indicates that it did enable businesses to raise finance
which they would otherwise have been unable to do so. Moreover, while
some of the participating businesses subsequently failed others have gone
on to raise significant amounts of new capital.
LINC Scotland’s investment facilitation approach to investment readiness has three further strengths. First, although the scheme has operated
on a modest scale, and will continue to do so, it has greater potential
for scaleability than other investment ready schemes which are delivered
by experts (professional service providers) whose numbers and time
availability are, by definition, finite. The Investment Facilitation Grant
scheme is based on tapping into the expertise of the business angel
community, which is substantial. That said, expansion of the scheme will
be limited by the availability of experienced early stage business angel
investors and the number of these angels who are willing to follow through

the Investment Facilitation Grant with an investment. Second, the scheme
would appear to be highly cost-effective, involving a low cost level of input
from the public purse and a high leverage of private finance, in terms of
company contribution, sponsorship to help cover administrative costs, and
investment funds from angels and angel syndicates, sometimes as part of
a larger financial package involving banks, and other investors. Third, the
scheme can help counteract the problem of ‘investment drift’ by angel
syndicates by offsetting some of their transaction costs (either directly, or
in terms of reimbursing some of the time of the syndicate manager).
Finally, although time will tell whether the approach is successful, the
modified version of the scheme, in which LINC Scotland will convert
their grant to equity in those situations when investments occur, indicates
how business angel network might be able to operate with minimal need
for public sector financial support.
