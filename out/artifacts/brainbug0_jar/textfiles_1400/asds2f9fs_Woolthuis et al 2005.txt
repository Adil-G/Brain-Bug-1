This article contributes to the debate on the relation between trust and control in the
management of inter-organizational relations. More specifically, we focus on the
question how trust and formal contract are related. While there have been studies on
whether trust and contract are substitutes or complements, they offer little insight into
the dynamic interaction between the two. They fail to answer, first, whether contract
precedes trust or follows it, in other words, what causal relationship exists between
the concepts; second, how and why trust and contract can substitute or complement
each other; and third, how the various combinations of trust and contract affect a
relationship’s development and outcome. In search of answers, we conducted longitudinal case studies to reveal the relationship between trust, contract and relationship
outcome in complex inter-firm relationships. We find trust and contract to be both
complements and substitutes and find that a close study of a contract’s content offers
alternative insight into the presence and use of contracts in inter-firm relationships.

According to classical transaction cost economics (TCE; see Williamson
1975, 1985), relations that entail specific investments create dependence and
vulnerability to opportunistic ‘hold-up’. Also, TCE argues that it is impossible
to reliably judge possible limits to other people’s opportunism and that trust
does not yield a reliable safeguard. From a social science perspective, many
people take the view that trust is viable and that it may be an important
element in the mitigation of relational risk (e.g. Macaulay 1963; Ouchi 1980;
Gambetta 1988; Gulati 1995; McAllister 1995; Chiles and McMackin 1996;
Nooteboom 1996). As Knights et al. (2001: 314) note, ‘a long tradition of
management thought conceptualizes trust and control as opposing alternatives’ in which high trust allows for limited formal control and vice versa.
However, empirical evidence about the relationship between trust and formal
control is mixed. Conceptual contributions, much in line with TCE thinking
and incomplete contracting theory, claim that legal regulation is an important
precondition for trust (Luhmann 1979; Zucker 1986). Empirical studies, on
the contrary, found that trust preceded contracts (Larson 1992) and higher
levels of formalization and vertical integration (Anderson and Narus 1990;
Zaheer and Venkatraman 1995; Poppo and Zenger 2002). In the words of

Lane (1998: 25) we may conclude that there is a ‘fundamental disagreement
in the literature’ on the relationship between trust and control.
This article contributes to this debate on the relationship between trust
and control in the management of inter-organizational relationships. More
specifically, we focus on contracts as a form of formal control. The key
question of this article is: How are trust and contract related? We will answer
this question by addressing the following sub-questions: Are trust and contract
complements or substitutes, or both? Does contract precede trust or does it
follow it? And how does this affect relationship development and performance? In view of the importance of relationship development in our analysis,
our unit of analysis is not a transaction, as in TCE, but the relationship in
which transactions arise and develop.
Before we proceed, we first define the key concepts — trust and contract
— since we believe that much disagreement in the current literature is likely
to be due to confusion over the definition of these concepts. Next, we discuss
the literature on the relationship between trust and contract. We then explain
the methodology for the empirical part of our study, and present the results.
Finally, we draw conclusions, discuss these conclusions and give suggestions
for further research.

Trust and Control

For a clear understanding of trust, we employ Nooteboom (2002). We have
to distinguish between competence trust and intentional trust. The first refers
to the trust one has in the technical, cognitive, organizational, and communicative competences of a partner. We focus on intentional trust, referring to
the trust one has in the intentions of a partner towards the relationship,
particularly in refraining from opportunism. Opportunism can have a
passive/weak and an active/strong form. The passive form entails lack of
dedication in performing to the best of one’s competences. The active form
of opportunism entails ‘interest seeking with guile’ (Williamson 1975); lying,
stealing and cheating to expropriate advantage from a partner. The absence
of such active opportunism is called ‘benevolence’ or ‘goodwill’. Thus, intentional trust has two dimensions: trust in dedication and trust in benevolence/
goodwill.
We propose that, like trust, control may be interpreted in a weak and in a
strong way. In a weak interpretation, control is regarded as any instrument or
condition that may mitigate relational risk. This could include trust. In a strong
form, control is seen as ‘deterrence’ (Maguire et al. 2001), i.e. in case of
opportunistic behaviour the partner incurs a penalty or material loss. In other
words, here control is based on power.
Based on the distinction between weak and strong forms of trust/
opportunism, control can be designed accordingly. Following Nooteboom
(1996) we suggest that relational risk may be mitigated in three ways: opportunity control, incentive control and benevolence (or goodwill). These three
ways of mitigating relational risk may be based on macro or universalistic

and micro or particularistic sources (Williams 1988; Nooteboom 2002;
Deutsch 1973; Shapiro 1987; Bachmann 1998), as shown in Table 1. Macro
sources are general and impersonal, aside from any specific exchange relation.
They arise from the institutional environment of laws, norms, values,
standards, and agencies for their enforcement.. This yields ‘institution-based’
or ‘thin’ trust. This kind of trust is based on the trust we have in those
institutions to support or enforce trustworthiness of people and organizations.
The micro sources arise in specific relations, are personalized and are referred
to as sources of ‘thick’ trust.
As Table 1 indicates, there are three ways of mitigating relational risk
(Nooteboom 1996). Opportunity control refers to the limitation of opportunities for opportunism by restricting the range of a partner’s actions. It has
an ‘outside form’ which refers to control of external partners by contract
(enforcement), and an ‘inside form’ within an organization which refers to
the exercise of ‘hierarchy’ and/or managerial ‘fiat’ under an employment
relationship. Both entail monitoring of behaviour to detect cheating, and
sanctions as a manner of enforcement.
Incentive control refers to the limitation of material incentives to utilize
opportunities for opportunism due to dependence on the relationship. In other
words, it refers to the situation that partner B behaves well towards A because
B is dependent on A (e.g. because A has a unique value to B), B faces
switching costs (e.g. as a result of relation-specific investments), or A holds
a hostage from B. The notion of specific investments is derived from TCE,
except that we consider the relation rather than the transaction as the unit of
analysis, and hence speak of relation-specific investments. In this, investments
may include the building of relation-specific mutual understanding and trust.
The notion of hostages is also taken from TCE. It mostly takes the form of
sensitive information that is of value to B, and is held by A, who can destroy,
divulge or transfer it to a competitor of B, if B does not behave well.
The third way of mitigating relational risk, benevolence, refers to the
limitation of inclinations towards opportunism based on established, socially
inculcated norms and values (macro), and empathy, identification, affect and
routines developed in specific relations (micro). The first includes pressures

of allegiance to groups one belongs to, and values and norms inculcated by
socialization into those groups. On the micro side, empathy entails that one
knows and understands how partners think and feel. It allows one to assess
strengths and weaknesses in competence and intentions, to determine the limits
of trustworthiness under different conditions (Nooteboom 2002). Identification
(McAllister 1995; Lewicki and Bunker 1996) goes even further: it entails that
people think and feel in the same way, sharing views of the world and norms
of behaviour. This may lead to affect- and friendship-based trust. Identification
may go so far that one is not able or willing to consider the possibility of
untrustworthiness, including cognitive dissonance. Routinization (Nooteboom
2002) emerges when a relation has been satisfactory for a while and awareness
of opportunities for opportunism is relegated to ‘subsidiary awareness’
(Polanyi 1962): one takes the relation for granted and does not continuously
think about opportunities to gain extra advantage from it, nor does one consider
the other to do so.
In this article, we investigate the relationship between formal contracts as
a source of control that can entail clauses for opportunity as well as incentive
control, and trust in its narrow interpretation, which is benevolence. Many
have claimed that trust can go beyond formal control, i.e. deterrence (Das and
Teng 1998; Williams 1988; Lane and Bachmann 1998; Maguire et al. 2001).
In line with these authors, we assume that ‘genuine’ trust is based on social
and personal foundations in which reciprocity and affective relations play a
role next to self-interested motivations. Recent empirical studies confirm this
by showing that roughly 40 to 50% of the people are completely selfish,
whereas others exhibit egalitarian preferences (they tend to equalize payoffs
among parties), surplus maximizing (those who try to maximize joint
outcomes even to their own disadvantage) or even altruistic preferences (Fehr
et al. 2001; Andreoni and Miller 2000; Charness and Rabin 2000). In other
words, the assumption that actors have an intrinsic tendency to keep promises
is as true as their likelihood to behave opportunistically (Chen 2000; MacNeil
1980; Macaulay 1963; Maguire et al. 2001). Apart from the fact that trust in
the narrow sense does exist, some authors have argued that there are also
conceptual reasons to use a narrow definition. Maguire et al. (2001: 286) argue
that if we use a broad definition we conflate trust and power. Similarly,
Williamson (1993) indicates that trust has no meaning if it does not go beyond
calculative self-interest, i.e. if benevolence and/or goodwill are absent.
Therefore we adopt the narrow definition of trust entailing the expectation
that a partner will not engage in opportunistic behaviour, even in the face
of opportunities and incentives for opportunism, irrespective of the ability
to monitor or control that party (McAllister 1995; Bradach and Eccles
1989; Chiles and McMackin 1996; Ring and Van de Ven 1994; Nooteboom
1996). This definition is felt to indicate better what most people would call
‘real trust’.

Contract

In the collaborative inter-firm relations that we focus on in this article, there
is no hierarchy that overarches the relationship. As a result, control of
opportunities and incentives for opportunism are reduced to contracts.
Classical contract theory defines formal contracts as agreements in writing
between two or more parties, which are perceived, or intended, as legally
binding (Lyons and Mehta 1997: 241). We follow this definition. Whereas
an agreement may take a variety of forms, written or verbal, implicit or explicit,
a formal contract refers to such an agreement in tightly written legal forms
(Lyons and Mehta 1997). Efficient outcomes are assumed when the contractual form rightly reflects the uncertainty, asset specificity and frequency of
the transaction (Williamson 1985). Contracts vary in the degree of completeness, i.e. some contracts contain more and more specific clauses (Chen 2000).
Complete contracts are more legally binding, because more clauses can cover
more aspects of the relationship and because more specific clauses are easier
to interpret and enforce. To be enforceable, clauses need to be specific because
general clauses are ‘... easily misinterpreted by the courts, which do not have
access to the specialized knowledge or assumptions shared by the parties’
(Deakin and Wilkinson 1998: 150). Incomplete contracts leave more open to
interpretation and are thus less legally binding because they contain fewer
clauses or because clauses are nor verifiable or observable (Chen 2000). In
relations that are characterized by high uncertainty and/or complexity, entail
specific investments and require intensive knowledge transfer (as is the case
in the relationships that we discuss in our empirical part), one would expect
at least clauses to safeguard (intellectual) property rights (ownership of
knowledge/product/method, patents, licences, right of publication) and spillover (pledge of secrecy, sanctions on spill-over, limitation of freedom to
work with other partners), and clauses on the management of the complex
relationship (relationship duration, project management, project plan i.e.
division of tasks, responsibilities, investments and time path, accountability,
conflict resolution or mediation, relationship termination) (Klein Woolthuis
1999; Blumberg 2001). A complete contract, in so far as that can be achieved,
will contain these clauses.

The Relationship Between Trust and Contract

Now that the notions of trust and contract have been clarified, we return to
the key question of this article, i.e. how are trust and contract related. We
distinguish three different views on the role of contracts and their influence
on trust. First, TCE and contract theory see contract as a basis for trust since
it limits the opportunities and incentives for opportunism. This enables parties
to trust each other, since they have no other option than to behave trustworthily (their opportunism will be at the cost of sanctions). Here contract
and trust are positively related, with contract as a prerequisite for trust.

Second, social scientists often envisage contract as ‘in conflict’ with trust.
Contracts can be detrimental to trust development since contracts can be
interpreted as a sign of distrust (Bradach and Eccles 1989; Neu 1991; Lyons
and Mehta 1997). Also, active use of the contract (e.g. by monitoring activities,
threat or litigation) may evoke conflict (Gaski 1984; Hunt and Nevin 1974;
Lusch 1976), opportunism (Goshal and Moran 1996) and defensive behaviour
(Zand 1972; Hirschman 1984). As a result more coercion will have to be used
(Goshal and Moran 1996). In the words of Deutsch (1973: 88): ‘Without the
other’s trust as an asset, power is essentially limited to the coercive and
ecological (i.e. conditional) types, the types that require and consume most in
the way of physical and economic resources.’ Taking this ‘dark side’ of contracts into consideration, we may conclude that it may not always be desirable
to completely specify and enforce a contract (Fehr et al. 2001; Fehr and
Schmidt 2002; Lyons and Mehta 1997; Chen 2000), especially since the
negative effects may not only materialize in the present, but also in future
relationships. If few alternative partners are available, the opportunity costs
of this may be very high; also, by indirect reputation, effects. Hence, in this
view, contract and trust are negatively related: the drawing up of a contract
reduces the level of existing trust and/or disables the development of trust.
The third interpretation of the relationship between trust and contract states
that trust and contract are negatively related, with trust preceding and
‘embedding’ relationships, thereby decreasing or eliminating the need for
formal control or contracts. This is echoed by, for instance, Bradach and
Eccles (1989), who argue that personal relationships can prevent opportunism
and can thus be seen as control mechanisms. In this view, trust precedes
contracts, and contracts can as a result become unnecessary.
In other words, the dominant conceptualization of trust and contract is that
of ‘opposing alternatives’ (Knights et al. 2001: 314) with contract leading to
less trust, and trust leading to decreased contract completeness. However,
empirical evidence about the relationship between trust and formal control is
mixed. On the one hand, studies found evidence that high trust and formal
control are found together and can be conceptualized as complementary
mechanisms in inter-firm relationships (Anderson and Narus 1990; Powell
1990; Zaheer and Venkatraman 1995; Poppo and Zenger 2002; Luo 2002) or
found trust to be a precondition for contracts (Larson 1992; Ring and Van de
Ven 1994). On the other hand, studies found evidence that trust was reducing
the need for contracting and monitoring and hence trust can be conceptualized
as substituting for formal control (Lyons and Mehta 1997; Das and Teng
1998). So, the ‘fundamental disagreement in the literature’ on the relationship
between trust and control (Lane 1998: 25) and the question how trust and
contract are related remain.
We propose that some of the conceptual differences of opinion, and the
diverging empirical results, are due to different interpretations of the notion
of trust. If trust is regarded in the wide sense, including trust based on contract,
then clearly trust and contract go together. On the other hand, detailed contract
specification and strict enforcement is likely to be in conflict with trust in the
narrow sense, based on benevolence. While such misunderstandings may

explain part of the confusion over the relationship between trust and contract,
they do not explain it completely. Trust and contract can still be seen as
both complements and substitutes and both make intuitive sense. However,
previous empirical research has failed to uncover how and why contracts and
trust substitute for and/or complement each other. In our opinion this is often
due to the research design. Most studies present quantitative and crosssectional data that can reveal the relation between trust and contract, but not
why this is the case, or how this has evolved. In order to go beyond conceptual
discussions on the interplay between contract and trust, we defined the
concepts in detail and subsequently designed a longitudinal empirical research
that allows us to look into the process of trust development and the drawing
up and use of contracts. Next we discuss the research method that we used,
and the findings of our empirical longitudinal case studies on relationship
development, to explore first whether contract precedes trust or follows it;
second, whether trust and contract substitute or complement each other in
relationship development; and third, how trust and contracts affect relationship performance.

Method

We used a case study methodology (Yin 1994) to gain insight into the relationship’s development and outcome to investigate the interaction between trust
and contract. Case research is very suitable for exploratory research where
understanding is the primary objective and the phenomenon to be investigated
is difficult to quantify, not well understood and needs to be studied within its
natural setting (Bonoma 1985; Yin 1994), as was the case here. Four cases
were selected from a larger study on inter-firm relationships in technical
innovation (Klein Woolthuis et al. 1999). As the degree of trust and contract
completeness are the two main variables in the research question, cases needed
to vary on these two variables. Therefore, we choose to explore our research
question on the basis of four cases that represent the extremes of low versus
high trust and low versus high contract completeness. Table 2 shows how the
cases are categorized according to these two selection criteria.
The cases dealt with collaborative innovation and hence involved complex
transactions for which close collaboration between partners was necessary
over a considerable period of time. The cases involved two or more legally
independent partners that shared costs and benefits more or less evenly. All

cases entailed uncertainty and/or complexity, and specific investments, and
hence risks of dependence, opportunism and ‘hold-up’.
Data sources: The highly proprietary character of the project data made it
impossible to speak to the companies directly. (For the same reason it is not
possible to refer to the real names of the companies in the case descriptions
below.) Therefore data were obtained from two other sources that were
triangulated to arrive at the final conclusions of our case study research (Denzin
1970). First, a rich selection of secondary data was collected. As all projects
received government subsidy, which required a detailed administration of the
project, the projects were very well monitored and documented. This provided
us with an important source of secondary data. The documents included the
contracts and agreements, project plans, annual reports of the companies
involved, and half-yearly project reports on the project’s progress (technological as well as financial data). Also, clippings from newspapers and trade
magazines concerning the projects and/or the collaborations were collected.
Every project was guided and monitored by a consultant, who visited the
companies on a yearly basis and mediated whenever needed. The visiting
reports from these consultants as well as all notes from their telephone contact
with the companies were included in the project file and hence analysis.
Second, we conducted four in-depth face-to-face interviews with each
consultant involved in the projects (16 interviews in total). Each interview took
about an hour and a half, and was especially focused on obtaining information
that could not be retrieved from the secondary data such as information about
trust development, conflict, and the relationship’s history. The interviews were
transcribed into interview reports. The four interviews allowed us, first, to
reconstruct the development of the project and the relationships, and second,
to check data obtained from the secondary data sources. Apart from the indepth interviews, the consultants were also personally contacted whenever
clarification was needed.
Case protocol and operationalization: To enable comparison between
cases and to ensure the quality of the case analysis, a case protocol was written
(Yin 1994), to describe the relationship’s history, development and outcome.
The central constructs of our research (trust, dependence, contract completeness, and relationship outcome) were measured using both secondary data
and in-depth interviews.
Trust was measured by asking the consultant his overall assessment of the
degree of trust, using the definition of trust as explained in the literature
section. We asked the consultants to explain their assessment, resulting in
detailed descriptions of the trust or distrust between the partners. Furthermore,
trust was discussed in the interviews with the consultant as a possible
explanation of how the relationships had developed, e.g. whether a breach of
trust had led parties to call on the consultant to mediate. We triangulated these
data with secondary data sources such as news clippings from an industry
journal and personal notes or letters that were sent to the consultant and
documented in the project file. All in all this provided us with an in-depth
and balanced insight into the social relationships between the partners
involved.

Dependence was measured because it determines whether trust and contracts
are relevant since, first, deterrence can be based on dependence making
contracts superfluous (private ordering), and second, lack of dependence makes
parties invulnerable to opportunistic behaviour, making both trust and contracts
unnecessary or even meaningless. Dependence was measured by evaluating
the size of the companies, the lock-in due to uniqueness of resources (technological knowledge, capabilities), uniqueness of partners (number of alternative
partners), and the switching costs due to asset specificity. This evaluation was
based on the project plan, companies’ annual reports, half-yearly project
evaluations and on the consultant’s inside knowledge. In particular, the project
plan provided detailed information on the level of the investments, how these
project-specific investments related to the company’s total R&D budget
(indicative of the importance of the project for the firm), and how the
investment of one company related to that of the partner firm (indicative of the
relative importance of the project for both firms). The project plan also provided
a detailed description of the unique, complementary resources of the partners
since these provided the reasons for starting the collaboration in the first place.
Contract completeness was measured by looking at the number of pages,
number and type of clauses, the type of contract (standard versus custommade), and the detail in which the clauses were worked out. We also
investigated to what degree parties engaged in monitoring, and had actually
used the contract to enforce behaviour. As described in the theoretical section
on contracts, we expected at least clauses on, first, safeguarding the parties’
(intellectual) property rights, second, safeguarding spill-over, and third,
clauses to manage the complex, long-term relationship. We examined the
content of the contracts with respect to whether these clauses were laid down
in the contract, and to what degree of detail these clauses had been worked
out. Contracts with many clauses that were specified in detail (e.g. including
specifications of sanctioning) were classified as very complete, whereas
contracts with only a few or very general clauses (e.g. only indicating intentions, no deadlines or sanctions) were classified as incomplete. We chose this
very detailed approach, since earlier studies that relied solely on ‘counting
clauses’ did not find a clear relationship between trust and contract completeness. We therefore included an analysis of what exactly was written in the
clauses in order to reveal the intentions with which the contract was written
and used by the partners. No classification of the types of clauses and function
of these clauses was made beforehand, allowing the function of the contract
to emerge from the data.
Finally, since we investigated not only the relationship between trust and
contract, but also their influence on relationship development and outcome
(to test TCE reasoning that reliance on trust would be unwise), an assessment
of the outcome of the project was needed. For this we measured, first, the
technological success of the project, second, the degree to which the project
remained within budget and time schedule, and third, the degree to which
partners were able to solve problems within the relationship. Data on the
project’s success could be retrieved from the half-yearly project evaluations
that gave detailed progress reports on these items, from the evaluations that

were conducted by the consultant based on these reports and their regular
company visits, and on the additional information retrieved in the interviews
with the consultants.
Data analysis: With the available secondary data, we reconstructed the
development of the relationship and investigated the relationship between
trust and contract, as well as their influence on the relationship’s success. For
this, we made use of qualitative data analysis techniques: we drew up a matrix
of categories and placed evidence within these categories (all information on
our key constructs), and we put all information in chronological order (to
reconstruct developments in time) (Miles and Huberman 1994). We discussed
this analysis with the consultants to arrive at a realistic representation of
the developments as observed ‘in real time’ by the consultant. The result
of this phase was an extensive description and analysis of the relationship’s
development.
The final analysis of the cases started with carefully re-reading all
secondary data as well as the interviews reports from the in-depth interviews
with the consultants. These texts were divided into meaningful text fragments,
which were coded to reflect their relationship with key concepts of our study.
Based on this analysis a rich and detailed description of each individual case
was written. In order to check the accuracy of the final case description and
conclusions derived from it, we had another feedback session with the consultants to discuss the case.
Important for the interpretation of the results is the fact that the cases
described concern relationships between Dutch companies. Their trusting and
contracting behaviour will thus reflect the Dutch (or broader continental
European) culture in which ‘voice’ is the prevalent option for solving problems and cases are seldom taken to court (Bachmann 1998). This may explain
why in the four cases, despite conflicts and sometimes complete and
enforceable contracts, none of them went to court.

Results

In this section a description of the four cases is presented. Each case
description starts, after a short introduction, with a characterization of the
project in terms of degree of trust, dependence, and contract (i.e. completeness
and content of the clauses). Next, we describe how the project evolved and
whether the project was successful or not. Finally, a conclusion on each
individual case is presented. To give a short introduction to the cases, Table
3 summarizes the cases on the key dimensions.
The Petfood Case

In December 1989, FoodCom, a large producer and seller of specialty foods,
and Processor, an international firm specializing in developing a wide range
of food ingredients, decided to jointly develop a new enzyme for a specialty
petfood that would be a strategic new product in FoodCom’s product range.

The parties knew each other from another collaborative project two years
earlier and were complementary in the sense that Processor provided (basic)
research outcomes which FoodCom implemented in its production process.
Degree of trust: Although the relationship built on an earlier project, the
consultant told us that there was little trust between the partners:
‘The people do not get on. The cultural differences are large, just as the gap between
their levels of scientific knowledge. That of Processor is high, whereas Foodcom is
mainly interested in direct application of new ingredients. This results in the parties
not understanding each other and not getting along.’

Also, the consultant indicated that in the previous project Processor had
been sloppy in its execution of the project, which led FoodCom to become
distrustful with regard to Processor’s intentions towards a new collaborative
project.
Dependence: The reason that the partners did cooperate again was due
to FoodCom’s dependence on Processor’s specialist knowledge, for which
FoodCom had very few alternative partners to turn to. Once the project had
started, this dependence increased since the petfood project was of strategic
importance for FoodCom and they had invested a large proportion of their
R&D budget in it. Processor, on the contrary, was relatively independent: the
project’s level of knowledge development was more or less standard for them,
and their investment in the project was only a fraction of their R&D budget
(around 1%). The project was hence characterized by highly asymmetrical
dependence from the start.
Contract: As a result of its vulnerable position and negative earlier
experiences, FoodCom had serious concerns that Processor would behave
opportunistically again, and thus placed much emphasis on contract negotiations to ensure that legally enforceable safeguards would be installed. The
resulting very detailed and complete contract mainly focused on legally
enforceable clauses on safeguarding (intellectual) property rights and spillover (property and publication rights, secrecy of information, limitations of
cooperation with other parties, and patent rights). The contract also included
less enforceable clauses on the project’s management (e.g. project plan,
project management, meeting frequency). In the contract it was explicitly
stated that Processor should provide assistance with the implementation of

the enzyme in FoodCom’s production process. Interviews with the consultant
revealed that this was included in the contract because, in the earlier project,
Processor had been seen to lose interest in collaborating as soon as they had
achieved their goal (knowledge development). They had then failed to see
the implementation process as a joint responsibility.
Process and outcome: Despite the detailed and complete contract,
Processor started shirking after they had developed and patented the new
enzyme in 1992. They skipped project meetings, replaced their project leader
three times within a year and refused to help FoodCom with the implementation of the enzyme in their production process. While FoodCom faced great
difficulties with this implementation and badly needed help from Processor,
the latter informally ceased cooperation because they had achieved their
individual goal and used up all their budget in 1993. FoodCom then tried to
enforce the contract by turning to the consultant and referring to the explicit
agreements that had been laid down in the contract. The consultant tried to
mediate but concluded that both companies found it difficult to cooperate
with each other. When the consultant visited Foodcom in August 1993,
Foodcom stated: ‘Processor in general takes implementation problems
much too lightly. They do not help us to solve problems. They just supply
the enzymes while we face great difficulties with implementing these
enzymes.’ FoodCom asked the consultant to mediate and use its authority to
make Processor stick to the formal contract. However, Processor ignored both
the contract and the mediation, and unilaterally ceased cooperation without
helping FoodCom. Hence, FoodCom also had to halt the project after the first
tests of the enzyme’s implementations showed that there were many technical
hurdles to be overcome. They stopped buying Processor’s enzymes, but did
not take the case to court. They knew they would need Processor’s specialist
knowledge again in future projects. Two years later, in 1995, they collaborated again on a new project.
Conclusion: To a large extent, this case illustrates what one would expect
on the basis of TCE. In the presence of high one-sided dependence and
expectations of opportunism, the hazards involved should be safeguarded by
detailed formal contracts. Because FoodCom did not trust Processor, and
lacked private ordering mechanisms (e.g. mutual dependence or hostages),
a complete formal contract was the only credible safeguard. According to
contracting theory, this should produce efficient outcomes. However, this
proved not to be the case: the project was characterized by high ex-ante and
ex-post transaction costs because of the detailed contract, haggling, conflict,
mediation, etc., and the project did not result in the planned outcome.
In this case, distrust preceded the process of extensive contracting,
illustrating the general view that trust and contracts are negatively related.
Here fear of opportunism is the main reason to put emphasis on a formal,
enforceable contract that, however, does not increase the level of trust
between the parties. Judging from the type of clauses, we conclude that the
main function of the contract was to safeguard the parties’ interests. However,
the contract could not prevent Processor from behaving opportunistically,
even though trilateral governance through mediation supported it. Due to its

825

dependence on Processor, FoodCom could not risk a break in the long-term
relationship by taking the case to court. In our interpretation, the case
therefore illustrates that contracts may not work when they are needed most,
i.e. in the case of asymmetric dependence. This case seems to suggest that
under asymmetric dependence, where there is an increased (and justifiable)
fear of opportunism, a contract will logically entail clauses that focus on
safeguarding (with detailed enforceable clauses on property rights and spillover), but also that these contracts may not be enforceable if they are not
complemented with other governance instruments, such as mutual dependence and trust. Processor acted without any regard for the interests of
FoodCom and showed no loyalty, decency or morality, which they might
have showed if bonds of trust and friendships had existed.
The Biowrap Case

In 1992, an industrial designer (from now on called Designer) won first prize
at a design trade fair in Tokyo with her invention: a biologically degradable
wrapping material. Encouraged by this success, Designer approached large
retailers to buy her product in 1993. However, they were only interested if the
product could be mass produced. To meet this requirement, Designer needed
partners that could help her with the technical production aspects and with
additional money for product and process development. For this, she called
on two ‘old friends’ with whom she had worked before, who were also
independent entrepreneurs. One was a graduate of a technical university,
who could provide knowledge on product development and production
processes. The other was also an industrial designer, but with more experience
and financial resources than Designer, so that she could provide guidance and
money. Their cooperation began in 1994.
Degree of trust: In this case trust had been built up in earlier cooperative
projects, both in competences and intentions. The three entrepreneurs visited
the consultant together to promote their joint project. They told the consultant
about their shared history in which they had successfully acquired and
conducted projects together for large clients. In these projects, the partners
had found each other to be competent and loyal. The new project was the first
project to be developed at their own risk and responsibility, but they stressed
that their successful earlier experiences made them confident that they could
jointly achieve success again. This leads us to the conclusion that the project
started with a high level of trust. This remained so during the project’s
execution. On several occasions during the project the consultant observed
that the partners were willing to help each other out and to be flexible, without
any intention of opportunism. Also, the consultant characterized the cooperation as friendly and constructive in all phases of the project.
Dependence: All partners were highly dependent on the project, as the
entrepreneurs had invested their personal money in the project and depended
on the project’s success for their personal income. Also, asset-specific
investments were made in this project (raw materials, moulds, knowledge,
feasibility study) that the partners could not use for other purposes. According

<-----Page 14----->826

Organization Studies 26(6)

to the consultant, the partners are complementary in nature and have, in
their previous relationships, learned to respect each other’s expertise and to
divide tasks accordingly. The costs of the project were shared equally between
the designers.
Contract: The partners explicitly stated to the consultant that they regarded
the Biowrap project as just one step further in a long process of recurrent
collaboration. They did not put any effort into contract negotiations. Instead,
they simply used the standard contract provided by the government agency.
This resulted in a two-page contract that mainly included general, nondetailed clauses: a letter of intent (brief statement about the relationship and
a project plan) and a statement in which they agreed to share potential benefits
equally among the partners. No detailed legal enforceable clauses were
included on project ownership, sharing of benefits and proprietary knowledge.
Process and outcome: During the development of the product, substantial
technical problems occurred repeatedly. In 1996 problems with the raw
materials delayed the project, and later technical problems with processing
the materials gave additional problems. Also, negotiations with several
important potential customers did not lead to concrete sales. Despite these
problems, the partners managed to successfully finish the project within the
set time frame and at lower costs than expected. Furthermore, the end of
the project did not entail the end of their cooperation: after this project they
continued cooperating in various other projects.
Conclusion: In view of the high risks for the partners and the importance
of the project, TCE and contracting theory would suggest that the partners
either safeguard against opportunism in a complete contract or integrate
operations in a single firm to ensure a good outcome of the relationship.
However, the relationship was highly successful without the partners using
these safeguarding mechanisms. This observation does not necessarily contradict TCE: one might argue that partners were lucky with their prosperous and
conflict-free relationship and that the necessity of a contract would have
proven itself if conflict had occurred. However, this case shows that good
outcomes cannot be ascribed to unspecified luck: the partners consciously
built on their prior, trusting relationship. The consciousness of this process
also means that trust was not blind: previous collaboration and personal
bonding provided the cognitive and affective basis on which the partners
developed trust in each other’s competences and intentions. Furthermore,
their relationship was not without trouble and could have caused just as much
conflict as the petfood case described earlier. We conclude that in the Biowrap
case, trust formed the basis for constructively solving problems. This supports
the views of Sabel (1993) and Six (2003) that problems and even conflict do
not necessarily break down trust. Instead, the joint resolution or redefinition
of conflict can deepen trust.
In sum, this case illustrates the prevailing idea in the sociological literature
on inter-organizational relationships that trust can substitute for complete
contracts and become a superior governance mechanism due to the positive
‘side effects’ such as constructively solving conflicts and loyalty. In particular,
it supports Shapiro’s view of the development of trust (1987: 625):

827

‘Typically ... social exchange relations evolve in a slow process, starting with minor
transactions in which little trust is required because little risk is involved and in which
partners can prove their trustworthiness, enabling them to expand their relation and
engage in major transactions.’

It also illustrates that in such an atmosphere a contract can obtain a function
that differs from enforcement and can even be interpreted as a sign of
commitment as reflected in the types of clauses included in the contract in
the present case. Thus, contracts are not always a sign of distrust as claimed
by Bradach and Eccles (1989) and Macaulay (1963). Rather, parties may have
different intentions with drawing up and using contracts.
The Wrapline Case

A small entrepreneurial company (Entrepreneur) and a large production
company (Producer) jointly wanted to develop a packaging machine (the
Wrapline) for electronic components for the information and communication
technology industry, to be sold by Entrepreneur. Producer would make the first
series of the packaging machine based on the specifications and knowledge
provided by Entrepreneur. The latter was highly specialized in process
development and possessed a number of worldwide patents in this field. It
was an aggressive, fast-growing company: in a period of two years, from 1993
to 1995, the company grew from 5 to 35 highly skilled employees. Producer
specialized in the production of machinery and tools. It was a subsidiary of
a large Dutch electronics company, with a long history and traditional culture.
Its age was reflected in its bureaucratic and hierarchical manner of doing
business. Entrepreneur and Producer had previously cooperated on a joint
production basis. In this project, Entrepreneur would provide the specifications and knowledge for Producer to make the first series of packaging
machines.
Degree of trust: While the two partners had cooperated before, no
empathetic and trusting relationship had been formed. Although no specific
problems had occurred, the collaboration took place on the basis of rational
business interest only. The interviews indicate that this was also the case in
the new project. The consultant notes:
‘The owner/manager of Entrepreneur is an opportunistic entrepreneur. He is not
interested in developing a long-lasting relationship and does not want to be tied down
to one partner. He is “shopping around” to realize his individual goals as fast as
possible.’

Furthermore, the companies had very different company cultures, which
made it hard to identify with each other; Entrepreneur was small, fast and
flexible, whereas Producer was bureaucratic, slow and hierarchical.
Dependence: One would expect Entrepreneur to be the dependent partner.
After all, Entrepreneur was much smaller, still in its starting phase, and
could certainly use the financial resources of Producer for the project. Also,
Entrepreneur had large strategic interests in the project as large, international
chip manufacturers had shown interest in the Wrapline, which meant there was

<-----Page 16----->828

Organization Studies 26(6)

a large potential market for Entrepreneur. Yet, its dependence was limited:
because of its specialist knowledge and its possession of patents, Entrepreneur
had many alternative partners to turn to. As the parties had agreed that Producer
would get all future production orders if the collaboration was successful and
the Wrapline sold, Producer did have a considerable interest in the project.
Also, Producer had made transaction-specific investments, though, relative to
Producer’s size, these interests were modest. We can hence conclude that there
is moderate dependence of both parties.
Contract: Producer and Entrepreneur hardly negotiated their contract and
just used the standard buyer–supplier contract provided by Producer. This
contract did not include clauses to guide their shared investments and benefits.
There were no clauses on safeguarding intellectual property rights or spillover. The contract was stated in very general terms, only specifying the
investments and tasks of both parties. The interviews reveal that Producer did
not fear opportunism when it negotiated the contract because of its size,
dominant position in the industry and earlier experience with Entrepreneur.
As a result, Producer did not give the contract much thought and used its
standard buyer–supplier contract. Entrepreneur did not put much emphasis
on the completeness of the contract either. The owner-manager did not want
to be tied down by a detailed contract and opportunistically kept his options
open for alternative partners, as was stated by the consultant of the government agency as well as by the report of an independent commercial consultant
who evaluated the relationship ex-post in 1996. This resulted in a very
incomplete contract that did not safeguard against opportunism and did not
take the specificities of the relationship into account.
Process and outcome: The project got off to an enthusiastic start by
Entrepreneur in 1993. All its employees (six in total) joined the first project
meetings, whereas there was only one representative from Producer. Soon
after, though, Entrepreneur ran into liquidity problems. It therefore decided to
postpone the project to meanwhile finish another project. When these problems
were solved, they continued their collaboration with Producer. In 1994 the
feasibility study was finished and a first patent was applied for. Since the
feasibility study revealed that the current design would not be economically
feasible, the specifications for the packaging machine were changed, and
consequently the project was delayed. Because of the delay, and the fastchanging requirements, cracks began to show in the collaboration. Producer
could not adapt its production capacity in a timely manner because of its
bureaucratic culture, nor did they really try to, because the project did not have
the same priority for them as it had for Entrepreneur. Because Entrepreneur
wanted to keep up a fast pace of developments, they started to look for
an alternative partner, however, without first discussing this with Producer or
giving them a chance to speed up the project. The consultant recalls:
‘From the start, the decision makers of the companies did not get along. The
relationship was definitively broken when Entrepreneur invited a bid for the adapted
packaging machine from an alternative producer, without first discussing or even
telling this to Producer. In my view, a lack of both cultural fit and mutual business
interest add up and explain the failure of the relationship.’

829

As it turned out on several occasions, the large cultural differences
(flexibility versus bureaucracy) made it hard for the partners to understand
each other’s working procedures and to sympathize with each other. The
relationship between Entrepreneur and Producer ended in 1995, without
achieving the goals that the parties had wanted.
Conclusion: Considering the specific investments that had to be made in
this project (especially on the side of Entrepreneur), and the high risk and
complexity of joint development, both TCE and contracting theory would
have suggested a highly specified contract to safeguard at least property rights
and spill-over. Instead, a standard buyer–supplier contract was used that
included neither detailed nor specific clauses. Entrepreneur did not insist upon
a fully specified contract since they valued the flexibility of options and
Producer did not give the contract much thought. As a result, the contract did
not provide a source to fall back on when the relationship broke up. There
was also no trusting, loyal relationship to complement the contract, which
made it difficult for the partners to solve the problems together.
Although one might argue that considering the limited dependence of the
partners, extensive safeguards were not needed, the carelessness of both
Producer and Entrepreneur remains surprising. This might partly be ascribed
to the fact that the partners had cooperated before and doubts of the other’s
trustworthiness might have been relegated to subsidiary awareness (Polanyi
1962). One might also conclude that Producer exhibited a certain arrogance:
they considered themselves invulnerable because of their size, age and
reputation and hence did not make the effort to draw up a specific contract.
In sum, this case shows that the absence of a fully specified contract, in spite
of specific investments, may be explained not by mutual trust as one might
expect, but quite to the contrary, by the fact that a party’s high propensity
towards opportunism leads him ‘to leave the back door open’ or by the
fact that routinized behaviour reduces a party’s alertness. In sum, this case
did not illustrate a substituting relationship between trust and contract, nor a
complementary one.
Pharm Venture

In January 1993 two large international players in the pharmaceutical
industry, Syntecs and Curex, started official negotiations on the joint
development of a biodegradable antibiotic because of increasingly stringent
government regulations. One had specialist knowledge and good access to
raw materials; the other had complementary specialist knowledge and a very
strong market position. Together they wanted to set a new standard and
achieve technological leadership in the world market. In doing so, they were
racing against large competitors in countries such as Japan and the United
States.
Degree of trust: When Syntecs and Curex started negotiating their
partnership, they already had a long and trusting relationship. The history
of their relationship was described extensively in an industry journal in
November 1993. Syntecs had been looking for a strategic partner for new

Organization Studies 26(6)

drug development since 1983. They had taken a number of partners into
consideration to become their strategic partner over these years. During this
period, negotiations took place on an informal basis and focused mainly
on evaluating the competences and trustworthiness of the potential partners.
One ‘flirtation’ led to a joint venture with another large company, but this
relationship was dissolved after they realized that their cultures did not match.
After 10 years of talking with Curex, both partners strongly believed in the
potential of their relationship, which resulted in the current project. They
referred to the project as the formalization of their trust in each other and even
called it an ‘engagement’. They explain: ‘We feel that this relationship has a
better chance since our cultures match and especially our personal chemistry
is right’ (industry journal, November 1993). The partners explicitly mentioned
their trust to be a factor of utmost importance in their decision to collaborate
and stated that their ultimate goal was to establish a joint venture, which they
consequently saw as their ‘marriage’. The interviews confirmed the high
levels of trust and the long process of trust building. We hence conclude that
this relationship started in a highly trusting atmosphere.
Dependence: For both parties the development of the new antibiotic formed
a large and important project. Both invested substantially: the total investment
of approximately €3m was shared evenly. Considering the highly specific
investments in the project, the high relation-specific investment in a 10-year
relationship build-up, the great strategic value of the project, and the strong
complementarity (and limited number of alternative partners for such a
relationship), we may conclude that mutual dependence was high.
Contract: The high level of trust did not prevent the partners from drawing
up an extensive contract and, at a later stage, using unified governance (a joint
venture) to formalize the relationship. They signed a letter of intent in March
1993 to confirm their intentions to cooperate, and in November 1993, after
10 months of contract negotiations and a positive outcome of the feasibility
study, the partners signed a formal contract. The contract contained all
expected clauses, which were specified in great detail. The clauses focusing
on safeguarding property rights and spill-over included, for instance, cost
sharing (50/50), secrecy of information, ownership, division of labour,
duration of cooperation, and a procedure for relationship termination.
In addition, clauses on project management were specified such as meeting
frequency and management of the project. In January 1994 their relationship
was further formalized in the 50/50 joint venture BiCom. Through BiCom
they executed collaborative projects with four Dutch universities in related
fields, making it a joint venture that fitted with their expansion strategy and
facilitating administration of collaborative projects with the universities.
Process and outcome: The development of the new antibiotic was not at
all without problems. During the first half of 1994 there were start-up
problems. During the consultant’s first company visit, the parties told him
that the start of the collaboration was suffering from miscommunication. The
partners had to get acquainted with each other’s ways of working and
communicating. In the course of 1995, technical problems delayed the project,
which led parties to ‘stretch’ their original time plan. Complexity also forced

831

the partners to invest more time and money than planned. However, they
jointly solved their communication and technical problems and were flexible
and cooperative in allocating more time and money to the project. This led
to a delayed but good result: by September 1995 four patents were applied
for, and in August 1996 the partners developed a concrete plan for production
and economic exploitation of the new drug.
Conclusion: This case shows a combination of high trust and complete
contracts (and even unified governance) and hence illustrates that trust
and contract can be positively related, in a complementary fashion. It also
illustrates a process in which trust preceded a detailed formal contract, which
makes one wonder why the partners drew up such complete contracts despite
the presence of high levels of trust. In other words, why did trust not substitute
for contract, as in the Biowrap case? A first explanation may lie in the fact
that the Biowrap case was between small entrepreneurial firms that might in
general have less tendency to formalize their agreements. However, looking
at the process that evolved during the Pharm Venture case, we can derive a
richer explanation and learn more about the dynamics and complex interaction
of trust and contract.
When we look at the order of things, we see that a long period of trust
building preceded the formalization of the relationship. This finding contradicts claims that formal contracts would form the basis for (in other words,
would precede) trust (Lewicki and Bunker 1996). In TCE reliance on a partner
follows from control, based on confidence in institutions (e.g. courts), one’s
power, and other external sources that would prevent opportunism. Contracts
clearly have a different function and meaning in TCE from the one found in
this case. Here, the contract, however formal and detailed, was not primarily
intended to safeguard against opportunism, because the partners clearly
believed in each other’s benevolence. Rather, the contract was a sign of
commitment (as can be concluded from the proud announcement of their
‘engagement’ in the media by the partners themselves) and a tool for
coordination, simply to avoid misunderstanding in the project’s management
(comparable to minutes of a meeting). Another function is safeguarding
against unforeseen contingencies. Whereas safeguarding against opportunism
is aimed at potential non-cooperative behaviour by the partner, contingencies
refer to conditions that are beyond the control of the partners, but that can
still influence the relationship (such as technological and market development
and bankruptcy of an important supplier). In this case, the partners do not
seem to consider opportunistic behaviour, but do consider the contingencies
that may affect the relationship that will continue over a considerable period
of time and hence contains many uncertainties.
It is interesting, with regard to our question on whether trust precedes or
follows contracts, that this case shows that prior trust may be needed and
used, first, to enable open communication and negotiations on the details
of the contract, including the thorny sensitive clauses like relationship
termination, without evoking a feeling of distrust and conflict, and second,
for partners to be willing to engage in the expensive and specific investment
in a detailed contract. In this interpretation, trust serves as a basis for detailed

<-----Page 20----->832

Organization Studies 26(6)

contracting, whereas the contract is seen as deriving from trust. In earlier
research it was found that trust can be a basis for both relationship and its
outcome (Ring and Van de Ven 1994). Here, we find the same for formal
contracts. The results of this case support earlier empirical work by, for
example, Zaheer and Venkatraman (1995) who found a positive relationship
between trust and formalization or unified control but could not explain these
findings due to a lack of insight into the dynamics and into what came first
— trust or contract — and how these influenced each other in the relationship.
Our results do uncover the complex interaction between trust and contract in
relationship development, and thereby reveal how trust and contract can go
‘hand in hand’.

Conclusion

Results from earlier research were ambiguous about the relationship between
trust and contract, and about the effect both would have on relationship
outcome. Therefore this study set out to uncover how contract and trust relate
to each other, and how this affects relationship outcome. While the limited
number of cases in our study urges us to be careful in drawing conclusions,
our study does support and in other cases contradicts earlier findings and,
most importantly, provides insights that question common beliefs on the
relationship between trust, contract and relationship outcome.
The Biowrap case illustrates the relationship, much hypothesized by
sociologists, that trust can successfully substitute contracts (e.g. Bradach and
Eccles1989; Macaulay 1963). Based on their trust relationship, the partners
in this case made use of a very incomplete contract, and still had a most
efficient and successful relationship. This outcome contradicts TCE and
contract theory reasoning that one should optimally safeguard a relationship
to achieve efficient outcomes (e.g. Williamson 1985). We additionally argue
that this case shows that a contract can be interpreted as a sign of commitment
and tool for coordination.
The petfood case shows that a contract is not always effective in reaching
good outcomes. In this case, the extensive contract could not safeguard
FoodCom’s interests nor guarantee relationship success. We conclude that
contracts may be a poor ordering mechanism in the case of one-sided dependence, which is precisely the situation where contracts are needed most.
It illustrates that a contract may not be enforceable because of other than
technical legal reasons (e.g. enforceable clauses, availability of courts). Social
considerations (e.g. reputation, the will to keep a friendly relationship) and
the shadow of the future (one might need the partner again) may make it
undesirable to enforce a contract. This finding supports MacNeil’s claim that
contracts, as presumed in classical and neo-classical economics, do not
actually exist because they are cut loose from their social context and meaning
(MacNeil 1980: 1), and contradicts both TCE and contract theory reasoning
that contracts form an effective safeguard (e.g. Chen 2000; Lyons and Mehta
1997; Williamson 1985).

833

The Pharm Venture case illustrates how trust and contract can complement
and mutually reinforce each other. This finding contradicts the ‘substitution’
hypotheses as described by, for example, Neu (1991) and Lyons and Mehta
(1997). How and why trust and contract complement each other can be understood when looking at the process. The case illustrates that trust may be
needed as a precondition for negotiating and drawing up a complex contract.
First, to prevent distrust: in a complex, intended long-lasting relationship,
partners have to discuss the potential hazards of a relationship and agree how
they deal with this. To come to a fair and effective agreement on these issues,
parties have to compromise and trust each other’s intentions. Prior trust may
provide the basis for openness and psychological safety (Edmonson 1999)
that is needed to negotiate these sensitive issues (e.g. relationship termination
or sharing costs in case things go wrong) and prevent the triggering of a
vicious circle of mutual distrust, defensive behaviour and conflict. This
contradicts earlier contributions which claimed that emphasis on contracting
would lead to a spiral of distrust, defensive behaviour, conflict and increased
emphasis on monitoring and control (e.g. Goshal and Moran 1996; Gaski
1984; Hunt and Nevin 1974; Lusch 1976). Second, prior trust may be needed
for the parties to be willing to invest in the relationship: since a contract may
entail a lot of effort, and by itself constitutes a specific investment, prior trust
may be needed to ensure that this effort will be successful and worthwhile.
If the contract is viewed in this light, signing the contract can be interpreted
as a sign of trust and commitment to the relationship. This supports Bacherach
and Gambetta’s (2001) claim that contracts can also be interpreted as signals.
The Wrapline case, finally, illustrates that the absence of complete contracts
cannot always be interpreted as a sign of trust. Here, it was the result of
Entrepreneur’s inclination to opportunism and hence wish to keep ‘the back
door open’ that led to an ill-suited, incomplete contract.
The cases show that the relationship between trust and contract is a
complex and dynamic one, and that in a trusting atmosphere contracts can
have a different function and meaning. Whereas companies that fear opportunism view their contract as a safeguard against opportunism, companies
that have a trusting relationship tend to interpret contracts as a tangible
expression of trust that has been built up over the years. More specifically,
and returning to the questions addressed in the introduction, we conclude the
following.
Do contracts precede trust or vice versa? Based on our results we conclude
that trust will in general precede contracts. In the Pharm Venture we saw how
trust enabled detailed complete contracting. This supports the findings of, for
example, Larson (1992) and Ring and Van de Ven (1994) who, by looking
at the process of inter-organizational relationship development, found that
trust was an important precondition for contracts. We saw no example of
contract providing a basis for trust. This contradicts the claim by, for example,
Luhmann (1979), Zucker (1986), Zaheer and Venkatraman (1995) and
Anderson and Narus (1990), that legal regulation is an important precondition
for trust. We can explain this contradictory result by coming back to our
definition of trust that explicitly distances itself from the rational calculative

interpretation of trust. We argue that, although calculative trust may be based
on legal regulation, this will form a poor basis for the interpersonal care,
concern and benevolence that characterizes the deep trust that we investigated
in this study. Moreover, the petfood case also contradicts the claim that
rational trust can always be based on complete contracts.
Are contracts and trust complements or substitutes? We conclude that trust
and contracts can be both substitutes and complements. The Biowrap case
illustrated how trust enabled the contract to be left incomplete and flexible,
thereby supporting the ‘substitution’ hypothesis of trust and contract. The
Pharm Venture case illustrated that trust and contract can also complement and
mutually reinforce each other. We argue that whether contracts and trust are
substitutes or complements depends on the intentions with which contracts
are drawn up and used. First, if a contract is not interpreted as a strict legal
safeguard, trust and contract may go well hand in hand, in which case trust and
contract will be complementary. Second, when parties trust each other, they
may decide not to include safeguarding clauses in their contract, in which case
trust substitutes for contract. Third, in situations of high distrust, parties may
put great emphasis on contracts and detailed safeguarding clauses, in which
case contract substitutes for trust.
How do trust and contract relate to a relationship’s success or failure?
Although we have to be careful with our conclusions in view of the limited
number of cases we studied, we found that relationships characterized by trust
were more successful. This supports earlier claims by social scientists that
trust is an important condition to create an open and constructive atmosphere
(e.g. Zand 1972; Larson 1992; Ring and Van de Ven 1994). In such an
atmosphere, parties will likely share information in a more timely manner
and more accurately, signal problems earlier, and jointly solve problems as
they arise. In these cases, conflict does not necessarily harm the relationship
or the level of trust. On the contrary, the joint resolution of problems and
conflict may deepen the relationship and increase the level of trust. These
findings were illustrated in the Biowrap and Pharm Venture cases (problems
were successfully solved and execution of the projects was both effective
and efficient) and support earlier findings by Six (2003) and Sabel (1993)
who described how conflict is dealt with in a trusting relationship. We did
not find an example of how a contract can guarantee success. The petfood
case illustrated that, despite the complete contract, a good outcome could not
be achieved.
We conclude that, looking at the relationship’s development, the exact
content of contracts and intentions with which these contracts were drawn up
and used provides an increased understanding of how trust and contract are
related. Key to this understanding is that the general conceptualization of
contracts as uni-dimensional legal safeguarding instruments is wrong. Our
cases show that contracts may have different functions, which can also be
social in nature. These functions may be reflected in the content of clauses
included in the contract. This study has uncovered three additional functions
of contracts.

Coordination: In a trusting atmosphere, where parties do not fear
opportunism, a contract may be used to specify what goals parties aim for
and how they want to achieve these goals, as in the Pharm Venture and
Biowrap cases. This contract may be very detailed but will generally focus
more on the positive (what we want to achieve and how) than on the
negative (which legally enforceable measure we put in place to safeguard
property or knowledge and how we take the case to court). Such a contract
can be interpreted as a technical aid to managing the relationship, in the
same way that minutes of a meeting remind participants of arrangements
that were made.
Safeguard for contingencies: When parties engage in a long-term and
complex relationship, parties may put a detailed contract into place to
have a framework for how to (re)act if unforeseeable contingencies occur.
These contingencies do not refer to unforeseen opportunism, but to
outside contingencies such as technical or economic developments,
a hostile take-over of one of the partners, bankruptcy of a partner, or
accidents. The very detailed and complete contract in the Pharm Venture
case can be seen as an illustration of this function.
Sign of commitment: Partners may also use the contract as a tangible
expression of their trust in each other and their intention to be loyal
partners (see Biowrap and Pharm Venture cases). In these cases the
contract can partly be interpreted as a symbol, or a signal (Bacherach and
Gambetta 2001) for showing commitment.

Mostly contracts will contain a mixture of clauses and serve a number of
functions. The analysis should hence not be understood as an ‘either–or’
discussion, with contracts having, for example, either a symbolic or a
safeguarding function. Contracts will be mixed, but at the same time, be
directed towards one or the other function, which will be reflected in the
clauses included. In this sense, one could claim that contracts may be
envisaged as the sedimentation of the negotiation and commitment stages that
partners go through. In this interpretation contracts can, like trust, be seen as
both the basis and outcome of cooperation. In a trusting atmosphere, negotiating the contract can be seen as a process of getting to know and understand
each other. Here, trust can serve as a basis for contract. In an opportunistic
atmosphere, instead, contract negotiations can resemble the battlefield as
sketched by MacNeil (1980), where the most powerful partner dominates
contract content and execution.

Discussion and Notes for Further Research

We have empirically shown that trust and contract need not be ‘opposing
alternatives’ and, more important, shown why this is the case: trust and
contract can well be complements because contracts are in practice often not
used and interpreted in a strictly legal fashion with opportunism as a central
focal point. We claim that future research should no longer focus solely on

the mere presence, absence or completeness of contract. Rather, future
researchers should look at, first, the precise content of clauses included,
second, the intentions with which the contract is drawn up, and third, the
actual use of the contract. In other words, the contract should be placed in its
social context and within the relationship’s development. By interpreting
contracts in this dynamic social as well as legal fashion, the relationship
between trust and contract becomes less simple, yet we also believe that it
brings us closer to reality.
Having looked into the dynamics of relationship development, and
explained the different contents, functions and intentions of contracts in these
relationships, we believe this study has made an important step in resolving
the ‘fundamental disagreement in the literature’ (Lane 1998: 25) concerning
the relationship between trust and control. Both from the viewpoint of TCE
and from a social science perspective it was believed that trust and formal
control were opposing alternatives (Knights et al. 2001). Yet, empirical results
from various studies (Anderson and Narus 1990; Poppo and Zenger 2002;
Zaheer and Venkatraman 1995) did not support this belief and offered no
satisfactory explanation of why empirical results did not support their
hypotheses. The results of our study suggest that these empirical results may
be explained by taking into account that contracts (and possibly other forms
of formal control) may have other than strictly legal and safeguarding
functions.
While our study renders new insights, it also has limitations. The limited
number of cases raises questions on the generalizability and external validity
of the study. We acknowledge these problems and therefore view our study
as exploratory. Large-scale follow-up studies should test whether our results
hold for other types of inter-organizational relationships and for other sectors.
In these studies, not only the relationship between trust and contract should
be investigated, but also the relationship between these concepts and
relationship outcome, in order to test the competing hypotheses from social
sciences and TCE as to whether trust or contract has a stronger impact on
efficient outcomes.
Our study is also limited by the fact that all the cases studied are from one
country. As noted before, this may have influenced the behaviour of the
companies and thus our results. Future research might investigate whether
the results of our study hold in other countries, where companies are more
inclined to bring problems to court (such as the US). Finally, we restricted
our inquiry to contracts. It would be interesting to study the relationship
between trust and other forms of formal control as well.
