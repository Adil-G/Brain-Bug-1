Introduction

Links between R&D in U.S. industry and research in
U.S. universities have a long history, but recent developments in this relationship, especially the growth
in university patenting and licensing of technologies
to private ﬁrms, have attracted considerable attention. U.S. university patenting and licensing have
grown signiﬁcantly in the wake of the Bayh-Dole
Act of 1980. The Act’s effects on U.S. research universities have been the focus of several empirical
studies (Henderson et al. 1998, Trajtenberg et al.
1997, Mowery et al. 2001, Mowery and Ziedonis
2002), which reach slightly different conclusions. The
work of Henderson and colleagues ﬁnds a decline
in the “importance” and “generality” of overall U.S.
academic patenting during the 1980s. Importantly,
this decline is observed for the patents of the institutions that accounted for the majority of academic
patenting before and after 1980, as well as the patents
of institutions with little or no history of patenting before 1980. Henderson et al. (1998) suggest
that their results could reﬂect either a change in
the internal research culture of U.S. universities that
has caused scientists and engineers to pursue more
applied research that yields less signiﬁcant patents, or
the effects of entry into patenting after 1980 by institutions with little experience and expertise in patenting.
In contrast, Mowery and Ziedonis (2002) ﬁnd
that the patents of two universities with substantial

pre-1980 patenting experience display no decline in
importance and generality after 1980. Based on their
analysis of a larger sample of patents issued to experienced and inexperienced academic patenters before
and after 1980, Mowery and Ziedonis conclude that
any changes in the characteristics of U.S. university
patents after 1980 are due in large part to entry, rather
than to changes in university culture.
The Mowery-Ziedonis ﬁndings leave open the possibility that the characteristics of patents issued to
less experienced academic patenters after 1980 might
improve during the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s
as these institutions gain experience in patenting the
inventions of their faculty. This paper examines “university learning” in greater detail, seeking to understand whether and why the importance (based on
citations to these patents) of the post-1980 patents
issuing to less experienced academic patenters has
improved during the 1980s and 1990s. We ﬁrst
analyze trends during the 1980s and 1990s in the
characteristics of the patents issuing to experienced
“incumbent” academic patenters (universities with
at least six patents issued during 1975–1980) and
“entrants” (institutions that obtained fewer than six
patents during the same period). We then test for
the inﬂuence of several potential sources of learning for entrants, including cumulative patenting, links
with the Research Corporation (an organization established in 1912 that during the 1940–1980 period was
an important manager of the patenting and licensing activities of nearly 200 U.S. universities), and the

establishment by entrants of university technology
transfer ofﬁces.
Our results indicate that the importance of entrant
institutions’ patents improved during the 1980s and
1990s, closing the gap with incumbents during a
period in which the average importance of overall
academic patents improved relative to nonacademic
patents. We ﬁnd little evidence of strong “learning
curve” effects, as neither cumulative patenting nor the
(relatively) early establishment of a technology transfer ofﬁce explain these improvements. Links with the
Research Corporation during the “pre-Bayh-Dole” era
also exercise little inﬂuence over changes during the
1980s and 1990s in these characteristics of incumbent
or entrant institutions’ patents. Inasmuch as these
observable sources of learning exercise little inﬂuence,
we conclude that a broader process of learning based
on spillovers among universities may account for the
convergence in importance between the patents of
incumbent and entrant universities.

Data and Methodology

Our analysis uses a data set drawn from all university patents applied for between 1981 and 1992 that
were issued before 1994. The population of university
assignees is composed of the union of all assignees
designated as “universities” in the Case Western
NBER U.S. Patents database and all institutions designated as “research” or “doctorate-granting” universities in the Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education’s 1973 and 1993 reports. These universities received a total of 11,791 patents. The Carnegie
institutions accounted for 10,881 of these patents.
Independent medical schools and technical institutes,
small colleges and universities, and patent management agencies that specialized in the administration
of academic patents received the remaining patents.
We restrict our attention to the patents assigned
to the Carnegie research or doctorate-granting universities. These institutions account for over 90% of
the self-administered patent applications in the sample (rather than applications administered by specialized patent management organizations), allowing us
to compare our results with previous analyses.

2.1. Data
We utilized publicly available information contained
on the front page of each U.S. patent to generate our control sample and to construct our dependent variables. This information includes the patent
number, date of application, date of issue, name of
the assignee, citations of prior art, and the USPTOassigned technology class for the patent.
Our empirical analysis uses citations to university
patents to examine changes in the “importance” of
university patents issued during different subperiods of the 1980s and 1990s. Speciﬁcally, following a number of previous studies (Trajtenberg 1990;
Henderson et al. 1994, 1998; Trajtenberg et al. 1997;
Mowery and Ziedonis 2002), we use the number of
times a patent is cited as “prior art” in subsequent
patents as a proxy for the importance of that patent.
When the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce grants
a patent, the patent examiner includes a list of all
previous patents that were material to the claims in
the issued patent. This list is made public as part of
the publication of the patent at the time it issues. The
patent ofﬁcer is aided in compiling a list of previous
patents by the patent applicant, who is legally bound
to provide with the application a list of all material
“prior art” of which he or she is aware. Patents that
are more heavily cited are widely interpreted to be
more important in terms of their relevance to subsequent inventive activity.
Why might universities with greater experience in
patenting and licensing tend to receive patents that
are more heavily cited? Conversations with licensing ofﬁcers at several research universities and other
ﬁeld research suggested the possibility that inexperienced institutions initially adopted an indiscriminate policy toward patenting as they entered into this
activity after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. In this
view, universities patented faculty inventions with little evaluation of the market for licenses for these
inventions within industry. As these entrant institutions encountered rising costs and stagnant licensing
revenues, many of them became more selective in
their patenting activities. Other research showing a
correlation between licensing revenues and citations
for licensed university patents (Sampat and Ziedonis
2000, and the work cited therein discuss the links
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 2----->MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent

between citations and other measures of the private
economic value of patents), suggests that patents that
are more heavily cited are more likely to yield positive licensing revenues. Accordingly, our analysis
below tests the possibility that entrant universities
were motivated by the prospect of higher licensing
revenues to become more selective in their patenting
activities, obtaining more important patents and effectively “learning to patent.”
Several issues complicate the use of citation counts
as measures of patent importance. First, we observe
only a fraction of a patent’s lifetime citations. More
recently issued patents will have less time to be cited
than patents issued earlier, resulting in a “right truncation bias” for citations. To eliminate this bias, we
restricted our analysis to patents applied for during
the 1981–1992 period and granted before 1994, and
considered only those citations made in applications
appearing during the ﬁve years following the cited
patent’s issue year.1
A second complication is “self-citation” (i.e.,
citation by an assignee of its previous patents). Selfcitations may be a less accurate indicator of the importance of a patent than citations by others, and the
propensity for self-citation may vary across assignees.
Accordingly, we excluded such “self-citations” from
our analysis.
Third, it is important to control for overall trends in
the number of citations for U.S. patents issued during
the 1980s and 1990s. For example, if citations to university patents increase over time as part of a broader
trend of growth in the average number of citations
received by all U.S. patents (e.g., as a result of greater
use of computer-based patent searches), comparisons
of the number of citations to university patents from
different years could overstate any improvements
in the importance of more recent patents. Another
possible source of spurious inferences is differences
in patent-citation propensities among technological
1
Lanjouw and Schankerman (1998) suggest that limiting the time
period subsequent to a patent’s issuance to ﬁve years is sufﬁcient
to construct meaningful measures of a patent’s “importance” based
on “forward” citations. Our data on “forward” citations extend
through the end of 1999. Limiting the university patents in our
sample to those issued prior to 1994 therefore enables us to identify
all citations to each patent within a ﬁve-year “window.”

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

ﬁelds. If such differences in citation propensities are
signiﬁcant, comparisons of the characteristics of the
patent portfolios held by different institutions may
reﬂect variations in the technological composition of
these patent portfolios, rather than differences in the
importance or other characteristics of patents held by
these institutions.
We addressed these time and technology-class
effects by constructing a control group of patents
that included one nonacademic patent for each patent
in our academic patent database. Each nonacademic
control patent was chosen so as to match as closely as
possible the corresponding academic patent’s USPTO
technology class (at the three-digit level) and its date
of application. For 307 of the university patents, the
matching algorithm yielded the same control patent.
We thus have 10,574 different control patents matched
with our 10,881 university patents.
This paper seeks to compare the importance of
patents assigned to “incumbent” academic patenters with those assigned to “entrants.” We deﬁne as
incumbents those U.S. universities that were issued at
least six patents between 1975 and 1980. Conversely,
entrant universities are institutions that were assigned
ﬁve or fewer patents during this time. We constructed
two citation-based measures of the importance of the
patents in our academic and control samples: the
number of citations to the patent within the ﬁve years
following its issue; and whether the patent is cited at
all within the ﬁve-year window.
Several studies (e.g., Mowery et al. 2001) have
pointed to the signiﬁcant role of biomedical inventions in U.S. universities’ patenting and licensing
activities before and after 1980. Accordingly, in addition to including patent class dummy variables in
each of our regressions, we also look separately at the
characteristics of patents within the biomedical and
nonbiomedical ﬁelds, using the taxonomy reported in
Jaffe et al. (1998).
We also consider a number of factors that may have
contributed to entrant university learning. During
the pre-Bayh-Dole era, a number of post-Bayh-Dole
entrants were clients of the Research Corporation,
a leading independent manager of academic patents
and licensing agreements (Mowery and Sampat 2001).
These universities submitted invention disclosures to
75

<-----Page 3----->MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent

the Research Corporation, which in turn managed the
prosecution and licensing of any resulting patents. In
the 1960s, the Research Corporation began to train
clients to identify inventions that were the best candidates for patenting and licensing. We test the hypothesis that “active” clients of the Research Corporation
in the 1970s (i.e., those that submitted ﬁve or more
disclosures to the Research Corporation in any one
year during that decade) received more important
patents than other entrants during the ﬁrst six years
after the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act.
Another potential source of improvements in the
importance of entrants’ patents in the post-BayhDole period is learning from cumulative experience
in patenting. If this hypothesis is true, entrants with
greater experience in patenting during 1981–1986
should have more important patents, on average,
issuing after 1986 than entrant institutions with less
patenting experience during the 1981–1986 period. To
test this hypothesis, we analyzed differences in patent
importance between entrants receiving more than the
median number of entrant-university patents during
the 1981–1986 period and other entrants.
Finally, the establishment of a formal “Technology
Licensing Ofﬁce” (TLO) and the hiring of licensing
professionals may have contributed to improvements
in the importance of entrant universities’ patents after
1980. We test the hypothesis that entrants that established TLOs more quickly following passage of the
Bayh-Dole Act acquired “higher-importance” patents,
on average, than entrants that were slower to establish formal TLOs. We compare the importance of
patents assigned to entrants who reported that at
least one-half “full-time equivalent” employee (0.5
FTE) was employed in technology transfer activities
prior to 1986 with the importance of patents assigned
to entrant universities that had not established such
technology transfer ofﬁces by that date.

where Appt is a dummy variable that equals 1 for all

We also conducted Poisson regressions, but tested for and found
evidence of overdispersion, suggesting that the negative binomial
model is more appropriate.

We also conducted but do not report the results of regression
speciﬁcations using interaction terms for individual application
years. These regressions produced results similar to those from
regressions where application years were aggregated into threeyear intervals. The ﬁrst application year dummy and ﬁrst patent

The ratio of Equations (3) and (2) is the “proportional difference” between the number of citations to
academic patents and the number of citations to the
control patents in year T , or exp	T . We test for differences between the number of citations to university and control group patents in year t by testing if
	T = 0. Such a test indicates whether academic patents
applied for in year T received signiﬁcantly more citations than the corresponding sample of nonacademic
control patents applied for in that year.
To compare the importance of entrant universities’
patents with those issued to incumbent universities
and with our nonacademic control patents, we insert
a dummy variable, ENT, that identiﬁes entrant universities in (1), making the conditional mean function:

Dividing Equation (5) by Equation (6) yields the
proportional difference in the number of citations

applied for by incumbents in year t = T , or expt .
Similarly, the ratio of Equations (6) and (7) is the
proportional difference in citations between incumbent and control patents exp	t , and the ratio of
Equations (5) and (7) is the proportional difference
in citations between entrants and control patents, or
exp	t + t . Testing for the signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst
two differences expt  and exp	t  requires a standard z-test. We use a Wald test of the linear restriction
	t + t = 0 to analyze the difference in citation rates
between entrant and control sample patents.
Finally, to assess whether our various “learning
mechanisms” inﬂuence the characteristics of patents
issued to entrant universities, we identify three characteristics of entrant universities: (a) the existence of
a contractual relationship with the Research Corporation, (b) above-median levels of cumulative 1980–1986
patenting, and (c) the assignment of at least 0.5
FTE to formal technology transfer activities during
1980–1986. We compare the number of citations to the
patents of entrant universities with each of these characteristics with those of patents assigned to entrants
lacking each of these three characteristics. We deﬁne
a variable EXPENT that equals one only for experienced entrants, yielding the following conditional
mean function:

The proportional difference in the number of citations

We also use this basic framework to analyze our

Tables 1 and 2 report results of negative binomial
and probit regression4 for the full sample of university and control group patents. Tables 3 and 4 report
similar results for biomedical patents only, and Tables
5 and 6 report results for nonbiomedical patents. In
each table, Model 1 represents the base speciﬁcation,
which includes the UNIV, Appt , and Classc variables.
Model 2 adds the ENT dummy variable, and Models
3–5 separately add each of the EXPENT dummy variables. For expositional clarity, we do not report coefﬁcients for Appt , and Classc . Tables 7 and 8 report
results from Wald tests of the restriction 	t + t = 0
in Model 2 (i.e., tests of entrant patent importance
relative to the control group patent importance).

Discussion of Results

We begin our discussion by comparing the importance of patents assigned to universities with the
importance of the patents in our nonacademic control
sample for patents with application years between
1981 and 1992. Following this analysis, we compare
the importance of patents assigned to incumbent
and entrant universities during the early “post-BayhDole” period (1981–1986), and separately examine
biomedical and nonbiomedical patents from these
universities during this period. Finally, we analyze
changes in the importance of patents issued to entrant
universities during the 1980s and consider possible sources of learning that could explain observed
improvements.
3.1.

Are Academic Patents Issued After 1980
Less “Important”?
As we noted earlier, Mowery and Ziedonis (2002) analyzed a related dataset on U.S. academic patents and
failed to ﬁnd a decline in the importance of the “postBayh-Dole” patents of U.S. universities with signiﬁcant experience in patenting prior to 1980 (in contrast
to the results obtained by Henderson et al. (1998)).
The ﬁndings reported below are consistent with the

collinearity, resulting in a sample size of 21,316.

Mowery-Ziedonis (2002) results and highlight the role
of entry in affecting overall trends in the importance
of academic patents after 1980.
The coefﬁcients reported in Model 1 of the Tables
1 and 2 indicate that the importance of U.S. university patents did not decline, relative to that
of nonacademic patents, for patents applied for
during the 1981–1992 period. In Table 1, the “importance differential” coefﬁcient 	t  remains positive
and highly statistically signiﬁcant throughout the
1981–1992 period for the overall university sample.
University patents received a signiﬁcantly higher
number of citations than the corresponding control
group patents throughout the ﬁrst decade following
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. Model 1 of Table 2 indicates that university patents were also signiﬁcantly
more likely to receive at least one citation within ﬁve
years of issue than were patents in the nonacademic
control patent sample (	t coefﬁcients remain positive
and signiﬁcant for Models 2–6 in Tables 1 and 2).
What might explain the disagreement between our
results and those of Henderson et al. (1998)? First,
Henderson and colleagues look at all citations to
university and control patents, but we include only
citations that occur within ﬁve years of the issue dates
of the patents. Most empirical work on patent citations, however, indicates that citations peak during
the ﬁrst four years after the issue date of the cited
patent, so the effects of this difference in the construction of the citation measures used in these two
studies should be modest. Second, our empirical analysis also uses a control sample that differs somewhat
from that employed by Henderson et al. Henderson
and colleagues generated a l/100 sample of all U.S.
patents as a control sample, but our control sample
is composed solely of nonacademic patents that are
matched to the university patents by application date
and patent class. Third, Henderson and colleagues
had access to only eight years of post-Bayh-Dole
patents (those applied for by 1988) and citations that
extended only through 1992. But we use 12 years of
post-Bayh-Dole patents (those applied for by 1992)
and citations to these patents that extend through
1999. Some of the speciﬁcations reported below do
show a slight decline in the importance of patents
issued to experienced university patenters during the

the results in Henderson et al. (1998); however we
ﬁnd that the importance of these universities’ patents,
improves by the 1990–1992 period. None of these differences between our data and measures and those of
Henderson et al. should affect our inferences concerning changes in the relative importance of entrants’
and incumbents’ patents during the 1980s and 1990s,

Do Post-1980 Entrants Have Less Important
Patents than Incumbents During the First
Six Years After Bayh-Dole?
As we noted in §2, we can assess incumbententrant differentials in patent importance by examining the t coefﬁcients reported in Model 2 of
Tables 1 and 2. In this section, we compare the
importance of incumbent-university patents with that
of entrant-university patents for patents applied for

during 1981–1986. The negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcients in Table 1 for 1981–1983 and 1984–1986 suggest that the importance of patents assigned to entrant
universities was indeed lower than the importance of
the patents assigned to incumbent universities in the
early 1980s (8183 = −0190 and 8183 = −0218). These

The fact that incumbents enjoy a greater importance advantage for nonbiomedical technologies than
biomedical technologies during the six years after
Bayh-Dole may indicate that patenting experience is
less important for patent importance in biomedical
ﬁelds. This hypothesis receives modest support in
Mowery and Sampat (2001), who ﬁnd that Research
Corporation client institutions (all of whom had little
84

experience in patenting) were more successful at
“cherry-picking” biomedical patents than nonbiomedical patents. These results also are consistent with
the comparisons in Mowery and Ziedonis (2002)
of citations to nonacademic biomedical and nonbiomedical patents with citations to UC and Stanford
biomedical and nonbiomedical patents before and
after Bayh-Dole.

3.3.

Does the Importance of Entrant-University
Patents Improve During the 1980s and
early 1990s?
Our analysis thus far suggests that post-Bayh-Dole
entrants into academic patenting received slightly
less important patents, on average, during the 1981–
1986 period than did more experienced incumbents.
If institutional experience in patenting is responsible
for the differences in importance between the patents
of post-1980 entrant universities and pre-1980 incumbents, then the patenting activities of entrant universities could result in institutional learning that narrows
the differentials highlighted in the previous section.
Learning by entrants could also result in improvement in the importance of entrants’ patents relative
to the control patents. Accordingly, in this section, we
test for changes during the 1980s and early 1990s in
the “importance differential” between entrants’ and
incumbents’ patents (	t = 0) and between entrant and
control group patents (	t + t = 0).
Within our overall sample (Tables 1 and 2), entrant
patent importance was signiﬁcantly lower than that
of incumbents for patents applied for during 1981–
1986 (Model 2), but these differentials are statistically
insigniﬁcant for patents applied for during 1987–1992.
Nonbiomedical patents, where the incumbent-entrant
importance differential was most pronounced during the 1981–1986 period, display similar changes in
importance (Model 2 of Tables 5 and 6). These ﬁndings suggest that in nonbiomedical ﬁelds, where the
initial post-Bayh-Dole patent importance differences
were most signiﬁcant, the importance of entrants’ and
incumbents’ patents is converging for patents applied
for during the 1987–1992 period.
We also examined changes in the importance differentials between entrant university patents and control group patents and report these results in Tables 7
and 8. The results in Table 7 suggest that entrantuniversity patents were not signiﬁcantly more highly
cited than control-group patents during the early
post-Bayh-Dole period (Wald test statistics are not
signiﬁcant for the patents applied for in either the
1981–1983 or 1984–1986 periods). Moreover, Wald
statistics also are not signiﬁcant in separate tests
for differences in importance between entrants’ and
incumbents’ biomedical patents and for these groups’

Learning to Patent

Overall, these data suggest that the “importance” of
incumbent-university and entrant-university patents
applied for during the later 1980s and early 1990s
converged to a considerable extent. Moreover, this
convergence reﬂects improvement in the importance
of entrants’ patents, rather than decreases in the
importance of incumbents’ patents.6 The convergence
is most marked for nonbiomedical technologies,
where the differences between the importance of
incumbents’ and entrants’ patents applied for during
1981–1986 were greatest. In most of the speciﬁcations,
the importance of entrants’ patents also improves
relative to that of the nonacademic controls in the
later cohorts of patents (those applied for after 1986).
Taken together, these results suggest that entrant universities do indeed seem to have learned to patent
during the 1980s. We consider some possible sources
of such learning in the following section.
3.4. Sources of Entrant Learning
We tested for three sources of entrant learning: (1)
entrant universities’ relationships with the Research
Corporation prior to Bayh-Dole, (2) “learning by
doing” in patenting during the early post-Bayh-Dole
period, and (3) the effects on patent importance of
the creation by entrant universities of formally designated ofﬁces for patent management and licensing. In
this analysis we examine the possibility that “experienced” entrants (deﬁned using each of these indicators of experience) received more important patents
than other entrants. As noted earlier, the coefﬁcient

Improvement in entrant patent importance could reﬂect changes
in funding patterns. For example, if an institution’s patent
importance is related to the size of its research base, the importance of entrant universities’ patents could improve as research
funding increases even in the absence of “learning.” Geiger and
Feller (1995) found evidence of increased interinstitutional dispersion in federal funding of university research during the 1980s.
If increased interinstitutional dispersion disproportionately beneﬁted the universities that we classify as entrances, then our results
may reﬂect the infusions of federal research funding received by
these institutions, rather than improved patent management. But
since Geiger and Feller found that funding disparity was greatest in biomedicine, a ﬁeld in which we ﬁnd little evidence of
improvement in the importance of entrants’ patents, this “dispersion hypothesis” seems wanting.

86

for EXPENT t  measures the difference in importance between patents issued to experienced entrants
and to those issued to less experienced entrants in
year t.
Model 3 in Tables 1–6 report the EXPENT variables’ coefﬁcients for entrants who were active clients
of Research Corporation before 1980 and for other
entrants in each period from 1981–1983 to 1990–
1992. The existence of a contractual relationship with
the Research Corporation does not appear to be an
important source of improvement in the importance
of entrants’ patents during the 1980s. The EXPENT
coefﬁcients in Column 3 for the overall sample are
not signiﬁcant in any period (Tables 1 and 2) with
the exception of 1984–1986, where the coefﬁcient is
negative and signiﬁcant, indicating that in those years
entrants who were active clients of Research Corporation before Bayh-Dole received patents that were less
important, on average, than those of other entrants.
Similarly, in the biomedical and nonbiomedical subsamples, there is no evidence that entrants who were
active clients have more important patents than other
entrants after Bayh-Dole, and some evidence that they
have less important patents.
The reasons for the Research Corporation’s lack
of inﬂuence on improvement in client ﬁrms’ patents
after 1980 are unclear and merit further investigation.
One reason could be the lack of incentives for selectivity by client universities in the submission of inventions to the Research Corporation for patenting and
licensing. Research Corporation client universities
bore no costs under “Invention Administration Agreements” with the Corporation (See Mowery and
Sampat 2001), and therefore may have lacked the
motivation to learn skills in recognizing and selecting commercially promising inventions during the
1960s and 1970s. It is also possible that “outsourcing”
patent management activities to the Research Corporation prevented client universities from acquiring
these skills.
A second source of learning is cumulative patenting (“learning by doing”). We tested the effects
of entrants’ patenting experience during the 1981–
1986 period on changes in the importance of
entrants’ patents applied for after 1986 to determine
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 14----->MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent

whether entrants with more extensive patenting experience during these years received more important
patents, on average, after 1986 than less experienced
entrants.7 In Models 4 of Tables 1–6, EXPENT is set
equal to 1 for all entrants with an above-median
number of patents (within the entrant population)
applied for during the 1981–1986 period. EXPENT
in Model 4 measures differences between the importance of patents applied for after 1986 by entrants
that received an “above-median” number of patents
during 1981–1986 and the importance of patents
applied for during these years by entrants with a
“below-median” number of patents for 1981–1986.
Surprisingly, the post-1986 patents issued to entrants
with greater patenting experience in the 1981–1986
period tend to receive fewer citations, on average,
than other entrants’ patents.
For the full sample, patents issued to more experienced entrants during 1987–1989 and 1990–1992
received signiﬁcantly fewer citations than the patents
issued to less experienced entrants during these
periods (Model 4 of Table 1), and we obtain similar
results for the number of “zero-citation” patents for
the 1987–1989 period (Model 4 of Table 2). Similarly,
within the biomedical and nonbiomedical subsamples, there is no evidence that entrants with higher
levels of pre-1987 patenting had more important
patents after 1987, as the “learning curve” hypothesis would imply. These ﬁndings suggest that cumulative experience in patenting does not account for
the improvements in importance of entrants’ patents
observed after the mid-1980s.
Finally, we examined the effects on the importance
of entrants’ patents of the establishment after 1980 of
formal “Technology Licensing Ofﬁces” (TLOs). Using
AUTM (1994) data, we coded EXPENT = 1 for universities that established a formal TLO (i.e., reported
allocating at least 0.5 FTE to the management of technology transfer, patenting, and licensing activities) by
1986. The results of our analysis of the effects of establishing a TLO during 1981–1986 on the importance

In separate regressions (not reported), we analyze the average
importance of an institution’s patents at time t as a function of
cumulative patenting experience for the entire 1975–1992 period.
These regressions did not reveal a relationship between cumulative
patenting and patent importance.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

of entrants’ post-1986 patents are reported in Model
5 in Tables 1–6. Tables 1 and 2 suggest that for the
overall sample of patents, early establishment of a
TLO did not improve patent importance relative to
entrants that did not establish TLOs prior to 1987. The
EXPENT 8789 coefﬁcient is negative and signiﬁcant in
both Table 1 and 2, and the coefﬁcient for EXPENT 9092
is not signiﬁcant. For biomedical technologies, the
coefﬁcient for EXPENT 8789 is not signiﬁcant in Tables
3 and 4, and the EXPENT 9092 coefﬁcient is signiﬁcant (and positive) only in Table 4. For nonbiomedical
technologies, the EXPENT 8789 coefﬁcient is negative
and signiﬁcant and the coefﬁcient for EXPENT 9092 is
not signiﬁcant in either Tables 5 or 6.
These results suggest that early establishment of a
TLO after Bayh-Dole was not correlated with receiving more important patents during the 1987–1992
period. Indeed, the establishment of a TLO during
1980–1986 actually is associated with less important
patents during the 1987–1989 period. Although not
deﬁnitive, these ﬁndings are consistent with anecdotal evidence that some universities initially assigned
persons with little knowledge or skill in patent and
licensing management when they established formal
TLOs, and that simply bestowing the title of “Technology Licensing Ofﬁcer” was not sufﬁcient to successfully generate more important patents. Instead, the
establishment of a formal ofﬁce of technology licensing may have been an outcome, rather than a cause,
of “learning to patent.”
Although we are not able to test for their effects,
other mechanisms of organizational learning may
have enabled entrants to improve the importance of
their patents. Organizations can learn from the experiences of others directly (e.g., consulting, personnel
transfer, and conferences) and indirectly (e.g., monitoring of others and informal discussions with colleagues). Both of these channels appear to have been
important means for entrant universities to learn to
manage patenting and licensing. For example, Neils
Reimers, founder of Stanford’s Ofﬁce of Technology
Licensing in 1969, served as a consultant to a number
of entrant and incumbent universities’ technology
licensing ofﬁces during the 1980s, and disseminated
information on procedures that were successful at
Stanford to other institutions.
87

<-----Page 15----->MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent

Anecdotal evidence of personnel transfer among
universities suggests another channel for interinstitutional knowledge diffusion and learning. In the late
1980s, for example, Columbia University, a post-1980
entrant, recruited the former director of the technology transfer program at Iowa State University, an
institution with a long history of patenting. The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM),
founded in the mid-1970s also appears to have disseminated information on “best practice” through its
conferences and professional meetings of university
technology transfer personnel.
Entrant universities also almost certainly learned
from informal communication and interaction within
the broader community of technology licensing ofﬁcials during the 1980s. For example, Columbia University shifted to a more selective policy toward
patenting faculty inventions after 1981, patenting an
invention only when a probable licensee could be
located (Crow 2000). Columbia’s adoption of this
and other policies resulted from informal discussions
with directors of other university technology licensing
ofﬁces. Similar informal communications and interactions may have contributed to improvements in
entrants’ patent importance during the 1980s and
early 1990s.
Indeed, from the earliest days of university involvement of patenting and licensing, universities drew
upon and learned from the experiences of others in
selecting the inventions they sought to patent and
in the overall management of patenting and licensing activities (Mowery and Sampat 2001, Sampat and
Nelson 2002). This trend appears to have continued
after Bayh-Dole. Feldman et al. (2002) suggest that
universities have learned from one another in using
equity investments as part of their technology transfer
strategies. Seen against these historical and contemporary accounts, it would be surprising if universities
did not “learn to patent” via informal channels and
other mechanisms.

Conclusion

University–industry interaction in research has long
been an unusual hallmark of the U.S. national innovation system. Although U.S. universities had for
88

much of the 20th century been active patenters and
licensers, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 simpliﬁed the
administration of this process (especially for inventions resulting from federally funded research), and
elevated the importance and visibility of these activities. Bayh-Dole also contributed to the entry into these
activities by a large number of institutions with little
historical experience in patenting and licensing.
This paper has examined the changing characteristics of the patents assigned to entrant and incumbent university patenters during the post-Bayh-Dole
period in an effort to determine the existence and
scope of improvements in the importance of entrant
universities’ patents. Consistent with the results of
related work (Mowery and Ziedonis 2002), we ﬁnd little evidence of a decline in the importance of patents
issuing after 1980 that are assigned to experienced
patenters. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the importance of
entrant institutions’ patents improved during the later
1980s and 1990s.
Our results provide little evidence to support an
argument that change in U.S. universities’ internal
“research culture” after Bayh-Dole triggered a decline
in the importance of academic patents, at least for the
ﬁrst 14 years following the passage of the act. This
ﬁnding does not rule out the possibility, however, that
such changes in the academic research culture may be
occurring gradually and could eventually be revealed
in declines in these measures of academic patents’
importance.
Although our analysis seems to suggest that universities can indeed learn to patent, the sources of
such learning are not clear. Cumulative patenting
experience, historical relationships with the nonproﬁt
Research Corporation, and the allocation of administrative talent to formally designated technology transfer activities all fail to explain improvement over time
in the importance of the patents in this group of universities. All of these measures of sources of learning
are ﬂawed, but their lack of signiﬁcance suggests that
a more diffuse learning process may underpin our
results. This speculative conclusion also creates abundant new possibilities for additional research.
