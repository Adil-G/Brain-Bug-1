Abstract This paper examines the impact of culture on inter-firm network development in
international marketing. Three research questions about the influence of culture on network
development were developed from the literature to focus case data collection and analysis. The data
were collected from in-depth interviews with network managers/owners of firms networking with
other overseas firms entering into Australian and Asian markets. Differences and similarities
between how overseas Chinese and Australian cultures impact on network development and
strategies for developing and maintaining quality and long-term relationship in cross-cultural
networks were identified. Implications for practice emphasise the importance of cultural
adaptation.

Introduction
Culture is a distinctive element of international marketing. While factors
besides culture are present, culture could be a key determinant of most
overseas relationships (Tornroos and Moller, 1993). Researchers agree that
exchange processes within business networks can only be understood by
conducting studies in different countries and cultures (Deshpande and
Webster, 1989; Fraxier et al., 1989; Kale and McIntyre, 1991). For example,
studies of joint ventures between China and the USA have suggested that the
national cultures of the participating partners were one of the important
variables that determined their success (Baird et al., 1990; Ding, 1997; Eiteman,
1990; Fischer, 1993; Pan, 1997; Tse et al., 1997; Vanhonacker and Pan, 1997).
Indeed, an understanding of culture in China helps to understand and describe
the whole exchange process with that country (Buttery and Leung, 1998).
Nevertheless, the impact of culture on how international relationships develop
is under-researched, that is, “impact of culture on aspects of
Professor Chad Perry is now retired.

<-----Page 1----->inter-organisational networks and negotiating styles has received little
research attention” (Sekaran and Snodgrass, 1990, p. 92). In brief, the effects
of culture on inter-firm network development are important, but remain
relatively unexplored (Pyatt, 1995).
Thus, the aim of this paper is to explore how culture affects the development
of international marketing networks between people of Chinese origin and of
the relatively Western country of Australia. Essentially, the authors argue that
understanding culture can overcome barriers at the stages of network
development. The paper’s contribution arises from it being the first rigorous
investigation on how culture affects each stage of network development.
This paper has four sections. First, a comparison of cultural dimensions
using Hofstede’s (1980, 1984a, b) framework is made for overseas Chinese and
Australian cultures. Then, a theoretical framework linking dimensions of
culture with inter-firm network development processes is developed from the
literature, with related research questions. Second, the case research
methodology is justified and described. Next, the results of case interviews
for each research question are discussed. Finally, implications for management
are raised and limitations and further research opportunities are noted.
Delimiting the research to overseas Chinese and Australian cultures can be
justified. China has an old Eastern civilisation, has one quarter of the world’s
population and a fast growing economy that may overtake that of the USA
within only a few decades (Leung et al., 1995). In turn, the Overseas Chinese,
that is, people of Chinese ancestry living outside China (Hodder, 1996; Redding,
1995), have a “national” product that has been estimated to be the equivalent of
China’s and foreign reserves that rival Japan’s and the USA’s (Hodder, 1996). In
contrast, Australia is a young, Western country that is reasonably wealthy but
has such a small population that it must trade with faster-growing countries in
Asia. The two cultures therefore offer an interesting contrast.
Theoretical foundations
Culture is complex and therefore difficult to define. Comprehensively, Hofstede
(1983, 1994a) defines culture as mental programming from past experiences –
“the collective programming of mind which distinguishes the members of one
of one group or society or category or nation from another”. His research
focussed on national or ecological-level culture. Other researchers have
extended our understanding of culture. For example, Trompenaars and
Hampden-Turner (1998, p. 6) do not make the assumption that people can be
programmed in a way that individuals cannot alter and define culture as “the
way in which a group of people solve problems and reconcile dilemmas”.
Similarly, Schneider and Barsoux (1997) emphasise an interpretive approach to
culture that recognises many levels of culture ranging from artifacts and
behaviour down to unrecognised assumptions. Thus, the notion that culture is
programmed is moving to an awareness that national or ecological levels of

culture do not necessarily have parallels with group and individual culture
(Hofstede and Bond, 1988; Schneider, 1989).
Some of these limitations of Hofstede’s work are addressed in the research
questions and interview findings described later, but this research chose to use
Hofstede’s dimensions of national culture and their measures as starting points
for developing research questions about how networks of several individuals
from different national cultures can act in work-related, network management
situations. These dimensions and measures are still widely used – “Hofstede’s
work has inspired a great improvement in the discipline of specifying a
wide-ranging model which serve to coordinate research efforts” (Redding, 1992,
p. 220). Indeed, international and cross-cultural studies have heavily cited and
replicated Hofstede’s dimensions – they are the “most important and popular
theories of culture types” (Sondergaard, 1994, p. 450). This research fits into this
tradition. More particularly, this research applied all five of Hofstede’s
dimensions of culture for three reasons. First, Hofstede provides five dimensions
of culture when some other researchers have only one or two dimensions (for
example, Gesteland, 1999; Hall, 1976). Second, they have been widely used for
understanding work-related cultures (for example, Perry, 1991, 1992), their
validity and reliability have been confirmed (Hoppe, 1990) and they appear to
offer potential in terms of a generalisable quantifiable framework with which to
study the impact of culture (Clark, 1990). Finally, this present research is dealing
with two cultures, and Hofstede’s five cultural dimensions are an attempt to
consider these two types of culture (Hofstede, 1980, 1991) – Western culture
represented by Australians and Chinese culture represented by the overseas
Chinese community. In brief, using Hofstede’s measures has some limitations for
this research, but it is a useful first step for understanding overseas
Chinese-Australian network development – Hofstede provides a “useful
framework for cross-cultural research” (Holzmuller and Stollnberger, 1994, p. 17).
Hofstede offers five dimensions of culture – individualism/collectivism, power
distance, masculinity/femininity, uncertainty avoidance and long-term/short-term
orientation, which is also known as Confucian dynamism. Consider each of these
for South East Asian countries with predominantly Chinese populations like
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore – where most of the overseas Chinese
interviewees in this study come from – and for the Western countries like the
USA, Australia and Canada. Table I summarises the scores of these countries’
cultural dimensions into a range that could apply to Australians and to overseas
Chinese. In the following section based on Table I, Hofstede’s dimensions of
culture are discussed for these two cultures.
Consider Australia in Table I. It appears to be highly individualistic, and has
low power distance and a short-term orientation. On these three dimensions, it
is very different from China, but it is more similar to China in the other two
dimensions, with medium uncertainty avoidance compared with China’s
low/medium level, and low medium masculinity compared to China’s medium

level. Australia has become a more multicultural society than it was when
Hofstede’s research was done, and this poses a difficulty for defining the
national Australian culture. However, given its Anglo-colonial tradition, the
mainstream Australian culture might still be considered to have basic cultural
elements that are Anglo and “Western” as described in Table I with emphasis
on individualism and egalitarianism (Westwood and Posner, 1997). Certainly,
Hofstede (1991) emphasised the durability of national cultures.
Similarly, there are many Chinese sub-cultures within the general acceptable
picture of Chinese culture shown in Table I. However, there are common basic
beliefs among many mainland Chinese and the overseas Chinese diaspora, and
these are quite different from Australia’s. These common beliefs emphasise
collectivism and a family orientation, power distance and Confucian qualities
(Hofstede, 1991; Hofstede and Bond, 1988; Westwood and Posner, 1997). These
basic beliefs may reflect the durable nature of a Chinese culture, as noted earlier
for Australia’s culture.
In brief, the Australian and the overseas Chinese cultures can be viewed as
being different along the five dimensions. Table II provides additional details
of these two different cultures.

inter-firm networks. The few existing buyer-seller relationship development
models differ widely, with the number of stages ranging from three to five
(Dwyer et al., 1987; Ford and Rosson, 1982; Heide, 1994; Kanter, 1994; Larson,
1992; Rosson and Ford, 1982; Wilson, 1995) and most have not been tested in an
international context. Thus, for this research, the authors synthesise previous
research stages models into a five stages model which consists of searching,
starting, development, maintenance, termination processes. This synthesis was
confirmed in preliminary, convergent interviews (Carson et al., 2001) with
several network experts, and in a separate analysis of the interviewees in this
study.
As noted earlier, culture is likely to play a role in these stages of a
cross-national marketing relationship. In this research, the five stages model of
relationship development is combined with Hofstde’s framework to provide a
theoretical foundation for understanding how culture impacts on the
relationship development process in an international context, as shown in
Table III. Detailed discussion of the hypothesised positive or negative impacts
of these cultural dimensions on each stage of inter-firm network development is
presented in the next section.
Relationship searching stage. The relationship searching process stage is
expected to be easier in overseas Chinese communities than in the West
because their high collectivism should make searching for contacts easier;
in addition, the low/medium uncertainty avoidance, medium femininity and
long-term orientation in Chinese societies makes the search relatively easy
through personal contacts or through the introduction of a trusted third
party (Kao, 1991). However, their high power distance and low/medium
uncertainty avoidance make it difficult to search outside their hierarchical
level (Lasserre and Schutte, 1995) compared to the West. This picture is
shown in the three positives and two negatives in Table III. Overall, their
contacts should help in this relationship searching stage, for “dealing with

<-----Page 7----->overseas Chinese boils down to a matter of contacts” (Geng-ping, 1995,
p. 24). The Chinese system of business is through guanxi and interacting
within guanxi traditionally involves Chinese process-orientated behaviour
as distinct from action-orientated behaviour commonly accepted by the
Western firms (Pyatt, 1995). Gesteland (1999) calls the difference a
relationship-versus a deal-focus.
In contrast, the first stage of relationship development among firms in the
West is expected to be based on searching for competitive advantage because
their different cultural values of low collectivism, low/medium femininity and
short-term orientation tend to not encourage co-operation between competitive
firms.
Relationship starting stage. The collectivism, high power distance and medium
femininity of the Chinese would hinder the starting relationship stage with
strangers, whereas their low/medium uncertainty avoidance and long-term
orientation would facilitate it (as shown by two positives and three negatives in
the second row in Table III). This expectation can be justified. This relationship
starting process stage would be relatively difficult in overseas Chinese societies,
especially in the initial encounters with new members who are outside family
and kinship circles. It is therefore not surprising that from the Oriental point of
view “the most important stage of relationship building occurs right at the start”
(Wincott, 1992, p. 405). This stage of establishing rapport and interdependence
between the parties provides an environment of relationship/trust and time has
to be invested in building that environment (Redding, 1995).
In contrast, in a high individualism culture such as Australia, one can expect
parties in a network to be inclined to position themselves in the relationship
starting stage within an individualistic framework that fosters an “I”
orientation and emotional independence.
Relationship development stage. The collectivism, medium femininity and
long-term orientation of Chinese culture would be expected to facilitate the
relationship development stage, whereas their high power distance and
low/medium uncertainty avoidance would hinder it (as shown by three
positives and two negatives in the third row in Table III). This expectation can
also be justified. The relationship development process stage would be
relatively easy in the overseas Chinese societies because collectivism and
long-term orientation should compensate for high power distance, at least in
networks among power equals. The motivation to develop the relationship
would be both economically and socially oriented, and a long time orientation
would help overseas Chinese to establish a strong network linkage (Hofstede,
1980; Sekaran and Snodgrass, 1990). Thus, human interaction and personal
levels of friendship are crucial issues at this stage.
In contrast, the development stage presents more difficulties in the West
because individualism and short-term orientation point towards profit/money
with less emphasis on social dimensions (Sekaran and Snodgrass, 1990).

Relationship maintenance stage. The collectivism, medium femininity and
long-term orientation of the Chinese culture would be expected to facilitate the
relationship maintenance stage, whereas their high power distance and
low/medium uncertainty avoidance would hinder it (as shown by the three
positives and two negatives in the fourth row in Table III). This expectation
can again be justified. This relationship maintenance process stage would be
relatively easy in Chinese societies because collectivism, medium femininity
and long-term orientation are catalysts for maintaining a business relationship.
Chinese societies take an approach that works in the interest of achieving and
maintaining harmony, saving face and creating balance; they tend to view
business networks as a “whole” so that a business person in these societies
would be uncomfortable when disharmony was initiated (Lim, 1992) and thus
steps are taken to avoid confrontation and preserve any vertical authority
relationship (Ho, 1980). Moreover, the value system of the overseas Chinese
family business confers not just power of bonding, but enhances its flexibility
and capacity to re-align relationships if the original ones cannot be maintained
or depended upon (Redding, 1992, 1995). Indeed, under their guanxi system,
there is a strong sense of mutual obligation in the overseas Chinese culture and
this helps to bind the business dealings together for extended periods (Lasserre,
1997; Luo and Chen, 1997a, b; Wu, 1995).
In contrast, the West with short-term orientation and medium masculinity
would be more inclined to take a fragmented view of the relationship and
would not be discomforted by group disharmony except where the third party
has the responsibility of maintaining harmony or acts as moderator
(Carruthers, 1995; Tornroos and Moller, 1993). Thus, the Western party
would likely insist on some formal means of enforcing compliance among
exchange partners in the network instead of leaving it to be self-monitoring as
in the Chinese networks.
Relationship termination stage. The collectivism, medium femininity and
long-term orientation of the Chinese culture would hinder the relationship
termination stage, whereas their low/medium uncertainty avoidance and high
power distance would be expected to facilitate it (as shown by two positives
and three negatives in the fifth row in Table III). This expectation can also be
justified. This relationship termination process stage would be relatively
difficult in the overseas Chinese society, because their collectivism, medium
femininity and long-term orientation would tend to build long-lived
relationships. Personal and business relationships are considered to be one,
so that personal relationships are almost essential and integral to business
relationships and “are built for life” (Wincott, 1992, p. 406). That is, personal
relationships are the foundation of all other relationships (Banthin and Stelzer,
1989; Redding, 1993), and as a result, overseas Chinese go to great lengths to
maintain a harmonious relationship with in-group members (Triandis, 1989).

<-----Page 9----->Instead of terminating the relationship, they may place it in an inert stage, to be
re-activated later when new opportunities arise (Havila, 1996).
In contrast, termination in the individualistic West can be more easily
implemented with a cost/benefit analysis being the overriding criterion for
continuing the network. Nevertheless, there will be some psychological
bitterness if procedures for terminating relationships have not been contained
in the network documentation.
In brief, one can speculate on the likely impact of cultural dimensions at each
stage in the inter-firm network relationship development process between
overseas Chinese and Australian firms entering Australian and Asian markets.
For this purpose, RQ1 and RQ2 have been developed from Table III. These two
research questions will be the focus of data collection and analysis about
whether business people are aware of their culture and of those of their
networking partners, and whether the cultures of Australian and Chinese
business people influence inter-firm network development:
RQ1. Are overseas Chinese and Australian business people aware of their
cultural dimensions and those of their counterparts?
RQ2. How do Australian and Chinese cultures influence the development of
inter-firm networks through stages of relationship development
process?
RQ3 highlights the need to recognise how partners could develop strategies to
encourage the development and maintenance of cross-cultural, inter-firm
relationships. However, there is scarce empirical evidence about this issue:
RQ3. What strategies can be used to foster the development and
maintenance of long-term Australian and overseas Chinese networks?
Methodology
Culture is complex and so a qualitative methodology with rich data was
required. We wanted to obtain holistic understandings, explanations and
interpretations of a particular situation and its meaning by collecting data from
practitioners’ rich experiences (Gilmore and Carson, 1996). Of the many
qualitative methodologies, case research (Carson et al., 2001; Perry, 1998) was
appropriate for this research because the situations being researched were
contemporary and embedded in contexts where boundaries were uncertain and
required multiple sources of data (Yin, 1994) to describe socially constructed
meanings adequately (Easterby-Smith et al., 1991). In some case research, no
prior theories exist and the research is used to generate theories (Eisenhardt,
1989). However, this case research followed Yin’s recommendation that “theory
development prior to the collection of any case study data is an essential step in
doing case studies” (Yin, 1989, p. 36) and so developed the prior theory outlined
in Table III.

Data were collected about Australian/overseas Chinese international
marketing networks. That is, selecting the cases used the principles of
theoretical and literal replication with networks chosen to provide different
and same results respectively (Yin, 1994), as shown in Table IV. Thus, cases
were chosen to fit into each of the four theoretical replication conditions:
newly established networks in manufacturing and services industries, fully
established networks in manufacturing and services industries; and for each
of these, the author considered networks dominated by Australian partners
and those dominated by overseas Chinese partners, as shown in the first two
rows of Table IV. In addition, some cases were added to satisfy Patton’s
(1990) criterion of maximum variation. That is, some wholly (100 per cent)
overseas Chinese and wholly (100 per cent) Australian networks were
selected, at the extreme ends of the overseas Chinese-Australian continuum,
as shown in the next two rows of Table IV. These 12 case studies are within
the recommended range of between four and 15 cases (Eisenhardt, 1989;
Huberman and Miles, 1994; Perry, 1998) and appeared appropriate because
this number provided maximum variation across the Chinese-Australian
network continuum, and consequently deserved an in-depth study of the core
elements and their common patterns (Patton, 1990, p. 184). In brief, prior
industry knowledge was used to select cases to provide rich insights drawn
from their differences during the cross-cluster and cross-national analysis
described later (Perry, 1998).
In turn, interviewees from each case were selected because they:
.
had vast experience in managing network organisations in
manufacturing and services industries entering Australia and Asian
markets and were resident in Australia;
.
were owners/managers of firms networking with other overseas firms;
and
.
were decision makers/network advisers.

<-----Page 11----->Other interviews were also held with consultants and others experienced with
Australia/overseas Chinese networks to triangulate the findings from the case
networkers, and some cases had dealt with mainland Chinese as well as
overseas Chinese. Each interviewee was capable of contributing to insights and
the understanding of the phenomena being studied. The total of 24 in-depth
interviews conducted in this research is in the range of 20-50 respondents
recommended by Griggs (1987) and considered to be appropriate by several
other researchers (for example, Larson, 1992; Perry, 1998).
The limitations of case research were overcome by developing several
strategies, for example, by the development of prior theories, specific research
questions and theoretical replication logic described earlier (Yin, 1994). More
particularly, validity in the research was assisted by using multiple sources of
evidence (Yin, 1994) and not relying solely on one interview with a manager at
each network organisation. This “triangulation of sources” (Patton, 1990, p. 464)
included several in-depth interviews, documents collected from network
organisations, newspaper and magazines, and field observations. In addition,
interviewees reviewed an early draft of interview transcripts and reported no
inaccuracies. Given this triangulation, the results in Tables V-VII can be taken
as valid for the network organisations concerned.
As well, reliability was achieved using a case study interview protocol for
each interview which outlined the standard questions used in all interviews.
Each interview began with introductions, thanks, objectives, agenda and ethical
issues such as disguising the network organisations in the report and ensuring
that informed consent was given (Emory and Cooper, 1991; McDaniel and Gates,
1991), followed by broad non-directive questions about their experiences in
building and managing networking activities like “Would you please tell me the
story of your experiences in developing and managing business links with other
overseas organisations?” After these broad questions, narrower probe questions
were prepared about specific issues developed from the literature that may not
have been covered in the answers to the earlier, broad questions. Examples of
these questions are: “How did you first become aware of the potential partners
for your business links in Australia and overseas? Have you been involved in
situations where your links with other Australian and overseas Chinese
business links were terminated? What were the circumstances leading to those
terminations?” The questions in the protocol did not have to be asked in any
order and were inserted into the “conversation” of the interview as appropriate
(Carson et al., 2001). The interviews were all tape-recorded and transcribed.
Double checking the interview transcripts for accuracy using three independent
research assistants further enhanced reliability.

Findings
RQ1. Entrepreneurs’ awareness of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions
RQ1 concerns the extent to which overseas Chinese and Australian business
people are aware of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as the foundation to the
understanding of Chinese perspective of culture compared to the Australians.
The results of the interviews are summarised in Table V and offer insights
about knowledge and understanding of these cultural dimensions and about
how they are likely to affect inter-firm relationship development between
overseas Chinese and Australian business people.
The overseas Chinese cases. The overseas Chinese appeared to be aware of
most of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and considered them to be important in
most Chinese dealings because “you have to do things implicitly and in culture
sensitive ways” (Case C2:10), as shown in Table V. Indeed, some interviewees
used the same terms as Hofstede did. Each cultural dimension is briefly
discussed later.
Cases described their understanding of collectivism in terms of group/family
orientation, but also emphasised variation among Chinese. Cases D and E
composed of Chinese from Hong Kong and case F of Singaporean Chinese
placed less emphasis on group orientation than those Chinese from mainland
China (cases C and E), because of the former’s exposure to Western ideologies.
“The cultural values are changing especially in Singapore and Hong Kong
where they have been exposed more to Western influence for many years than
Mainland China or Taiwan and are starting to adopt individualistic values”
(D2:18; E1:13), while the “Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese are still more
family oriented” (D2:18) and “business and family matters merge” (C2:14).
Most cases described power distance in terms of master-servant relationship
and person’s status in the organisation/society. A person’s status in an
organisation is considered important for determining the level of business
dealing because “in high power distance culture such as in China, decisions
tend to be autocratic so that you target your business search/dealing with key
decision makers within the organisation” (C2:4).
Femininity, caring about other people’s feeling and well-being, was the
second least emphasised cultural dimension, but was more evident in the
predominantly Chinese networks of cases C and F. “In Chinese culture, the boss
is supportive and is expected to play a father-like figure because in Chinese
culture, caring and having personal relationship [femininity] and business are
closely related. It is something to do with hierarchy of Chinese relationship”

<-----Page 16----->EJM
37,11/12

1564

(C2:11). In contrast, this appeared not to be the case in the West because
“Westerners tend to be very business-like [masculinity] all the time and are not
sensitive to other person’s feelings or problems” (C2:11; D2:18).
Uncertainty avoidance, the tendency to plan and avoid risk, was the least
emphasised cultural dimension by the Chinese. Instead of putting in place
conventional risk protection practices such as insurance or legal contract,
Chinese opt to build strong personal relationships with their counterparts to
avoid risk. That is, “Chinese tend to build a much closer personal friendship
with fellow Chinese than they would with non-Chinese as a protective measure”
(B2:6) or “be part of the gaunxi network” (C2:11).
All Chinese cases expressed the Confucianism dimension in terms of face. That
is, “face is so important in all aspects of Asian interactions, that it is designed to
avoid confrontation, embarrassment in case of failure to deliver and where
conflicts arises between people” (D1:9). The interviewees provided many
examples where Chinese save face such as “operating in grey area, that is, not
giving 100 per cent Yes or 100 per cent No answer” (D1:9; D2:8; E2:8), “taking a
neutral position in difficult situations” (C2:27) and “resolving conflicts through
trusted third party” (C2:10). Like collectivism, emphasis on the value on face is
changing. “In the old Chinese world, face is everything, but in the Westernised
Chinese world, face is viewed in terms of how much it is worth in tangible and
economic values when deciding whether to continue with the relationship” (A2:8).
The Australian cases. In contrast, only three out of six Australian cases
showed some awareness of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions of their partners and
were those cases that interacted with mainland Chinese as well as with
overseas Chinese (shown with a tick in Table V). Subsequently, the
understanding of each cultural dimension by the Australian business people
is discussed briefly.
Individualism/collectivism. The Australian business people viewed the
individualism dimension to be important. “The biggest cultural difference
between the West and Chinese is that Chinese are family oriented [collectivism],
while in the West, each person tends to take care of themselves” (H2:34). For
femininity, Australians viewed its importance in terms of building a
relationship. “In my business, I always develop a trusting and caring
relationship with my Chinese counterparts rather than simply getting
concerned with money making as most Australians do” (L1:24; L2:35).
Only three Australian cases noted that power distance related to paying
attention to a person’s status in an organisation. “It is important for Australians
to understand the source of decision-making power when dealing with Chinese
as they are conscious of status of a person in the community and organisation.
You must identify a person’s position in the organisation so as to engage people
of equal playing field as well as give the Chinese counterpart face” (L2:10).
Uncertainty avoidance was emphasised by most Australian cases as most
Australians are risk averse when doing business in an unfamiliar environment. “I

<-----Page 17----->think Australian business people want to do business in lowest risk environment
possible with the people they know” (J1:22). The interviewees further claimed that
“Australians are reluctant to enter into anything that is high risk and people who
are different are unfortunately seen as being risky” (J1:28). Thus, “Hofstede’s
uncertainty avoidance seem to have got pretty right there” (J1:22).
Only a few cases were aware of the cultural dimension of Confucian
dynamism and its importance when interacting with Chinese. “Westerners
such as Australians like confrontation to make a point but to Chinese that is
wrong” (H1:9). However, some Australian interviewees conducted themselves
in the manner that saves face, but that came with experience. That is, “in
conducting business in Confucian society, it is important to know what is polite
and what is not polite. The more you do business with Chinese, the more you
learn and know how to do things that saves face of the other party” (H2:20).
Cross-nation comparison. Overall, it appears that being aware of Hofstede’s
cultural dimensions enabled networkers to be more culturally sensitive to their
business partners when building network relationships. However, some Australian
networkers did not appear to appreciate the significance of these cultural
dimensions when building network relationships with their overseas Chinese
counterparts. “Australians trading with Chinese still have a lack of understanding
of those cultures of Asian markets such as the Chinese culture” (K1:18).
In contrast, Chinese are more aware of both Chinese and Western cultures –
“they are able to adjust their business dealings to suit their partners’ culture
orientation” (C1:23). It was noted that most adjustments will need to come from
the Australian side. “Anyone who is aware of the future potential of Chinese
market will be keen to make a few adjustments to fit with Chinese business
culture” (L2:10). Incidentally, industry type, that is, services or manufacturing
in Table III, had no influence on determining the number of cultural dimensions
that each networker was aware of.
RQ2. Relevance of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions to inter-firm network
development
In RQ2, the five Hofstede’s cultural dimensions were hypothesised as having a
positive, negative or neutral impact on each relationship development stage, as
shown in Table III. The findings about these impacts are summarised in
Table VI. The findings were derived from answers to projective questions
about a story presented in the interview, and the content analysis of the
answers to many other questions. Only the differences between actual results
and the expected direction of influence on network development from the
literature need to be discussed here. These differences are shown in Table VI.
Overseas Chinese cases. There was no difference between the expected and
actual results in the overseas Chinese networks, as shown in Table VI. That is,
the data supported the hypothesised greater or lesser relevance of each cultural
dimension on each stage of network development suggested from the literature.

1566

Australian cases. The findings showed that the Australian respondents
possessed levels of collectivism, femininity, and low uncertainty avoidance, and
were medium on Confucian dynamism. All of these were contrary to the
expectations of cultures of a Western country under Hofstede’s (1980, 1991)
categorisation. The overall insight of these findings is that Australians operated
in ways similar to the overseas Chinese for they are good learners of what to do,
even though they may not be very aware of Chinese culture and expectations
(RQ1). Indeed, the Australian respondents indicated that the overseas Chinese
prefer dealing with Australians rather than Americans, because “the Americans
are inflexible, treat them very roughly and think they are superior, while
Australians were quick to align themselves to the Chinese ways of doing
business” (H2:20). This overall similarity between the Australian and the
overseas Chinese networkers suggests a growing convergence of the two
business systems and cultures. That is, the Australians involved in forming
business networks with overseas Chinese were “good learners” and knew what
overseas Chinese expected networkers to do. However, the Australian low power
distance rating (column 3 in Set B in Table VI) indicates that Australians remain
egalitarian (and do not adapt to the high power distance of the Chinese).

RQ3. Strategies for developing and maintaining quality inter-firm network
relationship
RQ3 concerns strategies for developing and maintaining quality relationship in
cross-cultural networks such as overseas Chinese/Australian networks. The
extant literature emphasises the need to recognise cultural difference (Hofstede,
1983, 1991, 1993, 1994a,b ; Kale and McIntyre, 1991; Wincott, 1992), and the use
of a local agent/interpreter (Vanhonacker and Pan, 1997; Wincott, 1992) but
other strategies that might be applied were not explicitly addressed. This
research’s interview data are summarised in Table VII, and are consistent with
this literature about recognition and understanding of partners’ culture being
most emphasised. However, this research also identified four other strategies:
building a personal relationship, cultural sensitivity training, flexibility and
establishing common interest.
Recognition and understanding of a partner’s culture. The extant literature
emphasises the importance of understanding cultural values of exchange
actors in international marketing relationships (Buttery and Leung, 1998;
Hofstede, 1980, 1991; Sekaran and Snodgrass, 1990). The results of our research
are consistent with the literature, for all the Chinese cases emphasised the need
to understand partners’ cultures (Table VII). That is, “you need to recognise the
partner’s culture, appreciate it, join people of that culture, follow their ways of
doing things and then it becomes easy to build and maintain a network
relationship” (E1:14). Moreover, in China the guanxi system ensures the
survival and prosperity of groups of people within the Chinese society. Thus,

<-----Page 19----->“Western business people must gain through understanding of the guanxi
concept as well as other cultural values in China” (C1:12).
The extant literature (Lever-Tracy et al., 1991, 1996; Redding, 1992, 1995) did not
make clear how to go about closing this gap. But our Chinese interviewees indicated
that “you need to set aside the stereotype views about other cultures including their
business practices, accept the cultural difference as a reality in business and find
ways to take advantage of each culture’s strength for mutual benefit” (B1:11). In
contrast, only a few Australian cases recognised that “it is important they
understand the Chinese culture” (G2:28) or “gain great understanding in their
dealings with Chinese counterparts as Chinese see themselves as coming from the
position of power” (I2:10). Other related strategies suggested by both the overseas
Chinese and Australians include “learn a bit of language to show interest and
efforts in Chinese culture” (C2:12; K2:9; L2:10) for it helps “to reduce the psychic
distance” (C2:12: L2:10), and “undergo cultural sensitivity training” (C2:12).
Investment of time in building personal relationship. All our Chinese
interviewees emphasised building personal relationship as an important basis
for doing business in China. “Building a personal relationship in the initial
stages of developing network relationship with people from other cultures and
concentrating on things of common interest makes the cultural differences
insignificant” (B1:11). Thus, “personal relationship is the foundation to quality
and long-term network relationship” (E2:5). A recent study confirms this
importance of personal relationship as a significant determinant for
maintaining successful seller-buyer relationships (Styles and Ambler, 1997).
In contrast, few Australian cases recognised building personal relationship as
a prerequisite to starting and maintaining stable cross-cultural networks. As one
case noted, “Compared to other Australians who concentrate solely on business
specifics, my approach is to build personal relationship and rapport first and
bring the business issues later” (H1:18; H2:19). Thus, “You need to bridge
people’s [cultural] gap by being hospitable, develop trust in each other and build
a personal relationship as the basis for long-term relationship” (J2:26; K1:20).
The other strategies are summarised in Table VII. In brief, there are several
strategies that exchange actors involved in business networks can use to start,
develop and maintain the later states of the inter-firm network relationship
development process for entry into the Australian/overseas markets and these
strategies make for a complex and dynamic arena in which inter-firm network
relationships are developed and maintained. The findings show important
cultural, social and economic aspects of inter-firm network development that
apply in dealings between any two cultures, and not just Australian and
overseas Chinese ones.
Conclusions and managerial implications
Based on the results of interview data for RQ1, the differences in the way
Australian and overseas Chinese understand the cultural dimensions of their own

1567

1568

and those of the counterparts suggest that each group should be culturally
sensitive and better prepared to adjust to the partner’s business culture. Indeed,
most Chinese and some Australian respondents were aware of Hofstede’s cultural
dimensions, how cultures differed between the two countries, and how they were
likely to influence relationship development. More particularly, cultural
differences between overseas Chinese and Australians would seem to be
important in the initial stages of network development. Australian and overseas
Chinese business people build inter-firm networks in a similar manner, but there
is much greater emphasis by overseas Chinese on developing a personal
relationship as a foundation for other relationships. That is, for the overseas
Chinese, the effects of culture on each stage of relationship development were as
predicted in the literature. However, Australian networkers behaved contrarily
from the expectations from literature, except for power distance (as shown in
Table VI). This finding suggests that Australians in overseas Chinese/Australian
networks, quickly learn to do what Chinese expect them to do.
In turn, there are many similarities in the strategies used by the overseas
Chinese and Australian businesses for developing and maintaining quality
cross-cultural networks. In particular, gaining genuine knowledge and
understanding of partner’s culture, sensitivity training, establishing common
ground, developing personal relationship, being flexible and using an
intermediary were most emphasised by both the overseas Chinese and
Australian networkers.
The implications of this research are presented in Table VII. Table VII
builds an initial general framework of strategies that managers/owners of
firms networking with overseas firms could use to develop and maintain
cross-cultural networks for entering Australian and Asian markets. As the
Chinese economy develops further and as more of the young Chinese
entrepreneurs as well as overseas Chinese engage in international trade, and
adjust to various cultures, the differences in the strategies for developing and
maintaining a network relationship may become a blend of those of the West
and Orient, with a consequent shortening of the network development period
and an increase in the evolutionary change of culture. This adaptation of
cultures suggests that national cultures are not as enduring as Hofstede
thought, and that culture is multi-function and multi-level phenomenon and so
attempting to generalise a national culture to groups and individuals should be
done with care. This point was raised in the first section of this paper where
national cultures were raised as merely a starting point for analysis.
Limitations and further research
This research is limited to the influence of culture on relationship development
processes in overseas Chinese/Australian networks entering into Australian
and Asian markets, and excluded other variables that might affect relationship
development such as trust, co-operation, commitment and other relational

<-----Page 21----->factors. As well, this research focused on overseas Chinese/Australian
networks in manufacturing and services industries entering into Australian
and Asian markets. Hence the results of this research are limited to those
network organisations with a profile similar to those in this study. Replication
to other cultures and extension into other types of organisations may be worthy
of further research.
The framework of Table III proposed a link between stages in relationship
development and dimensions of culture for this study of Australian and
Chinese cultures. Other studies could extend the empirical testing to other
Asian cultures with which Australia has significant trading activities. In
addition, the research could be conducted among Western countries, for
example, Australia and France, to see whether inter-firm networks between
these countries have cultural differences that could be investigated in this way.
Furthermore, research of this kind might provide valuable information about
developing cross-cultural networks that will build on the preliminary findings
of this research.
Another limitation of the research was its use of national cultures rather
than group scores. This approach was taken because this was the first
empirical study on the effect of culture on network development, and some
starting point was needed. Moreover, national culture was useful for this
purpose. Nevertheless, more precise research about the multiple levels of
culture should be included in the next step. For example, fresh group and
individual level measures could be taken of the two groups of samples, as some
other cross-cultural studies have done. These measures could more precisely
address any differences that might exist between the overseas Chinese
respondents from different host countries such as Taiwan and Singapore, for
instance. A related issue for further research could be determining whether the
adaptation of the Australians to Chinese culture was due to a general cultural
shift arising from the modern “multiculturalism” of Australia, or to the
individual networkers’ experiences of working with overseas Chinese. Some of
the quotations above suggest that the second explanation is the preferred one,
but more research is needed. Further research could also consider why
Australians have adapted, and not the overseas Chinese.
