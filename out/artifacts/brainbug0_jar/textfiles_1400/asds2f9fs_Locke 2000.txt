Motivation, Cognition, and Action: An Analysis of
Studies of Task Goals and Knowledge
Edwin A. Locke*
University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA
Dans cet article, on commence par analyser la nature de la cognition et de la
motivation, essentiellement dans leurs relations avec le fonctionnement du
subconscient. On y deÂcrit l'interdeÂpendance de la cognition et de la motivation.
Cette interdeÂpendance est illustreÂe avec une analyse des travaux sur la fixation
des objectifs et des strateÂgies appliqueÂes aÁ la taÃche (connaissance de la taÃche)
en relation avec la performance. Trois sortes de relations sont apparues: des
effets directs, seÂpareÂs des buts et des strateÂgies; des interactions entre les buts et
les strateÂgies (la modeÂration), et la meÂdiation de l'impact des buts par les
strateÂgies. On soutient qu'il existe un modeÁle sous-jacent qui rend compte de
tous ces reÂsultats. Il y a deux pistes qui conduisent aÁ la performance, l'une
puisant dans la motivation en faveur des objectifs et l'autre en faveur d'autres
facteurs. Chacune est ou peut eÃtre associeÂe aÁ une connaissance pertinente de la
taÃche. Les effets <directs> du but se manifestent quand les sujets disposent
deÂjaÁ d'une connaissance approprieÂe de la taÃche, mais cette connaissance n'est
pas eÂvalueÂe (si elle eÂtait eÂvalueÂe, il y aurait meÂdiation). Les effets directs de
la strateÂgie apparaissent quand les sujets, pour rechercher ou exploiter des
strateÂgies pertinentes, se sentent motiveÂs par des mobiles (non eÂvalueÂs) qui
ne deÂrivent pas de la performance rechercheÂe. La modeÂration existe quand
aucune connaissance de la taÃche n'est relieÂe aux objectifs, mais que la connaissance provient d'autres sources qui s'articulent avec les buts pour deÂboucher
sur la performance. Quant aÁ la mediation, on y est confronteÂ quand les buts
produisent une connaissance eÂvalueÂe de la taÃche, ce qui distord les effets des
buts quand c'est controÃleÂ. Ce modeÁle ouvre des horizons pour de futures
recherches.
This paper begins by analysing the nature of cognition and of motivation,
especially as they relate to the operation of the subconscious. The interdependence of cognition and motivation is demonstrated. This interdependence is then illustrated through an analysis of studies on goal setting and task
strategies (task knowledge) in relation to task performance. Three types of
relationships have been found: direct, separate effects of goals and strategies;
interactions between goals and strategies (moderation); and the mediation of
goal effects by strategies. It is argued that there is really one underlying model
that accounts for all of these findings. There are two paths to performance,

one motivated by goals and another motivated by other factors. Each is or can
be associated with relevant task knowledge. ``Direct'' goal effects occur when
the subjects already possess relevant task knowledge, but that knowledge is not
measured. (If it were measured, there would be mediation.) Direct strategy
effects occur when subjects are motivated to discover or use relevant strategies
by (unmeasured) motives that are not a product of the performance goal.
Moderation occurs when there is no task knowledge tied to the goals but
knowledge derives from other sources, which combines with goals to produce
performance. Mediation occurs when goals produce measured task knowledge, which, when controlled, vitiates the goal effect. This model suggests ideas
for further research.

INTRODUCTION
In this article, after presenting the necessary conceptual structure, I will look
at the relationship of motivation and cognition with special emphasis on the
goal-setting literature. I will conclude with a model that I believe integrates
the diverse results that have been found in goal-setting research.
It is a virtual axiom that human action is a consequence of cognition and
motivation or, put another way, knowledge (including skill and ability) and
desire. We can observe by introspection that our actions are regulated by
two types of factors: our knowledge of (or beliefs about) what is, and our
appraisal of that knowledge (is it good or bad, important or unimportant?).
Suppose you are driving down a highway and observe another car cut in
front of you. What determines your response? Your perception of the car's
movement, your appraisal of that fact as a danger, and your knowledge of
what to do to avoid the other car. All action above the level of reflexes fits
this pattern in terms of essentials, including both positive (value-seeking) as
well as negative (danger-avoiding) actions and self-initiated as well as
responsive actions. (I am not claiming here that all aspects of knowledge and
motivation are conscious, as I will explain below.)
Let us consider cognition first.

COGNITION
Consciousness is the faculty for perceiving reality (Peikoff, 1991). The field
of cognition in psychology deals with the question: ``what is?'' or more
specifically, ``what do I know, including what do I know how to do?''
Knowledge includes: sense perception (the base of all knowledge), conceptual identification (the integration of perceptual material), stored
perceptual and conceptual knowledge (memory), and skill (the ability to
do something). Knowledge above the perceptual level is gained through
active processing of information (thinking) and feedback from action. All
this encompasses the whole realm of cognitive psychology, including learning,
memory, problem solving, and decision making.

The conceptual or thinking level of consciousness operates volitionally
(Binswanger, 1991). Reason, the faculty that integrates sensory material, is
the faculty of volition; the choice to think or not to think is a causal primary
(see Binswanger, 1991 for validation). The fundamental choice involves
raising one's level of focus from the perceptual level to the conceptual level
and sustaining that focus or letting one's mind drift passively at the mercy
of random stimuli or emotions. This choice can readily be observed and
validated by introspection. For example, in reading a book one can let one's
eyes pass over the page, looking only at the marks on the paper, or try to
understand what the words and sentences actually mean.
Some psychologists dismiss the method of introspection as invalid, but
such dismissal is self-contradictory. How could one know, in any given case,
that introspection was in error without first knowing what was correct?
Introspection can be in error just as addition and subtraction can be in
error, but we do not dismiss the science of mathematics in consequence. The
challenge for psychologists is to identify the conditions under which introspective information is most accurate (e.g. see Ericcson & Simon, 1980).
Turning now to the concept of the subconscious, I argue that the subconscious is a fully objective concept; it refers to all the knowledge or mental
content that is in consciousness but not, at a given time, in focal awareness.
The concept is discovered by introspection and inference. We observe that
we know things (e.g. what is my mother's maiden name?) and also that we
do not hold that knowledge in focal awareness until it becomes relevant to
some purpose. We ask ourselves: where did the knowledge go when I was
not holding it in awareness? We say, metaphorically, that the knowledge was
``in storage'' as if the information were on a computer disk which we can
access on demand. The metaphor is an apt one. Since we know from studies
in psychology that one can only hold about seven separate items in focal
awareness, it means that virtually everything we know (99.999999%) is
stored. Unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious has an enormous
storage capacity; it can hold many millions of ``bits'' of information.
Furthermore, we can observe that the subconscious operates automatically; it is not the locus or source of free will. Basically, it stores what comes
into focal awareness or partial awareness. Awareness starts with perceptual
experiences. But the distinctive form of human cognition is not perceptual
but conceptual; thinking is our means of survival. What goes into our
subconscious reflects the amount and quality of our thinking. Thus if we put
in garbage, that is, fuzzy, garbled, self-contradictory ideas, that is what will
come out. On the other hand, if we put in well-organised ``file folders'', that
is, clear concepts and definitions tied together logically, we can readily pull
out organised knowledge.
Subconscious storage is essential to learning, because if we could not
``store as we go'', our minds would not be free to focus on new facts and

<-----Page 3----->MOTIVATION, COGNITION, AND ACTION

411

make new integrations and all our conscious effort would add up to nothing.
Knowledge, or what passes for knowledge, gets pulled out of the subconscious and into focal awareness by association and by our conscious
purposes. An example is talking. In an adult, all the word meanings and
principles of grammar needed to speak are automatised. When we want
to articulate a thought, most (though not all) relevant ideas, words, and
expressions automatically come into awareness. Otherwise we would be
unable to carry on anything but the most primitive of conversations. The
same principle holds for reading. The subconscious, of course, can be
reprogrammed, by, for example, consciously correcting previous errors.
All skilled actions are highly automatised, though it would be wrong to
claim that they are totally automatised. For example, in driving, there are
many highly automatised elements (e.g. steering wheel adjustments) but one
still has to pay careful, conscious attention to the traffic conditions and to
one's speed. This is why it can be dangerous to talk on your car phone when
driving. Similarly, in reading one may already know the meanings of each
individual word in the text, but one has to focus consciously on the meaning
of the sentences and their logical sequence in order to grasp what the author
is saying.

MOTIVATION
If cognition answers the question ``what is?'' then motivation answers the
question ``so what?'' What is the significance or importance of what is, what
one perceives or knows? A correlate of assessing an object as significant is
the arousal of action. The four key concepts in motivation are: needs (the
objective requirements of physical and psychological health); values (that
which one considers good or beneficial and acts to gain or keep); goals and
intentions (the situationally specific form of values, the specific object or aim
of an action); and emotions (the form in which one experiences automatised
value appraisals). The term ``motive'' combines values and emotions; a
motive is the desire for a goal or value.
Motives, values, and/or goals affect action in three ways. First, they affect
what facts we choose to act on. They regulate the direction of action by
focusing attention and activity on value- and goal-relevant behaviour at the
expense of other, nongoal-relevant actions. For example, if eating at a given
time is perceived as most important, housecleaning, shopping, working, and
socialising will be temporarily ignored or postponed.
Second, values and goals affect the intensity of the action (and the
emotion) based on how important the value is held to be. One puts more
energy into actions that entail an important goal or value than to those
which entail something unimportant. One does not take action or feel strong
emotion with respect to something appraised as trivial or irrelevant. How# International Association for Applied Psychology, 2000.

<-----Page 4----->412

ever, due to errors of introspection, conscious estimates of importance may
conflict with subconscious estimates. The difficulty of the goal also affects
intensity; more difficult goals lead to more effort than easy goals.
Third, values and goals also affect the persistence of actionÐhow prolonged it is. Persistence is effort sustained over time. One persists more if
the value or goal is important or harder to attain. One might not bother
to become an expert in chess even though one enjoys it and yet spend
thousands of hours to insure the success of one's business, because the
business is viewed as more critical to one's life and happiness.
Value and goal-directed actions entail both automatic and volitional
elements. Let us consider one automatised factor first, namely, emotions.
Emotions, as noted, are the psychosomatic form in which we experience
our value judgments. Every emotion has a unique form of value judgment underlying it (Lazarus & Lazarus, 1994), for example, guilt is caused
by violating a moral principle, fear is caused by a threat to one's wellbeing, depression is caused by the conviction that one is no good and/or
that life is no good, satisfaction results from having achieved a value.
Emotions contain built-in action tendencies, for example, to approach
objects appraised as favourable and to avoid or destroy those appraised as
harmful (Arnold, 1960).
Emotions may lead to action but they do not necessitate action (psychosis
or brain disorders aside); through reason, we have the power to decide
whether or not to act on a given feeling. We might hate our teachers for
doing something we consider unfair, but we do not physically assault them
even if we might feel like it. On the other side of the same coin, a student's
desire for excellent grades does not automatically push the student to take
the actions required to achieve it. Many distractions and roadblocks can
divert attention from a desired objective. Again, one must use reason to
overcome such obstacles.
Once the individual decides to act to achieve a goal, spurred on or not
by emotion, both conscious and subconscious knowledge come into play.
Consciously one has to ask: how will I go about reaching this goal? How
does it tie into my other goals? How long will it take? How much effort
will be required? Can I do it? What resources will I need? Some of these
questions will pull relevant subconscious knowledge into awareness and
some will require more thinking and information search.
I should note here that needs affect action only indirectly. Needs are the
starting point of motivation in that they stem from the fact that human life,
like that of all living organisms, is conditionalÐthat is, dependent upon a
particular course of action. The course of action required depends on the
organism's nature. Panda bears can live on a diet of bamboo; people cannot.
People need self-esteem, the conviction that they are able to live and worthy
of living; mice do not. The form in which one first experiences needs is

<-----Page 5----->MOTIVATION, COGNITION, AND ACTION

413

through pleasure and pain. Need satisfaction is pleasurable. Need frustration is uncomfortable, painful, and, in extreme cases, life-threatening. However, there is no built-in knowledge of how to satisfy needs. For example,
there is no inborn knowledge of how to find, process, store or transport
food, or even of what one's nutritional needs are. Sailors suffering from
scurvy did not long for citrus fruits, because they did not know what caused
their suffering, but they needed vitamin C nevertheless. Nor do people
automatically act in accordance with their needs; people may act in selfdestructive ways due to errors of knowledge or irrational values, for example,
drug addicts. To survive, what people value must be consistent with what
they need. Drug addicts have a shorter life expectancy than nonaddicts do.
So do drunken drivers.
There is no evidence supporting any built-in need hierarchy. People have
the power to prioritise their needs in different ways, based on their chosen
values, for example, giving up some of one's food to feed a valued friend;
risking one's safety to rescue a loved one from a fire; giving up one's social
life to make a new business venture succeed. Some needs have more
immediately harmful consequences when frustrated than do others, for
example, you die within two or three minutes when deprived of air, within a
few days when deprived of water, and within a few weeks when deprived of
food, but one may live (unhappily) for years deprived of a social life
(although married people do live longer). It is not the case that physical
needs are always more urgent than psychological needs. In the face of zero
self-esteem, one may commit suicide very rapidly. Objective time urgencies
may be ignored, within limits, however, depending on one's values and one's
present context (e.g. diving under water to the point of semiconsciousness in
an attempt to save a drowning child).
Motivationally (that is, cognition aside), the causal path goes from needs
to values to goals. Needs give rise to the requirement of choosing values;
values give rise to the necessity of setting goals; goals direct action. Moving
from the other direction, goals achieve values; values satisfy needs.

THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF COGNITION AND
MOTIVATION
In one respect, motivation has primacy over cognition. Needs are present at
birth, as part of one's nature, even before one has had one's first perceptual
experience. Needs confront us with the requirement of taking the actions
our survival requires, for example, thinking. But when it comes to choice of
action, above the level of reflexive responses, cognition has primacy over
motivation, because one cannot want something without knowing that that
something exists and that it has certain valued attributes (e.g. water slakes
thirst). Nor can one satisfy a need without knowing what the need is and
# International Association for Applied Psychology, 2000.

<-----Page 6----->414

LOCKE

what has to be done to satisfy it. Furthermore, above the level of physical
sensations, motivation is based on values, one's convictions about what
is good or beneficial. Values and goals are chosen or changed based on
thinking. Those who do not choose to think about such issues end up,
by default, accepting the values others have chosen. Similarly, emotions
reflect one's stored knowledge and values and are understood and changed
through thinking, especially introspection.
Although cognition and motivation can be partly isolated for the purpose
of specialised study, in everyday life they are never separate. Every waking
moment, we are, at least implicitly, asking the question: what is, and what
does it mean to me? On the one side, everything one knows is automatically
evaluated by the subconscious, in the form of an emotion, even if it is not
evaluated deliberately and consciously. On the other side, everything one
wants requires some knowledge of the thing that one wants and every action
one takes to get it requires some knowledge of how to do so.
Once people acquire a repertoire of knowledge (e.g. skills and strategies),
these are activated, sometimes, though not always, automatically, when they
decide that they want to achieve a goal and perceive that a certain set of
skills will be instrumental in achieving it. Strategies for achieving goals are
both cognitive and motivational.
The widest cognitive meta-strategy is thinking. A specific cognitive strategy,
which entails thinking of a certain type, would be problem solving. A discrepancy is seen between a desired state A (e.g. needed cash flow) and one's
present state B (bills payable), and one thinks about how to get from state B
to state A (e.g. increase cash flow, reduce expenses). A related strategy is
decision making: one identifies possible alternative courses of action, evaluates them and chooses the most beneficial one (e.g. to steal the money, get
a bank loan, find new investors, put a second mortgage on one's house).
Observe that all the above examples entailed motivational elements. As one
gains experience with various tasks (e.g. accounting, tennis, driving), one
gains task-specific knowledge which is stored in the subconscious and is
automatically activated whenever one performs that task.
As individuals gain increasing task-specific knowledge and skill, they
acquire self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997), the conviction that they can perform
tasks at a certain level of skill. Although self-efficacy is a self-assessment of
capability, a cognitive judgment, it has motivational consequences. People
with high task-specific confidence exert more effort, respond more positively
to negative feedback, set higher goals and choose better task strategies than
people with low confidence.
The widest motivational meta-strategy is effort. Most children learn from
an early age that if you try hard (and try persistently) you are more likely to
succeed at a task than if you do not try hard, in other words, if at first you
don't succeed, try, try again. Thus when confronted by a difficult goal, one

<-----Page 7----->MOTIVATION, COGNITION, AND ACTION

415

of the first things that usually comes to mind is: I have to work hard and not
quit if I am going to succeed. Effort is both mental and physical. Cognitive
effort involves the effort involved in thinking; action effort involves the
effort involved in carrying out plans of action and executing (and developing) skills.
To summarise, cognition and motivation, which most fundamentally involve
thinking and effort, always go together. All thinking requires some degree of
value-directed effort and all effort involves either thinking or the application
of thinking. This much we know from introspection without any need for
psychological experiments.
What is interesting to study is the specific manner in which cognition and
motivation work together to affect action. Industrial-organisational psychologists often state that behaviour is a function of motivation times (or
plus) ability (knowledge); this is true but how to study this relation is not
self-evident.
Few research paradigms in psychology have looked specifically at how
motivation and cognition operate jointly to affect action. In I/O psychology,
people have looked at prediction equations that include both motivational
and cognitive factors (e.g. ability plus personality, as in Howard & Bray,
1988), but these studies were designed for practical usefulness in prediction,
not theory development. In the research conducted, it seems that additive
models do better than multiplicative models.
Goal setting studies, in contrast, were typically designed for the purpose
of theory building. Goal setting is primarily a theory of motivation and
much of the research has looked at the effect of effort (including persistence)
and direction of effort on task performance. Goal setting theory argues, in
brief, that specific, difficult goals lead to better performance than ``do best''
or easy goals and that goal effects are moderated by feedback and goal commitment (Locke & Latham, 1990). In most studies ability (task knowledge
or skill) has been controlled so that the effect of goal attributes could be
isolated. However, even in the studies using simple tasks such as brainstorming or addition, it was assumed that individuals had some knowledge
of how to perform such a task and that goals would activate this knowledge.
Thus one could say that task knowledge was present in all subjects to some
degree (even if it was not measured). In such studies there is characteristically a main effect for goals (e.g. goal difficulty) as well as a main effect
for the control variable, ability (if measured).
As tasks become more complex, however, the theoretical issues become
more challenging (Locke & Latham, 1990). In more complex tasks, not
everyone can be assumed to have the relevant knowledge, though some
people might. Often the relevant knowledge needs to be discovered, and
some people might discover it and others might not. Henceforth I will use
the term ``task knowledge'' to refer generically to ability, tactical task knowl# International Association for Applied Psychology, 2000.

<-----Page 8----->416

LOCKE

edge, and strategic task knowledge. The concepts of strategy and tactics
come from the military, where strategy refers to the grand plan and tactics
refer to local actions aimed at making the strategy work. Thus in a battle the
strategy might be a flanking movement, whereas the tactics could involve
ground forces, paratroops, helicopters, and/or tanks used in various
combinations to capture specific strongholds.
Three types of relationships have been obtained between goals, task
knowledge, and performance:
1. Independent main effects of goals and task knowledge.
2. Interactive effect of goals and task knowledge.
3. Mediation effects, whereby task knowledge mediates the effect of goals.
Most goal setting studies have been done at the individual level but group
goal setting studies reveal the same basic relationships as those found at the
individual level (O'Leary-Kelly, Martocchio, & Frink, 1994). Furthermore,
goal setting studies have used many different dependent variables and types
of tasks (Locke & Latham, 1990). These issues are not addressed in the
discussion that follows.
In what follows I will (a) give examples of each type of relationship, (b)
interpret the meaning of each relationship, and (c) provide an integrative
model that encompasses all three types. Finally, I will argue that there is
really only one model that accounts for all of the results.

Independent Effects of Goals and Task Knowledge
Many studies have found separate main effects for goals and ability. Locke,
Frederick, Lee, and Bobko (1984) found that both brainstorming ability and
goals affected brainstorming performance; in addition the use of trained
strategies for thinking up uses for common objects had an independent
effect. Self-efficacy affected both goals and performance. The results of this
study are shown in Fig. 1. This study is noteworthy in that it shows that
even with simple tasks, task strategies can affect how well one performs.
However, independent effects for goals and task knowledge have also
been found for complex tasks. Taylor, Locke, Lee, and Gist (1984) found
faculty research productivity was affected by both productivity goals and the
use of a strategy that involved working on multiple research projects at the
same time. Self-efficacy affected both goals and strategies as well as productivity.
In a series of studies, Wood and his colleagues (see Locke & Latham, 1990,
chapter 4) found independent effects on a factory production simulation
task of self-set goals, analytic strategies,and self-efficacy. (There were partial
mediation effects, to be described later.)
Chesney and Locke (1991), using a strategic management simulation, found
independent effects of self-set goals and business strategies on performance,

although the strategy effect was much stronger than the goal effect. (An
interaction effect will be discussed below.)
In a macro-level study with an even more complex task than any of those
used above, Baum, Locke and Smith (in press) obtained similar findings.
Small venture owners' self-set goals for company growth and the business
strategies they used independently affected subsequent growth. This result is
shown in Fig. 2. Note that self-efficacy also had an independent effect on
performance.
An interesting finding of studies which use complex tasks is that often
self-set goals are related to performance even though assigned goals are
not (e.g. Wood's studies). Assigned goals are correlated with self-set goals
around 0.50, on the average. With simple tasks both types of goals typically
predict performance, though self-set goals work better. With complex tasks,
it may be that the self-set goals more closely take account of whether individuals believe that they possess suitable task knowledge, and thus are more
aligned with what they can actually accomplish.
Several studies have found that goals and planning, as opposed to actual
plans (task strategies), are separately related to performance. Weingart
(1992) found this with a group assembly task. Goals affected performance
``directly'' and partly through their effect on effort. Goals also affected some
types of planning but the types of planning related to performance were not
related to goals. Smith, Locke, and Barry (1990) found that goals affected
performance on a management simulation task and that the combination of
planning quality and time spent planning also had a direct effect on performance. (A partial mediation effect will be reported below.)
In a unique study, Audia, Locke, and Smith (in press) found that goals
and the use of previously successful strategies were both negatively related to

subsequent performance in a business simulation in which the strategies that
led to success in early trials were rendered ineffectual due to a simulated
environmental change. In this case strategic persistence accompanied by
challenging goals and high efficacy made performance progressively worse,
because they motivated people to do the wrong thing.

Interactions between Goals and Task Knowledge
Several studies have obtained interactions between goals and task knowledge, on complex tasks. Chesney and Locke (1991), as noted earlier, found
main effects for both goals and strategies in a business strategy simulation
study. The main effect for strategy was by far the stronger effect but there
was also a significant interaction effect for one of the two dependent variables.
The association between goals and performance was significantly higher
when good versus poor business strategies were used. There was no mediation
effect of strategies.
A similar finding was obtained by Durham, Knight, and Locke (1997) in
a laboratory study in which teams played a computerised battle simulation
game. The teams were led by one of two types of leaders: commanders, who
took total control of all team activities, and coordinators, who helped team
members communicate and coordinate their battle tactics. Teams with coordinators developed more effective team tactics than those with commanders.
There was a main effect of quality of team tactics on performance and a
significant interaction between tactics and team-set goal difficulty. Goal
difficulty was significantly related to performance for teams that used good
tactics but not for teams that used moderate or poor tactics. This result
is shown in Fig. 3. Goals were not related to team tactics; thus there could
be no mediation effect.
Earley and Perry (1987) obtained interactions by more subtle means.
In two studies they primed subjects with strategies that were suitable or
unsuitable for the task at hand. Hard goals motivated subjects to use the
primed strategies. Hard goal subjects with suitable strategies performed
better than subjects with other combinations of goals and strategies. This
same result was found in a number of other studies (Earley, Connolly, &
Lee, 1988; Earley, Lee & Lituchy, 1989; Shaw, 1984).

Mediation of Goal Effects byTask Knowledge
A number of studies have found that goal effects have been partially or fully
mediated by task knowledge. In a complex multiple cue probability task,
DeShon and Alexander (1996, study 2) found that the strategies subjects
developed in order to identify the correct weights for the various cues fully
mediated the effect of goals on performance. Locke and Kristof (1996)

found that the effect of student grade goals on performance was partly (in
the case of grade point average) and fully (in the case of a particular course
exam) mediated by the study strategies used by the students.
In a study using a moderately simple assembly task, Audia, Kristof-Brown,
Brown, and Locke (1996) found that personal goals and the work processes
people used to perform the task fully mediated the effect of assigned quantity
goals on performance and partly mediated the effect of assigned quality goals
on performance. Work processes partially mediated the effect of personal goals
of both types of performance.
Durham, Locke, Poon, and McLeod (2000) assigned goals to teams
working on a ``Winter Survival'' task in which they had to rank 15 objects in
terms of their usefulness for survival after a plane crash. Teams could buy
clues that would give hints as to the survival value of the various objects. It
was found that more difficult team-set goals (set in terms of the discrepancy
between team rankings and expert rankings) led to the buying of more clues.

The number of clues sought completely mediated the effect of goals on
performance. These results are shown in Fig. 4. Survival strategy, which in
this case meant choosing either to stay with or leave the crashed plane, was
independently related to performance. Choosing to stay with the plane, the
correct decision, affected the usefulness of the various objects (e.g. a
compass) and thus led to more accurate choices.
Durham and Locke (1998), using the simulated battle game described
earlier, found that tactics, rather than interacting with team-set goals,
partly mediated the effects of team-set goals on performance. In another
study using the same battle simulation, Knight, Durham, and Locke
(2000) found that goal effects were partly mediated by strategies. Smith et al.
(1990) found that goal effects were partly mediated by the combination
of planning time and planning quality. Finally, the Wood studies found
that analytic strategies partly mediated the effect of self-set goals (see Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
Let us now discuss the conditions under which each relationship would be
expected to occur:
1. Independent effects should occur when: (1) the individual or group
possesses some existing task relevant knowledge which is not measured
but which the goal activates (I do not mean that harder goals necessarily
activate more knowledge than easier goals, rather the harder goals may
simply drive the application or processing of the knowledge more rapidly

or forcefully than the easier goals; Schmidt & Kleinbeck, 1990; Wegge &
Dibbelt, in press); and (2) the individual or group possesses or discovers
additional task knowledge which is not activated by the goal but which they
have the motivation to act on. Such other motivation was not measured in
these studies but may have come from the desire to succeed, personal interest
in the task, and other motives (Schiefele & Rheinberg, 1997) including traits
(dispositional factors). This model is shown in Fig. 6a. As I will explain
shortly, there appears to be a main effect of motivation because task knowledge is not measured yet present. Similarly there appears to be a knowledge
effect independent of motivation because other motives were not measured
yet presumed present.

2. An interaction between goals and task knowledge should occur when:
(1) the individual or group has a goal that does not, by itself, activate
relevant preexisting task knowledge nor drive the person to discover or
utilise such knowledge; (2) task knowledge is available (e.g. provided) or
is discovered or aroused independently of the goal. High performance will
result under the combination of high goals and high knowledge. This model
is shown in Fig. 6b. There can be a main effect of knowledge in this model
too, if there is sufficient motivation to apply the knowledge, although Earley
and Perry (1987), as noted above, found that hard goals increase the
likelihood that relevant task knowledge will be used when it is available. In
their studies subjects were not motivated to use the task knowledge provided
without the impetus of hard goals.
3. Mediation effects should occur when: (1) the goal arouses or leads to the
discovery and/or application of relevant, task knowledge; and (2) this
knowledge is measured. Partial mediation will occur when (1) and (2) hold
but there is some additional knowledge, not driven by goals, available and
the motivation to use it. This model is shown in Fig. 6c.
What is found, then, is a matter of (a) where the locus of knowledge and
motivation are, (b) what knowledge gets aroused by what means, and (c)
what is measured in the study in question. If you have goals with knowledge
plus knowledge from other sources, and the motivation to use it, you get
model 6a. If you have no knowledge accompanying the goals as such but
have knowledge from other sources that you are motivated to use, you get
model 6b. If you have goals with measured knowledge but no knowledge
from other sources, you get 6c (full mediation). In short, the type of
relationship one finds is the result of what knowledge is available and what
is measured.
The bottom line, shown in Fig. 7, is this: to get performance you need
goals that activate or produce task knowledge and/or other motives that
activate or produce task knowledge. This means that, in a certain respect,
there are no literally ``direct'' effects of goals on performance. All performance requires some degree of knowledge. In those studies where ``direct''
effects were obtained, the subconscious knowledge was present but was simply
not measured (even though, in principle, it could have been measured). In
the interaction and mediation studies, it was measured.
All this suggests many interesting studies, specifically studies aimed at
measuring all the relevant components. The most challenging aspect of
such studies will be to identify and measure the subconscious (implicit)
knowledge that people bring to bear on task, over and above the trained or
discovered knowledge. This is difficult because implicit knowledge, being
subconscious, can be hard (though not impossible) to get at. One could
get around it by giving subjects tasks that are new enough that stored

knowledge will not help very much. Then the amount of knowledge they
gain can be both experimentally manipulated and measured. The study that
came closest to this is the previously mentioned experiment by Durham et al.
(2000). We found that people had limited knowledge relevant to wilderness
survival and, more importantly, did not know whether or when their opinions
were correct. Thus they easily gave in to other team members who were
wrong because when there is mutual ignorance (and sometimes even when
there is not), the most aggressive member has the most influence. In this
case, having clues became critical to effective performance.
The other challenge will be to identify motives for applying or discovering
task knowledge that are not driven by specific task goals. Certainly one
motive would be the desire to succeed or do well, even if not tied to a specific
outcome. Passion (love of the work or task) is a variable that has rarely been
studied in the motivational literature. In one study, Baum et al. (in press)
found a direct effect of business owner passion on later success (see Fig. 2).
This is clearly something that should be studied further.

LEARNING
The above discussion has treated goals and knowledge as essentially static.
However, in reality both knowledge and motivation change over time. A
number of studies (e.g. Audia et al., 1996; Chesney & Locke, 1991; DeShon
& Alexander, 1996; Smith et al., 1990; and some Wood studies described in
Locke & Latham, 1990) have found goal effect on complex tasks to become
stronger over time. Fig. 8 shows the results of Smith et al. (1990). Presumably these lagged effects are the result of learning, although it is conceivable
that subjects were increasing their efforts over time. Only Audia et al. (1996)
provided direct evidence that subjects with goals improved goal-relevant
strategy scores over time. Clearly more extensive studies of this phenomenon are needed. Seijts and Latham (1999) found that in some cases learning
goals may improve performance faster than performance goals; these cases
may involve the learning of new and complex tasks. However, learning goals
may not be beneficial unless people know what it is they are supposed to
learn and how to go about it.

In conclusion, I present Fig. 9 as a dynamic version of Fig. 7; it shows that
there can be degrees of already present knowledge and acquired knowledge
in a given case, regardless of the source of the motivation. Future research
on the proposed relationships in Fig. 9 will deepen our understanding of the
relationships between motivation, cognition, and action.
