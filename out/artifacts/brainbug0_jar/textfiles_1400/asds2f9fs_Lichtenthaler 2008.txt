Abstract
Besides applying technological knowledge in products and services, firms may externally leverage their technology assets, e.g.,
by means of technology licensing. Despite its increasing managerial and theoretical importance, outward technology transfer has
been relatively neglected in prior research. We use data from 152 industrial companies to analyze how different levels of
proficiency in managing different stages of the external technology exploitation process influence a firm's out-licensing
performance. With the trend towards open innovation strategies, this research represents an important complement to the large
number of success factor studies into new product development.

1. Executive summary
External technology exploitation refers to commercializing technological knowledge exclusively or in addition to its
application in a firm's own products. Outward technology transfer through various contractual forms, particularly outlicensing agreements, has recently become a major trend in industrial firms. Thus, it goes far beyond a marginal activity
of commercializing residual technological knowledge. By licensing out technology, firms attempt to realize the
strategic and monetary benefits of external technology exploitation. Concerning monetary benefits, various pioneering
firms, e.g., IBM and Dow Chemicals, generate hundreds of million dollars in annual licensing revenues. Despite the
enormous benefits of pioneering companies, however, most other firms face considerable difficulties in managing
external technology exploitation.
This discrepancy between a few successful pioneering firms on the one hand and many unsuccessful companies on
the other cannot be explained by prior research. The limited understanding of successfully managing external
technology exploitation underlines the strong research deficit. Prior research into technology exploitation has focused
on the application of technological knowledge inside the firm, i.e., new product development. Research into
technology transactions, by contrast, has mainly studied the acquisition of external technology. Thus, external

technology exploitation has been relatively neglected despite the trend towards open innovation strategies. External
technology commercialization constitutes the complementary mode of exploiting technology to its internal application,
and it represents the opposite type of technology transaction to the absorption of external knowledge. Due to substantial
differences between internal and external technology exploitation, the insights that may be gained from prior research
are limited.
This article addresses the following key question. How does the management of different process stages affect a
firm's performance in external technology exploitation? Based on a thorough analysis of prior research, the following
five process stages are distinguished: planning, intelligence, negotiation, realization, and control. Consistent with
anecdotal descriptions in prior works, interviews show that these process stages reflect the external technology
exploitation process at the organizational level in practice. We follow research into new product development and
differentiate between the existence of a systematic process per se and a firm's proficiency in managing the major tasks
in the five process stages. On this basis, data from a questionnaire-based study of 152 European companies spanning
multiple industries are used to analyze how the existence of a systematic process and different levels of proficiency in
managing the process stages influence out-licensing performance.
The findings show significant positive effects of a systematic process and of high proficiency in managing the
planning, negotiation and control stages. By contrast, the proficiency of executing the tasks in the intelligence and
realization stages does not have a significant positive impact on performance. In particular, supporting the technology
transfer to the technology recipient during the realization stage does not enhance a firm's performance in external
technology exploitation. Thus, this research may lead us to fundamentally rethink traditional theoretical perspectives
on technology transfer, including university-based technology transfer. Above all, technology transfer performance
seems to be determined to a large degree by managerial activities that accompany the actual technology transfer, i.e.,
planning, negotiation and control.
In the context of increasing managerial and academic interest in externally leveraging technology, this research
constitutes the first detailed analysis of the external technology exploitation process. Moreover, it represents the first
quantitative success factor study into this field which helps explain the discrepancies between a few successful
pioneering firms and many other unsuccessful companies in externally commercializing technology. Thus, this paper
constitutes an important complement to the large number of success factor studies into internal innovation, i.e., new
product development. Accordingly, it deepens our understanding of realizing value from technology in open
innovation systems, with particular emphasis on small and medium-sized companies. Finally, this study has major
implications for emerging themes in knowledge management. As a firm's proficiency in managing the external
technology exploitation process is related to the boundaries of the firm, this study provides support for competencebased approaches to organizational boundaries.
2. Introduction
External technology exploitation refers to commercializing technological knowledge exclusively or in addition to its
application in a firm's own products (Teece, 1998; Lichtenthaler, 2005). Outward technology transfer by means of
various contractual forms, e.g., out-licensing agreements, has recently become a major trend in industrial firms (Rivette
and Kline, 2000; Fosfuri, 2006). Thus, it goes far beyond a marginal activity of commercializing residual technologies
(Chesbrough, 2003; Kline, 2003). By means of technology licensing, firms attempt to realize the strategic and
monetary benefits of externally leveraging technology. Regarding strategic benefits, external technology exploitation
may help firms set industry standards, gain access to external knowledge and realize market entry (Teece, 1998; Arora
et al., 2001). Concerning monetary benefits, various pioneering firms, e.g., Dow Chemical and Lucent Technologies,
generate hundreds of million dollars in annual licensing revenues (Arora et al., 2001). IBM's licensing revenues even
amounted to more than US$ 1.9 billion in 2001, up from merely US$ 30 million in 1990 (Chesbrough, 2003; Kline, 2003).
Despite these benefits of some pioneering firms, however, most others experience major managerial difficulties in
external technology exploitation. “[C]ompanies trying to imitate the success story of for example IBM's licensing
program, often fail to initiate such a deployment program due to market imperfections and the necessary high initial
financial commitment” (Escher, 2003, p. 215). This discrepancy between a few successful pioneering firms on the one
hand and many unsuccessful companies on the other cannot be explained by prior research. These limitations of prior
works underline the strong research deficit, especially regarding the management of external technology exploitation.
The recent increase in technology licensing is a trend from practice, and it has insufficiently been reflected by academic

447

research. In particular, our insights into the managerial challenges along the external technology exploitation process
are limited (Lichtenthaler, 2005).
Prior research into technology exploitation has focused on the application of technologies inside the firm, i.e., new
product development (March, 1991; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995). Thus, external technology exploitation, which
constitutes the complementary mode of exploiting technology, has been relatively neglected despite the trend towards
open innovation strategies (Laursen and Salter, 2006; West et al., 2006). As external technology exploitation differs
substantially from internal innovation (Teece, 1998; Arora et al., 2001), caution is required in transferring insights from
research into new product development (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Ernst, 2002). Similarly, research into technology
transactions, e.g., licensing and alliances, has mainly focused on the acquisition of external technology (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990; Jones et al., 2001). Some insights may be gained from these works because external technology
exploitation represents the opposite type of technology transaction, which is partly similar to technology acquisition.
However, the managerial challenges fundamentally differ from technology absorption (Rivette and Kline, 2000;
Lichtenthaler and Ernst, 2006).
In addition, research into outward technology transfer of firms and universities provides only limited insights. This
stream of research has considerably deepened our understanding of outward knowledge transactions, but it has focused
on the actual technology transfer (Bozeman, 2000; Amesse and Cohendet, 2001), which represents the final stage of the
external technology exploitation process (Lichtenthaler, 2005). However, many firms experience major difficulties in
the stages prior to technology transfer (Escher, 2003). In particular, the identification of technology commercialization
opportunities constitutes a major managerial challenge (Lichtenthaler, 2005). In addition, many insights from
university technology transfer may not directly be adapted to industrial firms, where external technology exploitation
constitutes a complement to applying technology in a firm's own products (Teece, 1998). In particular, strategic
benefits, e.g., setting industry standards, are essential for firms, but they are less important in university technology
transfer (Markman et al., 2005).
Research into interfirm collaboration has shown that managing technology transactions requires a process view
(Doz and Hamel, 1998; Hoffmann, 2005). Most firms that take advantage of external technology exploitation are
deeply involved in acquiring external technology (Escher, 2003). Among other reasons, this finding may be explained
by professional processes of managing technology transactions. The examples of pioneering firms point to the
importance of the process of externally leveraging technology (Chesbrough, 2003). This process is particularly
important for small and medium-sized firms, which may be forced to externally leverage technology due to limited
complementary assets (Arora et al., 2001; Branzei and Vertinsky, 2006). Some early works into external technology
exploitation have adopted implicit process perspectives, but our understanding is still limited to anecdotal descriptions
(Lichtenthaler, 2005).
Therefore, this article addresses the following key question. How does the management of different process stages
affect a firm's performance in external technology exploitation? Based on a thorough analysis of prior research, the
following five process stages are distinguished: planning, intelligence, negotiation, realization, and control. On this
basis, data from a questionnaire-based study of 152 European companies spanning multiple industries are used to
analyze how the existence of a systematic process and different levels of proficiency in managing the process stages
influence a firm's out-licensing performance. In the context of increasing managerial interest in externally leveraging
technology, this research constitutes the first quantitative analysis of corporate external technology exploitation
processes. As such, it also represents the first large-scale success factor study into this field which helps explain the
discrepancies between a few successful firms and many others.
Accordingly, this paper constitutes an important complement to the large number of success factor studies into
internal innovation, i.e., new product development (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995). It deepens our understanding of
realizing value from technology in open innovation systems, with particular emphasis on small and medium-sized
firms (Chesbrough, 2003). In addition, it has major implications for research into technology transfer, including
university technology transfer (Shane, 2004). Finally, this study addresses emerging themes in knowledge
management, e.g., organizational boundaries (Argote et al., 2003). As a firm's proficiency in managing the external
technology exploitation process is related to the boundaries of the firm, this study provides support for competencebased approaches to organizational boundaries (Santos and Eisenhardt, 2005). In recent reviews of the literature on
knowledge management (Argote et al., 2003), external knowledge exploitation (Lichtenthaler, 2005), open innovation
(West et al., 2006) and organizational boundaries (Santos and Eisenhardt, 2005), these issues have been highlighted as
areas ripe for further study.

3. Theory and hypotheses
3.1. Systematization of the process
The size of a firm's technology portfolio determines its external technology exploitation potential, i.e., the volume
of knowledge that may be externally leveraged (Fosfuri, 2006). External technology exploitation per se does not
represent the core business of most industrial firms, and their experience in this field is relatively limited (Teece, 1998;
Escher, 2003). As a result, firms may lack sufficient dynamic capabilities to realize their external technology
exploitation potential. Thus, they do not realize the potential benefits of commercializing technology assets. The
examples of some pioneering companies, e.g., IBM, suggest that the managerial process contributes to a firm's
performance in external technology exploitation (Chesbrough, 2003; Escher, 2003). Various pioneering firms initiated
active out-licensing programs by establishing external technology exploitation processes when they faced financial
difficulties (Rivette and Kline, 2000). Thus, they moved from considering external technology exploitation as an adhoc operation (Lichtenthaler, 2005) towards regarding it as a strategic activity (Davis and Harrison, 2001). These
companies first established a systematic external technology exploitation process before the extent of these activities
rose significantly (Chesbrough, 2003; Kline, 2003).
Further support for the influence of the managerial process on performance could be gained in the interviews that we
conducted at the beginning of this study. One of the companies had recently set up a systematic process to realize its
external technology exploitation potential. Accordingly, the firm did not react to higher licensing revenues, but it
proactively established a systematic process, which may be considered an essential element of developing a dynamic
capability of externally leveraging technology. By realizing learning effects based on prior experience, firms may
reduce the transaction costs in the markets for technology (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Lane et al., 2006). Successfully
managing internal technology exploitation, i.e., new product development, is often used as an example of a dynamic
capability (Teece et al., 1997; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). In that field, prior research has found significant positive
effects of a systematic process on performance (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Ernst, 2002). Despite the differences
between internal and external technology exploitation (Lichtenthaler, 2005; Powers and McDougall, 2006), the
complementary nature of these two modes of exploiting technology points to a positive influence of a systematic
external technology exploitation process on performance.
As many firms simultaneously carry out multiple technology transactions, they have to focus on the aggregate
performance of their external technology exploitation program, in addition to the performance of individual technology
transactions (Fricke and Shenhar, 2000; Kale et al., 2002). The aim to reach an overall optimum is essential because the
local rationality of optimizing the results of an individual transaction may have negative effects on other transactions
due to potential – positive or negative – synergies (Dyer et al., 2001; Hoffmann, 2005). Besides synergies across
technology transactions, firms have to take into account the risks of externally leveraging technology. In particular,
outward technology transfer may contribute to diluting a firm's competitive advantage by commercializing ‘corporate
crown jewels’ (Kline, 2003). Thus, external technology exploitation needs to be closely coordinated with a firm's
product business (Teece, 1998; Fosfuri, 2006). Due to these coordination requirements, it is essential to proficiently
carry out the individual tasks along the external technology exploitation process. In addition, prior research into new
product development (Ernst, 2002) suggests that a systematic external technology exploitation process will positively
affect a firm's performance in commercializing technology assets. In particular, a systematic process facilitates a
successful management of intrafirm and interfirm interfaces (Griffin and Hauser, 1996; Dyer et al., 2001). Hence, we
propose:
Hypothesis 1. The systematization of a firm's external technology exploitation processes is positively related to the
firm's performance in these activities.
3.2. Individual process stages
Besides establishing a systematic process, firms need to proficiently carry out the major tasks that comprise the
process. Following research into new product development, proficiency is understood as the quality of executing the
tasks along the process (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995). Basically, the proficiency level
reflects the degree to which a firm has set up a high-quality process for all major tasks instead of considering external

<-----Page 4----->U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

technology exploitation as a marginal ad-hoc activity with limited quality of execution (Song and Parry, 1997; Ernst,
2002). As external technology exploitation is not the core business of most industrial firms, there are major differences
between pioneering companies, e.g., IBM, and other firms in proficiently managing external technology exploitation
(Davis and Harrison, 2001; Escher, 2003).
Based on a thorough analysis of the literature, we have developed a theoretical model of the external technology
exploitation process that comprises the following five stages: planning, intelligence, negotiation, realization, and
control. Distinguishing these process stages is consistent with prior conceptual descriptions (e.g., Reid et al., 2001;
Escher, 2003). A comparative analysis of the process perspectives in prior research (Lichtenthaler, 2005) has suggested
that these five stages represent the central stages of the external technology exploitation process. Moreover, our
interviews at the beginning of the study have shown that these stages, which have been derived from the literature,
reflect the external technology exploitation process in practice. Usually, the process stages do not follow one another
sequentially but iteratively with feedback loops. In the following, however, a sequential model is presented (Fig. 1). It
does not completely reflect the complexity in practice, but it is a helpful means to discuss the challenges of external
technology exploitation.
3.2.1. Planning
The planning stage constitutes the interface between corporate planning processes and the planning of external
technology exploitation. Prior research has shown that professional planning refers to a high-quality process of
strategic technology planning, target setting, resource allocation and technology customer preselection (George and
Farris, 1999; Lichtenthaler, 2005). Due to the coordinating role of the planning stage, many firms have embedded it
into their strategic technology planning processes by relying on integrated instruments, e.g., roadmaps (Teece, 1998;
Kostoff and Schaller, 2001). If a firm decides to explore the possibilities of a particular transaction, it needs to set clear
targets (Lorange and Roos, 1993; George and Farris, 1999). Then, the firm has to clarify which resources it may
contribute to this technology transaction (Grindley and Teece, 1997; Draulans et al., 2003). Particular attention has to
be paid to the risk of losing idiosyncratic competencies as a result of multiple outward technology transactions (Kline,
2003; Fosfuri, 2006). Afterwards, potential technology customers, e.g., licensees, have to be selected (Dyer et al.,
2001).
These planning tasks are critical for successful external technology exploitation. Besides setting targets,
professional planning comprises the coordination of external technology exploitation with a firm's other technology
management processes, e.g., technology acquisition (Grindley and Teece, 1997). Accordingly, proficient planning is
important for realizing the monetary and strategic benefits of external technology exploitation (Lichtenthaler, 2005).
Firms that lack proficient planning processes are often unable to successfully align internal and external technology
exploitation based on establishing clear technology commercialization targets (Teece, 1998). Moreover, limited
proficiency in the planning stage negatively affects the choice of the right technology customers, which substantially
contributes to performance in outward technology transfer (Arora et al., 2001; Draulans et al., 2003).
In addition, proficient planning is essential for limiting a priori potential negative consequences of outward
technology transfer, e.g., strengthening competitors (Kline, 2003; Fosfuri, 2006). Limited proficiency in the planning

<-----Page 5----->450

stage may therefore result in deteriorating profit margins in a firm's product business (Arora et al., 2001). Consistent
with research into success factors of new product development (e.g., Song and Parry, 1997; Ernst, 2002), proficiency in
the planning stage will strongly enhance a firm's dynamic capability of external technology exploitation by
overcoming ad-hoc activities and developing a strategic approach to outward technology transfer. A professional
execution of the critical planning tasks likely has a major positive impact on a firm's performance in externally
commercializing technology. Hence, we posit:
Hypothesis 2. The proficiency of a firm's planning processes in external technology exploitation is positively related
to the firm's performance in these activities.
3.2.2. Intelligence
Apart from identifying technology commercialization opportunities, a professional intelligence process comprises
the scanning and monitoring of a firm's technological environment, with particular emphasis on the markets for
technology (Lichtenthaler, 2003). Beyond information search, a professional intelligence stage therefore includes the
prior identification of information needs and the subsequent information evaluation and communication (Brockhoff,
1991; Lichtenthaler, 2003). The identification of information needs limits the search space to avoid information
overflow (Frishammar and Hörte, 2005). After information is collected for these needs, the relevance of the information
is determined (Gerybadze, 1994; Lichtenthaler, 2003). This evaluation fulfills additional functions, e.g., organizational
learning (Lichtenthaler, 2003; Powers and McDougall, 2006). Finally, the results have to be communicated to the
relevant persons to facilitate current and future external technology exploitation.
Accordingly, proficient intelligence processes substantially exceed the mere collection of information about
environmental trends (Ghoshal and Kim, 1986; Brockhoff, 1991). Due to imperfections in the technology markets, the
identification of technology commercialization opportunities, which is part of the intelligence stage, usually represents the
critical managerial challenge in externally leveraging technology (Davis and Harrison, 2001; Escher, 2003). A company
owns a technological solution for certain problems, and it faces the difficulty of identifying possible applications, which
may be in completely different industries than the firm's own product business. A high-quality execution of the intelligence
process substantially contributes to establishing links between a firm's technologies and potential applications. Currently,
many firms experience severe problems in linking technologies and applications (Lichtenthaler, 2005). Therefore,
proficient intelligence likely is essential for successfully commercializing technology outside a firm's boundaries.
Besides identifying technology commercialization opportunities, the intelligence stage comprises the identification
of potential risks and the analysis of a firm's environment, e.g., regarding competitors and customers on the markets for
technology (Gerybadze, 1994; Makadok and Barney, 2001). For instance, the commercialization potential of a
particular technology may be substantially reduced by the development of a competing technology which may be
anticipated by means of successful intelligence. Thus, professional intelligence does not only enhance a firm's
performance in internal innovation (Ghoshal and Kim, 1986; Brockhoff, 1991). Instead, it also increases a firm's
technology commercialization capability by identifying opportunities and threats for successful outward technology
transfer. Accordingly, professional intelligence processes that go beyond an ad-hoc identification of technology
commercialization opportunities likely enhance a firm's performance in external technology exploitation. Therefore,
we postulate:
Hypothesis 3. The proficiency of a firm's intelligence processes in external technology exploitation is positively
related to the firm's performance in these activities.
3.2.3. Negotiation
Firms decide on technology transactions after negotiating with the potential technology customers (Doz and Hamel,
1998; George and Farris, 1999). In the literature, prenegotiations and detailed negotiations have been highlighted as the
two key tasks of the negotiation stage (Weiss, 1987; Lorange and Roos, 1993). During professional prenegotiations, a
firm attempts to get a clearer view of its compatibility with the potential technology customer, e.g., licensee (Avadikyan
et al., 2001; Dyer et al., 2001). Apart from developing fundamental understanding and mutual trust, it is essential to
thoroughly evaluate the other firm because many of the issues that are discussed in negotiations are highly confidential
(Contractor, 1985; Zaheer et al., 1998). During the detailed negotiations, the collaborative agreement is set up
(Contractor, 1985).

<-----Page 6----->U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

451

Technology transfer negotiations are usually an iterative process, which may have several rounds, may last more
than a year and may include third parties, e.g., antitrust commissions (Weiss, 1987; Forrest and Martin, 1992).
Accordingly, firms need to develop particular negotiation capabilities to successfully realize the technology
commercialization opportunities that were identified by means of intelligence (Contractor, 1985; Hakanson, 1993). The
negotiation stage is critical for entering into technology transactions and for achieving favorable terms in collaborative
agreements (Contractor, 1985; Hakanson, 1993). The negotiations influence the realization stage and provide important
possibilities of establishing beneficial technology transfer conditions (Hakanson, 1993; Reid et al., 2001). A lack of
proficient negotiation may substantially limit a firm's possibilities of profiting from outward technology transfer
(Rivette and Kline, 2000; Arora et al., 2001).
Thus, the proficiency of negotiation processes likely has a positive influence on a firm's external technology
exploitation performance (Avadikyan et al., 2001; Sherry and Teece, 2004). By means of proficient negotiation, firms
may realize the monetary and strategic opportunities of external technology exploitation. For instance, professional
negotiations are essential for entering into multiple technology transfer agreements to establish a firm's own
technology as an industry standard (Davis and Harrison, 2001; Lichtenthaler, 2005). Accordingly, proficiency in
negotiations goes beyond successfully establishing a single agreement because it includes the successful coordination
of simultaneous negotiations to achieve the firm's corporate goals. The importance of bi-directional technology
transfer, e.g., cross-licensing (Teece, 1998), further underlines the key role of negotiations. Therefore, proficiency in
negotiation processes that goes beyond ad-hoc approaches to individual negotiations may constitute an essential
success factor. Hence, we propose:
Hypothesis 4. The proficiency of a firm's negotiation processes in external technology exploitation is positively
related to the firm's performance in these activities.
3.2.4. Realization
The realization stage starts either immediately or with a certain time lag after an agreement with a technology
customer has been set up (Weiss, 1987; Lorange and Roos, 1993). Proficient realization processes refer to a highquality execution of the design and implementation tasks (George and Farris, 1999; Reid et al., 2001). Proficiently
carrying out the design tasks involves a thorough planning of the technology transfer at an operational level. Moreover,
it includes detailed process mapping to specify the implementation process with particular attention to potential
interface problems and coordination requirements (Harmon and Ardishvili, 1997; Hoegl and Wagner, 2005). Finally, it
is essential to modularize a particular technology as far as possible to facilitate its subsequent transfer (Teece, 1998;
Bozeman, 2000). The implementation tasks refer to the actual technology transfer, which represents the purpose of a
technology transaction (Amesse and Cohendet, 2001). As technological knowledge usually has to be tailored to the
needs of the technology customer, the source firm often has to actively support the transfer process (Forrest and Martin,
1992; Teece, 1998).
Regarding the impact of a firm's processes of realizing technology transactions, two rationales appear plausible.
First, most firms are interested in thoroughly supporting the technology transfer because a successful absorption of the
knowledge at the recipient is critical for an effective technology transaction (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Martin and
Salomon, 2003). Bi-directional technology transfer and performance-related forms of monetary compensation, e.g.,
running royalties in licensing agreements, are common (Sherry and Teece, 2004; Powers and McDougall, 2006).
Therefore, companies may directly benefit from investments in facilitating an effective technology transfer, which
allows the recipient to successfully apply the knowledge (Amesse and Cohendet, 2001; Lane et al., 2006). An
unsuccessful technology application by the recipient will likely limit a firm's benefits from external technology
exploitation. Thus, the effectiveness of supporting the technology customer during the technology transfer process
likely has a positive effect on a firm's external technology exploitation performance.
Second, a firm has to focus on the efficiency of the realization processes. Spending excessive time and resources on
outward technology transfer may negatively affect a firm's internal innovation processes (Escher, 2003; Lichtenthaler,
2005). In many cases, the expert knowledge of R&D employees is required to sufficiently support the technology
transfer (Forrest and Martin, 1992; Arora et al., 2001). In addition, the common situation of bi-directional technology
transfer demands an active participation of R&D experts (Grindley and Teece, 1997). Thus, industrial firms need to
efficiently design and implement their outward technology transfer, which usually does not represent their main
business (Teece, 1998; Fosfuri, 2006). Due to interfirm differences in managing the realization stage, firms may

<-----Page 7----->452

U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

provide effective technology transfer support in an efficient or inefficient way (Amesse and Cohendet, 2001; Martin
and Salomon, 2003). Accordingly, these arguments suggest two different hypotheses.
Hypothesis 5. The effectiveness of a firm's realization processes in external technology exploitation is positively
related to the firm's performance in these activities.
Hypothesis 6. The efficiency of a firm's realization processes in external technology exploitation is positively related
to the firm's performance in these activities.
3.2.5. Control
The control stage refers to the evaluation and control processes of external technology exploitation. Prior research
into alliances has shown that there are many interdependencies between the control stage and the other process stages,
particularly planning and intelligence (Dyer et al., 2001; Hoffmann, 2005). Similar to intelligence, proficient control
processes comprise the identification of information needs, information generation, information evaluation and
information communication (Frishammar and Hörte, 2005; Lichtenthaler, 2005). The identification of information
needs is directed at delimiting the needs to facilitate successful control (Gerybadze, 1994). Besides controlling the
activities of the own firm, attention has to be paid to the technology customer's contribution (Yan and Gray, 1994;
Bozeman, 2000). After generating information (Makhija and Ganesh, 1997; Hoffmann, 2005), its relevance has to be
determined. Apart from evaluating the information, this assessment leads to organizational learning (Lichtenthaler,
2003). Finally, the results are communicated, and a decision is taken whether the activities will be continued or whether
particular technology transactions should be redirected or finished (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Hoffmann, 2005).
Accordingly, proficient control processes exceed the mere collection of internal company data on prior external
technology exploitation activities (Draulans et al., 2003). Due to the possibility of taking corrective actions in a firm's
current collaborative relationships (Dyer et al., 2001), professional control processes may immediately enhance a
firm's performance in external technology exploitation. In the longer term, high-quality control processes will
additionally result in learning effects (Hoffmann, 2005). When transactions are finished, a detailed analysis of their
success or failure constitutes an essential component of the control process (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Draulans et al.,
2003). Only a thorough analysis and documentation of the success factors will allow for realizing learning effects as
experience accumulates (Kale et al., 2002; Walter et al., 2006).
Over time, these learning effects will enhance a firm's capability of externally leveraging technology assets (Teece
et al., 1997). Thus, professional control processes likely are a key determinant of developing an external technology
exploitation capability (Kale et al., 2002; Draulans et al., 2003). By contrast, limited proficiency in the control stage
may result in relatively low performance in outward technology transfer. Similar to control processes in internal
innovation (Ernst, 2002; Frishammar and Hörte, 2005), proficiency in the control stage helps firms overcome ad-hoc
activities and develop a strategic approach to external technology exploitation. Thus, a high-quality execution of the
information-related tasks during the control stage likely has a major positive influence on a firm's performance in
external technology exploitation. Hence, we posit:
Hypothesis 7. The proficiency of a firm's control processes in external technology exploitation is positively related to
the firm's performance in these activities.
4. Methods
4.1. Sample and data collection
The study focused on industrial firms. After a thorough analysis of the literature, we developed a theoretical model
of the external technology exploitation process. In a recent literature review (Lichtenthaler, 2005), a comparative
analysis of different process perspectives in prior research (e.g., Reid et al., 2001; Escher, 2003) showed a high degree
of congruence. This analysis suggested that the five stages planning, intelligence, negotiation, realization, and control
represent the central stages of the external technology exploitation process (Lichtenthaler, 2005). Drawing on this
theoretical model, we formulated hypotheses relating the existence of a systematic process and the proficiency in
managing the process stages to a firm's out-licensing performance. Thus, the theoretical model and the development of
hypotheses were entirely based on the insights from prior research.

On this basis, we conducted interviews to gain a detailed understanding of the external technology exploitation
process in industrial firms. The process perspectives in prior research were mainly derived from conceptual
considerations. Therefore, the interviews were directed at analyzing if the theoretical model reflected the main tasks of
external technology exploitation in practice. After conducting 5 preliminary unstructured interviews, questionnaires
that had been developed based on the literature review were used as a basis for semi-structured interviews.
Furthermore, additional documents, e.g., internal analyses of external technology exploitation processes and external
publications, were studied. This procedure was chosen to respond to the need for deep understanding and local
contextualization (Miles and Huberman, 1994). Moreover, it facilitated a high degree of comparability and provided
ample opportunity for unobstructed narration (Miles and Huberman, 1994). The interview process followed the
suggestions that have been given in the literature (Eisenhardt, 1991; Yin, 2003).
In firms with a dedicated external technology exploitation function, e.g., out-licensing unit, this unit's head was
interviewed. In firms without a dedicated function, the person responsible for technology licensing was
interviewed. In most firms, it was the head of the intellectual property department. In 10 companies, a second
person, who is not directly occupied with technology licensing, was interviewed to get a different assessment of
the external technology exploitation process. Usually, this second informant is active in the R&D department. By
drawing on the insights of this second person, a more detailed picture of the proficiency of a firm's external
technology exploitation process could be gained. Altogether, 35 persons were interviewed in 25 European
industrial firms. 7 of these companies are active in the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, 9 companies in the
automotive/machinery industry and 9 companies in the semiconductors/electronics industry. The choice of
industries was influenced by prior works, which reported different motives of external technology exploitation in
these industries (e.g., Teece, 1998; Arora et al., 2001).
Basically, the interviews reflected the insights that could be gained from the literature (Lichtenthaler, 2005). Some
firms that we interviewed have established a systematic external technology exploitation process. Two companies have
set up processes of five stages that are nearly identical to our theoretical model. A few other firms have established
systematic processes with three or four stages, in which two stages of our process model are integrated into one stage.
Thus, their processes are very similar to our theoretical model. Other companies only mentioned the critical tasks
because they lack a systematic external technology exploitation process. Independent of the existence of a systematic
process, most firms emphasized the same critical stages of the external technology exploitation process that had already
been identified in the literature review. Therefore, the process model that was derived from the literature analysis was
used to conduct a questionnaire-based survey, which was directed at understanding the performance consequences of
the process stages. This combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches followed similar studies in
leading journals (e.g., Denison and Mishra, 1995; McEvily and Marcus, 2005).
To boost the response rate, the survey was supported by the Licensing Executives Society (LES), an organization of
practitioners in the field of intellectual property management. We directly contacted all LES industry members in
Germany, Switzerland and Austria. To reach a representative cross-sectional sample of middle and large industrial
firms, we additionally considered all industrial companies ranked among the 500 largest firms in Germany, among the
100 largest firms in Switzerland and among the 100 largest firms in Austria based on revenues. Due to our focus on
industrial companies and a considerable overlap between the LES member firms and the top 500 firms in Germany and
the top 100 firms in Switzerland and Austria, a total number of 412 companies could be identified as potential
participants.
155 firms participated in the study, corresponding to a response rate of 37.6%. If the confidential nature of the
questions in the survey is taken into account, this response rate can be considered high. A t-test for non-response bias
and for a bias resulting from LES membership showed no significant differences between respondents and nonrespondents regarding different variables, such as firm size. Accordingly, these biases are not present in the data set. Of
the 155 questionnaires, data were sufficiently complete from 152 firms. Despite our assurances of complete anonymity
and confidentiality, however, 16 firms did not disclose their licensing revenues. The number of observations is
therefore slightly lower for the analyses with this measure as the dependent variable. Additional analyses keeping only
the 136 companies that reported licensing revenues show no significant changes in the findings as reported below on
the basis of the full sample. A profile of the sample shows a reasonable spread across industries: automotive/machinery
(42%), chemicals/pharmaceuticals (28%), electronics/semiconductors (18%), and other (12%).
Based on the interviews, we identified the heads of the corporate intellectual property department as key informants.
In firms with a dedicated external technology commercialization unit, e.g., licensing function, the head of this unit was

<-----Page 9----->454

U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

our key informant. Due to the importance of patents in technology transactions (Grindley and Teece, 1997), a firm's
intellectual property department is involved in nearly all of these transactions. Because of the specificity of most
questions, these persons were the only potential informants with sufficient expertise to answer the survey questions.
Apart from their detailed understanding of a firm's current technology commercialization activities, the informants
were able to assess the potential benefits that a firm may realize from externally leveraging technology. Moreover, they
strongly interact with other employees along the process, which has further deepened their knowledge about a firm's
proficiency in external technology exploitation.
Data collection was undertaken via questionnaires administered in English, given that the literature base from
which measurement scales were derived was exclusively in English. Most of the firms in the sample are
international companies with headquarters in one of the three countries included in this study. In addition, pretests
indicated that the language did not compromise a homogeneous understanding of the items among the informants.
An introductory text at the beginning of the questionnaire included a description of the theoretical understanding of
major concepts, including the external technology exploitation process. The measurement scales were specifically
generated for this study based on descriptions and measures of related constructs in the literature (e.g., Cooper and
Kleinschmidt, 1995; Frishammar and Hörte, 2005). Moreover, the insights from our interviews were taken into
account, which reflected the findings of the literature review regarding the stages and content of the external
technology exploitation process. In developing these scales, we followed suggestions in the literature for
developing valid measures (Bagozzi et al., 1991). The complete measurement scales are included in the appendix.
Informants rated all items on 7-point scales. The anchor points for the items were 'I strongly disagree' (= 1) to 'I
strongly agree' (= 7).
4.2. Measures
To ensure validity and reliability of the constructs, exploratory factor analyses, confirmatory factor analyses and
reliability analyses were carried out (Hair et al., 2006). Despite having established a theoretical model of the external
technology exploitation process, exploratory factor analyses were conducted with all items to analyze if the empirical
data support a model with five stages (Hair et al., 2006). Then, confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. After
optimizing the constructs according to the results of the confirmatory factor analyses, we again conducted reliability
and exploratory factor analyses with all constructs, applying the Kaiser criterion to confirm the constructs'
unidimensionality (Gerbing and Anderson, 1988). The findings reflect the stages of the theoretical model, providing
support for distinguishing five stages of the external technology exploitation process.
4.2.1. Independent variables
The first independent variable refers to the existence of a systematic process per se. The three-item scale
(Cronbach's alpha = .95) addresses if a formal process has been established, if this process has been sufficiently
communicated to the persons that are involved in the process and if the relevant interfaces have been defined well.
Beyond the existence of a systematic process, the other variables analyze the quality of executing the tasks in the
individual process stages, following prior research into internal innovation (e.g., Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995). In
the theoretical section, we have described the tasks in the process stages in detail. In the operationalization, we have
focused on the level of the process stages to ensure the interfirm comparability of the results and to facilitate the
understanding of the items. The two-item scale assessing the planning process (Cronbach's alpha = .92) addresses the
proficiency of a firm's planning of external technology exploitation. Thus, the construct captures the quality of
planning the overall program and individual technology transactions. The construct intelligence process (Cronbach's
alpha = .91) describes the proficiency of observing the environment and of identifying technology commercialization
opportunities. Accordingly, the items capture if an effective identification is carried out and if a continuous observation
of the firm's technological environment takes place, particularly with regard to technology commercialization
opportunities.
The negotiation process (Cronbach's alpha = .85) was measured on a two-item scale. As individual negotiations
with potential technology customers may vary considerably, the construct focuses on the general situation in
negotiations due to the firm-level approach of this study. The scale captures the preparation for the negotiations and
the degree to which a firm usually achieves its objectives in negotiations on external technology exploitation. Thus,
the construct addresses the proficiency of a firm's negotiation processes. The scale effectiveness of the realization

<-----Page 10----->U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

455

process (Cronbach's alpha = .89) comprises two items and captures if a firm allocates sufficient resources in order
to facilitate a successful absorption of the technological knowledge at the recipient. Thus, it reflects the
effectiveness of executing the critical tasks in the realization stage. Particular emphasis is put on the support of the
technology transfer that is provided by a firm's R&D employees, who are usually the experts in a particular
technology.
The construct efficiency of the realization process (Cronbach's alpha = .60) describes the degree to which internal
technology exploitation is affected by externally leveraging technology. The four-item scale analyzes the extent of
negative effects on the firm's product business and on the availability of the technology experts for internal R&D.
Furthermore, it takes into account if the technology transfer usually includes a high amount of tacit knowledge which
may require the temporary transfer of employees to the technology customers. As the items are reverse coded, the
construct measures the efficiency of the realization process. Although some of the statistical characteristics of the
construct do not meet all conservative standards, we decided to keep the four items to capture different aspects
regarding content. Additional analyses with a reduced number of items for this construct show no significant changes in
the findings as reported below. The three-item construct control process (Cronbach's alpha = .94) focuses on the
proficiency of controlling a firm's external technology exploitation. Consistent with the construct addressing the
planning process, it captures the proficiency of controlling the individual technology transactions and the overall
program. Furthermore, it considers to what degree the results and insights of the control process are taken into account
in subsequent external technology exploitation.
4.2.2. Dependent variables
To capture a firm's performance in external technology exploitation, we used its revenues in this area and its success
relative to competitors. These variables reflect the performance of the source firm in externally leveraging technology.
However, they also capture overall technology transfer performance. Regarding monetary performance, a firm's
licensing revenues often depend on successful technology absorption at the recipient, e.g., running royalties (Sherry
and Teece, 2004). Concerning strategic objectives, successful technology absorption is essential to achieve major
strategic benefits of outward technology transfer (Lichtenthaler, 2005). To establish a firm's technology as an industry
standard, for instance, the recipients have to successfully incorporate the technology in their products. Accordingly, the
measures are not limited to a single firm's success in external technology exploitation, but they also reflect overall
technology transfer performance.
A firm's annual revenues from externally leveraging technological assets capture exclusively the monetary
dimension of external technology exploitation. They refer to a firm's revenues from licensing out and selling
technology assets. Thus, this variable takes into account to what degree a firm can appropriate its share of revenue in
external technology commercialization. Due to the high confidentiality of this information in most firms, which had
been emphasized in the pretests, the revenues were measured in the following five categories: EUR 0–5 million, EUR
5–20 million, EUR 20–50 million, EUR 50–100 million, and over EUR 100 million. Thus, the first category includes
firms with low licensing revenues or no licensing revenues at all. The correlation coefficient between this variable and
the subjective measure ‘The return on our investments in external technology exploitation is high’, which was
measured on a 7-point scale, is .82 (p b .01). Accordingly, licensing revenues also seem to be a good proxy for capturing
a firm's profitability in commercializing technology assets. However, we focused on revenues as an objective success
variable to limit common method bias.
The variable success relative to competitors (Cronbach's alpha = .92) was measured using three items capturing a
firm's performance in external technology exploitation relative to the firm's direct competitors. Beyond analyzing a
firm's licensing revenues, this measure takes into account strategic aspects, e.g., setting industry standards. Thus, a
main difference between the two dependent variables is the first variable's focus on the monetary dimension, i.e.,
licensing revenues, whereas the second variable, i.e., success relative to competitors, takes into account strategic
issues in addition to the monetary dimension. The relative performance construct shows that companies which are
successful in commercializing technology assets from a monetary perspective tend to successfully realize the strategic
opportunities and vice-versa. The relatively high correlation between the dependent variables of .46 (p b .001)
highlights the importance of the monetary dimension when comparing external technology exploitation between
firms. At the same time, it demonstrates the importance of strategic aspects because otherwise the correlation would
have been still higher. Thus, there is a substantial difference between realizing revenues and outperforming
competitors.

4.2.3. Control variables
Five sets of control variables have been taken into account. The first two variables, i.e., revenues and R&D intensity,
have been considered to control for a firm's technology commercialization potential, which may affect performance.
Therefore, we included a firm's annual revenues in billion EUR as a measure of firm size. R&D intensity, i.e., the
percentage of R&D expenditures/sales, has been included as another control to reflect the size of a firm's technology
portfolio. We additionally considered the firm's number of patent families. As the correlation coefficient between this
variable and a firm's revenues is strong and highly significant, we did not include it in the models reported below.
Further analyses with this additional variable show no significant changes in the findings. Moreover, we have
controlled for a firm's prior experience with externally leveraging technology, which may positively influence
performance independent of a firm's processes. In addition, it may positively affect the process variables. Therefore,
we followed prior measures of experience, e.g., alliance experience (Rothaermel and Deeds, 2006), and measured the
time in years for which the companies have actively commercialized technology assets.
As a result of our cross-industry approach, we also controlled for any industry effects on the relationships
investigated. Based on prior works (e.g., Teece, 1998; Arora et al., 2001), which reported considerably different
motives for commercializing technology assets in these industries, we grouped the companies into the following four
classes: automotive/machinery, chemicals/pharmaceuticals, semiconductors/electronics, and other. For the first three
classes, we included a dummy variable (1 = pertaining to this industry; 0 = not pertaining to this industry) in our
analyses. The same method was applied to the firms' country of origin with controls for Austria and Switzerland in the
OLS analyses. However, we could not include dummy variables for both countries in the ordered logit analyses. Due to
the limited number of firms from these countries, the ordered logit analyses failed to converge (Long, 2002). Therefore,
these categories were combined into one dummy variable (1 = headquarters in one of these countries; 0 = headquarters
not in these countries).
4.3. Analytical procedures
Despite carrying out exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the correlations between some of the
independent variables are relatively high. Accordingly, we calculated the variance inflation factor to check for potential
multicollinearity. The highest value across all models and variables refers to ‘control process' in model 6 and amounts
to 1.87. This value is well within an acceptable range (Hair et al., 2006). Thus, the correlations are not sufficiently high
to lead to a substantial increase in the variance inflation factor. However, the relatively high correlations lead to the

situation that the variable with the strongest impact becomes significant in the regression analyses, whereas some
others remain insignificant.
As the licensing revenues were measured on an ordinal scale, we could not use OLS regressions in the analyses with
this variable. Since OLS analyses can provide misleading results in this case, we applied ordered logit analyses (Long,
2002). For the second performance variable, i.e., success relative to competitors, we used linear OLS regression
models. Despite the ‘quasi-objective’ measure ‘licensing revenues’ as one indicator of performance, we cannot fully

rule out the existence of a common method bias because the same key informant per firm assessed independent and
dependent variables. Therefore, we analyzed the extent of a potential common method bias by applying the procedure
recommended by Lindell and Whitney (2001), which has been applied in other empirical studies (e.g., Jayachandran
et al., 2005). The results of this analysis suggest that our findings are not merely due to common method bias, but rather
are substantial (Lindell and Whitney, 2001).
5. Results
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and correlations. A considerable number of the companies have established
systematic external technology exploitation processes (mean of 3.03 on a 7-point scale). Furthermore, the data show
that the tasks in the negotiation and realization stages are carried out more professionally than the tasks in the planning,
identification and control stages. Moreover, the data show significantly positive correlations between prior experience
and nearly all process variables. The significant relationships remain if the partial correlations are calculated to take into
account the remaining control variables in the relation between prior experience and the process variables. This finding
provides support for the path-dependent nature of external technology exploitation processes. Firms with more
experience seem to have higher incentives to systematize and proficiently manage their external technology
exploitation processes. Only the efficiency of the realization stage is not positively related to prior experience. Firms
with considerable prior experience seem to focus on effectiveness rather than efficiency in the realization stage.
Concerning the performance impact of the process variables, model 1 only includes the five sets of controls, and it
shows significantly positive effects of firm size and prior experience on external technology exploitation revenues
(Table 2). In model 2, we find the expected positive impact of a systematic process. In model 3, the proficiency of the
tasks in the planning and intelligence stages is insignificantly related to performance, whereas the proficiency of the
negotiation processes has a moderately significant positive impact. While the effectiveness of realization processes is
insignificantly related to external technology exploitation revenues, efficiency has a significantly negative impact. The
proficiency of the control processes has a significantly positive effect.
In models 4–6, the relative success measure has been used to capture external technology exploitation performance
(Table 3). Again, we find significantly positive effects of firm size and prior experience. Model 5 shows a significantly

<-----Page 14----->U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

459

positive effect of a systematic process, which, however, disappears when introducing additional variables. While the
proficiency of the planning processes has a significantly positive effect, the impact of intelligence processes remains
insignificant. By contrast, the proficiency of the negotiation processes has a significantly positive effect. The
effectiveness and efficiency of the tasks in the realization stage do not have a significant effect, whereas the proficiency
of control processes is positively related to performance.
When comparing the results of models 1–3 and models 4–6, we find support for Hypothesis 1 because a
systematic process is positively related to performance. Hypothesis 2 on the positive effect of professional planning
processes receives partial support because it only has a significant effect on relative performance, which considers
strategic in addition to monetary issues. As the impact of intelligence processes has remained insignificant, we do not
find support for Hypothesis 3. By contrast, Hypothesis 4 on the positive effect of professional negotiation processes
is supported by the data. Hypotheses 5 and 6 on the positive impact of effectiveness and efficiency in the realization
stage do not receive support. The efficiency of realization processes even shows a significantly negative relationship
with monetary performance. Firms that focus on efficiency during the realization stage are obviously unable to
successfully appropriate their share of revenues. Finally, the proficiency of control processes has a significantly
positive effect on both performance variables, providing support for Hypothesis 7. In general, the process variables
explain a considerable amount of the variance in the performance variables beyond the variance explained by the
controls.
6. Discussion
This research has examined the performance impact of managing major stages of the external technology
exploitation process. Our findings provide support for distinguishing five process stages. The proficiency in managing
these process stages and the existence of a systematic process help explain the discrepancies between the success of
some pioneering firms and the problems of many others. As such, this study represents the first quantitative success
factor study into external technology exploitation which constitutes an important complement to success factor studies
into new product development. This is particularly important in the light of an increasing interest of academics and
managers in the successful commercialization of technology outside a firm's boundaries.
6.1. Theoretical implications
Following research into new product development (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995), we have distinguished the
systematization of the external technology exploitation process and the proficiency of managing the different process
stages. In line with the results on internal innovation (Ernst, 2002), the data have shown a positive influence of a
systematic process. Although the significance of the influence is reduced in the analysis of relative success, a
systematic process ceteris paribus promises enhanced performance in external technology exploitation, particularly
regarding licensing revenues. By contrast, professional planning only has a significantly positive impact on relative
performance, which considers strategic aspects, e.g., setting industry standards (Teece, 1998). As these technology
transactions tend to be less standardized than transactions aimed at generating licensing revenues, thorough planning is
essential (Lichtenthaler, 2005).
The insignificant influence of the intelligence stage may be explained by the relatively passive strategies that many
firms pursue despite the recent increase in external technology exploitation (Davis and Harrison, 2001; Lichtenthaler,
2005). Professional intelligence will not lead to strong performance differences if firms do not actively commercialize
technology assets. However, a major shift towards actively commercializing technology may be currently observed in
practice (Davis and Harrison, 2001; Kline, 2003). As a result, professional intelligence will likely gain importance
because the identification of technology commercialization opportunities constitutes a major managerial challenge
(Escher, 2003). Moreover, the data have shown a high importance of the negotiation stage, supporting prior research
into alliances (Contractor, 1985; Avadikyan et al., 2001). Although negotiation is often not regarded as a critical stage
(Escher, 2003), firms may enhance their performance by developing negotiation capabilities to realize their own
objectives more successfully than their counterpart. In particular, the negotiation stage may substantially contribute to a
firm's success in appropriating its share of revenues from external technology commercialization (Sherry and Teece,
2004). However, it is inadequate to excessively focus on a firm's own position because usually the parties have to agree
on a compromise at the end of the negotiation stage (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Zaheer et al., 1998).

Furthermore, the results have shown that supporting the technology transfer based on effective realization processes
does not enhance performance. This result has major implications for research into technology transfer because it calls
into question traditional theoretical perspectives. Prior research into outward technology transfer has often focused on
the stage of actually transferring technology (Amesse and Cohendet, 2001; Martin and Salomon, 2003). As a result,
these works have relatively neglected the remaining stages. However, technology transfer performance seems to be
determined to a large degree by managerial activities that accompany the actual technology transfer, i.e., planning,
negotiation and control. Thus, the results may lead us to fundamentally rethink the managerial challenges of outward
technology transactions, which go considerably beyond the transfer stage. This result is supported by research into
partner-specific absorptive capacity, which has shown that the similarity of managerial mechanisms between the
technology source and the technology recipient positively affects performance (Lane et al., 2006).
In addition, we have found a negative correlation between the effectiveness and the efficiency of the realization
stage. Effectiveness and efficiency emerged from the factor analyses as two separate constructs, providing support for
our conceptual considerations. However, most firms seem to be unable to effectively support the technology transfer in
an efficient way. The negative correlation between these variables helps explain the surprising finding that the
efficiency of the realization stage negatively affects monetary performance, contradicting Hypothesis 6. This surprising
finding underlines the differences between external technology exploitation and internal innovation. Efficiency is
essential in internal innovation (Ernst, 2002), but it is less important in external technology exploitation. Accordingly,
firms should not excessively focus on efficiency during the realization stage which may limit their success in
appropriating revenues from outward technology transfer (Arora et al., 2001; Sherry and Teece, 2004). Firms with a lot
of experience in external technology exploitation have obviously recognized this challenge because prior experience is
positively related to effectiveness of the realization stage and proficiency of all other stages. However, it is
insignificantly related to efficiency of the realization stage.
Finally, a professional control of external technology exploitation positively influences performance. In particular, it
may help firms initiate experience-based learning processes, which considerably contribute to enhanced performance.
Further support for learning effects is provided by the positive relation of prior experience to nearly all process
variables which underlines the path-dependent nature of external technology exploitation processes. Outward
technology transfer has only increased in recent years (Davis and Harrison, 2001; Kline, 2003), but potential learning
effects have already led to visible results. Learning processes may be initiated by a thorough control of prior activities
and a subsequent optimization of the managerial processes. Over time, these path-dependent learning effects may
contribute to developing a dynamic capability of externally leveraging technology (Teece et al., 1997; Deeds and
DeCarolis, 2000). This dynamic capability may be considered an equivalent to absorptive capacity (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990; Lane et al., 2006) in outward technology transfer.
In general, the results have shown that numerous insights from research into internal innovation (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1995; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995) may be transferred to external technology exploitation. At the same
time, we have found major differences between internally and externally leveraging technology, e.g., the role of
intelligence and the role of efficiency in realizing technology transfer (Ernst, 2002; Frishammar and Hörte, 2005).
Thus, this research has deepened our understanding of realizing value from technology in open innovation systems
(Chesbrough, 2003; Laursen and Salter, 2006). As a firm's proficiency in managing external technology exploitation is
related to the boundaries of the firm, the findings provide support for competence-based approaches to organizational
boundaries. Accordingly, the results highlight the importance of nonefficiency perspectives in boundaries research
(Argote et al., 2003; Santos and Eisenhardt, 2005).
6.2. Managerial implications
The empirical findings allow for giving normative managerial recommendations. Firms should establish a
systematic external technology exploitation process, which needs to be communicated across a firm's distributed
knowledge bases (Brockhoff, 1991). This process should not be limited to individual technology transactions, but it
should consider all major tasks at the firm level. Besides a systematic process, firms should focus on the planning,
negotiation and control stages. Currently, most firms manage negotiation and realization more professionally than
planning, intelligence and control. Thus, the data point to managerial deficits in planning and intelligence, which are
considered the greatest challenges of successful external technology exploitation (Escher, 2003). The relatively
professional approach to negotiation and realization may be explained by the similarity of these tasks to external

<-----Page 16----->U. Lichtenthaler / Journal of Business Venturing 23 (2008) 445–464

461

technology acquisition. Furthermore, these tasks have to be carried out even if a company pursues a passive external
technology exploitation strategy (Rivette and Kline, 2000). According to a passive approach, which was pursued by
many firms in the past, firms are open to external inquiries, but they do not actively attempt to identify technology
commercialization opportunities (Chesbrough, 2003). Thus, firms may have realized learning effects in negotiation and
realization based on their experience in managing interfirm relations (Rothaermel and Deeds, 2006).
Accordingly, our findings suggest that companies and researchers alike should not oversimplify the realization of
technology commercialization opportunities by excessively focusing on a firm's strategic openness (Rivette and Kline,
2000; Davis and Harrison, 2001). The opportunities of open technology exploitation strategies will be limited if firms
lack a professional management of the critical stages of the external technology exploitation process. In the light of a
growing importance of outward technology transfer (Chesbrough, 2003; Kline, 2003), firms need to increasingly
address their external technology exploitation processes instead of focusing on their internal innovation processes. In
particular, small and medium-sized firms need a detailed understanding of outward technology transfer because they
may be forced to externally leverage technology due to limited complementary assets (Arora et al., 2001). The data
have shown that firm size is an essential advantage in external technology exploitation. However, a professional
management of the critical process stages constitutes a well-defined starting point for enhancing the performance of all
firms. High proficiency in managing these critical stages will help companies realize value from innovation and avoid
systematic mistakes in technology management.
6.3. Limitations and outlook
A few limitations of this study are worth noting. First, in the analyses of relative performance, common method bias
was possible. We have taken several measures to ensure that common method bias did not distort the empirical
analyses. Besides cross-validating the perceptual performance measure, i.e., success relative to competitors, with
objective data, i.e., external technology exploitation revenues, we have applied the procedures suggested by Lindell
and Whitney (2001) confirming that common method bias was not an issue. Second, the monetary success variable has
focused on a firm's revenues from licensing agreements and technology sales. Accordingly, we have not considered
external technology exploitation in alliances and other contractual forms, in which the impact of the process variables
may be equally strong. Third, the findings, particularly the descriptive results, reflect the current situation in the three
European countries included in this study.
Thus, it would be worthwhile to conduct a similar study in the US because managerial works point to the situation
that some US firms are ahead of European firms in actively commercializing technology (Rivette and Kline, 2000;
Davis and Harrison, 2001). Moreover, external technology exploitation may be studied in completely different
organizations, e.g., universities or research institutes. The finding that managerial activities which accompany the
actual technology transfer constitute a major success factor may provide new insights into the challenges of academic
technology transfer organizations (Phan et al., 2005; Powers and McDougall, 2006). In addition, the effects of
managing external technology exploitation may be considered in dyad-level analyses of technology transfer, which
have usually focused on the recipient of technology assets. As much remains to be explored, there are great
opportunities for further research into external technology exploitation.
