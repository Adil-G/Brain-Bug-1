<-----Page 1----->Abstract
An individual’s intent to pursue an entrepreneurial career can result from the work environment
and from personal factors. Drawing on the entrepreneurial intentions and the person-environment
(P-E) fit literatures, and applying a multilevel perspective, we examine why individuals intend to
leave their jobs to start business ventures. Findings, using a sample of 4192 IT professionals in
Singapore, suggest that work environments with an unfavorable innovation climate and/or lack
of technical excellence incentives influence entrepreneurial intentions, through low job
satisfaction. Moderating effects suggest that an individual’s innovation orientation strengthens
the work-environment to job-satisfaction relationship; self-efficacy strengthens the jobsatisfaction to entrepreneurial intentions relationship.

The presence of technology-based firms has long been associated with a nation’s
economic growth and prosperity. Many of these firms emerge when IT professionals leave their
organizations to start businesses. This paper examines why IT professionals intend to leave their
jobs to start business ventures. We focus on entrepreneurial intentions, since intentions toward a
purposive behavior can be crucial antecedents of that behavior. Understanding the factors
influencing entrepreneurial intentions is, thus, a central component of studying the new venture
creation process. Specifically, we examine how individual- and organizational-level factors (such
as individual innovation orientation, organizational innovative climate and technical excellence
incentives) interact to affect the level of job satisfaction experienced by IT professionals, which
in turn, impacts entrepreneurial intentions. The strength of the relationship between the level of
job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions, however, can be moderated by the individual’s
self-efficacy.
Our sample comprised 4192 IT professionals from IT user firms, vendor firms, and
government organizations. The results of this study indicate that individuals with high innovation
orientation—more so than their low innovation orientation counterparts—are negatively affected
(experience low job satisfaction) by a restrictive organizational innovative climate and poor
technical excellence incentives. Furthermore, contrary to existing studies that theorize direct
links between negative situational factors and entrepreneurial intentions, we found that the
mismatch between individual characteristics and poor organizational conditions is indirectly
linked to entrepreneurial intentions through low job satisfaction. Our findings also suggest that
self-efficacy strengthens the relationship between low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial
intentions. This finding suggests that employees who are confident of their job
2

<-----Page 3----->skills may be more motivated to leave their companies to start businesses if they experience low
job satisfaction.
We advance the research in understanding what motivates individuals to leave their jobs
to form new businesses. We employ the multilevel perspective, including the impact of low job
satisfaction and self-efficacy, while accounting for the misfit between the individual’s innovation
orientation and the organization’s innovative climate and technical excellence incentives. More
importantly we show that, while self-employment becomes desirable when there is a mismatch
between employee innovation orientation and characteristics of the organizations for which they
work, the progression from low job satisfaction to entrepreneurial intentions may depend on
feasibility perceptions, that is, self-efficacy. High self-efficacy employees may be more
confident about starting successful businesses; these employees may, therefore, be more apt to
leave their companies to start businesses if they experience low job satisfaction.
Our results also provide insights for organizational leaders and policymakers in managing
innovations and in cultivating entrepreneurship. Organizations valuing innovation can put
structures and incentives in place to cultivate an innovative climate to help prevent “brain drain”
and the consequences of having employees leave to set up new, potentially competitive ventures.
Alternatively, organization leaders can exploit the misfit between individual needs and
organizational characteristics by providing spin-off opportunities to tap into employees’ desires
for innovation. Employees who are not satisfied with their organizational practices can be
allowed to start spin-offs, and the parent organizations can support them with financial and
human resources. Policymakers can provide educational and training programs to employees
who are not satisfied with their jobs to raise their self-efficacy levels, hence strengthening their
confidence in pursuing entrepreneurship as an alternative career choice.

<-----Page 4----->2. Introduction
The presence of technology-based firms has long been associated with a nation’s
economic growth and prosperity (Rothwell & Zegveld, 1982). IT professionals who leave their
organizations to start businesses are a key source of these firms (Roberts, 1991; Romanelli &
Schoonhoven, 2001). This paper addresses the reasons IT professionals leave their jobs to start
business ventures. We focus on entrepreneurial intentions as crucial antecedents of that
purposive behavior (Ajzen, 1987; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Krueger, Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000).
Understanding the factors influencing entrepreneurial intentions is, thus, a central part of
studying the process of venture creation.
The research on entrepreneurial intentions examines the main factors: desirability
(perceptions of the personal appeal of starting a business) and feasibility (degree to which one
feels capable of doing so) (Krueger et al., 2000; Shapero & Sokol, 1982). Relative to the
desirability factor, we examine individual-level factors of innovation orientation, job satisfaction,
and self-efficacy together with organizational-level factors of innovative climate and technical
excellence incentives. We theorize that IT professionals are driven into entrepreneurship by low
job satisfaction (Brockhaus, 1980; Cromie & Hayes, 1991; Watson, Hogarth-Scott, & Wilson,
1998) caused by a mismatch between their innovation orientation and characteristics of the
organizations for which they work (innovation climate and technical excellence incentives).
We extend the entrepreneurial intentions literature by introducing a multilevel
perspective of individual and organizational factors influencing business creation intentions.
Proponents of multilevel research (Hitt, Beamish, Jackson, & Mathieu, 2007; Ireland & Webb,
2007), particularly in entrepreneurial research (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001), explain that to
understand entrepreneurial intentions, researchers must account for both organizational and

4

<-----Page 5----->individual factors. While studies indicate that organizational factors influence the job satisfaction
of technical employees (Mak & Sockel, 1999; Sankar et al., 1991), these studies offer little on
why these factors affect some individuals more than others. We provide a better understanding
by introducing the single characteristic, innovation orientation, as a moderating factor. We
theorize that the higher the employee’s desire for innovation, the stronger the influence of
restrictive innovative climate/poor technical excellence incentives on job satisfaction.
Regarding the feasibility factor, we advance entrepreneurial intentions research by
looking beyond the main effects of self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions (Krueger et al.,
2000; Shapero & Sokol, 1982). We theorize that self-efficacy strengthens the relationship
between low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions. High self-efficacy employees can be
more confident about starting successful businesses; these employees are, therefore, more apt to
leave their companies to start businesses if they experience low job satisfaction. Taken as a
whole, we include individual- and organizational- level influences on entrepreneurial intentions,
as well as the moderating effects of innovation orientation and self-efficacy on these
relationships. Figure 1 summarizes our conceptual model.
Insert Figure 1 about here
In the next section, we review the entrepreneurial intentions literature. We then use the
person-environment (P-E) fit theory to hypothesize the interactive effects of individual
innovation orientation and organizational innovation climate/technical excellence incentives on
job satisfaction. We explain the relationship between low job satisfaction and self-efficacy on
entrepreneurial intentions. We present the methods and the results. Finally, we discuss the
implications of the findings for organizational leaders and policy makers.

<-----Page 6----->3. Theoretical background and hypotheses
3.1. Entrepreneurial intentions
Entrepreneurship is defined as the process of organizational emergence (Gartner, Bird, &
Starr, 1992). Entrepreneurial intentions are crucial to this process, forming the first in a series of
actions to organizational founding (Bird, 1988). Moreover, intentions toward a behavior can be
strong indicators of that behavior (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).
Our understanding of entrepreneurial intentions is guided by two models: Ajzen’s (1991)
theory of planned behavior (TPB), and Shapero’s (1982) model of the entrepreneurial event
(SEE). TPB was developed to explain how individual attitudes towards an act, the subjective
norm, and perceived behavioral control are antecedents of intentions. The SEE model was
developed to understand entrepreneurial behavior. Entrepreneurial intentions are derived from
perceptions of desirability, feasibility, and a propensity to act upon opportunities. In this model,
perceived desirability is defined as the attractiveness of starting a business, perceived feasibility
as the degree to which an individual feels capable to do so, and propensity to act as the personal
disposition to act on one’s decisions.
Both the TPB and SEE models provide comparable interpretations of entrepreneurial
intentions (Krueger, 1993; Krueger et al., 2000). Krueger et al. demonstrated that attitudes and
subjective norms in the TPB model are conceptually related to perceived desirability in SEE;
while perceived behavioral control in TPB corresponds to perceived feasibility in the SEE model.
Essentially, perceived desirability and perceived feasibility are fundamental elements of
intentional behavior.
In this paper, we examine the impact of perceived desirability and perceived feasibility
on the IT professional’s intentions to start a business. Our research links the individual-level

6

<-----Page 7----->factors of innovation orientation, job satisfaction, and self-efficacy to the organizational-level
factors of innovative climate and technical excellence incentives. Specifically, we study the
central role job satisfaction plays in influencing IT professionals’ intent to become entrepreneurs,
accounting for organizational- and individual-level antecedents, and the moderating effects of
self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions.
3.2 P-E fit and job satisfaction
Studies have established that job satisfaction predicts entrepreneurial intentions
(Brockhaus, 1980; Eisenhauer, 1995; Watson et al., 1998). Much of the job satisfaction literature
posits that organizational climate determines job satisfaction (Agho, Mueller, & Price, 1993;
Welsch & LaVan, 1981). A supportive organizational climate is often represented by
management commitment, strong supervisory and peer support, and opportunities for innovation
(Niehoff et al., 1990; Yuki, 1989). Research findings indicate that support from one’s superior
and peers helps employees alleviate job stress and burnout, which may increase job satisfaction.
Such support may be particularly crucial in tasks where outcomes are uncertain, such as in
innovative work environments (Niehoff, Enz, & Grover, 1990; Yuki, 1989). Thus, in the context
of individuals who thrive at the front end of technology—for example, IT professionals— an
organizational climate supportive of innovation should lead to higher job satisfaction levels.
Another organizational factor, technical excellence incentives in the form of rewards, can
also lead to higher job satisfaction levels (Eisenberger & Rhoades, 2001). Organizational
incentives signal the organization’s goals and objectives. Poor incentives indicate a lack of
organizational support and can have significant detrimental effects on job satisfaction, since IT
employees value rewards as well as opportunities for continued training, learning, and
development (Coff, 1997; Mak & Sockel, 1999).

7

<-----Page 8----->While organizational factors, including innovative climate and incentives, should
influence the job satisfaction of IT professionals, existing studies offer little information on
which individuals are more likely than others to be affected by these organizational factors. We
use the P-E fit theory to connect organizational factors to individual factors. Specifically, we
introduce an individual’s desire for innovation, which we term as innovation orientation, as the
individual component of the P-E equation. Empirical evidence in the P-E fit domain suggests
that employees exposed to the same organizational environment may not develop similar job
satisfaction levels (Cable & Edwards, 2004; Kristof-Brown, Ryan, Zimmerman, & Johnson,
2005). Instead, job satisfaction results from the congruence between organizational
characteristics and individual needs (Cable & Edwards, 2004; Kristof-Brown, Ryan,
Zimmerman, & Johnson, 2005).
Specifically in this study, some individuals (IT professionals) are more innovationoriented than others. Thus, following the reasoning of the P-E fit theory, in an organization with
a restrictive climate for innovation and/or inadequate incentives, high innovation-orientation
individuals can experience lower job satisfaction levels compared to their low innovationorientation counterparts. This is because the needs of high innovation-orientation individuals are
best served by an organizational climate supportive of technological achievements. On the basis
of these considerations we hypothesize that:
H1a: The relationship between organizational climate for innovation and job satisfaction is
moderated by innovation orientation, such that the higher an individual's innovation
orientation, the stronger the relationship between the organizational climate for innovation and
job satisfaction.

8

<-----Page 9----->H1b: The relationship between technical excellence incentives and job satisfaction is moderated
by innovation orientation, such that the higher an individual's innovation orientation, the
stronger the relationship between technical excellence incentives and job satisfaction.
3.3 Low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions
Job satisfaction has been the subject of considerable interest in entrepreneurial research
(Brockhaus, 1980; Cromie & Hayes, 1991; Hisrich & Brush, 1986). Poor organizational
conditions can trigger low job satisfaction, which in turn can trigger the desire to start a business
venture.
Positive relationships between low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions are well
documented within the push theory of entrepreneurship. Frustrated employees are more likely to
consider entrepreneurship as an alternative career avenue (Brockhaus, 1980; Cromie & Hayes,
1991; Henley, 2007). For example, Eisenhauer (1995) reported that individuals are motivated to
start their own businesses if the satisfaction from wage employment is lower than the perceived
satisfaction possibly derived from self-employment. The push effects of low job satisfaction on
entrepreneurial intentions is particularly relevant among IT professionals, because these
individuals are often motivated by challenge and have high achievement needs (Couger, 1988).
As noted earlier in this paper, low job satisfaction can result from a mismatch between
the IT professional’s innovation orientation and organizational characteristics. In this instance,
the entrepreneurial option offers IT professionals the opportunity to realize their achievement
needs. Thus, low job satisfaction is a central component whereby unfavorable organizational
conditions for innovation are translated into entrepreneurial intentions. Therefore, we
hypothesize:

9

<-----Page 10----->H2a: Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between a restrictive organizational climate for
innovation and entrepreneurial intentions.
H2b: Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between inadequate technical excellence
incentives and entrepreneurial intentions.
3.4 The moderating role of self-efficacy
While low job satisfaction can motivate IT professionals to start a business,
entrepreneurial intentions can also be influenced by self-efficacy factors (Bandura, 1986; Chen,
Greene, & Crick, 1998). Self-efficacy is a person’s judgment of his/her ability to execute a
targeted behavior (Ajzen, 1987). Prior studies have identified self-efficacy as a key contributor to
entrepreneurial intentions, either directly or indirectly through influencing perceived feasibility
(Krueger, 1993; Krueger et al., 2000). However, the degree to which self-efficacy interacts with
perceived desirability to influence entrepreneurial intentions has not been considered.
In our study, self-efficacy is defined as an IT professional’s perceived competency in
performing a set of IT skills. Individuals tend to start businesses in areas linked to their job skills
and job related experiences (Shane, 2000; Wong, Lee, & Foo, 2008). The more confident IT
professionals are in their abilities to excel in IT-related tasks, the more likely they are to develop
entrepreneurial intentions when job satisfaction is low. Thus, we hypothesize:
H3: The relationship between low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions is moderated
by self-efficacy, such that the higher the individual's self-efficacy, the stronger the relationship
between low job satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions.

<-----Page 11----->4. Methods
4.1 Data Source
Data were obtained from two sources. The first source was the 1995 Singapore National
Computer Board survey of IT professionals. 1 A sampling frame of organizations that employ IT
professionals in Singapore was developed from Infocomm Development Authority (IDA)
Singapore. The frame was stratified by sectors such as vendors, end-users, and government
organizations. Invitations to participate in the survey were mailed to 9,527 IT professionals from
these sectors, resulting in a final sample of 4,192 usable questionnaires (1,299 from vendor
firms, 1,326 from IT user firms, and 1,567 from government organizations)—a response rate of
44%. Nonresponse bias was examined using one-way between group analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Respondents and nonrespondents did not differ in gender (F of 1.65, p = 0.84), age
(F of 1.24, p = 0.69), or IT sector (F of 0.97, p = 0.58).
The second data source, collected in July and August, 2008, comprised IT professionals
in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (the capital city of Malaysia). These individuals were recruited
through the first author’s personal contacts. This data collection included scales to assess the
convergent and discriminant validities of the study’s variables. Data were collected in two
countries to obtain a sufficient number of responses to assess the validity of our study’s
variables. As Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are global cities with multiracial populations, the
location should not affect the data. Of the 210 technical professionals invited, 172 responded to
the survey.
Respondents’ work experience in IT-related areas averaged 9.46 years, and the average
age was 33.25 years. Some 68% were males and a majority had bachelor’s degrees with incomes

Apart from a report that was submitted to the government agency that commissioned the survey, this study
represents one of the first attempts to analyze the survey data for research purposes.

11

<-----Page 12----->between S$30K and S$60K. Nonresponse bias was examined by comparing respondents (n =
172) with nonrespondents (n = 38). We found no significant differences for age (F = 0.53; p =
0.40), gender (F = 0.61; p = 0.47), IT sector (F = 0.85; p = 0.61), or location (F = 0.63; p = 0.49).
Respondents in the main dataset (n = 4,192) and the validity dataset (n = 172) were comparable
in age (F = 0.92; p = 0.83), gender (F = 1.01; p = 0.89), income (F = 0.67; p = 0.70), education (F
= 0.63; p = 0.49), and IT work experience (F = 0.93; p = 0.75). In the analyses, we combined
both data sources and included a year control. Based on the 4,364 usable responses (4,192 +
172), the respondents’ work experience in IT-related areas averaged 9.35 years, with an average
age of 34.69 years. Some 65% of the respondents were males; a majority had bachelor’s degrees
and incomes between S$30K and S$60K.
4.2 Measures
Table 1 presents the wordings and scale points of the key variables. Unless otherwise
indicated, all the constructs used a 5-point Likert scale response that ranged from strongly
disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). A summary of the measures used is outlined below.
Insert Table 1 about here
Entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial intentions were measured with a 2-item scale;
that is, “I have always wanted to work for myself (i.e., be self-employed),” and “If I have the
opportunity, I would start my own IT company” (α = 0.72). Existing studies have considered
Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.70 and above to be reliable. For example, Souitaris, Zerbinati, and
Al-Laham (2007) used six measurement items with reliabilities between 0.70-0.75 in their
analysis. Similarly, Knight (1997) reported reliability coefficients in the 0.70-0.90 range. Factor
analysis with reliability alphas of 0.70 or greater were retained in Phan, Butler, and Lee (1996).

12

<-----Page 13----->Furthermore, Nunnally (1978) considered the reliability criteria of 0.70 as satisfactory; our
entrepreneurial intentions measure (0.72), meets this criteria.
Studies maintain that intentions predict behaviors (Ajzen, 1991; Sheppard, Hartwick, &
Warshaw, 1988). Entrepreneurial intentions are assumed to predict, although imperfectly, an
individual’s choice to found his/her own firm (Davidsson, 1995). We randomly selected over
100 respondents 6 years after the baseline survey was conducted and asked them if they had
started their own businesses. We correlated the binary responses with the Likert responses of
their entrepreneurial intentions and found a positive correlation between entrepreneurial
intentions and business startup (Point Biserial correlation = 0.57; p < 0.05). Table 2 presents the
results of the validity study conducted to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the
measures developed in this study. Providing evidence of convergent validity, our measure
strongly correlated (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) with Kolvereid’s (1996) measure of entrepreneurial
intentions.
Insert Table 2 about here
Technical excellence incentives. We developed a 7-item scale to measure technical
excellence incentives. Examples of items are “My organization has a limited budget for IT skills
development,” (reverse-coded) and “Where I work, we are rewarded for technical competence”
(α = 0.80). The item “My organization has a limited budget for IT skills development” refers to
an incentive or reward for “skills development,” and not a monetary incentive or reward per se.
The factor analysis using principal component analysis and varimax rotation with the Kaiser
Normalization method revealed that all items loaded on a single factor. Our measure for
incentives for technical excellence was significantly related to Scott and Bruce’s (1994) “rewards
and resource supply for innovation” scale (r = 0.80; p < 0.01), providing support for convergent

13

<-----Page 14----->validity. Our incentives for technical excellence measure was not significantly related to Litwin
and Stringer’s (1968) general measure of organizational rewards (r = 0.12; p > 0.05), providing
support for discriminant validity.
Innovation climate. We used a 6-item scale to measure innovation climate. Examples of
items used are “My supervisor rarely solicits ideas from me to solve technical problems,”
(reverse-coded) and “Based on their experience, my peers often suggest new approaches to
solving technical problems.” The scale was reliable (α = 0.83) and all six items loaded on a
single factor. Our measure for innovation climate related significantly to Scott and Bruce’s
(1994) “organizational support for innovation” scale (r = 0.72; p < 0.01). However, our
innovation climate was not related to Dastmalchian’s (1986) general measure of organizational
climate scale (r = 0.12; p > 0.05). Both our measure and Scott and Bruce’s (1994) measure of
climate for innovation were significantly related to entrepreneurial intentions in the validity data
set, providing evidence of predictive validity for both measures. Dastmalchian’s (1986) general
measure of organizational climate was not significantly related to entrepreneurial intentions,
providing evidence of discriminant validity.
Job satisfaction. Three items adapted from the Michigan Organizational Assessment
Questionnaire (Seashore, Lawler, Mirvis, & Cammann, 1982) were averaged to create a measure
of job satisfaction (α = 0.85).
Innovation orientation. Innovation orientation was measured with a 6-item scale.
Examples of items used are “I often take risks in unfamiliar assignments,” “Where possible, I
take on technically difficult and challenging job assignments.” and “I am technically up-to-date”
(α = 0.81). When subjected to exploratory factor analysis, one factor solution emerged with an
eigenvalue greater than 1. Our measure of innovation orientation was significantly related to

14

<-----Page 15----->Farmer, Tierney and Kung-McIntyre’s (2003) measure of creativity (r = 0.72; p < 0.01), but not
significantly related to Jackson’s (1994) measure of risk taking (r = 0.12; p > 0.05), providing
evidence of convergent and discriminant validities.
Self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was measured using a task-specific scale. Respondents were
asked to rate their skills in a number of IT related areas (such as software development, database
design/administration, and development of multimedia applications along scales) where 1 =
None, 2 = Basic, 3 = Competent, 4 = Advanced, and 5 = Expert (α = 0.88). Researchers often
have to choose between general self-efficacy (GSE) and task-specific self-efficacy scales (for a
review see Chen, Gully, and Eden, 2001).
We used a task-specific self-efficacy scale because GSE may not predict domain-specific
behaviors (Eden and Granat-Flomin, 2000; Pajares, 1996). Within task-specific self-efficacy
scales, we developed a scale for IT-related tasks because of our sample (IT professionals).
Discriminant and convergent validity tests indicate that our IT-related self-efficacy scale
converges with Chen et al.’s (2001) measure of general self-efficacy (r = 0.80, p < 0.01) and not
with Chen et al.’s (1998) measure of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (r = 0.18; p > 0.05).
The convergence of our measure with the general measure of self-efficacy suggests that
our scale overcomes one criticism of task-specific self-efficacy scales, its lack of relation to GSE
(Zhao, Hills, & Seibert, 2005). The nonconvergence with ESE suggests that IT-related tasks are
significantly different from entrepreneurial tasks; hence, our IT task-specific efficacy scale may
be more suitable than ESE for our study of IT professionals. Table 3 summarizes the convergent
and divergent validities of the measures used.

15

<-----Page 16----->4.3 Control variables
Seven control variables (age, income, experience in IT-related work, opportunity
exposure, highest education attained, gender, and year) data were collected. Note that
opportunity exposure was operationalized as two dichotomous variables: a) IT sales and
marketing job function and IT research, and b) development job function.
We controlled for the respondent’s age in squared terms because of its influence on
career decisions. Age has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the probability of entering selfemployment (Alba-Ramirez, 1994; Bates, 1995). Initially, age incorporates the positive effect of
experience and increases the likelihood that people will start their own businesses. However, as
people age, their opportunity costs rise along with higher incomes, which decreases the
likelihood of self-employment. Consequently, we used income, which has been found to be
negatively related to entrepreneurial intentions (Long, 1982) as a proxy for opportunity cost.
We used the individual’s IT experience as a proxy for prior knowledge, which is a critical
antecedent of entrepreneurial decisions (Shane, 2000). Romanelli and Schoonhoven (2001)
found that individuals who are involved in marketing and sales are more likely to obtain firsthand information about market opportunities, and are, thus, more likely to develop intentions to
exploit these opportunities. Similarly, individuals’ knowledge about how new or existing
technology serves the needs of the market may motivate them to start businesses to address these
needs. Therefore, we controlled for the respondent’s exposure to IT sales, marketing, research,
and development work.
The literature also shows links between entrepreneurial intentions and educational
attainments (Crant, 1996). Highest education attained was operationalized as four ordinal
categories; postgraduate degree, undergraduate degree, diploma and technical degree, and below

16

<-----Page 17----->diploma and technical degree. Entrepreneurial intentions were often associated with gender
(Crant, 1996). Males were found to be more adventurous in experimenting with their careers,
while females were found to be constrained by family responsibilities and less likely to develop
entrepreneurial intentions. To assess if the findings were affected by the year the data were
collected, we controlled for year using a dichotomous variable (2008 =1).
4.4 Data Analysis
We analyzed the effects of P-E fit on the individual’s level of job satisfaction, as well as
the moderating effects of self-efficacy on the relationship between job satisfaction and
entrepreneurial intentions. The measures of P-E fit include the organizational innovation climate,
technical excellence incentives, and the individual’s innovation orientation. We used hierarchical
OLS regression to test the study’s hypotheses.

5. Results
5.1 Correlations
Table 4 presents the summary statistics and zero order correlations. The bivariate
relationships indicate that all the independent variables related significantly to entrepreneurial
intentions. As observed, the variable most highly related to entrepreneurial intentions was job
satisfaction (r = -0.32, p < 0.01), and although entrepreneurial intentions were also correlated to
other control variables, the associations were much weaker. In addition, the five independent
variables were not highly correlated to each other. Similarly, the independent variables including
innovation climate, technical excellence incentives, and innovation orientation were not
correlated to job satisfaction at the 1% level. The correlation coefficients among all other
variables were all below 0.60 (Kennedy, 1992) and none of the variance inflation factors (VIFs)
for the variables was greater than 2, which was below the guideline of 10 by Chatterjee and Price
17

<-----Page 18----->(1991). Thus, it was unlikely that multicollinearity among the independent variables affected the
findings.

5.2 Regressions
Table 5 shows the moderating impact of an individual’s innovation orientation on the
relationship between the organizational innovation climate and the level of job satisfaction
(Hypothesis 1a). The results also show the moderating impact of the individual’s innovation
orientation on the relationship between organizational technical excellence incentives and job
satisfaction (Hypothesis 1b). Table 4 presents the regression results on the mediating effects of
job satisfaction (Hypothesis 2a and 2b), and the moderating impact of self-efficacy on the job
satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions relationship (Hypothesis 3).
Insert Table 5 about here
Model 1 is a baseline model consisting of control variables. Results indicate that age had
a U-shaped relationship to job satisfaction. Initially, age decreases the likelihood of job
satisfaction, but job satisfaction is higher as age level increases (Rhodes, 1988). High income IT
professionals were more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and less likely to develop
entrepreneurial intentions. The control variable (year) was not significant (p > 0.10), suggesting
that the findings of our study were not affected by the year the data were collected. Furthermore,
the results provide corroborating evidence that individuals with higher education qualifications
have higher expectations regarding rewards, benefits, and organizational support, and thus are
less likely to be satisfied with their jobs (Lam, Zhang, & Baum 2001; Zhang, Lam, & Baum
1999) and more likely to have entrepreneurial intentions.

18

<-----Page 19----->Model 3 presents the results of the interactive effects between the organizational
innovation climate and innovation orientation, and between organizational technical excellence
incentives and innovation orientation on job satisfaction. Results show that these interactive
factors had significant negative impact on job satisfaction (-1.911, p < 0.01; -1.614, p < 0.001).
The pseudo R2 increased to 29% in Model 3 from 12% in Model 1. These findings support
Hypothesis 1a, which states that, the higher an individual’s innovation orientation, the stronger
the relationship between organizational climate for innovation and job satisfaction. The findings
also support Hypothesis 1b, which states that, the higher an individual’s innovation orientation,
the stronger the relationship between technical excellence incentives and job satisfaction.
The Sobel t-test (1982) provides additional support of the mediating effects of job
satisfaction (t = 2.263, p < 0.05). However, the Sobel test does not indicate whether partial or full
mediation has occurred. To test whether job satisfaction partially mediates the relationship
between a restrictive innovation climate and entrepreneurial intentions (Hypothesis 2a), and
between poor organizational technical excellence incentives and entrepreneurial intentions
(Hypothesis 2b), we followed the framework outlined by (Baron & Kenny, 1986). The results are
shown in Models 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. According to Baron and Kenny, full mediation occurs when
the following four conditions are met: (1) Independent variable/s must affect the mediator. In
Model 3, the impact of organizational innovation climate and technical excellence incentives on
job satisfaction was significant (2.145, p < 0.01; 1.743, p < 0.01). Similarly, the interactive
effects of organizational innovation climate and innovation orientation, as well as technical
excellence incentives and innovation orientation, were significant at 1% and 0.1%, respectively.
(2) The independent variable(s) must affect the dependent variable. In Model 5, organizational
innovation climate and technical excellence incentives had a significant relationship on

19

<-----Page 20----->entrepreneurial intentions (-1.145, p < 0.01; 1.209, p < 0.01). The interactive effects of
organizational innovative climate on innovation orientation, as well as technical excellence
incentives and innovation orientation were significant at 1%. (3) The mediator must affect the
dependent variable. The results in Model 6 highlight the negative effect of job satisfaction on
entrepreneurial intentions (-1.417; p < 0.01). (4) Lastly, if the independent variable(s) was not
significant in Model 8, full mediation effects were observed. On the other hand, if the
independent variables were significant, then there were partial mediation effects. The results in
Table 4 show that the independent variables were not significant, and that the four conditions
were fully met, thus providing support for Hypotheses 2a and 2b. Job satisfaction was found to
fully mediate the relationship between innovation climate/technical excellence incentives and
entrepreneurial intentions. The interactive effects between job satisfaction and self-efficacy (1.629; p < 0.001) provided support for Hypothesis 3, that the relationship between low job
satisfaction and entrepreneurial intentions is moderated by self-efficacy, such that the higher an
individual's self-efficacy, the stronger the relationship between low job satisfaction and
entrepreneurial intentions.
The interactive effects models, that is, Models 3 (r2 = 29%; p < 0.001), 7 (r2 = 25%; p <
0.001), and 8 (r2 = 34%; p < 0.001), explained a significant amount of variance over and above
the base model (Model 1, r2 = 12%; p < 0.001). The full model (Model 8) explained a significant
amount of the variance (r2 = 34%) over and above the main effects models, that is, Models 2 (r2 =
21%; p < 0.001), 4 (r2 = 6%; p < 0.001), and 6 (r2 = 15%; p < 0.001).

<-----Page 21----->6. Discussion
Results of this study indicate relationships among a set of individual- and organizationallevel factors contributing to IT professionals’ entrepreneurial intentions. Consistent with the P-E
fit arguments, we found support for Hypotheses 1a and 1b; that is, individual differences,
specifically innovation orientation, moderate the relationship between poor organizational
conditions and job satisfaction. Specifically, the higher the employee’s innovative orientation,
the stronger the negative effects of restrictive innovative climate/poor technical excellence
incentives on job satisfaction.
The support we found for Hypotheses 2a and 2b suggests that the effects of a misfit
between individual orientation and organizational conditions are indirectly linked to
entrepreneurial intentions through low job satisfaction. Such findings align with the desirability
arguments in the entrepreneurial intentions literature that intra- and extra-personal factors
interact to influence the personal attractiveness (i.e., the level of job satisfaction in this paper) of
starting a business.
Our findings supporting Hypothesis 3 indicate that self-efficacy not only influences
perceived feasibility, as the entrepreneurial intentions literature suggests, but it can also moderate
the relationship between perceived desirability and entrepreneurial intentions.

Individuals’

intentions to start their own businesses are likely to be boosted by the level of confidence they
have in their own competencies when they experience low job satisfaction due to a mismatch
between individual orientations and organizational environment.
6.1 Implications for research
This study extends the entrepreneurial intentions literature by introducing a multilevel
perspective in understanding the factors contributing to the intent to start a business. Individual
or organizational variables alone do not sufficiently explain the dynamic nature of

21

<-----Page 22----->entrepreneurial intentions (c.f. Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001). Rather, the interaction between
individual and organizational factors can provide better insights into the firm emergence process.
Furthermore, our study introduces the P-E fit perspective into the study of
entrepreneurship. While the usefulness of the P-E fit theory in explaining entrepreneurial
behavior is not entirely new (Brigham, Shepherd, & De Castro, 2007; Leung, Wong, Zhang, &
Foo, 2006), the nature of the relationship between individual and organizational factors—and
how this triggers entrepreneurial intentions—is still relatively unknown. Our findings indicate
that low job satisfaction is caused, in part, by the mismatch between the individual’s innovation
orientation and the organization’s innovative climate/ excellence incentives. Low job
satisfaction, in turn, may lead to entrepreneurial intentions, particularly among high self-efficacy
individuals. These findings demonstrate the mediating role of job satisfaction in translating the
effects of a restrictive innovative climate/and or poor excellence incentives on individuals with
high innovation orientation into entrepreneurial intentions. The findings build on and extend the
desirability arguments in the entrepreneurial intentions literature by taking into account the roles
of the individual and the environment in entrepreneurial intentions.
Previous research indicates the direct influences of negative situational factors on
entrepreneurial intentions (Shapero & Sokol, 1982). We expected low job satisfaction to partially
mediate the relationship between person-organization misfit and entrepreneurial intentions.
However, the results revealed that the effects of mismatch between an individual’s innovation
orientation and organizational innovative climate/ excellence incentives on entrepreneurial
intentions were fully mediated by low job satisfaction. For scholars, this implies that among the
displacement factors, low job satisfaction is a critical conceptual link to entrepreneurial
intentions.

22

<-----Page 23----->To date, models of entrepreneurial intentions have primarily focused on the main effects
of self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions (Krueger et al., 2000). We extend these models and
theorize that, in addition to its primary effects, self-efficacy also moderates the intention to start
a business venture. Our work contributes to the long-standing interest in the effects of selfefficacy on entrepreneurial intentions. Importantly, we found that, while individuals can be
driven into entrepreneurship by negative situational factors such as low job satisfaction
(Brockhaus, 1980), the strength of this relationship is stronger when self-efficacy is high.
Furthermore, our study builds on Shapero and Sokol’s (1982) intentions model. Rather than
considering perceived feasibility (i.e., self-efficacy) and perceived desirability (i.e., low job
satisfaction) as independent paths leading to entrepreneurial intentions, our study examines the
interaction between the factors along those paths.
Results from this study suggest that low job satisfaction alone is inadequate in explaining
entrepreneurial intentions. This probably explains why empirical evidence on the impact of low
job satisfaction on entrepreneurial intentions has been mixed (Schjoedt & Shaver, 2007).
Confidence in job competency provides the additional motivation necessary for employees who
experience poor job satisfaction to consider entrepreneurship as an alternative career choice.
Theoretically, our study offers a new perspective in the entrepreneurial intentions literature by
demonstrating how the interactive effects of desirability and feasibility influence entrepreneurial
intentions. Taken as a whole, the findings are consistent with Baron’s (2007) assertion that
individual-level factors predict the processes of new venture development. More critically, our
findings support arguments from Hmieleski and Baron (in press) and Phan, Wright, Ucbasaran,
and Tan (in press) that more multi-level research is needed in the field of entrepreneurship
research.

23

<-----Page 24----->6.2 Implications for practice
We investigated factors influencing IT professionals’ intent to leave their jobs and start
new ventures. Previous studies offer little information on which individuals, more so than others,
are affected by poor organizational conditions. We found that employees with stronger
innovation desires are more likely to experience low job satisfaction when faced with restrictive
innovative climates and/or poor technical excellence incentives. This finding has implications for
organizational leaders, particularly of technology-driven businesses. As the congruence between
individual needs and organizational characteristics may predict job satisfaction, innovatively
oriented organizations should recruit individuals with matching needs in their innovation
orientation. Having employees with characteristics that fit their organizations is crucial because
this synergy can significantly impact job satisfaction levels. Low job satisfaction, in turn, is a
central factor that translates misfit between individual characteristics and poor organizational
conditions into an employee’s desire to leave the organization.
Organizations valuing innovation can put structures and incentives in place to cultivate an
innovative climate to help prevent “brain drain” and the consequences of having employees
leave to set up new, potentially competitive ventures. Alternatively, organization leaders can
exploit the misfit between individual needs and organizational characteristics by providing spinoff opportunities to tap into employees’ desires for innovation. Employees who are not satisfied
with their organizational practices can be allowed to start spinoffs, and the parent organizations
can support them with financial and human resources.
The moderating role of self-efficacy in the entrepreneurship equation has implications for
policymakers in facilitating venture creation. Policymakers can target employees dissatisfied
with their jobs for educational and training programs to raise their self-efficacy levels.

24

<-----Page 25----->Entrepreneurial education programs can expose employees to the business environment, market
opportunities, and real-life entrepreneurship situations. This may strengthen their confidence in
pursuing entrepreneurship as an alternative career choice.
6.3 Limitations and future research
The findings of this study offer a number of opportunities for future research to advance
our knowledge of the individual and organizational factors that predict IT professionals’
intentions to start businesses. The present results showed that low job satisfaction fully mediates
the relationship between person-organization misfit and entrepreneurial intentions. The effect of
job satisfaction was the only mediator of the work environment-entrepreneurial intentions
relationship considered in our study. Other potential mediators may include, for example, work
motivation (Shane, Locke & Collins., 2003) and organizational commitment (Kickul & Zaper,
2000). In this study, we focus on the mediating role of job satisfaction because of its historical
association with entrepreneurial intentions (Brockhaus, 1980). Future research can consider other
mediators influencing the work-environment-entrepreneurial intentions relationship to gain a
more comprehensive understanding of why individuals leave their jobs to start business ventures.
Future research should consider different aspects of job satisfaction (e.g., satisfaction
with the work itself, remuneration, supervision, and co-workers) and how these influence
entrepreneurial intentions. To broaden our understanding of the interactional effects between
desirability perceptions and feasibility perceptions on entrepreneurial intentions, future studies
should also look beyond self-efficacy to consider other individual factors, such as risk-taking
propensity, locus of control, and degree of autonomy.
Additionally, further research of professions other than the IT sector is needed to validate
the generalizability of our study’s findings. Moreover, future studies could validate the

25

<-----Page 26----->perceptual measures with objective proxies. For example, “incentives for technical excellence”
could be correlated with proxy measures such as frequency of technical training, types and
quantity of rewards for technical excellence, and organizational budget for technical training and
education. It may also be useful to conduct longitudinal studies that track respondents as they
follow through their entrepreneurial intentions to actually start a business.
To conclude, findings from our study point to the need for future research to account for
multilevel factors, and to discover their direct, indirect, and moderating effects, thereby
enhancing our understanding of what leads individuals to an entrepreneurial career.
