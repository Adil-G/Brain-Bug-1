Abstract
Purpose – This paper considers ways forward in the study of trust in business relationships and networks.
Design/methodology/approach – The 25 papers focusing on trust previously published in the Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing are
categorized as to their focus and compared to the body of work on trust concluding there is little considering the nature of trust. A model that integrates
conceptualizations of the past and present and extends these to incorporate nature of trust as affective – including calculation and emotion – is
presented.
Findings – This broadened conceptualization of trust contains focused, interacting components enabling both holistic and well as focused study of
relationships and the role of trust within them.
Research limitations/implications – An important direction for business relationship and network research is consideration of the best way to
conceptualize and measure trust. The way that trust components combine and vary in different settings, including in different cultures is also needed in
future work. Operationalisations that are both more parsimonious and valid are likely.
Practical implications – Understanding as to value of measures of propensity to trust (which this model can guide) has potential value to managers
as does an effective measure of generalized trust and understanding as whether this is a first step in relationship trial.
Originality/value – This is first detailed model of the nature of trust in business relationships that has been published in the marketing literature.

business relationships (e.g. Svensson, 2004; Walter and
Ritter, 2003, in particular encapsulate this).
These JBIM papers reflect the literature within business
marketing that recognises trust as central to business
functions. In line with the main thrust of work in business
marketing the JBIM papers study different areas of trust, in
particular its link to performance, the factors that bring trust
about (e.g. Myhr and Spekman, 2005; Walter and Ritter,
2003) and occasionally on the functions trust fulfils within
which the normative implications of trusting, or not, are
considered (e.g. Rich, 2000, 2002). Yet despite widespread
recognition of the importance of trust, conceptualisation of
“trust” in business relationship literature remains limited. My
work has attempted to address this: exploring the nature and
role of trust and highlighting the need to develop
conceptualisations of trust that more comprehensively
consider its nature and varieties (Young, 1992, 1993, 1996,
2001; Young and Albaum, 2003; Young and Daniel, 2003).
Indirectly this has also emerged in my JBIM publications (in
particular in Young and Denize, 1995, which, while focussing
on commitment, considered the affectual nature of business
relationships).
This paper argues that despite the contributions of business
marketing researchers to date including those who have
published work in the JBIM, a deeper conceptualisation
focusing on trust and in particular on its nature would be of
considerable value in business and industrial marketing
settings. The essay sketches my model of trust which
emerges from theory not usually utilised by researchers of
trust in business marketing. Trust is conceptualised as an
evolving affect, that is, an interacting set of emotions and
assessments that develop and change over time. The essay
closes with a discussion of the value and future of an affectbased framework for studying trust.

About 20 years ago at my doctoral defence my committee
insisted I alter my topic from the nature and role of trust in
marketing channels to the nature and role of trust and
cooperation – as “there wasn’t a PhD in trust”. Undeterred I
immediately wrote my first trust paper (eventually published
as Young and Wilkinson, 1989), subsequently completed a
doctorate on trust and cooperation that focussed heavily on
trust, and have continued to do research into trust. During
these two decades the study of trust in business and industrial
marketing has experienced phenomenal growth, as has
recognition of trust’s importance.
The publications of the Journal of Business & Industrial
Marketing (JBIM) of the past 20 years reflect this growing
interest in trust. The first paper considering trust as
central[1] appeared in the journal in 1992 with three
further papers published in the next five years. In contrast
there were seven papers centrally concerned with trust
published in the JBIM from 1998 to 2001 and 14 papers
from 2002 to mid-2005. (Papers in the JBIM centrally
concerned with trust are listed in Appendix 1.) These 25
papers consider trust in a variety of business marketing
contexts including but not limited to e-business (e.g. DeeterSchmelz and Norman Kennedy, 2004; Myhr and Spekman,
2005) distribution (e.g. Bennett and Gabriel, 2001;
Hadjikhani and Thilenius, 2005) and international business
(e.g. Campbell, 1998; Li, 2003) with all focussed on trust in

An alternative conceptualisation of trust

(e.g. Bonoma, 1976) confidence (e.g. Morgan and Hunt,
1994), and security (e.g. Zand, 1978). But this is only implicit
recognition of the emotional content of trust. Emotions are
not directly considered much in business marketing writing. It
falls to writers discussing household decision-making,
purchasing based on brand relationships, response to
advertising and more recently in e-retailing contexts to
highlight the importance of emotions (e.g. Bagozzi et al.,
1999; Garbarino and Lee, 2003; Glaser, 1991; Jarvenpaa
et al., 2000).
Nor is the emotional nature of business relationship trust
reflected in operationalisations of it. It is measured directly
and/or is envisaged as cognitive (i.e. presuming that people
assess the characteristics of situations and calculate/decide
whether to trust or not) as is the case in the often-cited
Morgan and Hunt (1994) paper. There, trust is recognised as
affectual (i.e. containing feelings) but is measured directly and
in terms of factors that engender trust (e.g. using items such
as “In our relationship, my major supplier cannot be trusted
at times” and “In our relationship, my major supplier can be
counted on to do what’s right”). Even when trust scales have
items that include the word “feel” (e.g. IMP2 as reported by
Eriksson and Hallen, 1995, among others) they are not much
concerned with emotions in their conceptualisations. (See
Young, 1996, for further discussion of measurement
properties of trust scales.)
Yet, the number and range of emotions used to describe
trust in business relationships (as presented above) lend
credence to arguments that there are likely to be multiple
forms of trust and that these include emotional elements.
Therefore “trust” is envisaged here as varietal, with its
different forms including combinations of (differing)
emotions and calculations. While the (differing) nature of
calculations that will engender trust has been frequently
considered (starting with Deutsch, 1958, 1962), which
emotions come into play in producing varieties of trust and
how this process occurs has not been considered.
Figure 1 summarizes the components and relationships that
I argue constitute trust within business relationships. As
highlighted by the previous discussion, an important part of a
model of trust is its psychology. To address this, the ideas of
emotions theorists arguing for a complex emotional array with
an underlying structure (e.g. DeRivera, 1984) and the social
psychologists who recognise the interplay of motivation,
emotion and cognition in interpersonal relationships (e.g.
Argyle, 1991) are brought together. Emotions are
differentiated according to whether they function to allow
the building, sustaining and/or enjoying of relationships (in
line with Argyle’s (1991) theories of cooperative relationships)
with emotions of each type placed into the three functional
groups (based on De Rivera’s structural theory of emotions –
DeRivera, 1984). These different types of emotions interact
and combine with each other – as depicted by the arrows
leading from them to a circle that depicts the mingling of the
emotions. This combining of emotions is in line with
psychologists who argue that emotions do not stand alone.
They can be inevitably linked, as are delight and happiness, or
contingently linked, as are anger and shame (Smedslund,
1988). And it is argued that emotions can be compounded
(Millenson, 1967), yet can at the same time retain their
separate identity (Appley, 1990). (See Young, 2001, for
further discussion of emotions and the emotional factors of
trust.)

The importance of trust has been recognised for a long while
in the social sciences. The ability to trust enables humans to
interact in relationships and is thus essential for psychological
health (Asch, 1952; Barber, 1983; Erikson, 1959). Trust is
important in social exchanges including close personal ties
and also business and work relationships (Argyle, 1972; Blau,
1964, Kanter, 1977).
Building on work from the social sciences, business
literature has usually considered trust either in terms of the
conditions that engender trust and/or benefits that arise from
it. This results in single-dimension frameworks that
differentiate trust in terms of there being more or less of it
depending on the conditions and is reflected in much of the
most frequently-cited work in marketing on trust (e.g.
Ganeson, 1994; Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Zaltman and
Moorman, 1988). When varieties of trust are conceptualised,
there are a number of approaches taken. Some authors look at
different conditions that will engender trust (e.g. contracttrust, good will-trust, etc., as per Sako, 1997) or propose
quasi, uni-dimensional typologies, e.g. short- versus longterm trust (Meyerson et al., 1996) and fragile versus resilient
trust (Ring and Van de Ven, 1996), rather than considering
the essential nature of trust. The work that considers the
essence of trust often presents two varieties: one is cognitive,
calculative and rational; the other is emotional (Huemer,
1998; Lewis and Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995;
Williamson, 1993).
The roots of the more dominant, calculative view of trust is
in the early experimental psychology work of Deutsch (1958,
1962) and his colleagues who in their “Prisoner’s Dilemma”
work labelled as “trust” the calculated decision to cooperate.
Their focus on the costs, benefits and probability of defection
rather than the emotional or intuitive side of trust has
endured and is typified by cognitive orientation of authors
such as Doney and Cannon (1997). There is dispute,
however, as to whether this very cognitive trust is “real” trust.
Williamson (1993) argues that such manifestations of “trust”
are simply a calculation of costs and benefits and “real” trust
involves additional, relationally oriented attributes that have
no place in business. Others disagree and argue that this
deeper trust provides a greater depth and resilience that is
necessary in continuing relationships (e.g. Lewicki and
Bunker, 1996). This latter view is reflected in much of the
writing on trust in business marketing though without
focussing too much on what the nature of this deeper trust is.
It is my belief that emotions are central in effective human
functioning (Tomkins, 1970). They play important roles in
facilitating intuition and psychological and relational health
(Pinker, 1997) necessary for effective performance. It follows
that emotions will exist and indeed will play important roles in
business relationships. This is increasingly recognised in a
variety of contexts including the popular psychology and
management literature concerned with “emotional
intelligence” (initiated by Goleman, 1997).
Throughout the business marketing literature positive
emotions have been considered implicitly as components,
antecedents and outcomes of trust and sometimes have been
used as synonyms of trust. Trust has been described in terms
of feelings such as liking (e.g. Swan et al., 1985), admiration
(e.g. Childers and Ruekert, 1986), respect (e.g. Jackson,
1985), faith (e.g. Zaltman and Moorman, 1988), acceptance

As depicted in Figure 1, trust also includes the cognitive
elements of trust: the calculation of costs, benefits, and risks
associated with particular situations (Bagozzi et al., 1999), the
way that others who are recipients of trust are perceived
(Young and Wilkinson, 1989) – with competence and
motivation being the perceptions most central to the
development of trust (Butler, 1991; Heider, 1958; Lewis
and Weigert, 1985) – and the context, i.e. the assessment of
the overall state of the focal relationship (Wilkinson and
Young, 1994). Like emotions, these assessments interact and
combine to form an overall perception of a relationship.
Also, as Figure 1 indicates, emotions will influence
assessments and vice versa. If consistent, the emotions of
trust and the assessments of risk combine to form a trust that
contains a balanced mixture of emotion and cognition. If not
balanced/consistent, either discomfort with emotions being
experienced relative to the situation will generate a different
mix of emotions and/or reassessment of the relational
situation will occur (in line with theories of balance as
discussed by Heider, 1958) – as denoted by the two-way
arrows leading both in and out of the circles to the centre of
the trust box. A balancing of this type could result in a trust
with less positive emotions and/or a higher assessment of
riskiness (or a more intense and positive set of emotions and a
less risky assessment). This is in line with relationship and
network literature that argues that relationships exist in an
ever-changing atmosphere. Much of this work treats trust as
part of a relationship atmosphere (e.g. Eriksson and Hallen,
1995; Wiley et al., 2002) that is a rich combination of evolving
factors (see Wilkinson, 2006).
Figure 1 also considers the way that trust evolves within the
broader relationship. My previous work indicates that

affectual trust results in certain benefits and costs for a
relationship and those participating in it (Young and Albaum,
2003; Young and Daniel, 2003; Young and Wilkinson, 1997).
These in turn change the nature and context of the
relationship by changing the value placed on it, the
expectations of those involved and the conditions
surrounding the relationship. In other words, changed
relational conditions in turn create changed opportunities
for and propensities to trust (Young and Wilkinson, 1997).
Assessments of risk and of the recipient of trust may change
because the relationship context has changed and/or the
emotions may change because stimuli that will engender
emotions have changed.
Simple forms of trust enable people to approach each other
and gain the experience necessary for stronger emotions,
more sophisticated assessment and higher risk choices
(DeRivera, 1984; Young, 2001). Early stage emotions
include the relationship-building emotions of interest and
admiration with the likely associated cognitions concerned
with determining of level of competence, nature of motivation
and congruence of goals (Heider, 1958; Young, 2001). As the
relationship evaluation becomes richer (i.e. history is more
substantial and surrounding conditions better understood),
more complex, trust-associated emotions are likely to develop.
Trust can evolve from being an amalgam of simple,
exploratory emotions enabling the decisions to take lowlevel risks to something including emotions of the relationship
sustaining and enjoying types. Alternatively, early
disappointments may lead to decrease in relationship
building emotions of trust and movement to a cycle of
indifference or distrust.

Figure 1 indicates the inevitable diversity of trust. Not only
will the bases of trust that emerge from differing relational
histories, the relationship environment and the character of
the people and organisations in which trust will be placed be
different, the responses of those trusting will differ. So, there
are nearly as many types of trust as there are situations in
which trust is occurring. To get a handle on this diversity we
need to ascertain what the commonly occurring combinations
of trust aspects are, i.e. what are the “attractors” of trust
(Wilkinson and Young, 2002). In previous work (Young,
1996, 2001) I proposed a typology in which there are nine
basic types of trust that emerge according to what stage of
development a relationship is at: whether trust is based upon
perceptions of motivation or competence in the trusted other
and whether social or economic benefits are primarily sought.
Within each type of trust a somewhat different combination of
emotions and cognitions combine to form trust. These types
of trust present quite different operating environments for
business relationships – something that has not been
considered much to date.

there more value for relation management in alternatively or
additionally considering the experience of trust itself – its
character and/or the match of trust that occurs in a buyerseller relationship? And, if the experience of trust is
important, is knowledge of calculus and/or emotions
needed? My work shows the importance of both (e.g. Young
and Wilkinson, 1997); affects, including trust, are effective
predictors of the propensity to continue business-to-business
relationships (Young and Denize, 1995) and relationship
quality (Young and Wilkinson, 1997). Furthermore, scales
including emotions and assessments are psychometrically
robust (Young and Albaum, 2003).
Future work should investigate the way components of trust
combine. The interface of cognition and emotion has not
been well studied by psychologists, who tend to specialise in
one or the other area. Also needed is study of the evolution of
trust. The modelling tools that allow this to be done
quantitatively as well as in qualitatively-based, longitudinal
cases are emerging (Wilkinson, 2006; Wilkinson and Young,
2002). A shift towards consideration of propensity to trust
(i.e. contextual and personal factors’ role in assessing and
feeling) also has enormous potential value to managers. And,
an effective measure of generalised trust would have
considerable research value, enabling us to ascertain if
generalised trust has predictive validity, to see if this kind of
trust is an important first step in relationship trial by lowering
risk perception and to provide further evidence that it is
associated with more effective business relationships.
Finally, there is need for further work in on the impact of
cultural contexts upon trust to enable deeper interpretation of
results from studies exploring international business
relationships (e.g. Campbell, 1998; Claro and de Oliveira
Claro, 2004; Paswan and Young, 1999; Wiley et al., 2002).
The answer to the question of whether trust varies in different
cultures is likely to depend on how it is conceptualised. Is it a
universal as psychologists – particularly those focussing on
the study of emotions – might have us believe? Or is it more
attitudinal, which would lead to a conclusion that it is both
contextually derived and inherent? Or do we need to follow
the lead of sociologists and those studying culture and see
trust as entirely contextually derived and hence richly
heterogeneous? Insights into the nature of trust will lead to
more or less homogeneous frameworks and hence to more or
less comparable studies of trust.

Conclusions and further research
My own empirical work incorporates multi-dimensional trust
assessments (e.g. Wilkinson and Young, 1994; Young and
Wilkinson, 1997; Wilkinson et al., 1998) or multidimensional assessments and emotions (e.g. Young, 1996;
Young and Albaum, 2003; Young and Daniel, 2003) and
demonstrates the value of considering trust comprehensively
and in a way that includes emotions. These studies show a
remarkably consistent pattern – the cognitive and emotional
elements of trust both play an important role in functioning of
business relationships. Also indicated, particularly by the
qualitative and case work, is the evolution of the nature and
functions of trust (in particular Young and Daniel, 2003).
However, this approach to researching trust has not been
adapted by business researchers, and nor has any other
comprehensive
approach
to
conceptualising
and
operationalising trust emerged. Without such conceptual
extensions I must reluctantly conclude that trust research
reached something of a “dead end” some time ago. As it
stands, trust in business marketing relationships is researched
either by atemporal structural equation models that indicate
discrete variables including unidimensional trust and
unidirectional causation (with implied relational evolution)
or case study. Trust is usually a key part of such structural
equation models – along the lines of the findings of Morgan
and Hunt (1994) – and these relationships have proved to be
quite robust (Gundergan et al., 2004). But so what? This tells
us that trust is important and that it is linked to relational
performance, but reveals very little about why that is so.
Without such understanding, managing trust is impossible;
managers can only manage the antecedents of trust and hope
for the best. Nor, more surprisingly, has much of the case
study work around focussed on the different forms of trust
observed or experienced. Instead they seem to derive
meanings of trust from the operationalisations of trust in the
quantitative studies of business relationships.
An important future direction for business relationship and
network research is the exploration of trust within a
substantive framework that considers its nature. There is a
need to explicitly consider whether antecedents or outcomes
attitudes are better indicators of trust or if both are needed. Is
