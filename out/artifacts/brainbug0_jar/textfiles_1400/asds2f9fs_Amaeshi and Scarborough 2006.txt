Abstract:
Entrepreneurship involves discovery, evaluation and exploitation of entrepreneurial
opportunities and has been explored from different perspectives. In this paper we
examine the evaluation and investment in entrepreneurial opportunities from a trustbased perspective. The paper adopts a neo-institutional understanding of trust as a
routine product of a social system as well as an organising principle. Drawing from a
two year study of US and UK dealmakers in early-stage technology markets, we find
that specific trust-mediated mechanisms are introduced, represented, and assessed at
different deal-making stages. We conclude that ‘good’ ideas may fail to attract
investments if they fail to appropriately signal trustworthiness to investors in the
evaluation and investment process. By focusing on the process by which opportunities
are assessed, and invested in, this paper holds several implications for how
institutional, organization, and personal level trust mediate evaluation of and
investment in early stage technological innovations.

Introduction

Early stage investment decisions in new technology ventures are often fraught with
numerous uncertainties and challenges, ranging from coping with the transformative
instability of novel ideas to possible asymmetric information and opportunistic
behaviours characteristic of investors-entrepreneurs’ interactions in markets for ideas
(Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Gans and Stern, 2003; Shane and Cable, 2002).
Professional investors (e.g. venture capitalists, bankers, etc) have over the years earned
a healthy reputation for foraging successfully through the uncertainty presented by novel
ideas (Riquelme and Rickards, 1992; Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Baum and Silverman,
2004), and have created a huge industry around it through their ability to reap
entrepreneurial rents from such endeavours1. The literature is replete with attempts to
decode and codify this expertise (or better described as ‘gut feeling’!) in discerning
‘good’ investment opportunities (e.g. Hall and Hofer, 1993; Zopounidis, 1994;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Silva, 2004; Franke et al., forthcoming). Simply put, these
attempts are often aimed at answering the question: what do investors look for in early
stage technology markets? The literature in the main traces the success of professional

investors to their ability to make sense of the signals which investment opportunities (i.e.
ideas) generate in relation to three key dimensions of their potential: (1) market (2)
people and (3) technology signals2 (Roberts, 1991; Baum and Silverman, 2004). But
what is it about these three dimensions that give investors the confidence to make their
investments? What is the underlying common architecture upon which these multi-dollar
investment decisions are made? Answers to these questions may account for why only
very few innovative ideas survive the ‘valley of death’ (Stevens and Burley, 1997).
In this paper, we adopt a neo-institutionalist perspective of trust 3 and argue the case
that trust serves as a screening and selection mechanism in the investment process given
the level of efficiency and effectiveness required, and that investors do not simply invest
in market, people, or technology as mainly presented in the literature; but rather invest in
complex systems of trust proxied and perceived through people, markets and or
technologies. In other words, ideas that are not able to signal trustworthiness in the
process fail to attract investments. As such, ‘good’ ideas could as well miss out on
investment opportunities if they are unable to signal trustworthiness appropriately in
the investment decision making process.
The significance and timeliness of the paper derive from the fact that the role of trust in
investor-inventor interactions has been largely kept at the periphery and mainly
represented as the ‘chemistry’ (meeting of minds at the interpersonal level) between
investors and inventors in the literature (Shepherd, D.A., Zacharakis, A., 2001; Uzzi
and Gillepsie, 2002; de Clercq and Sapienza, 2006; Franke et al., forthcoming). While
this view holds some truth, it does not exhaust trust in its broadness but leaves room to
further explore the role of trust in economic transactions. Following the growing literature
on trust (Mollering, 2006; Nooteboom, 2002) it could be concluded that where trust is
referred to in transactions between investors and entrepreneurs it has in the main been
examined from the interpersonal and dyadic perspectives. For example, Uzzi (1999)
investigates how social embeddedness affects an organization’s acquisition and cost of
financial capital in middle-market banking. He finds that at the level of dyadic ties,
firms that embed their commercial transactions with their lender in social attachments
receive lower interest rates on loans. In their research studying biases in venture
capitalist’s decision making, Franke et al (forthcoming) find that venture capitalists
favour entrepreneurs that share some similarities with them (homophily). On the other
hand, the neo-institutionalist perspective of trust is often taken for granted or at best
underrepresented in the investor-entrepreneur discourse (Mollering, 2006; Beckert, 2005).
This taken-for-grantedness may conceal the explanatory power of the neoinstitutionalist trust perspective in relation to investor-entrepreneur transactions.
The neo-institutionalist perspective has the advantage of bringing a broad range of
actors into the trust discourse. It goes beyond the agentic duality of trustors and
trustees, often presented in the extant literature, to include structures in the form of
institutions and social contexts. In this regard, institutions become both sources and
objects of trust (Dasgupta, 1988). The neo-insitutionalist perspective also transcends
the deterministic inclinations propagated by earlier theorists (e.g. …) and recognises the
complementarity of agents and structures in social production and reproduction
(Giddens, 1984). By implication, therefore, trust is inherent in both agents and

The market component encompasses all the elements of the business environment (e.g. competition, regulation,
geography, etc). The people component refers to all the human elements including innovators, management
team, social networks, etc; while the technology component refers to the value proposed either in terms of
products and or services, and their protectability
3
This perspective stems from the institutional theory tradition reflecting the works of Powell and DiMaggio,
Georg Simmel, Lynne G. Zucker, and recently reinvigorated by such scholars as John Child, Christel Lane,
Reinhard Bachmann, Guido Mollering, and Jens Beckert

structures. While the structural dimension of trust has been highlighted (Zucker, 1986;
Bachmann and Lane, 19xx; Mollering, 2006; Nooteboom, 2002; Beckert, 2005), it has not
been accorded similar level of emphasis in interactions between investors and
entrepreneurs as agentic dimension of trust has been. In other words, the neo
institutionalist perspective helps to introduce the structural dimension of trust into the
entrepreneurship discourse (xxxx, 2006).
Drawing from a two year study of highly-experienced US and UK dealmakers in earlystage technology markets, we find that specific trust-mediated mechanisms are
introduced, represented, and assessed at different deal-making stages. Deal-making is,
therefore, constructed as the outcome of the interactions amongst perceived investors’
trust in the market, technology and people, respectively4. By focusing on the process by
which opportunities are assessed, and developed, we suggest a framework which could
hold several implications for how institutional, organization, and personal level trust
mediate evaluation and development strategies for early stage technological innovations.
In particular, we stress the importance of trust, as an exploitation mechanism, in
overcoming complex selection and appropriability environments. This way, we extend
the discourse on early stage investment decisions and technological entrepreneurship,
which appears to be under-explored in the broad literature on commercialisation and
new product development, as well as offer a complementary but socialised view of trust
as an appropriability mechanism.
In the next section we examine the nature of innovation markets and introduce trust as
an exploitation mechanism. In Section 3, we develop propositions from our research
sites, and in Section 4 we discuss the implications of our research.

Early stage technology (innovation) markets and investor-entrepreneur
interactions

Innovation markets have been represented in the literature by different names5 – ‘market
for ideas’ (Gans and Stern, 2003), ‘market for technologies’ (Arora et al., 2001),
‘knowledge markets’ (Guilhon, 2001), et cetera. Apparently these different names seem
to suggest some form of commoditization of intellectual assets to fit into the common
parlance of ‘normal’ markets. However, innovation markets, by their nature, do not yet
exist in the strict sense, and as such do not easily allow for “goods … (to be)…
calculated by calculative agencies whose encounters are organized and stabilized”
(Callon and Muniesa, 2005 p.1245). In this regard, Davis (2003) argues that:
An “innovation market” is not a product market. In an “innovation market” no one
buys or sells physica l products, like sh ips or shoes or sealing wax. Nor is it a service
market; in an “innovation market” no one buys or sells services, like those offered by
tinkers, ta ilors, soldiers, and spies. …rather, [it is a market in which] one prepares
to sell innovative products at some future time (p.679)

A classical example of an innovation market, then, would be the exchange between
innovators and investors in the early stages of scientific entrepreneurship. Although
4

These refer to the trust investors have in relation to the market (e.g. industry, presence or absence of
competition, imitation, appropriation regimes, etc), technology (e.g. technical ability of the technology to
deliver expected value) and people (e.g. management team, referrals, etc). It is an old question whether the term
‘trust’ applies only when at least two actors are involved (trustor and trustee) and some people speak of
confidence when the target is not an actor (Mollering, 2006). We thank Guido Mollering for drawing our
attention to this subtle distinction. However, in this paper, the meaning of trust and confidence could be used
interchangeably in this context.

<-----Page 4----->5
some studies have highlighted the important contributions actual market conditions (e.g.
nature of competition, consumers’ perceptions, geography, rate of returns, etc) make in
shaping appropriation strategies, how innovation markets operate seems to be underexplored (Karnoe, 2004).
Unlike late stage commercialization (exploitation), where return on investment is easily
visible and less ambiguous, early stage commercialization (exploration) is subject to
conditions of high uncertainty and ambiguity (Afuah, 1998; Garud and Van de Ven,
1992). These uncertainties and ambiguities arise from various risk factors, which may
include the instability and mutation of the idea itself – as it is transformed through
myriads of experimentations, interactions and mediations (Goldenberg et al., 2001;
Amabile et al., 2001; West, 2002); incomplete contractual obligations and temporal
remoteness of profits; (Garud and Van de Ven, 1992; Cable and Shane, 1997), inflexible
organisational routines/ practices (Hellstrom and Hellstrom, 2002; van Dijk and van
den Ende, 2002), inter-departmental (Carlile, 2002) and inter-professional (Bechky,
2003) boundaries, impermeability of social networks (Hsu, 2004; Powell et al., 1996;
Owen-Smith and Powell, 2004; Oliver and Liebenskind, 1997) and variability of social
contexts (Aram et al., 1992). Yet, investment decisions are made and deals sealed in
this early stage. In essence, these factors suggest that early stage commercialization
cannot be explained simply in terms of investors’ discovery and exploitation of
opportunities (Venkataraman, 1997; Eckhardt and Shane, 2003) that come their way. It
rather requires some form of trust in people (e.g. entrepreneurs), technology and market
(Beckert, 2005) to navigate through the uncertainty characteristic of this stage.
Like most high risk investment decisions, investing in early stage technology markets is
not a static discrete transaction. It is an emergent process often constrained by scarce
resources. As such, it requires prioritisation, high level of efficiency and economising of
resources (especially time, effort and money), which often results to high attrition rate of
ideas (Stevens and Burley, 1997). Riding and Orser (2000) highlighted the following key
stages in the investment decision making process:
a) deal origination: in which potential investment opportunities come to the attention of
investors
b) screening: in which the investor reaches an initial decision to further investigate the
investment opportunities (or not); this is not an in-depth assessment and is usually
quick as investors are constrained by limited resources (including time) and would
want to economise on them efficiently; it may involve a cursory glance at some
artefacts such as business plans, patent applications etc
c) evaluation: which involves a detailed analysis of the opportunity including
assessment of the concept, people and returns
d) due diligence: which is an extended phase of the evaluation step, if warranted, and
may include formal market suite studies, reference checks, consultation with third
parties, etc, and
e) negotiation: in which the investor and the entrepreneur iron out the framework for a
deal; the deal closes once the parameter are acceptable to both parties
However, one of the key challenges of commercialising in innovation markets is that
actors are much more prone to opportunistic behaviours especially where appropriation
regimes are weak, the innovation is either dependent on specialised or co-specialised
complementary assets, and the social bond amongst the actors is unstable (Teece, 1986).
While formal contracts might be preferred as a better alternative in such situations, they
are not usually suitable for knowledge markets given that these markets thrive on
experimentation and necessarily require trial and errors to enhance the quality of
innovation (Faems et al, 2005a, b). As such, formal contracts, alone, in knowledge

<-----Page 5----->6
markets are ineffective and could be counter productive. On the other hand, the
literature on social ties emphasises the importance of social capital (i.e. social obligation,
trust) created by these ties (especially strong ties) in mitigating opportunistic behaviours
in uncertain and ambiguous contexts (Blyler and Coff, 2003; Cable and Shane, 1997).
Given the joint efforts required from entrepreneurs and investors to progress investments
in early stage technology markets, and following the prisoners’ dilemma precepts, it is
expected that both parties would be better off if they acted in unison and minimised
opportunistic behaviours. Investors need “good ideas” (technologies) to invest in while
innovators need financial and relational resources to further transform their ideas (Cable
and Shane, 1997), since the “…(dis)advantages of an individual firm are often linked to
the (dis)advantages of the network of relationships in which the firm is embedded”
(Dyer and Singh, 1998:660). In addition to “good ideas” 6 entrepreneurs bring along tacit
knowledge, knowledge networks, and where available, private and institutional
reputation, which are not available in secondary markets (Williamson, 1997; Cable and
Shane, 1997). Our interest in this study is to understand how investors and inventors
navigate the ambiguous and uncertain conditions of the early stage technology markets.
Interest in both groups is not unconnected to the important roles they play in taking
ideas to market (Hsu, 2002, 2004).
Notwithstanding, over the years there seems to be a polemical tension in the literature in
relation to what informs investors’ investment decisions in new ventures. According to
Franke et al., (forthcoming), one school of makes an implicit assumption that the
predictive strength of investors’ evaluations is based on certain objective criteria with
occasional random errors, and the other rejects this assumption and argues that these
evaluations are mainly subjective with systematic biases. While these perspectives provide
useful insights7, independently, they are inherently contradictory in their positions
(Franke et al, forthcoming). We rather provide a complementary view and argue that
investors primarily invest in trust by exhibiting both a willingness to accept vulnerability
and acting as if all things were under control8 (Mollering, 2006). This leads to our second
interest, which is to understand the role of trust in the investment decision process. But
what is trust?
In the section below, we outline the trust-based framework which we have developed for
analysing our empirical data. This framework largely reflects the neo-institutionalist
perspective of trust. In our opinion, the neo-institutionalist trust perspective helps to
bring together the varied influences on investors’ investment decisions replete in the
extant literature.

Trust-based framework: A neo-institutionalist perspective

The concept of trust is experiencing a renaissance in various social science disciplines
(Beckert, 2005) and has been studied along several units and levels of analysis:
interpersonal (Rotter, 1971, 1980), intra-organisational (group/teams), interorganisational (Humphery, 2002) and at the societal levels. Lewicki and Bunker (1995)
suggest that the study of trust may be categorized based on how it is viewed: (a) those
focussing on ‘types of trust’ and (b) those focusing on ‘sources of trust’. The first group

The expression ‘good ideas’ is not used in any normative sense. We are rather using it figuratively in
place of investment opportunities
7

For instance, there have been some evaluation models developed based on the ‘objective’ school of thought
paradigm (see Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000 for details)
8

Acting as if all things are under control is essential to Mollering (2006)’s discussion of ‘leap of faith’

<-----Page 6----->7
tends to come from the rationalist and cognitivist perspectives (e.g. Garfinkel, 1963;
Rotter 1971, 1980; Williamson, 1985; Coleman, 1990; Rousseau et al., 1998) while the
latter is more structuralist and institutionalist (e.g. Blau 1964, 1968; Luhmann, 1979;
Granovetter, 1985; Zucker, 1986) in approach. However, central to most of these views
is the seeming association of trust to fidelity of expectations, risk mitigation, uncertainty
reduction and acceptance of vulnerability (Newell and Swan, 2000). As earlier stated
we would adopt a neo-instutionalist perspective of trust and argue the case that trust
serves as a screening and selection mechanism in the investment process given the level
of efficiency and effectiveness required, and that investors do not simply invest in
people, market, people, or technology as mainly presented in the literature; but rather
invest in complex systems of trust proxied and perceived through people, markets or
technologies.
One of the outstanding contributions to the institutionalist trust literature is Zucker
(1986). Building on previous works (e.g. Blau 1964; Luhmann, 1979; Giddens, 1984)
Zucker, in her seminal work, traced the production of trust to three main sources: (a)
process-based (b) characteristic-based and (c) institutional-based. Process-based trust
is produced through reciprocal or recurring interactions between individuals or
organisations. It operates on the principle that “…persons and firms make investments
in process-based trust by creating positive ‘reputations’ or name brands” (p.61). These
reputations in turn serve as ‘symbolic representation of past exchange history’ (p.62) to
signal trust in the present. Characteristic-based trust on the other hand is produced
through social similarities – for example, family background, gender or nationality. As
such, characteristic-based trust implies that “…the greater the number of social
similarities (dissimilarities), the more interactants assume that common background
expectations do (do not) exist, hence trust can (cannot) be relied upon” (Zucker 1986,
p.63). Finally, institutional-based trust is produced from formal mechanisms that are
not dependent on personal characteristics or on exchange history. They are rather
driven, as the name suggests, by societal institutions – i.e. expectations embedded in
societal norms and structures (e.g. the educational system, systems of innovation, legal
institutions, etc) and could be signalled through institutionalised professions (e.g.
medical doctors, lawyers, accountants) and intermediary mechanisms (e.g. bank
supervision of escrow accounts). As such, Zucker argues that institutional-based trust
“…is a commodity, albeit a social one …that at least some types of it are purchasable”
(e.g. the commoditisation of intellectual property rights, professional and financial
services).
Newell and Swan (2000) make an attempt to interpret Zucker’s ‘sources of trust’ from
the ‘type of trust’ perspective. Drawing from the extant literature on trust, Newell and
Swan suggested a three-fold typology of trust. The first is what they called ‘companion’
trust which refers to trust based on judgements of goodwill or personal friendships. It is
anchored on both moral and emotional foundations in which parties expect each other
to be open and honest. Given these characteristics and because companion trust
develops over time through repeated interactions, they likened it to Zucker’s processbased trust. The second in Newell and Swan’s typology which they associated to
Zucker’s characteristic-based trust is competence trust. According to them, ‘competence’
trust is based on perceptions of others’ ability (competence) to execute a task. This trust
is not necessarily dependent on interpersonal interactions but could be signalled through
contextual cues (e.g. the reputation of the institution a person works for or the status of
his/her professional group). Finally ‘commitment’ trust, which they likened to Zucker’s
institutional-based trust, “…is developed on the back of formal societal structures,
which therefore reduce the risk of trust and make it acceptable” (Newell and Swan,
2000:1296). It carries formal obligations and is usually expressed through contractual
agreements between parties. However, while Newell and Swan’s integration of the two
Page 7 of 22

<-----Page 7----->8
perspectives on trust provides some conceptual and analytical benefits (especially on
their introduction of companion and competence trust), it comes across as a simplistic
representation of Zucker (1986) and tends to miss out on the fundamental interactions
between the different ‘sources of trust’.
The institutionalist view of trust is directly linked to the structurationist (e.g. Giddens,
1964) multilayered perspective of trust – i.e. micro, meso and macro. In this regard, the
process-based and characteristic-based sources of trust represent the production of
trust at the micro-level, while institutional-based trust is the production of trust at the
macro-level. Emphasising on this distinction, Neu writes:
In contrast to process-based and character-based trust, institutional-based trust
depends less on the specif ics of the particular exchange and exchange participants.
Instead, trust mechanisms are embedded in institutional practices th a t themselves
are accepted as “socia l facts” and not often questioned. In other words, these
institutional trust-producing mechanisms and the institutional practices in which
they are embedded come to be largely taken-for-granted by the majority of t he
society’s participants (Neu, 1991, p.188)

Social networks and professional groups are classic examples of meso-level trust
structures (Coleman, 1990; Pixley, 1999). Trust in exchanges, therefore, is strengthened
by mutual interactions between micro, meso, and macro levels as represented in the
diagram below. It has already been stated that socio-economic exchanges are embedded
in some form of trust relations (Arrow, 1974) but the dynamics of these trust relations
are still ‘black-boxed’. The neo-institutionalist perspective of trust brings a different
understanding of trust and trustworthiness as properties of both agents and structures.
Agents draw from structures in making trust decisions and the outcomes of such
decisions either reinforces or reduces trustworthiness of structures. Luhman gives an
example where money notes are accepted because they carry with them some form of
codified trust inherent in the monetary artefact. This trust encourages the use of
monetary artefacts as trusted means of economic transactions. One of the characteristics
of weak institutions is the social distrust they exhibit, and Nooteboom (2005) claimed
that this distrust could account for the inefficiencies of such institutions as police
systems and socio-economic exchange mechanisms in most developing economies. It has
also been found that where institutional distrust exists, socio-economic exchanges are
driven, albeit sometimes inefficiently and at high transaction costs, through social
networks (meso level trust) (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003; Bandelj, 2002; DiMaggio and
Louch, 1998; Uzzi, 1997). In the absence of meso level, micro links to macro through a
semi-strong route. It is semi strong because this route is largely dependent on a microlevel trustor’s ability to decode the macro level trust in the specific transaction, as well
as the individual’s heuristics, calculativeness and goodwill, which could come prove
expensive in novel situations.

Given its multilayered nature, trust is also an organising principle that provides a frame
of reference that allows actors to conserve cognitive resources (Uzzi, 1997), and thereby
allows for economising on information processing and safeguarding of behaviours
(McEvily et al., 2003), which are essential in investors’ evaluation process. In this regard,
McEvily et al posit that trust makes decision making more efficient by simplifying the
acquisition and interpretation of information through structuring and mobilizing.
Structuring in this case refers to the development, maintenance, and modification of a
system of relative positions and links among actors situated in a social space. For
instance, two people who have little or no knowledge of each other can develop trust for
each other relatively quickly when they share trust in a common third party and thereby
create a new link. At the same time, a breach of trust can destroy an established link
and cause the social network to be reconfigured. On the other hand, mobilizing is the
process of converting resources into finalized activities performed by interdependent
actors. It requires economising to be efficient. For instance, “when knowledge is received
from a trusted source, the receiver is less likely to verify the knowledge for accuracy and
is more inclined to accept the knowledge at face value…. Without trust, receivers would
have to expend time and effort verifying the accuracy and validity of knowledge
received, rather than immediately using and refining the knowledge” (McEvily et al.,
2003:97).
In this paper, we explore how investors draw from these perspectives of trust in their
investment decisions. We also intend to explore how ‘good’ ideas could escape funding
opportunities because they fail to signal trust appropriately. As such, we would situate
the assessment and development of novel ideas (which are entrepreneurial activities) in
trust – as an organising principle mediated by the interpretation of trust as a routine
product of a social system.

Research Setting

This paper is informed by the outcome of the exploratory phase of a two year study on
the dynamics of networked innovation. The project, which focuses on commercialization
of innovation, is conducted by Warwick University (UK) and Boston University (USA),
and jointly funded by the Cambridge-MIT Institute (www.cambridge-mit.org) and the
UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The study focuses on venture
capitalists and commercialization of early stage technologies. The goal of the study is to
understand how different actors (e.g. scientific entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers,
technology transfer offices, etc) involved in the commercialization combine their
expertise despite possible constraints arising from professional boundaries. This is
founded on the understanding that the success of innovation projects depends on the
ability to bring together knowledge from a variety of different groups across the
innovation process (Carlile, 2002; Swan and Scarbrough, 2005). Very often, such
processes fail because the right knowledge is not available at the right time, due to
factors impeding its transfer. This study is designed to help identify the way in which
the knowledge networks created through contracting (e.g. licensing, joint venture activity)
can help to overcome these problems.
This research strategy is based on the recognition that knowledge transfer encompasses
a range of institutions, actors and interactions. The exploratory phase of the study was
meant to scope the study. Emphasis was placed on the economic exchanges between
two specific groups – a) capital providers (e.g. venture capitalists, business angels, and
corporate ventures) and b) inventors (e.g. entrepreneurs, SMEs, and university transfer
offices). Interest in both groups is not unconnected to the important roles these groups
play in taking ideas to market (Hsu, 2002, 2004). The depth and breath of innovation
created in the Silicon Valley, for instance, has been partly attributed to the level and
quality of human and material capital available to the Valley. Given the tacit nature of
the knowledge the research seeks to uncover, we adopted a qualitative approach using
both interviews and documentary analysis. Contacts were sought through websites of
various investment institutions, innovation networks, research institutes and academic
institutions. Interviewees were contacted through email and interviews scheduled based
on responses received. The researchers sent out more than 150 emails soliciting for
interviews and in all we conducted 60 semi-structured interviews (30 UK and 30 US).
The interview protocols were equally semi structured, given the exploratory nature of the
study; and the questions mainly centred on investors’ identification of opportunities,
their interactions with innovators, their assessment/evaluation processes and criteria,
and their experiences in managing asymmetry information between them and innovators.

Why are ‘good’ ideas not funded?: Evidence from Interview data

Our interview data confirm that investors are inundated with lots of ideas chasing for
limited funds and resources. Unfortunately, investors are constrained and therefore have
to literally ‘cherry pick’ ideas efficiently and effectively. It is estimated that the average
ratio of ideas to investments is 3000:1 (Stevens and Burley, 1997). While this estimate
may not apply in all cases, it implies that some good ideas may go unfunded. Why is
this, the case? The main theme of this paper is that investors invest in trust systems
perceived through people, market and technology signals as well as draw on trust as an
organizing principle in screening and evaluating ideas to invest in. In analysing our
interview data, therefore, we draw insights from the neo-institutionalist conception of
trust as routinely produced in a social system (Zucker, 1986) and the concept of trust
as an organizing principle (McEvily et al 2003).
5.1

System based trust and Investment decisions

As earlier stated, the notion of trust as a routine product of social systems draws from
Zucker, 1986’s novel description of trust as an outcome of: (a) reciprocal or recurring
interactions between individuals or organisations (i.e. process-based view), (b) social
similarities – for example, family background, gender or nationality (i.e. characteristicbased view) and (c) formal mechanisms of societal institutions – i.e. expectations
embedded in societal norms and structures (i.e. institutional-based view). These forms
of trust are both distinct and interactive. We find that investors emphasise each of these
different levels of trust as screening mechanisms at different stages of the investment
process. Since the institution-based trust is much more visible and cheaper, it is used
very early in the process. This ranges from concerns about protectability of the novel
idea (e.g. intellectual property and contract regimes), nature of market (e.g. competition,
national business systems) to source and ownership of intellectual property rights.
Therefore, we conclude that ideas that are not able to signal trust in one or more of these
areas of concern are very likely to be screened out. Commenting on the source and
ownership of intellectual property rights, one of the respondents said:
First of a ll, it's got to be free to be commercia lized. So, a lot of research th a t's
paid for by an industria l partner isn't free because the industria l partner wil l
take the research back itself. It's got to have some intellectual property
position...so, either a strong patent or the ability to file a strong patent or some
very strong know-how th at means th is is novel and specia l and different and
protectable. (VJ)

Another investor comments on the market trust signal:
Typica lly, there are two, three market tests th a t we have for va lidity of an
idea. Number one is ‘would anybody buy th is stuff?’ Tha t is when I find someone
who would pay some money, even if it is only a few thousand pounds. It is
diff icult to get through large corporations. Tha t is the first th ing: would anybody
buy th is th ing? Secondly, can you find a management team th at is credible out
there, or people who know what they are ta lk ing about in th at space, who would
say ‘yes, I’m excited and would like to join th is? Th is is exciting stuff.’ The th ird

th ing is can you raise some cash aga inst th is? So in pure financial terms, does it
stack up? (HW)

The meso-level trust is also used earlier in the process. This is mainly derived from social
networks and or professional groups. As previously stated, one of the main challenges
of investing in innovation markets is the uncertainty orchestrated by possible
opportunistic behaviours. In order to forestall opportunistic behaviour, most investors at
the very early stage rely on their social networks to screen out ideas. These networks
could be external or internal. An example of an external network is this comment from
one of the interviewees:
… if you know your markets well, you know what th i ngs... you know what a rea l
problem for them to dea l with is. And if you don't know what the real problems
are, then you ask, and th a t's one of the critical steps. Or you ask your
colleagues..., you would ring up your network acquaintances...as you said, tacit
knowledge...and say, 'yea h, he llo, Joe. we've got th is guy, and he's got th is, and
th is is particularly in your sector. is th is a real problem for you? if we could solve
X by doing Y, is th at va luable to you?' And so, then, if you discover the answer to
th a t question is, 'yes. wow! I'd pay anyth ing!' you know you're onto a winner. If
they say, 'well, actually, the way [inaudible] at the moment is like th is, and it's
a bit of a pa in, but frankly, if it was going to cost us a lot of time, effort, capit a l
equipment, training, whatever...if there's a huge barrier to adopting the new
technology...it might do it a bit quicker or a bit cheaper, but frankly, the cost is
going to be too h igh for us to make the switch,' then you th ink, 'probably let th a t
one go.' And tha t's kind of early-stage checking of the market before you go into it
in th at much depth-- is th a t [inaudible] valuable?-- in making the decisions
which ones you want to take forward to the next step (VJ).

“We only initiate discussions with entrepreneurs from people we know”
(EV)
Most investors (especially venture capitalists and business angels) rely on their
colleagues as internal networks. In such instances, they bounce off ideas with their
colleagues as soon as they come across an idea that signals trust. Most of the time, these
networks are informal. However, we also find out that some of these networks
(especially internal networks) are formalised. This is much more prevalent amongst
academic/research related investors (e.g. funds targeting specifically innovation from
universities and research institutes). These formalised networks are closely coupled that
good ideas that fall outside the network could be easily excluded from getting funds as
expressed below:
So, we don't do anyth ing tha t h asn't come through the university Technology
Transfer Department. They screen out the people who are frankly mad; they
screen out the th ings tha t are not eligible; they screen out th ings th at shouldn't be
formed into companies but maybe should just be licensed or sold, and they just do a
sort of general feasibility check around it, and our rela tionship now is very
much...they will phone up and say, 'we've got a project th a t looks like th is, and
it's sort of th is shape in a stage. Wh a t do you th ink?' And if we say, 'well, sounds
quite interesting,' then they' ll start working…. So, it is very unlikely th a t
someone could come from outside… (VJ)

These social networks are not necessarily physical entities. Some investors can as well
rely on information technology (especially the internet) as an informative source of
testing trust signals from novel ideas.

I th ink when you've been in business in the particular sectors for a long time, it's
very easy to know what's going to potentia lly be a global operation and wha t
isn't going to be quite so big--but stil l obviously may h ave very nice revenue
streams--and what's tota l rubbish. And quite often, we've h ad people come
through the door, and they've said, 'oh, I've got th i s great idea, th is fantastic,
bla h, bla h, bla h , bla h, bla h, bla h , bla h,' and you go and Google after they've
gone, and there's two or three people who are a lready producing it. And
sometimes, it rea lly is as bold and as bad as th a t. [comment: herein, Google is
interpreted as an electronic network] (BH)

We also find that meso-level trust mechanisms are employed in the early screening and
evaluation where institutional-based trust is weak and or less visible. One of the
interviewees (M&R) gave an example where in the process of investing in a foreign
country with weak institutions, they had to rely on networks they established with a
local firm in that foreign country in the screening and evaluation of the investment. This
is inline with similar observations made by Bruton and Ahlstrom (2003). Even in areas
where one would expect that outcomes are solely determined by macro-economic and
institutional variables, such as the directional flow of foreign direct investments (FDI),
Bandelj (2002) found that social networks contributed significantly to flow of foreign
direct investment. The study asserts that expatriates establish social networks, which
are heavily used to promote and facilitate investment opportunities in home countries
(p.430). The study also found out that agents of investment prefer FDI transactions
promoted by previously existing personal and business ties to transactions guaranteed
by formal institutional channels, which is consistent with the literature in economic
sociology on risk reduction in a broad range of economic exchanges (see DiMaggio &
Louch 1998; Ingram & Roberts 2000; Uzzi 1997). Continuing, Bandelj argues that
“…there is an emergent generalization that in conditions of high uncertainty, people
reduce risk not just by relying on institutional guarantees, but by channelling economic
transactions through previously existing social relations” (p.433). The emphasis on
Bandelj (2002) is neither diversionary nor arbitrary. It rather showcases the equal
potency of social networks in economic exchanges, which often appears to be taken for
granted in classical and neoclassical economic traditions.
5.2

Trust as an organizing principle and investment decisions

The idea of social networks as screening and evaluation mechanisms could as well be
glimpsed from the interpretation of trust as an organizing principle. Relying on their
networks, investors conserve their cognitive resources, economise on information
processing, safeguard behaviours and thus make decision making at this early stage
more efficient by simplifying the acquisition and interpretation of information (McEvily
et al., 2003).
“They know the business we are into and send us people when they know they f it
into our business model… and we listen to them when they come” (Liverpool)
“We only recommend to investors people we th ink th a t f it into the ir portfolios”
(M& R)

In other words, trust as a routine product of a social system builds on trust as an
organising principle but adds to it the hierarchical dimensions of trust (i.e. macro, meso,
micro). Herein, the investor draws from the different configurations of trust in foraging
through the uncertainties and ambiguities presented by the investment opportunities.

Page 13 of 22

<-----Page 13----->14
While macro and meso level trust, respectively, could be argued to create and or enhance
early stage investment decisions, they do not necessarily guarantee personal trust at the
micro level, where day to day business transactions take place. This personal trust is
different from both macro and meso level trust and comes with higher risks and costs,
although these risks are to some extent cushioned by the institution-based trust. While
macro and meso level trust are substitutable, micro-level trust is not. In their
interpretation of Zucker’s process-based trust, Newell and Swan (2000) divided it into
competence and character based trust. We find that given the cost of perceiving trust
signals at this level, and given that micro-level trust takes time to develop, it is used
later in the investment decision process than earlier. It is almost the last thing that seals
the deal. Commenting on this a respondent said:
The other th ings we look for...we've got to have th e scientist who's committed
and enthusiastic. If they see th is as just a way of getting more grant funding, we're
not going to take it further forward. So, the scientist h as got to be able to expla in
h is or her science clearly at any level...very h igh level for a non-scientist or in
deta il. They've got to want to commercia lize it, and they've got to have a bit of a
commercia l view about wha t's h appening in the market. We wouldn't see th a t
person as being the Ch ief Executive, but basically, we usually start with just one
scientist and one partner. So, if th a t scientist is not rea lly commercially-minded,
it's going to be a struggle [Comment: competence based trust]; … if we have to
work together for the next five years, it's good th a t we actually get on, wh ich
sounds silly, but it's actually pretty important. If a scientist and me hate each
other on sight, it's probably not going to work, [Comment: character based trust].
(VJ)

Commenting on a deal that went sour at the end because of micro-level trust, one of the
interviewees said:
… We weren’t comfortable doing business with them. They aren’t a partner;
th a t’s the point. They weren’t prepared to be a partner and th a t’s OK. We were
looking for a partner; they were looking to buy someth ing in. It was just a wrong
expectation. Neit her of those is wrong. There are th i ngs th at companies can do,
where they can buy in a new piece of equipment or they can find some new
ingredients and they improve the ir business. Good luck to them. Well done. But
we were looking for someone who could be a partner with us, and they weren’t it.
Other people are much more prepared to be a partner with us, or we found a way
th a t there is some value to both parties. (GH)

Funding of an idea is also dependent on the ability of the idea to signal appropriate
spatial configuration of trust. Relating to market pull vs. technology push spatial
configurations, one of the interviewees said:
“RR is not exactly new to new ventures in the sense th a t at the end of the 80s, we
h ad a little foray into new ventures and it was called Technica l Ventures. It was
set up as a separate little business, wh ich was very successful once it was purely
licensing th ings, and then it transformed itself into a big technology exercise,
dreaming up products th at were not yet required by the market. We learned from
th a t th a t one of the key drivers is th at we don’t invent th ings. We look for
market opportunities and then have a market pull, as opposed to technology
push” – HW (also QuinetiQ example can help)

Page 14 of 22

<-----Page 14----->15
But where do these results leave us? Does the neo-institutionalist perspective of trust
provide any insights to understanding how investment decisions in early stage
technology markers are made and why some ‘good’ ideas may not get funding?
6.

Discussion

In sum, the neo-institutionalist perspective argues that trust is at the core of all socioeconomic transactions – for instance, it could be trust in a product, price, quality, seller,
regulations, etc. The institutionalist view also argues that trust is multilayered (occurring
at micro, meso, and macro levels, respectively) and interactive (i.e. there are often
interactions amongst the different layers of trust in any economic transactions). From
our interview data, it is evident that trust in exchanges, therefore, is strengthened by
mutual interactions between micro, meso, and macro levels and without trust there are
no socio-economic transactions (Arrow, 1974). Since early stage technology markets
involve some joint transformability of ideas, this reflection of trust across levels is not a
one-off event. It is expected that trust at these different levels would be required at
different stages of the transformation process and used by investors efficiently too.
Micro level trust is costliest and requires time and devotion to build as its development
is “…is subject to time compression diseconomies because it cannot be developed
quickly, nor can it be bought or sold in the marketplace” (Dyer and Singh, 1998:672). On
the other hand, macro level trust is cheapest and the easiest to assess. We therefore
propose that: institutional-based trust will be used earlier in the investment process, and
micro-level trust (i.e. character and competence) will be allowed to evolve in the process;
and emphasised later on in the investment decision process. And ideas that are
consistent in signalling appropriate trust across these levels throughout the investment
decision process are much more likely to be funded.
While the multilayered institutionalist perspective of trust reinforces the necessity of
trust for virtually all forms of exchange (Arrow, 1974), trust as an organizing principle
captures the essence of the entrepreneurial practice characteristic of investors’
evalutations of opportunities (e.g. new ventures). Therefore, we propose that the
concept of trust as an organising principle will be very useful to investors in efficiently
sorting through the mass of ideas/opportunities that come their way in the very early
stages of their investment decision process – especially in the deal origination and
screening stages (Riding and Orser, 2000). Although McEvily et al argue that trust as an
organizing principle requires trustworthiness (micro-level trust) to be effective, we add a
temporal dimension to this combination of trust and trustworthiness by suggesting that
the micro-level component (i.e. trustworthiness) comes later on in the decision-making
process – especially in the negotiation phase of the Riding and Orser, typology.
The conventional view in the literature is that investors invest in markets, people and
technology. While not disputing this view, the core of our argument is that investors
invest in trust systems, instead. In other words, markets, people and technologies are
artificial proxies to assessing trust systems. These triads can be conceptually held as
different sub systems of trust existing in distinct trust spaces. Investors and inventors
are, therefore, in constant reconfiguration of these spaces to signal trust in the early stage
investment decision process. How these trust spaces are configured determines what
gets funded. In the conventional commercialization parlance, the spatial configuration
of markets and people (management team/entrepreneur) – i.e. where there is perceived
trust in market and people, respectively – gives rise to a ‘market pull’; while the spatial
configurations of people and technology, on one hand, and markets and technology, on
the other, give rise to ‘technology push’ and ‘entrepreneurial gap’, respectively (diagram
below). Therefore, we propose that: where an idea falls in the different spatial
configurations of trust will determine whether the idea is funded or not; and ideas that
Page 15 of 22

<-----Page 15----->16
fall in either the ‘market pull’ or entrepreneurial gap trust spaces will be funded while
those in ‘technology push’ space will not receive funding. We also recognise that early
stage technologies are emergent and non linear in advancement. As such, these spatial
configurations of trust are also iterative and dynamic. For instance, it is possible to keep
an idea with good market opportunities but without a good management team in the
investment loop, with hope that the entrepreneurial gap would be filled later on,
provided it also continues to signal appropriate levels of trust in the process.

amongst socio-economic actors at this micro level buffers the inevitable uncertainties in
’deal making’ (Kaghan and Lounsbury, 2004), which cannot be completely captured in
contracts anchored on the institution-based trust of appropriation regimes. And in
situations where weak appropriation regimes constrain knowledge markets, strong micro
level trust could under certain conditions (e.g. resource equality) serve as a governance
mechanism to enhance appropriability. In this line of thought, Shane and Cable (2002)
and Batjargal and Liu (2004), respectively, found that social networks, mediated by
micro level trust, have positive influence on entrepreneurs securing funding from
investors irrespective of trust at the macro level.
7.

Implications and conclusion

The level of funding available for early stage technology investments is significantly low
and arguments and debates on what drive investors decisions to invest in early stage
technologies are still tenuous. We have presented a complementary view to existing
literature from a trust perspective based on qualitative study of deal-making in the US
and UK. The main findings of our study are that investment decisions are to a large
extent dependent on the interactions between multilayers of trust (neo-institutionalist
view), on one hand, and spatial configurations of trust, on the other. As such, we hope
that the findings of the study will have implications for all involved in promotion of
early stage technology investments, especially investors, entrepreneurs and policy
makers. Firstly, there is a role for policy makers to foster strong institutions that give
investors the confidence to invest. This may be in form of policies in relation to
intellectual property rights, corporate governance, and sector specific investment
policies. On the part of entrepreneurs, they should learn to signal trust and position their
ideas in appropriate spatial configurations of trust. They should also strive to position
themselves in networks that could signal trust in their ideas, aware of the implications
these may have on their ability to secure funds for their innovations.
While social networks could be useful in socio-economic exchanges (Granovetter, 1985;
Uzzi, 1996; Zaheer, et al., 1998; Hite, 2005), they can as well be constraining and as
such should be used with cautions. Some studies on ‘star scientists’, for instance, have
also highlighted the significant relational capability these scientists bring to new
ventures, in particular (e.g. Zucker and Darby, 1996; Shane 2002, Shane and Cable,
2002; Murray, 2004). However, strong ties are much more likely to constrain the
efficiency of knowledge markets given their proneness to impermeability (Edelman et al.,

Page 17 of 22

<-----Page 17----->18
2004; Chakravorti, 2004) and social obligations. This impermeability shields the
network from new ideas and could lead to network redundancy. In addition, strong ties
carry with them social obligations of reciprocity (Swan et al., 2002; Edelman et al., 2004;
Sako, 1992), which may negatively impact on optimal decision making. In other words,
both entrepreneurs and investors need to be more careful in relying on strongly coupled
networks.
Finally, this study is not without limitations. The findings may be constrained by the
contexts (UK and US) and the qualitative approach may not encourage generalisability
(Yin and Campbell, 2003). We suggest that further research could be conducted with
different methods and contexts to enhance the findings of our study. For example,
ethnographic and longitudinal studies would provide alternative means of uncovering
the dynamics of investing decisions in novel situations.
