Abstract
When entrepreneurs launch new ventures, they must interact with a wide range of persons
who are not initially in their existing social network. In order to do so, entrepreneurs must develop effective working relationships with these individuals—and quickly! Accomplishing these
tasks requires a high level of social competence—the overall ability to get along well with other
persons. To date, only one study has specifically examined whether social competence influences
the success of new ventures (Baron & Markman, 2003). While these findings suggest that social
competence is indeed related to entrepreneurs’ success, this previous research had several notable
limitations. First, the measure of new venture success is limited in its scope and does not reflect
all aspects of new venture growth and success. Second, entrepreneurs from only two industries
were included in the sample. Third, no evidence on possible mediators of the impact of social
competence was obtained. Finally, all companies sampled were located in the North America,
thus leaving open, the question of whether similar results would be obtained in other cultures, too.
The present research is designed to address these deficiencies.

Principal Topic
When entrepreneurs launch new ventures, they must interact with a wide range of persons who are not
initially in their existing social network. In order to do so, entrepreneurs must develop effective working
relationships with these individuals—and quickly! Accomplishing these tasks requires a high level of
social competence—the overall ability to get along well with other persons. To date, only one study has
specifically examined whether social competence influences the success of new ventures (Baron &
Markman, 2003). While these findings suggest that social competence is indeed related to entrepreneurs’
success, this previous research had several notable limitations. First, the measure of new venture success
is limited in its scope and does not reflect all aspects of new venture growth and success. Second,
entrepreneurs from only two industries were included in the sample. Third, no evidence on possible
mediators of the impact of social competence was obtained. Finally, all companies sampled were located
in the North America, thus leaving open, the question of whether similar results would be obtained in
other cultures, too. The present research is designed to address these deficiencies.
Method
Data were collected from new ventures operating in a wide range of industries in two cities of China
(N = 146). Social competence was measured with a scale highly similar to that employed by Baron and
Markman (2003). More adequate measures of new venture success (e.g., growth in sales, profits, etc.)
were employed. Data pertaining to two potential mediators (knowledge and resource acquisition) and one
moderator (primary business focus) were also obtained.
Results and Implications
Results indicated that several aspects of entrepreneurs’ social skills are significantly related to the
financial performance of their new ventures. Further, such effects were mediated by the entrepreneurs’
effectiveness in obtaining information and essential human and financial resources. There was also some
indication that social skills exerted stronger effects on new venture performance in industries that required
entrepreneurs to interact with many different persons—and hence exercise their social skills—than in
industries that offered fewer opportunities to employ these skills. This research extended and refined
previous findings. Results suggest that efforts to enhance entrepreneurs’ social competence may well
provide them with skills useful in launching new ventures.
