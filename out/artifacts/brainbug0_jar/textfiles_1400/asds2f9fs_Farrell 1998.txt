EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This study of informal venture capital investors uses a completely different methodology than other studies
in an attempt to get a more representative and generalizeable view of the population of informal investors in
the Atlantic Region. Briefly, the methodology uses newly incorporated companies as the unit of analysis, a
random sample, and provincial weightings to generate an estimate of the amount of angel activity taking
place in the Region. This ‘grass roots’ approach is a more accurate indicator of the amount of angel
activity.
Data were generated from 328 persons and companies about their personal investment habits and the
contributions to firms by informal investors; 32.3 percent of the respondents were from Nova Scotia,
19.8 percent from New Brunswick, 25.3 percent from Prince Edward Island and 22.6 percent from
Newfoundland. A total of 35,766 companies were incorporated in the four Atlantic Region provinces in the
past five years.

Personal Reports of Investments
* Previous reports have identified a high incidence of entrepreneurship amongst informal investors. This
research reports a high incidence of informal investing amongst entrepreneurs.
* 20.2 percent of respondents who are largely entrepreneurs in the Atlantic Region economy indicated they
had invested their own money into a new or expanding business that was largely operated or managed by
some person other than themselves.
* In this sample alone, a total of 66 people made 95 informal investments in the past five years for a sum
total of $5,432,400; 56 percent took equity and another 28 percent took a combination of loan and equity.
* 34.9 percent of these personal reports of informal investments went to businesses that were started by a
family member.
* 17.9 percent of the informal investors indicated they had sold an investment. Few respondents indicated
the rate of return received on the sale of their investments.
* 36.8 percent of informal investors said that they lost the entire investment because the company went
bankrupt or voluntarily closed the operation.
* 9.2 percent of the sample’s informal investors are women.

Corporate Reports of Investments
* More than 75 percent of the respondents were the entrepreneurs for the company. Investors represented
9.6 percent of the respondents and lawyers represented 4 percent.
* Almost 20 percent of the companies incorporated within the past five years admit to not conducting
business anymore (19.6 percent).

<-----Page 6----->6

* Almost 15 percent (14.8 percent) of the companies had some form of informal investment. The number
of informal investors ranged from one to seven with a mean of 2.09 informal investors per company which
had informal investment capital.
* This sample alone had combined contributions of informal investment totalling more than $5,303,500. If
we agree that 35 percent of these investments are made by a family member, true informal investment in
these companies was likely in the range of $3,452,600.
* On average, informal investors are taking reasonably sized equity holdings in the companies in which
they invest (29.73 percent). Very few take majority positions.
* Female respondents have a greater proportion of angel participation in their firms.

Regional Estimate
* The estimate for Atlantic Region annual informal investment, calculated using the firm as the unit of
analysis, is $85 million. This is supported by a secondary method which produced an estimate in the
same magnitude and direction as expected..

INTRODUCTION
Informal venture capital investors have been classified as a subsector of venture capital. As early-stage
investors, they have been thought to occupy a prominent position in the advancement of entrepreneurial
ventures. As suppliers of seed, start-up and growth capital, informal investors promote the development of
new ventures with equity and ‘non-repayable’ loans following exhaustion of the amount of internal capital
the entrepreneur is prepared to contribute. The level of their activity in the Atlantic Region is a source of
interest to a variety of sectors of government.

The often asked question by policy makers regarding informal investors is “How much of a role do
informal investors really play in the start-up activities of new ventures?” The most often asked question by
entrepreneurs is “How do I find an informal investor?” Both these questions are worthy of considerate time
and expense to answer since they have significant financial implications for the economy in general and
individuals in the Region in particular.

The expense of developing good research often precludes its conduct. Researchers, mindful of the need to
write and publish, conduct their work with the limited resources available to them through shrinking
university departmental budgets. The existence of an agency and resource such as ACOA, to sponsor high
quality, labour intensive, research such as this study, is a credit to our Region. I would like to express my
gratitude for their interest in the nature of informal venture capital investors and their insight in enabling
this collaboration. I would also like to thank Saint Mary’s University and my Department for providing
relief from course work to allow such a collaboration to take place. My supervisors at the University of
Nottingham, Mike Wright and Ken Robbie, as usual are of invaluable assistance, guidance and support.

This report begins by summarising the research on informal venture capital investors and its findings. The
next section considers serious methodological concerns with current research and outlines the ways in
which this study seeks to remedy these concerns. The results follow with discussion and the report finishes
with considerations of recommendations.

REVIEW

Research has begun to focus on the angel investor and there have been many studies identifying their
demographics, return rates and investment patterns. Many of these studies have been conducted in Britain
and in the United States with some notable exceptions in Canada (Riding, Cin, Duxbury, Haines and
Safrata, 1993), Finland (Lumme, Mason and Suoni, 1996) and Sweden (Lundström, 1993). Informal
venture capital investors are generally male, middle-aged, of significant income generating households and
have greater than average wealth holdings. They have a variety of motives for investing in entrepreneurial
endeavours ranging from fun to looking for part time work. The many studies are not generalizeable and so
the range of characteristics which describe angel investors is growing.

The following charts summarize the span of angel demographics, investment characteristics and return
expectations which have been identified by other studies.

The wide variety of results which appear in these studies suggests that we have far to go in our
understanding of informal investors and/or the entrepreneurs in which they invest. Ages range from 42 to
64, incomes vary between £46,000 to $100,000 - $250,000, expectations of exit range from three to seven
years, and very few report poor expectations on investments. The variability in the manner in which the
data was collected also leaves much room for speculation about the methodological procedures used in
angel research.

Methodological problems exist because there is no known population of informal investors so most of these
works have been completed with convenience samples of investors. Convenience samples include the
snowball technique (asking a potential respondent if they know any other respondents) and judgement or
purposive samples (where the sample is selected based on some appropriate characteristic of the sample
members) (Sudman, 1976). Most of the angel research to date has been conducted with the use of nonprobability convenience samples including mailing lists of self-identified angels belonging to business angel
networks (Stevenson and Coveney, 1994), mailing lists of persons with high discretionary incomes such as
dentists, MBA graduates and subscribers to venture magazines in large urban areas (Harr, Starr and
MacMillan, 1988), and snowballing from formal venture capitalists and some known angels (Riding et al.,
1993).

With convenience samples, we are unable to generalise the results to the greater informal investment
population in general. The only thing we can say of the results of these studies is that they are limited to
the group of investors interviewed for the study. This is an extremely limiting position for researchers and
policy makers who may wish to employ the results in program development. Therefore, attempts to
quantify informal investors’ participation in the activities of new and growing enterprises have been
speculative at best. Translating speculations into economic policy is haphazard at best.

<-----Page 13----->13

METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS
The study of informal investors is inextricably entwined with the study of entrepreneurship because
entrepreneurial ventures are the most likely candidates for informal investments, and because there is a high
incidence of entrepreneurship amongst informal investors. Entrepreneurship is a young field of research
(Romano and Ratnatunga, 1996) and attention has begun to focus on theoretical and empirical
observations as well as methodological considerations regarding samples, questionnaires, methods,
statistical analyses, and length of investigation. This section considers methodological concerns regarding
entrepreneurship and its financiers. Some of the general problems are noted first and then we consider
sampling and systematic errors. The next section identifies how we have attempted to solve these issues for
the current study. The following discussion relates to methodological issues with regards to
entrepreneurship and informal venture capital investment.

Fundamentals for a New Paradigm

1. Sample Size and Breadth
There is a call for more broad based work than has been undertaken to date because fundamental
differences are being unearthed between the findings of small, specific and highly focused studies when
compared to the large, broadly-based studies (Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1987) particularly in areas related
to entrepreneurship. For example, when compared to more narrowly focused studies, a broad based sample
of entrepreneurs turned out to have: fewer foreign-born entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs with foreign-born
parents than the general population of foreign-borns; a generally smaller percentage of entrepreneurs who
came from entrepreneurial parenting homes than was previously suggested; more education than we had
believed (professionals aside) and certainly more than the average for the general population; and more
adaptability in organisational settings than we had previously thought. The implications of these findings
are equally important to the study of informal investors who are the financiers for entrepreneurs.

The call for broad based work is even more important if one wants to extrapolate their findings into
‘general principals’ for theory development or for areas that carry policy implications. “If the intent is to
make generalisations applicable to the economy as a whole, then samples should be broadly based”
(Cooper and Dunkelberg 1987, p. 21).

2. Field Work Versus Statistical Wizardry

<-----Page 14----->14

Financial theory is highly developed. Sometimes, researchers of informal venture capital investors attempt
to apply highly developed financial theories upon the newly developing area of informal investment.
However, the informal investors may resemble entrepreneurs more than they resemble the ‘corporate
return-maximising’ investor. The close relationship between ‘investing in’ angels and ‘starting’
entrepreneurs may make angels more ‘entrepreneur-like’ than ‘return-maximising-like.’ This is why field
work is important and attempts to apply highly develop financial theory to informal investors may be ill
advised.

Furthermore, some critics charge that current levels of statistical analysis are too sophisticated for the
study of a new paradigm such as entrepreneurship (Bygrave, 1989). They suggest that it is futile for an
infant paradigm to imitate the theoretical and empirical methods of an advanced paradigm’ ( p. 14). and
imply that entrepreneurship researchers are being ‘seduced’ by the accuracy and precision of complex
statistical tools. They say that entrepreneurship should be studied by intuitive, inspired, inductive logic. In
the rush to be seen as credible by other disciplines, entrepreneurship researchers apply statistical wizardry
to their data sets despite the lack of some basic elements such as random sampling. This problem is
exacerbated by sample frames which narrowly focus on convenience samples of informal investors.

Observing and recording behaviours has had large impacts on our understanding of managerial work
(Mintzberg, 1973) and may have similar results were it conducted similarly for entrepreneurs and informal
investors. New paradigms require substantial field research before we can apply the classic dissertation
format of developing hypotheses from propositions extended from theories based on field research. At this
stage of our interest in entrepreneurs and their angels, the emphasis should be on empirical observation
with exploratory or grounded research. The importance of field research and observation is necessary to
get back to the understanding that there is much to be learned in the on-going events and processes of
ordinary activity. “Too many young scientists have been inculcated with the belief that only ‘startling’
findings matter” (Bygrave, 1989, p. 21) thereby implying that the mundane daily tasks of field observation
are not spectacular enough to warrant credibility in publication or tenure considerations.

Sampling Errors

1. Sampling an Invisible Population

<-----Page 15----->15

The sampling method is essential to quantitative empiricism because of the types of sampling errors. While
inadequacies in the measurement process, called measurement errors, can be limited through attention to
particular details in the research process, sampling errors can only be reduced by attention to a randomly
selected probability sample (Lewis-Beck, 1994). The central limit theorem and the law of large numbers
permit sampling errors to be estimated only when the data have been collected by a random sampling
procedure. Confidence intervals, on which we put much reliance, will only take on real meaning when the
results are applied to properly sampled sets of data. While confidence intervals do not allow us to know
whether the results are exactly correct, they do allow us to estimate the probability that the results will be
inaccurate. We should endeavour to make confidence intervals as valid as possible by providing the
underlying grounding necessary for validity. There have been no stated confidence intervals for any angel
research because they have not been randomly sampled, until now.

Publication should include estimates of sample errors, but no statistical estimates of error can be computed
when the sample is selected non-randomly. For certain, errors will exist. If we were to admit the existence
of unspecified sample error in advance -- a kind of ‘lowered head’ in acknowledgement of a sample’s
faults -- we still cannot specify in which direction the errors lie (Lewis-Beck, 1994). When sampling
errors are unspecified, our assumption is that the error likely lies equally distributed around the mean. In
acknowledging that an error exists, the unspoken caveat is that the error probably lies equally distributed
around the mean. There is, however, nothing to suggest that that may be the case. The errors may all be in
one direction or, perhaps, in the other, or they may be about the mean, or they may not. Without a random
sample there is simply no way to know in what way the error may be skewed.

Random sampling becomes a problem when there is no known population from which to sample. There is
no known population for informal investors and Wetzel (1983) suggests it may be unknowable. Formal
venture capital firms are regularly listed and identified in guides such as Pratts Guide to Venture Capital
and industry associations such as the British Venture Capital Association and the Canadian Venture
Capital Association. A library or a telephone book can assist in identifying formal venture capital firms
easily. Entrepreneurs, however, report having a difficult time finding informal investors. Since angels are
considered to desire invisibility (Wetzel, 1983), there are no directories, lists or public sources of
information about them. This so-called invisibility has never been the subject of research. It has become a
universally accepted, but untested, norm that angels wish to remain hidden so they will not be deluged with

<-----Page 16----->16

business proposals by willing or would-be entrepreneurs (Harr, Starr and MacMillan, 1988)1.
Nevertheless, without lists, publications, associations or visible methods of finding them, developing
samples from populations is problematic when the population is unknown.

2. Success Biases
When looking at sample biases from the standpoint of the firm, there is another sampling concern which is
the tendency for methods of sample selection to bias samples towards successful entrepreneurs. This has
resulted because of a difficulty finding samples for very young companies. Because it is hard to find
reliable sources or lists of very young companies, a tendency to interview entrepreneurs who have been in
business a number of years (Aldrich, 1990; Busentiz and Murphy, 1996) has resulted. When very young
companies cannot be easily found, more established lists produce slightly older firms which, having
survived longer, results in weeding out less successful firms with time. This too is a systematic bias.

1

It is, as yet, an unsolved contradiction in the literature that angels want to protect their invisibility
(Wetzel, 1983), but generally express a desire to see more proposals and be exposed to more opportunities.

What was needed was a methodology that would accommodate for the four problems noted above: avoiding
success biases, random sampling without a known population, a broad based approach and attention to
fundamental detail. The answer was proposed at a conference in San Francisco at the 42nd World
Conference of the International Council on Small Business (Farrell, 1997). This methodology proposed to
find informal investors -- not by attempting to enumerate the individuals themselves -- but by finding them
throughout the cadre of newly incorporated companies. By working with the population of newly
incorporated companies, we would be able to identify the proportion of companies financed with informal
investment money via the instrument, not the source.

In this methodology, companies are sampled from the known number and population of new corporations
provided by the public registrations required. The individual companies are then asked about the capital
provided for the firm at and since start-up and about their individual investment activities as well. This is a
significant departure from normal sampling methodologies habitually used for studying informal investors.
Some angel samples have investigated specialised industries and attempted to identify the informal
investment capital therein. Where they specialise in an industry, we are not able to generalise their findings
to the economy or entrepreneurial foundings generally.

This methodology solves a number of problems, particularly that of a known population from which to
sample randomly. Other conditions were solved through the contributions of a variety of other factors.
The assistance for the research permitted a broad based study of new incorporations from the four Atlantic
provinces as opposed to a more limited local or provincial treatment. ACOA’s assistance also contributed
to the adherence to fundamentals and detail. Phone surveys receive far better response rates, and hence less
response error, than mail surveys. In addition, when respondents refuse to answer phone interviews, they
often cite reasons which are passed along by the telephone surveyors. These comments, while not
conclusive by nature, give us insight into the respondents’ reasons and future ways to collect and treat
information.

Using provincial, state or parish incorporation registrations serves as a source of new, young incorporated
companies for sampling (Farrell, 1997). Because it is more recent than Statistics Canada reports, Dunn

<-----Page 18----->18

and Bradstreet listings, business directories or phone books, it is a better source for new company surveys.
In fact, it turned out to be such a recent and good source of new companies, it was often difficult to find a
telephone number for the companies. This recency would eliminate or reduce success bias.

Organization of the Report

The results are organized into five sections. 1) In the next section, we consider the respondents to the
survey, the sample, and the representativeness of the non-respondents. 2) After that, the informal
investment activities of individuals are summed and projected. 3) This is followed by modifications to
investments based on interaction by family investments. Together, these two sections (2 and 3) give the
propensity for individuals to invest minus any interference by family investment activities. Using the
personal investment activities minus family interference is an estimation of the proportion of informal
investing which is attributed to non-family enterprises. 4) This is followed by an examination of the
amount of informal investment activity from the perspective of the firm. Here analysis is conducted by
asking information about the firm specifically. 5) Applying this proportion to the number of companies
which have informal investment capital in their structures gives us an estimate of the amount of true
informal venture capital investment in Atlantic Canadian companies. Using the weightings developed
earlier, we can estimate the amount of annual angel activity in the Atlantic Region. This is followed by
recommendations.

Charts, tables and figures are used liberally throughout the document. Using charts and tables in the
presentation provides more information to the reader which may not be commented upon in the text. The
surrounding information provides context and enlarges the contributions made by readers, thereby
promoting discussion.

SAMPLE RESULTS
Because of the all important nature of the process of random sampling in this research, we shall enumerate
and enlarge this section. The list of companies incorporated between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1997 was
provided by both the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. From these, a random list of numbers
from 0 to 100 was used to select companies from the list. The province of Prince Edward Island provided a
random sample of their database. In Newfoundland, the process was systematic random sampling. A
researcher hand-selected every 50th file. There is no reason to believe that the number 50 would have any
periodicity in these files. (Periodicity occurs when the list has a systematic pattern and the number selected
biases the sample).

Distribution of Atlantic Region Incorporations

Reports from the Registries for the four provinces show a total of 35,766 companies registered as
incorporated in the four provinces during the five year period from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1997. These
numbers are provided by the Registrars of the four provinces. The distribution of these incorporations is as
follows:

Sample Respondents and Attrition

The original random sample identified 1,408 companies and their directors/agents/lawyers, entrepreneurs or
investors. A large number of the sample identified could not be located by phone. A figure showing the
details of each sector of the sample follows this section as do the details of those not reached and the
conceptual concerns about their whereabouts.

A total of 444 persons were actually reached by telephone. Of this group, 328 agreed to be interviewed
and 116 declined giving us a response rate, based on companies reached, of 74 percent. These 328
represent 23.3 percent of the overall sample which included 490 phone numbers which could not be found.
The key indicator of response rate in this sample is the number of successful interviews compared to the
number of companies/persons who had an operating phone number. This proportion - 328 successful
interviews out of 840 potential respondents who had working phone numbers - represents a response rate of
39.0 percent which is very good. With a given population of approximately 35,766, these results are
sufficient to provide us with a confidence level of better than 95 percent.

These are important results, however, we must also conceptually consider the groups that were part of the
sample, yet who did not form part of the response. A more detailed account of each of these groups
follows:

1. The phone numbers were sourced using the Canada 411 (http://canada411.sympatico.ca) directory
available through the Internet. The phone number for each company was first sought via the business
listings. Surprisingly few were found with a business listing. In a large number of cases (490) no phone
number could be found for the companies or individuals, or the phone number found was the wrong one.
The Registries have the company and officers phone numbers, but only PEI and some of Newfoundland’s
records actually included this information in their reports for our use. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
would not provide that information.

2. Of the phone numbers identified, some were wrong, the phone had been disconnected, or we were unable
to communicate with the person answering the phone.

3. Each person or company for whom a phone number was found was called at least three times varying
the times of day and night (morning, afternoon, evening, Saturday) to optimize the likelihood of reaching
someone at the other end. This method was an effort to reduce a systematic bias which may have arose
from persons whose business may not have placed them at the phone during normal business hours. There
were a large number of phone numbers that appeared to be working phone numbers, but no one ever
answered the phone.

4. In many cases, we reached the potential respondent who asked us to call at a better time, who said they
would call us back, or who indicated the respondent was not in. When we were able to reach these
individuals, the calls were converted into #5 or #6.

5. This group was successfully reached by telephone, but would not agree to be interviewed. A large
number of this group made reference to a bad partner, the company going out of business, or just not
conducting business anymore. The surveyors were trained to encourage them that their information was
still valuable, however a large number of non-respondents indicated some negativity about the
enterprise/venture and refused to answer the survey.

6. This group was successfully reached by telephone and agreed to complete the interview.

<-----Page 22-----><-----Page 23----->23

Non-Respondents

There were several categories of attrition in the sample. For a large number of companies, no business
phone number or personal phone number could be found. This is group #1 listed above. Under other
circumstances, we might say that this would appear to be a clear indication that activities may have ceased
or never begun operation. We cannot make that assumption with this sample, however, because so many of
the numbers were sourced via personal phone listings which are more likely to have higher rates of
unlisteds. We can only speculate on the whereabouts of these companies and individuals if no listings are
available. There are three possibilities:

a) The company never started business in which case we would not want to include them in the survey.

b) The company has gone out of business and the individual has left the area or has an unlisted personal
number (possibly because of financial difficulties associated with the bankruptcy or closing) in which case
we would have wanted to talk to them.

c) The company and director do not want listed phone numbers. There may be companies which avoid
paying the difference between a business listing and a personal listing, but one cannot expect that much
business will be conducted with a company that chooses to have an unlisted number as well as its director.
Personal phones are often unlisted, but one would not expect that anyone starting a successful business
would keep an unlisted personal and business phone.

It is possible that Canada411 does not have up-to-date listings. A contribution to solving the mystery of
the large number of unfound phone numbers would involve the telephone authorities of the four provinces.
Those companies which were identified by the sample, but whose phone numbers could not be found,
would be given to the phone authoritiess which have the best information on up-to-date phone listings. The
telephone companies would have the final authority to identify whether there were phones for these
companies or their directors.

It is also hard to rationalize group #4. These phone numbers were called repeatedly at different times of
the day, night and weekends. The lack of any response is puzzling. This may partially reflect new
telephones where the callers name and number is listed so strangers from unknown numbers are not
answered.

<-----Page 24----->24

Group #5 listed above are those phone numbers which were found and for which we were able to make
some kind of contact. This contact consisted of the person was not there, the person would call us, or we
were asked to call them back. In either case, we knew we had made contact with the person identified. In
some instances, when we followed up on these, we found the person was not identified with the company
and there was likely another listing for a person with the same name or initials.

Respondent Distribution by Province

Of the 328 respondents, 32.3 percent of the respondents who agreed to be interviewed were from
Nova Scotia, 19.8 percent were from New Brunswick, 25.3 percent were from Prince Edward Island and
22.6 percent were from Newfoundland. The following chart represents these percentages in absolute numbers.

Prince Edward Island represents a disproportionately large number of responses for three reasons. Firstly,
there were concerns about the small size of PEI’s contribution to the sample if the sample were constructed
proportionately (only 4 percent of new incorporations). In other words, if we constructed the sample with
only 4 percent contribution from PEI, we may have had a problem relying on provincial statistics for PEI
later. Therefore, we allowed PEI’s numbers to approximate those of the other provinces in the event that
provincial estimates might be calculated. Regional estimates will have to be weighted according to the
number of elements in each province in order to estimate total population means. Secondly, and probably
more importantly, the registry information provided by the Department of Provincial Affairs and Attorney
General of PEI included the phone numbers for the newly incorporated companies. Lastly, surveyors
indicated Prince Edward Islanders appeared to be very receptive and willing to be interviewed.

The distribution of the respondents (those who were reached and agreed to be interviewed) follows.

A statistical test for independence between sex and province suggests it is highly unlikely that the sex of the
respondents is independent of the province. While no causality is suggested here, there are clearly aspects
of industry and incorporation at work for women in Newfoundland. In a chi-square test of independence
the probability of achieving a test statistic of 23.44 is extremely improbable.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITY OF INDIVIDUALS
At this point, it seems wise to reiterate the important dual objective of the survey design. The survey was
designed to capture information about informal investment in two ways -- from individual persons and
about the company that was sampled from the Registries. Firstly, the survey captured information about
the individual’s activities by asking the agent or director for the firm about their personal investment
activities before making reference to any company. Since we knew that entrepreneurs have a history of
making informal investments in other people’s firms, and we were going to be speaking to a lot of
entrepreneurs, we would make this attempt first. It is also possible that the person responding to the survey
could have been the lawyer or an investor since they are listed as agents and directors in the registries as
well.

The second objective was to capture firm-specific information about the company specifically sampled
from the Registries. In the second instance, the respondent was asked to tell us about the capital structure
(as it related to informal investment) for the specific company noted. In other words, we would ask the
respondent to tell us about their personal investment activities firstly, and then ask them to tell us about
their involvement with company XYZ. Company XYZ was not mentioned until after the personal survey
was achieved.

Personal Investment Activity

Of the 328 respondents, 20.2 percent indicated they had invested their own money into a new or expanding
business that was largely operated or managed by some person other than themselves. This represents
66 people of the 327 responding to the question. This is a startlingly large number when one considers that
one-fifth of the entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers, and directors of firms have an investment profile which
includes informal investments2 in other peoples’ companies.

2

While this document makes reference to ‘angels’ and ‘informal venture capital investment,’ these terms
were never used in discussions with respondents. Instead, different types of investments were described.
This avoided problems whereby some people may not be familiar with the terms, or where there may have
been a lack of uniformity in defining them.

Number of Investments

It is clear that there is an abundance of informal venture capital financial-type transactions taking place in
Atlantic Canada. Sixty-four respondents (20.2 percent) divulged the number of informal investments they
had made. Of this group, almost 61 percent had made one investment in the past five years. Just short of
30 percent had made two investments and a whopping 9.4 percent indicated they had made three
investments. In fact, one respondent indicated he had made more than he could count quickly and we
included his count in the ‘three investments in the past 5 years category.

More than 95 investments were made by the 64 respondents to this question.

‘Withholding’ Caveat
Some respondents identified themselves as angels, but were not prepared to answer specific questions about
shares taken, dollars invested, or returns associated with sales. Despite this, we are encouraged because we
were able to at least classify them as informal investors before the sensitive information came about in the
interview. A large number of respondents agreed to be interviewed even though they did not divulge very
specific and personal information.

In a postal survey for example, individuals who did not want to divulge certain limited pieces of
information may have systematically selected themselves out of the survey believing that their participation
was less valuable if they would not answer all the questions. In this telephone survey method, however,
respondents do not know what questions are yet to come. The pattern of questions first identifies them as
an informal investor; then, if they choose not to answer some of the more detailed questions, we have still
captured the most important element. Furthermore, the surveyor encourages the individual to continue with
the interview even if the respondent does not feel comfortable answering some of the questions.

Absolute Number of Dollars Invested

The absolute dollar amount of money invested into entrepreneurial and growth-oriented ventures during the
period is at least $5,432,400. This represents a staggering sum from the rank and file of entrepreneurial
oriented individuals in the Atlantic Region.

Fifty-eight respondents gave us specific information about their first investment (out of a possible
66 persons who said they had invested at least once); 21 respondents gave us information about their second
investment and five individuals gave us information about their third investment. Where respondents were
sensitive about specific numbers we asked them to pick a range and then we used the average of the high
and low for the range they gave us.

The reported investments for the five-year period totalled $5,432,400. Investment size ranged from $1,000
to $500,000, an extremely wide variation. The sum of reported first-time investments totalled $4.332
million with a mean of $74,695. The total of second-time investments totalled $853,800 with a
substantially reduced mean of $40,657. The five reported third-time investments totalled $246,300 dollars
with a mean of $49,260.

If we were to use the means to extrapolate the sums for the missing respondent information for the eight
unreported first-time investments, the four missing second-time investments, and the one missing third-time
investment, our totals would increase by $597,560, $162,628, and $49,260 respectively. This estimate
increases our total for the sample for the five-year period by $809,448 to $6,241,848.

First Investment Size

The average for first investments looks quite high at $74,695 which might lead one to believe that it is
skewed by a couple of very large investments, but this is not the case. If we look at a distribution of the
investment size, there is actually a significant percentage of very large investments; 19 percent of
investments were equal to or greater than $100,000. The predominant range for first investment appears in
the $10,000 to $30,000 range; 45 percent of the investments are in this range.

The frequency distributions for second and third investments are predominantly weighted to the lower end
of the investment scale. Fifty-two percent of second investments are equal to or below $25,000, another
23.8 percent are up to and including $50,000, 19 percent are up to $100,000 and only one investment at
4.8 percent exceeds that.

It is important to note at this stage, that these figures are not what ‘so-called’ angels would invest if they
‘found a good project.’ The sums represent the dollars which were actually invested by a sample of
328 people who were involved in new-company start-ups within the Region in very recent history. These
investments are not in their own companies.

Terms of the Investment

The lion’s share of the holdings in return for the investment were in the form of equity. At least 84 percent
of the informal investors took some amount of equity; 56 percent took all equity and another 28 percent
took a combination of loan and equity. The remaining 15.8 percent took loans. A number of angels were
reluctant to tell us what terms they came to in their agreements with their entrepreneurs.

Investments Sold and Rate of Return Achieved

When enquired about selling informal investments, 17.9 percent of the informal investors indicated they had
sold an investment. When questioned about the return on their investment sold, all but three refused to
indicate what returns were achieved in any specific way. Those who did reply ranged from 20 percent to
50 percent returns. Some respondents said the return was ‘pretty good.’ There was no indication given as
to whether they were calculated to annual rates or if they were overall returns over a period of years.

The curious aspect of the information on returns is the lack of any real detail in the respondents’ ability to
report information. There are three possibilities as to why this might be the case: either the return was very
good and they did not want to say, or the return was very bad and they did not want to say, or they did not
know. Regarding the first two possibilities, respondents’ did not seem hesitant to tell us ‘good’ or ‘bad’
information in other categories (i.e. businesses that went bad, investments lost, companies no longer in
business, etc.), nor did they mind telling us about large investments and other angels. In most other
categories, respondents’ indicated in detail about the parameters of their investments, timing, number and
order. It would appear by deduction that informal investors may not know what or how returns are
calculated for multi-period investments, or where the returns may have come in a series of payments, or in
different forms.

In finding out that only 17.9 percent had sold investments, we attempted to find out if any of the remaining
informal investors have ever tried to sell an investment. Only 4.5 percent reported ever trying to sell an
informal investment.

Bankruptcies and Voluntary Closures

A large number of informal investors report losing their investment through bankruptcy or voluntary
closure of the business. Almost thirty-seven percent (36.8) said that the investment was lost because the
company was no longer in operation. This is a large number of informal investments gone bad. This
number reflects the ‘gambling-like’ nature informal investment has come to represent; there are some real
winners and some real losers. The results here would indicate there many investments go bad which is
consistent with evidence of new firm survival (APEC, 1998)3

3

APEC (1998) reports that through either ‘bankruptcies, mergers, acquisitions or other forms of breakup,
52% of the region’s firms in 1989 were no longer identified in 1995’ (p.1).

Gender of Informal Investors

Nine (9.2) percent of the sample’s informal investors are women. This is a very surprising result since
most reports indicate that informal venture capital investment is almost exclusively the realm of men.
While 9.2 percent is not a large percentage, it is a larger number than is normally represented in the
convenience samples of informal investors where angels are hand-selected and interviewed about their
investment habits. This study demonstrates that women are highly under-represented in the hand selection
of participants for most non-randomly sampled angel research.

Habitual Investors

Habitual investors are those who have made more than one informal venture capital investment either
concurrently (portfolio informal investor) or successively (serial investor). There is strong evidence to
suggest that most informal investors will only ever make one informal investment; however, a substantial
number went on to make more than one investment.

One would think that the lack of reported returns, and the high incidence of lost investments would
negatively affect the number and incidence of second- and third-time investors. While the rate is
significantly lower than the number of first-time investors, there are still a large number of second- and
third-time investments taking place. A correlational analysis with a slightly larger sample of habitual
investors could help uncover more specific information about these very important informal investors. It
would be further interesting to know if their first and second investments were prior to or concurrent with
subsequent investments, and whether or not returns had any affect on future decisions to invest.

<-----Page 39----->39

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES IN FAMILY-RELATED ENTERPRISES
Informal venture capital investment normally precludes investments which are made in enterprises which
are owned and operated by family members. Therefore it is important to modify our estimate of informal
activity in the Region by those investments which were involved in family businesses.

Investing in Businesses Started by Family Members

More than a third of the respondents (34.9 percent) who had made informal investments had made them in
firms which were started by a family member. We generally classify these investments as love money, the
term given to investments made into companies which are started by family members. Love money is not
generally included in the definition of informal venture capital investment so we are interested then to know
that 34.9 percent of these investments are going to family sources.

(26.3 percent) were invested in a company started by a family member. No one reported that they had
made three investments into companies started by family members.

COMPANIES FINANCED WITH INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT

After responding to questions about their personal investment activities, respondents were referred to a
specific company name. All further questions related to the activities of this company specifically.
Particularly important, was their relationship to the company.

Respondents’ Relationship to the Company

As each company was randomly selected, a contact person was then identified. The contact person was the
first or second name in the company’s list of directors. In so doing, we realized that we may be reaching a
solicitor/agent/lawyer, an entrepreneur, or an investor. What, then, was their relationship to entrepreneurial
venture sampled from the Registries’ databases?

In each case, we asked respondents if they were the ‘lawyer, entrepreneur or an investor’ in the specific
company. Repeatedly, respondents wanted to refer to themselves as ‘owners,’ or ‘entrepreneur and
investor.’ These comments were collected and recorded in the data collection as well. It is clear that in
category #4, many entrepreneurs cannot extricate their role as entrepreneurs from those as investors
because they had put their own time, money and energy into the project. To differentiate entrepreneurs
from informal investors, the lead idea person and manager for the firm was the entrepreneur. An investor
invested money into a company that was ‘largely operated by someone else.’

More than 75 percent of the respondents referred to themselves as the entrepreneurs in the company. Of
that group, 20 percent refused to simply call themselves entrepreneurs and referred to themselves as
investors as well. Investors represented 9.6 percent of the respondents. Lawyers represented 4 percent of
the respondents.

There is a very small role, .9 percent, for lawyers as entrepreneurs and investors which is contrary to
popular opinion about lawyers’ involvement in informal investing. Their role is likely more advisory in
their knowledge of new company start-ups and its resulting capital structure to the extent that it is reflected
in the company’s directors.

Still Conducting Business

Almost 20 percent of the companies incorporated within the past five years admit to not conducting
business anymore (19.6 percent). This number may seem high, however, it would be consistent with other
reports of failures in new business. Methodologically, at this point, we may want to consider the number of
phone listings which were disconnected and no longer in service, their importance and fate.

The 12 companies which did not respond to this question were either lawyers who responded to the
individual and personal first part of the survey but would not respond to the company related information,
or individuals who, after completing the individual and personal part of the survey, did not want to
complete the remainder of the survey.

Companies Financed by Angels

Respondents were asked about any informal investment within the specific company with which they were
associated. Most of the respondents we spoke with were the entrepreneurs and investors so they would
have intimate knowledge of the companies initial capital structure and subsequent investments as well.

Almost 15 percent (14.8 percent) of the companies incorporated in the Atlantic Region between the period
1992 to 1997, had some form of informal investment -- capital which was contributed by someone other
than the lead or initial entrepreneur. This rate is high and has very positive implications given the
significant number of companies which are started each year. A number of people preferred to not answer
this question. Others indicated some type of shareholding by employees or family and were therefore not
included as informal venture capital investments.

By far, the greatest number of companies (76.1 percent) had only one (45.7 percent) or two (30.4)
informal investors. Interestingly, three and four investors were reasonably common representing
17.4 percent together.

There are a considerable number of informal investments taking place in the Atlantic Region’s newly
incorporated companies. Sadly, we do not have any comparison for our results since there are no other
broad based, randomly sampled, regional works.

Ranging from $500 to $1,000,000, reports of the contributions by informal investors to Atlantic Canadian
companies in this sample alone totalled more than $5,303,500. Furthermore, this does not include all the
investments made since some respondents preferred not to divulge this information. The categorisation of
1st, 2nd, etc. investors does not imply any relative ordering, but simply our coding of the number of
investors per respondent. These reports could have been given in any order by the respondent. Once
again, we see a large contribution to new enterprise from outside the immediate entrepreneurial team.

Even fewer companies wanted to report on the share holdings of the informal investors noted. The

On average, informal investors are taking reasonably sized equity holdings in the companies in which they
invest (29.7 percent). Very few are taking majority positions. In cases where dollars invested and equity
taken are both reported, only three respondents showed a majority position: one took 51 percent for
$15,000; another took 60 percent for $60,000; and the third took 75 percent for $40,000. It would appear
that these angels are not inclined to desire or exercise strict control over their investees. We can take into
account that in the far majority of all the respondents reporting, we are talking to the entrepreneur who
would have detailed and intimate knowledge about the share structure.

Incidence of Success in Businesses with Angels

The following sections consider some of the descriptive analyses possible when we split the sample by the
presence or absence of angel investment in the firm. There were 18 cases missing in this analysis.

<-----Page 46----->46

There seemed to be only a slightly higher incidence of companies still conducting business for the firms
which had angel money (82.6 percent) versus those that did not have angel money (79.5 percent). ‘Yes’
and ‘no’ in the chart refer to the question ‘Is this company still conducting business?’

These results have interesting implications for the ‘signalling’ effect entrepreneurial equity holdings are
supposed to portend. The signalling effect of business expectations theorizes that entrepreneurs ‘signal’
their likelihood for success by refusing to give up larger portions of equity. While there are considerable
other exogenous variables, in this instance, those who held all the equity did not fare any better than those
who obviously gave up some portion of their companies.

Incidence of Gender in Firms with Angels

Female respondents have a greater proportion of angel participation in their firms. Female respondents
with angel investment in their firm represented 26.7 percent of the ‘angels in the firm’ portion of the
sample, while females only represented 18.6 percent of those reporting no angel investment in the firm.

We do not want to attribute too much to this finding since there are many variables involved, however, it is
possible that angel money makes it possible for a greater proportion of women to start companies. It is
also possible that, given the high incidence of investment in businesses started by family members, further
analysis could produce findings demonstrating that much of the family money may be going to women.

CONSTRUCTING AN ESTIMATE OF ATLANTIC REGION INFORMAL
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

We have created an estimate of informal investment activity for the Atlantic Region from two different
perspectives. Constructing an estimate using two different approaches, and then comparing them, provides
a measure of validity; two different methods which produce similar results provides us with further
confidence in the measures employed. The two different approaches to constructing an estimate are:
building on the informal investment activity of individual persons, and building on the informal investments
reported within existing companies.

Estimate # 1

1.) In the first instance, we calculate the amount of investment per province as per the sample and
extrapolate that based on the weightings established from the number of companies formed in the province
and the sample size for the province. (In and of itself, the fact that many of the non-respondents made
negative references to the businesses current operating standing as a reason for not responding does not
necessarily reflect on the companies’ start-up or informal investment capital at start-up. In other words,
because they are not in operation now, is no reason to suggest that they did not have angel investment at the
time. We are assuming these companies had the same proportions of informal investment capital as the
respondents.)

To accurately reflect the weighting for each province, we explode each provincial category by its respective
weighting as dictated by the proportion of the number of companies in the sample to the number of
companies incorporated in that province during the five-year period. We then multiply the investments
made by individuals by the weighting factor.

2) In the figure below, we modify the amount of new venture investments by the proportion of investments
(by subtracting family investments) which are devoted to investments in businesses started by family
members (‘Minus Family’). This produces an estimate of a five-year sum per province.

3) This five-year estimate is modified to give an annual estimate for the Region.

This table shows the sum of the investments made by individuals in the provincial sample multiplied by the
weighting factor to bring it up to the size of the population of new companies in the Region for the period.
After subtracting the proportion of dollars which are invested into businesses started by family members
(34.9 percent), what is left is an estimate which represents the informal investment for the Region for a
five-year period. Based on personal investment activity of persons related to the business community the
annual estimate for informal investment for the Region is more than $61.3 million.

In this calculation, we are extrapolating the individual’s personal investments based on weightings
calculated by the proportion of companies in the sample and its respective province. These are the
investments made by persons who are closely related to the new venture/small business/ entrepreneurial/
informal investor community. With the random sample from the population of new companies, we have
adequately captured and represented all those who are inclined to invest from this community. There is a
sector of informal investor who is beyond this community, however. These would be informal investors
who are not a part of the new venture/small business/entrepreneurial community; these are the other
investors such as laborours, professionals and others. Therefore, for this reason, and because there are
more people associated with companies than there are companies, we would expect this estimate
($61.3 million) is lower than the real number.

Estimate # 2

1.) This method of calculating informal investment activity in the Atlantic Region uses the newly
incorporated companies as the unit of analysis. The amount of informal investment capital contributed to
the start-up or growth reported by the entrepreneurs and investors in the firms is totalled for each province.
This investments are shown in the following figure. The sums are represented in Figure 36.

2.) In the Figure 36, the informal investment capital contributed as reported is weighted by its proportion
of the provincial sample to provide a calculation of the provincial estimate. The provincial figures are
combined to give a regional total.

3.) If we take family involvement as given in individual investment at a rate of 34.9 percent, and reduce the
regional total by that amount, and then divide the difference by the five-year period, we arrive at an annual

<-----Page 52----->52

estimate. The annual estimate for Atlantic Region informal investment calculated using the firm as the
unit of analysis is $85 million.

Discussion

These estimates represent the culmination of a ‘grass roots’ approach to estimating informal venture capital
activity. They are based on the results of a randomly sampled group of recently incorporated companies.
The sample numbers are sufficient to produce a better than 95 percent confidence interval. The methods
used to estimate and ‘gross up’ the sample results may be subject to far more error as they are methods
which are subject to significantly more exogenous variables and influences. Nevertheless, this is the most
comprehensive and conclusive method to date. This work could be improved by having a better
understanding of the persons who refused to be interviewed as well as those who appeared to have working
telephone numbers, but who we were unable to reach by phone.

The fact that the two numbers calculated by the two different methods are different is expected and
supports the validity of this method. The total suggested by the first method ($61.3 million) should be
lower than what is actually the case because we only interviewed one sector of the possible investing public
-- the new venture business community. The second estimate, $85 million, is likely much closer to the true
number. The $23.7 million difference between the two represents the amount of informal investment
activity which is undertaken by individuals who are not related to or part of the business start-up/
entrepreneurial/new venture community. This difference represents a 38.7 percent ($23.7 m/$61.3 m)
increase over the first estimate which seems like a reasonable number for informal investment from persons
beyond the immediate entrepreneurial community.

This method varies significantly from the favoured approach, until now, of using convenience and
judgement samples. These are characterised by identifying a few select individuals who are known to have
made informal investments and interviewing them about their activities. Convenience samples are also
known as judgement samples not because the researcher uses judgement in selecting who will be
interviewed, but because the results must be tempered with judgement after they are produced. Results
from other studies are in no way representative and give us no information about the status of informal
investment in the Region as a whole.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Refrain from perpetuating the mistaken identity of informal investors.

To date angel research has focused on wealthy, male individuals who are known to invest in the business
enterprises of other individuals. We have come to call these informal venture capitalists ‘angels.’ Angel
literature has described angels as limited in number and invisible in their activities. They invest in few
proposals and are reported to like the ‘fun’ and sport of investing. We have come to typify them as elitist,
rare, and hard to come by.

This research has shown that the incidence of angel investment is much wider than has otherwise been
thought. Our methods of selecting angels have constrained our research. We now only look for people
who are ‘angel-like’ and who fit the typology described above. Wealthy businessmen, who are known to
have invested in a number of businesses locally, are approached to be interviewed about their investment
prospects. This typology pervades the literature and is self perpetuating because of the methods which are
used to select informal investors for research purposes. In effect, our thinking has led us down a very
narrow, self perpetuating path. We have come to identity an entire group by what is really only a very
small sub-sector of the group.

Thirteen percent of individuals (20.2 percent modified by 34.9 percent family investments) related to new
venture start-ups have some sort of informal venture capital investment background. Ten percent of new
businesses (14.8 percent modified by 34.9 percent family investment) have some sort of informal venture
capital in their capital structure and the average number of informal investors in these companies is more
than two. It seems inappropriate and inaccurate to represent as elitist and rare, a commodity which is
so widely represented in business start-ups.

More attention needs to be focused on the ‘grass roots’ informal venture capital investor who is responsible
for contributing significant sums into very risky ventures and who is doing so without much study, support
or attention. In our quest for glamorous results we have directed our attention to only one ‘layer’ of the
informal investing public. On these we have lavished our attention. While it is important that this group of
informal venture capital investors receive study, it is important that we not mistakenly identify the group by
one of its elements. Use of the popularised term ‘angel’ may promote this thinking.

<-----Page 55----->55

2. Make available informative materials for informal investors
It is clear that there are a large number of informal investments taking place representing a significant sum
of personal investment dollars. In a sample of 328 respondents, 95 informal investments were placed by the
respondents over a five-year period. This activity, in terms of both the number of companies supported, the
number of people involved, and the number of dollars placed, is largely unrecognised.

Investors in the sample did not identify the return received upon selling their shares. We speculated earlier
on the reasons why respondents were not clear on, or were not prepared to talk about, the returns they
received. Firstly, they may not wish to divulge the information to a stranger over the phone, but this is
surprising in light of some of the other information that they were prepared to divulge. Another explanation
for this may have been that they were unsure of a method of representing the return, either in percentages or
multiples, whether it should be calculated for the entire period or adjusted for an annual return, or that they
had never calculated the return. In addition, a large number of informal investors lose their investment
when the investee closes or goes bankrupt.

Like other types of investing, informal venture capital investors can be supported with materials which can
help them make good investment decisions. These are materials which support and facilitate the ease with
which informal investors can speed the process of making an investment, and materials which highlight the
common problems of informal investment. Material developed to support and facilitate informal venture
capital investment would:
• inform them about perusing many opportunities;
• ensure they are properly protected in the shareholders agreement;
• provide prepared standardized clauses;
• identify ways they may be able to help the entrepreneur;
• identify key elements to consider when approached by the entrepreneur;
• consider how to prepare for exit in advance of the investment; and
• and identify target and achieved rates of return and their calculation.
This information could be made available in printed form or via small seminars; it could be disseminated
through lawyers or chartered accountant waiting rooms, financial institutions, or via mail or 1-800 numbers
where requests could be made.

3. Centre for the study and research on informal investors

The amount of informal investment activity identified in these results suggests that these entrepreneurs and
investors are very important to Atlantic Canadian entrepreneurship in general. The amount of money
Atlantic Canadians are prepared to solicit and invest is impressive. The results presented here are a
starting point to help identify the amount of activity. But one limited research study only scratches the
surface in attempts to understand the informal investor activities, results and habits.

A greater understanding of the smaller investors who are prepared to invest heavily in helping the
entrepreneurial ‘ramp up’ to success is in order. This is particularly relevant in an area where formal
venture capital is scarce and companies need to develop management skills and experience to be able to
move to higher levels of accomplishment to achieve formal venture capital levels. Evidence shows that
informal and formal venture capital are feeding grounds for one another, and that both flourish where the
other one exists (Fiet, 1993). Therefore, it is in our interest to encourage activity and research in this area,
particularly as there is much interest and money invested in encouraging formal venture capital locally.

Long range objectives should include the establishment of a database of informal investors to use in further
research. There are precious few longitudinal studies in entrepreneurship. By developing a database,
researchers and policy makers can have a randomly sampled and growing group of identified informal
investors who can act as data points for future studies. More research needs to take place to answer a
number of very pertinent questions. What role can networks play in this area? How well are investors
acquainted with entrepreneurs before investing. How did they meet their investor or entrepreneur? What
returns are they making? To whom are they selling their investments? Are they using the tax incentives or
do those matter?

The United Kingdom has a long-established database for companies and entrepreneurs who have been
involved in management buy-outs and management buy-ins. Governments, private sources, financial
institutions, researchers and others interested in entrepreneurial buy-outs and buy-ins are beneficiaries of
the Centre for Management Buy-out’s (CMBOR) on-going results and documentation. CMBOR’s
database is under the direction of Mike Wright, Brian Chiplin and Ken Robbie at the University of

<-----Page 57----->57

Nottingham4. CMBOR has been collecting information for more than a decade and the database has been
heralded as the single largest and most successful database and source of longitudinal data on
entrepreneurship and its financing in the world. As a centre devoted to entrepreneurial venturing, their
work can serve as an excellent model for Atlantic Canada interested in pursuing the knowledge of their
informal investors.

Personnel from relevant provincial and federal governments and agencies should visit the University of
Nottingham’s Centre for Management Buy-out Research as a model of a centre developed to promote
understanding of entrepreneurship by developing knowledge about the structural details of their investment
habits and activities. Entrepreneurship stands to benefit from our attention and support for informal
investors. A better understanding and knowledge of our informal investors will improve our ability to serve
them.

4. Eradicate possible age/success bias by interviewing candidates within months of
incorporation.

There is the tendency for methods of sample selection to bias samples towards successful entrepreneurs
which is a result of the tendency to interview entrepreneurs who have been in business for a number of
years (Aldrich, 1990; Busentiz and Murphy, 1996). It can be difficult to find good sources for samples
of very young companies (Busenitz and Murphy, 1996). More established lists produce slightly older
firms which, having survived longer, result in weeding out less successful firms with time thereby
producing a systematic bias. Registry of Joint Stock Company registrations have proved to be a
reliable source for identifying all young, newly incorporated companies (Farrell, 1997).

Because firms exhibit different strengths at different periods of their organisational lives, it is important
that we not systematically neglect firms with respect to age. Population ecology theory holds that
different companies are favoured at different organisational stages. With regards to population density,
r-specialists are favoured in the early stages of population density by moving quickly and taking
advantage of their first mover status to obtain resources. K-specialists are favoured at later stages of
population density when efficiency is necessary as the population nears its carrying capacity (Aldrich, 1990).

Professor Wright and Dr. Chiplin are in the University of Nottingham’s School of Management and
Finance. Dr. Robbie is a research fellow with CMBOR. The Centre is sponsored by a number of financial
institutions and venture capital companies.

<-----Page 58----->58

So, most foundings will be by r-specialists, but most researchers will focus on K- specialists
because they are those that will have become large and successful after a period of time. More
research effort should be spent on r-specialists while in the early stages of the life cycle as these are
their formative years. Early founders are favoured in the early stages of population density while late
forming firms are favoured at later (Aldrich, 1990).

There are indications that age and success biases are at work in the sample. We interviewed
entrepreneurial firms at least one to two years -- and sometimes five -- following their incorporation.
Many Atlantic Canadian respondents who indicated they did not want to complete the survey made
comments about the business “going out of business,” “folding,” “loosing their shirt” and so on. While
we fully expect many companies to go out of business, we would like to interview them about their
capital structure before this happens; otherwise, we lose the information which could be provided by
them forever. Sometimes, if we reach them too long after they have closed, they will not agree to be
interviewed because we reached them after they have become disenchanted. We need to reach them
about the status of informal investors in their company before they go out of business.

The short term objective of the next inquiry should systematically sample and interview new
companies, and their entrepreneurs and investors within a time period that controls for age/success
bias. Some nascent or embryonic entrepreneurs may have incorporated so an optimal time to interview
informal investors and entrepreneurs is about six months following the company’s date of
incorporation. In this way, they are less likely to be nascent entrepreneurs, but are more likely to have
established their capital and formalised a capital structure.

The questionnaire and telephone survey methodology of this research have already been established as
useful vehicles for this type of research project. The results new work will allow a comparison with
older information to determine a number of important contributions: Is there a difference in response
rates for companies which are interviewed closer to their incorporation dates than those who are older
interviewees? What is the level of informal investment funding for the firms which occupy the younger
group? Are the investment characteristics similar (sizes of investment, average investments,
bankruptcies, etc.) between the two groups?

<-----Page 59----->59

5. More co-operation between governments and researchers.

Governments should co-operate with researchers and provinces and federal governments could co-operate
to gain more knowledge about the incentives which have been put in place to encourage the efforts of
informal investors. Repeated attempts were made to gain access to information regarding the investment
tax credits available in some provinces. Sadly, approval to review the files for research purposes was
never obtained. As of October, 1997, 113 people took advantage of the Equity Tax Credit in Nova Scotia.
The Equity Tax Credit is a government program of tax relief for people investing in qualified companies.
The results shown here indicate that there are more investments that would have qualified than were applied
for, or approved under, the Equity Tax Credit incentive. More co-operation between governments and
researchers would help identify those who are taking advantage of such credits, the value they carry as an
incentive, the proportion of the investing public taking advantage of them, and of better ways to inform
prospective investees and investors.

6. Education for entrepreneurs on how to sell a business plan beyond the banks and
government.

The apparent availability of informal investment capital is encouraging. Entrepreneurs with solid business
prospects and good ideas should be able to find receptive and willing investors. The key will be instructing
and encouraging entrepreneurs to be creative in their financing alternatives beyond internal sources of
capital, banks, and government loans. With the distribution of angels being more pervasive than otherwise
thought, entrepreneurs should be encouraged to maximize their potential for finding an angel by presenting
their proposals to many business people.

Today, business plans are a standard part of the entrepreneurs’ vocabulary and arsenal of tools. Armed
with this information and a business plan, entrepreneurs should be encouraged to ‘shop’ their ideas in the
capital marketplace -- except that the capital marketplace is broader and more diverse than initially
thought. Information and education for entrepreneurs looking for angels could include:
• the characteristics informal investors use as criteria,
• how to find potential sources of informal investors,
• selling to potential angels, and that
• informal investors are more pervasive than otherwise thought.

<-----Page 60----->60

7. Initiate longitudinal research investigations into informal venture capital investment.

The causal effects and outcomes of investment decisions can only be determined with longitudinal analysis.
The passage of time permits the resolution of the capital decisions made by the entrepreneur, the businesses
success or failure, and the investment decisions made by the investor. By following, over time, the
investment habits of the investors, their re-investment propensity, and the effects of the capital on
companies and entrepreneurs we would have a far better understanding of their investments, returns and
holding periods. With regards to returns, the literature shows very little ‘actual’ information and a lot of
‘expectation’ information. The reluctance of respondents to clearly present the returns that they achieved
would be improved if relationships were established to present information repeatedly.

Data loss is a difficulty with longitudinal research for entrepreneurial candidates who may be more inclined
to being short-lived than other species. Samples must be sufficiently large to accommodate the data loss
and still have a statistically viable sample as the years pass (Busenitz and Murphy, 1996). This is
expensive research, however, the value of entrepreneurship to society should make it easier for researchers
to raise the funds to do longitudinal research (Bygrave, 1990).
