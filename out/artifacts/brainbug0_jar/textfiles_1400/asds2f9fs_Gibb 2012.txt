Exploring the synergistic potential in
entrepreneurial university development:
towards the building of a strategic
framework

Emeritus Professor Durham University, Durham, UK

This article aims to provide a framework for exploration of a strategic approach to entrepreneurial university
development. It draws on earlier reviews by the author of the entrepreneurial concept and of the now
considerable global literature on the theme of the entrepreneurial university, although there is a strong focus
in this article on the UK. It also draws lessons from practice in exploring with several universities the
potential for creating strategic synergy between existing activities in the institution not all of which would be
labelled entrepreneurial in the conventional sense. Each of these key activities are briefly reviewed in turn and
presented as a basis for action in drawing together a strategy for the university.
Keywords: entrepreneurhip and enterprise education; Entrepreneurial University; strategy; synergistic potential

his article is focused on providing a conceptual
base for practice in entrepreneurial university
development. It briefly explores the opportunities
for creating strategic and operational synergies between
the various ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘enterprising’ activities
being undertaken by universities as a basis for the
building of a ‘real time’ entrepreneurial development
strategy. It argues that such a review can lead to the
development of a more soundly based strategic orientation towards entrepreneurship.1 It is written with the
objective of providing a briefing for those in the higher
education sector wishing to review the potential of their
own institution to become more entrepreneurial. It is
therefore in part unashamedly normative in seeking to
provide a guide for action.
The article is derived from both concept and practice.
Concept issues are dealt with at greater length (too
substantial to be recorded in this article) in two articles
written by the author (one supported by others) published
online by the then National Council for Graduate En-

The expression ‘strategic orientation’ is preferred to ‘strategic plan’
in recognition of the nature of decision making and planning in
entrepreneurial companies and in the present context of high levels of
uncertainty and complexity (see Gibb & Scott 1986; Shattock, 2000).

as a lever for Change’ (Gibb, 2005) was written as a policy
article for the Council and explores the argument for a
basic redefinition of the entrepreneurial concept and the
associated various stages that might be there in entrepreneurial university development. The second ‘Leading the
Entrepreneurial University’ (Gibb, Haskins, & Robertson,
2009) is a substantial review of the international literature
on university entrepreneurial development and was written
to provide a conceptual frame for an ‘Entrepreneurial
University Leadership Programme’ based mainly at Oxford University in 2009/2010 for senior UK and International university staff.3 Further supportive references for
some of the key issues identified can therefore be found in
the above papers.
The practice base for this article derives from several
experiences. The first is a review by the author of the
potential for the development of a ‘whole university’
integrative approach to entrepreneurship education at
Kingston University, UK.4 The second derives from
experiments by the author in involving participants in

the NCGE International Entrepreneurship Educators’
Programme (IEEP)5 in a comprehensive review of influences on development of entrepreneurship activity in their
higher and further education institutions. The third results
from reflection in using the framework set out below as the
basis for senior university staff workshops.
It is argued that a review of the kind proposed has
become highly relevant in an environment of much greater
uncertainty and complexity for higher education institutions  a result of the deep impact of globalisation
compounded by the financial crisis and cuts in public
expenditure, across Europe and beyond. This scenario is
likely to last for some years. Against this backcloth, it is
important to recognise that universities have different
priorities, cultures, norms, knowledge and research
emphases and traditions. For example, in the UK context,
there is evidence to support the view that staff of post-1992
UK universities (former polytechnics) are more likely to
engage with a wider range of external stakeholders than
their more traditional counterparts (Buckland, 2004;
McCaig, 2006). The composition of the university in terms
of disciplines will also considerably influence the nature of
entrepreneurial engagement. Universities are pluralistic
organizations, and cultures and ‘ways of doing things’ vary
between disciplines and departments. Many universities
now have a substantial number of vocational degrees. In
the older universities, there is often an emphasis on areas
that might broadly be described as ‘professional’, including medicine and health, law and accountancy as well as
perhaps engineering. Even in some of the more traditional
areas of the humanities such as music, art and divinity,
there are strong elements of vocationalism and professionalism. These scenarios influence considerably the scope
for enterprise and entrepreneurial initiative.
In undertaking a review as the basis for developing
institutional strategies, it is, therefore, recognised that
each university will have its own perspectives. Consequently, not all of the issues noted below will have the
same weight of significance. The article might, therefore,
be used by readers as a basis for exploration of those
areas of particular concern to the institution and the
identification of leadership challenges.
In all universities, there exist a range of ‘entrepreneurial related activities’, although they may not be labelled as
such. It is argued below that a major challenge is to
explore synergy between them and by this means draw
them into a ‘whole university’ approach to entrepreneur5
The IEEP is aimed at the development of university educators from
all disciplines to equip them with a mastery of a number of
‘leadership competencies’ in the entrepreneurship education field.
The programme involves an ‘audit’ of institution entrepreneurial
activity likely to influence the capacity of the institution to
effectively absorb educational initiatives. It forms the basis for a
strategic ‘bottom up’ review to identify opportunities and
constraints. For a review of the programme and its conceptual
underpinning, see Gibb (2011).

ial development. Key areas to be explored are set out
under the broad headings as in Fig. 1.
The paper is set out as follows. First, there is a brief
descriptive background to each key area as in Figure1: this
is followed by a short list of potential key issues, drawn
from both the literature and experience, that could provide
a template for strategic exploration. A possible ‘audit’
document is provided in Annex 2 although it is the author’s
view that this should be used with some caution. The article
concludes with a view as to the potential for synergy. It is
first important to clarify the basic ‘enterprise’ and ‘entrepreneurship’ concepts to be used.

Agreement on concept and philosophy
Concept is key to the development of an appropriate level
of shared understanding of the words entrepreneurship
and enterprise. Often there are confusions, with the
former word associated with commercialisation of university intellectual property (IP) and the latter sometimes
seen as confined to business-related activity. Moreover,
there will be much entrepreneurial and enterprising
activity in a university that is not labelled as such. The
definitions in Annex 1, expanded from those adopted by
the NCGE, are designed to assist (for a fuller discussion
of this, see Gibb, 2002, 2005).6 Innovation is proposed as
an outcome from entrepreneurial and enterprising behaviour coupled with the degree to which these behaviours
are enhanced by organisation design, culture and the
environment in general. Innovation in the university
context can include among other things: new programme
development; new innovative pedagogy; new forms of
stakeholder relationship; new developments in alumni
relations; new approaches to and developments from,
research; new transdisciplinary ventures in research and
teaching; new forms of partnership with business; new
forms of international relationships; new social enterprise
activity; and, importantly, experiments in governance and
organisation design.
The degree of acceptance of the relevance of the
enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation concepts to
the future of a university will be a function of its basic
philosophy pertaining to: the importance it attaches to the
direct utility of its work in meeting the needs of society;
the associated contextualisation of its research and
development activity; its focus on the related integration
of knowledge as opposed to preserving the boundaries of
existing disciplines; its concern to be a ‘learning’ (as
opposed to ‘learned’) organisation (Senge, 1990; Kristensen, 1999); and its associated degree of openness to the
acquisition of knowledge from any source and in any form,
6

While in English, it is possible to make distinctions between
enterprise and entrepreneurship as set out in Annex 1, in many
languages, for example, Spanish, Croatian and Danish, there is no
word for ‘enterprise’ with the same meaning as given in the Annex.

including tacit knowledge (Gibbons et al., 1994; Wenger,
1998: Nowotny, Scott, & Gibbons, 2003).

Issues of mission, strategy and governance
Mission and strategy
Many university mission statements and published strategies worldwide embrace the word ‘Enterprise’ or
‘Entrepreneurship’ (OECD, 2001; Currie, 2002; Barsony,
2003; Jacob, Lundqvist & Hellsmark, 2003; Etzkovitz,
2004; Kirby, 2006; Bridgeman, 2007). There are often
several contexts associated with this commitment, including the university’s concern with: knowledge exchange
and transfer; support of development from research; the
level and nature of business and community engagement;
the need to compete internationally; the development of
enterprising students within the employability agenda;
and the raising of finance/revenues from non-public
sources. A key factor is the degree to which, formally
and informally, the notion of enterprise is accepted as
part of the ‘Idea’ of the university and not alien to views
of its autonomy (for different views on this see, for
example, Mawditt, 1998; Viale & Etzkowitz, 2005;
Berglund, 2008; Crow, 2008).
The major issues shaping the incorporation of enterprise and entrepreneurship into the university’s strategic
plan seem to be: its stated mission; its degree of concern
for the relevance of its research output; its recognition of
its role in, and level of commitment to, addressing the
problems of society; the strength of its associated
commitment to knowledge transfer and exchange; the
related commitment to business development; and more

recently its focus upon graduate employability. Fully
integrating these concerns into the detail of a plan seems
to be a major challenge.7 A key strategic issue is the
degree to which university leadership seeks to embed
responsibility for the above issues within the faculties and
departments (Blackmore & Blackwell, 2008; Kweik,
2008).

Governance
Key issues relating to the enterprise/entrepreneurship
concept adopted and its degree of influence on the
university strategy in this respect seem to be: the nature
and strength of the influence of the council or management board of the university on the commitment to
partnership with business and the community (Miller
& Katz, 2004); the degree of active engagement of
‘external’ members of boards (as opposed to attendance
at meetings) (Committee of University Chairs, 2009); the
level of active engagement of university staff with external
stakeholder initiatives (as opposed to staff being members of associations/agencies and merely attending
meetings) (Bleiklie & Kogan, 2007; Geuna & Muscio,
2008); the strength, compactness and credibility of the
executive team (Ackroyd & Ackroyd, 1999; Bleiklie
& Kogan, 2007); the levels of cooperation and trust
between professional and academic staff in dealing with
such issues as knowledge transfer, employability and
business relations/development (Kwiek, 2008); the degree
of ‘ownership’ of the issues, by faculties, deans and

departmental heads and individual academics (Kohler &
Huber, 2006, p. 112); and the nature and strength of
leadership in supporting an enterprise culture in the
university (Todorovic, McNaughton, & Guild, 2005 also
see below).

Organisation design
Organisations can be designed to constrain enterprising/
entrepreneurial behaviour or facilitate it (Gibb, 2005,
Barrie, 2007). Key factors shaping the latter include: the
levels of decentralisation of decision making and responsibility for strategies as well as operations; the associated
flexibility in integrating strategies and action; the degree
to which individuals, bottom-up, are empowered to
innovate; the associated level of support for autonomy
and the taking of responsibility, for example, in building a
personal network and working with key external stakeholders; the degree to which departmental heads and
faculty leaders are prepared to support risk taking and
share responsibility for that risk; the degree to which staff
are rewarded for a wide range of innovative behaviour (as
described above under ‘Concept’) as opposed solely for
research and publication; the level of support, operationally and strategically, for cross-departmental and transdisciplinary research, teaching and development; and the
degree to which the university shares, and is held
together, by a culture that embraces the above (Bratianu
& Stanciu, 2010).
Knowledge organisation
The stance taken on the disciplinary nature and, therefore, structure of the university is fundamental to its
organisation and arguably also to its potential for
entrepreneurialism. A distinction can be made between
multi-disciplinarity, inter-disciplinarity and transdisciplinarity (Nicolesc, 2008). The first implies a juxtaposition
of disciplines, the second and interaction between established disciplines and the last the creation of a new set of
axioms to confront, explore and explain a phenomenon.
Arizona State University, for example, has organised
itself
wholly
around
trans-disciplinary
centres
(Crow, 2008).
The merging of, and interaction between, disciplines
has been a feature of the US research university scene
over the past decade or so, stimulated by the public
research foundations and Federal and State imperatives
for solutions to societal problems (US Department of
Education, 2006). Such initiatives are not solely the
domain of science faculties but extend also into the
humanities. The focus, and some argue the driver, for this
is a desire to respond more closely to issues of importance
to society (for example, in the US, for example, focus on
black studies, women’s studies, disability studies, sustainability studies, health studies and third-age studies). In
developing countries, this trend also is being followed 

the example of Sri Lanka being in line with an urge to
discard the ‘old colonial’ concept of a university of
‘learning for its own sake’, which does not seem to match
the needs of the country.8
Key issues in leading universities to this transition in
knowledge organisation include: the publicly articulated
demand for universities to demonstrate value to society
and align themselves with policy goals (Lambert, 2003); a
stronger focus on a creative problem-solving approach
that demands transdisciplinarity; an imperative by this
means to defend academic freedom; a drive for intellectualism rather than narrow scholasticism (Cherwitz,
2002, 2005); student and professional demands for career
relevance; and a search for innovation (McInnis, 2001;
Etzkowitz, 2004; Greenhalgh, 2008).
In the UK, there has been a growth of interdisciplinary
research and teaching centres: but overall, internationally,
the development has been cautious and is still the focus of
much debate (US National Academy of Science 2004).
However, it can be argued that such an approach to
teaching and research opens up considerable potential for
adding entrepreneurial value to the work of the university.

Measuring excellence through public value
The concept of public value has its origins in the work of
Mark Moore, Professor of Non-profit Organisations in
the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (Moore, 1995). The concept has been highly
influential in debates in the UK government concerning
impact measurement of public expenditure. It eschews
conventional costbenefit analysis in emphasising three
aspects of performance: delivering actual services; achieving social outcomes; and maintaining trust and legitimacy in the delivery agency. It is the last mentioned that
is particularly innovative in that it focuses on the
processes by which the institution creates its legitimacy
in society including, for example: funder relationships
and their diversity; visibility and legitimacy with the
public in general; relationships with government regulators; reputation with the media; credibility with civil
society sectors; and volunteer roles and relations. It is
these ‘aims’ that dictate the building of operational
capacity, combining together to determine and create
public value outcomes. The key issues for the university
in this respect are, therefore, the degree to which it seeks
to measure its own excellence as perceived through the
eyes of the ‘legitimate’ stakeholders and whether this is
reflected in its vision, mission, strategy and process (ways
of doing things).

Leveraging public and private finance
Throughout the Western World and in the European
Community as a whole, it is forecast that universities will
face a continuous upward cost pressure, at rates in excess of
inflation (Schwarzenberger, 2008). Costs are likely to outpace the potential trajectories of increasing revenues  at
least without a supplementation of governmental revenue.
This scenario most probably holds for the United
Kingdom and creates additional pressure for wider stakeholder engagement. The public policy focus for this
engagement over the past decade has been through
funding from the UK Higher Education Funding Council
(HEFCE) for what has been designated ‘Third Stream
Activity’ aimed broadly at enhancing the direct and
indirect economic contribution of Higher Education.
Monies available under this programme, the Higher
Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), were small relative
to the total HEFCE financing of universities  in 2008/2009
£110mn. compared with £7.3bn. Third stream activity is
defined in terms of: joint and contract research including
spinouts, engagement in networks of stakeholders, contribution to community activities and placement of students and staff with business and social enterprise.
Under the new UK funding arrangements, where most
of teaching costs are to be covered by student fees the
emphasis will be on attracting students and their fee
income. But, there will also be an increasing challenge to
find new forms of revenue from: renting out of underutilised assets; the broadening of the activities of available
human resources, in particular pursuit of a more substantial level of consulting activity across all departments
of the university not just business schools; more vigorous
pursuit of research contracts particularly commercial
research and development contracts; sales of IP; spinoffs; philanthropy; closer partnerships with private providers and in some cases privatization; cost savings by
subcontracting out of a wide range of services; and seeking
new forms of leveraging from existing private resources. In
the United Kingdom, in general it would appear that nontuition fee and research income constitute less than a
quarter of revenue in many universities (Williams, 2009).

Stakeholder engagement and partnership
This has several components covering: relationships with
regions and cities; engagement with business; links with
social enterprise; approaches to alumni engagement;
media linkages; relationships with professional bodies;
and, importantly, the interface with entrepreneurs. Overall, the nature and level of engagement with the above is a
function of the degree of focus of the university on
creating value in society, linking its goals, research and
organisation of knowledge around key areas of societal
need and concern as described earlier. This is what has
been described as the philosophy and pursuit of wisdom
rather that the philosophy of knowledge (Maxwell, 1984).

Regional and local partnerships
Over the past decade, there has been a growing emphasis
in higher education policy across the world on the role of
universities in local and regional development, extending
from the more established policy focus of their role in the
commercialisation of research (Boucher, Conway, & Van
Der Meer, 2003; Charles, 2006; IHEP, 2007; Arbo &
Benneworth, 2008). In the United Kingdom, in response
to this shift, the Regional Development Agencies (now
abolished) have increasingly seen universities as hubs of
regional development and innovation strategies. Some
argue that this places universities instrumentally as part
of the governance of regions rather than merely purveyors of knowledge (Smith, 2007). The entrepreneurial
role in this context relates to finding innovative means to
contribute to regional social, cultural and community
development. Not all universities would wholly buy into
this scenario.
Key issues for consideration in this respect include: the
degree of university focus in its strategic plans and
mission on the particular strengths, weaknesses and
distinctive culture of a region and recognition of the
‘need to know’ associated with the region’s economic,
social and cultural development; the degree to which the
university sees its international activity as bringing
opportunity to the region and providing the means for
working in partnership with regional and local institutions in this respect; the focus in university research and
development on areas of potential regional endogenous
knowledge-based growth; the degree of emphasis on
engagement with specific clusters of local industry and
services; associated emphasis on linking graduates with
local companies, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); the level of active engagement of the
university in local civic and cultural events; and the
strength of relationships with former local alumni.
Partnerships with business
A major component of the above is engagement with
business. Key manifestations of engagement include: the
level of business research grants; the number of active
partnerships in development from research and problem
solving; levels of consultancy; business active (as opposed
to notional) engagement in the governance of the
university; business engagement with the teaching of the
university; joint degrees with individual businesses or
groups of businesses; levels of graduate placement with
companies; university ‘extra-mural’ programmes focused
on management and/or business development; as well as
levels of knowledge exchange and transfer activity
(Etzkowitz, 2008).
The policy agenda over the past decade in the United
Kingdom has been strong in this respect with numerous
white papers and reports urging stronger collaboration
(Dearing, 1997, Lambert, 2003, Sainsbury, 2007).

Engaging entrepreneurs
In the USA, the level of local business philanthropy is
considerably higher than in Europe reflecting the strength
of entrepreneurs’ engagement over time with US higher
education institutions (Sutton Trust, 2003). This is an
area of arguably great weakness in the United Kingdom,
particularly with respect to involvement of local SME
owners (Hughes, 2006). Key issues in a UK context
include: the level of teaching company activity with
SMEs; the use of entrepreneurs in teaching; joint
entrepreneurial ventures in research; the offering of status
to entrepreneurs as Fellows and Professors of Practice;
levels of graduate placement with SMEs; the degree of
real engagement with local SME-dominated associations
for example Small Business Clubs and Chambers of
Commerce; and the numbers of SMEs located in
university technology and science parks and actively
linked in to university activity.
There have been experiments on a national scale in
Scotland to give entrepreneurs a more prominent role in
the delivery of university entrepreneurship education,
based on the US Babson model, but with mixed success
(Hayward, 2000). There are experiments in entrepreneurial professors of practice in a number of UK universities,
including Newcastle, Anglia Ruskin and Cambridge
(based on the MIT model), but there is no widespread
programme of substantial embeddedness of entrepreneur
engagement across the universities.
Alumni engagement
Almost all universities have commitment to engagement
with alumni. But the level and intensity of this effort
varies substantially. A major component is the quality of
information recorded by the alumni office, key measures
of which include: the width of coverage of any data base;
the ability to trace, record and sort data in terms of career
structures and locations, and particularly, in the context
of the entrepreneurial university, to know how many of
former students own their own company or organisation.
Perhaps the best of alumni engagement practice in these
respects can be found in the USA (Cabrera, Weerts, &
Zulich, 2005).
Key components of sound alumni practice include: the
use of webtools for continued social and professional
networking; ‘graduation year’ regular reunions; alumni
conferences and meetings and support services; alumni
‘Halls of Fame’; awards for alumni excellence in performance in their community; regional and international
country clubs; careers and lifelong learning support;
magazines; entrepreneur alumni associations; regional
social and cultural events; focused discussion groups;
publication of directories; and volunteering (Baade, R.A.,
& Sundberg, J., 1996). Several UK universities have
initiatives focused on engaging alumni and entrepreneurs,
in particular, in mentoring and other support activity in

6

the university (Reading, York and Teesside Universities
for example).

Social enterprise
Social enterprises are organisations with primarily social
objectives whose surpluses, if any, are reinvested for that
purpose in the organisation or the community. They do
not set out to create profits for shareholders. Social
enterprises are becoming an important part of economies
in many countries. In the United Kingdom, they now
constitute over 5% of all businesses (Chipperfield, 2009).
University engagement with social enterprise is one sign
of its commitment to the community and the broader
goals of a civil society. Key issues in university engagement include: the benefits perceived by the university in
terms of its reputation in the community and opportunity
for building relationships; support for opening gateways
to academics who wish to use their research for the broad
benefit of society; the provision of opportunities for
student engagement in exploring the value of their
disciplinary knowledge in society (which has been
labelled as ‘intellectual entrepreneurship’); enhancing
the potential for student exploration of career options
in the sector; providing an attractive gateway for alumni
involvement personally and financially; and, particularly,
providing opportunities for staff and students in departments of humanities to engage with the community.
Social enterprise activity can become an intrinsic part
of knowledge transfer/exchange activity, thus broadening
the reputation of the university in this field (Denny,
2011).

Knowledge transfer, exchange and support
Knowledge transfer
Over the past two decades, there has been considerable
public policy emphasis on university processes of knowledge transfer in both developed and developing economies (Lee, 1996; Shane, 2004; Kwiek, 2005). Yet,
as has been noted above, in the United Kingdom,
university income from commercial knowledge transfer
activity is very small compared with other forms of
revenue. Recently, the term ‘knowledge transfer’ has
been supplemented, and sometimes replaced by, ‘knowledge exchange’ in recognition of the fact that universities
do not hold a monopoly on knowledge and indeed have
much to learn from sources external to the university
(Delanty, 2003; Senges, 2007). Knowledge transfer can
be defined as the formal and informal transfer of new
discoveries and innovations resulting from research
(usually scientific) conducted at universities to the commercial and non-commercial sector for public benefit.
Key issues in this area include: the openness of
university IP policy (see below); the existence of formal
gateways of access to areas of university expertise (see for

<-----Page 6----->Exploring the synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development

example Knowledge House in the north of England 
www.knowledgehouse.ac.uk); the strength and degree
of personal entrepreneurialism in technology transfer
offices; the levels of informal and formal networking and
the building of relevant social capital of university staff;
the existence of career paths and rewards for staff who
engage in such activity; levels and modes of doctoral
student engagement with ‘real world’ problems; the
extent and depth of undergraduate and graduate project-type work particularly in SMEs; the degree of
embeddedness of responsibility for knowledge transfer/
exchange in faculties and departments, the strength of
external, particularly business, partnership in research
and development; and overall the degree to which the
research agenda of a university focuses on visible societal
opportunities and problems. Physical proximity of external partners and ‘clients’ may be particularly important in the case of SMEs (Muscio, 2007). The jury is still
out on the value in practice of university-based science
and technology parks in this process (see below).
Overall, a key issue to be confronted by many strong
research performance universities is the degree to which
academic researchers may be distracted by the pressure
to make their work directly transferable. Time management in this respect is, reportedly, critical. It is of
relevance to note that the vast majority of technology
transfer offices do not create net revenue, even in the
USA (Mars, 2005).

IP and licensing policies
It is claimed by a number of authorities that the impact of
this activity in universities on national competitiveness
and on job and company growth has been exaggerated
(Hughes, 2003). Most if not all universities will have
policies relating to the ownership of IP, inventions and
the regulation of licensing activity. The degree to which
the policy allows ownership of IP by the individual
academic varies: but in general in the United Kingdom,
in contrast to much of the practice in Europe, IP rights
are vested primarily with the university (Harman, 2007).
Key issues include: where responsibility for ownership of
IP is located in the university (in some universities in a
research services office); whether or not to establish a
separate company to handle the process of commercialising IP; the degree to which the issue is complicated by the
range and nature of any partnerships in the research
process (for example levels of external involvement,
business, government and international, in action, funding and sponsorship); and specific problems that arise
when research is funded by a company (relating particularly to further developments arising from the original
invention), such problems arising from the fact that a
patent or indeed product or process license may need
considerable time and investment before proof of concept
is established and it is incorporated in a formal product or

service acceptable to a consumer. Often, this process
results in numerous modifications. A further problem may
subsequently be that of governance, relating to individual
academics who have an ownership stake in companies in
areas relating to their research and the conflicts that
might arise between publication and disclosure of company IP (Duberley, Cohen, & Leeson, 2007).

Spin-offs
Spin-offs (new university-connected ventures) represent a
direct form of knowledge transfer and movement of IP
into new organisations. As with the IP and licensing
activity noted above, their scale and national impact
compared with other forms of technology transfer is
small, even in the USA (Hughes, 2003). Most new
research-based spin-offs remain small, and the time
horizon involved in those growing into substantial
businesses may extend to as long as 20 years. Spin-offs
may also embrace university knowledge and practice
outside of research-based activity, for example in finding
wider application for ‘internal’ practices in areas of IT,
educational pedagogy and laboratory testing.
The major key issues are: how to raise awareness of the
potential and the process and create reward systems for
such activity; how to ensure that the process is easy enough
and supportive enough to eliminate deviant behaviour (the
pursuit of company formation via third party and
university unrelated means); and how to manage the
process organisationally (via a specialist office?). The
research on this issue emphasises the paramount importance of academics building formal and informal network
relationships with business and other stakeholders in
smoothing the transfer process (Hughes 2003).
Incubators
In general, incubators are most commonly aimed at
providing a supportive environment for new business/
organisation ventures. The major performance indicator,
about which there is remarkably little evidence, is whether
they can be shown to add real value to the start-up
process in terms of improving survival rates, growth,
employment and profitability. Incubators can be physical
or virtual. Physical incubators conventionally embrace:
shared office space rented often on favourable terms;
shared business services (office and secretarial, accountancy, fax, telephone and printing); professional business
support (coaching); support for building networks (internally within the incubator and externally);
and occasionally, specialist finance availability. Virtual
incubators focus on providing mainly online business and
network development support.
Key issues in incubator management include: selection
of target groups (these may be open to any kind of
business or organisation or focused more precisely on
particular client groups such as technology-based firms,

IT businesses, specific sector groups, students, staff, social
enterprises or joint university/business ventures); criteria
used for selection in relation to stage of the proposed
business development (is the incubator, for example to be
only open to those with ‘proof of concept’); funding and
degree of subsidy if any; length of tenure of space and exit
strategy/criteria for tenants; and the degree of utilisation
of external business support services and agents (Bergek
& Norrman, 2008). Incubation processes can be linked
with promotional activity such as business plan competitions and formal training programmes. Pre-incubator
models can be provided for potential university technology spin-outs where the focus is on ‘proof of concept’.

Science and technology parks
For some, a major manifestation of a university’s
commitment to entrepreneurial engagement is the existence of a university Science Park. There are now
around 50 such parks in the United Kingdom . The
model was originally based on the experience of US
Stanford and MIT models. The most common form in
the United Kingdom is that of a partnership between the
university and external investors (public and private): in
this model the university may have only limited involvement in the day-to-day management. Site management is
usually by professionals. The initial focus of Parks was on
new technology-based firms. The original aim was to add
value by promoting university technology transfer, attract
firms with leading edge technology and foster networks
and linkages, internal to the university and Park as
well as external. Evaluation studies do not in general
support the notion that parks have created considerable
added value to the process of university knowledge
transfer and engagement in knowledge exchange (Siegel,
Westhead, & Wright, 2003). The evidence also indicates
that most companies on parks are not heavily involved
with the university as measured by: active engagement
in processes of technology transfer and exchange; joint
R and D programmes; hosting of numbers of companies
set up by university staff and/or students; and numbers of
doctoral and other students working with firms (Angle
Technology, 2003).
Key issues are, therefore: the degree to which the
university is really engaged with firms as above; the
degree to which the activities of the firms align with
the major research and teaching strengths of the university; the degree of collaboration between firms; and,
importantly, the levels of informal social and business
engagement of academics with staff of the companies.
Parks have been criticised as being mainly real estate
operations attracting firms to pleasant, prestigious, locations at reasonable rents.

Loan and equity finance
It has long been argued that a barrier to the success of
university spin-offs has been the lack of venture capital,
particularly that capital needed to ensure ‘proof of
concept’. The negative cash flow in a technology-based
new venture can last for several years. Yet, it has already
been noted above that many spin-offs do not grow and
60% will fail (Hughes, 2003). Only a small percentage
(6%) will develop into growth companies. Notwithstanding this data, an argument frequently presented is that
part of the survival and growth problem is the lack of
seed equity capital, although problems with loan capital
are arguably also of considerable importance.
There are numerous examples of venture funds linked
with universities particularly in the USA but also in some
major universities in the United Kingdom. Cambridge
University for example has its own seed fund, Cambridge
Enterprise Venture Partners, and also links with angel
investors. In general, however, few universities in the UK
have developed their own funded mechanisms to increase
the availability of venture and loan finance to internally
generated new ventures. They have, however, responded
to government initiatives in this area in particular the
University Challenge Fund (Jennings, 2009). This has
provided relatively small amounts of funding to universities who can demonstrate that they can harvest ideas
with commercial potential and are willing to seek
partnership with external investors. The Fund is aimed
at supporting the establishment of commercial viability,
the development of business propositions and incorporates some initial funding for start-up. The Fund has
clearly acted as a stimulus to some universities in
developing major external partnership initiatives of
which the £32mn Premier Fund at the University of
Manchester is an example (said to be one of the largest of
its kind in Europe).
Key issues therefore include: the degree to which a
university has been able to use policy initiatives as above
to leverage resource and interest from private companies,
venture capital organisations and angel investors; the
level of commitment of the university in using its own
resources; and the location of venture funding initiatives
particularly their links with technology transfer offices.
A major problem remains, however, in terms of the length
of time needed to achieve a viable business that can then
offer an exit strategy for formal venture capital companies. In this respect, engagement with angels may be of
greater advantage.

Academic entrepreneurship
A major challenge in moving a university towards a more
entrepreneurial stance is finding champions to play the
role of change agents in faculties and departments across
the university. This is also a key to the success in

Citation: Annals of Innovation & Entrepreneurship 2012, 3: 16742 - DOI: 10.3402/aie.v3i0.16742

<-----Page 8----->Exploring the synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development

developing cross-campus initiatives. As noted in the
introduction to this article, it is not uncommon to find
many academics who are ‘enterprisingly’ engaged with the
external stakeholder community. Research demonstrates
that such personal interfaces are not confined to vocational, professional or business-related disciplinary areas
(PAPEC and Centre for Business Research Cambridge,
2009). Research also supports the view that the increasingly outward-facing profile of universities, backed up by
central professional management services, has been largely accepted by academics, some being more enthusiastic
than others! (PAPEC 2009) It is also argued that this
‘shift’ demands re-consideration of career development
and reward structures for academics, particularly those
heavily engaged with the wider stakeholder environment. This is already a route actively pursued by some
universities. The importance of exemplars and leadership
by Deans has been emphasised (Bercovic & Feldman,
2008). Finally, even the more research-minded academic
is being challenged by a growing demand for graduate
and particularly doctoral education to be more formally
concerned, than hitherto, with the ‘enterprising development’ of the individual student. This can be seen not
only as an intrinsic part of managing the research process
but also as essential preparation for the wider world of
work and even a future career in a more entrepreneurial
university (Research Councils UK and Vitae, 2011).

Entrepreneurship and enterprise education
Exploring the potential across the university
Universities are increasingly being challenged by governments and funding agencies to expand entrepreneurship
and enterprise education across the whole institution
(OECD, 2008). Many universities have confronted this
challenge by the creation of senior posts of responsibility
at dean, senior professional manager and/or pro vice
chancellor level. Following from the challenge of defining, agreeing and communicating the appropriate concept, noted above, there becomes a need to address a
number of key issues including: identifying what kinds of
programmes and pedagogies are needed right across the
university, linking entrepreneurship education to the
dynamic of the university’s strategy, mission and goals;
determining where these programmes might be located in
the university; knowing how to create ownership for a
whole cross-campus approach with the associated need to
demonstrate how such programmes can add value to the
work of individual faculties and departments; developing
staff competency to deliver new programmes and pedagogies; building on related areas of existing activity in the
university, for example careers/employability programmes
and knowledge transfer and business development services: expanding, the role of student project and work

experience programmes; and seeding student society
initiatives.
Identification of the potential and need for entrepreneurial and enterprise education across the university
covers six key areas:
(A) Creating wide awareness among the student population and staff of the need to develop a range of
personal enterprising competencies in preparing
students for a future personal and employment
world of greater uncertainty and complexity. These
competencies are not the same as those commonly
designated as transferable skills. In master classes,
and in research supported by the author, students
see entrepreneurial attributes as being very important to their future personal and work life world in
general. But, when asked to consider the degree to
which they are developed by the existing university
experience, there is an apparent gap to be filled
(Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning, 2009).
(B) Developing capacities to embed the delivery of these
competencies contextually within the curriculum
and pedagogy of different departments throughout
the university.
(C) Developing self-efficacy (awareness, know-how,
confidence and intention) to start a business or
pursue self-employment at some time in the future
(in recognition that one in seven graduates are likely
at some time to be self-employed in their future
career and that most graduate start-ups are likely to
be pursued by those in the age bracket 3040). In
this respect, it should be noted that much of the
growth in the micro sector of employment in jobs
across Europe has been in the white collar and
professional occupations, for example, health, leisure, financial services, sport, IT, business services in
general and there has been a growth in portfolio and
contract employment.
In enhancing self-efficacy a critical analogy is with
teaching people to swim in that should they be
placed in future in a position where they need to do
this they will have a stronger possibility of survival.
Moreover in developing individuals’ entrepreneurial
self efficacy some may like it so much that they
search for opportunities to ‘dive in’: thus entrepreneurship becomes ‘vocational’. It is rather difficult,
in any case, to teach people to swim on land!
D) Supporting current start-ups  developing the capacity of those who wish currently to find/exploit an
idea immediately and start a venture. There will
always be a small group of staff and students who
wish to pursue this.

<-----Page 9----->Allan Gibb

(E) Creating understanding of the life-world of work in
the micro-, small- and medium-sized organisation.
(F) Supporting directly the transition to employment in
SMEs and small organisations in general, including
social enterprises.

Linking entrepreneurship education to
university goals
All of the above directly relate to an employability agenda
and all are relevant to the future experience of all
students.
(A) and (B) relate more directly to teaching and
learning goals in that their successful pursuit is dependent
particularly on the way (pedagogy) knowledge is organised and delivered contextually within departments.
(C) and (D) in particular should be heavily focused on
‘know how’, ‘know who’ and personal ‘know why’ not
just ‘know-about’ as currently appears to be much of the
case. In this respect, the notion that theory and concept
cannot be completely embodied in practice and ‘learning
by doing’ seems often to stand in the way.
(C) should ideally be designed to fit into the particular
context of a department, for example: in Divinity on
‘running a church’, in Media in managing a portfolio
world of work, in Design in setting up a design company,
in Engineering in running a project-management services
company, in Nursing in running a Primary Health Care
Trust or being an ‘independent’ midwife.
(C), (D), (E) and (F) in particular relate to university
goals of engaging the community and building business
relationships.
The pursuit of (C) to (F) in particular will demand
active engagement with social and business entrepreneurs, advisory service providers, development organisations and business associations in the region.
However, all of the above need to be delivered in an
‘enterprising’ manner. It can be shown that much of what
is currently delivered in the United Kingdom in business
schools relating to small organisation creation (C) and
(D), for example, is not particularly enterprisingly taught
(see below).

Locating and organising entrepreneurship education
initiatives
(A) and (B) and most probably (C) can only be fully
achieved within departments.
(B) in particular requires the embedding of enterprising pedagogical approaches within the curriculum. It
demands staff recognition, competency, motivation and
a champion for this activity. (C) might emerge in the
form of a number of specific accredited electives. The
development of these might be supported from a central
source. (C) could also, however, be delivered via a

10
(page number not for citation purpose)

partnership between a central and departmental source
and may or may not be academically accredited.
(D) can be offered across the university by a central
source with internal and external partners as noted
above.
(E) and (F) are essentially the domain of careers
services but will also demand partnerships internally
and externally and particularly the engagement of
leaders/entrepreneurs of small organisations.
All of (A) to (F) can be said to be of central concern to
careers and the employability agendas. There are good
examples of careers departments taking substantial crossuniversity initiatives in entrepreneurship education (see,
e.g. the Newcastle University web site www.ncl.ac.uk/
careers/develop/bem.php).

Pedagogy and staff development
All of the above-mentioned potential areas of programme development will demand innovative pedagogical
approaches designed to stimulate and simulate the
practice of entrepreneurial behaviours and the life-world
of the entrepreneurial firm and, therefore, require staff
development. The UK NCEE has set out a number of
associated competencies for students and has developed
educator programmes designed to stimulate staff from
any department in a university to develop entrepreneurial
approaches to their curriculum and programme development. Of particular importance is the simulation of the
entrepreneurial life-world of ownership, intuitive decision
making and risk taking, initiative taking, holistic project
management, ‘know-who’ network development and
relationship management and commitment over time to
see things through (Gibb, 2011).
A major challenge in the above is developing the use of
web-based learning and the linking of programme
delivery and backup to the personal Internet world of
the student. There are a growing number of examples of
virtual learning programmes and centres.

Developing a cross-campus approach?
The notion of developing an approach that embraces the
whole university was initially captured by the Kauffmann
Cross Campus Initiative in the USA (http://www.
kauffmann.org/research-and-policy/entrepreneurship-inamerican-higher-education.aspx). A private but wealthy
foundation provided a number of substantial grants on a
competitive basis to US universities with the aim of
taking the focus of entrepreneurship education away from
business schools (which it claimed from its research had a
poor track record of creating entrepreneurs) and locating
it centrally, with a commitment to embed programmes
across the university and also, importantly leverage the
Kauffmann Foundation grant.

<-----Page 10----->Exploring the synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development

There is probably considerable potential in most universities for enterprise and entrepreneurship education to
be a means for creating greater synergy between, and
therefore adding value to, many areas of existing activity,
including: knowledge exchange and transfer; international
network development; regional development partnership;
student enterprise activity; business school programmes;
college student personal development activity; alumni
liaison; postgraduate student development; business engagement; and career’s ‘future development’ programmes.
This potential can, most probably, only be achieved
through trust-based partnership and will demand committed leadership in this respect. There is probably underdeveloped potential in these respects in many universities.
To realise this potential, there will be a need to find and
support strong champions in faculties/departments to
develop (A) to (C) in particular. This might be done by
offering bursaries for pedagogical/knowledge re-configuration of existing programmes or the development of
new electives. This effort will need to be supported, in
most cases by a central source with experience and
contacts with national and international best practice.
These offers will need to be substantially contextualized
to the culture and curriculum of individual departments
although the development of (C) in particular can be on
the basis of any existing experience in start-up programmes within or without the university. (E) to (F) in
particular will demand great attention given to creating
partnerships between careers, knowledge transfer,
alumni, graduate society initiatives, some business school
and other related activity that has existed hitherto.

Student entrepreneurship initiatives
A potentially powerful tool for student engagement is the
creation of a student entrepreneurship society. The
number of such societies is growing across the United
Kingdom, and there is now a national student-led network
of support through the National Consortium of University Entrepreneurs (NACUE, www.nacue.com). Launched
in 2009, it now has links with over 50 university student
societies. It provides society start-up support, leaders
training, an entrepreneur’s portal, links to investors,
conferences, guides to events and awards programmes
for societies and mentorship programmes. The initiative
has its origins in the success of the Oxford Student
Entrepreneurs’ Society that has several thousand members, a full-time president and a wide range of programmes
and activities as above, including an incubator. Student
societies are in some cases supported financially by the
university: often a key component in their start-up success
is support from university staff champions.

Internationalisation
The internationalisation of higher education is a key part
of the scenario of the entrepreneurial university. It can be

defined as: ‘the process of integrating an international,
intercultural, or global dimension into the purpose,
functions or delivery of education’ (Knight, 2003).
The process brings uncertainty and complexity and
opportunities and threats. It demands a response involving: use of key entrepreneurial attributes such as risk
and initiative taking; the finding and grasping of new
opportunities (Shattock, 2009); the building of new trustbased networks and relationships; holistic project management; flexible strategic planning; and entrepreneurial
leadership (Knight, 2003). The process can also provide
new rewards in terms of income, reputation, research
opportunity, new partnerships and enhanced cultural
understanding. Its operational portfolio includes: new
degrees; franchising of existing degrees; international
student inflow; new campus initiatives; student exchange;
linguistic programmes; faculty mobility and exchange;
research partnerships; and company linkages.

Sharing culture
Perhaps the major challenge of internationalisation is
that of adapting to different cultures. The process
includes ensuring that: the university truly internalises
the learning from international experience; staff adapt to
new cultures of learning and pedagogy (Green & Baer,
2000); and students and staff are enabled to understand
their own culture in a global context and develop
empathy with other cultures. As a result, it is argued:
they learn to communicate more effectively with different
communities (including language development); there is
developed an appreciation of the art, religion and
material philosophy of other cultures; and they gain
knowledge of factors shaping these in a global context
(Morris, 2009).
Staff and student mobility
Mobility of staff and students is at the core of most
university international cooperation. In 2009/2010, for
example, there were 406,000 overseas students studying
in UK higher education institutions (approximately half
in postgraduate education), according to the UK Council
for International Student Affairs: this number had grown
by almost one-third over the previous 5 years. Another
408,000 were in the process of obtaining UK university
qualifications overseas, over one-quarter by distance
learning, Asia being the major focal region. In contrast,
the estimated number of UK students studying abroad
was 22,000, the majority in the USA and the EU. Mobility
is, therefore, considerably biased one way. The same bias is
claimed to exist for staff mobility with approximately
10% of UK university staff being from outside the EU,
although there is no complete detail of UK university staff
serving abroad (International Focus, 2010).
Key issues of UK concern, shared by other EU
countries are: the possible short-term nature of the inflow

of students seeking national degrees; the challenge of
developing more opportunities for students and staff to
study and work abroad in partnership with overseas
institutions; the opportunities for distance learning
partnerships with new technologies; and the provision
of wider opportunities for staff and students to volunteer
for overseas work assignments. Very few universities
operate the last mentioned on any scale (Baskerville,
MacLeod, & Saunders, 2011).

Partnership and network building
In response to the above it has been argued that there is a
strategic shift underway in UK higher education in terms of
international collaborative activities in that it is moving
from a focus upon international student recruitment
towards a forging of long-term, sustainable partnerships
(Baskerville et al., 2011). But, the review, undertaken in
2011 by the UK International and Europe Unit, reveals that
there is a long way to go to catch up with the United States.
Key issues in creating successful partnerships are seen
to be: the existence of a clear strategy and criteria; the
degree of collaborative research; the sustainability of
existing partnerships; quality control; clarity of objectives
as to goals and content of the partnership; mutual
understanding of the relevant regulatory environment;
and a sound financial plan and backing.
Individual academic initiatives often provide the base
for bottom-up internationally collaborative research.
These also can provide the means for building a multidisciplinary focus in tandem with multi-national research.
Such initiatives may also be enhanced by the trend towards
split-site doctoral programmes (Baskerville et al., 2011).
Overseas campus development
The number of universities, globally, establishing campuses overseas is growing, but from a small base. In 2009,
the UK representation was 13 out of a global total of 162
(Lasanowski, 2010) of which almost half were from the
United States. The development is not without risk
in that a small number have failed and others have
not got beyond the negotiation stage. The main drivers
to this trend are: revenue through enhanced student
numbers; staff student mobility; creating visibility and
gaining prestige; anticipating competition; opportunities
for research and the development of new curriculum;
staff development; and securing a student flow to the
home base for higher degrees. Key issues include:
choosing quality partnerships and sustainable commitment; careful assessment of the regulatory environment;
quality control; recruitment of quality local staff (the vast
majority of staff are recruited locally); and sponsorship
on the basis of a sound revenue-generating business plan.
Overseas campus establishments may also offer opportunities for closer engagement with business and local
development agencies.

Organising to build commitment
Based on reviews of performance and practice (Reichart &
Wachter, 2000; Green, 2005; Morris, 2009; AUCC, 2009),
it is possible to identify key factors in pursuing successful
international processes, which include: the building of
truly international faculty; developing appropriate support services for international students; seeking out and
managing dedicated new income streams; creating distinct
budgets and contract formats for overseas work; maximising the opportunity for new worldwide alumni
relationships; developing new forms of distance education
and support; balancing central, departmental and individual initiative appropriately; creating, where appropriate,
new forms of accreditation and assessment; building staff
promotion and reward systems for international effort;
the identification and support of champions; holding
deans and departmental heads responsible; and maximising the potential for enhancing domestic student international experience in anticipation of their operating in
future in a global employment market place (Seitz, 2007).

Conclusion: building a university strategy from
synergistic exploration
The above review has attempted to identify many key issues
to be considered within a framework of entrepreneurial
university development. It should be clear from the review
that there is already a considerable degree of activity
centred on the entrepreneurial concept in the higher
education sector in the United Kingdom and internationally. It should also be clear from the lists of ‘key issues’
under each heading that there is much overlap and therefore potential for synergy. The framework introduced
above can accordingly be used in practice for an ‘audit’
of a wide range of university entrepreneurial activities
many of which often occur in isolated and sometimes
competing (for resource) pockets. Bringing the various
activities together may well reveal that the whole could be
much greater than the sum of the parts. An example of how
exploring one area raises issues for others is provided below
in respect of entrepreneurship education.
A strong university commitment to entrepreneurship
education as described earlier will involve a number of
strategic decisions. One such decision is that of organisation design, namely the degree to which ownership and
practice of concept and delivery should or should not be
embedded in individual departments and what should be
the role of any central support group. Any central
support resource would need to have a degree of
entrepreneurial flexible autonomy. But there will also be
a demand for strong senior leadership from the top in
driving much of the education agenda as described
earlier. A major governance challenge may arise in that
central support units will most probably not be able to
accredit academic entrepreneurship programmes, but
they can, in partnership, contribute substantially to

<-----Page 12----->Exploring the synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development

accredited programmes (as has been done in the past by
linking business schools with other university departments). A research agenda will be created focused on
areas such as needs identification, evaluation, assessment,
programme design and delivery (pedagogy) and best
practice nationally and internationally. This may be
undertaken in partnership with academic and other
professional areas in the university as well as with
external partners, thus potentially involving wide stakeholder participation. Alumni involved in entrepreneurship
activity can be identified and involved. Engaging those
alumni running entrepreneurial organisations overseas
can add considerably to the internationalisation agenda.
There is, however, an even wider perspective. Enterprise/entrepreneurship education ideally needs to be
particularly close to matching careers and employability
agendas even when it is being embedded in departments
(this process is happening in several universities), which
raises the challenge of creating closer internal professional/academic partnerships. For all those concerned,
there will be a need for continued effort to build and
reinforce networks in a region and beyond, so that
resource and experience of good practice elsewhere can
be utilised to bring continuous benefit to the university.
Moreover, there will be major opportunity to partner
with knowledge exchange and transfer activity internally
and business, local development and social enterprise
stakeholders externally. Wherever the location of responsibility, there will be a need to work closely with, and take
leadership in, support of student entrepreneurship societies. There will usually be a major need for staff
development in the delivery of innovative pedagogy and

forms of assessment and for active engagement with
entrepreneurs with an associated ability to offer rewards
and status to those entrepreneurs who engage with the
university in this process. There may also be numerous
transdisciplinary opportunities demanding partnership
between departments. A ‘whole university’ entrepreneurship education initiative may also be fully engaged with
research and doctoral training.
The same kind of exercise to demonstrate the potential
for synergy can be conducted from other ‘activity’ start
points. For example, there is considerable evidence that
‘structural gaps’ in knowledge transfer activity are best
dealt with not solely through sometimes isolated technology transfer office activity but by the creation of a culture
of individual and departmental stakeholder (particularly
entrepreneur) engagement on a regular basis to build
social capital alongside pursuit of risk-taking behaviour
supported by departmental heads.
The framework as shown in Fig. 2 can, overall be used
to re-visit key aspects of the strategy of the university. The
figure sets out the potential for exploring the contribution
of the entrepreneurial concept to such broader strategic
goals of: enhancing innovation, strengthening and building stakeholder relationships, enhancing student employability, improving teaching quality and perhaps, by closer
involvement with entrepreneurs, building more revenue
generating project work as well as enhancing the competitive image of the institution.

Annex 19
Entrepreneur, Enterprise and Innovation
Definitions
In developing a strategy for Entrepreneurship Development in Higher Education, there is often a need to resolve
a conceptual confusion concerning the relationship
between Enterprise, Entrepreneurship and Innovation.
This confusion impacts adversely on efforts to develop
Entrepreneurship Education not only in the HE context
but also across the whole education field.
The Enterprise Concept focuses upon the development
of the ‘Enterprising Person and Entrepreneurial Mindset’. The former constitutes a set of personal skills,
attributes, behavioural and motivational capacities (associated with those of the entrepreneur) but which can be
used in any context (social, work, leisure etc). Prominent
among these are; intuitive decision making, capacity to
make things happen autonomously, networking, initiative
taking, opportunity identification, creative problem solving, strategic thinking, calculated risk taking and self
efficacy). The latter focuses upon creating empathy with
the life-world of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial
ways of doing, thinking, feeling, communicating, organising and learning.
The Entrepreneurship Concept focuses upon the application of these enterprising skills etc. to the setting up a
new venture, developing/growing an existing venture and
designing an entrepreneurial organisation (one in which
the capacity for effective use of enterprising skills will be
enhanced). The context might be business, academy,
social enterprise, NGOs or even public organisations
(e.g. Local Government)
The Innovation Concept is the product of the
above. Innovation is defined as creating and exploiting

opportunities for new ways of doing things resulting in
better products and services, systems and ways of
managing people and organisations. As per Schumpeter,
the successful pursuit of innovation is a function of
individual enterprising endeavour and entrepreneurial
organisation capacity. Innovation is impossible without
these. They are both necessary conditions, sufficient only
when combined with an environment that is conducive
to such activity. Innovation in the university context
can include among other things; new programme development; new innovative pedagogy; new forms of
stakeholder relationship; new alumni developments;
new developments from research; new transdisciplinary
ventures in research and teaching; new partnerships with
business; new international relationships; and new social
enterprise activity.

Annex 2
The University Entrepreneurial Scorecard
(Assessing the Entrepreneurial Capacity of a University)
The Scorecard embraces all of the issues in the paper. It
can be used for a comprehensive analysis of the university
or for a more focused review of a number of key areas of
particular interest to users and exploration of areas of
potential synergy.
It can also be used to test staff awareness of entrepreneurship activity in the university and/or to gain an
impressionistic view of the perceived ‘state of play’.
If the Likert scale is used, then the points can be
connected up to give a visual display of areas of strength
and weakness.
