TO TRUST OR NOT TO TRUST:
SITUATIONAL AND DISPOSITIONAL DETERMINANTS
SHARON G. GOTO
The effects of situational uncertainty, social distance of the target
person, and the actor’s disposition, on the level of trusting behavior
were investigated using a series of scenarios. The results indicate that
measures of dispositional trust can predict specific trusting behaviors,
and that the situational factors interact. Specifically, in situations of
low uncertainty, acquaintance level targets are trusted like intimate
targets. Yet, in situations of high uncertainty acquaintances are trusted
merely as acquaintances. Further, trusting behaviors are more likely to
occur in situations of low uncertainty, and individuals of small social
distance are more likely to be trusted than those of large social
distance. Implications for empirical research requiring subjects’ trust,
group membership, and theories of organizational climate are
discussed.

Although often taken for granted, trust plays an integral role in
one’s daily life. It functions to simplify the world by providing
“shortcuts” that enable individuals to rely on others, freeing them to do
much more than could be done in the absence of trust. These shortcuts
permeate a variety of daily activities, from social adjustment to
business transactions. Erikson (1968) argued that the ability to trust
others is essential for an individual’s adjustment. Samples of the
hardcore unemployable often do not trust others in their chaotic
environments (Triandis, Feldman, & Weldon, 1975). Furthermore,
high trust has been theorized to increase organizational
competitiveness (Ouchi), 1981).
DEFINITIONS OF TRUST
In defining trust, three different components of trust have been
emphasized. Erikson (1950) defined trust as a belief in the goodness of
others or as a healthful personality trait, emphasizing the internal
expectancy as a disposition component. Others emphasized the
situational uncertainty component. For example, Deutsch (1958)
defined trust as occurring when “an individual expects [an event to

TRUST

occur] and the expectation leads to behavior which he perceives to
have greater negative motivational consequence if it is not confirmed
than positive motivational consequence if it is confirmed” (p. 266).
Gambetta (1988) defined trust as “a particular level of the subjective
probability with which an agent assesses that another agent or group of
agents will perform a particular action, both before he can monitor
such action (or independently of his capacity ever to be able to monitor
it) and in a context in which it affects his own action” (p.217). Still
others emphasized the relational component between the actor and the
target; trust as “an assured reliance on the character, strength, or truth
of someone or something” (Merriam-Webster, 1974, p.733) and as
synonymous with cooperation (Bateson, 1988). From this
anthropological viewpoint, the development of cooperation between
animals and humans is essential for gene survival.
TRUST PARADIGMS
Emphasizing different aspects of the definitions, two approaches
have come to dominate the psychological literature on trust; non-zero
sum game research which focused on the component of situational
uncertainty and individual difference research (Schlenker, Helm &
Tedeschi, 1973). Other research has involved source credibility
(Giffin, 1967) and the delay of gratification (reviewed by Mischel,
1966).
SlTUATIONAL UNCERTAINTY
The non-zero sum game approach to studying trust began with
Deutsch and his use of the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (1958). In this
paradigm, the two participants are each offered two alternatives for
action: 1) the cooperative choice offers the possibility for the highest
joint outcome, provided the partner also makes a cooperative choice,
and 2) the competitive choice offers the possibility for the highest
individual outcome, provided the partner makes a cooperative choice.
This creates a dilemma of trust because each player could exploit the
other’s generosity (each person is better off competing no matter what
the other person chooses). However, both players are worse off if they
both compete when they could have trusted and cooperated with each
other (Wrightsman, O’Connor & Baker, 1972). Research on trust using
this paradigm typically involves a manipulation of one or more
situational variables (e.g., face-to-face versus computer-aided tasks)
and an observation of the effects on trust.
DISPOSITIONAL TRUST
Trust has also been studied as a personality trait (Rotter, 1967;
Wrightsman 1964). Rotter’s work, involving the Interpersonal Trust
Scale (1967, 1971), is by far the most extensive and well known within
the trust research. Individuals differ in their expectancies that “the
word, promise, or written statement of another individual or group can
be relied on” (Rotter, 1971, p. 444). To measure this personality
variable, Rotter (1967) developed the Interpersonal Trust Scale (ITS),

<-----Page 2----->TRUST

121

consisting of 25 Likert-type trust items.
There is some question of the ITS’ ability to predict trust in specific
situations. In a test of criterion validity Rotter (1967) found that ITS
scores predicted cheating on an examination in the absence of a
proctor. However, Schlenker, Helm and Tedeschi (1973) found that
women who scored high on the ITS tended to cooperate more on a
mixed-motive conflict task, although the findings were marginal (p<
07).
While the experimental paradigm focused on the effect of
situational uncertainty on trusting behavior or trust as a state, the ITS
focused solely on the dispositional aspects of trust. Further, no relation
was found between responses on the ITS and responses in a Prisoner’s
Dilemma Game (MacDonald, Kessel, & Fuller, 1972). In their study of
the relation between self-disclosure and trust, self-disclosure was
found to be correlated with trust as measured by the Prisoner’s
Dilemma paradigm, but both were not related to the ITS. MacDonald
et al. (1972) posited that the PDG and ITS captured different aspects of
trust.
THE SOCIAL DISTANCE OF THE TARGET
Both of the aforementioned paradigms tend to neglect the
situational role of the specific target in trusting behaviors. Of the
personality theorists, Rotter (1967, 1971) alone mentioned the various
targets of interpersonal trust. In the ITS the social distance of the target
persons remained fairly constant. Of the 25 questions, 23 target
persons of trust were “classes of significant others” (Rotter, 1971, p.
446) falling into the “acquaintance” category (e.g., teachers, judges).
Within the experimental paradigm, subjects were randomly assigned to
one another, or interacted with confederates (e.g., Deutsch, 1958).
Thus, the social distance between the subjects remained fairly large.
The specific target person may heavily influence the likelihood that
a person will engage in trusting behavior if, for instance, previous
transactions between the two people have been successful. Trust may
also rest on the perceived social similarity between the two exchange
partners. Zucker (1986) labelled the former a “process-based” trust and
the latter a “characteristic-based” trust. Social distance can be
conceptualized as the construct underlying many of these determinants
of target-specific trust, such as previous exchanges, perceived social
similarity, and credibility, and as such should be studied with regard to
trust.
In response to a trust literature devoid of specific target persons,
Zhang (1990) developed the Interpersonal Trusting Behavior Scale
(ITBS). The ITBS measured an individual’s trust towards 20 different
target persons with respect to 18 different situations. The 20 different
target persons clustered into three general categories (intimates,
acquaintances, and strangers). Zhang found that intimates were trusted
most, followed by acquaintances, and strangers who were trusted the
least.

<-----Page 3----->122

TRUST

Unfortunately, Zhang’s (1990) study did not take into account
differential levels of situational uncertainty involved in trusting
behaviors. Although different target persons were utilized, the level of
situational uncertainty was not systematically varied across the
scenarios.
THE CONFLUENCE OF SITUATIONAL UNCERTAINTY,
DISPOSITION, AND SOCIAL DISTANCE ON TRUST
The reviewed research focused on the study of three important
determinants of trust; situational uncertainty, disposition, and social
distance. The experimental paradigm (e.g., Deutsch, 1958) focused on
important aspects of situational uncertainty, Rotter (1967) focused on
dispositional trust, and Zhang (1990) focused on the role of the social
distance of the target on decisions to trust. Yet, the research on trust
has failed to investigate systematically the confluence of these factors
affecting trust.
First, the conceptual independence of the environmental factors
must be clarified. It is risky to lend a total stranger $100 for several
reasons. Situational uncertainty could be based on either the
relationship or lack thereof between the actors (social distance), or the
uncertainty of repayment when lending the large amount of $100.
Situational uncertainty is presently defined as the potential loss to the
actor resulting from trust (i.e., $100), thereby conceptually separating
the effects of social distance between the actor and target. Nonetheless,
the interaction of the two environmental variables is plausible:
Hypothesis 1: a two-way, situational uncertainty by social distance
interaction is hypothesized, such that in situations of low uncertainty
the effects of the social distance between the actor and the target
person will be less important in determining interpersonal trust than in
situations of high uncertainty.
In explaining the only marginally significant relations between
dispositional trust and specific acts of trusting behavior (Schlenker,
Helm & Tedeschi, 1973), it is plausible that disposition and situational
variables interact:
Hypothesis 2: A two-way dispositional trust by social distance
interaction is hypothesized; low dispositional trust individuals will be
more influenced by the social distance of the target person when
deciding whether to trust another individual than high dispositional
trust individuals will be.
Hypothesis 3: A two-way dispositional trust by situational
uncertainty interaction is hypothesized; low dispositional trust
individuals will also be more influenced by the level of situational
uncertainty than their high dispositional trust counterparts will be.

Champaign participated in the study in exchange for course credit. The
responses of four subjects were omitted for failing to follow directions,
leaving 125 respondents (68 males, 57 females).
MATERIALS
(a) Scenarios. Three different target persons (intimate, acquaintance,
stranger) were crossed with two levels of situational uncertainty (low,
high) to create 24 scenarios. These six conditions were then crossed
with the four behavioral situations that were developed to represent
trust across four of Spranger’s (1928) dimensions of life (aesthetic,
intellectual, economic, and social). Scenarios representing the four
dimensions were generated to attain results that are generalizable
across different situations.
i) Social Distance. The first factor, social distance of the target
person, consisted of three levels (intimate, acquaintance, and stranger).
These three levels and their exemplars were taken from a cluster
analysis in Zhang’s (1990) target specific trust study and were also
cross-culturally validated. Examples of the intimate level of social
distance are “boy/girl friend”, “mother” and “brother”. “neighbor” and
“classmate” exemplify the acquaintance level and examples of the
stranger classification are “strangers” and “peddlers”. The specific
target person within each level of social distance varied across
dimensions of life to make the target person a realistic actor in the
situation.
ii) Situational Uncertainty This second factor consisted of two
levels: high and low situational uncertainty. The type of uncertainty
entailed in the trusting behavior was contingent on the specific
scenario. For example, in the economic scenario, level of uncertainty
was varied by manipulating the amount of money to be lent. The
specific amount of uncertainty that represented the low and high
conditions for each scenario (e.g., lending one dollar versus onehundred dollars) was pre-tested.1 A question asking about the
uncertainty of the situation (7-point scale) accompanied each scenario,
and served as a manipulation check for this factor.
iii) Measures of Dispositional Trust. In an effort to attain a measure
of dispositional trust devoid of much context, a general measure of
dispositional trust was used rather than the ITS which contains many
situational influences.
1

Eleven graduate students determined what constituted an appropriate
level of high and low risk for each situation. An attempt was made to keep the
level of risk equivalent across domains.

<-----Page 5----->124

TRUST

The subjects were asked to indicate on a 7-point trustworthy
/untrustworthy scale, “In general, how trustworthy is [a specific target
person]”. Responses were elicited for the ten different target persons
who appeared in the trust vignettes and varied from intimate (i) to
acquaintance (a) to stranger (s). ‘Stranger’, ‘banker’, and ‘fellow
traveler’ belonged to the stranger category. ‘Old high school
classmate’, ‘colleague of yours’, ‘classmate’, and ‘neighbor’ were
exemplars of the acquaintance category. Intimates targets were ‘best
friend’, ‘brother’, and ‘boy/ girlfriend’.
The study design was a 3 (level of social distance) X 2 (level of
situational uncertainty) X 2 (level of dispositional trust) mixed
factorial design, with the first two factors as repeated measures and
disposition as a between-subjects variable. That is, six specific
situations (low situational uncertainty with intimate, acquaintance,
stranger, and high situational uncertainty with intimate, acquaintance,
and stranger) were generated for each life dimension (i.e., social,
economic, aesthetic, and intellectual). Each subject responded to all of
the following six situations across all domains:
(1) “During a vacation, a (FELLOW TRAVELER, OLD HIGH
SCHOOL CLASSMATE, BOY/GIRL FRIEND) introduces you
to an exotic food of Central America. He reassures you that the
food is the most wonderful taste in the world. He warns you that
there is one chance in a (THOUSAND, MILLION) that the food
may be contaminated and this would make you seriously ill.”
[aesthetic];
(2) “You are writing a paper for a sociology class that requires
research in an unfamiliar section of the city where the
newspapers reported that there were (ONE, FIFTEEN)
mugging(s) within the last week. Your (STRANGER,
NEIGHBOR, BEST FRIEND) who has been to the area before
and knows the neighborhood fairly well offers to be your
guide.” [intellectual];
(3) “Over the years you have accumulated savings of about
(ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS) that you hope to use for a trip to Europe. A
(BANKER, COLLEAGUE, BEST FRIEND) whom you have
recently met at a cocktail party advises you to invest your
savings in some stock. The return rate on your investment could
be FIFTY% and there is a SUBSTANTIAL chance that you
could lose part of your initial investment.” [economic]
(4) “Your (WELL DRESSED STRANGER, CLASSMATE,
BROTHER) accompanies you to the airport and asks to borrow
(ONE DOLLAR, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS) from you so
that he can take a taxi-ride to a city that is forty miles away.”
[social]

(b). Counterbalancing the Order of Presentation.
Questions were counterbalanced in an effort to eliminate potential
confounds such as practice effects by creating two forms of the
questionnaire. In form one, all 24 scenarios appeared in completely
random order. This order was then halved (part a and b) and reordered
such that in form two part b was followed by part a. Analyses revealed
no order by treatment interactions (order by social distance,
F(2,242)<2; order by disposition, F(1,212)<1; order by risk,
F(1,211)<4 all non-significant).
(c). Dependent Variables.
Measures of Behavioral Trust. The dependent measures tapped the
individual’s likelihood of performing the trusting behavior on a 7-point
(likely +3/unlikely -3) scale. For the aesthetic domain, the dependent
variable was, “What is the likelihood that you will try the exotic
food?”. For the intellectual domain, the dependent variable was, “What
is the likelihood that you will make the investment?”. The questions,
“What is the likelihood that you will lend him/her the money?” and
“What is the likelihood that you will ask him to be your guide?” served
as dependent measures for the economic and social domains,
respectively. As in the ITS, implicit in the dependent variables is the
problem of whether or not to trust the people in the situations.2
RESULTS
SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION INTO HIGH VERSUS LOW
DISPOSITIONAL TRUST.
The general dispositional trust measure (standardized alpha = .78)
was found to be significantly correlated with the ITS (r =.48, p <.10) in
a pilot study of 47 subjects. Subjects were classified as either high or
low in dispositional trust by taking a median split of the subjects’
scores on the general trust measure. This separated the subjects into
two categories; high trusters (n=59), and low trusters (n=64).

Measures of Private Acceptance Trust. People may display trusting behavior
based on normative obligations rather than actual trust. Measures tapping the
extent to which the target persons are believable were included to complement
the behavioral measures of trust. For example, in the social domain the
question, “What is the likelihood that he will repay you?” complements the
questions which ask the likelihood that the subject will behave trustingly (i.e.,
lend the money). In three of the four domains, (aesthetic, monetary,
intellectual) the behavioral and belief-based dependent measures of trust were
positively correlated across the six conditions (situational uncertainty by
social distance), p<.01.

As expected, the high uncertainty situations were perceived as more
uncertain than the low uncertainty situations.
COMPOSITE SCORES OF BEHAVIORAL TRUST DEPENDENT
MEASURES
Six composite scores representing the three levels of social distance
and two levels of situational uncertainty across domains were created
to ensure generalizability and improve power. For instance, measures
of behavioral trust for the low risk-intimate social distance condition
were averaged across the aesthetic, intellectual, economic and social
domains. The same procedure was followed for the remaining five
conditions. Measures of reliability were reasonable considering the
heterogeneity of the situational domains (see Table 1).

THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DISTANCE, SITUATIONAL
UNCERTAINTY, AND DISPOSITION ON TRUST3
The composite behavioral trust scores in the 3 (social distance) x 2
(situational uncertainty) x 2 (dispositional trust) design were analyzed
using multivariate analysis of variance procedures.
An interaction between the two environmental factors of trust
emerged. The situational uncertainty x social distance interaction,
hypothesis 1, was significant (F(2,122)=32.28, p<.001). Follow-up
analysis revealed simple effects for social distance in both the low risk
condition, F(2, 123=364.48; p<.001) and in the high risk condition,

An analysis of dispositional trust using extreme scores (trichotomizing the
disposition of general trust scores, and discarding those subjects falling within
the 33.3 and 66.7 percentiles) actually yields more pronounced effects for the
disposition factor.

F(2,123=182.82; p< 001). Intimate targets (Mlow =1.80; Mhi=.94) were
trusted more than acquaintances (Mlow=1.35; Mhi=-.07) and strangers
(Mlow=.01; Mhi= -1.41), respectively. Furthermore, simple comparisons
within the low risk condition show a large difference between trust
towards strangers relative to intimate and acquaintance targets,
F(2,248)=206.90; p<.001, with the difference between intimate and
acquaintance targets remaining significant, F(1, 124)=46.40; p<.001. It
seems that in situations of low uncertainty, acquaintances are trusted
more like intimate targets. However, a sharper distinction was drawn
between intimates and acquaintances under situations of high
uncertainty (see Figure 1).
Dispositional trust did not interact with any of the other factors. The
three-way, disposition x social distance x situational uncertainty
interaction failed to reach significance, (F(2,122)=2), as did hypothesis
2: disposition x social distance interaction (F(2,122)<1, ns), and
hypothesis 3: disposition x situational uncertainty interaction
(F(1,123)<1, ns).

<-----Page 9----->128

TRUST

A main effect for dispositional trust was found. Subjects who were
low in dispositional trust (M=.20) were less likely to trust others than
those high in dispositional trust (M=.70), F(1,123)=11.14; p<.001. A
partial omega squared (Keppel, 1991) was calculated as an estimate of
treatment magnitude (omega2=.04), revealing that dispositional trust
accounted for four percent of the total variance.
Significant effects for social distance, and situational uncertainty,
were also obtained. Intimate targets (M=1.37) were trusted most of all,
followed by acquaintances (M=.64), and strangers (M=-.70),
F(2,246)=508.73, p<.001 Subjects were less likely to trust others in
situations of high uncertainty (M=-.18) than in low uncertainty
situations (M=1.05), F(1,123)=303.99; p<.001.
The breakdown of effects and interactions by domain (see Table 2)
parallel the results based on the composite scores with the exception of
an absent main effect for social distance in the economic domain, and
the absent main effect for situational uncertainty in the intellectual
domain.

DISCUSSION
The hypothesized situational uncertainty by social distance
interaction received support. However, the hypothesized interactions
between dispositional trust and the situational variables were not
supported.
HYPOTHESIS 1:
High situational uncertainty seems to adversely change perceptions
of the actor’s relationship with the target. When little situational
uncertainty is involved, acquaintances seem almost as trustworthy as
intimates. However, with higher stakes involved, acquaintances are
seen merely as acquaintances.
The finding suggests that being perceived as a stranger is an
unforgiving status. Acquaintances can be perceived to be more
trustworthy in situations of low uncertainty, thus reaping the benefits
of cooperation and credibility as an intimate. However, strangers will
be trusted as strangers, regardless of the situational uncertainty.
Further, several implications are yielded. For example, in exclusive
groups where membership is given only to intimately known persons,
the additional presence of a high degree of situational uncertainty in
the task should create an environment that maintains the exclusion of
out-group members. Reducing the level of situational uncertainty
might serve to increase the level of trust of acquaintances as intimates,
and could expand membership by accepting acquaintances into the
group. Perhaps an increase in trust underlies the effectiveness of
superordinate goals in increasing intergroup attractiveness (Sherif &
Sherif, 1969). The presence of a superordinate goal may serve to
reduce situational uncertainty, creating an environment of reduced
social distances between group members. The level of trust between
group members may increase, leading to improved intergroup
attitudes.
HYPOTHESES 2 & 3
No support was lent to the hypotheses that low dispositional trust
individuals would be more influenced by factors of situational
uncertainty and social distance than their high dispositional trust
counterparts. Situational cues seem equally important and independent
of dispositional trust in both populations.
The main effect for disposition supports previous work by Rotter
(1967), and refutes findings by others (MacDonald, Kessel, & Fuller,
1972; Schlenker, Helm, & Tedeschi, 1973) who found dispositional
trust to predict at best only marginally specific trusting behaviors.
However, the small amount of variance accounted for by disposition
lends itself to the power of the situation or state trust. Ross and Nisbett
(1991) argue that the construal of the situation by an individual is an
active process resulting in “inherent variability” and “very large
behavioral differences” (Ross & Nisbett, 1991; p. 46). With respect to
trust, the situation is powerful.

<-----Page 11----->130

TRUST

Finally, the level of behavioral trust was highest towards targets of
small social distance (intimates) and lowest towards targets of large
social distance (strangers), thus the findings of Zhang (1990) were
replicated. Further, the level of behavioral trust was higher in
situations of low risk rather than high risk, replicating game theory
findings using paper and pencil measures of trust.
CONCLUSION
Future trust theory and research should incorporate the roles of
disposition and environment in trusting behavior. For example,
theories and empirical studies of organizational trust (e.g., Theory Z;
Ouchi, 1981) may be refined for a better understanding of the
importance of trust in and across organizations. The higher level of
trust of the Japanese organization may be due to the situational
uncertainty of the organizations, the closer relationship between
Japanese co-workers, or a more trusting disposition of the Japanese.
Each of these would carry very different ramifications for attempts to
improve the climates of American corporations using Japanese models.
In experimental settings, the effects of the relationships between
subjects, and the level of uncertainty involved in the study may affect
research in any study requiring the trust of the subject. One or more
factors of trust may interact with the variables of interest, thus
distorting results.
Other factors may be of importance as well. By manipulating the
different components of trust across a larger variety of domains (e.g.,
intellectual), we may find the importance of specific components of
trust to be contingent on the given domain. Unfortunately, it is
impossible to rule out the possible idiosyncratic effects of the scenarios
(e.g., the airport environment) within the confines of this study. This is
a future direction of exploration.
Although many issues remain for future study, this study yielded
numerous implications for theory and experimental research involving
trust; the effects of situational uncertainty, social distance of the target,
and disposition should not be neglected.
