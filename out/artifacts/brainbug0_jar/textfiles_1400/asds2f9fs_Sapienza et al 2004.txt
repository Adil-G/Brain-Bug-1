Abstract
In this article, we examine the effects of knowledge relatedness on the post-spin-off growth of firms
spun off from industrial parent firms. We predict that growth is maximized when the knowledge base
of the spin-off firm partially overlaps with that of its parent. This effect is due to learning: both too
small and too great an overlap will inhibit growth, the first because limited knowledge overlap
hampers local search and knowledge assimilation and the second because great knowledge overlap
hampers the creation of novel knowledge combinations. The propositions are tested and confirmed
using a sample of 54 industrial spin-off firms from Finland.

of knowledge by tapping into the resource base of their partners. Knowledge combination
may lead to the development of new products or improvement of production and marketing
processes. In other words, learning in interorganizational relationships may translate into a
significant competitive advantage for young firms and an engine for their growth.
In this article, we focus on learning in the relationship between a spin-off firm and its
parent. In particular, we investigate the impact of knowledge overlap on growth of the spinoff firm. We suggest that the more efficient a spin-off firm’s learning from its parent, the more
rapid will be the accumulation of knowledge in the spin-off firm, resulting in faster post-spinoff growth. The efficiency of learning will be regulated by the degree to which there is
overlap between the knowledge bases of the two firms involved in the learning relationship.
Minimal knowledge relatedness (no or little overlap between the knowledge bases of the
firms) hampers learning because assimilation of knowledge suffers. Extreme knowledge
relatedness (i.e., very high overlap between the knowledge bases of the two firms) hampers
learning because the potential for novel knowledge combinations is reduced. As a result,
learning should be a curvilinear function of the knowledge relatedness between the knowledge bases of the respective firms. This effect should be manifested in the spin-off firm’s
growth, as a curvilinear function of knowledge relatedness. Our study confirmed this
hypothesis by showing that medium levels of technology knowledge relatedness and
production knowledge relatedness produce the highest levels of post-spin-off growth.
Our results highlight the value of knowledge overlap in an inter- and intraorganizational
relationship. However, it seems that there can be too much of a good thing—i.e., beyond a
point of knowledge overlap, little additional knowledge is generated through interaction and
may actually hamper progress. Nonetheless, the results do suggest that ventures with diverse
knowledge bases may expect to learn from one another through collaboration as long as there
is some knowledge overlap, and such learning may result in such tangible outcomes as
growth.
This study addresses a significant gap in existing literature by providing empirical
evidence of the relationship between knowledge relatedness and performance in internal
corporate ventures and spin-off firms. Past evidence has been inconsistent. Much of the
received diversification research has predicted linear performance effects of market competition synergies, production synergies, and technological synergies, but results have been
mixed. Our results help to identify a possible cause of past inconsistent results and hence may
reinvigorate knowledge-based investigations of inter- and intrafirm knowledge transfer.

2. Introduction
For young firms, the race for survival and growth is very much a race for learning.
Learning results in the accumulation of distinctive firm-specific knowledge, which in itself
constitutes a driving resource for growth (Penrose, 1959; Spender and Grant, 1996; Zahra et
al., 2002). As organizational learning is largely driven by knowledge combination, a young
firm needs to become efficient in combining and assimilating diverse items of externally
sourced knowledge with its internal knowledge base (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Cohen and

<-----Page 2----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

811

Levinthal, 1990). To achieve this and to grow, young firms need to establish learning
relationships with external sources of knowledge (Powell et al., 1996; Liebeskind, 1996;
Zahra and George, 2002).
In this article, we apply the knowledge-based and learning views of the firm to examine the
influence of knowledge overlap between the spin-off firm and its parent company on the
growth of the spin-off firm due to learning from the parent. We suggest that the more efficient
a spin-off firm’s learning from its parent, the more rapid will be the accumulation of
knowledge in the spin-off firm, and the faster its post-spin-off growth. The efficiency of
learning will be regulated by the degree to which there is an overlap between the knowledge
bases of the two firms involved in the learning relationship. We predict that the growth of the
spin-off firm is maximized when the overlap of its knowledge base with that of its parent is
partial. Both too small and too great an overlap with the parent will inhibit the spin-off’s
growth due to learning: insufficient knowledge overlap hampers the assimilation of external
knowledge, whereas excessive knowledge overlap hampers the creation of new knowledge
through knowledge combination.
This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on
the relationship between knowledge relatedness and performance of spin-off firms. Past
evidence has been inconsistent. One past study found a negative relationship between
relatedness and post-spin-off sales growth (Woo et al., 1989). Others have reported positive
relationships between overall relatedness and profitability (Woo et al., 1992; Mahajan and
Wind, 1988; Pitts and Hopkins, 1982), technological relatedness and sales growth (Doutriaux,
1992; Cooper and Bruno, 1977; Feeser and Willard, 1989), marketing relatedness and
financial success (Roberts and Berry, 1985; Sykes, 1986), and production complementarities
and profitability (Davis et al., 1992). Further, some studies have found no relationship
between either relatedness and sales growth (Lindholm, 1994; Woo et al., 1992) or relatedness and market share (Sorrentino and Williams, 1995).
While clearly much of the past inconsistency results from design and measurement
variations, our study suggests that at least part of the confusion may be attributable to the
prior assumption that the relationship between resource sharing and performance is linear.
Recent studies using learning and knowledge-based theory have demonstrated the value of
the theories explaining nonlinear relationships between knowledge elements and organizational performance (e.g., Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1999; Palich et al., 2000). However, few
such attempts have been undertaken thus far because of the inherent measurement difficulties
in knowledge-based research (Spender and Grant, 1996). This study contributes to the
literature by developing the theoretical connection between knowledge relatedness (defined
here as the degree to which the knowledge base of the spin-off firm overlaps with that of its
parent company) and post-spin-off firm growth and by rigorously testing these ideas in a
dynamic field setting.
Our propositions are tested using a sample of industrial spin-off firms in Finland. We focus
on the relationship between a spin-off firm and its parent company because this is the external
relationship in which the most significant learning is likely to occur for such firms (Autio,
1994; Roberts, 1991). Furthermore, the use of Finland as a setting provided a degree of
homogeneity not possible in larger, more diverse markets (Autio et al., 2000). The 54 sample

<-----Page 3----->812

firms are all recently spun out and represent a variety of industry sectors. The predicted
relationships are generally supported in the empirical data.

3. Knowledge and growth
According to Penrose (1959), the growth of firms is driven by firms’ knowledge and
physical resources. The accumulation of knowledge and excess resources, either through the
creation of new knowledge and resources or through learning to use the existing resource
base more efficiently (i.e., the creation of organizational slack), opens new ‘‘productive
possibilities’’ for the firm. Of the productive possibilities, only few will represent feasible
growth opportunities for the firm because of the inherent rigidities and inertia of its existing
resource base, and because the firm needs to maintain coherence in its activities (Ghoshal and
Moran, 1998). The rate of growth of the firm will be limited by the speed with which new
knowledge and resources are accumulated, and by the speed with which the firm’s management learns to accommodate the expanding scope of operations. In Penrose’s theory,
therefore, knowledge and learning are seen as central factors driving firm growth.
While learning from the firm’s operations and internal resource base represents predominantly internal learning that contributes to the creation of organizational slack, learning from
sources external to the firm is important for new knowledge combinations, and thus, for the
creation of new growth opportunities (Amburgey et al., 1993; Zahra et al., 2002). Hence, we
may expect external learning through interorganizational relationships to be of particular
importance for young, resource-constrained entrepreneurial firms (Stevenson and Gumpert,
1985; Shan et al., 1994; McGee and Dowling, 1994; Yli-Renko et al., 2001). In the following,
we lay out our theoretical framework on knowledge relatedness and growth in industrial spinoff firms.
3.1. Knowledge relatedness and learning
Learning theories suggest that knowledge held in common is important for the firm’s
absorptive capacity, and therefore, for efficient learning and new knowledge generation from
sources external to the firm (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Related knowledge (i.e., knowledge
held in common) enhances the ability of the firm to evaluate effectively the value of external
knowledge, to discard irrelevant knowledge, and to concentrate its learning efforts on
valuable knowledge sources (Grant, 1996). To deal with the inflow of information, the
spin-off firm needs to develop information filters for identifying valuable knowledge and
rejecting irrelevant knowledge (Henderson and Clark, 1990). Such filters are built via existing
operations and are best suited to processing and using knowledge similar to that from which
they were built. Therefore, firms learn most efficiently close to their existing knowledge
domains. Local optimization contributes to a higher operational efficiency (Levinthal, 1997).
In short, up to some point, increases in knowledge overlap with the parent company should
increase the productive capacity of the spin-off firm, thereby enhancing its potential for
growth.

<-----Page 4----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

813

Related knowledge also contributes to the efficiency of communicating external knowledge from the parent company and of assimilating it into the spin-off firm’s knowledge base
(Grant, 1996; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). According to Grant (1996, p. 117), for the
transfer of knowledge to occur, those exchanging information must possess shared language,
codes, and symbols: ‘‘The higher the level and sophistication of common knowledge among
the team, whether in the form of language, shared meaning, or mutual recognition of
knowledge domains, the more efficient is integration likely to be.’’ If external knowledge is
closely related to the previously held knowledge in the organization, its communication will
be smoother and face less resistance. Closely related external knowledge resonates with the
organization’s established beliefs about relationships between the firm’s actions and the
outcomes of those actions, thereby enhancing its acceptance within the receiving organization. Because closely related external knowledge is also likely to be more compatible than
unrelated knowledge with the organization’s existing systems, it will be incorporated more
efficiently with these. For example, it is easier for the company to absorb production process
knowledge inputs that are similar to its experiential knowledge on its internal production
systems. Similarly, knowledge about ‘‘what works’’ in marketing is more likely absorbed if it
resonates closely with the firm’s own experience; e.g., a payment scheme innovation will
more readily be incorporated by a firm expert in pricing tactics than one focused solely on
channel selection tactics. External knowledge about the best technological solutions is more
willingly received if the firm has made similar technological choices in its own past. In short,
up to some point, increases in the knowledge overlap between the spin-off firm and its parent
should result in greater integration of externally sourced new knowledge from the parent into
the spin-off firm, thereby contributing to its growth.
Above, we have discussed the effects of prior related knowledge on local search and
knowledge assimilation. However, knowledge not held in common is also important for
learning and growth because new knowledge is created through combinations of existing
knowledge with new items (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Liebeskind, 1996; Zahra et al., 2002;
Zahra and George, 2002). The more different the combined knowledge items, the greater the
novelty value of the created new knowledge. On this basis, Cohen and Levinthal (1990)
suggested that knowledge diversity contributes to learning by enabling individuals to make
new associations between apparently unrelated knowledge items. As the amount of related
knowledge increases and unrelated knowledge diminishes, the potential for new knowledge
creation will be diminished. A very high overlap between the spin-off firm’s knowledge base
with that of its parent company means that the knowledge base of the spin-off becomes
redundant in relation to its parent firm, hurting its ability to create novel combinations based
on external knowledge outsourced from its parent. As many modern technologies represent
fusions or combinations of different technologies discovered at different sectors and different
points in time, excessive knowledge overlap will therefore be harmful for technological
learning and innovation (Katila, 2002; Fleming, 2001).
A great degree of overlap among values, systems, and accepted beliefs may also reduce the
willingness of the spin-off firm to challenge critical assumptions and to discover novel
solutions to existing problems. An important part of an organization’s knowledge is
constituted by established beliefs about ‘‘how things work’’ or relationships between actions

<-----Page 5----->814

H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

and the outcomes that those actions generate (Nonaka, 1994). The greater the number of
beliefs that are shared by the spin-off and its parent, the smaller will be the likelihood that
conflicting knowledge inputs will result in a change of those jointly held organizational
beliefs (March, 1991). In short, an excessive overlap of the knowledge base of the spin-off
firm with its parent may diminish learning by hurting the ability of the spin-off firm to create
novel combinations based on external knowledge sourced from its parent. This translates into
reduced potential for innovation-driven growth in the spin-off firm.
In summary, it appears that both related knowledge and unrelated knowledge are
necessary for learning and growth. However, if the size of knowledge base is held constant,
increases in knowledge overlap with the parent firm represent decreases in the spin-off firm’s
unrelated knowledge in relation to the parent. If the overlap between the knowledge bases of
two firms is complete, knowledge unrelatedness in the relationship between such firms will
be zero. Conversely, knowledge diversity is maximized when no overlap exists between their
respective knowledge bases, i.e., when their knowledge bases are completely unrelated. Our
foregoing arguments have implied that increasing knowledge overlap up to a point will
increase a spin-off firm’s learning and growth potential; however, beyond some optimal point
further increases in knowledge overlap (i.e., decreases in unrelated knowledge) will diminish
the spin-off firm’s ability to create new knowledge necessary for growth. Indeed, Zahra and
George’s (2002) reconceptualization of absorptive capacity emphasizes the importance of
both complementary and diverse knowledge for the creation of a dynamic capability that can
lead to increased profitability and sales growth, among other types of superior performance.
Such a mixture exists at intermediate levels of knowledge relatedness.
3.2. Types of knowledge relatedness and spin-off growth
Because knowledge relatedness between the spin-off firm and the parent firm affects the
speed and novelty of the spin-off firm’s learning, it will affect the ability of the spin-off firm
to realize future sales growth (Autio et al., 2000; Penrose, 1959). Areas of knowledge
relatedness critical to growth include production, technology, and marketing (Rumelt, 1974).
Production knowledge affects sales growth because it involves the ability of spin-offs to meet
variations in demand level and changes in customer specifications. A spin-off will be able to
learn about production techniques to the extent that it shares some production knowledge
with the parent firm. This knowledge will be valuable in helping spin-offs to realize sales by
providing them techniques for meeting demand rather than losing sales to more efficient
competitors. Similarly, spin-offs can learn techniques from the parent firm for efficient and
effective customization of production. This knowledge will not only allow them to meet the
changing demands of their current customers but will also allow them to increase sales by
reaching new customer groups.
To the extent that the spin-off firm shares some technological knowledge with its parent, it
will be able to augment its technological knowledge base by learning from its parent. A solid
technological knowledge base will allow the spin-off firm to design products that offer greater
technological performance than already available in the market, allowing it to either charge
higher sales price or to increase the volume of sales because of superior cost-to-performance

<-----Page 6----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

815

ratio. A solid technological knowledge base will also allow the spin-off firm to cut the
development time from product idea to commercial product, thereby helping it generate sales
earlier. Superior product development efficiency will also enable the spin-off firm to introduce a
greater variety of products, thereby allowing it to reach more customer groups. Indeed, Zahra et
al. (2002) provided some empirical evidence for these arguments by showing that technological
learning was positively related to sales growth in new internationalizing firms.
Marketing knowledge affects sales growth because it enables the spin-off firm to identify the
customer groups that offer the greatest sales potential and because it enables the spin-off firm to
design and implement more effective marketing strategies. To the extent that the spin-off firm
shares some knowledge with its parent company about customer groups, distribution channels,
and marketing strategies and expertise, it will be able to strengthen its marketing competencies
by learning from its parent company. A greater depth of knowledge on customer groups will
allow the spin-off firm to position and price its products optimally for maximum sales and to
target the best customers. A firm’s knowledge of appropriate distribution channels, and of how
to get access to these, will further enhance its ability to increase sales.
Above, we argued for a relationship between three types of organizational knowledge and
spin-off firm sales. Because both related knowledge and unrelated knowledge are required for
organizational learning, learning in an interorganizational relationship should be a curvilinear
function of the knowledge relatedness between the knowledge bases of the respective firms.
Minimal knowledge relatedness (no overlap between the knowledge bases of the firms)
hampers learning because local search and assimilation suffers. Extreme knowledge relatedness (i.e., very high overlap between the knowledge bases of the two firms) hampers learning
because the potential for novel knowledge combinations is reduced. To sum up, the
relationship between knowledge relatedness and learning should be an inverted U-shaped
function (\). Such a relationship was anticipated (but not empirically tested) by Cohen and
Levinthal (1990, p. 134): ‘‘While common knowledge improves communication, commonality should not be carried so far that diversity across individuals is substantially diminished.’’
Therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1: Sales growth in high tech spin-offs will be a curvilinear \-function of
production knowledge relatedness between the spin-off and the parent.
Hypothesis 2: Sales growth in high tech spin-offs will be a curvilinear \-function of
technological knowledge relatedness between the spin-off and the parent.
Hypothesis 3: Sales growth in high tech spin-offs will be a curvilinear \-function of
marketing knowledge relatedness between the spin-off and the parent.

4. Method
The influence of learning on growth should be particularly direct in young firms, who
often need to access external sources to grow. However, the hypotheses present several
challenges for empirical testing. First, young firms often establish relationships with several

<-----Page 7----->816

H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

other firms: customers, suppliers, and other young firms. Learning takes place simultaneously
in several such relationships, potentially clouding the predicted effect in any one dyadic
relationship. Second, in practice, it is difficult to accurately assess the relatedness of a firm’s
knowledge base with that of other firms. This difficulty threatens the reliability and validity of
such assessments. Third, a young firm may not have any one relationship in which intense
learning takes place.
Mindful of such challenges, we have focused our empirical study on young industrial spinoff firms that have been spun off from other industrial firms. Previous research has shown that
of the various relationships that young firms may have with external organizations, the
relationship between a spin-off firm and its incubating organization is one in which
particularly intense learning is likely to take place. In his several studies of MIT spin-off
firms, Roberts (1991) has shown that the transfer of technology from MIT to its spin-off firms
is often intense and likely to continue even after the firm has been established. Similarly,
Autio (1994) reported intense technology transfer from Finnish universities to their spin-off
firms, showing that the incubating organization was the most important single external source
of learning for such firms and that the intensity of this transfer gradually declined as the spinoff firm grew older. It seems reasonable to expect similarly intense learning to take place
between industrial spin-off firms and their parent firms, because such a dyad can be used to
exchange production and marketing knowledge in addition to technological knowledge.
Conversely, given the limited business expertise of universities, learning in a relationship
between an academic spin-off firm and its parent is likely to be largely constrained to the
exchange of technological knowledge.
By focusing our study on the relationship between industrial spin-off firms and their parent
firms, we are also able to reduce problems involved in the assessment of the relatedness of the
knowledge bases of two firms. By definition, the founders of an industrial spin-off firm will
have worked with the parent firm, and therefore they should be able to reliably assess the
relatedness of the production, technological, and marketing knowledge of their own venture
and its parent. While the relationship between an industrial spin-off firm and its parent firm is
likely to be biased toward the high commonality end of the knowledge commonality–
diversity continuum, sufficient knowledge diversity should also be present in such a
relationship, because spin-off firms are often established to pursue business ideas and
commercialize development projects that are peripheral to the core activities of the parent
firm (Burgelman, 1984).
4.1. Sample
Since no existing database contained complete information of technology-related ownership changes through spin-off arrangements, several sources were used to identify such
spin-off firms. First, potential spin-off firms were identified via the Talouselämä business
weekly database. This database fairly comprehensively records business ownership transactions in Finnish firms; however, transactions smaller than 3 million Finnish markka
(MFIM; 6.22 FIM c US$1) are not systematically included in the database. Therefore,
managers of the largest Finnish industrial firms, as well as venture capitalists, were

<-----Page 8----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

817

contacted to identify additional spin-off companies. These searches yielded 129 cases for
further analysis.
To be a technology-related spin-off firm, the firm had to exploit technological competencies developed internally within the parent firm and to be active in industrial manufacturing or in technical services. We also chose to exclude spin-off firms that had been founded
prior to 1987. In addition to our focus on young spin-off firms, the recall of events older than
10 years would have posed difficulty for the interviewees. We also excluded corporate
divestments (defined as a sell-off in which a corporation sells a business unit to another
corporation), our focus being on interorganizational relationships between independent firms.
A spin-off firm was considered independent if less than 50% of its stock was owned by other
corporations. These criteria eliminated 64 of 129 potential cases. From the remaining 62
cases, 54 were personally interviewed in interviews of 1–3 hours. In total, we have a
participation percentage of 87% of the qualified population of industrial spin-off firms in
Finland. The respondents were CEOs of spin-off firms who had been working for the spin-off
from the moment the venture was initiated.
The 54 spin-off firms originated from 23 parent firms and operated in 7 industry sectors:
chemicals, information technology, rubber and plastics, metals and machinery, electrical and
optical equipment, transportation equipment, and printing and publishing. On average, the
spin-off firms had operated independently for 5 years at the time of the interview, and they
averaged 112 employees and 146 MFIM (US$23.5 million) annual sales.
4.2. Dependent variable
Post spin-off growth was operationalized by measuring sales in 1997 in comparison to
sales at the time of spin-off. We corrected for serial correlation by controlling for sales at the
time of separation and for the amount of time the spin-off firm as an independent organizational entity. Sales at the time of the separation refers to the sales the venture generated within
the parent firm 1 year prior to its separation from the parent organization. Thus, we are
comparing the sales the venture generated as an internal corporate venture to the sales it
generated as an independent company in 1997. Alternatively, we could have measured postspin-off growth as absolute or relative difference in sales over the period between the year of
separation and 1997. However, the use of relative measures produces inflated growth figures
for small firms, and the use of absolute measures produces inflated results for large firms
(Young et al., 1996; Fombrun and Ginsberg, 1990). Therefore, post-spin-off growth was
measured by including the lagged form of the sales and the age of the spin-off venture as
control variables to the regression equations.
We chose sales growth as an outcome of learning instead of some narrower measures, such
as patents and new product introduction. We believe that sales growth represents the outcome
of all three types of knowledge overlap (technological, production, and marketing-related
knowledge) to a greater extent than does patenting or new product introduction. Further, use
of patents, e.g., may reflect strategic decisions rather than learning (Grant, 1996). Important
process knowledge, for example, is seldom patented, because process knowledge can often be
more effectively protected through secrecy. Many technology companies also customarily

<-----Page 9----->818

H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

build and use patent portfolios as strategic assets with which they mark and protect their
competitive domain, making it difficult to determine which patenting activity reflects
‘‘genuine’’ learning by the firm.
4.3. Independent variables
Following the approach originally proposed by Rumelt (1974), knowledge relatedness
between the spin-off firm and the parent firm was operationalized in this study with a set of
statements relating to the similarity of production knowledge, technological knowledge, and
market knowledge during the three last years prior to separation. We obtained the measures of
knowledge relatedness from diversification and spin-off literature (Davis et al., 1992; Woo et
al., 1992; Steensma, 1996; Sorrentino and Williams, 1995). The statements were assessed
using seven-point Likert scales, and a factor analysis confirmed that the statements loaded on
the same factors. For instance, production knowledge relatedness (Cronbach’s a=.67) was
measured with three statements focusing on the extent to which the parent firm and the spinoff were able to share production-related knowledge (e.g., ‘‘The spin-off venture and the
parent firm shared production facilities prior to the establishment of the spin-off firm’’).
Similarly, technological knowledge relatedness was (Cronbach’s a=.84) measured using three
statements relating to the extent to which the technologies of the two were related (e.g., ‘‘The
technology developed within the spin-off firm is based upon the technological strengths of the
parent firm’’). Finally, we measured marketing knowledge relatedness (Cronbach’s a=.81) via
three statements assessing the extent to which market knowledge existed in common (e.g.,
‘‘The parent firm and the spin-off firm shared common market expertise’’).
In the regression analyses, the standardized forms and squared standardized forms of the
construct variables were used to test the predicted relationships. A more detailed description
of the measures can be made available upon a request from the authors. Our data on
knowledge relatedness are based upon the perceptions of the managers of spin-off firms in
1997. To validate our measures, in 1999, we asked 29 representatives of the parent firms to
answer the same set of questions that were used in 1997. The respondents were typically
presidents of the business units from which the spin-off firms had been separated. The
correlation coefficients between the estimations of the managers of spin-off firms and the
parent firms were all above .67. This result gives reason to believe that our measures yield
consistent results regardless of the change in the time of the measurement or in the
information source.
We could have measured relatedness using SIC codes, assuming that two businesses
sharing the same SIC code would have common input requirements and similar production or
technology functions (Markides and Williamson, 1996; Montgomery, 1982; Palepu, 1985;
Grant and Jammine, 1988). We decided not to use SIC-based measures in this study for two
reasons. First, the SIC-based measures have been criticized for focusing on a single point in
the value chain, on production. Second, SIC-based measures overlook the role of tacit
knowledge and capabilities (Robins and Wiersema, 1995; Markides, 1995), and the potential
of the firm to expand its stock of strategic resources and create new ones (Mahoney and
Pandian, 1992; Von Krogh et al., 1996).

<-----Page 10----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

819

In previous studies, production, technological, and marketing relatedness have often been
aggregated into one measure (Mahajan and Wind, 1988; Pitts and Hopkins, 1982; Sorrentino
and Williams, 1995; Woo et al., 1989, 1992; Lindholm, 1997). Only a few studies have made
a distinction between different types of relatedness (Roberts and Berry, 1985; Sykes, 1986;
Davis et al., 1992). We believe that these are distinct types of knowledge and should thus be
measured separately. Our analyses support this decision.
4.4. Control variables
Several control variables were also incorporated into this study, including collaboration,
R&D intensity, ownership, age, and size. Because collaboration influences learning, varying
levels of intensity in the post-spin-off collaboration between the spin-off firm and parent firm
may cloud the predicted influence of knowledge relatedness on learning. Therefore, we
controlled the intensity of post-spin-off collaboration. The intensity of post-spin-off collaboration at the time of the study was measured by asking the respondents to indicate the
intensity of collaboration with the parent firm in the following areas: production, technology,
and marketing and distribution. The intensity of post-spin-off collaboration was measured on
a three-point Likert scale, with 3 indicating very intense collaboration. Because the three
items loaded on a single factor, and because we preferred to use a multi-item scale instead of
single items, the three items were combined into a single variable (a=.66).
Cohen and Levinthal (1990) showed that the learning capacity of the firm is influenced by
its R&D activity. Therefore, we controlled the R&D intensity of the spin-off firms. R&D
expenditure was measured as the percentage of expenses attributed to research and development during the past 3 years prior to the study. This measure is consistent with previous
literature (Gomez-Meijia, 1992; Zahra, 1996).
Ownership of the spin-off firm by the parent firm is likely to influence the intensity of
involvement of the parent firm in the spin-off firm. Therefore, we controlled the parent
ownership, measured as the percentage of the stock of the spin-off firm controlled by the
parent firm at the time of the study.
Age of the spin-off venture was measured as the number of years the spin-off firm has been
an independent organizational entity.

5. Results
Table 1 presents the zero-order correlations among the variables in our study. As should be
expected, some significant correlations existed among our measures of production, technology, and marketing knowledge relatedness between spin-off firms and their parents. Further,
technological knowledge relatedness and marketing knowledge relatedness were significantly
correlated with collaboration. Together, these relationships point to the centrality of
technological knowledge relatedness to the level of interaction between parents and spinoffs. The correlation matrix also indicated that the greater the ownership stake retained by the
parent, the greater the collaboration (r=.28, p < .05). As might be expected, the longer spin-

offs had been independent, the less the ownership share of the parent (r =  .27, P < .05) and
the less likely was collaboration (r =  .27, P < .05). All of these relationships appeared as
would be expected and help support the general validity of the data.
Table 2 presents the results of our hypotheses tests. Focusing on the effects of knowledge
relatedness on sales growth, we controlled for the level of collaboration, the extent of R&D
expenditures, parents’ ownership, and years of independence. To deal with potential spurious
relationships associated with change scores and with ratio variables (Fombrun and Ginsberg,
1990), we controlled for the sales of the spin-off firms at the time of separation.
We employed two-stage hierarchical regressions to test for the hypothesized curvilinear
effects of knowledge relatedness on sales growth. An examination of the standardized betas
of the knowledge relatedness variables in columns 2, 5, and 8 would reveal the linear effects
(if any) of production, technological, and marketing knowledge relatedness on sales growth
of the spin-off firms. Although we did not hypothesize any such effects, it was important to
determine whether simple linear effects were present (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). Table 2
shows that there were no significant linear effects of knowledge relatedness on sales growth.
In the second step (shown in columns 3, 6, and 9) the squared form of the standardized
measures of production, technological, and marketing knowledge relatedness was entered.
For interpretation purposes, a positive quadratic term would indicate a U-shaped upward
curve, while a negative coefficient would indicate a \-shaped downward relationship (Hair et
al., 1995). A significant negative sign for these variables would thus support our hypotheses.

Column 3 shows that production knowledge relatedness squared was significantly negatively
related to sales growth (b =  .63, P < .05), supporting Hypothesis 1. Further, column 6
indicates that technological knowledge relatedness squared was significantly negatively
related to sales growth (b =  .68, P < .05), supporting Hypothesis 2. Finally, it may be seen
from column 9 that while marketing knowledge relatedness squared is also negatively related
to sales growth, the relationship was not significant (b =  .08); thus, Hypothesis 3 was not
supported. Finally, we ran an analysis in which all linear forms of knowledge remain in the
equation, while the quadratic forms were added one at a time (see columns 4, 7, and 10);
results are nearly identical to those just reported.
To illustrate and interpret the pattern of our significant results, we performed median
splits and new regressions. The median split is a convention to examine the pattern of the
curvilinear relationship; it is not a test, it is merely meant to illustrate how the statistical
pattern represented in the equation is observed in the actual data. The farther the inflection
point is from the middle of the scale, the greater the likelihood that the linear term will be

significant (the farther to the left, the more likely a negative linear term is to exist and be
significant; the farther to the right, the more likely the linear term will be positive). It may
be noted that the inflection point need not be in the middle of the scale in our observed
values.
First, we examined the growth pattern as spin-offs moved from very little knowledge
relatedness to the median level; then, we examined the growth pattern as spin-offs moved from
the median level to extremely high knowledge relatedness (e.g., high overlap in production
knowledge). We had predicted that movement from extreme diversity to greater relatedness or
knowledge in common would lead to greater learning and, hence, growth. Fig. 1 shows, as we
had predicted, that (1) as spin-offs and parents move from extreme diversity in production
knowledge toward greater commonality, greater growth resulted (b=.18), and (2) as they moved
from partial knowledge overlap to total overlap, sales growth actually declined (b =  .15).
Fig. 2 reveals the same pattern for technological knowledge relatedness: (1) sales grew as
technology relatedness increased from little overlap to median amounts (b=.07) and (2) they
decreased as knowledge overlap moved from the middle to more extreme levels (b =  .28).
These patterns support the learning and knowledge theories outlined earlier.

Outside of sales at separation, none of the control variables exerted a consistent significant
effect on sales growth: collaboration was mildly positively and R&D expenditure mildly
negatively related to sales growth in the presence of production relatedness; and the extent of
parent ownership was mildly negatively related to sales growth of the spin-off in the presence
of production and technology relatedness.

6. Discussion
We set out in this study to examine one of the fundamental concepts in the emerging
knowledge and learning theories of the firm. Specifically, using a set of Finnish high
technology firms and their spin-offs, we examined the concept that knowledge creation and
assimilation is optimized via the appropriate level of knowledge relatedness. Not only is this
concept a widely held premise central to learning and knowledge theories, but it has been
largely untested. Furthermore, our study set out to test and push the boundaries of organizational learning by examining knowledge creation at the edges of intra- and interorganizational
relations, i.e., the relationship between industrial parent firms and their spin-offs.
We predicted that the greatest learning (an unmeasured construct in our design) would
occur at intermediate levels of knowledge relatedness because too much or too little
knowledge in common would limit learning and, hence, growth. Specifically, we examined
the effects of production, technological, and marketing knowledge relatedness between
parents and spin-off firms on the sales growth of the spin-off firms. As reported in the prior
section, we found that production and technological knowledge relatedness were related to
growth in the curvilinear manner predicted; marketing knowledge relatedness also exhibited
this pattern but the relationship was not significant. Especially given the limited power to
detect relationships of our relatively small sample, these results provide relatively strong
support to hitherto untested assertions of knowledge and learning theories (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990; Zahra and George, 2002). Further, our results suggest that learning effects
extend at least some distance beyond the boundaries of the formal organization: closely
related organizations such as parent and spin-off firms may be able to derive learning benefits
from interaction as do intraorganizational units.
The results failed to show any significant effect of marketing knowledge relatedness on
growth. One possible explanation is that effects of marketing knowledge relatedness are
partially captured in the gains due to collaboration. As may be seen in Table 1, marketing
knowledge relatedness is strongly related to collaboration; thus, any effects on growth may
be masked by collaboration effects. Another explanation for nonsignificant marketing
knowledge relatedness effect is simply that we lacked the power to detect a relationship
that actually exists.
Our study adds to the received diversification literature by applying knowledge-based and
learning theories to predict post-spin-off growth. The knowledge relatedness measures we
used parallel traditional measures of relatedness: traditional measures tap the relatedness of
domains or activities, which imply closely related knowledge (Hill and Hoskisson, 1987).
Our explicit focus on knowledge relatedness has permitted us to draw on knowledge-based

<-----Page 15----->824

H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

and learning theories to predict a curvilinear relationship between relatedness and post-spinoff growth performance. Much of the received diversification research has used coarsegrained measures such as standard industry codes and emphasized the importance of market
competition, production synergies, and technological synergies for post-spin-off performance
(Hill, 1994). Emphasizing such mechanisms, the received research has predicted and tested
for linear relationships between relatedness and performance, with mixed results. The
empirical support for our knowledge and learning-based hypotheses predicting curvilinear
relationships suggests that learning and knowledge accumulation processes may exercise a
more important influence on post-spin-off performance than hitherto recognized. The
consistent empirical support for our knowledge and learning-based hypotheses therefore
suggests that future research on diversification should try to integrate knowledge and
learning-based notions into theory development.
Our results highlight the value of knowledge overlap in spin-off firm–parent relationships. If considered along the spectrum of all strategic alliances, the firms in our sample are
far to the knowledge overlap end of the spectrum. If, for example, a study were conducted
on strategic alliances of less similar firms, knowledge relatedness may appear to have a
strictly increasing, linear effect on growth. The entire spectrum of diversity–commonality
continuum potentially available to strategic alliances could be extended far toward the
diversity end (i.e., imagine extending the spectrum in our Figs. 1 and 2 to the left). Our
results do suggest that there can be too much of a good thing—i.e., beyond a point of
knowledge overlap, little additional knowledge is generated through interaction and may
actually hamper progress. Nonetheless, the results do suggest that ventures with diverse
knowledge bases may expect to learn from one another through collaboration so long as
there is some knowledge overlap, and such learning may result in such tangible outcomes as
sales growth. How much overlap is necessary for learning remains an unexplored issue,
although we would venture to expect a rather positive, linear relationship between knowledge overlaps and learning at low levels of relatedness, levels that are perhaps the norm for
most alliances. As pointed out above, our empirical sample is biased toward the high end of
the relatedness continuum; at low levels, we would expect to see only positive effects of
relatedness. If this speculation holds, then firms might want to seek rather similar partners
for optimal learning. Our results are consistent with Zahra and George (2002) who argued
that exposure to complementary and diverse external knowledge increases the opportunity to
develop dynamic learning capabilities for the creation and maintenance of performance.
Pinpointing the location of the optimal balance between related and unrelated knowledge is
a significant practical and theoretical challenge.
One alternative to our learning theory explanation of the curvilinear relationship is that at
very high levels of knowledge overlap, we may be observing the effects of the parent and
the spin-off competing for the same market. We cannot rule out this possibility. However,
we contend that learning effects are a better explanation given that parents and spin-offs
competing for the same sales would be likely to dissolve their partnerships and would not be
in our sample. Other theories also suggest a relationship between relatedness and sales
growth. For example, transaction cost theory suggests that exploiting synergies may result in
internal transaction costs (Davis and Thomas, 1993; Nayaar, 1992; Hill and Hoskisson,

<-----Page 16----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

825

1987), and agency theory posits that the conflicting interests of internal parties may create
an agency conflict, possibly leading to a deterioration of performance (Hill, 1994). However,
these theories suggest a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship and, as mentioned earlier,
have resulted in inconsistent findings.
6.1. Limitations and implications for further research
Our results may be generalized only with some caution. First, the study was carried out in a
small Scandinavian country. Our focus on a small, culturally homogeneous country has
facilitated our access to research subjects and helped control culturally induced variation in
the measurement of fairly abstract constructs. However, we are not able to check if similar
influences would be found in other cultural settings. Scandinavian countries are sometimes
claimed to have more ‘‘relationship-oriented’’ business cultures than do Anglo-Saxon countries, which are often seen as ‘‘transaction-oriented’’ cultures (Hofstede, 1980). Nonetheless,
our basic theoretic argumentation regarding knowledge relatedness and growth through
learning appears applicable even in transaction-oriented settings. Indeed, using measures of
technology transfer developed by Roberts (1991), Autio (1994) reported technology transfer
patterns in Finnish academic spin-off firms that were very similar to those reported by Roberts
in his several studies of technology transfer from MIT to its spin-off firms in the Cambridge,
MA, region. Thus, we have little reason to believe that the influence of knowledge relatedness
on learning and growth should be different in other settings. Nevertheless, studies in other
countries with a larger number of spin-off firms and parent firms should be carried out.
Second, we chose to use perceptual measures of knowledge relatedness instead of more
objective proxies (such as similarity of patents and customers, use of similar suppliers,
components, and production machinery), because such proxies tend to be imprecise (Grant,
1996). However, by so doing we have sacrificed external validity for relevance. It is a
paradox of the knowledge-based view of the firm that the concepts of greatest theoretical
interest tend to be those that are the most difficult to measure (Spender and Grant, 1996, p. 8).
Our efforts here represent one more step in developing validated subjective measures; further
such steps are needed.
Third, consistent with recent work (Autio et al., 2000; Zahra et al., 2002), we used growth as
a tangible manifestation of learning in young firms. Learning itself is another very difficult
construct to measure. Also, there is considerable disagreement in the organization theory
literature as to what organizational learning actually is, and how, for example, the relationship
between individual and organizational learning operates (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). We
have taken the pragmatic view that in environments in which learning-by-doing processes
dominate, the results of learning should be transformed into changes in behavior, which has a
direct effect on organizational performance. As a measure of performance, we have used sales
growth, the most commonly used performance measure in the entrepreneurship literature
(Brush and Vanderwerk, 1992). As the learning theories suggest, other performance measures
such as profitability or operational efficiency, could be used (Zahra et al., 2002). Studies using
alternative measures of performance would provide a good test of the generality of the
influences studied here.

<-----Page 17----->826

H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

Fourth, as a minor point, we have controlled for the intensity of collaboration in the
regression analyses, because collaboration is likely to impact learning. To achieve a better
internal reliability for the measure, we chose to use a single composite measure that
reflected production, technological, and marketing collaboration. For stronger results, it
would have been optimal to use separate multi-item measures for each of the three types of
collaboration.
Several productive avenues for future research exist. The discrepancies in past research
may have partly arisen from failure to distinguish between different types of knowledge
resources. Studies that focus in sufficient detail on the antecedents and consequences of
variation in the nature of knowledge would be useful. For instance, some knowledge
resources can be more easily transferred across the boundaries of business units than others,
and the codifiability of a knowledge item may influence the ease with which it can be shared.
Future theory development should focus on which types of knowledge resources are best
suited for sharing in dyadic relationships between firms. In addition, the knowledge-based
approach, learning theory, and cognitive psychology suffer from vague construct operationalization, in that the existing measures of resource relatedness tend to ignore many important
aspects of resource sharing relationships. Most importantly, they rarely distinguish between
bilateral and unilateral resource sharing (Capron and Mitchell, 1998), a dimension that
directly affects the balance of learning between firms. More detailed definitions are clearly
called for in future research.
Whereas we focused on learning effects manifested in the growth of the spin-off firm,
earlier work suggests that the knowledge-based approaches ignore power asymmetries in a
learning relationship (Larsson et al., 1998). In general, the party who is able to exert power in
a resource sharing relationship may dictate who is going to benefit from the exchange of
knowledge resources. Therefore, the impact of a learning relationship on the spin-off unit
may differ from the impact of the same relationship on the parent firm. This idea should be
explored. Exploring how much the parent firm learns (and, in our current framing, how much
it grows) as a result of relatedness would be an extension of Lane and Lubatkin’s (1998)
concepts of ‘‘teacher’’ and ‘‘learner’’ firms in cooperative arrangements; it would raise the
issues both of bilateral learning and of the role of power in likelihood to gain from the
presence of new external knowledge.
Earlier research also suggests that the age of the venture may have an impact on its
learning ability (Amburgey et al., 1993) and that young ventures may be able to learn faster
than older ventures, an effect referred to as the ‘‘learning advantage of newness’’ (Autio et al.,
2000). Consequently, when in its existence the venture is spun off from the parent firm may
moderate the learning effects reported here. Further, how learning occurs and how it is
translated into potential and realized absorptive capacity over time needs closer study (Zahra
et al., 2002; Zahra and George, 2002). More fine-grained, qualitative approaches may be
needed to discover what factors may foster or inhibit the learning processes between firms.
An additional emphasis on mutual value creation through learning in an interorganizational
relationship would help provide a richer understanding of both the positive and negative
aspects of interorganizational learning. Finally, the boundaries of the theory we laid out here
still require investigation: How unrelated may strategic partners be and still benefit from

<-----Page 18----->H.J. Sapienza et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 809–829

827

interaction? What will be the effect of moving from a dyadic relationship to a portfolio of
learning alliances?
In conclusion, our study has contributed to research by providing evidence that the
relationship between ex ante knowledge relatedness and growth of the spin-off firm is
curvilinear and by distinguishing between different types of knowledge relatedness in a
dyadic learning relationship. Our results demonstrated the salience of knowledge and learning
approaches to understanding entrepreneurial firm growth and the influence of interorganizational relationships on this process. Second, our study contributes to the existing literature by
identifying some of the difficulties of the knowledge-based approach, learning theory, and
cognitive psychology to explain the relationship between resource sharing and performance.
We hope that this study will inspire further research on these important but largely
understudied processes.
