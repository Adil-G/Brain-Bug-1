Abstract
Recent empirical research in finance has uncovered two families of pervasive regularities: underreaction of stock prices to news such as earnings announcements, and overreaction of stock prices to a series of good or bad news. In this paper, we present a parsimonious model of investor sentiment, or of how investors form beliefs, which is consistent with
the empirical findings. The model is based on psychological evidence and produces both
underreaction and overreaction for a wide range of parameter values. ( 1998 Elsevier

1. Introduction
Recent empirical research in finance has identified two families of pervasive
regularities: underreaction and overreaction. The underreaction evidence shows
that over horizons of perhaps 1—12 months, security prices underreact to news.2

As a consequence, news is incorporated only slowly into prices, which tend to
exhibit positive autocorrelations over these horizons. A related way to make this
point is to say that current good news has power in predicting positive returns in
the future. The overreaction evidence shows that over longer horizons of
perhaps 3—5 years, security prices overreact to consistent patterns of news
pointing in the same direction. That is, securities that have had a long record of
good news tend to become overpriced and have low average returns afterwards.3 Put differently, securities with strings of good performance, however
measured, receive extremely high valuations, and these valuations, on average,
return to the mean.4
The evidence presents a challenge to the efficient markets theory because it
suggests that in a variety of markets, sophisticated investors can earn superior
returns by taking advantage of underreaction and overreaction without bearing
extra risk. The most notable recent attempt to explain the evidence from the
efficient markets viewpoint is Fama and French (1996). The authors believe that
their three-factor model can account for the overreaction evidence, but not for
the continuation of short-term returns (underreaction). This evidence also presents a challenge to behavioral finance theory because early models do not
successfully explain the facts.5 The challenge is to explain how investors might
form beliefs that lead to both underreaction and overreaction.
In this paper, we propose a parsimonious model of investor sentiment — of
how investors form beliefs — that is consistent with the available statistical
evidence. The model is also consistent with experimental evidence on both the
failures of individual judgment under uncertainty and the trading patterns of
investors in experimental situations. In particular, our specification is consistent
with the results of Tversky and Kahneman (1974) on the important behavioral
heuristic known as representativeness, or the tendency of experimental subjects
to view events as typical or representative of some specific class and to ignore the
laws of probability in the process. In the stock market, for example, investors
might classify some stocks as growth stocks based on a history of consistent

3 Some of the papers in this area, discussed in more detail in Section 2, include Cutler et al. (1991),
De Bondt and Thaler (1985), Chopra et al. (1992), Fama and French (1992), Lakonishok et al. (1994),
and La Porta (1996).
4 There is also some evidence of nonzero return autocorrelations at very short horizons such as
a day (Lehmann, 1990). We do not believe that it is essential for a behavioral model to confront this
evidence because it can be plausibly explained by market microstructure considerations such as the
fluctuation of recorded prices between the bid and the ask.
5 The model of De Long et al. (1990a) generates negative autocorrelation in returns, and that of De
Long et al. (1990b) generates positive autocorrelation. Cutler et al. (1991) combine elements of the
two De Long et al. models in an attempt to explain some of the autocorrelation evidence. These
models focus exclusively on prices and hence do not confront the crucial earnings evidence discussed
in Section 2.

earnings growth, ignoring the likelihood that there are very few companies that
just keep growing. Our model also relates to another phenomenon documented
in psychology, namely conservatism, defined as the slow updating of models in
the face of new evidence (Edwards, 1968). The underreaction evidence in particular is consistent with conservatism.
Our model is that of one investor and one asset. This investor should be
viewed as one whose beliefs reflect ‘consensus forecasts’ even when different
investors hold different expectations. The beliefs of this representative investor
affect prices and returns.
We do not explain in the model why arbitrage fails to eliminate the mispricing. For the purposes of this paper, we rely on earlier work showing why
deviations from efficient prices can persist (De Long et al., 1990a; Shleifer and
Vishny, 1997). According to this work, an important reason why arbitrage is
limited is that movements in investor sentiment are in part unpredictable, and
therefore arbitrageurs betting against mispricing run the risk, at least in the
short run, that investor sentiment becomes more extreme and prices move even
further away from fundamental value. As a consequence of such ‘noise trader
risk,’ arbitrage positions can lose money in the short run. When arbitrageurs are
risk-averse, leveraged, or manage other people’s money and run the risk of
losing funds under management when performance is poor, the risk of deepening mispricing reduces the size of the positions they take. Hence, arbitrage fails
to eliminate the mispricing completely and investor sentiment affects security
prices in equilibrium. In the model below, investor sentiment is indeed in part
unpredictable, and therefore, if arbitrageurs were introduced into the model,
arbitrage would be limited.6
While these earlier papers argue that mispricing can persist, they say little
about the nature of the mispricing that might be observed. For that, we need
a model of how people form expectations. The current paper provides one such
model.
In our model, the earnings of the asset follow a random walk. However, the
investor does not know that. Rather, he believes that the behavior of a given
firm’s earnings moves between two ‘states’ or ‘regimes’. In the first state, earnings
are mean-reverting. In the second state, they trend, i.e., are likely to rise further
after an increase. The transition probabilities between the two regimes, as well as
the statistical properties of the earnings process in each one of them, are fixed in

6 The empirical implications of our model are derived from the assumptions about investor
psychology or sentiment, rather than from those about the behavior of arbitrageurs. Other models in
behavioral finance yield empirical implications that follow from limited arbitrage alone, without
specific assumptions about the form of investor sentiment. For example, limited arbitrage in
closed-end funds predicts average underpricing of such funds regardless of the exact form of investor
sentiment that these funds are subject to (see De Long et al., 1990a; Lee et al., 1991).

the investor’s mind. In particular, in any given period, the firm’s earnings are
more likely to stay in a given regime than to switch. Each period, the investor
observes earnings, and uses this information to update his beliefs about which
state he is in. In his updating, the investor is Bayesian, although his model of the
earnings process is inaccurate. Specifically, when a positive earnings surprise is
followed by another positive surprise, the investor raises the likelihood that he is
in the trending regime, whereas when a positive surprise is followed by a negative surprise, the investor raises the likelihood that he is in the mean-reverting
regime. We solve this model and show that, for a plausible range of parameter
values, it generates the empirical predictions observed in the data.
Daniel et al. (1998) also construct a model of investor sentiment aimed at
reconciling the empirical findings of overreaction and underreaction. They, too,
use concepts from psychology to support their framework, although the underpinnings of their model are overconfidence and self-attribution, which are not
the same as the psychological ideas we use. It is quite possible that both the
phenomena that they describe, and those driving our model, play a role in
generating the empirical evidence.
Section 2 of the paper summarizes the empirical findings that we try to
explain. Section 3 discusses the psychological evidence that motivates our
approach. Section 4 presents the model. Section 5 solves it and outlines its
implications for the data. Section 6 concludes.

2. The evidence
In this section, we summarize the statistical evidence of underreaction and
overreaction in security returns. We devote only minor attention to the behavior
of aggregate stock and bond returns because these data generally do not provide
enough information to reject the hypothesis of efficient markets. Most of the
anomalous evidence that our model tries to explain comes from the crosssection of stock returns. Much of this evidence is from the United States,
although some recent research has found similar patterns in other markets.

2.1. Statistical evidence of underreaction
Before presenting the empirical findings, we first explain what we mean by
underreaction to news announcements. Suppose that in each time period, the
investor hears news about a particular company. We denote the news he hears in
period t as z . This news can be either good or bad, i.e., z "G or z "B. By
t
t
t
underreaction we mean that the average return on the company’s stock in the
period following an announcement of good news is higher than the average

return in the period following bad news:
E(r Dz "G)'E(r Dz "B).
t`1 t
t`1 t
In other words, the stock underreacts to the good news, a mistake which is
corrected in the following period, giving a higher return at that time. In this
paper, the good news consists of an earnings announcement that is higher than
expected, although as we discuss below, there is considerable evidence of
underreaction to other types of news as well.
Empirical analysis of aggregate time series has produced some evidence of
underreaction. Cutler et al. (1991) examine autocorrelations in excess returns on
various indexes over different horizons. They look at returns on stocks, bonds,
and foreign exchange in different markets over the period 1960—1988 and
generally, though not uniformly, find positive autocorrelations in excess index
returns over horizons of between one month and one year. For example, the
average one-month autocorrelation in excess stock returns across the world is
around 0.1 (and is also around 0.1 in the United States alone), and that in excess
bond returns is around 0.2 (and around zero in the United States). Many of these
autocorrelations are statistically significant. This autocorrelation evidence is
consistent with the underreaction hypothesis, which states that stock prices
incorporate information slowly, leading to trends in returns over short horizons.
More convincing support for the underreaction hypothesis comes from the
studies of the cross-section of stock returns in the United States, which look at
the actual news events as well as the predictability of returns. Bernard (1992)
surveys one class of such studies, which deals with the underreaction of stock
prices to announcements of company earnings.
The finding of these studies is roughly as follows. Suppose we sort stocks into
groups (say deciles) based on how much of a surprise is contained in their
earnings announcement. One naive way to measure an earnings surprise is to
look at standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), defined as the difference
between a company’s earnings in a given quarter and its earnings during the
quarter a year before, scaled by the standard deviation of the company’s
earnings. Another way to measure an earnings surprise is by the stock price
reaction to an earnings announcement. A general (and unsurprising) finding is
that stocks with positive earnings surprises also earn relatively high returns in
the period prior to the earnings announcement, as information about earnings is
incorporated into prices. A much more surprising finding is that stocks with
higher earnings surprises also earn higher returns in the period after portfolio
formation: the market underreacts to the earnings announcement in revising
a company’s stock price. For example, over the 60 trading days after portfolio
formation, stocks with the highest SUE earn a cumulative risk-adjusted return
that is 4.2% higher than the return on stocks with the lowest SUE (see Bernard,
1992). Thus, stale information, namely the SUE or the past earnings announcement return, has predictive power for future risk-adjusted returns. Or, put

<-----Page 5----->312

N. Barberis et al./Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

differently, information about earnings is only slowly incorporated into stock
prices.
Bernard also summarizes some evidence on the actual properties of the time
series of earnings, and provides an interpretation for his findings. The relevant
series is changes in a company’s earnings in a given quarter relative to the same
calendar quarter in the previous year. Over the period 1974—1986, using
a sample of 2626 firms, Bernard and Thomas (1990) find that these series exhibit
an autocorrelation of about 0.34 at a lag of one quarter, 0.19 at two quarters,
0.06 at three quarters, and !0.24 at four quarters. That is, earnings changes
exhibit a slight trend at one-, two-, and three-quarter horizons and a slight
reversal after a year. In interpreting the evidence, Bernard conjectures that
market participants do not recognize the positive autocorrelations in earnings
changes, and in fact believe that earnings follow a random walk. This belief
causes them to underreact to earnings announcements. Our model in Section 3
uses a related idea for generating underreaction: we suppose that earnings follow
a random walk but that investors typically assume that earnings are meanreverting. The key idea that generates underreaction, which Bernard’s and our
analyses share, is that investors typically (but not always) believe that earnings
are more stationary than they really are. As we show below, this idea has firm
foundations in psychology.
Further evidence of underreaction comes from Jegadeesh and Titman (1993),
who examine a cross-section of U.S. stock returns and find reliable evidence that
over a six-month horizon, stock returns are positively autocorrelated. Similarly
to the earnings drift evidence, they interpret their finding of the ‘momentum’ in
stock returns as pointing to underreaction to information and slow incorporation of information into prices.7 More recent work by Rouwenhorst (1997)
documents the presence of momentum in international equity markets. Chan
et al. (1997) integrate the earnings drift evidence with the momentum evidence.
They use three measures of earnings surprise: SUE, stock price reaction to the
earnings announcement, and changes in analysts’ forecasts of earnings. The
authors find that all these measures, as well as the past return, help predict
subsequent stock returns at horizons of six months and one year. That is, stocks
with a positive earnings surprise, as well as stocks with high past returns, tend to
subsequently outperform stocks with a negative earnings surprise and poor
returns. Like the other authors, Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok conclude that
investors underreact to news and incorporate information into prices slowly.
In addition to the evidence of stock price underreaction to earnings
announcements and the related evidence of momentum in stock prices, there is
also a body of closely related evidence on stock price drift following many other
announcements and events. For example, Ikenberry et al. (1995) find that stock

7 Early evidence on momentum is also contained in De Bondt and Thaler (1985).

<-----Page 6----->N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

313

prices rise on the announcement of share repurchases but then continue to drift
in the same direction over the next few years. Michaely et al. (1995) find similar
evidence of drift following dividend initiations and omissions, while Ikenberry
et al. (1996) document such a drift following stock splits. Finally, Loughran and
Ritter (1995) and Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995) find evidence of a drift
following seasoned equity offerings. Daniel et al. (1998) and Fama (1998)
summarize a large number of event studies showing this type of underreaction to
news events, which a theory of investor sentiment should presumably come to
grips with.
2.2. Statistical evidence of overreaction
Analogous to the definition of underreaction at the start of the previous
subsection, we now define overreaction as occurring when the average return
following not one but a series of announcements of good news is lower than the
average return following a series of bad news announcements. Using the same
notation as before,
E(r Dz "G, z "G,2, z "G)
t`1 t
t~1
t~j
(E(r Dz "B, z "B,2, z "B),
t`1 t
t~1
t~j
where j is at least one and probably rather higher. The idea here is simply that
after a series of announcements of good news, the investor becomes overly
optimistic that future news announcements will also be good and hence overreacts, sending the stock price to unduly high levels. Subsequent news announcements are likely to contradict his optimism, leading to lower returns.
Empirical studies of predictability of aggregate index returns over long
horizons are extremely numerous. Early papers include Fama and French (1988)
and Poterba and Summers (1988); Cutler et al. (1991) examine some of this
evidence for a variety of markets. The thrust of the evidence is that, over
horizons of 3—5 years, there is a relatively slight negative autocorrelation in
stock returns in many markets. Moreover, over similar horizons, some measures
of stock valuation, such as the dividend yield, have predictive power for returns
in a similar direction: a low dividend yield or high past return tend to predict
a low subsequent return (Campbell and Shiller, 1988).
As before, the more convincing evidence comes from the cross-section of stock
returns. In an early important paper, De Bondt and Thaler (1985) discover from
looking at U.S. data dating back to 1933 that portfolios of stocks with extremely
poor returns over the previous five years dramatically outperform portfolios of
stocks with extremely high returns, even after making the standard risk adjustments. De Bondt and Thaler’s findings are corroborated by later work
(e.g., Chopra et al., 1992). In the case of earnings, Zarowin (1989) finds that
firms that have had a sequence of bad earnings realizations subsequently

<-----Page 7----->314

N. Barberis et al./Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

outperform firms with a sequence of good earnings. This evidence suggests that
stocks with a consistent record of good news, and hence extremely high past
returns, are overvalued, and that an investor can therefore earn abnormal
returns by betting against this overreaction to consistent patterns of news.
Similarly, stocks with a consistent record of bad news become undervalued and
subsequently earn superior returns.
Subsequent work has changed the focus from past returns to other measures
of valuation, such as the ratio of market value to book value of assets (De Bondt
and Thaler, 1987; Fama and French, 1992), market value to cash flow
(Lakonishok et al., 1994), and other accounting measures. All this evidence
points in the same direction. Stocks with very high valuations relative to their
assets or earnings (glamour stocks), which tend to be stocks of companies with
extremely high earnings growth over the previous several years, earn relatively
low risk-adjusted returns in the future, whereas stocks with low valuations
(value stocks) earn relatively high returns. For example, Lakonishok et al. find
spreads of 8—10% per year between returns of the extreme value and glamour
deciles. Again, this evidence points to overreaction to a prolonged record of
extreme performance, whether good or bad: the prices of stocks with such
extreme performance tend to be too extreme relative to what these stocks are
worth and relative to what the subsequent returns actually deliver. Recent
research extends the evidence on value stocks to other markets, including those
in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets (Fama and French, 1998; Haugen and
Baker, 1996).
The economic interpretation of this evidence has proved more controversial,
since some authors, particularly Fama and French (1992, 1996), argue that
glamour stocks are in fact less risky, and value stocks more risky, once risk is
properly measured. In a direct attempt to distinguish risk and overreaction,
La Porta (1996) sorts stocks on the basis of long-term growth rate forecasts
made by professional analysts, and finds evidence that analysts are excessively
bullish about the stocks they are most optimistic about and excessively bearish
about the stocks they are most pessimistic about. In particular, stocks with the
highest growth forecasts earn much lower future returns than stocks with the
lowest growth forecasts. Moreover, on average, stocks with high growth forecasts earn negative returns when they subsequently announce earnings and
stocks with low growth forecasts earn high returns. All this evidence points to
overreaction not just by analysts but more importantly in prices as well: in an
efficient market, stocks with optimistic growth forecasts should not earn low
returns.
Finally, La Porta et al. (1997) find direct evidence of overreaction in glamour
and value stocks defined using accounting variables. Specifically, glamour
stocks earn negative returns on the days of their future earnings announcements,
and value stocks earn positive returns. The market learns when earnings are
announced that its valuations have been too extreme.

315

In sum, the cross-sectional overreaction evidence, like the cross-sectional
underreaction evidence, presents rather reliable regularities. These regularities
taken in their entirety are difficult to reconcile with the efficient markets
hypothesis. More important for this paper, the two regularities challenge behavioral finance to provide a model of how investors form beliefs that can account
for the empirical evidence.

3. Some psychological evidence
The model we present below is motivated by two important phenomena
documented by psychologists: conservatism and the representativeness heuristic.
In this subsection, we briefly describe this psychological evidence as well as
a recent attempt to integrate it (Griffin and Tversky, 1992).
Several psychologists, including Edwards (1968), have identified a phenomenon known as conservatism. Conservatism states that individuals are slow to
change their beliefs in the face of new evidence. Edwards benchmarks a subject’s
reaction to new evidence against that of an idealized rational Bayesian in
experiments in which the true normative value of a piece of evidence is well
defined. In his experiments, individuals update their posteriors in the right
direction, but by too little in magnitude relative to the rational Bayesian
benchmark. This finding of conservatism is actually more pronounced the more
objectively useful is the new evidence. In Edwards’ own words:
It turns out that opinion change is very orderly, and usually proportional to
numbers calculated from the Bayes Theorem — but it is insufficient in amount.
A conventional first approximation to the data would say that it takes anywhere
from two to five observations to do one observation’s worth of work in inducing
a subject to change his opinions. (p. 359)
Conservatism is extremely suggestive of the underreaction evidence described
above. Individuals subject to conservatism might disregard the full information
content of an earnings (or some other public) announcement, perhaps because
they believe that this number contains a large temporary component, and still
cling at least partially to their prior estimates of earnings. As a consequence,
they might adjust their valuation of shares only partially in response to the
announcement. Edwards would describe such behavior in Bayesian terms as
a failure to properly aggregate the information in the new earnings number with
investors’ own prior information to form a new posterior earnings estimate. In
particular, individuals tend to underweight useful statistical evidence relative to
the less useful evidence used to form their priors. Alternatively, they might be
characterized as being overconfident about their prior information.
A second important phenomenon documented by psychologists is the representativeness heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974): “A person who follows
this heuristic evaluates the probability of an uncertain event, or a sample, by the

<-----Page 9----->316

N. Barberis et al./Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

degree to which it is (i) similar in its essential properties to the parent population, (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated”
(p. 33). For example, if a detailed description of an individual’s personality
matches up well with the subject’s experiences with people of a particular
profession, the subject tends to significantly overestimate the actual probability
that the given individual belongs to that profession. In overweighting the
representative description, the subject underweights the statistical base rate
evidence of the small fraction of the population belonging to that profession.
An important manifestation of the representativeness heuristic, discussed in
detail by Tversky and Kahneman, is that people think they see patterns in truly
random sequences. This aspect of the representativeness heuristic is suggestive
of the overreaction evidence described above. When a company has a consistent
history of earnings growth over several years, accompanied as it may be by
salient and enthusiastic descriptions of its products and management, investors
might conclude that the past history is representative of an underlying earnings
growth potential. While a consistent pattern of high growth may be nothing
more than a random draw for a few lucky firms, investors see ‘order among
chaos’ and infer from the in-sample growth path that the firm belongs to a small
and distinct population of firms whose earnings just keep growing. As a consequence, investors using the representativeness heuristic might disregard the
reality that a history of high earnings growth is unlikely to repeat itself; they will
overvalue the company, and be disappointed in the future when the forecasted
earnings growth fails to materialize. This, of course, is what overreaction is all
about.
In a recent study, Griffin and Tversky (1992) attempt to reconcile conservatism with representativeness. In their framework, people update their beliefs
based on the ‘strength’ and the ‘weight’ of new evidence. Strength refers to such
aspects of the evidence as salience and extremity, whereas weight refers to
statistical informativeness, such as sample size.8 According to Griffin and
Tversky, in revising their forecasts, people focus too much on the strength of the
evidence, and too little on its weight, relative to a rational Bayesian. In the
Griffin—Tversky framework, conservatism like that documented by Edwards
would occur in the face of evidence that has high weight but low strength: people
are unimpressed by the low strength and react mildly to the evidence, even
though its weight calls for a larger reaction. On the other hand, when the
evidence has high strength but low weight, overreaction occurs in a manner
consistent with representativeness. Indeed, representativeness can be thought of
as excessive attention to the strength of particularly salient evidence, in spite of
its relatively low weight.
8 To illustrate these concepts, Griffin and Tversky use the example of a recommendation letter.
The ‘strength’ of the letter refers to how positive and warm its content is; ‘weight’ on the other hand,
measures the credibility and stature of the letter-writer.

<-----Page 10----->N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

317

In the context at hand, Griffin and Tversky’s theory suggests that individuals
might underweight the information contained in isolated quarterly earnings
announcements, since a single earnings number seems like a weakly informative
blip exhibiting no particular pattern or strength on its own. In doing so, they
ignore the substantial weight that the latest earnings news has for forecasting the
level of earnings, particularly when earnings are close to a random walk. At the
same time, individuals might overweight consistent multiyear patterns of noticeably high or low earnings growth. Such data can be very salient, or have high
strength, yet their weight in forecasting earnings growth rates can be quite low.
Unfortunately, the psychological evidence does not tell us quantitatively what
kind of information is strong and salient (and hence is overreacted to) and what
kind of information is low in weight (and hence is underreacted to). For example,
it does not tell us how long a sequence of earnings increases is required for its
strength to cause significant overpricing. Nor does the evidence tell us the
magnitude of the reaction (relative to a true Bayesian) to information that has
high strength and weight, or low strength and weight. For these reasons, it
would be inappropriate for us to say that our model is derived from the
psychological evidence, as opposed to just being motivated by it.
There are also some stock trading experiments that are consistent with the
psychological evidence as well as with the model presented below. Andreassen
and Kraus (1990) show subjects (who are university undergraduates untrained
in finance) a time series of stock prices and ask them to trade at the prevailing
price. After subjects trade, the next realization of price appears, and they can
trade again. Trades do not affect prices: subjects trade with a time series rather
than with each other. Stock prices are rescaled real stock prices taken from the
financial press, and sometimes modified by the introduction of trends.
Andreassen and Kraus’s basic findings are as follows. Subjects generally
‘track prices’, i.e., sell when prices rise and buy when prices fall, even when the
series they are offered is a random walk. This is the fairly universal mode of
behavior, which is consistent with underreaction to news in markets. However,
when subjects are given a series of data with an ostensible trend, they reduce
tracking, i.e., they trade less in response to price movements. It is not clear from
Andreassen and Kraus’s results whether subjects actually switch from bucking
trends to chasing them, although their findings certainly suggest it.
De Bondt (1993) nicely complements Andreassen and Kraus’s findings. Using
a combination of classroom experiments and investor surveys, De Bondt finds
strong evidence that people extrapolate past trends. In one case, he asks subjects
to forecast future stock price levels after showing them past stock prices over
unnamed periods. He also analyzes a sample of regular forecasts of the Dow
Jones Index from a survey of members of the American Association of Individual Investors. In both cases, the forecasted change in price level is higher
following a series of previous price increases than following price decreases,
suggesting that investors indeed chase trends once they think they see them.

4. A model of investor sentiment
4.1. Informal description of the model
The model we present in this section attempts to capture the empirical
evidence summarized in Section 2 using the ideas from psychology discussed in
Section 3. We consider a model with a representative, risk-neutral investor with
discount rate d. We can think of this investor’s beliefs as reflecting the ‘consensus’, even if different investors have different beliefs. There is only one security,
which pays out 100% of its earnings as dividends; in this context, the equilibrium price of the security is equal to the net present value of future earnings, as
forecasted by the representative investor. In contrast to models with heterogeneous agents, there is no information in prices over and above the information
already contained in earnings.
Given the assumptions of risk-neutrality and a constant discount rate, returns
are unpredictable if the investor knows the correct process followed by the
earnings stream, a fact first established by Samuelson (1965). If our model is to
generate the kind of predictability in returns documented in the empirical
studies discussed in Section 2, the investor must be using the wrong model to
form expectations.
We suppose that the earnings stream follows a random walk. This assumption
is not entirely accurate, as we discussed above, since earnings growth rates at
one- to three-quarter horizons are slightly positively autocorrelated (Bernard
and Thomas, 1990). We make our assumption for concreteness, and it is not at
all essential for generating the results. What is essential is that investors sometimes believe that earnings are more stationary than they really are — the idea
stressed by Bernard and captured within our model below. This relative misperception is the key to underreaction.
The investor in our model does not realize that earnings follow a random
walk. He thinks that the world moves between two ‘states’ or ‘regimes’ and that
there is a different model governing earnings in each regime. When the world is
in regime 1, Model 1 determines earnings; in regime 2, it is Model 2 that
determines them. Neither of the two models is a random walk. Rather, under
Model 1, earnings are mean-reverting; in Model 2, they trend. For simplicity, we
specify these models as Markov processes: that is, in each model the change in
earnings in period t depends only on the change in earnings in period t!1. The
only difference between the two models lies in the transition probabilities. Under
Model 1, earnings shocks are likely to be reversed in the following period, so
that a positive shock to earnings is more likely to be followed in the next period
by a negative shock than by another positive shock. Under Model 2, shocks are
more likely to be followed by another shock of the same sign.
The idea that the investor believes that the world is governed by one of the
two incorrect models is a crude way of capturing the psychological phenomena

of the previous section. Model 1 generates effects identical to those predicted by
conservatism. An investor using Model 1 to forecast earnings reacts too little to
an individual earnings announcement, as would an investor exhibiting conservatism. From the perspective of Griffin and Tversky (1992), there is insufficient
reaction to individual earnings announcements because they are low in strength.
In fact, these announcements have extremely high weight when earnings follow
a random walk, but investors are insensitive to this aspect of the evidence.
In contrast, the investor who believes in Model 2 behaves as if he is subject to
the representativeness heuristic. After a string of positive or negative earnings
changes, the investor uses Model 2 to forecast future earnings, extrapolating
past performance too far into the future. This captures the way that representativeness might lead investors to associate past earnings growth too strongly with
future earnings growth. In the language of Griffin and Tversky, investors
overreact to the information in a string of positive or negative earnings changes
since it is of high strength; they ignore the fact that it has low weight when
earnings simply follow a random walk.
The investor also believes that there is an underlying regime-switching process that determines which regime the world is in at any time. We specify this
underlying process as a Markov process as well, so that whether the current
regime is Model 1 or Model 2 depends only on what the regime was last period.
We focus attention on cases in which regime switches are relatively rare. That is,
if Model 1 determines the change in earnings in period t, it is likely that it
determines earnings in period t#1 also. The same applies to Model 2. With
some small probability, though, the regime changes, and the other model begins
generating earnings. For reasons that will become apparent, we often require the
regime-switching probabilities to be such that the investor thinks that the world
is in the mean-reverting regime of Model 1 more often than he believes it to be in
the trending regime of Model 2.
The transition probabilities associated with Models 1 and 2 and with the
underlying regime-switching process are fixed in the investor’s mind. In order to
value the security, the investor needs to forecast future earnings. To do this, he
uses the earnings stream he has observed to update his beliefs about which
regime is generating earnings. Once this is done, he uses the regime-switching
model to forecast future earnings. The investor updates in a Bayesian fashion
even though his model of earnings is incorrect. For instance, if he observes two
consecutive earnings shocks of the same sign, he believes more strongly that he is
in the trending earnings regime of Model 2. If the earnings shock this period is
of the opposite sign to last period’s earnings shock, he puts more weight on
Model 1, the mean-reverting regime.
Our model differs from more typical models of learning. In our framework,
the investor never changes the model he is using to forecast earnings, but rather
uses the same regime-switching model, with the same regimes and transition
probabilities throughout. Even after observing a very long stream of earnings

<-----Page 13----->320

data, he does not change his model to something more like a random walk, the
true earnings process. His only task is to figure out which of the two regimes of
his model is currently generating earnings. This is the only sense in which he is
learning from the data.9
We now provide some preliminary intuition for how investor behavior of the
kind described above, coupled with the true random walk process for earnings,
can generate the empirical phenomena discussed in Section 2. In particular, we
show how our framework can lead to both underreaction to earnings announcements and long-run overreaction.
In our model, a natural way of capturing overreaction is to say that the
average realized return following a string of positive shocks to earnings is lower
than the average realized return following a string of negative shocks to
earnings. Indeed, after our investor sees a series of positive earnings shocks, he
puts a high probability on the event that Model 2 is generating current earnings.
Since he believes regime switches to be rare, this means that Model 2 is also
likely to generate earnings in the next period. The investor therefore expects the
shock to earnings next period to be positive again. Earnings, however, follow
a random walk: next period’s earnings are equally likely to go up or down. If
they go up, the return will not be large, as the investor is expecting exactly that,
namely a rise in earnings. If they fall, however, the return is large and negative as
the investor is taken by surprise by the negative announcement.10 The average
realized return after a string of positive shocks is therefore negative; symmetrically, the average return after a string of negative earnings shocks is positive. The
difference between the average returns in the two cases is negative, consistent
with the empirically observed overreaction.
Now we turn to underreaction. Following our discussion in Section 2, we can
think of underreaction as the fact that the average realized return following
a positive shock to earnings is greater than the average realized return following
a negative shock to earnings. Underreaction obtains in our model as long as the
investor places more weight on Model 1 than on Model 2, on average. Consider
the realized return following a positive earnings shock. Since, by assumption, the
investor on average believes Model 1, he on average believes that this positive
earnings shock will be partly reversed in the next period. In reality, however,
a positive shock is as likely to be followed by a positive as by a negative shock. If
the shock is negative, the realized return is not large, since this is the earnings
9 From a mathematical perspective, the investor would eventually learn the true random walk
model for earnings if it were included in the support of his prior; from the viewpoint of psychology,
though, there is much evidence that people learn slowly and find it difficult to shake off pervasive
biases such as conservatism and representativeness.
10 A referee has pointed out to us that this is exactly the empirical finding of Dreman and Berry
(1995). They find that glamour stocks earn small positive event returns on positive earnings surprises
and large negative event returns on negative earnings surprises. The converse holds for value stocks.

<-----Page 14----->N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

321

realization that was expected by the investor. If the shock is positive, the realized
return is large and positive, since this shock is unexpected. Similarly, the average
realized return following a negative earnings shock is negative, and hence the
difference in the average realized returns is indeed positive, consistent with the
evidence of post-earnings announcement drift and short-term momentum.
The empirical studies discussed in Section 2 indicate that underreaction may
be a broader phenomenon than simply the delayed reaction to earnings
documented by Bernard and Thomas (1989). Although our model is formulated
in terms of earnings news, delayed reaction to announcements about dividends
and share repurchases can be understood just as easily in our framework. In the
same way that the investor displays conservatism when adjusting his beliefs in
the face of a new earnings announcement, so he may also underweight the
information in the announcement of a dividend cut or a share repurchase.
The mechanism for expectation formation that we propose here is related to
that used by Barsky and De Long (1993) in an attempt to explain Shiller’s (1981)
finding of excess volatility in the price-dividend ratio. They suppose that
investors view the growth rate of dividends as a parameter that is not only
unknown but also changing over time. The optimal estimate of the parameter
closely resembles a distributed lag on past one-period dividend growth rates,
with declining weights. If dividends rise steadily over several periods, the
investor’s estimate of the current dividend growth rate also rises, leading him to
forecast higher dividends in the future as well. Analogously, in our model,
a series of positive shocks to earnings leads the investor to raise the probability
that earnings changes are currently being generated by the trending regime 2,
leading him to make more bullish predictions for future earnings.
4.2. A formal model
We now present a mathematical model of the investor behavior described
above, and in Section 5, we check that the intuition can be formalized. Suppose
that earnings at time t are N "N #y , where y is the shock to earnings at
t
t~1
t
t
time t, which can take one of two values, #y or !y. Assume that all earnings
are paid out as dividends. The investor believes that the value of y is determined
t
by one of two models, Model 1 or Model 2, depending on the ‘state’ or ‘regime’
of the economy. Models 1 and 2 have the same structure: they are both Markov
processes, in the sense that the value taken by y depends only on the value taken
t
by y . The essential difference between the two processes lies in the transition
t~1
probabilities. To be precise, the transition matrices for the two models are:
Model 1

The key is that n is small and n is large. We shall think of n as falling
L

between zero and 0.5, with p falling between 0.5 and one. In other words, under
H
Model 1 a positive shock is likely to be reversed; under Model 2, a positive shock
is more likely to be followed by another positive shock.
The investor is convinced that he knows the parameters n and n ; he is also
L
H
sure that he is right about the underlying process controlling the switching from
one regime to another, or equivalently from Models 1 to 2. It, too, is Markov, so
that the state of the world today depends only on the state of the world in the
previous period. The transition matrix is

and the earnings shock in period t, y , is generated by Model 1; similarly if s "2,
t
t
we are in the second regime and the earnings shock is generated by Model 2. The
parameters j and j determine the probabilities of transition from one state to
1
2
another. We focus particularly on small j and j , which means that transitions
1
2
from one state to another occur rarely. In particular, we assume that
j #j (1. We also think of j as being smaller than j . Since the uncondi1
2

2
tional probability of being in state 1 is j /(j #j ), this implies that the investor
2 1
2
thinks of Model 1 as being more likely than Model 2, on average. Our results do
not depend, however, on j being smaller than j . The effects that we document
1
2
can also obtain if j 'j .

2
In order to value the security, the investor needs to forecast earnings into the
future. Since the model he is using dictates that earnings at any time are
generated by one of two regimes, the investor sees his task as trying to
understand which of the two regimes is currently governing earnings. He
observes earnings each period and uses that information to make as good
a guess as possible about which regime he is in. In particular, at time t, having
observed the earnings shock y , he calculates q , the probability that y was
t

generated by Model 1, using the new data to update his estimate from the

In particular, if the shock to earnings in period t#1, y , is the same as the
t`1
shock in period t, y , the investor updates q

and in this case, q 'q and the weight on Model 1 increases.

To aid intuition about how the model works, we present a simple example
shown in Table 1. Suppose that in period 0, the shock to earnings y is positive
0
and the probability assigned to Model 1 by the investor, i.e., q , is 0.5. For
0
a randomly generated earnings stream over the next 20 periods, the table below
presents the investor’s belief q that the time t shock to earnings is generated by
t
Model 1. The particular parameter values chosen here are n "1(3"n , and
L 3 4
H
j "0.1(0.3"j . Note again that the earnings stream is generated using the
1
2
true process for earnings, a random walk.
In periods 0—4, positive shocks to earnings alternate with negative shocks.
Since Model 1 stipulates that earnings shocks are likely to be reversed in the
following period, we observe an increase in q , the probability that Model 1 is
t
generating the earnings shock at time t, rising to a high of 0.94 in period 4. From
periods 10 to 14, we observe five successive positive shocks; since this is behavior
typical of that specified by Model 2, q falls through period 14 to a low of 0.36.

One feature that is evident in the above example is that q rises if the earnings
t
shock in period t has the opposite sign from that in period t!1 and falls if the
shock in period t has the same sign as that in period t!1.

5. Model solution and empirical implications
5.1. Basic results
We now analyze the implications of our model for prices. Since our model has
a representative agent, the price of the security is simply the value of the security
as perceived by the investor. In other words

Note that the expectations in this expression are the expectations of the investor
who does not realize that the true process for earnings is a random walk. Indeed,
if the investor did realize this, the series above would be simple enough to
evaluate since under a random walk, E (N )"N , and price equals N /d. In
t t`j
t
t
our model, price deviates from this correct value because the investor does not
use the random walk model to forecast earnings, but rather some combination
of Models 1 and 2, neither of which is a random walk. The following proposition, proved in the Appendix, summarizes the behavior of prices in this context,
and shows that they depend on the state variables in a particularly simple way.
Proposition 1. If the investor believes that earnings are generated by the regimeswitching model described in Section 4, then prices satisfy

where p and p are constants that depend on n , n , j , and j . ¹he full

expressions for p and p are given in the Appendix.11

2
The formula for P has a very simple interpretation. The first term, N /d, is the
t
t
price that would obtain if the investor used the true random walk process to
forecast earnings. The second term, y (p !p q ), gives the deviation of price
t 1
2 t
from this fundamental value. Later in this section we look at the range of values

11 It is difficult to prove general results about p and p , although numerical computations show

that p and p are both positive over most of the range of values of n , n , j , and j we are interested

in.

325

of n , n , j , and j that allow the price function in Proposition 1 to exhibit both
L H 1
2
underreaction and overreaction to earnings news. In fact, Proposition 2 below
gives sufficient conditions on p and p to ensure that this is the case. For the
1
2
next few paragraphs, in the run-up to Proposition 2, we forsake mathematical
rigor in order to build intuition for those conditions.
First, note that if the price function P is to exhibit underreaction to earnings
t
news, on average, then p cannot be too large in relation to p . Suppose the
1
2
latest earnings shock y is a positive one. Underreaction means that, on average,
t
the stock price does not react sufficiently to this shock, leaving the price below
fundamental value. This means that, on average, y(p !p q ), the deviation from
1
2 t
fundamental value, must be negative. If q denotes an average value of q , this
!7'
t
implies that we must have p (p q . This is the sense in which p cannot be
1
2 !7'
1
too large in relation to p .
2
On the other hand, if P is also to display overreaction to sequences of similar
t
earnings news, then p cannot be too small in relation to p . Suppose that the
1
2
investor has just observed a series of good earnings shocks. Overreaction would
require that price now be above fundamental value. Moreover, we know that
after a series of shocks of the same sign, q is normally low, indicating a low
t
weight on Model 1 and a high weight on Model 2. If we write q to represent
-08
a typical low value of q , overreaction then requires that y(p !p q ) be
t
1
2 -08
positive, or that p 'p q . This is the sense in which p cannot be too small in
1
2 -08
1
relation to p . Putting the two conditions together, we obtain
2
p q (p (p q .
2 -08
1
2 !7'
In Proposition 2, we provide sufficient conditions on p and p for prices to
1
2
exhibit both underreaction and overreaction, and their form is very similar to
what we have just obtained. In fact, the argument in Proposition 2 is essentially
the one we have just made, although some effort is required to make the
reasoning rigorous.
Before stating the proposition, we repeat the definitions of overreaction and
underreaction that were presented in Section 2. Overreaction can be thought of
as meaning that the expected return following a sufficiently large number of
positive shocks should be lower than the expected return following the same
number of successive negative shocks. In other words, there exists some number
J*1, such that for all j*J,

Proposition 2 below provides sufficient conditions on n , n , j , and j for
L H 1

these two inequalities to hold.12
Proposition 2. If the underlying parameters n , n , j , and j satisfy

then the price function in Proposition 1 exhibits both underreaction and overreaction to earnings; k and kM are positive constants that depend on n , n , j , and
L H 1
1
j (the full expressions
are given in the Appendix).
2
We now examine the range of values of the fundamental parameters n , n , j ,
H L 1
and j for which the sufficient conditions for both underreaction and overreac2
tion are satisfied. Since the conditions in Proposition 2 are somewhat involved,
we evaluate them numerically for a large range of values of the four underlying
parameters. Fig. 1 illustrates one such exercise. We start by fixing j "0.1 and
1
j "0.3. These numbers are small to ensure that regime switches do not occur
2
very often and j 'j to represent the investor’s belief that the world is in the
2
1
Model 1 regime more often than in the Model 2 regime.
Now that j and j have been fixed, we want to know the range of values of
1
2
n and n for which the conditions for underreaction and overreaction both
L
H
hold. Given the way the model is set up, n and n are restricted to the ranges
L
H
0(n (0.5 and 0.5(n (1. We evaluate the conditions in Proposition 2 for
L

pairs of (n , n ) where n ranges from zero to 0.5 at intervals of 0.01 and
L H

n ranges from 0.5 to one, again at intervals of 0.01.

The graph at the top of Fig. 1 marks with a # all the pairs for which the
sufficient conditions hold. We see that underreaction and overreaction hold for
a wide range of values. On the other hand, it is not a trivial result: there are many
parameter values for which at least one of the two phenomena does not hold.
The graph shows that the sufficient conditions do not hold if both n and
L
n are near the high end of their feasible ranges, or if both n and n are near the
H
L
H
low end of their ranges. The reason for this is the following. Suppose both n and
L
n are high. This means that whatever the regime, the investor believes that

shocks are relatively likely to be followed by another shock of the same sign. The

t
a positive change in earnings, rather than better-than-expected earnings. Since the expected change
in earnings E (y ) always lies between !y and #y, a positive earnings change is in fact a positive
t t`1
surprise. Therefore, the results are qualitatively the same in the two cases. In the simulations in
Section 5.2, we calculate returns in the usual way, and condition on earnings surprises as well as raw
earnings changes.

regimes.

consequence of this is that overreaction certainly obtains, although underreaction might not. Following a positive shock, the investor on average expects
another positive shock and since the true process is a random walk, returns are
negative, on average. Hence the average return following a positive shock is
lower than that following a negative shock, which is a characterization of
overreaction rather than of underreaction.
On the other hand, if n and n are both at the low end, the investor believes
L
H
that shocks are relatively likely to be reversed, regardless of the regime: this leads
to underreaction, but overreaction might not hold.
To confirm this intuition, we also show in Fig. 1 the ranges of (n , n ) pairs for
L H
which only underreaction or only overreaction holds. The graph at bottom left
shows the parameter values for which only overreaction obtains, while the graph
to its right shows the values for which only underreaction holds. The intersection of the two regions is the original one shown in the graph at the top. These
figures confirm the intuition that if n and n are on the high side, overreaction
L
H
obtains, but underreaction might not.

5.2. Some simulation experiments
One way of evaluating our framework is to try to replicate the empirical

in the region for which prices should exhibit both underreaction and overreaction.
Our aim is to simulate earnings, prices, and returns for a large number of firms
over time. Accordingly, we choose an initial level of earnings N and use the true
1
random walk model to simulate 2000 independent earnings sequences, each one

<-----Page 22----->N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

329

starting at N . Each sequence represents a different firm and contains six
1
earnings realizations. We think of a period in our model as corresponding
roughly to a year, so that our simulated data set covers six years. For the
parameter values chosen, we can then apply the formula derived in Section 5.1
to calculate prices and returns.
One feature of the random walk model we use for earnings is that it imposes
a constant volatility for the earnings shock y , rather than making this volatility
t
proportional to the level of earnings N . While this makes our model tractable
t
enough to calculate the price function in closed form, it also allows earnings, and
hence prices, to turn negative. In our simulations, we choose the absolute value
of the earnings change y to be small relative to the initial earnings level N so as
1
to avoid generating negative earnings. Since this choice has the effect of reducing
the volatility of returns in our simulated samples, we pay more attention to the
sign of the numbers we present than to their absolute magnitudes.
This aspect of our model also motivates us to set the sample length at
a relatively short six years. For any given initial level of earnings, the longer the
sample length, the greater is the chance of earnings turning negative in the
sample. We therefore choose the shortest sample that still allows us to condition
on earnings and price histories of the length typical in empirical analyses.
A natural starting point is to use the simulated data to calculate returns
following particular realizations of earnings. For each n-year period in the
sample, where n can range from one to four, we form two portfolios. One
portfolio consists of all the firms with positive earnings changes in each of the
n years, and the other of all the firms with negative earnings changes in each of
the n years. We calculate the difference between the returns on these two
portfolios in the year after formation. We repeat this procedure for all the n-year
periods in the sample and calculate the time series mean of the difference in the
two portfolio returns, which we call rn !rn .
~
`
The calculation of rn !rn for the case of n"1 essentially replicates the
~
`
empirical analysis in studies such as that of Bernard and Thomas (1989). This
quantity should therefore be positive, matching our definition of underreaction
to news. Furthermore, to match our definition of overreaction, we need the
average return in periods following a long series of consecutive positive earnings
shocks to be lower than the average return following a similarly long series of
negative shocks. Therefore, we hope to see rn !rn decline as n grows, or as we
~
`
condition on a progressively longer string of earnings shocks of the same sign,
indicating a transition from underreaction to overreaction. Table 2 below reports the results.
The results display the pattern we expect. The average return following
a positive earnings shock is greater than the average return following a negative
shock, consistent with underreaction. As the number of shocks of the same sign
increases, the difference in average returns turns negative, consistent with
overreaction.

While the magnitudes of the numbers in the table are quite reasonable, their
absolute values are smaller than those found in the empirical literature. This is
a direct consequence of the low volatility of earnings changes that we impose to
prevent earnings from turning negative in our simulations. Moreover, we report
only point estimates and do not try to address the issue of statistical significance.
Doing so would require more structure than we have imposed so far, such as
assumptions about the cross-sectional covariance properties of earnings
changes.
An alternative computation to the one reported in the table above would
condition not on raw earnings but on the size of the surprise in the earnings
announcement, measured relative to the investor’s forecast. We have tried this
calculation as well, and obtained very similar results.
Some of the studies discussed in Section 2, such as Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993) and De Bondt and Thaler (1985), calculate returns conditional not on
previous earnings realizations but on previous realizations of returns. We now
attempt to replicate these studies.
For each n-year period in our simulated sample, where n again ranges from
one to four, we group the 2000 firms into deciles based on their cumulative
return over the n years, and compute the difference between the return of the
best- and the worst-performing deciles for the year after portfolio formation. We
repeat this for all the n-year periods in our sample, and compute the time series
mean of the difference in the two portfolio returns, rn !rn .

We hope to find that rn !rn decreases with n, with r1 !r1 positive just as in

Jegadeesh and Titman and r4 !r4 negative as in De Bondt and Thaler. The

results, shown in Table 3, are precisely these.
Finally, we can also use our simulated data to try to replicate one more widely
reported empirical finding, namely the predictive power of earnings-price (E/P)
ratios for the cross-section of returns. Each year, we group the 2000 stocks into
deciles based on their E/P ratio and compute the difference between the return
on the highest E/P decile and the return on the lowest E/P decile in the year after
formation. We repeat this for each of the years in our sample and compute
the time series mean of the difference in the two portfolio returns, which we
call r)* !r-0 . We find this statistic to be large and positive, matching

Note that this difference in average returns cannot be the result of a risk

5.3. The event studies revisited
We have already discussed the direct relationship between the concept of
conservatism, the specification of regime 1 in our model, and the pervasive
evidence of underreaction in event studies. We believe that regime 1 is consistent
with the almost universal finding across different information events that stock
prices tend to drift in the same direction as the event announcement return for
a period of six months to five years, with the length of the time period dependent
on the type of event.
An important question is whether our full model, and not just regime 1, is
consistent with all of the event study evidence. Michaely et al. (1995) find that
stock prices of dividend-cutting firms decline on the announcement of the cut
but then continue falling for some time afterwards. This finding is consistent
with our regime 1 in that it involves underreaction to the new and useful
information contained in the cut. But we also know that dividend cuts generally
occur after a string of bad earnings news. Hence, if a long string of bad earnings
news pushes investors towards believing in regime 2, another piece of bad news
such as a dividend cut would perhaps cause an overreaction rather than an
underreaction in our model.13
While this certainly is one interpretation of our model, an alternative way of
thinking about dividend announcements is consistent with both our model and
13 Another study that presents a similar puzzle is by Ikenberry et al. (1996). They find that the
positive price reaction to the announcement of a stock split is followed by a substantial drift in the
same direction over the next few years. However, the split is also often preceded by a persistent
run-up in the stock price, suggesting an overreaction that should ultimately be reversed.

<-----Page 25----->332

N. Barberis et al./Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

the evidence. Specifically, our model only predicts an overreaction when the new
information is part of a long string of similar numbers, such as earnings or sales
figures. An isolated information event such as a dividend cut, an insider sale of
stock, or a primary stock issue by the firm does not constitute part of the string,
even though it could superficially be classified as good news or bad news like the
earnings numbers that preceded it. Investors need not simply classify all information events, whatever their nature, as either good or bad news and then
claim to see a trend on this basis. Instead, they may form forecasts of earnings
or sales using the time series for those variables and extrapolate past trends
too far into the future. Under this interpretation, our model is consistent
with an overreaction to a long string of bad earnings news and the underweighting of informative bad news of a different type which arrives shortly
afterwards.
A related empirical finding is that even for extreme growth stocks that have
had several consecutive years of positive earnings news, there is underreaction to
quarterly earnings surprises. Our model cannot account for this evidence since it
would predict overreaction in this case. To explain this evidence, our model
needs to be extended. One possible way to extend the model is to allow investors
to estimate the level and the growth rate of earnings separately. Indeed, in
reality, investors might use annual earnings numbers over five to seven years to
estimate the growth rate but higher frequency quarterly earnings announcements (perhaps combined with other information) to estimate earnings levels.
Suppose, for example, that earnings have been growing rapidly over five years,
so that an investor using the representativeness heuristic makes an overly
optimistic forecast of the future growth rate. Suppose then that a very positive
earnings number is announced. Holding the estimated long-run growth rate of
earnings constant, investors might still underreact to the quarterly earnings
announcement given the high weight this number has for predicting the level of
earnings when earnings follow a random walk. That is, if such a model is
contructed, it can predict underreaction to earnings news in glamour stocks.
Such a model could therefore account for more of the available evidence than
our simple model.

6. Conclusion
We have presented a parsimonious model of investor sentiment, or of how
investors form expectations of future earnings. The model we propose is motivated by a variety of psychological evidence, and in particular by the idea of
Griffin and Tversky (1992) that, in making forecasts, people pay too much
attention to the strength of the evidence they are presented with and too
little attention to its statistical weight. We have supposed that corporate
announcements such as those of earnings represent information that is of low

<-----Page 26----->N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343

333

strength but significant statistical weight. This assumption has yielded the
prediction that stock prices underreact to earnings announcements and similar
events. We have further assumed that consistent patterns of news, such as series
of good earnings announcements, represent information that is of high strength
and low weight. This assumption has yielded a prediction that stock prices
overreact to consistent patterns of good or bad news.
Our paper makes reasonable, and empirically supportable, assumptions
about the strength and weight of different pieces of evidence and derives
empirical implications from these assumptions. However, to push this research
further, it is important to develop an priori way of classifying events by their
strength and weight, and to make further predictions based on such a classification. The Griffin and Tversky theory predicts most importantly that, holding the
weight of information constant, news with more strength would generate a bigger reaction from investors. If news can be classified on a priori grounds, this
prediction is testable.
Specifically, the theory predicts that, holding the weight of information
constant, one-time strong news events should generate an overreaction. We
have not discussed any evidence bearing on this prediction in the paper.
However, there does appear to be some evidence consistent with this prediction.
For example, stock prices bounced back strongly in the few weeks after the crash
of 1987. One interpretation of the crash is that investors overreacted to the news
of panic selling by other investors even though there was little fundamental news
about security values. Thus the crash was a high-strength, low-weight news
event which, according to the theory, should have caused an overreaction. Stein
(1989) relatedly finds that long-term option prices overreact to innovations in
volatility, another potentially high-strength, low-weight event, since volatility
tends to be highly mean-reverting. And Klibanoff et al. (1998) find that the price
of a closed-end country fund reacts more strongly to news about its fundamentals when the country whose stocks the fund holds appears on the front page
of the newspaper. That is, increasing the strength of the news, holding the weight
constant, increases the price reaction. All these are bits of information consistent
with the broader implications of the theory. A real test, however, must
await a better and more objective way of estimating the strength of news
announcements.

Proof of proposition 2: Before we enter the main argument of the proof, we
present a short discussion of the behavior of q , the probability assigned by the
t
investor at time t to being in regime 1. Suppose that the earnings shock at time

We are now ready to begin the main argument of the proof. Underreaction

which is one of the sufficient conditions given in the proposition.
We now turn to a sufficient condition for underreaction. The definition of
underreaction can also be succinctly stated in terms of f (q) as
E ( f (q))'0,
q
where E denotes an expectation taken over the unconditional distribution of q.
q
Rewriting this, we obtain:
2yp E(q)!2yp #yp E (DM (q)#D(q))'0,

and hence,

(A.2)

Unfortunately, we are not yet finished because we do not have closed form
formulas for the expectations in this expression. To provide sufficient conditions,
we need to bound these quantities. In the remainder of the proof, we construct

<-----Page 33----->340

a number kM where
E (DM (q)#D(q))
.
kM (E(q)# q

This makes p (p kM a sufficient condition for Eq. (A.2). Of course, this assumes
1

that p *0, and so we impose this as an additional constraint to be satisfied. In
2
practice, we find that for the ranges of n , n , j , and j allowed by the model,
L H 1

p is always positive. However, we do not attempt a proof of this.

The first step in bounding the expression E(q)#1E (DM (q)#D(q)) is to bound

E(q). To do this, note that

Consider the function g(q) defined on [q, qN ]. The idea is to bound this function
above and below over this interval by straight
lines, parallel to the line passing
1
through the endpoints of g(q), namely (q, g(q)) and (qN , g(qN )). In other words,
1
1
suppose that we bound g(q) above by gN (q)"a#bq.
The slope of this line is
g(qN )!g(q) (qN !q)!1(D(qN )#DM (q))

argument produces a lower bound qe.

The final step before completing the argument is to note that since DM (q) and D(q)

are both concave, DM (q)#D(q) is also concave, so that
