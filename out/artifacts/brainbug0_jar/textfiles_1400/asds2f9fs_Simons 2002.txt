Abstract
This paper focuses on the perceived pattern of alignment between a manager's words and deeds, with special attention to
promise keeping, and espoused and enacted values. It terms this
perceived pattern of alignment "Behavioral Integrity." The literatures on trust, psychological contracts, and credibility combine to suggest important consequences for this perception, and
literatures on hypocrisy, social accounts, social cognition, organizational change, and management fashions suggest key antecedents to it. The resulting conceptual model highlights an
issue that is problematic in today's managerial environment, has
important organizational outcomes, and is relatively unstudied.
(Trust;Psychological Contracts;Credibility;Fashions)

A rapidly growing body of literaturerecognizes that trust
plays a central role in employment relationships. Though
scholars have varied somewhat in their specific definitions of trust, there is substantial agreement that a perception that another's words tend to align with his deeds
is critically important for the development of trust (e.g.,
McGregor 1967). Credibility has received recent attention in the practitioner literature (Kouzes and Posner
1993) as a critical managerial attributethat is all too often
undermined by managers' word-deed misalignment. In a
similar vein, psychological contracts research has proliferated in recent years, due in part to its relevance in the
recent managerial environment of widespread downsizing and restructuring because these processes are often
understood by workers as violations of employers' commitments (Robinson 1996). This paper contends that the
perceived pattern of managers' word-deed alignment or
misalignment-with regard to a variety of issues-is itself an important organizational phenomenon because it
is a critical antecedent to trust and credibility. This perception is affected not only by management's adherence

to psychological contracts, but also by phenomena that
are less immediate or close to the employee, such as managers' behavioral adherence to espoused values, mission
statements, and other short- and long-term commitments
and self-descriptions. Focusing attention on the perception of managers' word-deed alignment highlights several
organizational phenomena as likely sources of influence
upon both the managers' actual word-deed alignment and
employees' perception of it. Further,this focus generates
testable research propositions and practical suggestions
for managing employee trust in management and the consequent organizational outcomes. This paper will argue
that this perception, which we term "behavioral integrity," warrants further study because of its central conceptual role and because of its potential for managerial
prescription.
Trust has become widely recognized as a central outcome and antecedent in organizational studies. Trust,
however, is a very complex construct that is variously
conceived to include a wide range of cognitions, emotions, attitudes, and actions (Kramer 1999). The psychological contract is powerful in its relevance and its implications, but applies only to reciprocal commitments
that are proximal to the employee-it does not address
the far wider range of perceived managerial word-deed
misalignments which, this paper argues, seriously undermine trust in management relationships. Behavioral integrity (BI) is proposed here as a central but manageable
antecedent to trust that describes a wider range of organizational experiences than the psychological contract.
The present work hopes to promote and structureinquiry
into this realm.
Figure 1 shows a model of the conceptual linkages that
will be argued here. This paper will first draw from literatures on trust, credibility, and psychological contracts
to delineate the construct of behavioral integrity and its
organizational consequences (Figure 1, Block A). As BI

is a subjectively perceived phenomenon, literatures on
social cognition and social accounts describe the conditions under which actual managerial word-deed alignment or misalignment will be perceived and interpreted
in such a way as to influence ascriptions of behavioral
integrity (Figure 1, Block B). Finally, literatures on institutional tasks, managerial fashions, and organizational
change will be used to consider causes of actual managerial word-deed alignment or misalignment, which in
turn serves as the basis for perception (Figure 1, Block
C). As can be inferred from the literatures invoked, this
model crosses levels of analysis, from institutional and
organizational forces to manager responses to employee
perceptions of and reactions to managers and back to organizational outcomes.

Construct Definition
Behavioral Integrity (BI) Is the Perceived Pattern of
Alignment Between an Actor's Words and Deeds. It entails both the perceived fit between espoused and enacted
values, and perceived promise-keeping. Thus, it includes
the perception of behavioral adherence to psychological
contracts, as well as to mission statements, corporate
value statements, descriptions of individual values, priorities, or management styles, and simple follow-through
on expressed commitments. In an organizational context,

BI is typically conceived as employees' perceptions of
their managers' pattern of word-deed alignment, but applications in other contexts are readily conceivable. Because BI is a perceived pattern of alignment or misalignment, generally based on observations over time, it entails
internal attributions and may be considered an ascribed
"trait."
In other words, BI is the extent to which employees
perceive that their managers tend to representthemselves
and their motivating values accurately in their communications with employees. BI is the extent to which employees believe a manager "walks her talk," and, conversely, it reflects the extent to which they see her as
"talking her walk."
The Random House College Dictionary (1975, p. 692)
defines integrity as "adherenceto moral and ethical principles." As defined here, though, BI does not consider the
morality of principles, but ratherfocuses on the extent to
which stated principles are seen as aligning with actions.
Thus, a colleague who openly advocates self-interest,
ratherthan the common good, as a basis for personal actions might be despised if one does not share his values.
However, such a colleague might be seen as having high
behavioral integrity if one can see clear alignment between word and deed. One might not support the colleague's actions or seek vulnerability to him, but at least
one knows that he means what he says. The behavioral
19

<-----Page 3----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

integrity definition used here draws on a secondary definition of integrity that describes elements fitting together
into a seamless whole, as in the integrity of a boat hull
(Random House 1975).
Perceivers can ascribe behavioral integrity or its lack
to an individual person, or to a group of people, such as
"this company's management" or "anyone over 31" or
"politicians." To facilitate presentation, present discussion will focus on ascription of BI to a single person.
While behavioral integrity is clearly a subjective assessment, it is based partly on the actor's conduct. Thus, one
might meaningfully aggregate many people's perceptions
of an actor's behavioral integrity to estimate, for example,
the effect of a manager's conduct on departmental outcomes.
Table 1 summarizes the key construct definitions used
in this exposition.

Related Constructs
Trust
While the construct of trust has received considerable recent attention, scholars have used diverse definitions of
the construct (Bigley and Pearce 1998, Kramer 1999).
Though there seems to be a shared intuitive "sense" of
the type of thing trust represents, specific definitions of
trust have focused on expectations, action patterns,intent,
risk and vulnerability, ethical justifiability, and/or value
congruence. The intent of this discussion is not to present
an exhaustive list of extant trust definitions-this task is
admirably pursued by Kramer (1999) and Bigley and

Pearce (1998). Instead, the intent is to establish the following points: (1) Within several widely used trust definitions, the perception or belief that another's words have
historically aligned with deeds is recognized either as a
central antecedent to trust, or as a component of trust
itself; (2) Trust definitions that include perceived worddeed alignment among other beliefs or perceptions as elements of trust itself risk short-circuitingthe scientific exploration of the interplay between the various antecedents
of trust.
Some definitions focus on trust as a psychological state
of willingness. Mayer et al. (1995, p. 712) present a definition of trust that has been widely cited in recent theoretical research (Rousseau et al. 1998). They define trust
as "the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the
other will perform a particular action important to the
trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control
the other party." According to Mayer et al., perceptions
of another's integrity, ability, and benevolence form the
three critical antecedents to trust. Mayer's et al.'s definition of trust will be used for the model development
element of the present article.
Other definitions of trust focus less on willingness and
more on the aspect of expectation or belief. Hosmer
(1995, p. 393) synthesizes definitions from previous work
and proposes that "trust is the reliance ... upon a voluntarily accepted duty on the part of another ... to recognize and protect the rights and interests of all others
engaged in a joint endeavor or economic exchange."
Robinson (1996) defines trust as "one's expectations or

Behavioral Integrity

beliefs about the likelihood that another's future actions
will be beneficial, or at least not detrimental,to one's own
interests." These positive expectations should be based
largely on the ascription of benevolence and value or goal
congruity.
Additional definitions of trust have emerged from economic traditions. Tyler and Kramer (1996) draw on
Williamson's (1993) game-theoretic definition of trust as
a probabilistic estimate of future cooperation. While this
definition shares evident characteristics with the aforementioned definitions, the notion of trust as a "probabilistic estimate," rather than as a "reliance upon" or a
"willingness," links to different scholarly traditions, generates different operationalizations, and points toward
different interventions. Such calculative trust conceptualizations draw upon the notion of value or goal congruity, but emphasize behavioral reliability as a formative
mechanism (Lewicki and Bunker 1996).
Sitkin and Roth (1993) take these two evident antecedents to trust-ascribed goal or value congruity and reliability-and link them to different constructs. They propose that trust emerges from the perception of another's
task-specific reliability, while mistrust emerges from perception of a more generalized value incongruity with the
other. This brief and incomplete sampling of trust definitions shows trust as a willingness to make oneself vulnerable and as an expectation of benevolent, cooperative,
or nonhindering actions. Various trust definitions emphasize perceived behavioral reliability and perceived goal
congruity as key drivers of trust and/or mistrust. We propose that BI is likely to affect trust and mistrust through
both the mechanisms of perceived reliability and of perceived value or goal congruity.
Lewicki and Bunker (1996) offer a longitudinal perspective for the role of behavioral integrity in the establishment of trust. In their conceptual framework,
"deterrence-based trust (sometimes called 'calculusbased trust') is based on constancy of behavior-that people will do what they say they are going to do" (p. 118).
Lewicki and Bunker propose a sequential development in
work relationships from calculus-based trust to more intimate, empathic, and exclusive forms of trust. These authors argue that a failure at any of these types of trust
precludes progress to the next level of trust. By this reasoning, a failure to "do what you say you are going to
do" might completely arrest the development of trust.
McAllister (1995) proposesa distinctionbetween cognitionbased trust, which is based on a perception of reliability
and dependability, and affect-based trust, which is based
on reciprocated care and concern. McAllister argues that
a perception of past follow-through on commitments-a
perception of BI-is critical for cognition-based trust (p.
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 1, January-February 2002

28). McAllister then develops a sequential argumentsimilar to Lewicki and Bunker's (1996). He proposes
cognition-based trust as a necessary precursor to the development of affect-based trust because people must be
confident in their expectations of another's reliability and
dependability before they make furtheremotional investment in a relationship (p. 30). Within both of these different frameworks, then, a person who is perceived as not
doing what he says might have substantial difficulties in
establishing any trust at all. These two frameworks suggest that a perception of behavioral integrity may be a
necessary condition for the establishment of trust. We
believe these arguments emerge from a sense of trust as
springing from behavioral reliability-that the speaker's
words provide the listener with some sense of certainty
regarding the actions that will follow.
A second way in which the perception of speech that
is misaligned with actions (or vice versa) undermines
trust is through norms of reciprocity, which, Fox (1974)
argues, emerge from an ascription of goal or value incongruity. Mistrust, it is often said, begets mistrust (Fox
1974, Zand 1972). If employees believe that their managers are unwilling to present them with unvarnishedrepresentations of their actual values, they can easily infer
that their managers do not trust them enough to tell the
truth. When employees perceive that their managers do
not trust them, they tend in turn to mistrust those managers (Fox 1974). Butler (1995) describes a cycle of reciprocity whereby if one party is not forthcoming, then the
other party in turn lowers his trust in the first, and becomes less likely to enact cooperative behavior. Zand
(1972, p. 230) describes this phenomenon in groups as a
"short-cycle feedback loop," whereby mistrust generates
cautious behaviors which, in turn, stimulate mistrust on
the part of others. Creed and Miles (1996, p. 19) focus
this reciprocity on the managerial relationship. They note
that managers initiate most vertical exchanges, and, in
consequence, whatever level of trust or mistrustis evident
in their actions will, through reciprocation, set the tone
for the relationship. Employees may interpret their perception of managers' poor word-deed alignment as a cue
that managers mistrust them, and respond by reciprocation.
Fox (1974) makes the argument that the reciprocity of
mistrust emerges from an employee's inference from
management's demonstration of mistrust that management must hold goals or values that are incompatible with
those of the employee. Thus, it is possible that employees' inferences will extend beyond the belief that the
manager has chosen to misrepresent priorities, and will
explore sinister guesses as to the content of the underlying "true"priorities. A subordinateis likely to reason as
21

<-----Page 5----->TONY SIMONS BehavioralIntegrity

follows: "If my manager does not trust me enough to
honestly account for her behavior, perhaps it is because
she is pursuing goals or values of which she knows I do
not approve." Employees might infer value incongruence
with their manager from their perception of their manager's word-deed misalignment and, thus, come to trust
that manager less. These arguments reinforce the notion
that behavioral integrity affects trust both through perceived behavioral reliability and through employee inferences about managers' goal or value congruity.
Several conceptualizations of trust have been explicitly
multidimensional. Mishra (1996, p. 265) draws on the
concept of willingness to be vulnerable, but borrows from
several other sources to define trust as "one party's willingness to be vulnerable to another party based on the
belief that the other party is (a) competent, (b) open, (c)
concerned, and (d) reliable." Cummings and Bromiley
(1996) take a similarly multipronged approach as they
propose that trust is one person's belief that another (a)
makes good-faith efforts to act in accordance with commitments, (b) was honest in the negotiations thatpreceded
such commitments, and (c) will not be excessively opportunistic in taking advantage.
These multidimensional approaches begin to blur the
lines between the phenomenon of trust and its antecedents. If trust is defined as having multiple component
beliefs, then what happens to trust when some of those
beliefs are held and some are not? Does trust function
additively, or according to the minimum component, or
is it computed in some other more intricate or contextspecific manner? Multidimensional trust definitions risk
short-circuiting the exploration of the relative importance
and interplay between the described components of trust.
While some theoretic work has begun to propose solutions to these questions (e.g., Kramer 1999), the operationalizations required for empirical testing, and the theories to be tested, have not developed widespread
agreement. For the purposes of the present concept development, we will accept that these multidimensional
trust definitions accord central causal impact to notions
similar to behavioral integrity, and we encourage proponents of multidimensional trust construct definitions to
articulate and examine the interplay between the different
elements that they propose comprise trust. We propose,
however, that research into this important area is facilitated by making a clear distinction between BI and the
more complex phenomenon of trust.
The well-documented notion that perceived alignment
between word and deed influences trust leads to the following proposition:
Increases or decreases in behavioral
integrity ascriptions will increase or decrease trust, rePROPOSITION 1.

spectively. This influence willfunction through the mechanisms of perceived reliability and perceived value or
goal congruence.
Credibility
Credibility, as discussed in the persuasion literature,is an
assessment of believability, or of whether a given speaker
is likely to provide messages that will be reliable guides
to belief and behavior (O'Keefe 1990). According to
Aristotle and to many contemporary rhetoric scholars,
ethos, or source credibility, is the most potent means of
persuasion (McCroskey and Young 1981). While common usage implies that credibility is an attribute of the
message sender, communications scholars consider it
rather to be a judgment (O'Keefe 1990) or an attitude
(McCroskey and Young 1981) on the partof the perceiver
with regard to a given communicator.
As has been the case with trust, the construct of credibility has often been considered to be multidimensional,
comprising the perceiver's assessment of the communicator's relevant knowledge, veracity, and good intentions
toward the perceiver (McCroskey and Young 1981). The
three agreed-upon dimensions of credibility parallel the
three critical antecedents to trust as detailed by Mayer et
al. (1995). Behavioral integrity probably most strongly
affects the latter two: veracity and good intentions or benevolence. Allowing a speaker's utterance to influence
one's important decisions and behavior places one in a
position of vulnerability to that speaker and is thus an
expression of trust. This discussion considers credibility,
then, to be an important subclass of the broaderphenomenon of trust.
The concept of source or communicator credibility has
been extensively researched in the study of attitudes and
attitude change. Laboratory studies of attitude change
have manipulated credibility through information about
the source's expertise on the subject and their motive to
misrepresent information through vested interest in the
outcome (Eagly and Chaiken 1993, Fiske and Taylor
1991). These manipulations are very relevant to marketers, as spokespeople and salespeople clearly vary on these
two attributes.Legal writings on witness credibility have
emphasized a third (and perhaps dominant) contributing
factor: Credibility may be seriously undermined by evidence of the witness's prior misrepresentationof related
or unrelated issues. "The fact that the witness previously
engaged in deception tends to show the witness has a
charactertraitfor untruthfulness,and in turnthe existence
of that character trait at least slightly increases the probability that the witness lied during his testimony" (Strong
1999, p. 150).

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 1, January-February2002

<-----Page 6----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

A few managerial texts and substantial social psychological research on attitudes have focused on credibility
issues that are central to the current work. Kouzes and
Posner (1993) argue that managers' credibility is necessary for the development of employee loyalty and commitment, and that its lack impedes a manager's effectiveness, as the managers' words lose power as instruments
of change. Leaders' exhortations of a new mission or a
new focus are processed by employees as simply a new
dogma or corporate presentation, and are not translated
into action. An executive quoted in Mishra (1996, p. 267)
describes this effect:
If they don't believe what I'm telling them, if they think it's all
a bunch of bull, don't expect them to go out there and work a
little harder or work a little different. They're not going to be
as receptive to change unless they understand and trust that the
things we're talking about are in fact true.

The extent to which employees are willing to be influenced by their managers' words is critical for effective
management and change implementation. Words are one
of a manager's most potent tools for guiding subordinates
at all levels of the company. When credibility is sacrificed, the manager damages that tool, and is forced into
additional actions to show when he "really means" what
he says. Kouzes and Posner argue that managers earn and
strengthen their credibility when they simply do what
they say they will do.
Scholars of various traditions would agree that the perception of behavioral integrity has a very direct impact
on credibility. Behavioral integrity is backward-looking
and focuses on the past pattern of alignment between
words and deeds. Credibility, on the other hand, is
forward-looking, and entails the extent to which the
speaker's statements can be relied upon to accurately
guide future action. Further,credibility is affected by assessments of expertise, veracity, and benevolence, while
BI takes into account only the perception of the speaker's
prior pattern of word-deed alignment. One might assert
that assessments of BI, based on past experience, are one
of a few key factors that affect judgments of managers'
credibility. BI is distinct from credibility, and we understand credibility to reflect a subset of the larger phenomenon of trust.
Psychological Contracts
The psychological contract is a construct that is closely
related to trust, and is seldom discussed without evoking
trust (Robinson 1996). "The term psychological contract
refers to an individual's beliefs regarding the terms and
conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between
that person and another party" (Rousseau and McLean
Parks 1993, p. 19). Psychological contracts differ from
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 1, January-February 2002

general employee expectations in that psychological contracts must emerge from perceived explicit or implicit
promises (Robinson 1996, Rousseau 1995, Rousseau and
McLean Parks 1993), and the perceived violation of these
promises tends to elicit a sense of "moral outrage"
(McLean Parks 1997). In the organizationalcontext, most
empirical research on psychological contractshas focused
on the employee's perception of the promises made by
the employer in exchange for the employee's service.
Given its promissory basis, employees perceive the violation of a psychological contract as a word-deed misalignment that undermines ascriptions of managers' integrity, and also undermines beliefs in managers'
benevolence (Robinson 1996). The mechanism that
Robinson proposes appears to apply to perceived worddeed misalignments in general. The perception of managers' adherence to psychological contracts may be considered as an especially potent antecedent to BI.
Many perceived managerial word-deed misalignments
are not psychological contract violations, but they would
still be expected to affect behavioral integrity. The manager who espouses participative,consensus decision making, but who ultimately forces his decisions on the group,
is vulnerable to accusations of low BI. The same is true
of the organization that proudly proclaims its commitment to customer service, but whose policies, incentives,
and daily management behavior belie that commitment.
Consider the employees at an organization that has undergone-and at different times espoused-multiple superficially implemented change efforts. As experienced
employees become increasingly cynical (Kanter and
Mirvis 1989), lofty management proclamations cease
even to influence employee expectations and their psychological contracts. However, the accumulation of perceived falsehoods, as they are seen as a pattern, affects
BI and thus affects employees' trust in management.
A psychological contracts argument might be applied
to account for the sort of problems described above (e.g.,
Rousseau 1995, pp. 80-82). However, a strict definition
of psychological contracts would limit discussion to the
direct exchange agreement between the employee and the
employer or manager. In the examples provided above, it
seems doubtful that the employee would interpret the
word-deed misalignments from so personal a standpoint,
or would experience responses as intense as moral outrage. These misalignments are not focused on the employee, and while they may be upsetting, they do not
substantially threaten the fundamental exchange agreement. However, in all these cases, some form of promissory breach or word-deed misalignment has occurred
that could well influence the relationship between manager and employee. The BI framework is more general
23

<-----Page 7----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

than psychological contracts, and focuses simply on the
employee's perception that the manager's words tend or
tend not to align with his deeds. This simple perception
is sufficient to account for substantial consequences.
The BI framework addresses a broad set of phenomena
that are in many ways similar in consequence to psychological contracts, but are not addressed by that construct.
The psychological contracts framework focuses on a set
of perceived word-deed alignments and misalignments
that directly regard the employee's well-being. In this
context, it focuses exclusively on the employee's perception of what is said or promised to them, and does not
consider the impact of the employer's treatmentof others
or the employer's general mode of conducting business,
except as those occurrences have implications for the employee's own contract. Both sorts of breach would be
considered as drivers of BI. BI considers proximal
breaches, but also considers those that have more distal
consequences.
Though the study of psychological contract violations
is relatively new, initial research results suggest that these
violations have important consequences. Rousseau and
McLean Parks (1993, p. 36) propose that "contract violation erodes trust, [and] undermines the employment relationship yielding lower employee contributions (e.g.,
performance and attendance) and lower employer investments (e.g., retention, promotion)." Blancero and
Johnson (1997) further proposed that psychological contract violation is likely to influence customer service employees's "discretionary service behaviors." Robinson
(1996) empirically explored the consequences of contract
breach, and found that a breach reduced trust and that this
reduction in turn reduced employee performance, intent
to remain with the organization, and civic virtue behavior.
The consequences of contract violation as described by
Rousseau and McLean Parks (1993), Robinson (1996),
and Blancero and Johnson (1997), as documented above,
should apply also to the broader phenomenon of behavioral integrity.
PROPOSITION 2. Trust will mediate positive relationships between BI and employee performance, intent to
remain, organization citizenship behavior, and discretionary service behavior.

The Attributes of Behavioral Integrity

The preceding discussion of the relationship between BI
and similar constructs informs our understanding of the
consequences of the BI construct, but comparison to similar constructs may also be used to further inform our
24

understanding of the nature of the construct itself. Specifically, behavioral integrity is understood as (1) a subjectively ascribed (2) trait that (3) may be unitary or
domain-specific, (4) may be ascribed to individuals or
groups, and that (5) exhibits asymmetry between its enhancement and diminishment. These five assertions will
be discussed in sequence.
BI Is Subjective. Trust, psychological contracts, and
credibility are all described as fundamentally subjective
in nature. Lewicki and Bunker (1996, p. 132) note that
"if trust has been broken in the eye of the beholder, it has
been broken." Rousseau and McLean Parks (1993) make
the same point about psychological contracts. Kouzes and
Posner (1993, p. xxii) note that "credibility is determined
by the constituents." Given this consistency across frameworks, it seems prudent to consider that the impact of
behavioral integrity emerges from the perceived pattern
of alignment between managerial words and deeds.
The subjective natureof this construct means that managing behavioral integrity is no simple feat. As Weick
(1995, p. 182) notes, "... when a manager walks the talk
in the eyes of one subordinate, that walking is seen as
insincere by someone else who links it with a different
set of words." The subjective nature of the BI construct
means that the perceiver is intimately involved in the way
BI is construed and that BI is likely to be influenced by
the actor, by the relationship between the actor and the
perceiver, and by the attributes,history, and state of mind
of the perceiver.
Despite this subjectivity, however, perceptions of behavioral integrity are at least somewhat influenced by the
actual object of perception-the actor's conduct. Individual differences between perceivers will influence assessments of BI, but these differences can be attenuated
through aggregation. Thus, an averaged perception by a
department's employees of their manager is likely to say
something meaningful about that manager's actions and/
or his ability to manage employee perceptions.
BI Is an Ascribed Trait. If a person's deeds do not align
with their words, the fundamental attribution error
(Heider 1958) proposes that perceivers will tend to attribute the actor's behavior to dispositional qualities rather
than to situational factors. Thus, observers tend to ascribe
misalignments to traits (for example, that a person is "insincere" or is a "hypocrite" or a "liar") rather than to a
more subtle account of the situational exigencies that motivated the behavior. Internalattributionswould be further
strengthened by the fact that BI reflects a perceived pattern of word-deed alignment observed over time (Kelley
1967). March (1979) argues that most people's implicit
understandingsof psychology include strong assumptions

2002

<-----Page 8----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

that actions are rationally chosen to optimize the actor's
pursuit of goals and values. This argument suggests that
even when the words and deeds in question are not explicitly focused on values, BI may often be understood
by observers as a pattern of alignment or misalignment
between the actor's espoused and enacted values. These
arguments in combination suggest that behavioral integrity is likely to be perceived as a trait or a relatively stable
attributeof the actor.
Is BI Unitary or Domain Specific? Lewicki et al. (1998)
describe trust as "confident positive expectations about
another's behavior," and mistrust as "confident negative
expectations... ." Lewicki et al. propose that both trust
and mistrust are domain specific, and that human relationships contain ambivalence and full, complex mixtures
of both trust and mistrust. This proposition that trust and
mistrust may not be polar opposites echoes that of Sitkin
and Roth (1993), but emphasizes that the two may well
be specific to particular domains. This assertion raises a
similar uncertainty regarding behavioral integrity: It is
not yet clear whether the ascription of behavioral integrity
is unitary or domain specific. For example, if one's manager truly means what she says when she expresses concern for customer service, but that same manager's talk
about participative management is so much smoke, does
the employee combine the two perceptions into a single
BI judgment, or two? It is possible that the breadth or
domain specificity of the ascription varies with the observer's personality or cultural traits. Ultimately, the
question can be addressed by empirical study.
Perceivers Ascribe BI at Multiple Levels. The entity to
which behavioral integrity is ascribed can be a person or
a group of people. Mayer and Davis (1996) note that in
small organizations, the organization and its top decision
makers are equivalent for the purposes of trust, but that
in larger organizations, it is harder to determine who
makes decisions; thus, in large organizations, the organization takes on a life of its own as a referent for trust.
These authors describe employees' "aggregate"levels of
trust or mistrust for management in their organizations.
Mishra (1996) describes trust as "multi-level," in that it
applies at different levels of hierarchy within organizations, and it also applies between organizations. Morrison
and Robinson (1997, p. 228) argue with respect to psychological contracts that the organization assumes an anthropomorphic identity in the eyes of the employee.
Rousseau (1995) similarly argues that employees tend to
perceive that the organization has made a commitment,
whether a promise was made by the owner, a manager,
or a recruiter. Similarly, BI, or its lack, can be ascribed

ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol.13, No. 1, January-February2002

to individual actors, or, in larger organizations, to "management" or "the administration." For organizations
where a particularleader is especially salient and is taken
to personify the organization, these two kinds of ascription might be indistinguishable.
Disconfirmability and the Ratchet Effect. There is an
asymmetry between the ease of confirming BI and violating it. Several researchershave argued that trustis slow
to build and quick to dissipate. Burt and Knez (1996, p.
83) point out that "trustbuilds incrementally, but distrust
has a more catastrophic quality." Kramer (1996) notes
that violations of trust are more vivid than confirmations.
Lewicki and Bunker (1996) describe calculus-based
(early) trust as being like the game of chutes and ladders:
trust builds in small steps, and a single misstep can cause
a dramatic setback. This apparent asymmetry in the development of trust has prompted some scholars to distinguish trust and mistrust as distinct constructs (e.g., Sitkin
and Roth 1993).
A social cognition approach can be used to explain
more parsimoniously the asymmetry in trustdevelopment
without bifurcating the trust construct. Reeder and
Brewer (1979) examine the issue of person-schemas, and
propose that different ascribed attributespresent different
evidentiary requirements for the confirmation or disconfirmation of an ascription. These researchersnote that the
schema for "hypocrite" is extremely difficult to disconfirm once it is applied; any episodes of truth-telling can
be easily construed as ultimately congruent with the overall schema because even a liar cannot lie all the time. A
single lie might be enough to earn the actor the label of
"liar,"but it would take many spoken truths to shed that
label. Thus, perceived word-deed misalignments exhibit
a ratchet effect on BI, where misalignments are tallied
aggressively, but alignments are accorded substantially
less weight.
Consideration of the asymmetry between the affirmation and disconfirmation of behavioral integrity leads to
the following proposition:
PROPOSITION 3. Over a given time span, increases in
BI should be small relative to decreases in BI. BI changes
more rapidly in a negative direction than in a positive
direction.

Social Cognition: When Will Word-Deed
Alignment or Misalignment Be
Perceived?
Employees may fail to notice and process any given piece
of evidence of managers' word-deed alignment or misalignment. Attention and cognitive energy are, after all,
25

<-----Page 9----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

constrained resources (March and Simon 1958), and employees do not perceive and process everything around
them. The following is a discussion of social cognition
research that considers situational and individual factors
that are likely to determine whether or not word-deed
alignments and misalignments are perceived and interpreted in terms of behavioral integrity. In Figure 1, the
discussion now focuses on Block B, "Perception and Interpretation."
Situational Factor: Bosses, Subordinates, and BI
The perception of behavioral integrity is likely to be
strongly influenced by hierarchical relationships. There is
evidence to suggest that subordinates are far more likely
to notice BI and its lack on the part of their managers
than the other way around. This implication arises from
research on attention and schema formation, and is further
supported by observations in the more applied research
on trust and leader credibility.
Observers' assessment of a manager's behavioral integrity is a perceptual and interpretationalprocess, and is
thus susceptible to distortions in social information processing. Berscheid et al. (1976) argue that employees focus substantial attention on their managers partly because
they depend on them for rewards, promotions, favorable
assignments, resources, and the like. As a result of this
combined attention and dependency, employees tend
readily to develop person-schemas for their managers
(Erber and Fiske 1984). These schemas, in turn, lead employees to draw increased dispositional implications from
managers' behavior, apparentlyto increase a sense of prediction and control (Berscheid et al. 1976, Erber and
Fiske 1984). This framework is echoed by Kramer's
(1996) notion of organization members as "vigilant and
ruminative intuitive auditors"of their managers. There is
substantial evidence from research on social cognition
that people devote attention to their bosses, that they think
about them often in their efforts to understandand predict
their bosses' behavior, and that their preferred explanation for their bosses' behavior is to ascribe that behavior
to personal traits or dispositions (Fiske and Taylor 1991).
The fundamental attribution bias appears to increase
when subordinates examine the behavior of their superiors (Erber and Fiske 1984, Fiske and Taylor 1991). A
manager who violates his word because of an environmental exigency is unlikely to receive "benefit of the
doubt" from his subordinates. This research suggests that
those subordinates are fairly likely to notice word-action
misalignment, and are likely to ascribe it to a personal
trait of the manager. Both these tendencies serve to increase the sensitivity of employees' BI ascriptions.
This examination of behavioral integrity in hierarchical
relationships leads to the following proposition:
26

PROPOSITION 4. Subordinates' perceptions of their
managers' BI is likely to be more sensitive to actual
word-deed misalignments than peer or superiors' evaluations of the same manager. This sensitivity might vary
with the magnitude of the dependency relationship.

Situational Factor: Importance of Focal Issue
A second situational factor that is likely to influence the
perception of BI is the importance of the espoused value,
mission, or behavior pattern to the perceiver. While the
discussion of organizational hierarchies focused on the
importance of the actor to the perceiver, this issue focuses
on the importance of the issue at hand to the perceiver.
Cacioppo and Petty's elaboration likelihood model
(1989) proposes that the personal relevance of a message
increases motivation for central cognitive processing,
which, in turn, influences attitudes. Thus, psychological
contract breaches, as perceived behavioral misalignments
with espoused exchange relationships, are extremely
likely to trigger ascriptions of low BI because the issue
at hand directly concerns the well-being of the perceiver,
and is thus salient. On the other hand, a manager's behavioral misalignment with an espoused value placed on,
for example, customer service, will be most salient to the
employee who personally places a high value on service.
This mechanism is described by Morrison and Robinson
(1997) as the impact of issue salience on perceptions of
unmet promises. Behavioral misalignment with espoused
values will be most noticeable to those for whom the espoused value is important, and who are actively trying to
translate that value into action. This notion is of practical
consequence because the employees who become alienated as a result of this process are likely to be the organization's best employees-those who most strongly support the organization's efforts to enact what it espouses.
Consideration of this mechanism gives rise to the following proposition:
PROPOSITION 5. The more an employee cares about the
focal issue, the more likely it is that the manager's relevant word-action alignments and misalignments will be
noticed and will thus affect the employee's ascription of
that manager's BI.

Situational Factor: Social Accounts
Managers sometimes offer explanations and apologies for
their behavior. Under certain specifiable circumstances,
these explanations and apologies can influence observers'
interpretations of a perceived word-deed misalignment.
There is a growing literature on the impact of explanations, excuses, and apologies on perceived injustices (reviewed by Bies 1987, Greenberg 1990) and the management of conflict (reviewed by Sitkin and Bies 1993). Bies

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCEIV1. 13, No. 1, January-February2002

<-----Page 10----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

(1987) describes a typology of accounts for perceived injustices, and notes that different kinds of accounts operate
in different ways.' A discussion of these types will clarify
the relationship between social accounts and behavioral
integrity. While this literature typically refers to the person doing the explaining as the "wrongdoer," this discussion will use the term "manager"to recall the behavioral integrity context and to allow the possibility that a
word-deed misalignment might not be ethically "wrong."
Causal accounts are attempts by the manager to disclaim responsibility for the action in question by showing
how it was necessitated or caused by external circumstances. By offering a causal account, a manager attempts
to modify employees' attributionsfor a given action. Because internal attributions for word-deed misalignment
are integral to the behavioral integrity judgment, a successful causal account will reduce the interpretation of
such misalignment as an indicator of behavioral integrity.
Ideological accounts attempt to evoke a superordinate
goal or a driving value to rectify perceptions of injustice.
It is an attempt to reframe the standardor value to which
the behavior is compared. From a behavioral integrity
perspective, an ideological account says, "Even though
my actions were not in line with stated value X, consider
that they were in line with stated value Y, which is more
important."A successful ideological account reduces the
perception of word-deed misalignment by changing the
words to which the deed is compared.
Referential accounts attempt to reduce the perception
of wrongdoing by reducing the subordinates' sense of an
unfavorable outcome. In essence, they say, "it is not so
bad" or "it could be worse." It is not clear that referential
accounts contribute meaningfully to the behavioral integrity framework.
Penitential accounts are apologies or expressions of
remorse for the action. In an apology, the actor accepts
responsibility for the action, but asserts that the action
does not represent what the actor is "really like" as a
person. The statement that an action was unintentional
represents something between a penitential account and
a causal account (Bies 1987). From a behavioral integrity
perspective, penitential accounts operate like causal accounts by attempting to modify the attributions that the
perceiver makes for the word-deed misalignment.
Social accounts are especially critical to the behavioral
integrity model because they represent the most straightforward and least costly way that a manager can influence
her subordinates' perception of her behavioral integrity.
Because of this ease, social accounts may be overused
(Sitkin and Bies 1993). The conditions under which social
accounts are effective is the subject of a healthy and ongoing research stream (reviewed by Bies 1987, Greenberg
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/VOl. 13, No. 1, January-February2002

1990, Sitkin and Bies 1993). Taken as a whole, this
stream of research suggests the following proposition:
PROPOSITION 6. Social accounts will tend to reduce
internal attributions for word-deed misalignments and
will thus reduce their impact on BI.

Individual Factor: Chronic Schema Accessibility
People develop habitual dimensions upon which they assess and describe other people, and these dimensions
would be considered to be chronically accessible to those
observers (Fiske and Taylor 1991). Some people evaluate
everyone they meet on intelligence; others might attune
their attention to kindness, others to assertiveness. People
who are chronicically attuned to a dimension are especially sensitive to it. They are more likely to notice that
attribute, given a set of information (Bargh and Pratto
1986), and they are able to consider that attributeat times
when nonchronics would be overloaded (Fiske and
Taylor 1991). Higgins and King (1981) found that people
for whom a given personality construct is chronically accessible are more likely to remember and describe other
people in those terms. Individual chronic construct or
schema accessibility tends to focus perception and recall.
While the construct of behavioral integrity is not a lay
construct, there are several lay constructs that approximate it, such as integrity, honesty, consistency, sincerity,
or hypocrisy. The following proposition emerges:
PROPOSITION 7. The perceiver's chronic accessibility
for lay constructs related to BI (e.g., integrity, honesty,
consistency, sincerity, or hypocrisy) will enhance the sensitivity of her BI ascriptions to managers' actual worddeed alignment or misalignment.

An Accelerating Loop at BI Perception: Vigilance
and the Priming Effect
Fiske and Taylor (1991) describe one of the fundamental
principles of social cognition in which people tend to look
primarily for evidence that supports their preexisting expectations, ratherthan considering the full arrayof available information. Schema-congruent information is more
readily perceived and recalled. Fiske and Taylor argue
that the schema-congruent recall effect is especially
pronounced when people are asked to make complex
judgments. The assessment of BI is complex, and so is
especially vulnerable to bias by prior expectations or
schema congruity. As people come to expect a given level
of BI, they filter their perceptions to confirm to their expectations. Thus, perceptions of behavioral integrity are
likely to develop a level of "inertia."This inertia might
account for Robinson's (1996) finding that employees
with a higher initial level of trust were less likely to perceive psychological contract breaches, and may, in the
27

<-----Page 11----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

face of strong positive beliefs, give rise to a perceptual
threshold effect for word-deed misalignment.
To this perceptual inertia is added an acceleration process: The priming effect (Bruner 1957, Fiske and Taylor
1991) describes how the cognitive accessibility of categories or perceptual dimensions can be stimulatedby simple reminders of that category. The priming of a schema
increases the likelihood of its subsequent application by
the perceiver (Fiske and Taylor 1991). Thus, people who
notice a lack of behavioral integrity on the part of another
are likely to become increasingly vigilant regarding the
construct of BI, and, perhaps, to interpret ambiguous
stimuli as further evidence for low BI.2 Rousseau (1995)
describes how employee mistrust of management and a
history of troubled relationships can trigger employees to
monitor their psychological contracts more closely, and
thus to increase the likelihood that they will notice
breaches. Morrison and Robinson (1997) describe the
phenomenon of vigilance as a factor that increases employees' noticing of unmet promises, and they point out
that breach influences trust, which in turn influences vigilance. Thus, the perception of word-deed misalignment
enhances readiness to perceive future word-deed misalignment. Consideration of this perceptual factor leads
to the following proposition:
PROPOSITION8. A perception of word-deed misalignment at Time 1 will, other things being equal, increase
the likelihood of noticing misalignment at Time 2.

Behavioral Antecedents: When Will
Managers' Words Actually Diverge
From Actions?
The preceding section considered factors that influence
the perception of managers' word-deed alignment given
a set of managerial words and deeds. The focus now shifts
to a consideration of factors that influence the manager's
actual alignment between words and deeds-which presumably serves as the basis for perception. We recognize
that such actual alignment is an abstraction that is not
measurable, as managers produce many words and many
deeds. However, the distinction between the actual worddeed alignment pattern and the perceived pattern is necessary for the differentiation of the various antecedents
to BI. With reference to Figure 1, we have completed
discussion of Block B and continue to move leftward in
the model to Block C.
Several management theorists have considered why
managers' espoused practices and values often diverge
from those they enact. Most of these arguments may be
condensed into three general observations:
28

(1) Diverse Demands. Managers are frequentlycharged
with the task of satisfying multiple, often contradictory,
constituencies, both inside and outside the organization.
Relaxed demands for consistency allow them to better
accomplish this task (Brunsson 1989, Meyer and Rowan
1977, Pfeffer 1981).
(2) Wishful Thinking. Language often helps shape reality. Thus, managers might espouse their stretch goals
and wishful thinking in an effort to elevate themselves
and their organizations through processes similar to selffulfilling prophecies and Pygmalion effects (Brunsson
1989, March 1979, Pfeffer 1992).
(3) Learning by Talking. Managers often figure out
what they value from reflecting on their utterances
(March 1979, Weick 1995). Constrainingmanagerialtalk
to issues that are already fully articulated might stifle
managerial learning and innovation processes (Brunsson
1989, March 1979, Pfeffer 1992, Weick 1995).
These three processes suggest that inconsistency has
potential benefits to organizations and to individual managers. Successful organizations and managers clearly
need to manage constituencies, to set goals, and to learn,
adapt, and change. Thus, the benefits described above are
important to organizational success. The following section will draw on these arguments and others to articulate
factors that are likely to cause managers' words and deeds
to diverge.
Industrial and Organizational Structure: Need to
Satisfy Diverse Stakeholders
Brunsson (1989) notes that divergence between espoused
and enacted values is often a reasonable effort at managing the perceptions of diverse constituencies. Further,
Brunsson notes that organizations and industries vary in
the extent to which managers must address the perceptions of diverse constituencies to garer resources and
legitimacy. In the government committees Brunsson studied, this need is high. In universities, the need is moderate, while a small manufacturerwould face relatively little of this challenge. Publicly traded organizations must
manage diverse stakeholders more than privately held
firms. The task demands of some managerialjobs, determined in part by industry and organization structure,encourage managers to represent themselves differently to
different constituencies. These diverse self-presentations,
when noticed by employees, can be expected to affect
behavioral integrity. Thus,
PROPOSITION 9. The greater an organization's need to
manage the perceptions of diverse stakeholders, the
lower the pattern of alignment between managers' words

Behavioral Integrity

and deeds, and thus the lower employees' ascriptions of
their managers' BI
Institutional Forces: Managerial Fads and Fashions
Managerial fads and fashions (Abrahamson 1991) and the
organizational and managerial responses to such fads are
another key source of low fit between words and actions.
Ghoshal and Bartlett (1996) note that the average company, between 1990 and 1994, had committed itself to
11.8 of 25 currently popular management tools and techniques. Abrahamson (1996) notes that fully a third of all
U.S. organizations with more than 500 employees reported adopting quality circles between 1980 and 1982,
including 90% of the Fortune 500. However, 80% of the
Fortune 500 companies that adopted quality circles in the
early 1980s had dropped them by 1987. It is clear that
several management practices have waxed and waned in
popularity, and that the cycle time of programacceptance
and rejection is at times quite rapid. Many companies
have taken to embracing and rejecting different managerial approaches in rapid sequence.
Abrahamson (1991) notes that management fashions
often serve the function of signaling innovativeness but
do little to boost economic profit, and speculates that one
explanation would be the notion that managerial technologies are seldom given a chance to work. Abrahamson
(1996) points out that constant change in espoused beliefs
about management is in part necessitated by the need of
managers to appear to be at the forefront of management
progress. Managers' individual needs to maintain a competitive edge drive them to use the latest, presumably
most advanced, managerialterminologies and techniques,
and give them an appetite for ever newer management
approaches, with which the competition is hopefully not
yet familiar. The 1980s saw an explosion of consultants
and management books as companies sought to respond
to new competitive threats by adopting new management
technologies. Much of the change process, though, focused on superficial trappings (Kouzes and Posner 1993,
p. 22). It is a profound irony that management practices
adopted to muster institutional credibility (Zucker 1986)
have in many cases had precisely the opposite effect in
the eyes of employees.
Meyer and Rowan (1977) argue that organizations
adopt widely accepted managerial practices to garer legitimacy and resources and to serve this symbolic function, these practices need not be fully integratedwith core
production activities; they may be "decoupled" from
them. Choi (1995) provides an excellent illustration of
this motive and process: He documents that several automotive parts suppliers, to qualify to sell to OEMs, implemented statistical process control (SPC) and other
ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol.13, No. 1, January-February2002

similar programs in a largely superficial manner. While
such implementation yielded little if any productivity
gains, it was sufficient to secure lucrative contracts.
When organizations experiment with managerial fashions, the first-and sometimes only-element they import is the jargon. Jobs are sometimes retitled, for example, in an effort to manage job prestige and employee
attitude. Shapiro (1995), however, argues that the use of
egalitarian language without concomitant change in underlying dynamics simply obscures the true power structure from less savvy employees and ultimately undermines their effectiveness. While it seems likely that new
terminology might influence how organization members
function, any lasting impact must be supported by a coordinated change effort (see e.g., Argyris 1970). In the
absence of such coordination, or when program support
is withdrawn or supplantedby a new management framework, remnants of the old language will often remain
within the organization after the underlying values have
been forgotten. When the language does not match the
reality, behavioral integrity is eroded.
Argyris (1990) notes that espoused and enacted "rulebooks" often diverge as a consequence of companies'
dabbling in managerial fads. When the official policies
and managerial philosophy statements of a company do
not match the way things really get done on a day-to-day
basis, smart organizational members learn quickly to discard the official rulebook and play by the true rules of the
game. The mismatch between the two "rulebooks" represents grounds for questioning the behavioral integrity
of an organization's management, because it is fundamentally an incongruence between the espoused and the
enacted. These considerations lead to two furtherpropositions:
PROPOSITION10. Sequentially

supplanted

organiza-

tional change projects will tend to reduce the actual
alignment between managers' words and deeds, and so
reduce BI. This effect might generalize to all failed organizational change efforts.
PROPOSITION11. The application of managerial tech-

nologies absent systematic integration will tend to reduce
the actual alignment between managers' words and
deeds, and so reduce BI.
Organizational Processes: Change
Managers' word-deed misalignments can emerge from
partial or sequential abortive change efforts, as detailed
above, but may also emerge during the process of sustained change efforts because change can lead to confusion and miscommunication, and different elements of
the organization frequently change at different paces.
29

<-----Page 13----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

Robinson (1996, p. 574) notes that "constant contract
change means increased opportunities for employees and
employers to misunderstand the agreement and to perceive a contract breach even when an actual breach did
not occur." Because the assessment of behavioral integrity is subjective, misunderstandings that emerge from
policies and procedures in flux can reduce employees'
ascriptions of their managers' behavioral integrity. Further, different elements within the organization's structure are likely to adopt new approaches at different paces.
When this occurs, employees will often hear different
"messages" from different parts of the organization.
Change can also threaten word-action fit as managers
verbally express their hopes for what the organization is
to become. When and if these hopes prove infeasible,
employees may ascribe the resulting gap between word
and deed-or promise and follow-through-to managers'
low behavioral integrity. Brunsson (1989) describes managers' talk as an expression of wishful thinking, while
production is an expression of what is practical. Brunsson
(1993) notes that limits in knowledge, resources, and opportunities for control often constrain the implementation
of wishes. These unimplemented decisions, in turn, are
often interpreted as hypocrisy (Pfeffer 1992). While this
argument sounds disparaging of unrealistic managers,
there is certainly value in stretching for the impractical,
as the very ideas which best express ideals and aspirations
are often difficult to implement (Brunsson 1993). However, the process of managers laying out broad "visions"
that are not immediately implemented may be perceived
by employees as word-deed misalignment, and thus affect
ascriptions of managerial behavioral integrity.
Managerial talk may also diverge from action as a part
of learning. March (1979, p. 79) describes divergence between the espoused and the enacted as bad actions with
good intentions: "A bad man with good intentions may
be a man experimenting with the possibility of becoming
good." Thus, much managerial espousal of notions like
empowerment may be a function of their personal experimentation. Weick (1995) proposes that managers' talk is
a vital part of their sensemaking process, and that overemphasis on consistency is likely to cause managers to
limit their explorations to issues that are already well
known-in short, to cease experimentation and learning.
Divergence between words and deeds can emerge from
managers' self-improvement efforts.
Organizational change processes seem almost inevitably to risk employee perceptions of low BI, because
different elements of the organization change at different
speeds and are thus temporarily misaligned, and managers speak of hopes and policies as yet unimplemented,
and explore, experiment, and experience confusion.
30

These consequences of change warrant consideration
when organizations contemplate change, and they call for
careful management when organizations undertake
change.
PROPOSITION12. Organizational change processes,
ceterus paribus, entail a risk of generating real or perceived misalignments between managers' words and
deeds, and thus reducing BI. Employee ascriptions of
managers' behavioral integrity are likely to be lower during times of organizational transition than during times
of stability.

Organizational Processes: Poorly Integrated or
Inconsistent Policies
Policies, procedures, and goals that are mutually incompatible, or ineffective in their stated purposes, can be perceived by employees as word-deed misalignments. Mayer
and Davis (1996) found that replacement of a performance appraisal system that was perceived to be invalid
with one perceived to be valid increased employee trust
in management. Sitkin and Stickel (1996) describe a trust
problem that emerged from managerial control systems
that were perceived to be incongruent with the performed
tasks.3 It is evident that ineffective policies and procedures can undermine employee trust in management.This
undermining might emerge from perceptions of poor behavioral integrity, perceptions of value incongruence, a
combination of the two, or questions about managerial
competence. The above discussion suggests the following
proposition:
PROPOSITION 13. Policies and procedures that do not
accomplish their stated intent are often perceived as misalignments between managers' words and deeds, and so
are likely to reduce BI.

Individual Processes: Ambivalent Responses to
Change
Word-deed misalignment can also emerge from managers' individual resistance to change efforts. In such cases,
the manager will often try to put up an appearance of
supporting the change project while actual behavior remains unchanged (Schein 1992). Shapiro (1995, p. 91)
describes the ambivalent or insecure manager's response
to empowerment programs as "sabotage," and admonishes such managers to refrain from using empowerment
jargon because this use will only raise false expectations
on the part of employees. When managers find themselves torn between the demands of their superiors and
their personal preferences, or between the management
practices they believe to be desirable and those with
which they feel most comfortable, they are likely to send
different messages through their words and their actions.
ORGANIZATION

<-----Page 14----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

PROPOSITION 14. Managers' personal ambivalence
about ongoing change efforts often leads to misalignments between words and deeds, and so affects BI.

Individual Processes: Self-Knowledge
Self-knowledge can be expected to affect the actual alignment between managers' words and deeds. A manager
can only represent her priorities and preferences accurately if she knows what they truly are. A lack of selfunderstandingcan easily lead to unintended inaccuracies
in self-portrayal, and to unanticipatedchanges and inconsistent behavior. Weick (1995) describes managers as
constantly attempting to figure out their personal and professional values from reflecting on their words and actions. Kouzes and Posner (1993, p. 60) describe the vulnerability of this phenomenon:
If leaders are not clear about what they believe in, they are much
more likely to change their positions with every fad or opinion
poll. Without core beliefs and with only shifting positions,
would-be leaders will be judged as inconsistent and will be derided for being "political" in their behavior. The first step on
the credibility journey is thus clarification of values.

Management education, then, represents a two-edged
sword: To the extent that it promotes efforts to implement
the latest management fad, it threatens word-deed alignment and so threatens behavioral integrity. To the extent
that it promotes introspection and clarification of the
manager's own values, it may enhance behavioral integrity.
PROPOSITION 15. Management development processes
that enhance personal value clarification will enhance the
alignment between managers' words and deeds, and thus
enhance BI.

Individual Processes: Manager Personality Traits
One can anticipate that personality attributesof individual
managers might affect their pattern of actual word-deed
alignment, and so affect BI. The personality trait of SelfMonitoring (Snyder 1974), for example, "... presumes
consistent patterns of individual differences in the extent
to which people regulate their self-presentation by tailoring their actions in accordance with immediate situational
cues" (Lennox and Wolfe 1984, p. 1349). People high on
the dimension of self-monitoring may be expected to display greater cross-situational variability in their conduct
and language (Lennox and Wolfe 1984), and this greater
variability increases the chance that an observer might
notice misalignments and as a result ascribe lower behavioral integrity. While cross-situational behavior variability is in many ways a desirable managerial attribute
because it facilitates boundary-spanning performance
(Caldwell and O'Reilly 1982), behavioral integrity theory
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCEVol. 13, No. 1, January-February 2002

would suggest a potential drawback to this attribute. If,
in fact, high self-monitors are described as demonstrating
low behavioral integrity, such a case would present an
interesting ambivalence regarding the desirability of selfmonitoring as a managerial attribute.
The "big five" personality dimension of Conscientiousness (Goldberg 1990) includes such descriptors as consistency, order, self-discipline, and reliability. It seems
reasonable to assert that this personality dimension would
be associated with high levels of word-action alignment-possibly because managers who are more conscientious will expend greater effort to follow through on
expressed commitments.
PROPOSITION 16. Managers' personality traits of selfmonitoring and conscientiousness can be expected to affect behavioral consistency, and so to have negative and
positive associations, respectively, with BI.

An Accelerating Loop at the Action Level:
Managerial Dissociation
When a manager's own words and deeds are misaligned
with each other for a sustained period of time, mechanisms that resemble internal impression management and
the need to appear consistent (Fiske and Taylor 1991)
become active to divert managers' attention away from
these inconsistencies or potential hypocrisies. Thus, the
more a manager's deeds are misaligned with her words,
the less aware she becomes of this misalignment-and
hence, the more likely she is to enhance and perpetuate
it.
Shapiro (1995) describes an array of responses to official slogans and mission statements that are unsupported
by actual reward systems in the organization. Some employees will become increasingly frustrated as they attempt to bridge the large gap between the espoused and
the actual. Others will become cynical and contemptuous
of their leaders. The majority, however, will learn to compartmentalize or dissociate the "speaking" and the "action" parts of their work. It is true that, in many organizations, the manager's path to success seems to lie in
verbal endorsements of espoused values, coupled with
actual behavior that is in line with more widely accepted
implicit norms and standards, and that the two elements
often do not match. Many managers respond to this kind
of environment by accepting it, and by minimizing their
awareness and examination of any incongruity between
their words and deeds. Argyris (1990, p. 62) notes that
managers in an environment where espoused values do
not match with actions will talk the espoused while behaviorally following the enacted, and will defensively
tend to resist self-examination. Brunsson (1989, p. 227)
31

<-----Page 15----->TONY SIMONS

Behavioral Integrity

adds that managers who have low tolerance for hypocrisy,
or little "schizophrenic capacity for keeping disparate
roles apart" are likely to become depressed in such an
environment. In organizations with substantial decoupling between espousal and action, this form of dissociative compartmentalizationmay be an individually adaptive response.
Social cognition research offers a few models to explain this pattern of behavior. Swann and Read (1981)
note that people have preferentialrecall for behaviors that
are consistent with their self-image. To the extent that few
people like to think of themselves as speaking one way
and acting another, they are unlikely to retrieve evidence
that this is the case. Carver's (1979) cyberetic theory of
self-regulation notes that self-awareness of behavior that
does not match one's own standards, when changing the
behavior might entail negative consequences such as unemployment, can lead a person to "disengage mentally,"
and hence, to stop paying attention to the discrepancy or
misalignment. If one knows one is behaving badly, but
believes that the wrongdoing is necessary, one tends to
tune out awareness of the whole mess. Self-awareness
theory (Carver and Scheier 1981) posits that this disengagement results from aversion to the awareness of one's
inadequacy. Fiske and Taylor (1991) summarize extensive research that supports this model of attentional processes in response to evidence of less-than-ideal behavior.
This consideration leads to the following propositions:
PROPOSITION 17. Managers will often be unaware of
misalignments between their own words and deeds.
PROPOSITION 17A. Misalignments

between a man-

ager's words and deeds regarding a given issue will, over
time, desensitize the manager to further misalignments
regarding that issue.

Discussion and Summary

This paper proposes that behavioral integrity is a construct that warrants further study. BI is a key antecedent
to trust that describes responses to a wider range of organizational experiences than the psychological contract,
but is both conceptually and practically simpler than trust.
We assert that BI is highly problematic in today's managerial environment of rapid competitive, technological,
and organizational change, that it has profound consequences for employee retention and performance, and that
it has been the subject of little direct empirical research.
As organizations increasingly address diverse constituencies, as they adapt to increasingly turbulent business
environments, and as management fads appear and disappear at ever-increasing speeds, the issue of BI is likely
to increase in practical importance.

Behavioral integrity is a fundamentally subjective construct that entails internal attributionsfor managers' patterns of word-deed alignment and misalignment. It can
be applied to referents at various levels of abstraction,
from individual managers, to a generalized notion of the
management of a given organization, and perhaps even
authority figures in general. The ascription of BI entails
a relatively complex perception and interpretationprocess
that is based on an objective reality, but can be biased by
a number of factors. Managers' actual word-deed alignment, which serves as a basis for employees' BI ascriptions, appears to be challenged by managerial fashions
and organizational change efforts, individually and in series. These last factors appear to have stimulated the
emergence of behavioral integrity as a widespread problem. It should be noted that the sequential model proposed in this paper contains two accelerating loops-one
at the stage of actual word-deed alignment, and one at the
stage of perception. The presence of these two accelerating loops makes it likely that small word-deed misalignments can have substantial consequences.
The proposal of behavioral integrity as an important
construct for empirical research and prescription gives
rise to several questions for furtherexploration. If behavioral integrity ascriptions emerge from assessments of
alignment between words and deeds, what happens to assessments of the alignment among different actions? Because managerial actions are often accorded symbolic
weight, those assessments might or might not be similar
to BI. A second question regards the possible multidimensionality of BI: Do employees form a unitaryjudgment of a manager's BI, or can a manager be seen as
having high BI with regard to some values, but not with
regard to others? Perhaps this dimensionality varies with
the observer's cognitive complexity or engagement. A
third question involves the direction of misalignment: If
most word-deed misalignment tends to occur in the direction of overpromising and claiming socially desirable
managerial values, what of the converse situation? In efforts to manage employee perceptions of managers'
word-deed alignment, it is critical to know what, if any,
is the cost of underpromising. Fourth, there remains a
question of whether behavioral integrity assessments shift
gradually, or, as Robinson's (1996) work suggests, show
a threshold effect. Finally, ethnic culture very likely influences the perception of and response to managers'
word-deed misalignment. This influence warrantsexploration and articulation.
The BI framework must not be interpretedto mean that
organizations should not experiment with change efforts,
that new developments in management science should not
receive attention, or that diverse stakeholder desires

Behavioral Integrity

should be ignored. Rather, it points to trade-offs that must
be made intelligently for organizational success, and to a
need for techniques that attenuate the costs of the above
practices. Practitioners have, since the early days of organizational development writing, stressed the importance of executives' "walking their talk" (McGregor
1967). The behavioral integrity perspective adds to this
imperative a reminder of the importance of accurate selfrepresentation. To import a phrase from Weick (1995),
managers should consider the virtues of "talking their
walk."

Endnotes
'Almost identical typologies are described in the other two reviews
cited. For simplicity of presentation, Bies' (1987) formulation is offered as a useful exemplar.
2This kind of perceptual readiness is in many ways similar to Wanous'
(1994) concept of organizational cynicism. Wanous defines organizational cynicism as a belief in the futility of organizational change and
the ascription of negative attributes to those responsible for making
that change. He argues that cynicism is a learned response, that it serves
as a perceptual screen for ambiguous events, and that some individuals
will be personally predisposed toward cynicism. In all three of these
qualities, organizational cynicism resembles the negative activation,
and subsequent accessibility, of the BI construct. BI is both more variable and more specific in terms of its referent. Wanous' construct entails a global belief set about the organization and its managers, while
BI can be applied to a single person or an organization, and may arise
in response to several different organizational situations.
3Sitkin and Stickel interpret their findings in light of staff perception
that they had value incongruence with management. It seems likely,
though, that management had at one time espoused values that were
congruent with those of the staff, and that the enactment of different
values triggered disaffection through ascriptions of low behavioral integrity. The adequacy of the behavioral integrity framework, as opposed to the value incongruence framework, for explaining this phenomenon is an empirical question.
