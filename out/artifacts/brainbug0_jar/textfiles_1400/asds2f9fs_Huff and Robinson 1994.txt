esearch has established that for surviving brands, market pioneers have a higher average
market share than later entrants. By moving first, market pioneers often develop sustainable
market share advantages. Longer leadtime, which is the time between entries, should increase
these pioneer advantages. Using two leadtime measures, this prediction is supported across 34
categories of frequently purchased consumer goods. Increasing the years of competitive rivalry
should help a later entrant slowly reduce the pioneer's market share advantage. After more
than two decades in the market, second entrants have eliminated the pioneer's market share
advantage, but third and later entrants continue to trail the pioneer.

1. Introduction
Why are so many companies today trying to enter markets faster? Griffin (1993) describes a number of factors
that include shorter product life cycles, faster product
obsolescence, and intensified competition. In addition,
numerous empirical studies report that long-term benefits are often captured by the first-mover. For example,
see Kerin et al. (1992) and Robinson et al. (1994). A
first-mover advantage arises when the market pioneer
develops a sustainable competitive advantage versus
later entrants.
When first-mover advantages arise, increasing leadtime, or the time between entries, should enhance these
advantages. For example, increasing leadtime should
help the pioneer establish an even stronger brand name
(Schmalensee 1982) and move customers' ideal points
closer to the pioneer's attribute mix (Carpenter and
Nakamoto 1989). Increasing leadtime should also help
the pioneer further broaden its product line (Robinson
and Fornell 1985).
Research supports the importance of leadtime. Across
a broad sample of United States manufacturing businesses, executives report leadtime is the second most

important means of protecting competitive advantages
for new or improved products (Levin et al. 1987), trailing only sales and service. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, only one empirical study directly links
leadtime to pioneer market share advantages. Hurwitz
and Caves (1988) examine 56 drugs after patent expiration. In the pharmaceutical industry, they report "another year of effective patent life is worth roughly 1.6
percentage points of market share" (p. 314).
Our study builds on the award-winning research of
Urban et al. (1986) on first-mover advantages, utilizing
their data covering 95 surviving brands in 34 categories
of frequently purchased consumer goods. The dependent variable is a later entrant's market share relative
to the pioneer's share (relative market share). While
Urban et al. examine leadtime, their lag between entry
measure does not have the expected sign and is not
statistically significant.
Our study also builds on Brown and Lattin (1994)
by decomposing their relative time in the market measure into two components. Using a two-stage conceptual
model, relative time in the market (or the later entrant's
time in the market divided by the pioneer's time in the

market) is determined by pioneer leadtime and years
of competitive rivalry. While relative time in the market
is more parsimonious, decomposing it into pioneer
leadtime and years of competitive rivalry permits an
estimation of two conceptually different forces. It also
permits a comparison of two leadtime measures and an
examination of leadtime's increasing importance in
markets started from 1960 to 1974 versus those started
earlier.
To estimate the impact of leadtime on a later entrant's
relative market share, Urban et al.'s lag between entry
measure is compared to pioneer leadtime. Empirically,
both measures consistently indicate that increasing
leadtime decreases relative market share. In this sense,
the impact of leadtime on relative market share is robust.
Competitive rivalry occurs when the market pioneer
and later entrant are both in the market. Increasing the
years of competitive rivalry should help offset the pioneer's order of entry and leadtime advantages, since
pioneer market share advantages slowly deteriorate over
time (Robinson and Fornell 1985, Robinson 1988).
While this empirical result is both strong and robust,
only second entrants in markets started prior to 1957
markets tend to catch the pioneer. Market shares for
third and later entrants though continue to be penalized.
In addition to estimating the market share impact of
leadtime and years of competitive rivalry, we test
whether pioneer market share advantages have
strengthened over time. Pioneers in markets started
from 1960 to 1974 could launch their brands with the
aid of national television advertising. Pioneers in markets started prior to 1957 launched their brands with
either limited or no television advertising. Holding the
number of leadtime years constant, pioneers in the relatively young markets developed greater market share
advantages. Shorter leadtimes though offset most if not
all of these greater market share advantages.

2. Two-stage Conceptual Model
and Hypotheses
The two-stage conceptual model follows the standard
approach used to theoretically model first-mover advantages. In the first stage, the first-mover (market pioneer) has a temporary monopoly. Strategic behavior
yields a sustainable advantage over a later entrant who
arrives in the second stage. Thus, a first-mover advan-

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOL40, No. 10, October 1994

tage is developed when the market pioneer is in the
market and the later entrant is out of the market.
Schmalensee (1982) uses this approach to show that
even with physically identical products, the risk of an
unfavorable consumption experience motivates rational
consumers to continue buying the known pioneering
brand. In this model, the pioneer begins with a temporary monopoly. Consumers try the pioneering brand
and conclude that it works (Stage 1). Even after a later
entrant arrives with a physically identical product, riskaverse consumers prefer the pioneering brand (Stage
2). This is because they know the pioneering brand
works, but are uncertain about the later entrant's brand.
Thus, simply knowing the pioneering brand works
yields a first-mover advantage.
We call the stage where the pioneer is in the market
and the later entrant is out of the market the window
of opportunity. The stage where the pioneer is facing a
later entrant is called competitive rivalry.
Stage 1: Window of Opportunity
Assuming that first-mover advantages are developed
when the market pioneer is in the market and the later
entrant is out of the market, two key variables influence
first-mover advantages versus a later entrant. The first
variable measures order of market entry. When the first
entrant has an advantage over the second, it should
have an even greater advantage over the third. This is
because fewer opportunities remain for the third entrant. Empirical studies support this inverse relationship
between order of market entry and market share (see
Kerin et al. 1992, Kalyanaram and Urban 1992, and
Robinson et al. 1994).
The second variable measures leadtime, or the length
of time the first-mover has a temporary monopoly versus a later entrant. This temporary monopoly gives the
pioneer the opportunity to develop sustainable market
share advantages. Increasing leadtime should help establish brand reliability (Schmalensee 1982), shape
customer preferences towards familiar brands (Carpenter and Nakamoto 1989), and preempt later entrants
with key product line extensions (Robinson and Fornell
1985, Robinson 1988). Thus, the total pioneer advantage versus a given later entrant should be determined
by both order of entry and leadtime.
While this approach measures leadtime as the length

1371

<-----Page 3----->HUFF AND ROBINSON
Note

of time the pioneer has a temporary monopoly versus
a later entrant, Urban et al. (1986) measure leadtime
relative to the previous entrant. Because additional delay
can decrease the n th entrant's market share and increase
the first entrant's market share, increasing the lag between entry should decrease relative market share.
To illustrate the difference in approaches, consider a
product category in which the first entrant introduced
its brand in 1950, the second in 1957, and the third in
1960. Pioneer leadtimes are 7 years versus the second
entrant and 10 years versus the third entrant. In contrast,
the lag between entry values are 7 years and 3 years.
Recall the dependent variable in the Urban et al.
model is the later entrant's market share relative to the
pioneer's share. While lag between entry includes information on the entry timing of the n - 1 entrant brand,
it only measures a portion of the window of opportunity.
Pioneer leadtime though measures the window of opportunity's entire length. In this sense, pioneer leadtime
provides more information than lag between entry.
While pioneer leadtime has an important conceptual
advantage in terms of measuring the window of opportunity's entire length, lag between entry has an important empirical advantage. This is because lag between entry has less multicollinearity with order of entry
than pioneer leadtime. Because pioneer leadtime has a
conceptual advantage but lag between entry has an empirical advantage, the data analysis compares their relative importance. Using either pioneer leadtime or lag
between entry, we have:

Dynamic Changes in the Window of Opportunity
Has the impact of order of entry and leadtime remained
constant, or has it increased over time? This issue is
important because the data cover markets that started
from 1876 to 1974. Pioneers in younger markets have
had access to marketing tools largely unavailable to pioneers in earlier time periods. Probably the most important change for frequently purchased consumer
goods has been national television advertising. For example, Myers et al. (1980, Ch. 2) conclude that between
1952 and 1977, the two biggest changes to influence
marketing management were computers and television.
Market pioneers who had access to national television

1372

advertising during their window of opportunity could
more rapidly generate brand name awareness and thus
develop greater market share advantages than pioneers
with no or only limited television advertising. To test
this dynamic change, the data are split into two groups:
markets pioneered from 1876 to 1956 and those pioneered from 1960 to 1974. These groupings are based
on three key reasons.
First, they correspond roughly to the national introduction of television advertising. Television emerged as
a mass medium in 1948, increased to 34% household
penetration in 1952, 56% in 1954, and 72% in 1956
(Saliba 1972). By 1960, 87% of United States households had a television set. Thus, during their window
of opportunity, the majority of market pioneers in the
older markets received little or no benefit from television
advertising. Pioneers in the younger markets though all
had the opportunity to benefit from television advertising.
Second, the data represent an approximate median
split with 18 product categories started in 1956 or earlier
and 16 product categories started from 1960 to 1974.
Given the modest sample size of 95 observations, an
approximate median split yields an adequate sample
size for each group in the data analysis. Third, no product categories started in 1957, 1958, or 1959. This natural gap determined the exact split in the data.
Given more powerful marketing tools, a market pioneer should have been able to accomplish more with
a given window of opportunity in the younger markets.

Stage 2: Competitive Rivalry
Once a later entrant enters the market, the pioneer's
window of opportunity ends and the second stage,
competitive rivalry, begins. The competitive rivalry stage
is measured by the number of years the pioneer and
the later entrant have both been in the market.1Because
' Brown and Lattin's (1994) relative time in the market measure equals
the later entrant's time in the market divided by the first entrant's

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/VOl. 40, No. 10, October 1994

<-----Page 4----->HUFF AND ROBINSON
Note

the Urban et al. market share data were gathered in
roughly 1983, years of competitive rivalry are measured
by the difference between 1983 and the later entrant's
entry year. For example, a follower that entered in 1960
faced 23 years of competitive rivalry with the first entrant.
Increasing the years of competitive rivalry should increase the later entrant's relative market share. This is
consistent with Scherer and Ross (1990, ch. 10) who
conclude that dominant firm market share levels gradually decline over time. This is because it is usually more
profitable to gradually sell off market share than to hold
on to each and every customer. It is also consistent with
Robinson and Fornell (1985) and Robinson (1988) who
report that pioneer share advantages in mature markets
gradually decline over time. The decline is gradual in
the sense that pioneers maintain market share advantages over later entrants. This yields.2
H4. Increasing the years of competitive rivalry increases a later entrant's relative marketshare.

Data and Descriptive Statistics

Our analysis utilizes the Urban et al. (1986) data covering 95 observations in 34 product categories of frequently purchased consumer goods. Each observation
is a surviving brand. Product category examples include
chewing gum, freeze-dried coffee, fabric softener, and
furniture polish. Because of minor data input and product category changes in the data available to us, our
replicated results are not identical to Urban et al. They
are essentially equivalent though in terms of estimated
signs, coefficient magnitudes, and statistical significance.

time in the market. By definition, the later entrant's time in the market
equals years of competitive rivalry and the first entrant's time in the
market equals pioneer leadtime plus years of competitive rivalry. From
this perspective, we are decomposing relative time in the market into
pioneer leadtime and years of competitive rivalry.
Note we did not include a competitive rivalry interaction term for
markets started from 1960 to 1974. Unlike the pioneer advantage
gained during the window of opportunity, both competitors are in
the market. Thus, because the pioneer has the same options to combat
the follower as the follower has to catch the pioneer, these options
should be largely offsetting. Empirically, this interaction term is not
statistically significant.

For example, the unstandardized ordinary least squares
(OLS) coefficient estimates reported in Urban et al. are
-0.49 for order of entry, 0.07 for lag between entry,
1.11 for positioning quality, and 0.28 for advertising.
This compares to our unstandardized estimates of
-0.44, 0.05, 1.12, and 0.28.

4. Model Specification and
Estimation
Because the Urban et al. model provides a strong goodness of fit (R2 = 0.76), predicts 73% of the turning
points in the hold out sample, and provides no evidence
of either heteroskedasticity or outliers, our data analysis
builds on their multiplicative model specification. To
assure that the share index equals one for the first entrant, the Urban et al. model does not include an intercept term. For brand n in category c:

In the empirical results, Urban et al. and other studies

for markets started from 1960 to 1974. If a4 < 0, dynamic changes in the leadtime impact (H3) are supported for markets started from 1960 to 1974. If a5

5. Results
Table 1 provides the results. Because of multicollinearity,
both leadtime measures cannot be included in the same
equation (The simple Pearson correlation between lag
between entry and pioneer leadtime equals 0.48.). Thus,
half of the model specifications include lag between entry and half include pioneer leadtime. While it would
be ideal to include both measures in a single equation,
examining two leadtime measures provides insights into
the robustness of the results. Since each hypothesis has

Note

a specific sign prediction, the statistical significance tests
are one-tailed.
Table l's first specification (Si) replicates the Urban
et al. model with standardized variables. Similar to Urban et al., the estimated positive sign for lag between
entry differs from the predicted negative sign. In the
second specification (S2), pioneer leadtime replaces lag
between entry.5 Again, the estimated sign is positive
while the predicted sign is negative.
It is important to note that the empirical results below
indicate that the positive signs for the two leadtime
measures are based on models that are not fully specified. With more complete model specifications (Specifications 3 to 6 below), the estimated coefficients consistently switch to the expected negative sign.
Specifications 3 through 6 include years of competitive rivalry. Specifications 3 and 4 add the 1960 to 1974
order of entry interaction term (H2). Because of multicollinearity, this interaction term can not be included
in the same model as the 1960 to 1974 leadtime interaction term (H3). Thus, Specifications 5 and 6 replace
the 1960 to 1974 order of entry interaction term with
the 1960 to 1974 leadtime interaction term. Because
Specifications 3 to 6 provide the most complete model
specifications, they are used to test the hypotheses.
Does increasing pioneer leadtime decrease a later entrant's relative market share (Hi)? Specification 4 estimates the pioneer leadtime impact across the entire
sample. Pioneer leadtime has the expected negative sign
and is statistically significant. Specification 6 estimates
the pioneer leadtime impact over two different time periods. For markets started before 1957, the pioneer
leadtime coefficient estimate has the expected sign, but
is only significant at the 15% level. For markets started
from 1960 to 1974, the total impact equals the sum of
the leadtime estimate plus the interaction term estimate.
The sum of -0.36 is statistically significant (t = -2.01).
In Specifications 3 and 5, similar results arise for lag
between entry. In total, all six of the leadtime estimates
have the expected sign and five are statistically signif-

that the t-statistic for pioneer leadtime equals 1.58. It is not
statistically significant because, with a one-tail test, the expected sign
is negative and the estimated sign is positive. If a two-tailed test is
used to account for the surprising sign, pioneer leadtime still falls
short of 1.66, which is the critical value for 10% significance.

icant at the 5% level or better. These robust results indicate that increasing leadtime tends to decrease a later
entrant's relative market share.
While pioneer leadtime has more conceptual support
than lag between entry, why are the empirical results
roughly equivalent? This seems to arise because the
conceptual support for pioneer leadtime is roughly offset
by greater multicollinearity with order of market entry.
(The simple Pearson correlation between pioneer leadtime and order of entry equals 0.59 versus -0.25 for
lag between entry.)
Has the order of entry penalty increased over time
(H2)? In Specifications 3 and 4, both interaction coefficients have the expected negative sign and are statistically significant. Has the leadtime penalty increased
over time (H3)? In Specifications 5 and 6, both leadtime
interaction terms have the predicted negative sign and
are statistically significant. The combined results for H2
and H3 indicate that a given window of opportunity
provides a greater advantage for pioneers in markets
that started from 1960 to 1974. The model though cannot determine the degree to which the difference is
based on order of entry versus leadtime.
While a given window of opportunity provides a
greater advantage for more recent pioneers, older market
pioneers enjoyed longer windows of opportunity.6
These two forces tend to cancel each other out as the
average predicted market share for later entrants (holding everything but order of entry and leadtime constant)
is nearly the same in the older markets as in the more
recent markets. For example, applying the estimated
coefficient estimates to average leadtimes in the older
and newer markets, the predicted relative market share
for a second entrant is 0.52 in the older markets versus
0.50 in the younger markets. Thus, shorter leadtimes
offset most, if not all of the greater market share advantages.
Does an increase in the number of years of competitive rivalry increase a later entrant's relative market
share (H4)? Across all four specifications, the competitive rivalry impact is consistently positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. With standardized

Gort and Klepper (1982) report similar results.

1375

<-----Page 7----->HUFF AND ROBINSON
Note

coefficients that are 0.35 or higher, this result is both
strong and robust.
Given the important impact of years of competitive
rivalry, have later entrants in the older markets caught
or even surpassed the market pioneer? Relative market
share is forecast using average values for leadtime and
years of competitive rivalry. The average is calculated
for second, third, and fourth entrants. Advertising and
positioning are both held constant, i.e., Al,Cand P1,Cboth
equal 1.0. The forecasting results average across Specifications 3 through 6.
In markets started prior to 1957, second entrants have
caught but not surpassed the pioneer. Relative market
share averages 21 % below the pioneer for third entrants
and 34% below for fourth entrants. In markets started
from 1960 to 1974, second entrants remain penalized
at roughly 20% below the pioneer's share. Thus, pioneer
share advantages have only been eliminated by second
entrants in markets started prior to 1957. Other entrants
continue to trail the pioneer's market share by 20% or
more.

6. Summary and Conclusions
When a firm attempts to pioneer a new market, the
associated short-term costs and risks are often high
and certain to occur. The long-term benefits, however,
are very uncertain because market pioneers can selfdestruct, be crushed by an established giant in a related
market, or be worn down by an onslaught of later entrants. In the face of such risks, pioneers must understand how their innovation and risk-taking will be rewarded.
Increasing leadtime tends to increase the pioneer's
market share reward. This result is robust in the sense
that it is supported by two leadtime measures, i.e., lag
between entry and pioneer leadtime. It is also supported
across markets that started prior to 1957 and in markets
started from 1960 to 1974. (The only exception is that
in markets started prior to 1-957, the pioneer leadtime
results are statistically significant at the 15% level.)
On the other hand, increasing the number of years
of competitive rivalry helps later entrants slowly chip
away at the pioneer's market share. In markets started
prior to 1957, the model results predict that second entrants have actually caught the pioneer. Third and later

1376

entrants continue to face market share penalties of
roughly 20% or more. In markets pioneered from 1960
to 1974, even second entrants face a 20% market share
penalty. These results indicate that the pioneer's market
share decline is gradual.
Measurement Recommendations Depend on the
Sample Size
The empirical results above compare pioneer leadtime
to lag between entry. Years of competitive rivalry is also
examined. In addition, Brown and Lattin (1994) propose
using relative time in the market. Given these numerous
measures, what measure or combinations of measures
should be used in future research? While exact guidelines cannot be provided, the measurement choice
should depend on the sample size.
In a relatively large sample, the authors recommend
using pioneer leadtime along with years of competitive
rivalry. Pioneer leadtime has a conceptual advantage in
terms of measuring the window of opportunity's entire
length. The empirical disadvantage of having more
multicollinearity than lag between entry should decline
as the sample size increases. This is because more observations help offset multicollinearity's damaging impact (Theil 1971, p. 166). Because of its solid conceptual
and empirical support, years of competitive rivalry
should also be included.
With a modest sample size, such as the Urban et al.
data, either pioneer leadtime or lag between entry can
be used along with years of competitive rivalry. The
results above indicate that pioneer leadtime's conceptual
advantage appears to be roughly offset by the empirical
disadvantage of having a higher degree of multicollinearity. Again, years of competitive rivalry should be
included in the model.
With a small sample size that cannot support having
both a leadtime measure and years of competitive rivalry
in the model, Brown and Lattin's (1994) relative time
in the market measure is recommended. Because relative
time in the market is determined by pioneer leadtime
and years of competitive rivalry, their parsimonious
measure combines two important forces.
Conclusion
During their window of opportunity, both order of
market entry and leadtime have an important impact

Note

on a pioneer's sustainable market share advantage. Of
course, a market pioneer should realize that a later entrant's superior positioning quality and heavy advertising, coupled with the mere passage of time, can yield
the highest market share. This scenario though is the
exception. The greatest market share awards typically
arise for innovative firms who are both first to market
and have a long leadtime over later entrants.7
