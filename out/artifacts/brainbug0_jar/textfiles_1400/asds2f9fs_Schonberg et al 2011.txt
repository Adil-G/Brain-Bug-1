Economists define risk in terms of the variability of
possible outcomes, whereas clinicians and laypeople
generally view risk as exposure to possible loss or harm.
Neuroeconomic studies using relatively simple behavioral tasks have identified a network of brain regions that
respond to economic risk, but these studies have had
limited success predicting naturalistic risk-taking. By
contrast, more complex behavioral tasks developed by
clinicians (e.g. Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Iowa
Gambling Task) correlate with naturalistic risk-taking
but resist decomposition into distinct cognitive constructs. We propose here that to bridge this gap and
better understand neural substrates of naturalistic risktaking, new tasks are needed that: are decomposable
into basic cognitive and/or economic constructs; predict
naturalistic risk-taking; and engender dynamic, affective
engagement.
Defining risk
When economists and clinical psychologists characterize
behavior as ‘risky’, they use the same word but mean
different things. Risk in the economics and finance literatures (e.g. [1]) is usually defined in terms of the variance of
possible monetary outcomes, and risk seeking is defined as
a preference for a higher variance payoff, holding expected
value (EV) constant. By contrast, when clinicians and lay
people identify behaviors as risky (e.g. drug use, unprotected-sex, or mountain climbing) they invoke a broader
meaning of the term. Clinicians typically define risky
behavior as behavior that can harm oneself or others [2].
Interviews with experienced managers suggest that they
also tend to see risk in terms of possible negative outcomes,
rather than conceiving it in terms of chance probabilities or
some quantifiable construct [3]. Psychometric studies have
found that the lay conception of riskiness encompasses a
‘dread’ dimension that is characterized by lack of control
and/or potential catastrophic consequences, and an ‘unknown’ dimension that is characterized by unobservable,
unfamiliar, and/or delayed consequences [4].
This gap in definitions is reflected in distinct approaches
to studying risk. Neuroeconomics is a field aimed at underCorresponding author: Poldrack, R.A. (poldrack@mail.utexas.edu).

standing the neural basis of decision-making by drawing on
models from behavioral economics and methods used in
cognitive neuroscience [5]. The bulk of the neuroeconomics
literature has focused (with substantial success) on disentangling the role of specific brain regions in coding economic
variables implicated in traditional expectation-based models of risk-taking (Box 1), or mean–variance models of risktaking used in financial decision theories (Box 2). However,
economic paradigms have had limited success in predicting
individual differences in naturalistic risk-taking, even in the
monetary domain. Meanwhile, clinical psychologists and
clinical neuroscientists have advanced behavioral paradigms that better predict real-world risk-taking behaviors
and resonate more closely with the lay conception of risk.
However, they cannot readily be decomposed to identify
separate underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in naturalistic risk-taking. In this review, we propose
a research approach that combines the conceptual rigor of
neuroeconomics with the predictive validity of clinical neuroscience, thus bridging these disciplines. We believe that
such an approach will yield a better understanding of the
neural mechanisms involved in risky decision making in
both healthy and clinical populations.
Neuroeconomics of risk perception and risk-taking
Since Knight [6], economists have distinguished decision
under risk, in which the decision maker knows the objective probability distribution over possible outcomes, from
decision under uncertainty, in which this information is
assessed with some degree of vagueness (Box 3).
Early neuroimaging studies of risk relied largely on task
paradigms (Tables 1 and 2) that manipulate variance in the
probability distribution of reward, enabling the identification of neural responses associated with objective risk defined in economic terms. This work has identified riskrelated responses in several regions, mainly the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC), lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
and insula, all of which are also responsive to monetary
gains and/or losses. The lateral OFC and ACC were implicated in a positron emission tomography (PET) study coding
risk in terms of increased variance owing to differences in
probabilities of points lost or gained [7]. These regions, as
well as the insula, also responded to different levels of risk in

Box 1. Expectation-based models of risk-taking
Expectation-based models posit that preferences are a function of the
magnitudes and probabilities of possible outcomes. Consider a
prospect (x, p) that offers $x with probability p (and nothing
otherwise). A basic decision rule is to choose the outcome that
maximizes expected value (EV; Equation I):
EV ¼ p x:
[I]
EV maximization implies risk neutrality (e.g. indifference between
receiving: (i) $50 for sure, or (ii) a 50% chance to win $100). To
accommodate risk aversion, expected utility theory [66] allows the
subjective value of money to decrease as wealth increases. This gives
rise to a concave utility function, u(.) over states of wealth, W.
Decision makers choose the option that maximizes expected utility
(EU; Equation II):
EU ¼ p uðxÞ;

[II]

where u(x) represents the utility of outcome x. For example, a concave
utility function [u00 (x) < 0] implies that gaining $50 (in addition to one’s
current state of wealth) adds more than half the utility of gaining $100
(Figure Ia). Therefore, such a utility function implies that a sure $50 is
preferred to a 50% chance of $100.
A utility function over states of wealth cannot readily accommodate
pronounced risk aversion for gambles involving possible losses [67];
neither can it accommodate the commonly observed fourfold pattern
of risk preferences: risk aversion for high-probability gains and lowprobability losses, coupled with risk seeking for low-probability gains
and high-probability losses. Prospect theory [68,69] accommodates
these patterns by proposing that decision makers maximize the value
V of a prospect (Equation III):
V ðx; pÞ ¼ w ð pÞ vðxÞ;

[III]

[()TD$FIG]

where v(x) measures the subjective value of the consequence x, and
w( p) measures the impact of probability p on the attractiveness of the
prospect.

A typical value function v(.), displayed in Figure Ib, is characterized
by: (i) reference dependence: it is a function of changes in wealth
relative to a reference point, such as the status quo; (ii) diminishing
sensitivity: it is concave for gains but convex for losses; and (iii) loss
aversion: the loss limb is much steeper than the gain limb. Loss
aversion accommodates pronounced risk aversion for mixed (gain–
loss) gambles; for example, rejection of a gamble that offers a 50%
chance of winning $150 and a 50% chance of losing $100. Tom et al.
[70] and De Martino et al. [71] identified neural correlates of loss
aversion in humans. Diminishing sensitivity explains a general
tendency toward risk aversion for gains (as in expected utility theory)
but risk seeking for losses. Reference dependence allows risk
preferences to differ depending on whether prospects are described
(framed) in terms of gains or losses relative to different reference
points. De Martino et al. [72] studied framing susceptibility in humans
using fMRI.
The weighting function w(.), depicted in Figure Ic, captures
diminishing sensitivity to probabilities away from natural boundaries of impossibility ( p = 0) and certainty ( p = 1). The weighting
function is characterized by: (i) overweighting of probabilities near
zero; (ii) underweighting of probabilities otherwise, especially near
1; and (iii) reduced sensitivity to differences between intermediate
probabilities. Overweighting low-probability events can supersede
the impact of nonlinearities of the value function, leading to risk
seeking for low-probability gains (e.g. the attraction of lottery
tickets) and risk aversion for low-probability losses (e.g. the
attraction of insurance). Underweighting moderate to high probabilities reinforces the impact of nonlinearities of the value function,
leading to risk aversion for high-probability gains and risk seeking
for high-probability losses. The weighting function was recently
studied using fMRI by Hsu et al. [73], Paulus and Frank [74] and
Berns et al. [75].

to this function, the individual would rather receive $50 for sure than face a 50% chance of gaining $100 (and nothing otherwise). (b) A representative prospect theory

a gambling task, as measured using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) [8]. The posterior parietal cortex,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior insula
were found to be more active during a choice of risky versus
safe options [9]; in addition, fMRI activity levels in the right
insula following a negative outcome were negatively correlated with subsequent risky choices. Similarly, in a study
using a financial decision-making paradigm (involving uncertainty and learning), increased activity in anterior insula
was associated with subsequent switching by participants
from a risky to a safe option [10].

Preuschoff et al. [11] segregated risk (defined as variance
of possible outcomes) from expected reward in modeling a
similar paradigm to [8]. They found that risk was coded in
the ventral striatum, but on a more delayed timescale than
the phasic response to the reward prediction error signal
that is usually observed in this region. This fMRI signal
resembled sustained activity of dopamine neurons from
electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates
[12] (although see [13]), suggesting that dopamine neurons
encode both reward and its variance on different timescales.
The authors further used a model-driven approach to study

Box 2. Risk-value models of risk-taking
The risk-value approach to risk-taking, advanced in financial decision
theory [1], assumes that preferences are a function of two parameters:
risk, operationalized as the variance (or standard deviation) in the
probability distribution over possible outcomes, s; and expected
value, the mean of that distribution, m. Functions of these two
variables define indifference curves reflecting portfolios that a person
considers equally attractive (Figure I). A steeper indifference curve
represents greater risk aversion because it suggests that a given
increase in risk of a portfolio must be accompanied by a greater
increase in expected value to maintain its attractiveness.
The risk-value approach is appealing from a modeling standpoint
because it segregates an objective measure of riskiness from expected
reward. Unfortunately, behavioral studies show that perceived
riskiness is a function of more than merely variance. For instance,
holding variance constant, perceived riskiness can vary with: (i) the
absolute magnitude of payoffs; (ii) whether they are perceived as
gains or losses; and (iii) skewness of the probability distribution over
outcomes. An alternative approach that can accommodate such
behavioral tendencies includes a measure of perceived riskiness that
can diverge from objective measures (e.g. [76–78]).

the concepts of risk prediction and risk-prediction errors
[14], suggesting that both are encoded by the anterior insula,
again on different timescales.
In sum, neuroeconomic studies of risk have implicated
many of the same brain regions involved in the processing
of monetary gains and/or losses, putatively related to the
midbrain dopamine system and its targets, although potentially using different coding schemes and timescales
within those same systems.
Individual risk attitudes
A first step towards linking economic models to naturalistic risk-taking is to identify neural systems in which
activity is correlated with individual differences in economic risk attitudes. Recent work has shown that many
(but not all) of the brain areas that exhibit sensitivity to
economic risk (i.e. variance in the probability distribution
over possible outcomes) also reveal individual differences
that co-vary with risk preferences. Tobler et al. [15] found
positive associations between risk aversion and fMRI
signals coding variance of outcomes in lateral OFC, and
positive associations with risk-seeking in more medial
OFC regions. The same authors [16] also found an

EV-related fMRI signal in lateral OFC that was positively
correlated with risk aversion and negatively correlated
with risk-seeking. Another study found risk-seeking to be
negatively correlated with the fMRI signal in dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), whereas positive correlations
were found with reward magnitude signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) [17]. A fourth study
reported that the fMRI signal in inferior frontal gyrus
(IFG) increased during low-risk gambles and this increase
was positively correlated with individual risk aversion
[18]. Collectively, these studies suggest that individual
economic risk preferences modulate brain activity in the
regions implicated in risk processing: risk aversion was
correlated with lateral PFC regions in OFC, DMPFC and
IFG (adjacent to DLPFC), whereas risk seeking was positively correlated with activity in more medial prefrontal
cortex regions. Interestingly, the insula was not found to
code individual risk attitudes (for more on insula involvement in risk-taking, see [19]). The correlation of risk
attitudes with areas in inferior prefrontal cortex accords
with previous studies implicating this region in cognitive
control and inhibition (see [20]). The DLPFC, a region
previously implicated in self-control during decision making (e.g. [21]), has also been implicated in modulation of
risk attitudes. Knoch et al. [22] used repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to suppress activity in
the DLPFC, which led to increased risk-seeking in the
Cambridge Gambling Task [7]. Conversely, when excitability of the same regions was increased using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), subjects
exhibited increased risk aversion [23]. Thus, the DLPFC
might have a key role in the modulation of risk attitudes,
even though it has not been implicated in representation of
risk per se.
Despite this success in mapping neural building blocks
of economic risk-taking, such studies have seldom, if ever,
attempted to examine the association between individual
differences in neural response to economic risk and naturalistic risk-taking behavior. In fact, laboratory measures
of economic risk attitudes have rarely been used to predict
naturalistic risk-taking (or perhaps they have just rarely
succeeded). A few studies have had modest success predicting naturalistic financial risk-taking from laboratory
measures (e.g. hog farmers who were more risk averse for
lotteries were also more likely to hedge on the hog futures
market [24]). In other studies, researchers have predicted
naturalistic risk-taking behaviors from psychometric measures of risk tolerance (e.g. citizens who said they were
more risk tolerant were more likely to move from one part
of Germany to another [25]) or the association between
distinct real-world manifestations of risk-taking (e.g.
choice of labor contracts with different levels of income
risk could be predicted from other naturalistic behaviors,
such as expenditures on gambling and insurance [26]).
It bears mentioning that there might be inherent limits
to the proportion of variance in naturalistic risk-taking
behavior that can be explained using any measure of risk
preference. First, there is substantial variation in individual risk preferences across life domains, although these
probably reflect differences in perceived risks and/or benefits of such activities [27,28]. Second, several situational

Box 3. From risk to uncertainty
Most naturalistic decisions, other than simple games of chance, must
be made with incomplete knowledge of the probability distribution
over possible outcomes. Subjective expected utility theory (SEU) [79]
accommodates uncertainty by replacing objective probabilities with
subjective probabilities, inferred from choices, which are assumed to
accord with standard axioms of probability theory. However,
empirical studies of decision under uncertainty raise challenges to
this model that can be accommodated by an extension of prospect
theory from risk to uncertainty [69]. In particular:
 Subjective probabilities are not additive. If one asks a bettor how
much she is willing to pay to bet on each of several horses entered
in a race, her prices would typically sum to more than the total prize
paid for picking the winning horse. Under SEU with concave utility,
this implies subjective probabilities that sum to more than one. This
is because the tendency to overweight unlikely events and underweight probable events (captured by the inverse S-shaped weighting function under risk; Box 1), is amplified by similar bias in the
subjective assessment of probabilities [80–82].

variables can influence risk perception and risk preferences. These range from the way in which prospects are
framed (e.g. in terms of gains and losses [29]), depicted (e.g.
as a bar graph or density function [30]) or labeled (e.g.
Republicans reminded of their political affiliation were
subsequently more attracted to options labeled ‘conservative’ [31]) to the way in which preferences are elicited (e.g.
by pricing risky prospects versus choosing between them
[32,33]). Third, economic risk-preferences co-vary with
state variables, including specific emotions (e.g. people
are apparently more risk seeking when angry than when
fearful [34]) and motivational state (e.g. whether one is in
an aspirational or protective mode [35]).
Characterizing the components of naturalistic risktaking behavior
The neuroeconomic perspective on risk-taking has begun
to lay a foundation for understanding how the brain
responds to risky monetary payoffs, but the question
remains how to bridge the gap with risk-taking in situ.
To do so, one first needs to characterize risk-taking in
naturalistic environments. A popular inventory of such
behaviors, the domain-specific risk-attitude scale (DOSPERT; [28]) identifies five domains of risk-taking (recreational, financial, health, social and ethical) that differ
across individuals according to their self-reports. Such
behaviors (e.g. extreme sports, investing in stocks, smoking, taking the unpopular stand in a social discussion or
cheating in a tax return) all entail a potential negative
outcome and variance of possible outcomes. However, we
argue that willingness to accept variance in outcomes or
negative outcomes does not fully capture what drives
participation in such ‘risky’ behaviors.
In fact, several factors distinct from the economic conception of risk preference might contribute to what has
been called ‘risky’ behavior in the field. Consider, for
example, the choice to engage in unprotected sex. This
decision could stem from: (i) underestimating the likelihood of negative consequences; (ii) discounting possible
negative consequences because they are in the future;
or (iii) bowing to social pressure or perceived norms. Only
after one controls for such factors, and also related
14

 People generally find uncertainty aversive. Ellsberg [83] devised a
problem involving an urn with 50 red balls and 50 black balls, and an
urn with 100 red and black balls in unknown proportion. He asserted
that most people would rather bet that they would blindly draw a red
(black) ball from the urn with known probabilities than a red (black)
ball from the urn with unknown probabilities. This aversion to betting
on events with vague probabilities (‘ambiguity aversion’) has since
been validated and modeled in numerous studies (reviewed in [84]).
It appears to be driven by an aversion to betting in situations in which
one feels relatively ignorant or incompetent [85–87].
Neuroimaging studies of ambiguity aversion have aimed to identify
brain mechanisms that code risk and ambiguity. Hsu et al. [88] and
Levy et al. [89] conclude that the same regions code both, only to a
different degree. However, Huettel et al. [90] and Bach et al. [91]
conclude that distinct regions code risk and ambiguity. This
disagreement might be due to differences in empirical paradigms,
and further studies are needed.

constructs such as sensation-seeking and impulsivity,
can one distill what might be properly deemed individual
‘risk preference’ and identify economic factors contributing
to naturalistic risk-taking behavior.
Even if one is successful in mapping distilled measures
of naturalistic risk-taking onto economic variables, these
‘cold’ cognitive constructs still fail to capture fully what are
largely emotional decisions. In an influential survey, Loewenstein et al. [36] observed that risky decisions are driven
not just by anticipated emotions that a decision maker
associates with possible consequences, but also ‘anticipatory’ emotions experienced at the time of the decision.
Although these researchers emphasized negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety, we suggest that positive
emotions also have an important role in risk-taking behavior: for example, the exhilaration of waiting for a roulette
ball to land in its slot or driving a car beyond the speed
limit (see also [37] on ‘need for arousal’).
Decomposing current naturalistic risk-taking tasks
Well-designed neuroeconomic tasks have been relatively
decomposable (Table 2), but as discussed above, they often
lack external validity. Two prominent behavioral paradigms have had unique success predicting naturalistic
risk-taking behaviors. The first is the Iowa Gambling Task
(IGT), described in Table 1. The original study using this
task showed that patients with vmPFC lesions who exhibited ‘real-life’ risky behaviors were impaired on the task
[38] (for a recent fMRI study with healthy subjects showing
differences in this region, see [39]). Patients with lesions in
the amygdala, DLPFC, OFC or DMPFC, and other clinical
populations, such as drug abusers, alcoholics and pathological gamblers, were also found to be impaired on the IGT
(for a critical review, see [40]). Whereas the ‘bad’ decks are
indeed ‘riskier’ in an economic sense, increased variance in
this case is confounded with lower expected value. Moreover, risk preferences are confounded with the need to
learn the long-term EV of the decks (for critiques, see
[41,42]). Thus, it is almost impossible to determine the
degree to which individual differences in behavior in the
IGT reflect differences in learning, risk attitudes, and/or
sensitivity to gain and/or loss magnitude (however, a

Brief task description

[8]

[8]

Two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck containing cards numbered from
one to ten (one of each). After the first card is presented, participants bet whether the next
card will be higher or lower than the first card. Thus, there is maximal risk when the first
card is five or six, zero risk when it is ten or one.

[9]

[9]

On each trial, participants must respond quickly to receive a small sure gain of 20 points.
A longer wait involves potential higher gain or loss of either 40 points (longer wait) or 80
points (longest wait). All choices have the same expected value.

Behavioral
Investment
Allocation
Strategy
(BIAS) [10]

[10]

On each trial, participants choose between two stocks (gain/loss gambles, one stochastically
dominating the other) and one bond (a sure gain of $1). They must learn through trial-anderror the characteristics of the stocks, which change over blocks of trials. Feedback on payoffs
of the forgone options is presented on each trial.

[11]

[11,14]

Similar to [8] but participants bet on whether the second card will be higher or lower before
seeing the first card.

[15]

[15]

Each of 12 stimuli (circles of different colors, numbers and sizes) is associated with a different
reward magnitude and probability. These include all combinations of (100 and 200) point
rewards with (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) probabilities, plus 300 and 400 rewards with 0.5
probability. Participants are first trained to learn the probabilities and outcomes associated
with each stimulus. Next, on each trial, a stimulus appears in one of four quadrants of the
screen, and participants indicate which quadrant using a button press.

[16]

[18]

[18]

Experiment 1: on each trial, participants choose between a risky and safe option. The risky
option is a lottery that offers a 50–50 chance of different outcomes (£10, £90 or £40, £60)
and the safe option offers the participants’ own certainty equivalent for the corresponding
risky lottery, as determined in a previous phase of the experiment.
Experiment 2: as in Experiment 1, on each trial, participants choose between a risky and
safe option. This time, possible outcomes of the risky option include (£10, £50), (£15, £45),
(£40, £80) and (£30, £90), and the safe options offer a range of semi-random values.

[16]

The Cups
Task [95]

[17]

On each trial, participants choose between a risky and safe option. Each trial involves either
gains or losses. The options are presented as a choice of cups. The risky option involves
two to five cups, one containing a gain (loss) of $2, $3 or $5, and the others containing $0. If
the latter option is selected, the payoff from one cup is selected at random. The safe cup
offers a sure gain (loss) $1.

Iowa
Gambling
Task [38]

[38]

On each trial, participants select a card from one of four decks; two ‘bad’ decks offer a
higher reward on most trials but also higher possible loss and lower overall expected
value, whereas two ‘good’ decks offer a lower reward on most trials but lower possible
loss and higher expected value. Participants learn the nature of the decks through trial-anderror. In some versions of the task, the probabilities are not stationary.

[39]

Balloon
Analogue
Risk Task [44]

[44]

On each trial, participants pump a simulated balloon without knowing when it will explode.
Each pump increases the potential reward to be gained but also the probability of explosion,
which wipes out all potential gains for that trial. In most studies, balloon explosion probabilities
are drawn from a uniform distribution, and participants must learn explosion probabilities
through trial-and-error.

[52,53]

Devil’s
Task [55]

[54]

This task is a forerunner to the BART: on each trial, participants decide how many of seven
treasure chests to open. They are informed that six boxes contain a prize and one box
contains a ‘devil’ that will cause them to lose all their potential gains on that trial. Similar
to the BART, participants make sequential choices and, after opening each chest, decide
whether to continue to the next chest or cash in their earnings to that point.

Cambridge
Gambling
Task [7]

A token is hidden under one of six boxes that are each one of two colors. Different trials
have different ratios between box colors (3:3, 4:2, 5:1). On each trial, participants choose a
color on which to bet. The color with the higher probability (more boxes) is associated with
lower potential gains and lower potential losses of points than is the color with lower
probability.

computational model of distinct components of the task is
presented in [43]).
A second task that has successfully predicted naturalistic risk-taking is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (the
‘BART’) [44], described in Table 1. The average number of
pumps a person tolerates in the task was found to correlate
with self-reported drinking, smoking, stealing and substance use in healthy adults and adolescents [44–50],

Although tasks are often described as identifying a single cognitive or economic construct of interest, many tasks also engage additional potentially confounding processes.

risk (or expected value) is analyzed to identify the cognitive or economic constructs it also manipulated (listed in the top row of the table). Some of the studies listed in the table
accounted for these confounds using parametric statistical modeling.
b
+ indicates that the relevant construct (column) is engaged by that contrast (row).
c
? indicates unclear involvement of the relevant construct in the task.
d
In one condition the expected value is equal between the two options.

was provided in a study [53] that used bilateral tDCS
putatively to enhance excitability in DLPFC, resulting
in decreased risk-taking/pumping behavior in the BART.
Gianotti et al. [54] used the similar Devil’s task [55], which
requires no learning (Table 1). They reported that greater
risk-taking was positively correlated with lower tonic EEG
activity (delta and theta bands) in right-lateral prefrontal
cortex, consistent with a negative association between
lateral prefrontal cortex engagement and risk-taking.
Jentsch et al. developed a version of the BART for rodents
[56] and found that temporary inactivation of a region
homologous to the human DLPFC resulted in increased
variability in behavior and sub-optimal performance,
whereas inactivation of the OFC homolog resulted in
overall decreased risk-taking. Together, these results
suggest a convergence in the neural basis of risky choice
between neuroeconomic paradigms and more naturalistic
tasks: increased activity in the DLPFC (primarily in the
right hemisphere) underlies risk avoidance and self-control, whereas increased activity in the OFC underlies risktaking.
Although the BART is attractive owing to its predictive
validity, it does not lend itself well to decomposition. In
16

particular, a task analysis reveals that every pump
increases the probability of explosion and the variance of
possible outcomes, but (similar to the IGT) this increased
risk is confounded with varying expected value. Moreover,
because the probability distribution of explosions is unknown to subjects, this task also involves learning under
uncertainty (see [57] for a computational model of behavior
in the BART and [51] for comparison of models of BART
and IGT). A modified version of this task in which ‘explosion’ probabilities are transparent remains correlated with
self-reported naturalistic risk-taking [58], suggesting that
these associations do not necessarily reflect the learning
component, but decomposition of this task remains challenging.
Exhilaration and tension in naturalistic risk-taking
Despite the limitations of BART, it has appealing features.
First, as discussed above, it predicts self-reported measures of naturalistic risk-taking reasonably well and distinguishes clinical populations. Second, it uses a familiar
naturalistic metaphor that engenders a strong affective
response (a sense of escalating tension and exhilaration)
that mimics the affective phenomenological experience of

<-----Page 6----->Review
risk-taking in naturalistic environments, which could partially explain its capacity to predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors.
Another task that appears to tap directly into the affective
dimension of risk-taking is a variation of the ‘near-miss’
paradigm (see [59]) developed by Clark et al. [60]. The task
imitates a slot machine with two reels, each with six icons:
the icon on the first reel is fixed either by the participant or a
computer, and the second reel spins on each trial. Participants rated ‘near-miss’ losses in which the second reel
stopped one position away from a ‘match’ as more unpleasant
than ‘far-miss’ losses in which the second reel was farther
from matching. Interestingly, they also rated near misses as
more motivating for continued play than were far miss
losses. This was only the case for trials in which participants
had personal control by fixing the position of the first reel
themselves. Areas in both anterior insula and ventral striatum were found to be more active during near misses versus
full misses (although both reflect the same objective loss,
they entail varying degrees of subjective regret for one’s
choice, cf. [61]). Moreover, Chase and Clark [62] found that
among gamblers, fMRI activity in dopaminergic midbrain
regions during near-miss events correlated positively with
gambling severity. These results suggest that individual
differences in risk attitudes (at least in the case of gambling)
may be driven by individual differences in dopaminergic
response (see [63]), in this case to events coding loss but that
might simultaneously be experienced as exhilarating and
motivating for further action. It is worth noting that reward
prediction error signals in the striatum reach their peak
during adolescence [64], a time of heightened risk-taking,
consistent with a role for dopamine in risk-taking.
Bridging the gap
To bridge the gap between economic models and naturalistic risk-taking behaviors, we suggest that the former models must incorporate both the positive and negative
affective dimensions of risk-taking, through empirical paradigms that can capture them in more compelling ways. We
thus propose three criteria for such new laboratory paradigms:(i) Decomposable: the tasks must allow for decomposition and analysis in terms of cognitive and economic
primitives (e.g. magnitude of gains and losses, and probabilities), both for the sake of conceptual clarity and as a
prerequisite for identifying neural mechanisms using functional imaging and other tools of behavioral neuroscience.(ii) Externally valid: the tasks must exhibit empirical
associations with naturalistic risk-taking behaviors in
healthy or clinical populations and/or enable one to distinguish between them. Naturally, a requirement for validity
is reliability of such measures (on reliability of fMRI, see
[65]).(iii) Emotionally engaging: the tasks must not only
capture static and cognitive dimensions of risk-taking (e.g.
an evaluation of the probability distribution over possible
outcomes), but also engage dynamic and affective dimensions (e.g. the hope, exhilaration, tension, and/or fear that
might accompany risky behaviors).
From our reading, no single task yet conforms to all
three criteria. We argue that new tasks that do conform
will offer greater promise in helping identify behavioral
and neural factors that predict naturalistic risk-taking.

Box 4. Questions for future research
 How to do neural representations of risk differ between static or
description-based tasks and dynamic or experience-based tasks
[92]?
 What are the neural correlates of alternative, non-compensatory
strategies for risky choice, such as choosing the option that
minimizes overall probability of losing (for an early attempt, see
[93])?
 To what extent do neural representations of risk differ across
different domains of real-world naturalistic risk-taking, and to
what extent is there a ‘common pathway’ or set of regions for risk
processing in the brain?
 To what degree are representations of risk coded by patterns of
activity across relevant regions (on this method see [94]) rather
than their overall activation?

For instance, the recently developed Columbia Card Task
(CCT) [37] is dynamic and affective, and appears to be
decomposable. It remains to be seen whether cognitive
primitives of the CCT can be isolated using current modeling techniques in a neuroimaging study, and its predictive
validity is yet to be formally established.
As noted above, behavior in any task might vary systematically with state variables, such as arousal or motivation of participants at the time of elicitation, just as
naturalistic risk-taking does. This presents both a challenge to establishing predictive validity and an opportunity to determine moderators of emotional engagement.
Concluding remarks
There is still a great distance to cover in bridging the gap
between economic and naturalistic risk-taking, which we
suggest will require development of new empirical paradigms. Many existing paradigms exhibit one or two of the
three criteria suggested above. For instance, most tasks in
the neuroeconomics literature are decomposable but are
not especially predictively valid or emotionally engaging.
By contrast, tasks in the naturalistic side of the divide,
such as the BART and IGT, tend to be emotionally engaging and predictively valid, but not particularly decomposable. The ‘near-miss’ paradigm [60,62] provides another
example of an emotionally engaging and externally valid
task that is decomposable; however, it does not entail a
risky decision and thus is not designed to decompose
performance into economic variables related to risk-taking.
We propose that progress in understanding the neural
systems underlying naturalistic (including clinical and
abnormal) risk-taking awaits development of tasks that
fulfill all of these criteria (see also Box 4).
