Abstract
Life is full of risky decisions, from the mundane to matters of life or death. Individuals differ in the risks they accept (or even
deliberately embrace). However, risk taking is not a single trait but is a behavior influenced by characteristics of the situation
(what the decision is about and to what extent it engages affect vs. deliberation), the decision maker (age and gender), and
interactions between situation and decision maker. Understanding the mechanisms behind risk taking—or who takes risks when
and why—is particularly important when the goal is to influence and modify the behavior.
Keywords
risky decision making, domain-specific risk taking, individual differences, deliberative versus affective processes, Columbia
Card Task, DOSPERT scale, adolescence, gender differences

We constantly face situations that require us to decide between
actions that differ in level of risk. On your morning commute,
you can switch lanes to pass slower-moving vehicles at an
elevated chance of an accident or stay in the safer right-hand
lane. Filing your income tax return, you decide whether or not
to claim a questionable deduction that would reduce your
taxes but could lead to an audit. Your nephew wants to know
whether or not you will go bungee jumping with him. On a
night out, you have to decide whether or not to use a condom
that would reduce the probability of an STD infection but
might interrupt the passionate moment.
These examples make five important points. First, decisions between options that vary in risk occur in different
domains, from recreational choices to financial, social, health/
safety, and ethical decisions (Weber, Blais, & Betz, 2002).
Second, risky decisions involve different psychological processes. For some, “hot” affective processes are prominent
(e.g., condom decision), while others involve mainly “cold”
deliberative processes (e.g., tax decision; Figner, Mackinlay,
Wilkening, & Weber, 2009a). Third, options that carry higher
risk typically come with greater returns. Selecting riskier
options—because they promise higher returns—is sometimes
described as a tradeoff between risk and return. Risk attitude
reflects the relative weight a person gives to these two motivators. Fourth, the least attractive outcome in riskier options is
typically worse than the one in the safer options. Formally
more important, however, is that the riskier options involve
greater uncertainty about the resulting outcome: The term risk
taking refers to choosing the option with the higher outcome
variability—that is, with the wider range of possible outcomes.

None of these outcomes needs to be negative, although in realworld risky decisions they often are. Fifth and finally, risk taking is neither a unitary phenomenon nor a single personality
trait, and it can be motivated by various processes, not just risk
attitudes (i.e., an “appetite for risk”).
Much is known about how risky decisions are generally
made in laboratory studies, in which participants are typically
faced with a choice between a sure amount of money and a
lottery paying different amounts of money with specified
probabilities (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992; Weber & Johnson,
2008). However, risk taking also varies as a function of the
characteristics of the decision maker and the decision domain
and context—that is, of who takes risks when (Figner et al.,
2009a; Weber et al., 2002). Who? refers to individual differences in risk taking, among them age and gender differences.
When? addresses situational differences, among them the decision domain (Weber et al., 2002) and the extent to which the decision is emotionally charged (Figner et al., 2009a; Loewenstein,
Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001). Additionally, individual differences may interact with situational characteristics such that different whos react differently to different whens.
This review integrates a very rich and exciting literature on
risk taking by using examples from our own work to illustrate

the importance of individual differences, contextual influences, and their interaction in determining whether or not an
individual will engage in risky behavior. As to whens, we discuss the domain specificity of risk taking and the difference it
makes as to whether or not the situation triggers affective processes. These lead us into considering the question of two
whos, namely gender differences for domain specificity and
developmental differences for affective processes. We describe
empirical data and measures of risk taking, with less discussion of underlying theory (see Weber, 2010; Weber & Johnson,
2008). (The literature on risk taking discusses many other
whos, from genetic to cultural differences, and whens, from
framing to psychopathology; however, such a wide range of
topics is beyond the scope of this review.)

When: Domain-Specific Risk Taking
Risk taking is often domain specific, meaning that somebody’s
recreational risk taking may not predict his or her financial or
social risk taking. Weber et al.’s (2002) Domain-Specific
Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale assesses risk taking in six
domains: gambling, investing, ethical choices, and behaviors
relating to health/safety, social interaction, and recreation
(with an updated scale in Blais & Weber, 2006, and child/
adolescent versions being created). Importantly, it measures
not only risk taking but also expected benefits and perceived
risks of the described activities. The DOSPERT scale has been
translated into multiple languages and its identification of different degrees of risk taking in these six domains (rather than
a single, trait-like, risk-taking factor) replicates in a wide range
of populations and real-world settings (see www.dospert.org).
Documented risk takers in one domain (e.g., skydivers) tend to
score highly on the relevant DOSPERT subscale (e.g., recreational) but may have average risk-averse scores in other
domains (e.g., investing; Hanoch, Johnson, & Wilke, 2006).
Comparing many risk-taking scales used in applied settings,
Harrison, Young, Butow, Salkeld, and Solomon (2005) recommended the DOSPERT for its ability to assess risk taking in
different everyday domains and to separate perceptual and
attitudinal reasons for taking risks (Weber, 2010). Thus, an
important advantage of DOSPERT is that it assesses not just
risk-taking propensities but also two important motivators of
such behavior, namely perceived risks and benefits. Research
with the DOSPERT has demonstrated that, in many cases,
individual differences in risk taking are less driven by differences in the appetite for risk itself (the risk attitude) but by
individual differences in the perception of risks and returns.
The next section discusses this for gender differences.

Who: Gender Differences
Gender differences in risk taking are well documented. A
meta-analysis of 150 studies (Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999)
found that males take more risks than females do in the vast
majority of tasks (but see Weller, Levin, & Bechara, 2010).

Field studies of investing behavior report similar results
(Jianakoplos & Bernasek, 1998). A more controversial question is why these differences exist. Contrary to popular belief,
behavioral decision research suggests that gender differences
in risk taking (and cultural differences in risk taking more generally) are often mediated by culturally conditioned differences in the perceptions of risk and benefit (Weber & Johnson,
2008; Weber, 2010), rather than by differences in risk attitude.
Observed levels of risk taking can be seen as the result of a
tradeoff between the expected return of an option and the perceived risk of an option: Greater expected return makes an
option more attractive and thus typically leads to greater
approach, while greater perceived risk of an option typically
makes it less attractive and thus leads to greater avoidance
(somewhat metaphorically, this tradeoff is sometimes referred
to as a tradeoff between “greed” and “fear,” especially in the
finance literature). Importantly, observed differences in risktaking levels can be driven by individuals’ differences (a) in
the perceptions of the expected benefits, (b) in the perceptions
of the risks, and (c) in how much risk they are willing to accept
in exchange for a specific return. The latter is a person’s risk
attitude. As a simple example, most people are willing to
invest in relatively riskier stocks instead of relatively more
predictable bonds only when they think that the higher volatility of stocks (i.e., their greater riskiness) is compensated by
greater returns (i.e., their higher expected benefits). In the
DOSPERT framework, the coefficients in a regression that
measures the effects of perceived risks and benefits on risk
taking (typically positive for expected benefits and negative
for perceived risks) serves as a measure of a person’s risk attitude, indicating how many units of perceived risk he or she is
willing to trade off against units of expected benefits. These
coefficients vary between individuals (although most people
like benefits and dislike risk), but there are typically no systematic gender differences—appetite for risk itself does not
differ between genders.
Because risk–return trade-off models originally come from
the field of finance, expected benefits and risk are objective
measures in these models (usually expected value and variance, respectively). In contrast, psychological models of risk–
return tradeoffs make risk and return psychological constructs
and, accordingly, the perception of risks and returns can be
subjective and vary across decision makers and situational
contexts. Multiple studies using the DOSPERT and other tasks
have shown group (including gender and cultural) differences
in the perceptions of risks (Weber et al., 2002; Weber & Hsee,
1998) and benefits (Hanoch et al., 2006). Importantly, observed
gender differences in risk taking across domains—namely
women’s lower risk taking in financial, recreational, and
ethical decisions as well as their greater risk taking in social
decisions—can be explained by their risk perceptions. Women,
compared to men, perceive risks in financial, recreational, and
ethical domains to be higher but perceive risks to be lower
than males do in the social domain, which explains apparent
gender differences in risk taking. Risk perception, in turn, is

Risky Choice	
influenced by familiarity, both with risk taking in these
domains and with the available choice options (Weber,
Siebenmorgen, & Weber, 2005). Once the differences in perceptions are taken into account, the trade-off coefficient—that
is, the risk attitude—does not differ between genders, underscoring that it is often worth looking beyond observed risktaking levels into the motivators for such behaviors (however,
risk-taking differences cannot always be explained solely by
differences in perceptions; one such example is adolescents—
see below).

When: Affective and Deliberative Risk Taking
Risky decisions differ not only by domain but also in the psychological processes they involve. Whether decisions are
based on cold, deliberative calculus or hot, affective processes
(Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999) is of interest in decision-making
research (Weber & Johnson, 2009), particularly in the context
of risk taking. Affective processes and emotions can influence
decisions via multiple pathways, for example (a) by directing
attention to different characteristics of choice options (Weber
et al., 2005); (b) by influencing the translation of probabilities
and outcomes into subjective values (Tversky & Kahneman,
1992); and (c) by influencing the choice process itself more
directly, for example, when resisting temptation or succumbing to it (Figner et al., 2010). Affect can be integral or incidental, with integral affect deriving from the decision or choice
options at hand (e.g., excitement when putting all money on
red in roulette, or anger after losing), and incidental affect
deriving from a source unrelated to the decision (e.g., sadness
over a friend’s death may influence investment decisions, or
the joy over a bonus may lead to speeding on the highway).
Risk-taking domains differ in the extent to which they involve
hot or cold processes (e.g., gambling and recreational risk taking typically is hotter than investment risk taking), potentially
explaining domain differences at least in part. The next section
discusses the role of integral affect and its role in risk taking
by adolescents.

Who × When: Adolescent Risk Taking
Adolescents are known for taking great risks in many domains
(e.g., substance use, dangerous driving, unsafe sex). However,
surprisingly, in many laboratory tasks they do not show greater
risk taking than children or adults do (Byrnes et al., 1999; Figner
et al., 2009a). We hypothesized that adolescents show increased
risk taking only when affective processes are centrally involved,
with no substantial age differences for risky decisions made
under mostly cold/deliberative conditions. To test this, we created a hot and a cold version of a risky-decision-making task,
the Columbia Card Task (CCT; Figner et al., 2009a; Figner &
Voelki, 2004), shown and described in Figure 1.
The hot CCT is designed to trigger integral affect, using a
dynamic risk-taking task. In dynamic situations, decisions are
incremental and risks can increase over time, such that the risk

of an initial action (e.g., smoking the first cigarette) may be
relatively low but increases over repeated choices. While other
dynamics exist (risk may decrease or stay constant over time),
the increasing-risk dynamic is specifically interesting, as it
likely contributes to the difficulty to stop further risk taking. In
many dynamically increasing risky-choice situations, the decision maker will typically first experience mostly positive outcomes (as the probability for a negative outcome is relatively
low in the beginning, hence the term increasing-risk dynamic).
Thus, at least initially, choosing the risky option is likely to be
rewarded and therefore reinforced, which in turn can contribute to the difficulty of stopping when the risks increase to a
point where—without the earlier positive outcomes—the
decision maker otherwise would not be willing to take these
risks. In the hot CCT, such a risk-increasing dynamic is set
into motion by having participants turn over cards sequentially
with immediate outcome feedback provided after each card.
Across different rounds of the game, gain amount, loss amount,
and number of loss cards differ. Variation on these three crucial components in risk taking is an advantage the CCT has
over other dynamic risk tasks, because it allows for the assessment of whether and how the components influence the risky
decisions and enables us to distinguish between different motivations for risk taking—for example, gain sensitivity, loss sensitivity, and probability sensitivity (see Schonberg, Fox, &
Poldrack, 2010).
The cold CCT is similar to the hot version but reduces
involvement of affective processes by employing a singletime decision and by delaying outcome feedback until all
game rounds have been played (see Fig. 1). Self-reports and
skin conductance, a physiological measure of emotional
arousal (Figner & Murphy, 2011), verify that the hot CCT triggers stronger affective processes than does the cold CCT,
which triggers more deliberative decision processes (Figner
et al., 2009a).
As predicted, adolescents take more risks than children and
adults only in the hot CCT. In the cold CCT, adolescents take
similar risks as children and adults (Figner et al., 2009a;
Figner, Mackinlay, Wilkening, & Weber, 2009b). Risk taking
in the hot (but not cold) CCT is accompanied by diminished
information use. Participants who take greater risks neglect
relevant information—that is, fail to appropriately adjust the
number of cards they turn over—particularly in response to
changes in the magnitude of the loss. Adolescents’ risk-taking
in the hot (but not cold) CCT is also related to a measure of
cognitive control. Those better able to inhibit prepotent
responses in a so-called Go/No-Go task take less risk in the
hot CCT (Figner et al., 2009b).
These results are consistent with recent neurodevelopmental data showing that brain networks involved in different psychological functions mature at differential speeds (e.g.,
Gladwin, Figner, Crone, & Wiers, in press; Somerville, Jones,
& Casey, 2010; see also Ernst & Fudge, 2009; Steinberg,
2010; for an alternative model, see Reyna & Farley, 2006; for
a general developmental overview of risk taking, see Boyer,

Fig. 1.  Screenshot of the hot version of the Columbia Card Task (CCT; for more information, see
www.columbiacardtask.org). Each new game round starts with a score of 0 points and all 32 cards shown
back (i.e., question mark) side up. Participants turn over one card after the other and receive feedback
after each card (whether the turned card was a gain card—one with a smiley face—or a loss card). A game
round continues (and points accumulate) until the player decides to stop or until he or she turns over a
loss card, which leads to a large loss of points and automatically ends the current game round. The main
variable of interest is how many cards participants turn over before they decide to stop. The number of
cards chosen indicates risk taking because each decision to turn over an additional card increases the
outcome variability, as the probability of a negative outcome (turning over a loss card) increases and the
probability of a positive outcome (turning over a gain card) decreases. Across different rounds of the game,
three variables systematically vary, the magnitude of gain (Gain Amount; here 10 points per good card), the
magnitude of loss (Loss Amount; here 250 points), and the probability to incur a gain or a loss (Number
of Loss Cards; here 1 loss card).

2006): Networks related to reward sensitivity (e.g., how
strongly one is tempted by the possible reward in a risky situation) mature early in adolescence, whereas networks related
to cognitive control (e.g., the ability to resist such temptations
and, instead of taking a dangerous risk, wait a second and
think about it twice) mature more slowly in late adolescence
and early adulthood. The hypothesized result of these different
maturation speeds is an increased tendency to take greater
risks during adolescence, but only in situations in which the
affective system is involved. Without affective triggers, no
strong temptations or prepotent impulses are created, so there
is no need for cognitive control (Figner et al., 2010; for another
example of an inverted U-shape age pattern in risk taking, see
Burnett, Bault, Coricelli, & Blakemore, 2010; for hot/cold
differences in adolescents’ risky choice, similar to what we
found with the CCT, see van Duijvenvoorde, Jansen, Visser, &
Huizenga, 2010; and for peer presence increasing risk taking
in adolescents but not adults, see Gardner & Steinberg, 2005).
Finally, affect is not a unitary phenomenon, and a fascinating question is which aspects of affect—for example, its
intensity (degree of arousal) or its valence (positivity or negativity)—lead to differences in risk taking and by what processes. It has recently been proposed that affect in decision
making can serve as information (“How do I feel about this

choice option?”), common currency (allowing us to compare
the value of very different options or attributes—for example,
a weak electric shock and doing a boring task for 10 minutes),
motivator (for example, choosing options that more likely
keep our mood positive), and spotlight (for example, whether
we focus on positive or negative aspects of the options; Peters,
Vastfjall, Garling, & Slovic, 2006). Future research to investigate the differential contributions of these roles to adolescent
(and others’) risk taking is needed.

Conclusion
Risk taking is not the expression of a single personality trait.
Thus, people’s risk attitude cannot be inferred directly from
their degree of risk taking in a single situation. Instead, risk taking is influenced by characteristics of the person (Who?—e.g.,
age and gender) and the situation (When?—e.g., the decisiondomain, whether affect is involved), and often the who and the
when interact (e.g., via the individual’s familiarity with a risk
domain). Accordingly, it should be no surprise that different
measures of risk taking (e.g., general risk-attitude surveys and
other self-reports, choices in lottery tasks, real-world decisions)
do not always strongly correlate, as the context and the processes in making these decisions matter. However, simply

Risky Choice	
describing observed levels of risk taking by different individuals in different situations is unsatisfactory. Instead, we think it is
important to understand the Why? of risk taking, especially
when the goal is to help people make better decisions under
conditions of risk—for example, with interventions like
decision-aiding Web sites or by laws or regulations that may
change attention, familiarity, and incentives. As we have seen,
differences in observed risk-taking levels can be caused by very
different processes—for example, the subjective perceptions of
risks and benefits that can differ between genders or, in the case
of adolescents, the interplay of strong affective impulses with
immature abilities to resist and control temptations. Risk taking
is the result of both deliberative and affective evaluations of
available choice options, and conflicting motivations (e.g.,
greed/approach and fear/avoidance) need to be balanced. Risktaking assessment instruments like the DOSPERT and the hot
and cold CCT allow us to evaluate how these different processes
contribute to observed risk-taking levels. Better understanding
of the causal mechanisms that underlie risk taking in specific
situations and specific populations provides us with entry points
for the design of interventions that can successfully modify risk
taking in situations where decision makers and society desire
such behavior change.
