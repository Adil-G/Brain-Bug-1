We investigated how the knowledge capabilities of industry incumbents affected the
generation, development, and performance of “spin-outs” (entrepreneurial ventures of
ex-employees). Analyses of 1977–97 data from the disk drive industry supported our
hypothesis that incumbents with both strong technological and market pioneering
know-how generate fewer spin-outs than firms with strength in only one of these areas.
Also, an incumbent’s capabilities at the time of a spin-out’s founding positively affect
the spin-out’s knowledge capabilities and its probability of survival.

cumbent. Operating at the forefront of innovation,
spin-outs pose a special threat to incumbents since
they can capitalize on knowledge gained from discoveries made during the course of their founders’
employment in incumbent firms (Bhide, 2000).
Since spin-outs are a new topic for management
research, we attempted to systematically examine
some fundamental questions that are key to developing a theory-based understanding of spin-outs:
What types of firms are most likely to generate
spin-outs? Is there a knowledge legacy that links
incumbent parents to spin-outs? What are the implications of such heritage?
Our study builds on existing research that
has studied how historical antecedents affect entrants’ resource heterogeneity. For example, there
is evidence that experience within existing markets shapes a firm’s knowledge resources and
therefore influences performance in markets into
which the firm diversifies (Carroll, Bigelow,
Seidal, & Tsai, 1996; Klepper & Simons, 2000;
Nelson & Winter, 1982). Research has also suggested that routines and resources transfer from
old to new organizations through personnel migration (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Almeida &
Kogut, 1999; Pfeffer & Leblebici, 1973). Thus, it is
suggested that prior employment affiliations
may influence not only new venture formation
(Burton, Søorensen, & Beckman, 2002; Shane &
Khurana, 1999), but also product-market strategies (Boeker, 1997) and firm survival (Bruderl,

In certain high-technology industries, spinouts—a distinctive class of entrepreneurial entrants
that inherit knowledge from industry incumbents
through their founders—are not only legion, but are
also major innovators. Spin-outs (entrepreneurial
ventures by ex-employees of an incumbent firm)
are widespread in industries such as semiconductors (Braun & MacDonald, 1978), disk drives
(Christensen, 1993), and lasers (Klepper & Sleeper,
2000). Fairchild Semiconductor’s many spin-outs
(dubbed “Fairchildren” [Klepper, 2001]) are a salient example. Founded by former employees of an
incumbent firm, these stand-alone entrepreneurial
ventures compete in the same industry as the parent but have no equity relationships with any in-

Preisendorfer, & Ziegler, 1992; Phillips, 2002).
However, despite evidence that preentry experience matters and that new firm know-how may
originate in older firms (Stinchcombe, 1965), a
few significant gaps remain in researchers’ understanding of the birth and development of
knowledge-based capabilities in new ventures
(Helfat & Lieberman, 2002; Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt,
2000).
First, although there is some evidence that
knowledge-rich firms tend to be “entrepreneurial
hotbeds” and more prone to spawning spin-outs
(Burton et al., 2002; Franco & Filson, 2000; Garvin,
1983), this relationship is underdeveloped in the
literature, both conceptually and empirically. Does
abundant knowledge per se lead to employee entrepreneurship, or is it contingent on a firm’s use of
its know-how? Given that the values of different
types of know-how may be interdependent (Moran
& Ghoshal, 1999; Teece, 1986), the impact of a
firm’s organization of its know-how on employee
entrepreneurship may be more complex than hitherto supposed. Second, past authors have assumed
an underlying process of knowledge inheritance by
a progeny firm, without explicitly testing whether
inheritance from an incumbent parent actually occurs (e.g., Phillips, 2002). Therefore, it is unclear
whether knowledge is in fact inherited, and how
preentry affiliation with an incumbent shapes a
start-up’s knowledge endowments. Third, little research has systematically linked inherited knowledge to organizational outcomes (Huber, 1991). It is
not clear whether the imprinting effects of initial
knowledge endowments persist, or whether they
affect organizational learning over time. In addition, there has been very little scrutiny of how
employee entrepreneurship as the agent of tacit
know-how affects the “stickiness” of knowledge
transfer (Szulanski, 1996) and therefore its internalization within a progeny firm. Finally, little is
known about how the preentry incumbent affiliation of entrepreneurial firms affects survival.
In this study, we addressed the above gaps by
developing and testing a theoretical framework
linking knowledge inheritance to spin-out formation, development, and survival. We considered
two specific types of know-how, namely, technological and market pioneering, which form the
bases of innovation and marketing-based differentiation. It is generally believed that these capabilities underlie strategic renewal in high-technology
markets, where frequent technological disruptions
create new opportunities alongside obsolescence
(Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Daneels, 2002; Teece,
Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). We used data on the rigid
disk drive industry, the “fruit fly of industries,” so

called because of its rapid technological changes
(Christensen, 1993). Since spin-outs constitute a
significant percentage of new entrants in this industry, it was a particularly appropriate setting for
our study.
Our article thus contributes new work on an underresearched phenomenon. By suggesting that the
organization of capabilities may be as important a
source of performance heterogeneity as the capabilities themselves, our research advances understanding of the “resource-based view” (Barney,
1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) of the firm. Our study also
contributes to emerging ideas surrounding strategic
entrepreneurship (Hitt, Ireland, Camp, & Sexton,
2001). Further, we add to the entrepreneurship literature by investigating the impact of both entrepreneurial flexibility and resources inherited
through the preentry experience of founders on
new venture performance.
KNOWLEDGE INHERITANCE THROUGH
EMPLOYEE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
According to a knowledge-based perspective, the
underlying principle of organization is the generation, combination-recombination, and exploitation
of knowledge (Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Kogut &
Zander, 1996). In particular, the focus is on tacit
knowledge that is acquired largely through personal experience, such as learning by doing or by
observing (Nonaka, 1994). Knowledge possessed
within an existing organization is typically viewed
through the lens of competitive advantage (Barney,
1991; Grant, 1996). New knowledge that results
from technological breakthroughs or customer insights, however, is also the fountainhead of new
firm entry (Gort & Klepper, 1982; Schumpeter,
1934). Since knowledge is potentially appropriable
by individuals that possess it (Arrow, 1962), employees of incumbent firms are in a position to start
their own ventures using new knowledge created
through incumbent investments. Thus, the potential for employee entrepreneurship results from
incumbent firms being imperfect and permeable
repositories of knowledge and causes new organizations to emerge from other organizations (Stinchcombe, 1965). Moreover, the effect of lineage may
extend beyond formation, as the transfer of rules,
routines, and procedures from parent to progeny
organizations both constrains and empowers the
new firms (Brittain & Freeman, 1986; Romanelli,
1991). However, there is a void in scholars’ understanding of the forces governing spin-out formation
and evolution, as conceptual and empirical research in this area is still underdeveloped. Extant
work can be categorized into three research

<-----Page 2----->2004

Agarwal, Echambadi, Franco, and Sarkar

streams: knowledge spillovers as the source of new
firm formation, inherited knowledge as the source
of new firm know-how, and the impact of genesis
on new firm outcome. We briefly review these three
theoretical streams since they form the basis for our
hypotheses relating to spin-out generation, development, and survival.
The first research stream, on knowledge spillovers through employee mobility, has focused on
the threat of voluntary exits from firms of experts
who possess critical know-how, a threat causing
technology-rich firms to be known as “precarious
monopolies” (Stinchcombe & Heimer, 1988;
Zucker, Darby, & Brewer, 1998). A firm’s tacit
knowledge is not only team-based and socially embedded in routines (Nelson & Winter, 1982), but
also resident in individual human capital (Berman,
Down, & Hill, 2002; Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, &
Kochhar, 2001; Lepak & Snell, 1999; Szulanski,
1996). As employees internalize an organization’s
culture (Inzerille & Rosen, 1983; Meek, 1988), they
imbibe procedural and declarative knowledge related to functional capabilities such as R&D and
marketing. Human capital is mobile since employees are under limited organizational control and
free to quit at will (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Boeker,
1997; Coff, 1997). Owing to inherent difficulties in
detecting knowledge expropriation (Arrow, 1962)
and the limited effectiveness of market mechanisms in protecting knowledge (Liebeskind 1996),
employees may leave and expropriate their employer’s know-how. Although firms can increase
employees’ exit costs and impose “golden handcuffs” (Liebeskind, 1996), these incentive mechanisms are subject to agency costs. “Moral hazard”
(Wiggins, 1995) and “information asymmetry” (Anton & Yao, 1995) create contractual problems between employees and their employers. As a result,
incentives provided by incumbent firms to lock in
their employees (and their knowledge) may not be
effective because the potential rewards to the employees are greater in entrepreneurial ventures.
These studies therefore have suggested that a genealogical knowledge-based framework may explain
new venture formation.
Researchers pursuing a related stream of research
have focused on knowledge transfer from a recipient organization’s perspective and investigated
knowledge diffusion and the interorganizational
social structure created by executive migration (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Boeker, 1997). Various difficulties involved in the transfer of “sticky” tacit
knowledge have been acknowledged (von Hippel,
1994), but research has emphasized that organizational blueprints can transfer across firm boundaries, in a manner analogous to the reproduction

503

and transmission of biological genes (Winter,
1991). These transfers may include unique insights
and decision rules used to transform resources into
action (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986), cognitive dimensions of competency (Fiol, 1991), and specific
knowledge and information (Boeker, 1997). Since
“what an organization knows at its birth will determine what it searches for, what it experiences, and
how it interprets what it encounters” (Huber, 1991:
91), one implication is that a spin-out’s capability
accumulation may be linked to its inherited knowledge and that the agent of transfer may have an
impact on the efficacy of transfer.
Finally, heterogeneity in entrant capabilities has
been related to the prior affiliation and preentry
knowledge of firms (Carroll et al., 1996; Helfat &
Lieberman, 2002; Klepper & Simons, 2000). Other
work has also suggested that entrepreneurial origin
is an important source of resource differences,
strategies, and performance (Knight, 1989; McGrath
& MacMillan, 2000; Shrader & Simon, 1997). Therefore, entrepreneurial origin combined with prior
founder affiliation may have different survival implications for spin-outs than for other entrants.
Each of the research streams outlined above provides a foundation for theorizing about the knowledge relationships between incumbent parents and
their spin-outs, the knowledge relationships between spin-outs and other entrants, and organizational life chances. In developing our hypotheses,
we integrated these theoretical perspectives and
related them to spin-out generation, inheritance,
and performance.
Incumbent Knowledge and Spin-out Generation
As firms face the frequent disruptions that characterize high-technology markets, their ability to
seize new opportunities or withstand threats of obsolescence depends on their capacity to reconfigure
resources “ahead of competitors.” That capacity in
turn depends on their R&D and marketing-related
capabilities (Daneels, 2002; Teece, 1986). The potential value of a firm’s R&D efforts can be unlocked
and appropriated in the marketplace by understanding and satisfying new customer needs
quickly (Jaworski & Kohli, 1993; Narver & Slater,
1990). Thus, while a firm’s technological knowhow reflects its ability to generate new scientific
discoveries and technological breakthroughs, its
market pioneering know-how indicates whether it
can commercialize technological innovations before competitors do. The ability to pioneer markets
is especially critical in markets with short product
life cycles, where prices tend to drop sharply after
an initial period (Hatch & Macher, 2002). The two

<-----Page 3----->504

capabilities are thus complementary: technological
innovations need to be transformed into “killer applications” before a firm can reap the rewards of its
R&D capabilities (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Moran
& Ghoshal, 1999; Teece, 1986).
Firms with abundant know-how in either dimension are likely to be associated with a higher potential to generate spin-outs. First, the place of employment may influence an employee’s ability to
perceive an entrepreneurial prospect. Employees of
firms with abundant knowledge may possess
unique and idiosyncratic information that enables
them to discover potential opportunities ahead of
others. Since knowledge asymmetry lies at the
heart of entrepreneurship, such access to valuable
knowledge can be a source of advantage (Venkataraman, 1997). Working with firms at the cutting
edge may help to create a “knowledge corridor”
that facilitates opportunity recognition by enhancing the ability to understand, infer, and creatively
extend knowledge in new ways (Roberts, 1991).
Further, the quality of research discussions and
social interactions is likely to be substantively different in a premier research institution from what it
is in others. Scientists have been known to undergo
short-term financial sacrifices to apprentice for
firms that are on the technological frontier and thus
enhance their knowledge (Franco & Filson, 2000;
Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001). Since
exploiting an opportunity in the market is dependent on discovering it, and the discovery of new
entrepreneurial opportunities may be triggered by
prior information and existing capabilities (Shane,
2000), employees at firms that are at the cutting
edge of know-how may be more likely to perceive
entrepreneurial opportunities.
Second, affiliation benefits may make it easier for
employees of leading firms to raise the financial
and other resources needed to start new ventures.
Raising capital is a process that is fraught with
information asymmetry between provider and recipient (Brav & Gompers, 1997). The newer the
technology and the more nascent the market, the
greater the information asymmetry and associated
uncertainty about a venture’s prospects. In the absence of unambiguous quality measures, investors
depend on certification cues in making judgments.
Such cues can emanate from institutional affiliations (Gompers & Lerner, 2001; Shane & Khurana,
1999). Affiliation with a high-status organization
influences not only perceptions of employees’
skills and trustworthiness (Davis, 1991; Eisenhardt
& Schoonhoven, 1996), but also perceptions of the
importance of innovations in emerging areas of
technology (Podolny & Stuart, 1995). Would-be
founders’ prior employment with a “marquee firm”

August

transfers status and legitimizes a new venture
(Podolny, 1994; Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999).
Employees of knowledge-rich firms thus benefit
from enhanced “entrepreneurial capital” (Aldrich,
Renzulli, & Langton, 1998), which facilitates mobilization of the resources necessary to undertake an
entrepreneurial venture (Burton et al., 2002; Higgins & Gulati, 2003). As a result, the place of prior
employment can influence access not only to opportunities but also to resources (Granovetter,
1985).
Thus, firms with abundant knowledge may be
more prone to creating spin-outs because opportunity recognition and investor confidence are
heightened. We suggest, however, that whether employees act on these potential opportunities and
undertake the entrepreneurial act is likely to depend on how well incumbent firms utilize their
knowledge. When an organization’s strategy emphasizes either technological know-how or market
pioneering know-how, identified but unexploited
opportunities result. New scientific breakthroughs
that are not commercialized and marketing insights
into emerging and unfulfilled customer needs that
are not met with technological breakthroughs are
both symptomatic of underexploited know-how.
We suggest two reasons why it is not abundant
knowledge as such that creates spin-outs, as past
research has suggested (Garvin, 1983), but the manner in which a company uses such knowledge.
First, when firms do not simultaneously develop
their technological and market pioneering knowhow, they are likely to create frustration among
their employees, who perceive their organization as
systematically missing out on either value-creating
or value-appropriating opportunities. For example,
Christensen (1993) showed how a firm’s dependence on existing customers not only hampered
efforts to reorient market strategies, but frustrated
engineers whose technological inventions were not
commercialized. When firms develop promising
technological inventions but fail to marshal the
commitment to take the technologies to market,
their behavioral inertia and inaction may result in a
growing gap between employees’ aspirations and
their current prospects within the firms (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). Such divergence in organizational and individual goals may lower job satisfaction and increase employee turnover (Benkhoff,
1997) as well as employees’ risk propensity (Greve,
1998) and their desire to venture out on their own.
On the other hand, by using their know-how and
responding to technological and market-pioneering
opportunities, organizations prevent the aggravation and frustration that builds up among scientists
and other professional employees when they per-

<-----Page 4----->2004

Agarwal, Echambadi, Franco, and Sarkar

ceive their ideas and inventions are being shelved
(Christensen, 1993; Garvin, 1983). For firms that
invest in both know-how dimensions concurrently,
the complementarity of technological and market
pioneering know-how (Griffin & Hauser, 1996;
Teece, 1986) not only creates a valuable synergy,
but also, by aligning organizational and individual
goals, reduces frustration, thereby inhibiting employee entrepreneurship.
Second, the perception of available opportunities
for profitable entrepreneurial entry may also be
related to whether or not an incumbent organization exploits its know-how. Noncommercialized
technologies and unexploited market opportunities, particularly those that are substantial and
path-breaking, increase employees’ confidence
about venturing out, and thus their entrepreneurial
propensity (Eisenhardt, 1989). On the other hand,
incumbent organizations that possess both highend technological and market pioneering knowhow exhibit a “willingness to cannibalize” (Chandy
& Tellis, 1998; Kamien & Schwartz, 1982). Thus, an
incumbent’s unwillingness to pursue certain technologies may cause employees to perceive abundant entrepreneurial opportunities and hence
lower entry and survival barriers for their own ventures, while preemptive incumbent entry into an
emerging niche or technological subfield may deter
spin-out formation by restricting the availability of
attractive opportunities.
In summary, given its effect on both internal
employee motivation and external market opportunities, we propose that although an abundance of
underutilized knowledge can beget spin-outs, such
incidents are deterred when the knowledge of a
firm is put to use.1 We accordingly hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1. Increases in either technological
or market pioneering know-how enhance the
likelihood of spin-out generation; however, increases in both technological and market pioneering know-how decrease this likelihood.
Inherited Knowledge as a Source of Spin-out
Knowledge
Organizational sociologists have theorized about
the interorganizational transfer of routines and resources (Brittain & Freeman, 1980; Hannan & Freeman, 1986). Such routines find expression in not
only R&D functions and marketing strategy, but
also in idiosyncratic knowledge about technologies
and customers (Thompson, 1967). Moreover, a

complex and critical part of technology and marketing know-how is their “softer” side, which goes
beyond codified knowledge available in scientific
papers, formulae, technical specifications, blueprints, strategy reports, and hardware and is held
by individual employees in the form of tacit knowledge and competence assets (Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Teece, 1988). When employees leave to start new
ventures, they walk out with tacit knowledge. Intimate knowledge about technology and markets can
transfer across organizations from an incumbent
parent to a spin-out through founders. The initial
knowledge endowment of a spin-out will then be
connected to the parent’s knowledge at the time the
founder worked with the incumbent.
This initial stock of inherited knowledge (Huber,
1991) is likely to have long-term effects on a spinout. According to Stinchcombe (1965), founding
conditions “imprint” an organization on various
levels—including its structure, strategy, technology, routines, and culture (Sastry & Coen, 2000)—
and continue to have long-term effects. Further, an
organization’s absorptive capacity (its ability, efficiency, and aspiration to learn, discover, and acquire new knowledge) is also linked to its level of
prior related knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990).
Differences in initial endowments may position
firms on heterogeneous developmental paths
(Shane & Stuart, 2002), thus implying that inherited knowledge may be related to a spin-out’s
knowledge accumulation over time. Simply put,
smart parents are likely to have smart progeny.
Since starting with a good model can affect subsequent firm performance (Cyert, Kumar, & Williams,
1993), superior knowledge endowments at birth
can result in longer-term knowledge superiority.
Thus,
Hypothesis 2. The levels of a spin-out firm’s (a)
technological and (b) market pioneering knowhow over time will be positively related to the
level of its parent’s (a) technological and (b)
market pioneering know-how, respectively, at
the time of the spin-out’s inception.
Spin-out Knowledge Capabilities and Survival
Owing to their inherited knowledge and entrepreneurial origin, spin-outs may differ in their
knowledge and survival probabilities from other
entrants. We used Helfat and Lieberman’s (2002)
refinement of a coarse-grained distinction between
de novo and de alio entrants based on pre-entry
experience (Carroll et al. 1996; Klepper & Simons,
2000). Among entrepreneurial de novo entrants, we
distinguished between spin-outs and non-spin-

<-----Page 5----->506

outs, since spin-outs inherit knowledge from an
industry incumbent. Among de alio entrants, we
distinguished between diversifying entrants and
incumbent-backed ventures. Diversifying entrants
are established firms in other industries that enter a
focal industry. Incumbent-backed ventures represent separate legal entities with ties to incumbent
firms (such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, franchisees, and spin-offs).2
Entrant knowledge capabilities. Among the
four types of entrants, both incumbent-backed ventures and spin-outs benefit from direct knowledge
transfers from incumbents. Just as spin-outs inherit
knowledge from parent firms through founders,
incumbent-backed ventures obtain knowledge
through cooperative relationships with the incumbents at birth, and perhaps on a continuing basis.
Thus, given their links to incumbents, we did not
hypothesize any knowledge difference between
these two groups, leaving the matter as an empirical issue. Diversifying and non-spin-out de novo
entrants, however, learn either by doing or by indirect “grafts,” such as recruiting employees who
work in the relevant industry (Boeker, 1997; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). We argue that, compared
with these two entrant types, spin-outs have an
advantage, because the agents of knowledge transfer are founders as opposed to recruited employees.
We base our hypothesis on the premise that
founders can realize a more effective transfer of
sticky knowledge (von Hippel, 1994; Szulanski,
1996) to their organizations than can hired employees who lack such a pivotal role.
Knowledge is said to be sticky if organizations
encounter difficulties in its internal transfer (von
Hippel, 1994). Stickiness results from the additional costs incurred during the adoption of complex technology and business processes, which involve their conscious reconstruction, diffusion,
and integration into new routines within an organization. Such stickiness causes knowledge, particularly its tacit component, to lie inert in some part
of an organization—acquired, yet not readily accessible or retrievable, and therefore not deployable
and convertible into value when required (Whitehead, 1929). As a result, “organizations may not
necessarily know all that they know” (Szulanski,
2000: 10) and fall short of fully exploiting their
know-how (von Hippel, 1994).

2

Incumbent-backed ventures are hybrids, part diversifying and part de novo entrant. The existing firm that
backs such a venture may have a financial stake in it, or
board of director representation, but it is a new company
and a separate legal entity (Helfat & Lieberman, 2002).

August

We posit that the directness of knowledge transfer through employee-founders reduces stickiness
and increases a firm’s ability to integrate and successfully acquire knowledge. First, the general
management role of entrepreneurial founders enables them to have a holistic picture. Employees
recruited from incumbents may have limited ability to transfer relevant resources across different
departments of a new organization. Further, their
functional identification may actually decrease information dissemination through the organization
(Fisher, Maltz, & Jaworski, 1997). Acting as knowledge brokers between functional domains and various employees, founders, on the other hand, can
increase the likelihood of employees adopting a
new practice (Lenox & King, 2003). By being in a
more influential position to bring about progressive
routinization of “best practices,” founders have an
advantage over hired lower-level employees in effecting the transfer of knowledge that they bring
into firms. Second, founders have incentives and
the motivation to share their knowledge and transform it into best practices, so as to appropriate full
benefits from their know-how, but employees may
be subject to agency problems and competitive incentive structures that can create exchange dynamics in internal knowledge markets that discourage
sharing knowledge (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Since power in an organization depends on having
nonreplicated knowledge, employees may prefer
not to lose their knowledge monopolies. Founders
face no such divergence between their own and an
organization’s goals, causing useful knowledge to
be disseminated within the organization more
easily.
Finally, the founding teams of spin-outs are
likely to have knowledge advantages over employees hired individually into new firms. Typically,
multiple employees from diverse backgrounds or
firms come together to start a new firm. Armed with
insider industry knowledge, ex-employee founders
are likely to conduct active and more fruitful
searches than other founders or entrants for specific pockets of complementary knowledge in their
former employing firms or their social networks in
an industry to create synergy among the individual
components of know-how. This synergy increases
the potential value of their combined know-how
(Dess & Shaw, 2001) in spin-outs. Owing to the
availability of industry-specific information through
prior industry affiliation, spin-outs have a knowledge advantage over other entrants. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 3. Spin-outs will have higher levels

pioneering know-how than both non-spin-out
de novo and diversifying entrants.
Entrant survival. Spin-outs, as an organizational
form that represents employee entrepreneurship,
may also be advantaged over other types of entrants
on a key dimension of performance, namely, survival. Spin-outs have both inside knowledge of
their industry, and entrepreneurial origin, which
has been argued to be an important source of resource differences, strategies, and performance
(Knight, 1989; Shrader & Simon, 1997). Each dimension, we posit, gives spin-outs survival advantages over the other three entrant groups.
Spin-outs, just like non-spin-out de novo entrants, are entrepreneurial entrants. However,
they also have the benefit of insider status, which
means that their initial resource endowments are
likely to be superior to those of other de novo
firms. In addition to having technological and
marketing knowledge, spin-out founders are
likely to benefit from their previous employer’s
contacts and from network ties (Higgins & Gulati,
2003; Yli-Renko, Autio, & Sapienza, 2001). Further, spin-outs are likely to bring in routines and
processes and links with customers that enable
them to better overcome liabilities of newness
(Phillips, 2002). In addition, as Shane and Stuart
(2002) found, founders’ social capital is positively related to survival. While all founders may
bring in some social capital, the social capital of
spin-out founders is likely to be more closely
related to the industry that they operate in and,
therefore, more valuable than the social capital of
those who lack prior incumbent affiliation. Thus,
in keeping with the findings of Phillips (2002),
we expected spin-out firms to have a survival
advantage over other de novo entrants.
Relative to diversifying entrants, spin-out firms
are advantaged in terms of both their founders’
access to industry-related information and their
entrepreneurial origin. While diversifying entrants may have access to resources and capital,
these resources may not be as directly related to
the focal industry as the resources garnered by
spin-out firms through their own networks and
social capital. Higher autonomy, lack of bureaucratic inertia, and simple structures enable entrepreneurial spin-outs to creatively combine and
exchange resources more quickly than diversifying entrants. Diversifying entrants frequently suffer from conflicting signals and role confusion
stemming from vested interests in the established
organizations that are creating them (Haveman,
1992), and the entrants’ managers may face a
variety of political and corporate objectives that

507

pull them in different directions. Corporate authority and the need to obtain clearance on strategic decisions may create organizational inertia
in diversifying entrants, giving spin-outs a learning advantage in dynamic environments (Carroll
et al., 1996), since they can move more quickly
and decisively to deploy new knowledge routines
(Rosenbloom & Christensen, 1994). The managers
of diversifying entrants are likely to be evaluated
on the basis of how closely they adhere to a
corporate plan, but spin-out founders are motivated by the ends achieved, because their livelihood is tied to their ventures’ performance. Thus,
relative to diversifying entrants too, spin-out
firms should have a survival advantage.
Finally, compared with incumbent-backed
ventures, spin-outs lack parental support. It may
seem that parental backing, in cushioning the
liability of newness, advantages incumbentbacked ventures. However, this advantage may be
slight for two reasons. First, continued parental
involvement may result in the same organizational inertia among incumbent-backed ventures
that is faced by diversifying entrants. Second,
underutilization of knowledge resources by incumbents may set into play certain self-selection
processes whereby the characteristics of employees that venture out on their own work in favor of
spin-outs. Research has revealed that an entrepreneurial mind-set may be distinct from a managerial one (McGrath & MacMillan 2000). Entrepreneurs tend to have a higher risk-taking
propensity, lower uncertainty avoidance, and a
preference for innovative behavior (Carland, Carland, & Stewart, 1996; Drucker, 1995). These are
traits that match the requirements of hightechnology markets (Moriarty & Kosnik, 1989).
Further, expectations of success are linked to
the choice of undertaking an entrepreneurial venture, and individuals’ expectations of success
through entrepreneurship are related to their
assessments of personal capabilities and to accessible resources and earlier investments in
relevant resources (Blumberg & Pfann, 2001).
Therefore, as incumbents fail to utilize opportunities, it is those employees with entrepreneurial
capital and ability who are likely to depart and
form spin-outs. Spin-outs, manned by personnel
with greater entrepreneurial zeal and ability than
other entrants, may thus ultimately fare better
than incumbent-backed ventures. Therefore,
Hypothesis 4. The likelihood of survival will be
greater for spin-out entrants than for all other
types of entrants.

METHODS
Context: The Rigid Disk Drive Industry
We tested our hypotheses using data from the
rigid disk drive industry from 1977 to 1997. Disk
drives are magnetic information storage devices
used in computers. The industry is a particularly
appropriate setting owing to its rapid pace of technological evolution, which is detailed below, and
its large number of entrants, of which a high percentage were spin-outs. (See Christensen [1993,
1997] for a detailed industry history.)
The availability of longitudinal data is a chief
constraint to studies such as ours. To maintain
accuracy, particularly on firms’ early histories, we
collected data from sources that documented facts
about firms and the industry at the time of occurrence and tracked information on important historical events in the industry for all firms entering and
exiting the market. As have a number of past researchers (Christensen, 1993; King & Tucci, 2002;
Lerner, 1997), we used information compiled from
the Disk/Trend Report, a market research publication that has covered the disk drive industry since
1977. We identified the existence and type of preentry affiliation of all entering firms, and in particular determined parent-progeny relationships for
spin-outs, using background information on the
founders of new firms from the Disk/Trend Report.
Company press reports and news releases and various technological sources, scientific journals,
books, articles in periodicals, chronologies, and directories (for instance, the Directory of Corporate
Affiliations and the International Directory of
Company Histories) were used to supplement. The
database included all firms in the industry during 1977–97 for which we found information on
the introduction times of new products within
the industry, product characteristics, and annual
sales of disk drives. Since every productive firm,
regardless of size, was included for its span of
existence in the market, our sample does not
suffer from a survival bias.
Pace of Technological Change in the Disk Drive
Industry
In 1973, IBM pioneered the 14-inch Winchester,
the first completely sealed and removable disk
drive, and the disk drive industry experienced numerous innovations in the following 20 years. Architectural innovations resulted in five new subsequent diameters and created new submarkets (the
8-inch in 1979, the 5.25-inch in 1980, the 3.75-inch
in 1983, the 2.5-inch in 1988, and the 1.8-inch in
1991). In addition to these disruptive innovations,

within each diameter, several modular and incremental innovations resulted in dramatic increases
in “areal density,” defined as the megabytes of information that can be stored on a square inch of a
particular drive. Enabling cross-diameter comparisons, areal density is generally used as an industry
standard to determine a drive’s technological advancement. The main product performance measure for drives, it represents a combination of
technologies—access speed, head technology, and
recording technology. Research groups within disk
drive firms report that increasing storage capacity
is the key challenge and focus of their technological
activities. Figure 1 shows the rapid technological
evolution in the industry over the years, within and
across diameters. The diameter-specific curves represent the highest density drive produced in the
industry within each diameter in a given year and
thus the technology frontier specific to the particular diameter. The highest-areal-density curve represents the highest-density drive produced in the
industry in a particular year across all diameters.
Both 14-inch and 8-inch diameters experienced a
withdrawal from the market during this period.
The dominance of newer diameters over time is
evidenced by the fact that the highest areal density
of the 14-inch drive was overshadowed by that of
the 5.25-inch drive in 1987, which in turn was
overtaken by the 3.5-inch in 1988, and the 2.5-inch
in 1997.
Types of Entrants into the Disk Drive Industry
In response to profit opportunities from such
rapid technological dynamism and market growth,
substantial market entry occurred for the first ten
years of the period studied, followed by an industry
shake-out in 1986. In addition to 39 incumbents
that entered between 1973 and 1976, there were
153 new entrants after 1977. Under the general
definitions from Helfat and Lieberman (2002), entrants into the disk drive industry can be grouped
into four categories. Spin-outs, the first group of
entrants, represent an important mechanism of
knowledge diffusion and technology transfer in
this industry. We defined a spin-out as a firm
started by individuals who were employees of existing firms in the industry (incumbent firms) in the
year prior to the spin-outs’ formation. Of the entrants in the period studied, 40 (25%) were spinouts. Checks ensured that there were no formal
connections between the parents and the spin-outs.
The mean number of ex-employee founders per
spin-out was 2.47 (s.d. ⫽ 1.5), indicating that, on
average, groups of ex-employees founded spinouts. The founders of the spin-outs were all senior-

level employees of the parent firms with several
years of industry experience. Seventy-two percent
of the founders were either research engineers or in
production operations, with the rest either in marketing or finance. Further, each spin-out had at
least one founder who had engineering or operational experience.
Incumbent-backed entrants, the second entrant
group, were affiliated with incumbent firms in the
disk-drive industry and included subsidiaries, parent-sponsored ventures, and joint ventures. Diversifying entrants, the third entrant group, were firms
that existed in some other industry prior to entering
the disk drive industry. The final group, which was
our control group, consisted of non-spin-out de
novo entrants. These firms were ascertained to
have no direct connection to the industry and were
not diversifying entrants.

Construct Measurement
Spin-out generation. This dummy variable took
the value of 1 if a spin-out was created in the year
following a given year by an employee or employees of a firm founding a new venture, and 0 other-

wise. It served as the dependent variable for testing
Hypothesis 1.
Technological know-how. We measured a firm’s
technological know-how in terms of areal density
using the following two-step procedure. We first
divided the areal density (A) of the best drive produced by firm i of diameter j in year t by the highest
areal density in that diameter available in the market that year to obtain the firm’s diameter-specific
relative technological position (TKijt):

TK ijt ⫽

We then averaged the results on this measure
across all diameters (j ⫽ 1 to n) produced by the
firm in a year to obtain the firm’s average relative
technological know-how (TKit) in that year:

time, since it was a relative time-varying measure
that reflected a firm’s competitive positioning on
technology. We focused on average relative technological know-how across all drives, rather than the
relative position of a firm as represented by its best
drive, because a firm typically competed in more
than one diameter with the other firms in the market, and we were interested in capturing its technological know-how across its product lines. Thus,
a firm at the frontier in all the diameters it produced would have a value for technological knowhow equal to 1, and a firm that was behind the
frontier in any one diameter would score less than
1. Our measure was conservative in that firms that
produced only older diameters would benefit from
other firms dropping these older diameters, while
firms that produced a wider range of diameters
would tend to score lower on their technological
know-how because of higher competition in the
newer diameters. This variable served as an explanatory variable for tests of Hypotheses 1 and 4 and as
a dependent variable for Hypotheses 2 and 3. Further, technological know-how of the parent in the
year preceding a spin-out’s entry into the industry
was an explanatory variable for Hypothesis 2.
Market pioneering know-how. The five new diameter introductions created new submarkets, and
we used these architectural innovations as the basis
of our market pioneering know-how measure. The
market pioneering know-how variable captured the
know-how associated with bringing an innovation
to market. Doing so requires undertaking new market orientation strategies, such as scouting opportunities, assessing uncertainty, and ramping up for
production. Even though only one firm can be considered the true pioneer for a given product on the
basis of order of entry (Golder & Tellis, 1993), more
than one firm may simultaneously engage in market pioneering activities and experience similar
time lines. Since our focus was identifying market
pioneering know-how, not just a single market
pioneer, we included all firms that entered in the
first year of a market segment’s introduction in our
measurement. Robustness checks indicated that the
results did not change when order of entry rather
than year of entry was used as the criterion for firm
inclusion. Our measure recognized the multiple
market pioneering opportunities represented by the
creation of submarkets, as opposed to only the opportunity of introducing the first submarket (that is,
the 14-inch-diameter drive). As a result, our measure varied over time and across firms. We measured market pioneering know-how as the number
of times a firm introduced drives of new diameters
within the first year of their introduction into the
industry divided by the total number of new diam-

where Ei is the year of entry of the ith firm, t is the

that indicates whether the firm was an early mover
when a new diameter was introduced (Pik ⫽ 1 if a
firm introduced a drive of a new diameter within
the first year of the diameter’s introduction into the
industry and 0 otherwise), and Dk is a dummy
variable that indicates whether there was a diameter introduction during that year (Dk ⫽ 1 if a diameter was introduced and 0 otherwise). For each firm
operating in the market at the time of a new diameter’s introduction, the denominator of the variable
increased by 1, and the numerator increased by 1
only if the firm was an early mover for that diameter.3 For firms that entered between two consecutive diameter introductions, the market pioneering
know-how variable took the value of 0 until the
year of the next diameter introduction. Treating the
variable as missing for these firm-years did not
change the results. In keeping with most of the
work on first-mover advantages, we assumed no
depreciation of market pioneering know-how.4

3

For example, consider a hypothetical firm X that
entered the industry in 1979 producing an 8-inch drive,
started production of the 5.25-inch drive in 1981 and of
the 3.75-inch drive in 1983, and exited in 1987. Since
1979 was the first year that the 8-inch drive was produced, and firm X was an early mover in that diameter,
its market pioneering know-how variable value in 1979 is
1. In 1980, the first year in which the 5.25-inch drive was
produced, the firm did not enter the submarket. Thus, the
variable value for firm X is updated to become 0.5. This
value remains unchanged until 1983, the year of the next
diameter’s introduction. Since firm X was an early mover
in the 3.75-inch drive, the variable value is updated to
0.67 and remains unchanged until the firm exits in 1987,
as the next diameter introduction occurred in 1988.
4
Although this measurement was the most intuitively
appealing, we experimented with alternative measures
that included the absolute number of times a firm could
be considered an early mover, the negative of the number
and proportion of missed pioneering opportunities (the

<-----Page 10----->2004

This variable served as an explanatory variable for
testing Hypotheses 1 and 4 and as a dependent
variable for Hypotheses 2 and 3. Further, the market pioneering know-how of a parent in the year
preceding a spin-out’s entry into the industry was
an explanatory variable for Hypothesis 2.
Entrant survival. The dependent variable for Hypothesis 4 was computed as a dummy variable with
a value of 1 if a firm survived to the year following
an observation (with acquisitions being treated as
censored observations) and a value of 0 otherwise.
Spin-out. This explanatory variable for Hypotheses 3 and 4 was coded 1 if at least one founder of
a firm was an ex-employee of an incumbent firm in
the year prior to its formation and 0 otherwise.
Incumbent-backed entrant. This explanatory
variable for Hypotheses 3 and 4 was coded 1 if a
firm was affiliated (was a subsidiary or joint venture, or parent-backed) with an incumbent in the
disk drive industry and 0 otherwise.
Diversifying entrant. This explanatory variable
for Hypotheses 3 and 4 was coded 1 if a firm existed
in some other industry prior to entering the disk
drive industry and 0 otherwise.
Control variables. Firm-level control variables
included measures for sales, growth, age, and country of origin. The logged value of all annual disk
drive sales in millions of dollars, measured firm
sales, and firm growth was the percent change in
sales over successive years. Firm age was the number of years since entry into the disk drive industry,
and we used a quadratic term to incorporate potential nonlinear effects of age. Since foreign firms
may differ from U.S. firms for institutional reasons,
we used a dummy variable, foreign entrant, coded
1 for non-U.S. origin and 0 otherwise. Note that
since only one foreign firm generated a spin-out,
this variable was not included in testing Hypotheses 1 and 2, which pertain to spin-out formation/
inheritance from parents. Further, to control for the
potentially negative effect on a spin-out’s performance of parent presence in the same market segment, we included a dummy variable coded 1 if a
parent was present in the diameter in which the
spin-out first entered and 0 otherwise. Similarly,
we included firm diversity, measured as the difference between the number of diameters produced by
a firm and the average number of diameters produced by all firms in a given year to control for the

number of times that the firm did not pioneer a diameter,
divided by the number of new diameter introductions
since year of firm entry), and an ordinal rank measure of
market pioneering. All these variables yielded similar
substantive results.

effects of diversity and scope of operations relative
to the mean diversity and scope of operations in the
industry. Finally, to control for any systematic effect of entry prior to the period under investigation,
we included firm incumbent in 1976, coded 1 if a
firm had entered the industry prior to 1977.
Industry-level controls included a measure of
the technological frontier in a particular year, the
highest areal density in industry (information per
square inch) of a drive across all the diameters
produced in a given year. Additional industry
control variables were annual industry sales and
industry growth, measured in a similar manner as
firm sales and growth, number of firms, and number of entrants. These variables controlled for
important industry evolution and competitive
density effects (Brittain & Freeman, 1980). Finally, year dummies for the entry year of a firm
were included to control for differences in founding conditions.
Estimation
Hypothesis 1 relates to the probability of a firm’s
generating a spin-out in a given year. We used all
firm-year observations in the sample, since every
firm was a potential parent in any given year. Of the
several models available for analyzing such phenomena, we chose a hazard rate methodology to
account for the fact that each firm was represented
more than once in a data structure that included
firm-year as a unit of observation. Since our Hypothesis 1 dependent variable could also be measured as a count of spin-outs generated, we also
tested the hypotheses using random-effects Poisson
and negative binomial models, and the results were
robust to these alternative model specifications.
Several discrete and continuous time models were
available for the estimation of hazard rates (Allison,
1995); following earlier studies (Henderson, 1999),
we used a multiple-spells formulation with a
complementary log-log specification. Since a firm
could generate a spin-out at any point within a
given year but the data on spin-out generation were
updated only annually, a multiple-spells formulation allowed us to recover continuous-time hazard
rates from discrete-time data. Also, such a specification allowed easier incorporation of time-varying
covariates. Our results were robust to alternative
hazard rate estimation techniques, including Cox
proportional hazard and piecewise exponential
models.
Hypothesis 2, pertaining to spin-outs’ knowledge, was tested by restricting the sample to firmyear observations for spin-outs only. Since our operational definition of a spin-out required founding

<-----Page 11----->512

Academy of Management Journal

within one year of the founder leaving the parent
organization, we were able to use the parent’s technological and market pioneering know-how in the
year prior to the spin-out’s entry in the hypotheses
testing the inheritance of knowledge. The chief independent variables of interest—parent technological and market pioneering know-how—were timeinvariant, and the analyses tested their effect on the
spin-out’s technological know-how and market pioneering know-how over the spin-out’s life span to
check for long-term effects. To control for the effect
of time, we included both entry-year dummies and
spin-out age in the model. We tested the Hypothesis 3 prediction of differences between spin-out
and non-spin-out entrants’ know-how by including
the firm-year observations of all entering firms.
This restriction caused us to exclude firms that
entered prior to 1976 for these models. For both
Hypotheses 2 and 3, we used seemingly unrelated
regression models (SUR) to account for potential
correlations of the errors across the technological
and market pioneering know-how equations. Owing to the complexity of the error variance-covariance matrix when both cross-equation and autocorrelation constraints are introduced, existing
commercial software packages do not accommodate panel-based SUR models, the ideal model
given the nature of our data. In the absence of such
methods, we tested the hypotheses using both
random-effects panel regression and SUR models
separately, and the results were largely similar. We
report the SUR results, which we believe are more
appropriate since SUR allows for (1) separate variances and (2) contemporaneous correlation of the
error terms of each equation, in contrast to panel
models that assume homogeneous distribution of
the error terms for various cross-sections, thus leading to more efficient estimates (Mckenzie & Thompson, 1997). Finally, to test for differences between
spin-out and non-spin-out entrant survival (Hypothesis 4), we restricted the sample to all entrants
again, and used hazard rate methodology for the
analysis of survival probabilities. As before, we
estimated additional model specifications to ensure robustness and found the results to be substantively similar across different models.

nological know-how and market pioneering knowhow was constructed by multiplying the two “main
effects,” there was a possibility that multicollinearity might confound the test of the simple effects by
inflating the standard errors. Our analysis revealed
that the effects of market pioneering know-how and
technological know-how were significant in the presence of the interaction and that the standard errors
were reasonable. Also, a comparison of the coefficients of models 1 and 2 in Table 2 revealed that all
coefficients were stable across the two models.
We now turn to the testing of our hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 relates incumbent firm know-how to
spin-out generation. Accordingly, the observations
pertained to a firm’s being a potential parent in
every single year after its entry, or after 1976 for
firms that entered prior to this date. The results of
the test of Hypothesis 1 are shown in Table 2. In
model 1, the main effects of technological knowhow and market pioneering know-how on spin-out
generation, along with control variables, were entered. In model 2, we entered and estimated the
multiplicative interaction of the two know-how
variables.
Results from both models show that the probability of generating a spin-out in a following period
was positively related to the main effects of technological know-how and market pioneering knowhow of an incumbent in the previous year. Model 2
shows that the interaction between the two types of
know-how had a negative impact on the probability
of generating a spin-out. Taken together, models 1
and 2 imply that while increases in either technological or market pioneering know-how increased
the likelihood of generating spin-outs, increases in
both know-how dimensions were less likely to generate spin-outs, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1.5
Table 3 presents test results for Hypothesis 2,
which relates a spin-out’s know-how levels over its
lifetime to the know-how levels of the parent firm
in the year prior to the spin-out’s formation. Using
firm-year observations pertaining to the spin-outs,
models 1 (technological know-how) and 2 (market
pioneering know-how) report results related to the
impact of parents’ know-how on the know-how of

RESULTS
Descriptive statistics and correlations on the
variables included in the analysis are presented in
Table 1. An examination of the bivariate correlations in Table 1 reveals that multicollinearity was
not a major issue. We computed variance inflation
factors and found no evidence of severe collinearity. Since the term for the interaction between tech-

August

We also conducted additional analysis using the
absolute difference between technological and market
pioneering know-how. The coefficient of this term was
positive and significant, indicating that the higher the
gap between technological and market pioneering knowhow, the greater the likelihood of spin-out generation.
This finding provided additional support for Hypothesis
1, since firms that had higher values of either technological or market pioneering know-how, but not both, were
more likely to generate spin-outs.

their spin-outs. Results show that the parent’s technological and market pioneering know-how measured in the year preceding spin-out entry are
strongly significant in predicting a spin-out’s technological and market pioneering know-how, respectively, thereby supporting Hypothesis 2.
Table 4 reports the results for Hypothesis 3 using
all firm-year observations for the post-1977 entrants into the industry. Models 1 and 2 report the
variation among the three types of entrants—spinouts, incumbent-backed entrants, and diversifying
entrants— on technological and market pioneering
know-how, respectively. Non-spin-out de novo entrants were the control group. The results for model
1 show that both spin-outs and incumbent-backed
entrants had higher technological know-how than
the control group. The coefficient of diversifying
entrants was negative and significant, indicating
that the technological know-how of diversifying
entrants was lower than the control group’s. Model
2 reveals that spin-outs had higher levels of market
pioneering know-how than the control group. The

August

coefficient of incumbent-backed entrants was not
significant, but the coefficient of diversifying entrants was once again negative and significant. Together, these results indicate that spin-out firms
have higher know-how levels than both diversifying entrants and non-spin-out de novo entrants,
thereby supporting Hypothesis 3.6
Table 5 reports the results from the hazard rate
analysis. It shows that spin-outs had a higher probability of survival than all other types of entrants,
thereby supporting Hypothesis 4.7 Higher technological know-how also increased the probability of
survival, but market pioneering know-how did not
appear to affect the probability of survival.
DISCUSSION
Research suggests that the origins of new firms
may explain heterogeneity in their capabilities and
performance. Explanations of where new entrants
come from and how they acquire their initial stocks
of knowledge are thus issues central to organization
scholars. In this context, although it has been noted
that preentry experience and founders’ prior employment affiliations fashion a de novo’s resources
and capabilities, scholars’ theoretical and empirical understanding is limited. The gap is especially
pronounced for spin-outs, or entrepreneurial ventures founded by former employees of incumbent
firms. Spin-outs, which are a particularly innovative and powerful form of new entrant, have been
eulogized as “paragons of innovation” as well as
criticized for being “rapacious plunderers” of their
parent’s innovations (Klepper, 2001). However, despite anecdotal evidence and some preliminary research, there seems to have been little scientific
investigation of their formation, knowledge inheritance, and performance. In this research, we
adopted a knowledge perspective and studied how
the technological and market pioneering knowhow of an incumbent influenced spin-out formation (Hypothesis 1), how parental know-how at the
time of spin-out formation affected spin-out knowledge level (Hypothesis 2), and whether spin-outs
differed from other entrants in their knowledge levels (Hypothesis 3) and survival chances (Hypothesis 4).

6

There were 40 spin-outs based on our definition, but
6 additional firms were started by former employees
more than one year after leaving incumbent firms. The
results were robust to tests that included these firms.
7
As before, the results were robust to sensitivity tests
for inclusion of firms founded by employees more than a
year after leaving incumbents.

With respect to the hypothesis on spin-out generation, the results of this research suggest that
organizations with abundant, but underexploited,
knowledge are especially fertile grounds for spinout formation. An imbalance in an organization’s
focus on value creation and value appropriation
increases its likelihood of generating spin-outs. Anecdotal evidence from Christensen (1997) showed
that Conner Peripherals was founded by disaffected
employees of Seagate and Miniscribe, the two largest 5.25-inch disc drive manufacturers, who had
developed the 3.5-inch drive but had decided
against marketing it. Similarly, the founders of Micropolis, an early mover in production of the 8-inch
drive, came from Pertec, a 14-inch drive manufacturer. Incumbent firms, however, appear to have
retained their employees by proactively investing
in both technological and market pioneering knowhow. For example, Quantum and Control Data created subsidiaries that targeted emerging segments
to prevent spin-out formation. Another case in
point is Micropolis, itself a spin-out and an early
mover, which successfully made the transition to a
new platform by managing the change from within
the existing organization, and succeeding in retaining its employees. This evidence supports the idea
that it is not abundance of knowledge per se, but its

August

utilization, that determines spin-out generation. An
implication is that rather than resigning themselves
to the notion that knowledge is a double-edged
sword that results in competition from within,
managers can orient their strategies toward simultaneous value creation and appropriation, and thus
limit competition. Our findings also indicate that
though size is positively associated with spin-out
formation, a potential parent’s presence in a large
number of market segments lowers chances of spinout formation. The nonsignificant effect of age indicates that spin-out generation was not related to
firm age.
In support of the notion that knowledge may be
inherited, we found that parental knowledge levels
at the time of spin-out formation positively affected
spin-outs’ knowledge levels. For instance, all but
one of the new diameters were introduced by spinouts, even though the technology had been developed by an incumbent. Also, progenies of parents
with high knowledge levels appear to have higher
knowledge levels, not only with respect to the progenies of parents with lower knowledge levels, but
also with respect to their own parents. Only 4 of the
40 spin-outs had lower technical know-how measures than their parents at the time of inception.
Thirty-three percent of spin-outs whose parents
were market pioneers were market pioneers themselves, while non-market-pioneering parents resulted in only 6.8 percent of spin-outs that were
market pioneers. Further, our results support the
notion that direct links to industry knowledge
through founders better facilitates the integration of
this knowledge than grafting knowledge through
hiring employees with industry experience. Given
that incumbent-backed ventures have similar direct
access to knowledge, we did not formally hypothesize any advantage in knowledge capabilities for
spin-outs with respect to this group. The results are
mixed on the two dimensions of knowledge capabilities. Although incumbent-backed ventures, like
spin-outs, have higher levels of technological
know-how, they do not have similarly higher levels
of market pioneering know-how. In terms of a key
performance dimension, we found that spin-outs
survived at a higher rate than any other form for
entrant into the industry, thus supporting our notion that their entrepreneurial form and origin from
incumbents endow spin-outs with greater motivation and capabilities. It is interesting to note, in this
context, the inability of incumbent-backed ventures to either gain market pioneering know-how,
or more importantly, have better survival chances.
These findings seem to indicate that incumbentbacked ventures may be subject to certain disadvantages stemming from initial or continued paren-

<-----Page 16----->2004

tal involvement. This suggestion further highlights
the importance of entrepreneurial flexibility. Finally, while not a hypothesized relationship, the
insignificance of market pioneering in explaining
survival suggests that by itself, pioneering may not
sustain longevity. This notion is consistent with
the research on first and early mover advantages,
which has indicated that although early entrants
may have higher returns (that is, market share),
they may not necessarily experience higher survival rates than later followers because of the
greater technological and market uncertainty that
characterize new markets (e.g., Lieberman & Montgomery, 1998; Mitchell, 1991; Shepherd, 1999).
Theoretical Contributions
As Klepper (2001) noted, theorizing on high-tech
spin-outs is in its infancy. This study used a knowledge-based approach to integrate ideas on knowhow inheritance and employee entrepreneurship to
construct theory on spin-out formation and development. In the process of enhancing understanding
of these entrepreneurial change agents, we advance
the knowledge-based view of the firm. Although
extant work has indicated that spin-outs may be
triggered by organizational crisis, change in leadership, or lack of upward mobility for employees
(Brittain & Freeman, 1986; Garvin, 1983), fundamentally researchers know little about why some
incumbents tend to become “entrepreneurial hotbeds” (Burton et al., 2002). By providing evidence
of the systematic links between human capital,
knowledge-based capabilities, and spin-out formation, our research redirects attention to the knowledge-based view of the firm as a potentially fruitful
theoretical lens through which to study this very
important phenomenon. We have also addressed
an important dichotomy in the knowledge-based
view of the firm between exploratory, knowledgegenerating activities that increase the stock of
knowledge, and exploitation activities concerned
with knowledge application (Spender, 1992).
Reconciling the dichotomy between knowledgecreating and knowledge-applying activities represents a key challenge of considerable difficulty for
the institutions of production (Grant, 1996). Such
complex interdependencies between different types
of knowledge have been noted, but our study went
further by modeling and finding potentially adverse consequences of knowledge when organizations fail to resolve this duality. Emphasis on only
one domain of knowledge results in pockets of
underexploited knowledge, which leads to knowledge spillovers through employee entrepreneurship. This means not only a failure to appropriate

517

the full value of R&D and business process investments for a firm, but also an undesirable increase in
competition.
Second, we contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the identity of the fields of entrepreneurship and strategic management.8 Scholars have argued that the distinction lies in entrepreneurship’s
focus on value creation and strategic management’s
emphasis on value appropriation (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Zahra & Dess, 2001). Integrating
these two views of wealth creation, Hitt, Ireland,
Camp, and Sexton (2001) advanced the notion of
“strategic entrepreneurship.” Our arguments and
subsequent finding that firms need to accomplish a
syncretic balance between value creation and appropriation supports this general idea. Thus, an
important implication of our study is the need to
view strategic entrepreneurship through dual
lenses of value creation and appropriation.
Third, although organizational learning scholars
have speculated about knowledge inheritance, we
provide hard evidence that genealogical knowledge
links do exist between parent and progeny organizations. Our study thus may be among the first
to empirically substantiate the phenomenon of
knowledge inheritance. Further, our finding that
knowledge transfers more effectively through
founders than through employees indicates that the
agent of knowledge transfer is an important determinant of its efficacy.
Fourth, we add to the growing literature on entrepreneurship relating to initial endowments. In
addition to social capital, employee entrepreneurs
also benefit from the knowledge they acquire while
working with incumbent firms. Entrepreneurship
theories thus need to address how apprenticeships
with leading incumbent firms may impact entrepreneurial capital. Finally, our findings provide
evidence of the advantages conferred by the dual
presence of entrepreneurial flexibility and preentry experience on new ventures. Existing studies
have typically compared diversifying and de novo
entrants and argued that incumbency and the
ability to transfer and leverage knowledge across
various business units of a firm (Teece & Pisano,
1994) bestows de alio entrants with “dominance
by birthright” (Carroll et al., 1996; Klepper &
Simons, 2000). Very few advantages that enable de
novo entrants to compete successfully have been
identified, other than their flexibility (Tushman &
Anderson, 1986). By distinguishing between four
types of entrants and comparing spin-outs with

8

<-----Page 17----->518

other de novo entrants, diversifying entrants, and
incumbent-backed entrants (Helfat & Lieberman,
2002), our findings indicate that spin-out de novo
firms benefit not only from the advantage of entrepreneurial origin, but also from inherited knowledge.
Limitations and Future Research
Our study’s limitations also provide exciting areas for future research. First, care should be taken
about overgeneralizing the findings from a single
industry, and future research could investigate the
extent to which our framework holds in other industries. Second, our measure of firm size relied on
disk drive sales rather than number of employees.9
Previous research has indicated that these alternative measures of firm size are highly correlated and
thereby will yield similar results (Chandy & Tellis,
2000), and tests on our subsample of all publicly
traded disk drive firms bore out this fact. However,
our use of sales rather than employees is a limitation of our study, given its focus on human capital
and entrepreneurial motives. Third, we found that
though some firms specialized in advancing either
scientific or marketing knowledge, others did both,
thus raising issues regarding knowledge development processes and decisions that lead firms on
various knowledge paths. Future work may need to
explore whether the organization of capabilities
may be as important a source of performance heterogeneity as the capabilities themselves. In other
words, rather than keeping a singular focus on
knowledge quantity, research may benefit by investigating knowledge portfolios (Leiponen, 2003).
Fourth, although we established a relationship between parental and progeny knowledge, we were
unable to unravel endowment and learning effects
and learn whether spin-outs learn faster and better
than other entrants, or whether non-spin-out entrants can ever catch up. This question is important
given that over time, a firm may lose its technological lead, even though it may have entered with
cutting-edge knowledge (Bahk & Gort, 1993). Moreover, diminishing returns to learning may imply
that the higher the stock of know-how, the lower
the rate of subsequent learning. Firms with low
stocks of know-how may be able to learn quickly if
they can build on superior knowledge outside their
boundaries, but firms with high stocks of knowledge may make slow progress if they face the

harder task of creating new knowledge as the basis
of their learning. These confounding effects make it
difficult to make assertions about the effects of the
presence (or absence) of learning.
Fifth, our data precluded a finer-grained analysis
of founders. There are exciting questions related to
founder characteristics, and founders’ specific experiences as employees, that may shape the new
ventures they form. Even though all the founders of
the spin-outs in the sample had held high positions
in research, manufacturing, or marketing at the
incumbent firms, they otherwise varied. Future
research needs to address how variations in expertise, hierarchical position, and management
team characteristics influence the effectiveness of
knowledge transfer and whether there are network
effects at play in the formation of founder teams.
Despite our ensuring that there were no formal ties
between parents and progeny, we could not ascertain the absence or presence of informal ties. Sixth,
data limitations necessitated pooling several different forms of incumbent-backed entrants. Therefore,
care must be taken in the interpretation of the results related to incumbent-backed ventures. It
would be particularly important for future research
to identify incumbent-backed ventures created to
encourage “intrapreneurship” and deter spin-out
formation and gauge their performance consequences. Finally, although the assumption in survival studies is that survival and good economic
performance are equivalent, there is evidence that,
due to varying performance thresholds, some underperforming firms persist, whereas proactive exit
can occur without economic dissolution (Gimeno,
Folta, Cooper, & Woo, 1997). Our study therefore
suffers from a limitation that is endemic to most
survival studies. Future research needs to investigate variables such as market share and financial
performance.
CONCLUSION
Our research addresses an important phenomenon—the rise of the spin-out as a particular type
of entrepreneurial entrant in high-technology,
innovation-oriented industries. The broad research
questions in our work set foundations for a research
agenda on spin-outs. Our findings regarding formation suggest that it is not merely abundant incumbent knowledge per se, but its utilization, that has
implications for spin-out generation, thus suggesting that firms need to strategically invest their resources in simultaneous value creation and appropriation capabilities, rather than specialize to the
detriment of a complementary capability. From a
spin-out perspective, it appears that knowledge cor-

<-----Page 18----->2004

Agarwal, Echambadi, Franco, and Sarkar

ridors prior to formation are critical. Knowledge is in
fact inherited, and a firm’s founder is a potentially
more effective agent of transfer than a hired employee. Finally, it appears that spin-outs have a survival edge in the market over other entrants as the
result of a combination of entrepreneurial flexibility
and inherited knowledge. While the jury is still out
on whether spin-outs are rapacious plunderers or
paragons of innovation, we hope this research will
trigger further research on related issues.
