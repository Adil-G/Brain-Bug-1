The procurement of capital is an important consideration for an entity transforming
from an entrepreneurial idea to a revenue generating company.
Angel financing is one of the most common, but least studied methods, to finance new
ventures.
The term “Angel Investor” generally refers to a high net-worth individual who typically
invests in small, private firms on his or her own account.
Using a unique dataset of firms financed by angels between 1994 and 2001, our research
provides some insight into the role of angels in funding, monitoring and guiding their
investments.
Although exposed to greater uncertainty by investing earlier in the life of a firm compared to venture capital investors, angel investors do not rely on traditional control
mechanisms such as board control, staging, or contractual provisions to protect against
expropriation.
Angels may use more informal methods of control such as investing in close geographic
proximity and syndicating investments with other angels to mitigate risks.
The results of the study indicate that angels have a complementary role to venture
capital in the financing of new ventures.

One of the most important considerations a new
entity faces in the transformation from an entrepreneurial idea to a revenue-generating company
is the procurement of capital. Institutional
venture capital has long been glamorized in the
press and academic research as the primary
source of outside equity financing for these entities. However, many studies estimate that institutional venture capital contributes less than half
of the total equity financing for new firms. The
less-scrutinized, yet equally important, source of

start-up capital is the informal venture capital
market known as angel financing.
Originally used to describe financers of theatrical productions, today the term ‘angel investor’ refers to an affluent individual who provides
equity capital for a business start-up. Typically,
angel investors fill the financing gap between
funding from family and friends and funding
from institutional venture capital firms. Angels
exist primarily because it is typically difficult
for friends and family to contribute more than
a few thousand dollars, and institutional venture
capital firms will rarely consider smaller deals.
Bank loans are often not a viable option for
these start-ups because of the lack of collateral
and/or interest payback requirements.
. . . [W]e raised a million dollars and I had
to talk to about 60 different people. These
were angel investors. Venture capitalists
were totally uninterested . . . So, with a lot
of hard work we raised that million dollars
from about 20 different angel investors
who invested about $50,000 each, and
that was the original money that really
funded Amazon.com. (Jeff Bezos, Founder,
Amazon, Inc.3)
While it is difficult to precisely quantify the
size of the angel market due to its informal
nature, many studies estimate its size as at least
twice that of the institutional venture capital
market. In a 1992 study, Freear et al. suggest
that angels fund more than ten times the
number of firms as venture capitalists. In 2000,
the National Venture Capital Association
assessed the size of the angel market at $100
billion in the United States while the institutional venture capital market was estimated at
less than half this at $48.3 billion.4 In 2002,
the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
assessed the size of the angel market at five
times the institutional venture capital market.5

from several different surveys conducted
between 2001 and 2003. He finds between
140,000 and 266,000 angels commit between
$12.7 and $36 billion to between 50,000 and
57,000 companies annually.
Angel financing’s importance in funding
new businesses raises several questions. Who
are these investors and what kinds of businesses do they invest in? Do angels operate in
the same manner as institutional venture
capital firms? If not, how do angels maintain control over their investments? More generally, why do two types of equity-based
start-up financing exist? Do angels provide
more than just financial assistance? This article
provides some insight into the role of angels
in funding, monitoring, and guiding their
investments.

Who are angel investors?
While there are many definitions of angel
investors, the term generally refers to high-networth individuals who typically invest in small,
private firms on their own account. Formally,
angel investors are ‘accredited investors’
according to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC Rule 501 of
Regulation D states that an accredited investor
is an individual who has a net worth of more
than $1 million or an expected individual
(household) yearly income of more than
$200,000 ($300,000). However, many angels
may not be accredited — according to a 2008
study by Shane, accredited investors account
for only 23% of the total angel population.
While the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances estimates that over 6 million
households qualify to be accredited investors,
many studies estimate the number of active
angel investors in the United States to be
between 250,000 and 400,000.6
Angels invest their own money in firms. This
criterion differentiates angels from institutional
venture capitalists, who raise money from
others that they invest in private firms.

Angel finance

According to a paper by Linde and Prasad
(1999), the average angel has a total of $335,000
invested in four different companies. Shane
(2008) finds that 20.8% of angels made only
one angel investment in their careers.
As individual investors, angels exhibit great
heterogeneity in personal characteristics such
as age, experience, and investment preferences. Many angels are cashed-out entrepreneurs who continue to yearn for the next
high-growth venture. Other angels are simply
wealthy local businessmen such as doctors or
lawyers. Because angels have to perform their
own due diligence, they typically invest in
ventures in industries familiar to them. In addition to making a financial investment, some
angels actively participate in the firm’s operations; however, such participation varies by
angel. Some angels are passive.
The funding process and contractual terms
also vary widely between formal and organized
angels and those with a more informal
approach. Angel investment can involve anything from a complete proposal to an individual handing over a check on a front porch.
In 1998, Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the
co-founders of Sun Microsystems, wrote
a check for $100,000 to two students after
they had showed him their search engine
software. The students’ names were Sergey
Brin and Larry Page. Their software was
Google. The check was made out to a
company that didn’t even exist, ‘Google
Inc.’ Before they could deposit the check,
Brin and Page needed to incorporate and
open a checking account.7

Herringtown and Localbusiness.com). Firms
were asked if they had received any outside
funding. Angel-backed firms were contacted
for information regarding all financing received

and background information on the founders.
Due to issues of confidentiality and competition, some respondents only provided partial

content and design firms, and business-tobusiness/consumer companies. Not surprisingly, companies in California are the largest
recipients of angel financing, consistent with
venture capital research.
A majority of the angel-backed firms receive
angel financing pre-revenue. A pre-revenue
firm is a business that has not derived any
revenue from its product. If revenue streams
are an indicator of development, angel-backed
firms receive financing earlier in the lifecycle
than the typical venture-capital-financed firm
that tends to have sales. Similarly, angel-backed
firms are younger at first funding (in months
since founding) than venture-capital-financed
firms. Taken together, this indicates that angels
are willing to finance firms with greater uncertainty about the prospects of success than
venture capitalists.
Several other factors support the idea that
angels and venture capitalists are different
types of investors. Angels and venture capitalists are co-investors in less than a quarter of all
funding rounds. On average for companies
at comparable stages, the amount of money
a company raises from venture capitalists is
twice the amount provided by ‘angel-only’
financing rounds. These differences in funding
suggest that angels play a complementary role
to venture capital. Instead of competing with
venture capitalists for firms at similar stages of
development, angels provide a smaller amount
of funding to younger firms.
Total funding amounts by type of round
($ millions)

face a high risk of expropriation. Investors
usually seek to protect their investment from
expropriation through the use of control
rights — the methods accorded to investors to
allow them to oversee the entrepreneur’s
management of a company’s affairs. Three
control mechanisms commonly used by
venture capitalists are board rights, staging
investments, and contracting mechanisms. If
angels are similar to venture capitalists, they
should maintain similar protections, particularly in ventures where the threat of expropriation is the highest.

Board rights
Board seats give outside investors the ability
to affect corporate decisions. Board rights are
particularly important in environments with
greater uncertainty, since it is not feasible to
specify all possible contingencies in the
ex ante contract. Sahlman (1990) finds board
seats are typically allocated to venture capitalists as part of a financing round. This is not the
case with angel investments. Board seats are
granted in less than half of all funding rounds.
The likelihood of providing a board seat does
not change much when considering pre- and
post-revenue funding rounds. Initial rounds of
angel financing tend to have a slightly higher
(though not statistically significant) probability of board seat allocation, although fewer
than half of all first rounds relinquish board
seats to outside investors.

directors in a typical angel-financed investment round, while 1.1 seats are added in a
typical venture capital round.8 In addition to
being smaller, the boards of directors of angelbacked firms tend to be dominated by insiders.
Insiders had a majority in over 80% of the
boards in the sample of angel-backed firms.
However, in venture-capital-funded firms,
insiders comprise the majority in only 13.9%
of the boards. Angels tend to take a much
smaller degree of control through board
representation than venture capital firms.
The results on boards of directors are consistent with other theories which suggest a
passive role for angels. Fama and Jensen (1983)
hypothesize that the composition of the board
should be shaped by the need for monitoring.
If the threat of managerial expropriation is
high, then the board will bear a greater responsibility for oversight. At the early age of the
firm, much of the venture’s value is embodied
in the human capital of the entrepreneurs;
therefore, the replacement of the founders
would not seem to increase the value of the
company.
Staging
Empirical and theoretical works have emphasized the importance of staging as a control
mechanism for venture capitalists. Instead of
providing the entirety of capital in a lump
sum, the investment is allocated by stages,
preserving the investor’s option to abandon.
Theoretical models such as Hart and Moore
(1994), Bergemann and Hege (1998), and
Neher (1999) stress the importance of staging
as a control mechanism. Gompers (1995) finds
that venture capitalists use staging as an
important method to control agency costs.
We find that consecutive rounds funded
entirely by angels tend to have follow-on investors from earlier rounds. However, if the subsequent financing round involves venture
capital participation, angels do not follow on.
This finding supports the complementary

Lerner (1995) finds venture capital financing rounds

nature of angel and venture capital investment. Once the firm has been nurtured to
success, with success defined as venture
capital investment, the angels step aside for
more professional or deep-pocketed investors.
Even when angels do make follow-on investments, only an average of 40% of investors
from previous rounds participate in the subsequent rounds.
Contractual provisions
Angel investors may use contractual provisions as protection from expropriation. More
complex securities may provide investors
stronger protections in the event of liquidation. Contractual clauses may give the investor
additional protection from expropriation.
Common protections in venture contracts
include ratcheting and anti-dilution agreements. Complex securities should be used
when the threat of expropriation is greater.
Firms that have an identifiable revenue stream
and/or an entrepreneur with prior entrepreneurial experience may not need as complex
a security.
Figure 1 reports the types of securities
issued in each round. Common equity is the
most prevalent security issued in 34% of all
rounds. In contrast, convertible preferred is
the dominant security in venture capital financing. The high usage of preferred and common
equity is consistent with the theoretical

predictions of Casamatta (2003). In her model,
Casamatta finds common equity is better suited
to smaller investments (such as those made by
angels), while larger investments should use
preferred or convertible preferred securities.
Equity may be used more often with angel
investments because the higher (legal and
other) costs of writing a complex security with
a small investment outweigh the benefits.
More complex securities were typically
issued in larger funding rounds. The transaction costs from writing a more detailed
contract may be more warranted with larger
investments.
In addition to security choice, many investment contracts have provisions that protect
and empower the investor. Table 1 contains
information on many of these contractual
clauses.
Many contracts contain a follow-on right of
first refusal provision that allows angels to participate in future rounds to capture the potential upside in successful ventures. However,
many angels do not exercise this right. 26% of
financing rounds contain weighted ratchet
clauses for protection against future rounds at
decreased valuations. Full ratcheting protection was not given in any investment round.
In comparison, Kaplan and Strömberg (2003)
find 21.9% of their sample use full ratcheting
and 78.1% of their sample use weighted ratcheting. Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) find contingent equity ownership prevalent in venture
capital contracts. In such contracts, additional
funding is contingent on the firm meeting
observable measures of financial and nonfinancial performance. However, very few

angel contracts contain provisions for contingent equity stakes.
Contractual protection from expropriation
is not one-sided. 38 financing rounds contain
provisions that allow the firm to repurchase
the stake of the angel, similar to the call provisions explained in Sahlman (1990). Many
entrepreneurs cite this clause as a way to rid
themselves of ‘bad apples’ or investors whose
vision does not coincide with that of the
founders.

If angels do not use the methods
used by venture capitalists, how do
they maintain control?
In contrast to the control mechanisms adopted
by venture capitalists, angels do not implement the same methods of managerial oversight. In particular, angels typically do not
receive board seats, stage investments, or use
particularly strong contractual clauses to
protect their claims. Three other factors were
explored to understand how angels mitigate
the increased risk of investing in early stages:
(1) the amount of funding, (2) the use of
syndication, and (3) geographical proximity
between angels and their investments.
Funding
If investors are concerned with large degrees
of uncertainty, then the average contribution
per investor, total funding amounts, and
number of investors will be sensitive to variables that proxy for uncertainty — characteristics of the entrepreneur and management team,
and the presence of a revenue stream. Intangible factors such as an entrepreneur’s prior
experience may provide signals to alleviate
investor uncertainty. Funders may feel more
secure investing with entrepreneurs who have
a previous track record. More mature firms and
larger firms also should have more existing
information about their product and projections, decreasing the uncertainty associated
with an investment. Having a management
team or a revenue stream may indicate to investors that the firm has completed the initial idea
phase and is ready to move forward.
Strategic Change

<-----Page 6----->227

Angel finance

In regressions not reported in this article,
we find high-growth firms received more
funding in each round. Somewhat surprisingly,
post-revenue firms actually received less
funding than pre-revenue funds. No other
measures of uncertainty seemed to strongly
influence the amount of funding.
One reason to explain this is that outside
investors typically own less than a quarter of
the new firm. Despite the higher levels of
inherent uncertainty associated with more
nascent firms, angel investors may not need
high degrees of control because the threat of
expropriation is minimized by the large
residual claim held by the founders. That is,
the incentives of the founders are aligned with
the prospects of the firm. In comparison,
Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) find venture
capitalists hold a larger proportion of cash
flow rights (on average 40%) in the investments that they make. Because the incentives
of the entrepreneur are not as strongly aligned
with the outside investors, the need for formal
control mechanisms may be greater. However,
it is questionable whether such a difference in
ownership drastically increases the need for
formal controls.
We also find that having a management team
in place, an indication that the firm has passed
the initial development stages, decreases the
equity share given to the outsider investors.
Greater research and development intensity
also leads to a decreased stake for angels.

Syndication
Another method of reducing risk is to syndicate investment with other investors. By
syndicating investments, the investors may be
able to share the risks and share in the monitoring of the firm. Additionally, a larger syndicate may indicate that the firm has passed the
evaluation of more screeners. Some angels
may cooperate (or free-ride) on the due diligence of others. Syndication may also act as a
verification mechanism, thus it is expected
that earlier funding rounds will have more
investors.
Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

On average, 12 angels co-invest together in
a round. In comparison, Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) find venture rounds are normally
syndicated with two to nine venture funds coinvesting. While the increase in syndication
may increase the monitoring capacities of the
angel investment group, venture capitalists
also syndicate their investments while maintaining more formal control mechanisms.
Although angels do typically syndicate their
investments with other angels, this does not
answer the question — why do control mechanisms differ between angels and venture
capitalists?
Geographical proximity
Entrepreneurs may begin their search for
capital by exploring local resources. A localized bond of trust may exist between the
entrepreneur and investor, making formal
control mechanisms unnecessary. Being in
close geographical proximity to their investment may mitigate the need for more formal
control mechanisms. Because of the strong
trust and familiarity many local investors may
have with each other, syndication is greater
among local investors. The need for subsequent larger funding amounts may exhaust the
resources of the local investors and require
more professional investors or institutions.
Additionally, as a firm develops, the need for
professionalization (i.e., management skills) is
greater, leading the entrepreneur to turn to
more professional investors who require more
formal control because of their lack of familiarity with the founders.
Angels have one-degree of separation from
people in their professional network — not
two, or three, or four. But because angels
tend to be operational types, the business
relationships they bring to the table are
personal, not transactional. (Rob Convoy,
angel investor)9

Andrew Wong, Mihir Bhatia and Zachary Freeman

In the sample, the average contribution per
angel decreases when the nearest angel is less
than 50 miles away, suggesting that local
investors may not be as wealthy as more
professional investors. However, this is offset
by the increase in the number of angels
who invest if they are located closer to the
entrepreneur.
Local investors provide more help to new
ventures. Entrepreneurs responded that they
were more likely to receive help from angel
investors if the investor resided less than
50 miles from the new enterprise. Considering the background and industry expertise of many of the angel investors, it is
often this non-pecuniary assistance that is
the most beneficial to the start-up. However,
relying on angels in close geographical
proximity may delay subsequent venture
capital investment. A possible explanation
is that local angels do not have as large a
contact network as more professional
investors.
Some additional validation for this idea is
provided by examining the results on the
formal control mechanisms: board seats,
staging, and security choice. In contrast to
Lerner’s (1995) finding that close geographical
proximity increases the likelihood of board
representation,
geographical
proximity,
defined as the investor residing within 50
miles of the venture, has a negative effect on
the probability that a board seat is given in
angel-funded rounds. The need for contractual
monitoring (via a board seat) may be reduced
because of the geographical proximity of
investors. Geographical proximity also
decreases the use of staging and increases the
use of equity, consistent with the localized
investor hypothesis.
Taken together, these results suggest many
entrepreneurs begin their search for capital
with local resources, relying on local ties to
encourage investment. Local angel investors
may not be as sophisticated as more professional investors, but may be more involved in
the venture. They do not rely on formal control
mechanisms; instead, they often participate in
the new venture.
Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Post-investment assistance
There are many ways investors can participate in a new venture. They may work directly
with the entrepreneur to further develop the
idea. They may help secure future financing.
Gorman and Sahlman (1989), Sahlman (1990),
and Ehrlich et al. (1994) find that venture
capitalists actively participate in their investments after funding. In addition to funding,
angel investors can also play an active role in
professionalizing the firm or bringing a
product to market, similar to some of the
activities that venture capitalists provide
(Hellmann and Puri, 2002). Since many angels
are former entrepreneurs or industry executives, they may derive some private benefits
from assisting in the development of a new
firm. Two of the more identifiable ways of
providing help is assistance in procuring a
management team and procuring additional
funds.
Building the management team is an
important step. Complete management teams
typically lead to larger funding amounts
in subsequent rounds. Venture capital firms
routinely help form management teams.
Angels helped form the management team in
less than a quarter of the firms in the data.
Kaplan and Strömberg (2000), in contrast,
find that venture capitalists expect to replace
the CEO or help recruit management in 50%
of their investments. The results from the
data suggest angels provide less assistance
than venture capitalists in forming management teams.
Angels can provide assistance in another
important area, helping to locate and secure
subsequent financing from venture capital.
Gorman and Sahlman (1989) report venture
capitalists consider raising additional funds the
most important activity. We find that more
angel investors leads to a shorter time to
venture financing. This is evidence that angels
can play a networking role; a larger number of
angels leads to a larger network of contacts
and faster venture capital financing. Ibrahim
(2008) also stresses the importance of angel
finance as a precursor to venture capital,
Strategic Change
DOI: 10.1002/jsc

<-----Page 8----->229

suggesting that angels agree to less complex
contract terms to expedite future venture
capital financing.
Not surprisingly, geographical proximity
of the angel is the largest determinant of the
amount of help the angel provides the
founders. Angels who are in closer proximity tend to provide better assistance. Familiarity with issues confronting new ventures
may require more interaction, therefore
geographical proximity may encourage more
assistance.

Conclusion
Angel financing is one of the most commonly
used but least studied methods to finance new
ventures. Using a unique dataset of angelbacked firms, we detail the characteristics of
angels, the firms they invest in, and the
methods they use to control their investments.
Contrasting with an oft-studied method of
financing new ventures (venture capital), we
are able to get a better understanding of angel
finance.
Analysis of the data indicates that angels
have a complementary role to venture capital
in the financing of new ventures. Angels take
on more risks and invest smaller amounts in
younger firms than venture capitalists. Angel
investors appear to nurture younger firms until
the company is established enough for venture
consideration.
Angels are not awarded the same degree of
control rights as typical venture capital investments use. Rather, one of the primary mechanisms to control agency costs is an alignment
of the entrepreneur’s interests with those of
the firm through the large ownership positions. Angels also make smaller investments
and use syndication when investing in riskier
ventures. Another possible control mechanism is geographical proximity. The geographical proximity between angels and their
investments plays a large role in determining
the funding amount, control, and degree
of post-investment assistance provided by
angels.
