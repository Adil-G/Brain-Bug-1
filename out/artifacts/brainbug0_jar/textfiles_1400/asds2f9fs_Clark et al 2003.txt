Detailed examination of audio recordings of business-to-business
‘field-sales’ encounters are used to report one way in which salespeople elicit
verbal expressions of affiliation from their prospective customers – by
reciprocating second assessments which affiliate with, trade off and build on
prospects’ own assessments. This article outlines the prototypical features of
these junctures of assessment-affiliation and describes how salespeople can
mobilize such assessments to build extended sequences of ‘rapport’ that take
the form of adjacent and mutual expressions of substantive verbal affiliation.
Consideration is also given to explicating both the interactional basis of these
sequences as well as the socially obligating influence such affiliation and
rapport can have on sales outcomes.

Introduction
The ability of people to establish a rapport with others is widely held to be an
important and consequential factor in many types of interpersonal encounters.1
However, whilst there is a large literature documenting the communicative variables associated with rapport as well as the extrinsic factors which facilitate rapport, the processes by which rapport is constituted and cultivated has, as yet,
received only limited attention from researchers.
This article seeks to rectify this lacuna by examining a verbal process by
which salespeople can manage a rapport with their prospective customers (hereafter referred to as ‘prospects’) during real-life sales encounters.2 We report how
salespeople elicit agreements from their prospects by affiliating with prospects’
assessments (i.e. evaluations about someone or something) and, more specifically, by reciprocating affiliative second assessments which trade off prospects’
own assessments. We also describe how salespeople can extend these sequences
to create a rapport that takes the form of mutual and adjacent expressions of
substantive verbal affiliation by these parties to one another. We propose that

<-----Page 1----->6

these sequences are a particularly important form of rapport as they comprise
occurrences of these parties showing co-participation and social solidarity to one
other. Moreover, such verbal, ‘on-the-record’ evidence of substantial affiliation,
we argue, is treatable by both salespersons and their prospects as having some
socially obligating, promissory impact on sales outcomes derived from these
encounters.
Previous research in this subject area has tended to concentrate on determining the various non-verbal correlates of rapport, usually via experimental and
quantitatively oriented research methodologies. Such correlates include facial,
gestural and postural cues as well as spatial configurations between interactants,
such as: (i) smiling, head nodding, animated facial expressions (including those
which are compatible or expressive of mutual interest), high levels of eye-contact, facial synchrony; (ii) gestural synchrony, touching; (iii) postural sharing,
convergence and ‘mirroring’, symmetrical arm positions, uncrossed leg postures,
postures of involvement, open arm and leg postures; (iv) direct body orientation,
close proximity, forward leaning; and, more generally, (v) non-verbal expressions
of attentiveness, interest and involvement (Scheflen, 1964; LaFrance, 1979;
Trout and Rosenfeld, 1980; Harrigan et al., 1985; Harrigan and Rosenthal,
1986; Bernieri, 1988; Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal, 1990; Heintzman et al.,
1993; Drolet and Morris, 2000; Duggan and Parrott, 2001).
Verbal correlates that have been found to be significantly associated with rapport include restatements, minimal encouragers, reflections of feelings, silence
(lasting between 5–33 secs) and verbosity (Sharpley and Guidara, 1993;
Sharpley, 1997; Sharpley and McNally, 1997; Sharpley et al., 2000). Other studies, involving qualitative analysis of verbal action sequences in naturally occurring encounters, have shown that rapport can be created via joking and teasing,
cooperative complaining, and echoing (in the form of repetition of a co-interactant’s words/phrases) (Miller, 1995), and via reciprocated laughter (Lavin and
Maynard, 2001).
The prevalence of actions displaying or expressing ‘interactional synchrony
and congruence’ within this cited research links in with other studies showing
that rapport is associated with interactants having some perceived or real extrinsic similarity to one another. Studies of the selling process, for example, have
found that similarities between salespeople and their prospects in terms of age,
education, gender, height, nationality, political affiliation, race, religious preference, shared musical tastes and smoking) are associated with sales success
(Evans, 1963; Woodside and Davenport, 1974; Churchill et al., 1975; Riordan et
al., 1977). Other researchers have shown that the similarity between salespersons and their prospects can influence the trust, agreement or rapport that develops and which, in turn, can have a positive impact on sales outcomes (Gadel,
1964; Tosi, 1966; Busch and Wilson, 1976; though see Wilson and Gingold,
1981, for a critical overview of this research).3
Our study departs from the methodologies and analytical concerns of the vast
majority of this research, particularly in terms of our focus on examining the

<-----Page 2----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

hitherto relatively neglected dimension of verbal rapport in a naturalistic setting.
Furthermore, by adopting a data-driven approach and focusing on describing
and accounting for both how the salesmen we studied evidently created a rapport with their prospects as well as the social and interactional ‘rules’ they tacitly
attended to and capitalized on whilst doing so, we hope to demonstrate just how
interactionally organized, subtle and effortful a real-life process of verbal rapport
building can be.

The role of rapport in business-to-business sales encounters
Because the link between having a rapport and achieving a positive outcome
from an encounter seems inextricably intertwined, in certain situations interactants may not always leave rapport to chance. This is especially the case
in business-to-business field-sales encounters. As this form of selling is characteristically a long-term business where sales (or at least the maximum number
of potential sales) are only rarely obtained after a single sales visit, the quality of
the personal relationship established between such a salesperson and prospect
can play a particularly important role in the sales decision-making process.4
This, perhaps, is also the main reason why such field salespeople tend to avoid
employing ‘hard-sell’ tactics to secure a sale or otherwise persuade a prospect to
‘sign on the [contractual] dotted line’ at the end of any particular sales
encounter.5
Moreover, the outcomes of these encounters typically are more diverse than a
basic ‘purchase’/’non-purchase’ dichotomy. Indeed, it is not uncommon for field
salespeople to view a sales encounter as having been ‘successful’ even if no sale
has been obtained. In this context, successful sales outcomes can also include
receiving a positive, sales-enhancing response from a prospect, such as an opportunity to tender for goods or services required by the prospect’s company, a commitment to include a salesperson’s stock lists/brochures in the company library,
or even merely being allowed to contact the prospect again.
The salesmen we studied all drew attention to the importance of being alert
for signs of having established a rapport with their prospects. A variety of verbal
indicators of rapport were mentioned, such as (i) when a prospect switched to a
first-name only basis of address, (ii) postponed or quickly finished a telephone
call that had interrupted their meeting, and (iii) spoke in an agreeable, amenable
manner throughout the sales encounter. The salesmen also spoke of rapport
sometimes developing fortuitously, such as when an initially ‘hostile’ prospect
‘warmed to’ a salesman after the former realized they only lived two streets away
from each other, or when one prospect, who initially was ‘totally uncooperative’
towards the salesman, ‘radically changed his tune’ after noticing they were both
wearing an MG car-owner’s club tie.
The salesmen also stated that they regularly worked at verbally building a rapport with their prospects. Although none of these salesmen had received any
formal training in rapport building skills, one technique they all claimed to

7

<-----Page 3----->8

Discourse Studies 5(1)

employ was to ask their prospect questions not directly related to the business at
hand, especially at the start of an encounter. The prospect’s responses and, in
particular, his or her enthusiasm to talk at length off the topic (aided by the ability of the salesman to keep what they called such ‘small talk’ going), served, the
salesmen believed, as a barometer of how much the prospect ‘liked’ the salesman. Other verbal strategies the salesmen claimed routinely to employ included:
‘being friendly’, ‘cracking the odd joke’, ‘being supportive and sympathetic’,
‘acting natural – being yourself ’, ‘having an interest in what the prospect says’,
and ‘laughing at every crap joke they tell’.
The salesmen we studied faced two rapport-related tasks. One was to provide
their prospects with a favourable impression about themselves, the company
they represented and the goods they offered for sale which was conducive to a
purchase being made, if not immediately, then at some tangible future date.
Their second task was to draw accurate inferences from a prospect about
whether they had created or sustained a favourable impression. Given the diverse
sales outcomes which may arise from any single sales visit, the salesmen had to
rely on these inferences when determining what course of future action would be
most appropriate, such as whether a sale or further sales was likely to occur or
was worth pursuing. We demonstrate that the type of verbal affiliation and rapport examined in this article represented a particularly apposite means by which
the salesmen accomplished these tasks.

The foundation of verbal rapport – agreements, affiliations and
assessments
Agreements and, more generally, verbal expressions of affiliation are key elements of the type of rapport we examine in this article. One sequential environment where these actions are common is in the next turn to another speaker’s
assessment (Pomerantz, 1984: 63). With an assessment, speakers appraise or
express an opinion about someone or something and, in so doing, present their
evaluative ‘line’ (Goffman, 1967, 1970) with regard to that someone or something. In Extract 1, whilst answering the salesman’s (S) question, the prospect (P)
proffers an assessment (arrow A):6

In a study of conversational interaction, Pomerantz (1984) has shown that a
relevant next action for a recipient of an assessment – when the referent in that

<-----Page 4----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

assessment is ‘expectably accessible’ (sufficiently knowable) to the recipient – is
to agree or disagree with the assessment proffered (pp. 61–3). We also found, in
an overwhelming number of cases, that whenever a salesman addressed a
prospect’s assessment in a next turn (as they recurrently did), the salesman
agreed with that assessment. This happens in Extract 1 (arrow B).7 In so doing,
the salesman (as recipient of the assessment) affiliates with the evaluative line
taken in the prospect’s assessment and also co-participates with the prospect (as
assessor) him/herself.
The sales encounters we examined were littered with sequences where a
salesman affiliated with a prospect’s assessment in this manner. Yet there were
two reasons why these sequences did not, in themselves, constitute sufficient evidence of there being a rapport between these parties. First, although an agreement is evident, it is only the salesman who agrees with the prospect; the
prospect is not agreeing with the salesman. As such, the salesman is not provided with any verbal basis from which he could reliably infer that he is getting
on with the prospect.
Second, it also occasionally became apparent that certain post-assessment
agreement forms such as “Yes”, “Yeah it was”, “That’s right”, “I agree”, “True”,
“Absolutely”, etc. were held by the salesmen and prospects as not even being sufficient (or reliable) evidence of agreement, let alone rapport. These types of
agreements – which, for the purposes of this article, we call ‘basic’ agreements –
can be nominal agreements because they do not make available the grounds or
basis upon which one party agrees with the other. That is, such agreements
claim or assert rather than show or prove agreement (Pomerantz, 1984: 66–7;
Schegloff, 1984: 38–9; Sacks, 1992, e.g. Vol. 2: 252) and, as such, are always
open to being perceived as instances of what Goffman (1967) calls a ‘working
acceptance’ rather than a ‘real’ one. Indeed, these agreements may also not provide reliable or acceptable evidence of a speaker having understood or even
having listened to what the other speaker has said.
Pomerantz (1984: 66–8) has shown that these forms of agreement are a
characteristic feature of prefaces to disagreements and may, thus, be treated by a
recipient as being weak agreement or even as implying disagreement.8
Pomerantz (1984: 65) also reports that one way speakers show agreement with a
prior speaker’s assessment is by producing an affiliative second assessment in a
next turn. This happens in Extracts 2 and 3 (reproduced, in a simplified form,
from Pomerantz, 1984). In each case, speaker B shows agreement with speaker
A in a way in which strong agreement characteristically is shown by one speaker
with another – by proffering a second assessment which comprises an upgraded
version of speaker A’s assessment:
Extract 2
A: Isn’t he cute?
B: Oh he’s adorable.

Extract 3

B:
It was great fun.

Assessments are also a felicitous means of showing affiliation with a co-participant. Assessments are proffered as products of participation and one way of
co-participating with a co-interactant who proffers an assessment is by proffering a second assessment (Pomerantz, 1984: 57–9). In showing a stronger, more
substantial form of agreement via an affiliative second assessment (rather than
via a basic agreement), the salesman also shows a stronger, more substantial
form of co-participation with a prospect with regard to the activity reported in as
well as the activity occasioned by that prospect’s assessment.
Extract 4 comprises an instance where both the prospect and the salesman
treat the salesman’s basic agreements as being problematic evidence of agreement. The salesman has shown the prospect a piece of machinery that transpires
to be higher in specification and price to that used by the prospect’s company. The
prospect remarks (somewhat affiliatively) that the repair kit for the item his company uses costs more than the item itself. On three occasions after the salesman
affiliates with the prospect using basic agreements (arrowed as A) troublesome
silences emerge (arrowed as B):

spec. item, (0.3) as this.
Not at all, no.

In each case, these silences appear to have surfaced as a result of the prospect
holding off from starting to speak both after and because of the salesman’s basic
agreements. Moreover, the prospect’s “Mm” and “Mm hmm” acknowledgements
around the second and third of these ‘agreement–silence’ environments (lines

<-----Page 6----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

11 and 15 respectively), can be heard to indicate he is expecting something more
than the agreements the salesman has produced.9 As well as displaying an
understanding that the salesman may (or should) continue with his talk, these
acknowledgments may also have prompted the salesman to add to his basic
agreement responses. After each of these silences the salesman attempts to deal
with the negative implications of the prospect not having yet produced a
response.10 First, he commences then stops producing further talk in overlap
with the incoming prospect (line 7). Second, he produces a more intensified (yet
still ‘basic’) agreement (line 13). Third, it is only when the salesman produces an
assessment that shows affiliation with the prospect – by affirming that the item of
machinery he has shown the prospect is too high in specification for the
prospect’s needs (lines 16, 17 and 19) – that the prospect responds in a more
affiliating fashion (lines 18 and 20). Thus, more substantive affiliating utterances and, more specifically, those formulated as affiliating assessments, can
offset possible reservations a prospect may hold about a salesman’s affiliation by
virtue of the latter having affiliated with only basic agreement(s).
Therefore, from the salesmen’s point of view, affiliating with a prospect via
the use of basic agreements may actually hinder their quest to establish a rapport with that prospect. Indeed, persistently agreeing with what their prospect
says in this fashion may leave the prospect with the impression that the salesman
is a sycophantic ‘yes man’, in the business of slavishly and effortlessly attempting
to ingratiate himself.

Seller-initiated assessments
The salesmen could, of course, independently proffer their own assessments,
thereby supplying their prospects with a more substantial means for making
inferences about them. One advantage of the salesmen doing this is that they
may, in return, secure an affiliative response from their prospects. This is because,
as we have seen, an assessment provides the relevance of an agreement/disagreement response from the recipient of that assessment. Yet the salesmen
rarely did this. Assessments were most often produced, at least initially, by
prospects.
The trouble with a salesman independently initiating an assessment is that it
entails some risk, namely that there is an ever-present possibility that their
prospect might not affiliate with what the salesman has said. This happens in
Extract 5. The prospect mentions that her company purchases two types of
machinery (badged as “ABC”, line 9) in quantities of “five or ten” and “a hundred” at a time (lines 1 and 2). Subsequently, the salesman proffers the assessment that whilst the equivalent machinery his company sells has a different
name (i.e. “BCD”), they are “probably made all by the same people” (arrow A). The
prospect’s response “Possibly” (arrow B) is a downgraded, indeed contrastive,
version of the evaluative line taken by the salesman (indicated by “probably”)
and, as such, implies or prefigures disagreement (Pomerantz, 1984: 68–70):

P: (. . .) we only buy five or ten at a time on those but the others, ‘hhh we’d
buy-in a hundred at a time.
S: Yes.
(0.6)
S: Ah, ri ght.
P:

S: A h, right.
P: (It’s) the ABC ones we use at the moment.
S: ABC.

same people.
P: Possibly.=
S:
=But whether we are, compet itive we’ll have to see on that.
P:
Mm hmm,
P: Yes.

Moreover, the salesman treats the prospect’s “Possibly” as implying or
prefiguring disagreement; immediately after this response, the salesman
qualifies and thereby backs away from the evaluative line he had taken in his
prior, independently initiated assessment (line 15). In so doing, the salesman
succeeds in restoring the encounter to a more affiliative footing in that the
prospect affiliates with his now revised position (line 17), albeit with a basic
agreement.
Thus, in affiliating with a prospect or attempting to elicit affiliation from a
prospect the salesmen faced two problems. First, affiliating with prospects’
assessments by proffering basic agreements may be treated by prospects as not
being sufficient evidence of agreement (in any case, these agreements do not
provide the salesmen with any substantial evidence that their prospect is in
agreement with them). Second, if the salesmen were to initiate their own assessments in the expectation (or hope) of obtaining expressions of agreement from
prospects, there was the ever-present possibility that they may actually receive
damaging, non-affiliating responses in return. These problems appeared to give
rise to a series of verbal procedures that obviated these difficulties and, recurrently, enabled the salesmen to elicit affiliation from and move further toward
establishing a rapport with their prospects.

Reciprocating second assessments
Instead of (or, more usually, in addition to) affiliating with a prospect’s assessment with a basic agreement, the salesmen often produced a stronger, more substantive agreement in the form of an affiliative second assessment. Second
assessments are ‘assessments produced by recipients of prior assessments in
which the referents in the seconds are the same as those in the priors’

<-----Page 8----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

(Pomerantz, 1984: 59). Typically, the salesmen’s second assessments not only
shared the same referent as their prospect’s assessments, they also provided new
information to that contained in the prospect’s assessment – information which
traded off and built on the evaluative line taken in the prospect’s assessment. In
so doing, the salesmen provided the relevance of an agreement/disagreement
response from their prospect to their own second assessment and also encouraged (indeed, perhaps even constrained) the prospect to affiliate with the salesman in a next turn. We now examine three ways in which the salesmen affiliated
with, traded off and built on their prospects’ assessments – with ‘reformulated’,
‘embellished’ or ‘predictive’ second assessments.
1.

REFORMULATED SECOND ASSESSMENTS

With this type of assessment, the salesman reiterated the prospect’s assessment
in a different form. In Extract 6 the salesman responds to the prospect’s assessment – a somewhat self-congratulatory claim that “there are four or five of us
[i.e. buyers working in his office] that are all, a bit adaptable here” (arrow A) –
with the affiliative second assessment “you wear a few hats”, (arrow B):
Extract 6
P: (...) we concentrate on, erm, seeing, six, eight people a week, between us,
S: Mm hmm,
(0.6)
P: Erm, we’re concentrating on, on the export side, you know?
(0.5)
A → P: We-, we-, erm, we figure- there are four or five of us that are all, a bit
adaptable here,
(0.6)
B → S: Right, you wear a few hats,
(0.8)
C → P: That’s right, yeah.

By proffering that the prospect wears “a few hats”, the salesman reformulates
the prospect’s prior expression of his own occupational versatility. Here, as was
typically the case, the salesman’s second assessment elicits an affiliative response
in the prospect’s next turn (i.e. “That’s right, yeah”, arrow C).
We can now begin to account for how such second assessments can secure
affiliation from prospects. First, the salesman’s assessment is qualitatively different to the basic agreement response form contained in Extract 1 and discussed
earlier. Now the salesman shows rather than claims or asserts agreement with
the prospect. Saying that the prospect wears “a few hats” not only provides an
affirmation of the prospect’s occupational versatility, it also displays the salesman’s analysis of what being adaptable could mean.
Second, by virtue of proffering an assessment that is a different, non-repetitive version of the prospect’s assessment, the salesman, in effect, posits that his
assessment is independently held. In so doing, the salesman also generates a
heightened sense of his assessment being a spontaneous, unilateral expression of

13

<-----Page 9----->14

Discourse Studies 5(1)

affiliation that shows the salesman is genuinely ‘at one with’ the prospect and,
more specifically, with what the prospect has just said.
Third, in attending ‘backwards’ to what the prospect has just said (by affiliating with the evaluative line taken in the prospect’s assessment) and also in
moving the sequence ‘forwards’ (by adding new information that remains
consistent with the evaluative line taken in the prospect’s assessment), the salesman’s second assessment literally reciprocates the prospect’s assessment.
Furthermore, just as the prospect’s assessment provided the relevance of an
agreement/disagreement response from the salesman, the sufficiently different
content within the salesman’s second assessment re-initiates the relevance of an
agreement or disagreement in a next turn, now from the prospect, to the salesman’s own (second) assessment.
Fourth, given that the salesman’s affiliative second assessment has traded off
the evaluative line of the prospect’s own assessment (e.g. in Extract 6, by having
reformulated the prospect’s account of the adaptability of the buyers in his
office), in being structurally constrained to address the salesman’s second assessment the prospect also is structurally constrained to produce an affiliative
response in return. After all, the salesman has, in effect, just reiterated what the
prospect has said in a different form. If prospects then were to disagree with such
an affiliative second assessment it seems likely that they would either have to (i)
contradict the evaluative line taken in their own prior assessment, or (ii) do special work to display that they were not contradicting the evaluative line taken in
their prior assessment. As demonstrated later in this article, the prospect’s confirmative agreement at this juncture (arrow C) plays an important role, both in
consolidating the emerging agreement between these parties and also providing
for the extension of this three-turn sequence into a sequence more characteristic
of rapport.
2.

EMBELLISHED SECOND ASSESSMENTS

Instead of reiterating a prospect’s assessment in a different form, a salesman may
more markedly embellish it in an affiliative fashion. This happens in Extract 7.
The prospect is reporting the relative merits of CAD (computer-aided design) systems:
Extract 7
A → P: (. . .) and as long as-, as long as the amount of work you put in up front,
warrants a- what you get out of it then-, then great,
S: That’s right,
P: but there’s not many, CAD salesmen that will actually tell you the truth
about what you need up front.
S: Mmm,
(0.7)
B → S: ‘hhhhh This-, that’s the trouble as well isn’t it? (He says). ‘cause I
know, I bought myself a- sort’ve a personal computer recently, I’ve just
got a couple of new programmes for it and you spend hours,

<-----Page 10----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport
P: [laugh]
just trying to work out how to use the syst em
C → P:
That’s right, yeah,

The prospect’s assessments that “as long as the amount of work you put in up
front, warrants a- what you get out of it then-, then great” and “but there’s not
many, CAD salesmen that will actually tell you the truth about what you need up
front” (arrow A), display reservations about the merits of CAD systems and CAD
salespeople. His reservations are concerned mainly with the inordinate amount
of programming effort required to create a computer-aided design, when compared with the appearance of the finished design on a computer screen. It is this
line of ‘inordinate amount of preparatory work’ leading to ‘disappointing end
results’ that underpins the subject of the salesman’s second assessment (arrow
B). Here, the salesman builds on and trades off the prospect’s assessments by
talking about his own experiences of learning to use a new computer. In the
salesman’s second assessment, the theme shifts slightly to the inordinate amount
of time, and by implication effort (i.e. “you spend hours”) he has taken “just
trying to work out how to use the system”.
Once again, after having traded off and built on the prospect’s assessment,
the salesman’s affiliative second assessment elicits an expression of affiliation
from the prospect in a next turn (i.e. “That’s right, yeah” – arrow C, and also his
laughter).
3:

PREDICTIVE SECOND ASSESSMENTS

A third way the salesmen traded off prospects’ assessments were with predictive
second assessments. Here, because the evaluative line taken by the prospect was
more implicit, it was ‘predicted’ or otherwise anticipated by the salesman. In
Extract 8, the prospect reports having recently received a number of purchasing
requisitions from within his company. These requisitions contain products that
the prospect’s company have not previously purchased (i.e. “never dealt in, bbefore”, line 9):

Predictive assessments provide a candidate version of a putative line that is
only implied or embedded in the prospect’s own assessment. It is the predictive
accuracy of this line, expressed more explicitly in the salesman’s assessment,
which serves to show affiliation with the prospect. In Extract 8, the salesman’s
second assessment (“but you don’t turn your nose up”, arrow B), in stating that
the salesman would not turn down submitting a tender for such orders – given
the opportunity – projects a course of action that the salesman assumes the
prospect would expect companies like the salesman’s to take if asked to tender for
orders that included items which his (S’s) company did not usually stock or
supply. This is a course of action which expectably could follow from, but nevertheless has not yet been stated explicitly by, the prospect.
Indeed, at first glance it appears that the salesman’s second assessment has
been initiated independently. The prospect’s turn immediately before the salesman’s assessment does not contain an assessment; it reports only what the orders
he has received consists of (i.e. “things that we’ve never dealt in, b- before,
[laughs] tarpaulins and things like that”, lines 9–10). There is, however, an
assessment in an earlier segment of the prospect’s talk (i.e. “and, erm, if we cut it
it adds up to a lot of money”, arrow A). The salesman had responded to this
assessment, initially, with only a basic agreement (line 8). Yet it is this utterance
that appears to have provided the salesman with the materials for the particular
type of affiliating second assessment he subsequently provides. It proffers an
assessment of the prohibitive cost (or lack of profit) that would accrue if the
prospect had to split up the purchasing requisition and seek tenders for the items
listed in it from more than one company.
We can notice, again, that the prospect produces an affiliating response
to the salesman’s second assessment in a next turn (i.e. “No, that’s right”, arrow
C).
Let us now review our findings so far. By reciprocating a second assessment
which both affiliates with the evaluative line taken in the prospect’s assessment
and also trades off a prospect’s assessment by adding new information to
that contained in the prospect’s assessment, a salesman sets up a constraint
by which a non-affiliating response from a prospect is rendered less appropriate,
and an affiliating response more fitting. Through proffering such second assessments and receiving such affiliating responses in return, a salesman could show,
and a prospect could then confirm, that they were in agreement with one
another. Through these types of actions the salesmen could obviate, to some
greater extent, the interactional difficulties that can arise by virtue of affiliating with prospects using a basic agreement and/or producing self-initiated
assessments.

Managing rapport by extending sequences of mutual affiliation
Although agreements elicited from prospects (such as those examined earlier)
are an important component of rapport, they did not seem to be treated by the
salesmen or their prospects as being, in themselves, sufficient evidence of these
parties having a rapport with one another. Partly, this was because the agreement responses that prospects proffered to the salesmen’s second assessments
usually took the form of basic agreements.11 These agreements, we have argued,
in claiming or asserting agreement rather than showing or proving agreement,
may be held as not being adequate or genuine agreement. Nevertheless, in
receiving such an affiliative response, the salesmen were then provided with an
opportunity – in the form of a ‘free utterance space’, unencumbered with any
sequential turn constraints generated out of, for instance, the prospect’s/prior
speaker’s turn – to follow up and build on that affiliative response. The salesmen
we studied often followed such affiliative responses with an action that provided
the relevance of (and recurrently elicited) additional expressions of affiliation
from their prospect, thereby creating a sequence more indicative of rapport. This
occurs in Extract 9. The prospect is talking about the difficulties he has faced in
deciding which sales representatives to buy from and proffers the assessment
that “it’s all trial-, trial an’ error”, arrow A):
Extract 9
A → P: it’s all trial-, tri al an’ error,
S:
(Well) this is it,=
P:
=yeah,
y’know.=
B → S:

D → S: But er, anyway it’s a start (I mean,)
E → P:
( )
Well that’s it, you’ve got your foot in the
doorway [laughs]

The salesman’s second assessment (“it takes a long time to evaluate these
things really”, arrow B), in providing a candidate instance of one of the vagaries
of the salesperson selection process facing professional buyers like the prospect,
affiliates with, builds on and trades off the prospect’s assessment. The prospect
affiliates with this second assessment, employing the basic agreement “Well
that’s it” (arrow C). The salesman then extends this three-turn sequence with a
further affiliative assessment (“But er, anyway it’s a start”, arrow D), and this
elicits another expression of affiliation from the prospect (i.e. “Well that’s it,
you’ve got your foot in the doorway [laughs]”, arrow E). In doing this, the salesman obtains an additional and consecutive response confirming that the
prospect is in agreement with him.
This more elaborate five-turn sequence typically proceeds as follows:

This sequential pattern is also apparent in Extract 10. The salesman and prospect
are talking about computer games:

erm, but that’s quite difficult,
(.)

S:
[laughing] Yeah,
P: I’m still on level one, ‘hhh which is the simplest level (. . .)

Some typical properties of these longer sequences of mutual affiliation can
now be reported. First, the salesmen’s utterances that extended the first three
turns of these sequences traded off and built on what the prospect had affiliated
with thus far. For example, in Extract 10 the salesman’s assessment (arrow D)
comprises an embellishment of his prior (second) assessment (which had, in
itself, traded off the prospect’s own initial assessment) about difficulties in using
computer keyboards (arrow B). From talking initially, and in general terms,
about “remembering what keys you’ve got to press for what”, the salesman then
provides a more specific illustration of this difficulty in practice (i.e. “you’re pressing X when you should be pressing Y”). In proffering another assessment that,
again, contains new information, the salesman provides the relevance of the
prospect to address this assessment with an agreement or disagreement response
in a next turn. By producing an additional affiliative assessment that maintains
the evaluative line taken in both the prospect’s initial assessment and the salesman’s second assessment – an evaluative line that the prospect already affiliated

<-----Page 14----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

with in response to the salesman’s second assessment (arrow C) – the salesman
further constrains the prospect to proffer an affiliating response in a next turn.
Indeed, in electing to extend the first three turns of these sequences in this fashion, the salesman creates the conditions where the prospect’s next response is
now even more likely to be an affiliative response. After all, the salesman had
already received one expression of affiliation from the prospect to an assessment
taking the same evaluative line as the salesman proceeds to take in his subsequent assessment.
Second, when a salesman extended the first three turns of these sequences
with an additional assessment and received a second affiliative response from a
prospect, that second response was, overwhelmingly, a relatively more substantial expression of affiliation than the prospect had provided to the salesman’s
prior affiliative (second) assessment. More specifically, at this juncture prospects’
responses usually took the form of affiliative assessments rather than only basic
agreements. In Extract 9, for example, the prospect’s first affiliative response is
“Well that’s it”, a basic agreement (arrow C), whereas his second response contains the affiliative assessment “you’ve got your foot in the doorway” (arrow E).
Thus, by extending this sequence with a further assessment a salesman may
(and most often would) receive a response that not only confirmed but also
showed the prospect’s agreement with him. In producing a more substantive
second affiliating response the prospects display an attention to the progressive
and developmental character of the affiliation sequence that was emerging, as
well as to the consequent propriety, if not obligation, to move beyond claiming or
asserting agreement and, instead, showing or proving it.
Third, each of the prospects’ second, and usually more substantive, affiliative
responses (arrow E) tended to trade off and build on the salesman’s own tradedoff third assessments (arrow D). For instance, in Extract 9 the prospect’s assessment (i.e. “you’ve got your foot in the doorway”, arrow E) is a reformulation of
the salesman’s prior assessment “anyway it’s a start” (arrow D). Both assessments refer to the salesman having passed the hurdle of obtaining a first order
from, and thereby gaining entry as a potentially regular supplier of goods to the
prospect’s company.
In Extract 10 the prospect’s affiliative assessment embellishes the salesman’s
prior (third) assessment. Once more, the topic is ‘having difficulty with computers’. The salesman has talked about the trouble he has experienced using a computer keyboard while playing computer games (arrow D). The prospect then
affiliates with and expands on this theme by talking about the trouble he has
faced playing one particularly difficult computer game (arrow E).
That the prospects at this juncture tended to produce such affiliatively ‘safe’
extensions to what has mutually been agreed to thus far suggests the existence of
a heightened constraint to do so. One factor which appears to confirm this
claim is that the affiliative assessments produced by the salesmen and prospects
during these sequences in general and at this juncture in particular were commonly formulated as cliches, idioms or figurative speech. This did not seem to be

19

<-----Page 15----->20

Discourse Studies 5(1)

coincidental. One is tempted to conclude that the constraint to show affiliation
substantively at such short notice is what accounts for the prevalence of such
stock utterances during these sequences. However, Drew and Holt (1988) have
shown that figurative expressions such as “You wear a few hats” (Extract 6) and
“You’ve got your foot in the doorway’ (Extract 9) seem to be treated as being
beyond empirical challenge. In the context of selling, and especially at the junctures we have examined where the salesmen and prospects are, in their own different ways, each constrained somewhat to produce affiliation (and substantive
affiliation at that), deploying figurative expressions and the like is a felicitous
means of reducing what surely is an ever-present possibility of that utterance
subsequently being treated non-affiliatively by a co-participant.
In these extended sequences one can now see both a prospect and salesman
affiliating and then re-affiliating substantively with one another in adjacent
turns of talk – actions indicative of there being a verbal rapport between these
parties at that particular juncture of their encounter. Indeed, the means
employed by the salesmen and prospects to affiliate with each other in Extracts 9
and 10 can be (and in our corpus regularly were) utilized to extend these
sequences of mutual affiliation even further.

Dealing with prospects’ non-affiliation
Even when a salesman’s assessment had affiliated with and traded off a
prospect’s assessment that salesman’s assessment did not always then yield an
affiliative response from that prospect. Such assessments display a recipient’s
own analysis of the evaluative line taken in another speaker’s prior assessment
and, in the encounters we examined, the evaluative line taken in the salesmen’s
second assessments did not always transpire to concur with the evaluative line
their prospect had taken or subsequently claimed to have taken. When a prospect
expressed some reservations about, took issue or disagreed with a salesman’s
affiliative assessment, a situation of non-affiliation and non-rapport between
these parties becomes apparent. Consequently, the salesman may act to remedy this
occurrence and attempt to restore the interaction to a more affiliative footing.
This happens in Extract 11. At the end of a report listing the international
locations of her company’s new offices and outlets, the prospect produces the
assessment “So, we’re doing extremely well, thank goodness” (lines 6 and 8).
This eventually receives the affiliative assessment “Not very many companies can
sort of say that these days” from the salesman (line 11). It then becomes apparent that the prospect has some reservations about what the salesman has just
said:
Extract 11
1 P: (. . .) we’ve offices in France and erm, in

Germany now as well, ‘hhhhh er, and we’ve

The prospect, for instance, holds off from addressing the salesman’s assessment (lines 13 and 15). This silence is broken, though only momentarily, by the
salesman’s “But er” (line 14). This partial start, in containing two speech items
common to the beginnings of troubles recognition/exit utterances, hints at the
salesman’s cognizance of his second assessment being incongruous with what
the prospect has said. The utterance the prospect then produces (i.e. “Glad we
can”, line 16), in addressing the salesman’s assessment only insofar as it applies
to her company, has a downgraded character; the prospect continues to hold off
from affiliating with the salesman’s attempt to affiliate with her. The salesman
treats this response as a set-back by changing the topic (line 19), the result of
which, like the remedial action discussed in Extract 8, elicits affiliation from the
prospect, albeit in the form of a basic agreement.
There were two characteristic features of these non-affiliation sequences.
First, the salesmen invariably attempted to repair their earlier, now problematic
affiliative assessments and they did so in a manner which avoided imputing
blame on the prospect for the disparate evaluative lines that had emerged. The
most common ways the salesmen attempted to repair such assessments was by
moving off the topic, revising their problematic assessment or by backing away
from the evaluative line they originally had taken (and, presumably, had inferred
that their prospect had taken) and affiliating with the prospect’s ‘new’ line. The
prevalence of these remedial procedures at these junctures indicates that the
salesmen treated the emergence of non-affiliating responses from prospects
as having some negative consequence for their quest to present a favourable
impression of themselves to, elicit affiliation from and build a rapport with their
prospects.
Second, when a salesman’s affiliative assessment received a non-affiliating
response from a prospect it recurrently turned out that the salesman’s assessment was treated by the prospect in one of two ways: (i) as if the salesman had

21

<-----Page 17----->22

Discourse Studies 5(1)

misunderstood the evaluative line taken in the prospect’s assessment; or (ii) as if
the salesman had co-assessed something the prospect now asserts or implies the
salesman did not appropriately have access to assess. Both these forms of incongruity allow for a prospect to address their salesperson’s affiliative assessment in
a non-affiliative way.12
For instance, in Extract 11, the source of the salesman’s incongruous assessment seems to stem from him misreading what the prospect meant by “thank
goodness” (line 8). This phrase expresses a combination of appreciation and gratitude that the company for which she works is “doing very well”. The salesman
affirms the unusual nature of this success with “Not very many companies can
sort of say that” (line 11), and also proffers a basis for that success being unusual
(i.e. “these days”, line 11). At the very least, both “thank goodness” and “these
days” speak to the capricious, uncertain nature of the business world these parties inhabit. But by focusing on non-success as well as asserting that non-success
is the current business norm, the salesman’s assessment, although affiliative in
character, can also be heard to contrast with and thus sully somewhat the
prospect’s report of her own company’s experience. Indeed, the salesman’s
assessment could also be heard as him implicitly positing that, in the economic
climate of “these days” the prospect’s report is an instance of insensitive or naive,
overweening pride.

Discussion and conclusion
Reciprocating an affiliative assessment that trades off and builds on a prior
speaker’s assessment is one way of structurally encouraging (if not constraining)
affiliation from that prior speaker. This activity is likely to feature in encounters
where affiliation is deemed to be worthy of cultivation by at least one party and
where no expressions of affiliation and expressions of non-affiliation from the
other party are liable to have a compromising impact on their encounter or any
outcome derived from it. This was the case in the business-to-business field sales
encounters we examined. These salespeople, it seems, viewed affiliation and rapport to be so important to their quest to create a good impression and to secure a
positive sales outcome that they undertook special verbal work to manage affiliation from and build a rapport with their prospects.
In our data, there was a marked tendency for the salesmen to agree with
prospects’ assessments, to proffer affiliative second assessments that traded off
their prospects’ assessments, to build on and extend the affiliation they recurrently received and to attempt to repair expressions of prospect non-affiliation
whenever they arose. These actions are consistent with the salesmen working
from the premise that the more instances of affiliating responses (particularly
substantial affiliating responses) and the fewer non-affiliative responses they
received from prospects, the more likely their chance of obtaining a positive sales
outcome, if not indeed a sale, from their encounter. Yet whilst these verbal procedures and the rapport sequences they recurrently generated did not directly refer

<-----Page 18----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

to, occasion or determine a sales outcome there are at least two reasons why it
would be erroneous to treat them as being a residual and unimportant feature of
the selling project the salesmen were, after all, primarily engaged in.
First, in field-sales, where the possible outcomes which may arise are diverse
and non-equivalent, such junctures of affiliation and rapport allowed these parties safely to express and infer both whether they were ‘getting on with’ each
other and what such a getting on implied (e.g. whether or not a sale was likely to
occur). Such activities (i) obviated the salesmen having to sell in a manner which
officially asked for or explicitly attempted to persuade a prospect to make a purchase; and (ii)obviated prospects having explicitly to resist or reject a salesman in
his quest to obtain a sale. Both of these activities, in generating potentially face
threatening situations (Goffman, 1967), can undermine whatever relationship is
established by these parties during their current encounter as well as any future
relationship between the companies these parties represented.
Second, such ‘small talk’ seemed not to be of small economic consequence.
The activities described in this article, we propose, serve as a major way for
prospects to express and salespeople to deduce whether or not a sale (or at least a
positive, sales related outcome) is likely to occur because prospects’ verbal expressions of affiliation and non-affiliation each implicate particular, non-equivalent
types of sales outcomes.
Goffman (1970) proposes that the conduct of interactants has a ‘promissory
character’ (p. 14). This creates tacit moral assumptions, reliances and expectations that commit each interactant to a particular type of future conduct which
is consistent with the shared ‘definition of the situation’ they collaboratively and
inferentially establish during their encounter. The type of rapport we have
described is a particularly important ‘predictive device’ (p. 241) in this regard.
Each verbal expression of affiliation (and non-affiliation) from a prospect comprises an ‘on the record’, accountable yardstick of the state of the relationship
prevailing between these interactants. And these activities are treatable as
having predictive relevance not only for (a) what subsequently occurs in their
encounter being consistent with what already has been established in that
encounter, but also for (b) any outcome that may result from their encounter
being consistent with what was established during that encounter.13
Presumably, in responding to the salesmen affiliatively, prospects recognized
(or were soon likely to learn) that agreements and, in particular, affiliative assessments were liable to encourage the extension or re-initiation of these episodes of
affiliation. By so doing, the prospects tacitly consented (and could be heard by
their salesman to tacitly consent) both to the verbal rapport that usually then
emerged and to an outcome that was consistent with what that mutually constituted verbal rapport implied – a heightened obligation to either proffer or agree
to a positive outcome if not, indeed, a sale.14
Such sequential processes and the associated structural constraints that they
invoke are not unusual in interaction in general or selling encounters in particular. For instance, as Heritage (1984: 278) points out, pre-sequence utterances

23

<-----Page 19----->24

Discourse Studies 5(1)

are commonly mobilized in conversation to pre-emptively and non-explicitly
solicit the active collaboration of a recipient in forwarding preferred actions (e.g.
by obtaining an implied consent to an as yet unannounced invitation, story/joke
telling etc.) and avoiding (by aborting) dispreferred actions. In responding positively and affiliatively to a pre-sequence utterance an interactant is, in effect, rendered under some heightened obligation to consent to the action the
pre-sequence utterance prefigures (e.g. an invitation) when it subsequently and
officially is announced.
With regards to selling encounters, research suggests that salespeople can sell
more effectively by securing purchase implicative commitments from their
prospects. In studies based on video analyses of real-life sales encounters, Clark
and Pinch (1988, 1992, 1995) describe how street market pitchers and mock
auction scam workers prospectively manage sales success by soliciting ostensibly
innocent expressions of ‘interest’ in or involvement with the goods offered for
sale from shoppers. These salespeople then retroactively invoke such displays of
interest or involvement as having been purchasing implicative expressions that
thereby place such shoppers under a more ineluctable obligation to purchase
those goods.
Thus, checking out the likelihood of something being consented to (e.g. with
a pre-sequence utterance) and prospectively managing the likelihood of something being consented to (e.g. via soliciting purchase implicative responses from
a sales prospect) are but two peas from the same ‘project based’ interactional pod.
Nevertheless, they tend to differ in the degree to which latter process less obviously and thus less anticipatably displays the instigator of the action sequence (in
our case a salesman) (i) engaging in ‘pre-sequence work’, and (ii) relying on or
capitalizing on the constraints such prospective work invokes to secure a preferred outcome from the encounter.
On a more general level, these episodes of mutual affiliation are more than
displays of a salesperson and prospect showing co-participation and social solidarity with one another. Assessments, in evaluatively presenting a person’s sense
of or personal experience of someone or something, also comprise moments
where an aspect of one’s ‘self ’ or ‘identity’ is revealed to a co-participant. Of
course, this self or identity need not be ‘genuine’. Likewise, affiliative second
assessments perform equivalent, revelatory and veridical roles for the co-participant – with two important provisos. First, such assessments, in being affiliative,
also show an acceptance of the self/identity claimed by the prior speaker and, on
that basis, confirm and give added credence to the prior speaker’s presented
self/identity. Indeed, in our data, the pressure on the salesmen to create a sociable, affiliative relationship with their prospects often seemed to encourage
prospects to indulge in presenting a self/identity that otherwise would not
be socially acceptable for them to reveal, let alone revel in. Nevertheless, the task
of listening to, affirming and encouraging the self-aggrandizing that prospects
often engaged in during these encounters seemed a cheap (but surely onerous)
price the salesmen had to pay for the opportunity this afforded them to elicit

<-----Page 20----->Clark et al.: Managing verbal affiliation and rapport

affiliation from, manage a rapport with and attempt to secure sales from their
prospects.
Second, whilst reciprocated, affiliative assessments show that the salesman’s
self/identity is ‘at one with’ that of the prospect, that self/identity so presented
also may not (and need not) be genuine. Indeed, the pressure on a salesman to
show affiliation with a prospect in our sales encounters provides a very strong
basis for the self/identity that the salesmen presented not being genuine.
Nevertheless, in affiliating with such reciprocated assessments, the prospect tacitly accepts (and, as we have seen, is somewhat constrained to accept) both the
self/identity the salesman presents himself at that juncture to be and their resulting similarity to and affinity with one another that the prospect’s affiliative
response(s) evidently establishes. But the purchasing implicative obligation that
such a show of acceptance is likely to generate for a prospect is also likely to
carry both an interactional and an economic cost which that prospect may subsequently have to pay.
In our data, a rapport between a salesman and a prospect did not only (or
even significantly) emerge fortuitously. Nor did it evidently stem from, or noticeably depend on extrinsic factors such as the inherent similarity of the salesman
and prospect to one another. Indeed, the manner in which the salesmen obtained
expressions of affiliation from and occasioned a rapport with their prospects indicated the presence of a series of related communicative procedures that obviated
them having to rely on these types of factors to establish a rapport. With the
verbal procedures we have examined, the salesmen we studied attempted to sell
to their prospects by selling a particular version of themselves. The self or identity of the salesmen (and, undoubtedly, the prospects) that emerged during these
sequences, and the relationship, similarity and rapport that developed between
them was essentially an interactionally accomplished social artefact, expressed
in, managed through and inferred from the ongoing, seemingly economically
consequential ‘small talk’ of the sales encounter itself.

1. Researchers have claimed or shown that rapport can have a significant if not decisive
impact on the success of, for instance, counsellor–client interactions (e.g. Sharpley
and McNally, 1997; Nguyen and Bowles, 1998; Sharpley et al., 2000; Joe et al.,
2001), police interviews with victims of crime (Sandoval and Adams, 2001), athlete–coach relationships (Douge, 1997), instructor–student encounters (Bernieri,
1988; Perkins et al., 1995), staff perceptions of supervisors (Heintzman et al., 1993),
physician–patient consultations (Harrigan and Rosenthal, 1986; Duggan and
Parrott, 2001), researcher–subject access and quality (e.g. Berk and Adams, 1976;

and business relationships, performance and outcomes (e.g. Wilson and Gingold,
1980; Miller, 1995; Nancarrow and Penn, 1998; Drolet and Morris, 2000).
2. Our study is based on an examination of transcribed audio recordings of 14 real-life
business-to-business ‘field-sales’ encounters – where salespeople travel to meet and
sell to prospects at the latter’s business premises or work-sites. These involved 4 salesmen from one UK distributor of engineering products (valves, pipe-line etc.) and 14
prospects (such as buyers and engineers), from 13 different UK companies. This
corpus was collected by one of the researchers following each salesman for one day
and recording all the sales encounters that took place (either 3 or 4 encounters were
recorded for each salesman). The researcher was present, though typically silent,
during each of these encounters. We feel confident that the researchers’ presence and
the use of pocket-sized recording equipment had a minimal impact on these encounters. In the UK, this process of ‘shadowing’ a salesperson and being present as a silent
third party during a field sales encounter is commonly used by this type of company
(and accepted by their prospects) as a means of training neophyte salespeople and
monitoring the performance of sales staff.
3. Although there are wide variations in how rapport is defined and operationalized in
these studies, there are, nevertheless, some recurrent themes which we now summarize: rapport comprises a relationship between two or more people, characterized by
feelings of mutual positivity, harmony, cohesive bonding and co-interactants being
‘at one with’ each other. These feelings are borne from interpersonal encounters
characterized by reciprocated displays or expressions of other-involvement, such as
attentiveness, empathy, friendliness, warmth, interest, liking, approval, agreement,
interest, enthusiasm, understanding, cooperation, support, closeness, and the like.
(More detailed treatment of the conceptualization of rapport can be found in Blanck
et al., 1986; Harrigan and Rosenthal, 1986; Bernieri, 1988; Tickle-Degnen and
Rosenthal, 1990; Argyle, 1990; Hendrick, 1990; DePaulo and Bell, 1990; and Drolet
and Morriss, 2000.) The verbal rapport we examine in this article embraces, to a
greater or lesser degree, all the constituent features of rapport listed earlier.
4. In addition, factors such as the specification, price and delivery times of the products
these salespeople attempt to sell are often not prohibitively dissimilar to those of their
competitors.
5. From our interviews with these salesmen it was readily apparent that having a rapport with their prospects was deemed to exert a decisive influence on the success of
their encounters and, more specifically, on whether a sale was likely to occur. For
example, one salesman said, “If they [prospects] don’t like the sales rep they won’t
buy your gear, it’s as simple as that”. Another claimed that this type of selling was
“predominantly if not exclusively about selling yourself ”.
6. An explanation of the transcription symbols we have used is provided in the
Appendix. Our transcription process is a simplified version of that developed by Gail
Jefferson and employed by conversation analysts (see e.g. Sacks et al., 1974, and
Atkinson and Heritage, 1984: ix–xvi).
7. Pomerantz (1984: 77–95) shows that certain types of assessments such as self-deprecating and self-critical assessments invite (and engender) disagreement as the structurally preferred next action of a recipient. There were no examples of these
assessments in our corpus and, thus, the agreements the salesmen provided to their
prospects’ assessments were, in every case, a structurally preferred next action.

other form of basic agreement], but ...’

agreements regularly preceded the more substantive affiliative assessments within a
speaker’s turn – see, e.g., Extracts 6–9 (each arrowed as B) and Extracts 9 and 10
(both arrowed as E). In Extract 10 (between arrows D and E) it is the salesman who
seems to be waiting for more substantive agreement from the prospect.
10. For an account of silences in conversational interaction, see e.g. Sacks et al., 1974;
Jefferson, 1989. For analyses of silences projecting troublesome responses in conversation, see e.g. Davidson, 1984; Jefferson, 1989. See also Clark et al., 1994 for a
study of silences projecting prospects’ non-acceptances of sales proposals during telephone selling encounters. Conversely, one often finds that affiliation and agreement
are also marked sequentially (Pomerantz, 1984: 69–70). For instance, the salesmen
and prospects in our study often produced affiliation in overlap with the other
speaker’s talk. This is evident in many of the sequences in this article, Extract 9
providing a particularly explicit case.
11. This is the case, for instance, in Extracts 6–8 (arrow C) and in Extracts 9 and 10 (also
arrowed as C).
12. Prospects, as recipients of affiliative second (or subsequent) assessments that can be
treated as having misunderstood what was said in an initial assessment are, of
course, not constrained to disaffiliate with what the salesman has said. A prospect
may, instead, let the misunderstanding pass; they may even affiliate with their salesperson’s incongruous assessment, employing one of the weaker, basic agreement
forms. In our data, prospects who took the opportunity to disaffiliate with a salesman’s affiliative assessment were displaying one way of resisting and discouraging
the salesman’s attempt to secure affiliation and build a rapport. Another way a
prospect could pre-empt the emergence of sequences where that prospect may end up
being constrained to affiliate with the salesperson (not dealt with here) is by initiating
assessments which are not expectably assessable to that salesperson.
13. Further research is required to ascertain whether the various nonverbal correlates of
rapport cited earlier operate in the same rapport-constituting, obligation-inducing
manner as we have proposed to be the case with the verbal actions outlined in this
article. However, the social obligation that activities such as rapport building and rapport confirmation can generate (and, presumably, are utilized in order to generate)
appears to be more readily achievable in and through verbal rather than nonverbal
elements of action sequences.
14. Preliminary inspection of outcomes from these encounters seem to provide at least a
crude confirmation of our claim. For instance, the two encounters which had the
highest number of instances of prospects expressing affiliation with their salesman’s
reciprocated assessments achieved a sale. In one of these encounters, the prospect
agreed to a sale during the encounter; in the other encounter, the prospect made a
purchase one week later. Conversely, the two least positive sales outcomes followed
encounters where the number of such prospect affiliations were much lower and the
number of prospect non-affiliations with a salesman’s reciprocated assessments were
highest. These outcomes took the form of one salesman being told by a prospect that
he was ‘happy’ with his current supplier and the other salesman remarking to the
researcher that he was ‘certain’ he would be allowed to visit the prospect again only
‘if or when the need arises’. It may also not be coincidental that the two salesmen
involved in the most successful encounters were not the same two salesmen involved
in the least successful encounters.

‘hhhh
,&.

Silence within a speaker’s talk or between speakership exchanges: the number
within parentheses is the time that elapsed in seconds and/or tenths of seconds.
A micro-pause, a silence which is estimated to have a duration of less than three
tenths of a second.
Audible breathing: each ‘h’ lasts approximately one tenth of a second.
Commas indicate upward intonation and projectably incomplete turns; full-stops
indicate downward intonation and potentially completed turns.

Contiguous utterances

Talk

Elongated parentheses, sometimes empty, are used to represent the occurrence
of talk that was difficult to hear and transcribe. An estimation of what was said
may be provided within these brackets.
Talk that is underscored is spoken louder or emphasized by prolonging the
words (usually by stretching a vowel).
