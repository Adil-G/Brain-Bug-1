Disease States and Measurements:
I. Theory
CLYDE B. SCHECHTER, MD
The question of whether to perform a continuous valued test to assess a continuous valued
health state such as blood pressure or serum cholesterol is explored by decision analysis.
Principal assumptions are that the underlying health state and measurement variability are
both normally distributed, and that the impact of treatment on the utility of outcomes varies
linearly with the underlying health state. Using Bayes’ theorem, an expression for the expected utility of performing the test is derived and compared with immediate treatment or
decision to withhold treatment. The calculations can be carried out with a pocket calculator
and a table of the normal distribution. Iterating the analysis, a sequential decision making
process is developed, leading to a series of no treat/test again and test again/treat thresholds
with which a running average of independently obtained measurements can be compared
to produce stepwise optimal results. The thresholds are readily calculated on a microcomputer. Finally, the conjugate-normal-linear model is extended to encompass the correlated
observations that may be made on a single visit. This paper concentrates on the mathematics
of decision making with continuous variables. The companion paper illustrates its application
to diastolic blood pressure. Key words: decision analysis; Bayes’ theorem; conjugate-normallinear model; hypertension. (Med Decis Making 1990;10:242-255)

The

theory of Bayesian decision making, as develfor
oped,
example, by Savage,’ is designed to help make
such decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Applying this framework to deciding when to order a
diagnostic test, Pauker and Kassirer~ set out the threshold decision-making approach.
Unfortunately, Pauker and Kassirer’s method is not
applicable to hypertension, a common disease of adults,
for three reasons. First, there is no discrete disease
hypertension: lower blood pressures are associated
with better health and longer life throughout the range
observed in ambulatory patients. Observed blood pressures are continuously, unimodally distributed over a
broad range. The distinction between &dquo;hypertensives&dquo;
and &dquo;normotensives&dquo; is simply a dichotomization of
a continuum, reflecting the sense that below some
point the costs and risks associated with blood pressure reduction outweigh the benefits.
Second, the &dquo;test&dquo; for hypertension consists of blood
pressure determination, which does not yield a positive or negative result but estimates the blood pres-

sidered normal practice and is recommended, to a
limited extent, by national authorities.’ The considerations of these last three paragraphs also apply to
the management of blood cholesterol levels, another
common problem in medicine.
There is therefore a need to apply decision analysis
to situations with continuous health states and continuous, repeatable measurements. This paper presents such an application. I describe a specially tailored
conjugate-normal model of such measurements and
health states, along with a model of the relevant utilities. From these, an expression for the utility of measurement before deciding about treatment is derived
and a decision rule formulated. A stopping rule for

Bayesian sequential decision theory is set out in

more familiar to clinical decision analysts, emphasizing blood pressure as its focus. A companion paper’

patient’s blood pressure is measured repeatedly, differing results will be obtained. The challenge to the
clinician is to make sense of these fluctuating data, to
know when to get more of them, and when to reach
a final decision about intervention.
The following model has been fitted and usefully
applied to diastolic blood pressure in earlier work.8,9
Assume that any patient’s diastolic blood pressure if
measured at every instant would follow a normal
(Gaussian) distribution. The mean of that distribution,
denoted x, is a characteristic of that patient which I
refer to as the &dquo;true&dquo; or &dquo;latent&dquo; blood pressure of the
patient. Any particular measurement we obtain, denoted y, is a sample of size 1 from that distribution.

The right side of equation 1 refers to a normal distribution with mean x and variance T~. Throughout this
paper and its companion, the assumption about sufficient time separation between measurements to permit us to treat them as conditionally independent is
implicit in the term &dquo;measurement.&dquo; If a device is used
repeatedly in a short span of time during which separate results could not, for practical purposes, be regarded as conditionally independent, I refer to those
results as &dquo;observations.&dquo; Observations will be dealt
with near the end of this paper.
For any person, x is unknowable. It may be estimated from measurements, but its precise value can
never be determined. From the Bayesian perspective,
x is a random variable. Empirically, if the entire population of a community were available and an oracle
provided the value of x for each of them, the x’s themselves would have a frequency distribution. It is assumed that the x’s are also normally distributed; we

The key qualitative points to emphasize are: 1) the
posterior distribution is again normal, which will prove
useful for sequential decision making; 2) the variance
of the distribution of x decreases by a factor of 1- Iin.
Notice that we always have 0 ~ r < 1, with equality
only under the unrealistic condition that Q2 or TZbe
zero. The number r can be shown to equal the testretest reliability of a single measurement.&dquo; Values of
r close to 1 reflect nearly perfect measurement; values
near 0 correspond to noisy measurements that are
pale reflections of x.
For a given conditional distribution, a family of prior
distributions that combine with it under Bayes’ theorem to produce a posterior distribution belonging to
the family is known as a conjugate family for that conditional distribution.12 Here the conditional distribution is normal, and the conjugate family is the class
of normal distributions. When an unknown parameter
and conditionally independent measurements bear
these relationships, as x and y do, it is convenient to
refer to y as a conjugate-normal measurement of x. A
review of the symbols introduced so far (and others
to come later) appears in table 1.

TREATMENT UTILITY

Risk of cardiovascular disease increases with blood
pressure. Interventions to lower blood pressure reduce the risk; but they carry adverse effects of their
own and impose burdens of inconvenience, time lost
for medical follow up, and monetary expense on the
subjects. Explicitly modeling all of these effects is an
enormous task, beyond the scope of this manuscript,
and has been explored by Weinstein and Stason. 13 In
part for reasons of mathematical simplicity, and in part
motivated by their results, I instead take the following
holistic approach to the relevant utilities: if the utility,
the numerical expression of patient preference, for the
natural history of life with latent blood pressure x is
U(x), I assume that the utility of life with pretreatment
latent blood pressure x and treatment to reduce blood
pressure is U(x) + some linear function of x.
One algebraic representation of linear functions is
especially convenient. If x is sufficiently high, treatment will be preferred to natural history; if x is sufficiently low, natural history will be preferred to
treatment. There is some cutoff value of latent blood
pressure, q, for which the patient is indifferent between treatment and natural history. Above q, the patient prefers treatment; below q, untreated life is
preferred. This value of q determines the patient’s
functional definition of &dquo;hypertension.&dquo;
The Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC) has, in
essence, recommended that blood pressure be lowered when it exceeds 90 mmHg diastolic,3in effect
prescribing the value q 90 for all persons. From the
Bayesian perspective adopted here, however, the value
of q should be determined from individual patient
preferences and depends upon both external matters
(such as other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases)
and attitudinal factors. Of course, the practical difficulties in eliciting q from the patient should not be
underestimated; the process is approached in the

utility from treatment as a linear function, a slope

by which the patient’s preference for treatment over
natural history increases for each unit increase in latent blood pressure. Its units are utiles/mmHg. I am
not aware of procedures for determining overall utility
slopes from patient preferences, though Miyamoto and
Eraker’s work&dquo; parametrically connecting utility with
quality-adjusted life years is related. In any case, once
L is determined, we can write the expected gain in
utility from treatment as L~ (x - q). Accordingly, for a

The assumption of a linear relationship between latent
blood pressure and effect of treatment is the most
stringent one in this model. The evidence favoring it
is reviewed in the companion paper.’ Relaxing this
assumption would expand the applicability of the
model; for this reason I call attention to each use of
linearity in the analysis and indicate the extent to
which it might be dispensable while still preserving
the core of the approach.
Nothing has been said about U(x) itself. Apart from
using n to denote E(U(x)), nothing will; it will be seen
to be irrelevant to decision making.
COST OF MEASUREMENT

Intuitively, one would expect that measuring blood
pressure, by providing more information about the
patient, would lead to a better decision about treatment. Nevertheless, such information comes at a price.
Time, personnel, equipment, records, and space are
allocated to it (for which the patient incurs a charge),
and the patient must give up work or leisure time for
the encounter, and expend time and resources on
travel. The patient will attach some utility cost to these
events. As with the impact of treatment, I do not propose to analyze how these various burdens combine
to create the utility cost. I simply assume that it is
possible to elicit from the patient the utility cost, C,
of having a blood pressure measurement, with all that
entails.
In this article, a patient’s determination of C is treated
as constant from one occasion to the next. This simplifies the notation, but nothing in the analysis depends on it. By contrast, I explicitly and crucially assume
that C does not depend on x. Based on the explanation
of the constituents of C in the previous paragraph, I
believe this assumption is very reasonable.
There is, however, a second encumbrance associated with measurement not considered above. Although the first measurement can be obtained at once,
equation 1 will be satisfied by subsequent measurements only if enough time passes between them that
long-term determinants of blood pressure can vary.
Subsequent measurements, if any, entail delaying the
treatment decision. The effects of delaying will depend
on the ultimate treatment decision and the true blood
pressure. For those who are ultimately not treated, the
delay has no effect at all: they continue to receive no
treatment throughout. In an ultimately treated severe
hypertensive, the delay will defer, and thereby reduce,
the benefits of treatment. In a person with below-cutoff

blood pressure who might &dquo;mistakenly&dquo; be assigned
to treatment, the delay attenuates the harm that would
be done, and constitutes a net benefit. In any case, it
seems appropriate to model the effect of a delay as a
reduction in the impact (favorable or unfavorable, as
the case may be) that a decision to treat would have
for the patient. One way to model the delay is by
reducing the parameter L. Let a denote the decrease
in L attributable to delaying the treatment decision for
those who will ultimately be treated. Then,

delay)

As with C, the presentation here treats a patient’s a
as constant from one occasion to the next, a notational
convenience not relied upon in the analysis. Also, the

analysis to be presented could proceed just as well
with other formulations of the delay effect, e.g., multiplying L by some constant less than 1. I am aware
of no research results supporting any particular model
of this effect. The essential point is that L is effectively
reduced by delaying.
It is convenient to refer to the totality of assumptions
about distributions and utilities made as the conjugate-normal linear (CNL) model.

and answering it will prove useful later. If measurement were not an option, two strategies, TREAT and NO
would be available. This restricted choice is diain the top two branches of figure 1. For a
patient with true blood pressure x, EU(NO TREAT(x) =
U(x) and EU(TREATlx)
U(x) + L(x - q). Not knowing x,
we take expectations over the probability distribution
of x in equation 2. The linear form of L(x - q) makes
this simple. EU(NO TREAT) = n; EU(TREAT) = n +
L~ ( ~, q). It follows that TREAT is preferred if R > q, NO
TREAT is preferred if R < q, and the patient is indifferent

u3.) For more complicated functions, the
of
suitability this approach depends on the ease of
calculating what value of R demarcates the decision
between TREAT and NO TREAT when measurement is
not being considered.
Let us now assess the option of taking a single measurement. We will incur a cost C, but we will gain
information. The value of that information can be ascertained by comparing the expected utility of a decision made after the measurement with one made
without it. This is precisely the principle used to deduce the thresholds for prior disease probability in
the discrete setting.’ If we choose the measurement
option, the result y will be related to x as in equation
1. Subsequently, our probability distribution for x is
modified in accordance with Bayes’ theorem, as set

Based on the earlier discussion, if R’ turns out to exceed q, the patient will prefer TREAT; if ~,’

prefer NO TREAT. Thus, if we were to make our treatment decision after one measurement the expected
utility would be:

R appreciably less than q would warrant treatment.
Depending on the form of the function, the optimal

cannot be totally waived. Nevertheless, any monotone

Accordingly, the decision among TREAT, NO TREAT,
and MEASURE, diagrammed in figure 1, can be made in
accordance with equations 5 and 11. Let V(J.L, 0’2, r, q,
L, C) denote
z~.4J( - z~)] C. The preferred course of action is TREAT, NO TREAT,
or MEASURE according to which of S2, n + L - (ii - q) or
S2 + V(11, Q2, r, q, L, C) is largest. As promised, the
common term S2 appears in all three expected utilities
and therfore U(x) contributes nothing to the decision.
Notice that the necessary calculations can be done
with a hand calculator and a table of the standard
normal distribution.
It can be proven that the expression for EU(MEAUSRE)
has certain properties that would be expected from
its application here. Viewed as a function of r or U2
alone, it is monotone increasing. Viewed as a function
of [L, it is symmetric around q. If C were 0, EU(MEASURE)
would asymptotically approach the utilities of NO TREAT
and TREAT for very low or very high values of Vt, respectively. The last property can be grasped visually
from figure 2.
In reality, C > 0. This corresponds to a downward
shift in the graph of V. If C is sufficiently large, MEASURE
will be dominated by TREAT and NO TREAT for all values
of (JL. That is, a sufficiently expensive measurement will
not be worthwhile for any value of Vt. In this case, the
single threshold value R q separates two regions: a
TREAT-preferred region ()JL > q) and a No TREAT-preferred region ()JL < q).
On the other hand, for sufficiently small values of
C > 0, there are two threshold values of R, RIO and Rhi)
where the graph of EU(MEASURE) intersects the graphs
of EU(NO TREAT) and EU(TREAT), respectively. If pL < ~.~,;o,
NO TREAT is preferred. If )JL >
~Lhi, TREAT is preferred.
For R between these thresholds, MEASURE is the most
favored course of action.
The findings of the last paragraph suggest comparison with threshold decision making for the discrete
case. The thresholds RIO and [Lhi are analogous to the
Pauker and Kassirer2thesholds in demarcating ranges
corresponding to three options. But lilo and Rhi are
values of the mean of the prior distribution of x; they
are not prior probabilities of disease. Threshold disease probabilities are closely related: the test threshold, Tt = 4J( (pLi~ - q)/u) and the test-treat threshold,

Care should be taken to distinguish the decision
making thresholds /J-Io and jjLhi from the cutoff value q.
The cutoff value q is the point of indifference between
treatment and non-treatment in terms of the latent
blood pressure. Its value is determined from patient
preferences prior to making any decisions. The threshold /J-’s are derived values with which the current
estimate (JL is compared in order to reach a choice

A sequential decision-making procedure may be divided into two components: a rule for deciding whether
to obtain another measurement or not (stopping rule),
and a rule for choosing between TREAT and NO TREAT
once a decision to stop measuring has been reached
(decision rule). It can be shown that an optimal sequential decision-making procedure must use a decision rule that would be optimal if used under
conditions prohibiting measurements.6 In this context
the optimal choice is TREAT if )JL > q, No TREAT otherwise. It remains to propose a stopping rule.
We have considered whether to obtain a single measurement. Subsequently, because the posterior distribution of x is still assumed normal, all of the
relationships among the variables described remain
essentially the same. There are new, updated values
for ii, Q2, and hence for r. The delay effects referred
to earlier also necessitate reducing L by a at each turn.
The form of the problem is otherwise unchanged. We
can iterate the same analysis using the new parameter
values. That is, we can use the following stopping rule:
continue to obtain measurements until EU(MEASURE),
as calculated by equation 11 with current parameter
values, is less than both EU(TREAT) and EU(NO TREAT).
An immediate question to pose about any proposed
stopping rule is: are we guaranteed to eventually stop?
We can answer affirmatively. It can be proven that
given the initial values of 0’2 and r, and a sequence of’
values Cn (the cost of the n’th measurement, heretofore a constant C), and Ln (the slope of the utility gain
from treatment-latent blood pressure line after n 1 delays, heretofore modeled as L - [n - ilot), an upper

introduced a fourth option: measure and then re-measure. Our stopping rule requires us to stop as soon as
an immediate decision has greater utility than one
based on the very next measurement. This rule undervalues measurement by crediting only its impact
on an immediate decision; it overlooks the possibility
that a decision based on two or three more measurements might be preferable to an immediate decision
even though a decision based on one measurement
is worse. Clearly this could happen if the cost of successive measurements decreases.
Perhaps surprisingly, it can also happen when the
cost of successive measurements remains constant. A
complete analysis of this phenomenon is complicated
and cannot be presented here. On a heuristic level,
the value of n > 1 measurements is derived analogously to that of 1 with Rn = n - r/[l + (n &horbar; l)r] playing

would reveal that for suitable r and small n, the expression increases faster than linearly in n, but for large n
it tapers off, being bounded above by the expected
utility of perfect information. Therefore, it is possible
for several measurements to be advantageous when a
single one alone is not.
This observation is somewhat disappointing. But I
take comfort in four facts. 1) Attempts to find a globally
optimal strategy that overcomes this limitation repeatedly lead to recurrence equations I cannot solve.
DeGroot’ provides an extensive discussion of deciding
whether the mean of a normal distribution exceeds a
critical value under linear loss. That abstract decision
problem is a minor simplification of what has been
undertaken here. DeGroot proves that a globally optimal stopping rule for this problem exists. In fact,
given our guarantee of stopping, it can, in principle,
be constructed by a method known as backwards induction. In practice, however, DeGroot notes that &dquo;it
does not seem possible to develop an explicit expression for the [globally] optimal sequential decision procedure.&dquo;6
(p. 286) 2) Extensive numerical
experimentation with the current model has persuaded me that the suboptimality of the stepwise approach occurs only for values of ltn within about 1
mmHg of ~hi,n or J.Llo.nand, relative to the differences
in utility among the three strategies, the incremental
utility achievable by multiple measurements when the
current model recommends stopping is very small,
typically around 1%. 3) As illustrated in the companion
paper, in practice this model implies that many patients ought to receive a longer series of blood pressure
measurements prior to diagnosis than is currently recommended.’ Since this stepwise optimal rule errs only
in failing to recommend measurement when it might
be beneficial, my conclusions about current practices
are, if anything, too conservative. Finally, 4) the discrete threshold decision-making model when applied
sequentially exhibits the same behavior (see appendix

B).

of this model not merely to consider a comparison of
a fixed 1 vs. 2 vs. 3, etc., observations per measurement
strategy but also to determine the optimal number of
observations for any given measurement, which might
(and does’) vary from patient to patient or visit to visit.
When observations cluster in time, so that long-acting sources of blood pressure measurement variability
(dietary influences, fluid and cation balances, plugs of
cerumen in the clinician’s ears, etc.) do not fluctuate,
equation 1 does not apply. If x is the latent blood
pressure, and if d denotes the net effect of the longacting sources of variability, then a series of observations obtained while d remains essentially constant

Equations 18 and 19 establish that y is indeed a

(Q2 + 82)/(O&dquo;z + 82 + EZ), denoted s. This suggests that the
apparatus already in place to determine the expected

utility of a measurement can be used to determine the
expected utility of additional observations if we express the utilities of the TREAT and ~ro TREAT options
in terms of w instead of x.

influential factors that change between but not within

influences is admittedly somewhat artificial. Clinical
practice effectively defines long-term as more than a
week or two.3 The validity of this is an open empirical

thing.&dquo;
To complete the homology with the analysis of independent measurements, we need only handle a and

question.
We began by assuming

that yi is normally distributed. Allow me to assume that x, d, and ei are stochastically independent. Assuming d and ei
independent I find reasonable, though not axiomatic;
assuming d and x independent I find compelling; but
to my knowledge neither question has been studied
empirically. Now, a theorem of H. Kramerl5 implies
that, unless one of them is constant, both w and ei
are themselves both normally distributed. Because w
is normally distributed, d
w - x is normally distributed too. Letting 8’ denote the variance of d, and

argument for f.L~ 00 follows from symmetry.
Another useful fact is:

increasing function of f.L. Proof Differentiate V with respect

This is necessarily less than 0. So V is a decreasing function of zq, and therefore an increasing function
of f.L.. By the way, one can use the formula for dV/dzq just
given to calculate dV/dr using the chain rule. From this one
can prove that V is an increasing function of r, all other
arguments held constant.
Theorem: W is a bounded function of pt, and it attains its
maximum value when q

that max (0, L(f.L - q))

for any )JL < q. But W is also symmetric about q. Therefore,
if f.L > q, let f.L* = q - (W-q). Then W(f.L) W(>*) < W(q). 0
Before proceeding to prove our stopping theorem, we note
some implications of these theorems for the model. If measurement were free, it would always be the strategy of choice.
But because the gain from measurement approaches 0 for
large values of R, the imposition of a cost C > 0 ensures that
measurement will not be preferred if R is sufficiently far
from q. (We are not dealing with a change in L associated
with measurement here.) If C is large enough, we will have
W(q) < C, in which case measurement is not preferred for
any value of R (since W(q) is the largest value W attains). But
if W(q) > C, it follows that for values of R sufficiently close
to q, measurement will be preferred. Because W increases
for R < q and decreases for ~L > q, it follows that there will
be unique thresholds pL1~; and lilo where W(w,,;) = W(f.Llo) =
C, pL1~; > q > ~Ll.. These thresholds would demarcate the
boundary between TREAT and MEASURE or MEASURE and NO
TREAT, respectively. The further imposition of a delay effect
such as the one described in the text complicates matters
only slightly. If the reader is interested, it is a simple exercise
to supply the details.
We next remind the reader of some standard mathematical notation. Given two sequences An and Bn, we write An
O(Bn) if for some constant K >- 0 and some N ~ 0, we have
An:5 K. Bn whenever n > N. It is sometimes said that &dquo;An
o(Bn)
grows with order at most Bn.&dquo; We also say that An
if An/Bn ~ 0 as n - 00. Notice that saying An
0(1) is the
same as saying that An ~ 0 as n approaches 00. The &dquo;o&dquo;

APPENDIX B

Stepwise Non-global Optimality

in the Discrete Case

appendix, the discrepancy between the stepwise
decision making calculated by iterating a one-step
decision rule and globally optimal decision making is explored for discrete disease states and test results. A full
formal analysis of this phenomenon involves tedious computation. Instead, I will show that the standard analysis of
no treat-test-treat decisions for discrete tests and outcomes
can exhibit similar irregularity, identify qualitatively the relationships among the parameters that conspire to produce
this irregularity, and point out how similar phenomena are
at work in the continuous model.
When there are only two outcomes, disease vs. no disease,
and two test results, positive vs. negative, the decision whether
to use the test or not is analyzed as follows. Let B denote
the benefit conferred by treating diseased people, H the
harm conferred by treating non-diseased people, p the prior
probability (prevalence, if need be) of disease, I the sensitivity of the test, 0 the specificity of the test, and C the cost
of the test. It is well known that the decision depends only
upon these parameters and not on the utilities assigned to
the untreated outcomes of diseased and non-diseased people. Using the expected utility of deciding NOT to treat as a
baseline, the expected GAIN in utility from treatment is pB (1- p)H (which can be negative). The expected gain in utility
over the same baseline from testing and then treating positive results is pIB - (1 - p) (1 - 8m - C.
Suppose that p 0.6, 1 0.25, 8 = 0.99, B H 1, and
C
0.02. Values such as these might arise, for example, in
evaluating an intravenous drug user with a tender, swollen
wrist who is mildly febrile. The diagnostic concern is gramnegative septic arthritis, but attempted arthrocentesis has
failed and the patient will not consent to an open procedure.
B, representing the avoidance of a permanently ankylosed
wrist joint, might reasonably be equated to H, an unnecIn this

essary, long hospitalization receiving nephrotoxic antibiotics
intravenously through central catheters with their attendant
complications. Diagnostic information might be obtained
from a blood culture. Blood cultures rarely grow gram-negative organisms (as contaminants) when a patient has acute
gout or cellulitis, but could, with low probability, detect the
intermittent bacteremia associated with gram-negative septic arthritis.
Using these values, the utility of treating is 0.2 greater than
that of not treating. The utility of testing is only 0.126 greater
than that of not treating. The optimal decision is therefore
to treat without testing.
But if we consider the possibility of doing multiple blood
cultures the picture changes. Conditional on disease status,
the results of several blood cultures would be more or less
independent if they were spaced at intervals of several hours.
If n blood cultures are ordered, and if we interpret the series
as positive if any one is positive,* then the overall sensitivity
of the battery is 1 - (1&horbar;~)&dquo;, and the overall specificity is
6°. The cost, assuming additive utilities, is nC. We now find
that a battery of two tests has an expected utility that is
0.21454 greater than baseline. This makes a battery of two
tests preferable to any of the previously considered strategies. In fact, a little calculation shows that ordering seven
tests would be the optimal strategy (with expected utility
approximately 0.353 over baseline), despite the fact that the

*Expected utility calculations with these test parameters show
that this method of interpreting a series of blood cultures is preferable to other decision rules.

stepwise-best solution is

to order no test at all!
What accounts for this paradoxical result? The key facts
are that the sensitivity of the test is poor, the specificity is
excellent, and the test is cheap. Whereas the sensitivity of
the test is so low that performing it once is not worth even
its meager cost, iterating the test produces, at least initially,
major improvement in sensitivity with negligible loss of specificity. The additional cost of the first several repetitions is
small compared with the added value of the information
gained. Eventually, in this case after the seventh test, further
improvements in sensitivity are minor and are outweighed
by the fixed additional cost of the test. (Also, at this point
the deterioration in specificity becomes appreciable as well.)
The phenomenon arises, then, from the large marginal gains
that can be had from iterating a low-quality test a small
number of times at a fixed, relatively small cost.
Similar considerations apply to the continuous model. At
the point where the stepwise optimal strategy fails to be
globally optimal, the parameter r, which captures the operating characteristics of the test, is rather low. Iterating the
measurement a few times and using the average result produces substantial increases in r with a corresponding gain
in utility outweighing the relatively small additional cost.
(Unlike the disjunctive interpretation of a discrete test, averaged interpretation of continuous test results improves
both the sensitivity and the specificity of the test with respect
to any dichotomization of the range of the underlying true
variable, so the effect of repetition is even stronger than in
the discrete model.) Evenutally, however, the marginal improvement in r decreases and the corresponding marginal
increase in utility falls below the fixed increment in cost.
