Although scholars and practitioners have repeatedly touted the importance of negotiating effectively
across cultures, paradoxically, little research has addressed what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. In this research, we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on intercultural negotiation processes and outcomes, controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive ability and emotional
intelligence), personality (openness and extraversion), and international experience. Transcripts of 124
American and East Asian negotiators were coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors
and cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a week prior to negotiations
predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative information behaviors, which in turn
predicted joint proﬁt, over and beyond other individual differences. Additional analyses revealed that
the level of integrative sequencing was more a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring
negotiator within the dyad. Other individual difference characteristics were not related to effective intercultural negotiation processes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Introduction
The concern for negotiating effectively across cultures is hardly
a new phenomenon. Even the world’s ﬁrst historian, Herodotus (ca.
400BC) observed the ‘‘strangeness” of how ancient Egyptians
traded with the Greeks (Herodotus, Marincola, & de Selincourt,
2003), and as early as the second century BC, trade began to ﬂourish among people of different cultures along the Silk Road that
stretched from Rome to China (Elisseeff, 2000). In the 21st century,
with the advent of globalization, being able to negotiate effectively
across cultures is a crucial aspect of many inter-organizational
relationships, including strategic alliances, joint ventures, mergers
and acquisitions, licensing and distribution agreements, and sales
of products and services (Adler, 2002). The need to negotiate effectively across cultures is also painfully obvious in today’s geo-political scene, where the source of conﬂict among humankind is
thought to be increasingly cultural in nature (Huntington, 1996).
Indeed, in the recent Iraq Study Group Report, the improvement of
cultural training for US personnel ﬁghting the war in Iraq was
deemed one of the highest priorities by the US secretary of state,
secretary of defense, and the director of national intelligence (Baker & Hamilton, 2006).
Despite the importance of being able to negotiate effectively
across cultures, there is a fundamental paradox in the culture

and negotiation literature. That is, even though the practical
importance of negotiating across cultural boundaries is often touted to justify cross-cultural theory development, the vast majority
of research on culture and negotiation remains comparative (e.g.
Gelfand & Realo, 1999; Tinsley & Pillutla, 1998). With some exceptions (Adair, Okumura, & Brett, 2001; Adler & Graham, 1989; Brett
& Okumura, 1998; Natlandsmyr & Rognes, 1995), most research
compares and contrasts different negotiation behaviors as they occur in mono-cultural contexts across cultures, instead of directly
examining intercultural settings where cultural barriers exist right
at the negotiation table. Indeed, in reviewing Gelfand and Brett’s
(2004) Handbook of Negotiation and Culture, Kray (2005) aptly lamented that ‘‘although researchers have identiﬁed a host of
cross-cultural differences in styles and preferences, negotiation
scholars might consider expanding beyond simple demonstrations
of differences. . .and explore whether awareness of these differences makes a difference. . .knowledge about factors inﬂuencing
the effectiveness of intercultural negotiations is sparse” (p. 159).
Yet to date, the culture and negotiation literature reveals little as
to what characteristics negotiators can be selected and/or trained
upon in order to maximize the chances of reaching optimal agreements in intercultural negotiations.
The purpose of this research is to examine cultural intelligence
(CQ), deﬁned as an individual’s capability to adapt effectively to
situations of cultural diversity (Earley & Ang, 2003), as a potential
predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Our main proposition is that negotiators with higher CQ have more cooperative

motives and higher epistemic motivation in intercultural contexts
(study 1), and will engage in more effective integrative negotiation
processes (i.e., reciprocal and complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors), which will allow them to
achieve higher joint proﬁts than dyads with lower CQ (study 2).
We take a conservative approach and examine whether CQ predicts effective sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors over
and beyond other forms of individual difference characteristics
identiﬁed in the negotiation literature to have an impact on integrative negotiation. We also examine the dyad composition of CQ
and propose that the level of integrative sequencing achieved
among dyads will be no greater than that determined by the lower-scoring negotiator within the dyad. To the best of our knowledge, this research is of the ﬁrst to directly address the question
of what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness.

Intercultural challenges to effective integrative negotiation
processes and outcomes
The culture and negotiation literature has consistently found
that negotiators achieve signiﬁcantly less joint proﬁt when negotiating across the cultural divide than when negotiating within their
own culture. This effect has been found among various samples
(e.g., Adler & Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998; Natlandsmyr
& Rognes, 1995), and the robustness of this intercultural disadvantage is not surprising when considering the number of psychological and behavioral challenges that face negotiators in intercultural
contexts (see Adair & Brett, 2004).
In terms of psychological challenges, negotiators in intercultural contexts are less likely to have cooperative motives (i.e., have
equal and high concerns for both the outcomes of self and other)
than negotiators in intracultural contexts. For example, the intergroup bias literature has long established that individuals are less
willing to extend cooperation towards outgroup members compared to ingroup members (Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002). Indeed, an early negotiation study by Graham (1985) found that
intercultural negotiators are more competitive than intracultural
negotiators (see also George, Jones, & Gonzalez, 1999; Kumar,
2004). Intercultural negotiations are also more challenging in that
they have the potential to promote negative intergroup dynamics
that lead to the closing of the mind among negotiators. For example, negative moods such as anxiety and fear that commonly arise
in intercultural situations (Stephan & Stephan, 1985) have been
shown to lower cognitive ﬂexibility (Baas, De Dreu, & Nijstad,
2008). Similarly, ethnocentrism has been found to be associated
with rigidity in thinking (Cunningham, Nezlek, & Banaji, 2004). Together, these ﬁndings suggest that in intercultural contexts, negotiators may have a more difﬁcult time sustaining epistemic
motivation (i.e., the need to develop an accurate understanding of
the world through deliberate and systematic information processing (De Dreu, 2004) than in intracultural contexts. The fact that
both cooperative motives and epistemic motivation are difﬁcult
to maintain in intercultural contexts is problematic, as the broader
literature shows that both are necessary for negotiators to engage
in effective integrative behaviors that lead to joint proﬁt (De Dreu,
Beersma, Stroebe, & Euwema, 2006; see also Beersma & De Dreu,
1999; De Dreu & Van Lange, 1995; De Dreu, Weingart, & Kwon,
2000; Olekalns, Smith, & Kibby, 1996; Weingart, Bennett, & Brett,
1993).
Furthermore, behavioral challenges such as coordination problems and communication mismatches are more likely to afﬂict
intercultural negotiators. Research suggests that negotiators from
different cultures bring culture-speciﬁc schemas (Brett & Okumura, 1998; Gelfand et al., 2001) and behavioral strategies (Adair

et al., 2001) to the negotiation table. For example, Adair et al.
(2001) found that while negotiators from a low context culture
such as the US exchange information directly through stating issue
priorities, negotiators from a high context culture such as Japan exchange information indirectly by implying their own issue priorities through the use of multi-issue offers. Such cultural
differences in normative negotiation behaviors suggest that in
intercultural contexts, negotiators may have a more difﬁcult time
engaging in effective, coordinated sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors than in intracultural contexts. This particular intercultural challenge is problematic given the broader negotiation
literature shows that sequencing of integrative negotiation behaviors, whether it is reciprocal sequencing of integrative tactics (i.e.,
matching identical negotiation tactics; Adair, 2003; Olekalns &
Smith, 2000; Weingart, Prietula, Hyder, & Genovese, 1999; Weingart, Thompson, Bazerman, & Carroll, 1990) or complementary
sequencing of integrative tactics (i.e., pairing non-identical integrative tactics; Olekalns & Smith, 2003), is a critical predictor of high
joint proﬁt.
In summary, the lack of cooperativeness and epistemic motivation associated with interacting with culturally unfamiliar others
and the coordination problems that result from clashing behavioral
styles make intercultural negotiators less likely to engage in integrative negotiation processes that lead to joint proﬁt. A natural
question that arises then is: how can negotiators overcome such
obstacles? What individual difference characteristic might best
predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness?

Cultural intelligence (CQ)
In this research, we consider a broad range of individual difference characteristics, including cultural intelligence, cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, openness, extraversion, and
international experience. Actual practices of how American ﬁrms
select individuals for overseas assignments suggest that technical
job-related experience and job-related skills are the two most
important criteria to consider (Moran & Boyer, 1987; as discussed
in Black, Mendenhall, and Oddou (1991)). Considering that cognitive ability has consistently been shown to be a valid predictor of
job performance (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998), could it predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness? Or might emotional intelligence
(Salovey & Mayer, 1990), a more interpersonally relevant ability of
being able to accurately process others’ emotions?
While we examine such possibilities, we argue that cultural
intelligence (CQ), deﬁned as a person’s capability to successfully
adapt to new cultural settings (Earley & Ang, 2003) is likely a more
powerful predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Our
reasoning (as elaborated in Earley and Ang (2003)) is that while
constructs such as cognitive ability and emotional intelligence
may help negotiators to process certain types of information, such
advantages may not be necessarily helpful for facilitating social
interaction speciﬁcally in intercultural contexts. For example, cognitive ability allows one to reason, solve problems, and think abstractly in general (Gottfredson, 1997), yet it does not necessarily
entail effective processing of interpersonally relevant information.
Furthermore, while emotional intelligence enables one to accurately appraise other’s emotions and react appropriately, it does
not guarantee that it familiarizes individuals to culture-speciﬁc
systems of emotional expression. Indeed, there is empirical support in the culture and emotion literature for the dialect theory
of communicating emotion (see Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002,
2003; Elfenbein, Beaupre, Levesque, & Hess, 2007), which states
that while there are universal aspects to expressing emotion, there
are also substantive cultural differences which pose challenges for
accurate recognition of emotions across cultural boundaries. This is

consistent with anecdotes among international HR managers, who
observe that the level of interpersonal skills employees possess
within a culture is independent from the level of interpersonal
skills those employees possess across cultures (Earley & Ang,
2003). In other words, just because an individual may possess high
interpersonal skills within his or her own culture, this may not
necessarily translate into being able to adjust easily and quickly
to people and situations across new cultural contexts. At the same
time, an individual who appears to be lacking interpersonal skills
within his or her own culture may still be able to adjust easily
and quickly to new cultural contexts (Earley & Ang, 2003).
In response to this need of understanding individual differences
in cultural adaptation, Earley and Ang (2003) conceptualized CQ as
a multi-faceted characteristic consisting of meta-cognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral components. The meta-cognitive
facet of CQ refers to an individual’s level of cultural mindfulness
or awareness during intercultural interactions (Ang & Van Dyne,
2008). Individuals with high meta-cognitive CQ engage in higherorder cognitive processes when trying to adapt to new cultures,
including how to plan learning about the new culture as well as
evaluating and monitoring their own progress. Cognitive CQ refers
to an individual’s acquired knowledge of similarities and differences regarding norms, practices, and conventions of other cultures (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Motivational CQ refers to an
individual’s ability to direct attention and energy toward adapting
to new cultures. More speciﬁcally, motivational CQ refers to intrinsic motivation and self-efﬁcacy in adapting to new cultures. Thus,
individuals with high motivational CQ enjoy interacting in new
cultures and feel conﬁdent about their own abilities in doing so
(Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Finally, behavioral CQ refers to the extent
to which individuals possess a wide repertoire of behavioral skills,
and can appropriately enact verbal as well as non-verbal behaviors
in new cultural settings (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008).
Empirical research has shown that CQ is an important predictor
of affective as well as performance-related outcomes in culturally
diverse situations, over and beyond a number of other constructs.
For example, Ang et al. (2007) found that individuals with higher
CQ are able to make more accurate cultural judgments and report
greater interactional adjustment and well-being than those with
lower CQ, over and beyond cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, personality, and international experience. In organizational
contexts, the same authors found that international managers with
higher CQ performed better on an intercultural business task, controlling for cognitive ability and international experience. Moreover, in a sample of foreign professionals, Ang et al. (2007) found
that CQ predicts higher job performance as rated by their supervisors, over and beyond international experience. In another study,
Templer, Tay, and Chandrasekar (2006) found that expatriates with
higher CQ experienced greater cross-cultural adjustment than
those with lower CQ, taking into account the realistic previews of
the job and living conditions expatriates received, time in host
country, and prior international experience. More recent empirical
investigations have found that CQ is negatively related to burnout
among business travelers working in multinational corporations
(Tay, Westman, & Chia, 2008), and positively related to how
quickly employees are integrated into multicultural work teams
(Flaherty, 2008).
While CQ has been studied among a wide variety of contexts, it
has not been studied yet in the domain of negotiations. In the sections that follow, we argue that CQ provides negotiators with the
capability to overcome the psychological and behavioral challenges that impede effective integrative negotiation processes that
lead to joint proﬁt. We do so by ﬁrst proposing that CQ equips individuals in general with cooperative motives and epistemic motivation that are the psychological pre-requisites that help overcome
intercultural behavioral hurdles in negotiation contexts. As such,

we test the inter-relationships between CQ and each of these constructs (study 1). We also examine whether higher CQ negotiators
engage in more effective integrative negotiation processes in terms
of their actual behaviors at a micro level of analysis (i.e., sequences
of integrative negotiation behaviors) and thereby achieve higher
joint proﬁt than lower CQ negotiators, over and beyond other individual difference characteristics (study 2). Finally, also in study 2,
we examine an issue pertaining to dyad composition; that is,
whether the level of integrative sequencing between negotiators
is more a function of the lower CQ or the higher CQ negotiator
within the dyad.
Study 1: CQ, cooperative motives, and epistemic motivation
We reason that individuals with higher CQ have greater cooperative motives as well as higher epistemic motivation than individuals with lower CQ. By deﬁnition, individuals with higher CQ
genuinely enjoy interacting with people from different cultures.
As such, in culturally diverse situations, individuals with higher
CQ are more likely to approach the situation with a cooperative
mindset and less likely to maintain strong ingroup–outgroup distinctions than individuals with lower CQ. Thus, we argue that individuals with higher CQ will focus on building more positive
cooperative relationships rather than negative competitive relationships. Indirect support for this notion is evident in several
empirical studies. For example, individuals with higher CQ report
greater interpersonal trust toward culturally different others compared to individuals with lower CQ (Rockstuhl & Ng, 2008). Furthermore, individuals with higher CQ also tend to be more
agreeable (Ang, Van Dyne, & Koh, 2006; Kim, Kirkman, & Chen,
2008), where agreeable individuals are conceptualized to deal with
conﬂict cooperatively, strive for common understanding, and
maintain social afﬁliations (Digman, 1990). Nevertheless, no study
has directly examined the relationship between CQ and cooperative motives.
H1. Individuals with higher CQ will have higher cooperative
motives than individuals with lower CQ.
Further, given that individuals with higher CQ genuinely enjoy
interacting with people from different cultures, it is likely that they
are open-minded, curious, and enjoy learning new things, or in
other words, have higher epistemic motivation. Individuals with
higher CQ are also by deﬁnition highly conﬁdent in adapting to culturally diverse situations; thus, should communication setbacks
arise due to ambiguous cultural cues, these individuals are more
likely to persist and invest great effort into forming an accurate
understanding of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal
of adapting effectively to the intercultural situation. Research
shows indirect evidence for a positive relationship between CQ
and epistemic motivation. Ang et al. (2006) found that CQ is positively correlated with openness to experience, which is a conceptually similar construct to epistemic motivation (Kruglanski, 2004).
H2. Individuals with higher CQ will have higher epistemic motivation than individuals with lower CQ.
In summary, we expect individuals with higher CQ to have
higher cooperative motives as well as epistemic motivation. Indeed, consistent with our predictions, researchers of group decision-making have recently argued that while cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation are orthogonal constructs, certain antecedent states and/or traits should stimulate both (De Dreu, Nijstad,
& van Knippenberg, 2008). As such, we expect CQ to be one such
antecedent trait of both cooperative motives and epistemic
motivation.

Study 1 method
Participants
In order to test our hypotheses, 236 participants were recruited
through market research tools to ﬁll out an online survey. All participants were full-time employees and consisted of 42% females
and 58% males (MAge = 42.1). Most participants were either Caucasian/White (58%) or Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islander (31%), with
the other 11% consisting of African–American/Blacks, Hispanic/
Latinos, American–Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Multi-racial/Multi-ethnics.
Procedure
Through an online market research company, participants were
invited to ﬁll out an online survey examining ‘‘relationships among
individual difference characteristics.” Participants ﬁrst completed
an informed consent form, then took the survey, and were fully debriefed at the end of the survey.
Measures
Cultural intelligence
CQ was assessed with the 20-item Cultural Intelligence Scale
(CQS) by Ang et al. (2007) who demonstrated the scale’s four-factor
structure of the construct, along with other psychometric properties such as factor equivalence, reliability, and temporal stability
(see Appendix A for items). In the present study, the overall CQ
scale had high reliability (a = 0.92), along with its four dimensional
sub-scales: meta-cognitive CQ (a = 0.90), cognitive CQ (a = 0.91),
motivational CQ (a = 0.89), and behavioral CQ (a = 0.90). All items
were measured on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
scale.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to conﬁrm the
dimensionality of the 20 CQ items. Specifying a model where the
four meta-cognitive items, six cognitive items, ﬁve motivational
items and ﬁve behavioral items load onto their corresponding CQ
facets, and where all CQ facets load onto an overall CQ construct,
the model had sufﬁcient ﬁt (v2[166] = 421.82 p = .00; CFI = 0.91;
SRMR = 0.06; RMSEA = 0.08), although some of the ﬁt indices were
slightly below the criteria cutoffs suggested by Hu and Bentler
(1999).
Cooperative motives
Cooperative motives were measured by assessing the extent to
which individuals intended to rely on cooperative heuristics in
negotiation situations. Cooperative negotiation heuristics were
measured with eight items taken from De Dreu and Boles (1998).
Participants were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed
with statements concerning negotiations such as, ‘‘share and share
alike” and ‘‘lying never pays.” All items were measured on a 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale and the overall scale
had good reliability (a = 0.78).
We also measured cooperative motives as prosocial value orientation with nine decomposed games (c.f. Messick & McClintock,
1968) taken from Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, and Joireman
(1997). In a decomposed game, participants are presented with
three different distributions of outcomes (i.e., points) between
themselves and a hypothetical ‘‘other” and are asked to choose
one from competitive, individualistic, and cooperative (or prosocial) options. For example, participants could be asked to choose
from option A (480 points for self and 80 points for other), option
B (540 points for self and 280 points for other), and option C (480
points for self and 480 points for other). In this example, option A

would represent the competitive choice, given there is a maximum
difference
between
one’s
own
and
other’s
outcome
(480 80 = 400) compared to option B (540 280 = 260) or option
C (480 480 = 0). In contrast, option C would represent the cooperative choice, given there is a minimum difference between one’s
own and other’s outcome. Option B would represent the individualistic choice because 540 points is the greatest number of points
for the self compared to option A (480) or option C (480), regardless of how many points the other received.
In this study, based on participants’ responses across the 9
decomposed games, individuals were classiﬁed as competitive,
individualistic, or cooperative if they had made at least six consistent choices for one of the three categories (1 = competitive;
2 = individualistic; 3 = cooperative). Fifty-four percent of participants were classiﬁed as cooperative, 23% as individualistic, and
8% as competitive. 15% were unclassiﬁable as they endorsed less
than six consistent outcome choices. Classiﬁed participants were
then further categorized dichotomously as to whether they were
cooperative or not cooperative (i.e., competitive or individualistic).
In terms of reliability, decomposed games have been shown in previous studies to have good internal consistency and test–retest
reliability (Kuhlman, Camac, & Cunha, 1986; Van Lange & SeminGoossens, 1998).
Epistemic motivation
As per De Dreu et al. (2006) and Kruglanski and Thompson
(1999), epistemic motivation was assessed by measuring need
for cognition as well as need for closure. The need for cognition
scale consisted of 18 items from Cacioppo, Petty, and Kao (1984).
Participants were asked to answer items such as, ‘‘I prefer my life
to be ﬁlled with puzzles that I must solve” and ‘‘I really enjoy a task
that involves coming up with new solutions to problems.” The
need for cognition scale had high reliability (a = 0.88). All items
were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) scale.
Epistemic motivation was also measured with Roets and van
Hiel’s (2007) adapted version of Kruglanski, Webster and Klem’s
(1993) 42-item need for closure scale (NFCS), where high need
for closure indicates low epistemic motivation. Given recent criticisms against the validity of the decisiveness sub-scale of the NFCS,
Roets and Van Hiel’s (2007) version substitutes the seven original
decisiveness items of the NFCS with six new items, forming a 41item scale overall. This scale had high reliability (a = 0.88). All
items were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree)
scale.
Demographic variables
A number of demographic variables were measured: sex (0 = female; 1 = male), age (years), Non-US citizen status (0 = no; 1 = yes),
and race (1 = Caucasian; 2 = African–American/Black; 3 = American–Indian/Alaskan Native; 4 = Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islander;
5 = Hispanic/Latino; 6 = Multi-racial/Multi-ethnic; 7 = Other). Given low frequencies for some categories of race, race was recoded
into a trichotomy (1 = Caucasian; 2 = Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islander; 3 = Other).
Study 1 results and discussion
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of CQ (at the overall
and facet levels), cooperative motives, and epistemic motivation,
along with the partial correlations conducted among the measures
of these constructs in order to test both hypotheses. Demographic
variables including age, sex, US citizen status, and two dummy
codes representing the three most frequent categories of race (Caucasian, Asian–American, Other) were controlled for in the analyses,
resulting in a sample size of 195 for all partial correlations. Overall,

the correlational analysis shows that while cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation are unrelated, CQ has signiﬁcant relationships with both cooperative motives and epistemic motivation,
respectively.
As predicted, in Hypothesis 1 overall CQ had a positive correlation with cooperative motives as measured by negotiation heuristics (r(188) = .19, p < .01). Individuals who have greater ability in
adapting to situations of cultural diversity also tend to want to behave more cooperatively in negotiations, compared to individuals
who have lower ability in adapting to situations of cultural diversity. Notably, at the facet level, motivational CQ had the strongest
positive correlation with cooperative negotiation heuristics
(r(188) = .27, p < .01). Overall CQ was not signiﬁcantly correlated
with prosocial value orientation (r(188) = .04, p > .50), but the
motivational facet of CQ was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated
(r(188) = .14, p < .05).1
As predicted, in Hypothesis 2 overall CQ had a positive correlation with epistemic motivation as measured by need for cognition
(r(188) = .19, p < .01). In other words, individuals who have greater
ability in adapting to situations of cultural diversity also tend to
like investing a lot of cognitive effort in general (i.e., developing
an accurate understanding of their surroundings), compared to
individuals who have lower ability in adapting to situations of cultural diversity. At the facet level, motivational CQ had the strongest
positive correlation with need for cognition (r(188) = .24, p < .01).
Overall CQ did not have a signiﬁcant relationship with need for closure (r(188) = .12, p = .10), but further analysis revealed that
motivational CQ had an expected negative correlation
(r(188) = .21, p < .01).
In summary, study 1 shows that individuals with higher CQ are
also more cooperative in general, and possess a greater desire to
develop an accurate understanding of their surroundings compared to individuals with lower CQ. Thus, our preliminary ﬁndings
show evidence that CQ provides negotiators with psychological
characteristics that are beneﬁcial for engaging in effective integrative negotiation processes that lead to joint proﬁt at the intercultural negotiation table. However, it remains to be seen if
negotiators with higher CQ actually engage in effective integrative
negotiation processes at the micro level in terms of their behaviors.
That is, do dyads that consist of higher CQ negotiators engage in
sequencing of integrative negotiation behaviors over and beyond other
individual difference characteristics and thereby achieve higher joint
proﬁt than dyads that consist of lower CQ negotiators?

We also measured cooperative motives by simply counting the number of
cooperative choices made across the nine decomposed games. Correlation analysis
using this measure produced nearly identical results as that reported in Table 1.
Further correlational analyses revealed that there is no signiﬁcant relationship
between (a) CQ and competitive motives and (b) CQ and individualistic motives.

Study 2: CQ and intercultural negotiation effectiveness
We reason that dyads consisting of negotiators with higher CQ
will engage in more effective sequences of integrative information
behaviors than dyads consisting of negotiators with lower CQ.
Being more cooperative, we argue that higher CQ negotiators will
generally adopt more integrative negotiation strategies. Furthermore, we argue that having greater desire and efﬁcacy to adapt
to the culturally diverse negotiation situation, higher CQ negotiators should invest more cognitive effort into accurately understanding their counterparts’ behaviors for their communicative
intentions. In all, we argue that the use of more integrative strategies and the greater investment of cognitive effort of higher CQ
negotiators will translate into more coordinated exchange of information regarding the counterparts’ interests and priorities, resulting in stable sequencing of integrative information behaviors.
H3. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in more sequences of
integrative information behaviors (reciprocal or complementary)
than dyads with lower CQ.
In addition to task-focused integrative information sequences,
we also expect higher CQ dyads will manage the working relationship itself by engaging in more sequences of cooperative comments (e.g. expressions of enthusiasm for working together) that
would reinforce the cooperative context of the negotiation, compared to lower CQ dyads. Focusing on the relational aspect of integrative negotiations is just as important as focusing on the taskrelated aspect, given relational processes and outcomes determine
the likelihood of future relationships between negotiators.
H4. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in more sequences of
cooperative relationship management behaviors than dyads with
lower CQ.
While we have formally hypothesized whether CQ as an overall
construct inﬂuences sequences of integrative information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management
behaviors, we explore the relative predictive power of the four facets of CQ. Given that in study 1, motivational CQ was most consistently and strongly correlated with the psychological advantages of
cooperative motives as well as epistemic motivation, it may be that
motivational CQ will also exert the strongest effect in terms of predicting behavioral sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors.
Furthermore, with respect to the inﬂuence of negotiation processes on outcomes, the broader negotiation literature has found
that sequencing integrative negotiation behaviors move negotiators down a cooperative path, and leads to high joint proﬁt (Adair,
2003; Olekalns & Smith, 2000, 2003; Weingart et al., 1990, 1999).
For example, Olekalns and Smith (2000) found that dyads that engage in frequent reciprocal sequencing of priority information are
more likely to reach optimal joint outcomes. However, given that

this literature on communication processes in negotiation has focused mostly on intracultural negotiation contexts, it is important
to replicate these ﬁndings in intercultural negotiation contexts.
H5. Dyads that engage in more sequences of integrative information behaviors (reciprocal or complementary) will achieve higher
joint proﬁt.
H6. Dyads that engage in more sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors will achieve higher joint proﬁt.
Finally, we examine the effects of dyad composition of CQ on sequences, that is, whether the level of sequencing of integrative information behaviors and cooperative relationship management
behaviors is more a function of the high CQ negotiator or the low
CQ negotiator within the dyad. Given that sequencing is a conjunctive
task (Steiner, 1972) in which contributions from both negotiators
are required for high performance, we expect that a dyad’s level of
sequencing depends on the lowest level of CQ within the dyad, or
in other words, the ‘‘weakest link.” Put simply, even if one negotiator
possesses high CQ, as long as the other negotiator has low CQ and
does not contribute to the joint activity of reciprocating integrative
as well as cooperative behaviors, the dyad may still suffer as a result.
H7. The level of sequencing of integrative information behaviors
and sequencing of cooperative relationship management behaviors
will be no greater than that determined by the minimum level of
CQ in the dyad.

Other individual difference constructs

tisements at a large public university. The advertisement speciﬁcally targeted either ‘‘American citizens of Western European
descent,” or ‘‘East Asians who have lived in the US for less than
ﬁve years and are originally from China, Japan, or Korea.” The
American sample consisted of 75 individuals (28 males and 47 females; MAge = 26.9), and the East Asian sample also consisted of
75 individuals (28 males and 47 females; MAge = 26.4). Participants were ﬁrst matched on sex and level of education (undergraduate or graduate), and then randomly paired to form 75
intercultural dyads. Within the dyad, participants were randomly
assigned to one of two negotiator roles. Ten dyads had at least
one negotiator who did not give consent to being audio-taped;
thus, these dyads were excluded from analyses with a ﬁnal sample size of 130. All students were given $20 cash cards for
participation.
Procedure
The study took part over two sessions, separated by a minimum
of one week. On the ﬁrst session, participants were asked to ﬁll out
an online questionnaire that assessed all individual difference
characteristics (i.e. cultural intelligence, emotional intelligence,
openness, extraversion, and international experience), except for
cognitive ability which was assessed with a timed-test at the end
of the second session. On the second session, participants were
asked to come into the laboratory to engage in a negotiation simulation. Participants ﬁrst read their role information individually,
then were brought together with their partners from the other culture to engage in a negotiation simulation while being tape-recorded. They were given 20 min to negotiate. After the
negotiation session, both negotiators ﬁlled out a ﬁnal agreement
form that indicated their levels of settlement. Finally, participants
completed a timed-test of cognitive ability, and then were fully
debriefed.

Along with our analysis of CQ, we simultaneously examine if
other individual difference characteristics also predict the abovementioned sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors. One
theoretical limitation of the current individual differences and
negotiation literature is that research has focused exclusively on
intracultural negotiation contexts, and little is known regarding
the potential moderating effects of other types of negotiation contexts on the relationship between negotiator disposition and negotiation processes and outcomes. Furthermore, such a theoretical
limitation is an obvious practical limitation as well, since negotiators need to be selected not only on their dispositional characteristics, but dispositional characteristics that ﬁt the right type of
negotiation. Thus, in our research, we include individual difference
characteristics that have been found or argued to be advantageous
for integrative negotiation in intracultural contexts, and examine if
they predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness.
More speciﬁcally, we examine other forms of intelligence
including cognitive ability (Barry & Friedman, 1998; Fulmer & Barry, 2004; Kurtzberg, 1998) and emotional intelligence (Elfenbein,
Foo, White, Tan, & Aik, 2007; Foo, Elfenbein, Tan, & Aik, 2004; Fulmer & Barry, 2004), as well as personality traits including openness
(Ma & Jaeger, 2005) and extraversion (Barry & Friedman, 1998). Finally, another purpose for including these other individual difference characteristics is to provide a conservative test to see if CQ
predicts sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors over and
beyond the other individual difference characteristics. Thus, we
also include international experience given it is conceptualized to
be highly associated with CQ (see Ang & Van Dyne, 2008).

The negotiation simulation was adapted from Towers Market II
which has been used in previous research on integrative bargaining (e.g. Weingart, Olekalns, & Smith, 2004). This simulation involved a mixed-motive negotiation between a specialty grocery
shop owner and a wine shop owner. Participants were told that a
successful real estate company has proposed developing a multifunctional market that consists of a wine store and a grocery store
under one roof with common décor but with separate areas for
their respective top-quality products. Participants were told that
they were seriously interested in the shared market but needed
to negotiate ﬁve unresolved issues with the other vendor: (1) Hours
of Operation, (2) Renovation Costs, (3) Floor Space, (4) Temperature,
and (5) Grand Opening Date.
Participants were given a payoff schedule that listed the possible levels of settlement on each of the ﬁve negotiation issues, and
the number of points associated with each level of settlement
that indicated the amount of worth of that level of settlement
to the negotiator. The structure of the payoff schedule left room
for integrative potential: Grand Opening Date and Renovation
Costs were integrative issues, Hours of Operation and Temperature were distributive issues, and Floor Space was a compatible
issue.

meta-cognitive CQ (aAmerican = 0.84, aEast Asian = 0.83), cognitive CQ
(aAmerican = 0.80, aEast Asian = 0.78), motivational CQ (aAmerican = 0.86,
aEast Asian = 0.70), and behavioral CQ (aAmerican = 0.87, aEast Asian =
0.77). All items were measured on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

estimates for both the unitizing process (i.e., unitizing reliability)
as well as the coding process (i.e., interpretive reliability)
were calculated. Third, sequences of negotiation tactics of theoretical interest were counted automatically through a computer
program.

Cognitive ability
Cognitive ability was measured using the Wonderlic Personnel
Test (WPT; Wonderlic & Associates, 2000), a 12-min speed test
consisting of 50 questions that assesses an individual’s math and
verbal abilities. Preliminary analyses at the individual level indicated that East Asians scored signiﬁcantly lower than Americans
(MEast Asian = 24.66, SD = 4.57; MAmerican = 31.49, SD = 4.75;
t(128) = 8.35, p < .01), most likely because the Wonderlic requires
knowledge of difﬁcult English proverbs. Accordingly, raw scores
were standardized into Z scores within each cultural group for
analyses.

Unitizing of transcripts
The unitizing step involved parsing the negotiation dialogue in
each transcript into ‘‘thought units”, where a thought unit consists
of one idea or thought, which roughly corresponds to a sentence.
Three research assistants were each given a manual of unitizing
rules, and were trained on how to unitize the transcripts through
multiple practice sessions. In each practice session, the ﬁrst author
and the three research assistants unitized a practice transcript
individually, and then went over the unitizing together, discussing
in detail any challenging cases. For example, research assistants
were reminded that in some cases, multiple thought units need
to be parsed within one sentence (e.g., ‘‘/ I want 60% of the ﬂoor
space” / ‘‘because my products take up more space than yours do
/”). Furthermore, they were also reminded that immediately repeated thoughts or ideas that were identical should be counted
as one thought unit (e.g., ‘‘/ I’d like to close later. I prefer later /
”). The research assistants continued practice sessions until they
reached a high level of agreement, or unitizing reliability, based
on three randomly drawn full transcripts. For each of the three
transcripts, unitizing reliability was calculated with Guetzkow’s
U (Guetzkow, 1950) for all pairs of research assistants. Guetzkow’s
U refers to ‘‘the difference between the number of units identiﬁed
by an independent coder and the ‘‘true” number of units (the average of two coders’ estimates; Weingart et al., 2004, p. 448).” For
any one transcript, the average Guetzkow’s U across all pairs of research assistants was under 0.06, indicating high unitizing reliability. The three research assistants then unitized their own set of
transcripts.

Emotional intelligence
Emotional intelligence was measured using Schutte et al.’s
(1998) 33-item scale that has been validated and was developed
based on Salovey and Mayer’s (1990) conceptualization of the construct (aAmerican = 0.87; aEast Asian = 0.91). An example item is
‘‘When I experience a positive emotion, I know how to make it
last”, and was administered on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree).
Openness to experience and extraversion
Openness to experience and extraversion were measured with
10 items each from Goldberg et al.’s (2006) short version of the
International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item
for openness is, ‘‘I have excellent ideas” (aAmerican = 0.78, aEast
Asian = 0.82), and for extraversion, ‘‘I am the life of the party” (aAmerican = 0.90, aEast Asian = 0.89). Both were answered on a 1 (very inaccurate) to 5 (very accurate) scale.
International experience
International experience was measured as the total length of
time participants have spent living abroad, which has been validated by Takeuchi, Tesluk, Yun, and Lepak (2005). Participants
were asked to list in chronological order from most recent to
least recent, the countries and duration of experiences of living
abroad. All living experiences were summed and converted to
weeks.
Demographics
Five demographic variables were measured: sex (1 = female,
2 = male), level of education (1 = undergraduate, 2 = graduate),
age (years), negotiation experience (1 = no, 2 = yes), and the East
Asian’s length of stay in the US (months).
Joint proﬁt
Joint proﬁt was measured as the sum of the points earned by
both negotiators across all ﬁve issues.
Coding of negotiation tactics and sequences
After all the process data had been transcribed for each dyad,
three overall steps were taken to ensure consistency in coding of
negotiation tactics (elaborated below). First, the transcripts were
unitized by three research assistants, that is, parsed into units
that would eventually be coded for negotiation tactics. Second,
the unitized transcripts were content-coded for negotiation tactics by two coders. Because reproducibility of coding requires
reliability in both steps (Folger, Hewes, & Poole, 1984), reliability

Content-coding of negotiation tactics
Once the unitizing was complete for all transcripts, two coders, blind to the research hypotheses, were given coding manuals
adapted from one used by Weingart et al. (2004) for their Towers Market II negotiation simulation, and were trained to content
code the unitized transcripts (see Appendix B for deﬁnition,
examples, and strategic grouping of codes of negotiation tactics).
As shown in Appendix B, we coded for a number of negotiation
tactics that conceptually fall under two broad types of strategies:
integrative information and cooperative relationship management. Consistent with previous cross-cultural research (Adair,
2003; Adair & Brett, 2005; Adair et al., 2001), we coded for direct
and indirect ways of conveying/eliciting integrative information.
More speciﬁcally, we coded for direct integrative information
behaviors such as making issue priority statements across two
or more issues (IR) and questioning other’s priorities across
two or more issues (QR). We also coded for more indirect ways
of conveying integrative information; that is, making multi-issue
offers (OM). Cooperative relationship management involved making miscellaneous relationship-focused cooperative comments
(R-C).
Again, coders were given a coding manual and trained
through multiple practice sessions. In each practice session, the
ﬁrst author and the two coders coded a practice transcript individually, and then went over them together, discussing in detail
what differentiates each code from other codes. If any disagreement emerged or if coders pointed out any particularly challenging cases, the ﬁrst author further explained the nuanced
differences among the codes. For example, coders were reminded
to only code a given tactic as an issue priority statement if the
negotiator reveals priority differences across negotiation issues

and not within negotiation issues. Also, coders were reminded
that multi-issue offers must be offers that specify alternatives
within two or more negotiation issues, and mere general suggestions to combine two or more negotiation issues should not be
counted as multi-issue offers. With such reminders from the ﬁrst
author throughout the practice sessions, the two coders gradually
developed strong agreement regarding the application of codes.
Coders were trained until they reached high inter-rater reliability, based on three randomly drawn full transcripts. The average
inter-rater reliability between the two coders across the three
transcripts was high (Cohen’s K = 0.88). Once the coders reached
this high inter-rater reliability, they content-coded their own set
of transcripts.

negotiators’ relationship was followed by another such cooperative
comment.
To control for the total number of speaking turns across
dyads (i.e., the length of the negotiation), the raw frequencies
for each type of strategic sequence were converted into relative
frequencies (Adair, 2003). More speciﬁcally, each raw frequency
was divided by the dyad’s total number of speaking turns – 1.
Because the dependent variable was a proportion bounded by
0 and 1, it was then logit-transformed to stretch the tails of
the distribution as recommended by Cohen, Cohen, West, and
Aiken (2003).

Study 2 results
Calculating sequences of negotiation tactics
Descriptive statistics
Once all transcripts were content-coded for negotiation tactics,
the entire sequence of codes for each dyad transcript was entered
into a computer software program (GSQ; General Sequential Querier, Bakeman & Quera, 1995; see also Bakeman & Gottman, 1986)
so that sequences of integrative information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors could
be counted automatically for each dyad.
Calculating sequences at the immediate time lag
In counting the frequency of sequences of integrative information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors, sequences were counted at the immediate time
lag (c.f. Adair, 2003). Immediate time lags occur when the behavior
elicited by negotiator 1 is immediately followed in the next speaking turn by the behavior elicited by negotiator 2. Appendix C illustrates a sample coded transcript where there are a total of six
speaking turns between negotiator 1 and negotiator 2. Because
there are six total speaking turns, there are ﬁve possible lag sequences (Nspeaking turn 1) in which sequences of theoretical interest can occur (i.e., speaking turn 1 (multi-issue offer) ? speaking
turn 2 (issue priority statement); speaking turn 2 (issue priority
statement) ? speaking turn 3 (issue priority statement); speaking
turn 3 (issue priority statement) ? speaking turn 4 (issue priority
statement); speaking turn 4 (issue priority statement) ? speaking
turn 5 (issue priority statement); speaking turn 5 (issue priority
statement) ? speaking turn 6 (multi-issue offer)—in this example,
all ﬁve lag sequences are sequences of integrative information
behaviors).
Sequences of integrative information behaviors: Reciprocal and
complementary
Sequences of integrative information behaviors were examined
in two ways: (1) reciprocal sequences and (2) complementary sequences (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). A reciprocal sequence of integrative information behaviors occurs when the two negotiation
tactics comprising the sequence are identical (e.g. Appendix C,
speaking turn 2 (issue priority statement) ? speaking turn 3 (issue
priority statement)). For each dyad, reciprocal sequences for each
negotiation tactic within the integrative information strategy were
counted and summed to give an overall count of reciprocal sequences across all tactic types. A complementary sequence of integrative information behaviors occurs when the two negotiation
tactics comprising the sequence are not identical in terms of tactical codes, but are of the same integrative information strategy (e.g.
Appendix C, speaking turn 5 (issue priority statement) ? speaking
turn 6 (multi-issue offer)).
Sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors
Sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors occurred when a cooperative, non task-focused comment on the

Individual-level inter-correlations among all demographic variables and individual difference measures are found in Table 2. Table 3 presents the means and standard deviations of these
measures by each cultural group, as well as comparisons of means
between the two cultural groups. East Asians and Americans did
not signiﬁcantly differ on mean levels of CQ, although East Asians
had greater international experience (MEast Asian = 138.27, SDEast
Asian = 95.87; MAmerican = 28.06, SDAmerican = 96.93; t(122) = 6.37,
p < .01, lower openness (MEast Asian = 3.40, SDEast Asian = 0.60; MAmer8.13, p < .01), and lower
ican = 4.18, SDAmerican = 0.46; t(122) =
extraversion (MEast Asian = 3.09, SDEast Asian = 0.73; MAmerican = 3.37,
SDAmerican = 0.79; t(122) = 2.04, p < .05) than Americans.
Prior to testing our hypotheses, all individual difference scores
were aggregated to the dyad-level by averaging the two negotiators’ scores. Dyad means and standard deviations, and dyad-level
inter-correlations among individual difference measures, sequences, outcomes, as well as demographic variables are shown
in Table 4. Three dyads did not reach agreement; therefore, these
cases were excluded from analyses with a ﬁnal dyad sample size
of 62.2
Tests of hypotheses
Overall CQ and negotiation process
Hypothesis 3 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ would
engage in more sequences of integrative information behaviors (reciprocal and complementary) than dyads with lower overall CQ,
over and beyond international experience, openness, extraversion,
cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence. Analyses were conducted separately for complementary and reciprocal sequences
using hierarchical regression. For both analyses, to provide a conservative test, international experience, openness, extraversion,
cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence were entered in the
ﬁrst step, while overall CQ was entered in the second step. Because
reciprocal sequences were signiﬁcantly correlated with the demographic variable of mean age (r(60) = .38, p < .01), mean age was
also included as a control variable in the ﬁrst step in analyzing reciprocal sequences.
In terms of complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, Table 5 shows that none of the other individual differences entered in step 1 (i.e., international experience, openness,
extraversion, cognitive ability, emotional intelligence) signiﬁcantly
improved sequences of integrative information behaviors. As
2
Including the three impasse dyads did not change results pertaining to the effects
of CQ on sequences of integrative information behaviors, nor the effects of CQ on
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors. This was true whether
CQ was analyzed at the overall or facet level, and whether it was analyzed as the dyad
mean or dyad minimum.

hypothesized however, overall CQ at the dyad-level entered in step
2 signiﬁcantly predicted complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors (b = 0.31, p < .05; DR2 = .07, p < .05). Dyads
with higher CQ engaged in more sequences consisting of various
types of integrative information behaviors. In terms of reciprocal
sequences of integrative information behaviors, Table 5 also shows
that none of the other individual differences entered in step 1 (i.e.,
international experience, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability,
emotional intelligence) nor overall CQ entered in step 2 signiﬁcantly increased reciprocal sequences of integrative information
behaviors (b = 0.13, p > .30; DR2 = .01, p = .37). Thus, CQ appears
to have its effects on complementary sequences.
In order to explore which of the four CQ facets was driving the
overall CQ effect on complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, we conducted additional regression analyses
entering the other individual differences into the regression equation in step 1 and all four facets of CQ in step 2. Table 6 shows that
motivational CQ largely drove the effect overall CQ had on complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors (b = 0.45,
p < .01; DR2 = .19, p < .05).
Hypothesis 4 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ would
engage in more sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond

international experience, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability,
and emotional intelligence. Table 7 shows that none of the other
individual differences entered in step 1 (i.e., international experience, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability, emotional intelligence), nor dyad overall CQ entered in step 2 signiﬁcantly
increased sequences of cooperative relationship management
behaviors (b = 0.15, p > .30; DR2 = .02, p = .31). Analyses at the facet
level, however, revealed that when all four facets of CQ were entered into the regression equation in step 2 after controlling for
the other individual differences in step 1, behavioral CQ increased
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors
(b = 0.41, p < .05; DR2 = .12, p = .11; Table 7). Dyads with higher
behavioral CQ, or verbal and non-verbal behavioral ﬂexibility, were
able to reciprocate non-task-related cooperative comments.3

We also explored whether dyad-level CQ has any inﬂuence on the sequencing of
distributive negotiation behaviors (i.e., making single issue offers, stating one’s
preferences within a single issue, asking questions about the other’s preferences
within a single issue, offering substantiations, and asking questions regarding other’s
substantiations). Using multiple regression and controlling for openness, international experience, extraversion, emotional intelligence and cognitive ability, we found
no signiﬁcant effects of dyad CQ (overall or facet-level) on sequences of distributive
negotiation behaviors.

Negotiation process and negotiation outcomes
Hypotheses 5 and 6 predicted that sequences of integrative
information behaviors (reciprocal and complementary) and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors would
predict joint proﬁt, respectivey. Reciprocal, complementary, and
cooperative sequences were included simultaneously in the regression equation to see if each had a unique effect on joint proﬁt. Results showed that there were signiﬁcant relationships between
reciprocal sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.35, p < .01), complementary sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.39, p < .01), and cooperative relationship management sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.29,
p < .01), supporting both hypotheses. Thus, dyads that engaged in
more sequences consisting of identical integrative behaviors, more
sequences of non-identical integrative behaviors, as well as more
sequences of cooperative non-task-related comments were much
better able to create value at the negotiation table in an intercultural context.4

Dyad composition
Hypothesis 7 predicted that the level of sequencing of integrative information behaviors and sequencing of cooperative relationship management behaviors would be no greater than what is
determined by the minimum level of CQ in the dyad. We addressed
this issue by substituting the dyad mean CQ score by either the
dyad minimum CQ score (i.e. the lower CQ negotiator’s score) or
the dyad maximum CQ score (i.e. the higher CQ negotiator’s score)
to see which had more of an effect on negotiation sequences (c.f.
Barry & Friedman, 1998). The results illustrated that it is the minimum CQ that elicit a pattern of signiﬁcant results very similar to
those obtained from using the dyad mean CQ scores. More specifically, minimum overall CQ and minimum motivational CQ had a
signiﬁcant effect on complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors (bMin Overall CQ = 0.30, p = .05; bMin Motivational
CQ = 0.47, p < .01). By contrast, maximum overall CQ and maximum
motivational CQ did not have any inﬂuence on complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors (bMax Overall CQ = 0.13,
p > .30; bMax Motivational CQ = 0.27, p = .09). For sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors, minimum behavioral
CQ had a signiﬁcant effect (b = 0.47, p < .01), whereas maximum
behavioral CQ did not (b = 0.25, p > .10). In all, this pattern of results suggests that it is the negotiators with the lower CQ that
inﬂuence the extent to which dyads engage in advantageous
sequences.
Discussion
Despite the obvious importance of being able to negotiate
effectively across cultures in today’s world of increasing global
interdependence, little understanding exists on what predicts
intercultural negotiation effectiveness. We set out in this paper
to investigate whether cultural intelligence (CQ) among other
individual difference characteristics predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness. In study 1, we argued that CQ equips individuals with psychological characteristics advantageous for
intercultural negotiation, and indeed, we found that individuals
with higher CQ tend to have higher cooperative motives and epistemic motivation than individuals with lower CQ. In study 2,
we argued that such psychological characteristics enable higher
CQ negotiators to overcome hurdles endemic to intercultural
negotiation contexts by adopting more integrative negotiation
strategies and investing more cognitive effort into accurately
4
We also conducted additional analyses where we examined whether individuallevel CQ had an effect on individual proﬁt (using HLM), controlling for openness,
international experience, extraversion, emotional intelligence and cognitive ability.
There were no signiﬁcant effects of CQ (overall or facet-level) on individual proﬁt.

understanding their culturally unfamiliar counterparts. Thus, we
expected dyads consisting of higher CQ to maintain more stable
sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors, ultimately achieving more optimal outcomes than dyads consisting of lower CQ.
Consistent with this prediction, we found that overall dyad CQ,
measured a week prior to negotiations predicts the extent to
which negotiators engage in complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, which in turn predicts joint proﬁt.
Notably, this effect was present even when controlling for cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, openness, extraversion, and
international experience. Moreover, none of these other individual difference characteristics increased sequences of integrative
information behaviors.
Theoretical contributions
This research makes a number of contributions to different
bodies of literature. First, our research expands the culture and

negotiation literature by moving beyond cross-cultural comparisons of negotiation, and being one of the ﬁrst to directly ask what
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. As such, we identiﬁed CQ as one capability that improves intercultural negotiation
processes, and thereby outcomes. Second, we also contribute to
the individual differences and negotiation literature by showing
that some individual difference characteristics, argued or found
to be advantageous for integrative negotiation in intracultural contexts, may not be so in intercultural contexts. For example, our
analysis revealed that none of the other individual difference characteristics examined, including cognitive ability (Barry & Friedman,
1998; Kurtzberg, 1998), emotional intelligence (Elfenbein, Foo,
et al., 2007; Elfenbein, Foo, et al., 2007), openness (Ma & Jaeger,
2005), nor extraversion (Barry & Friedman, 1998) signiﬁcantly improved integrative negotiation processes. Therefore, researchers
should not assume that individual difference characteristics have
all-encompassing inﬂuences on negotiation processes across all
situations, but instead consider the ﬁt between the particular individual difference characteristic and the speciﬁc negotiation context
(e.g., intracultural vs. intercultural) in inﬂuencing negotiation
processes.5
This research also expands the nascent CQ literature in a number of ways. By studying in depth the relationship between CQ and
micro-level behavioral processes in a negotiation context, we show
that CQ can improve objective performance in addition to the self-

5
Notably, however, close examination of our correlation analysis in Table 1 shows
that dyad cognitive ability was not related to sequencing of integrative negotiations
behavior, yet did have a positive correlation with joint proﬁt (replicating past
research; e.g., Barry & Friedman, 1998). Thus, it could be that negotiators with high
cognitive ability, unlike negotiators with high cultural intelligence, arrive at mutually
beneﬁcial outcomes via alternative routes other than the motivated cooperative
sequencing of integrative information behaviors. For example, it could be speculated
that negotiators with high cognitive ability can better analyze the complexity of the
negotiation task and glean information from processes such as trial and error.

reported affective outcomes (e.g., cross-cultural adjustment) that
has been the larger focus in this literature. Furthermore, by showing the positive relationship between CQ and cooperative motives,
as well as CQ and epistemic motivation in study 1, we expand the
nomological network of the CQ construct. By doing so, we also expand upon the group decision-making literature, or more speciﬁcally on De Dreu et al. (2008)’s Motivated Information Processing
in Groups (MIP-G) model. The MIP-G model states that in mixed
motive group tasks like negotiation, cooperative motives and epistemic motivation both inﬂuence the quality of problem solving,
dissemination of information, and the negotiation of joint decisions. Recently, the authors have argued that while cooperative
motives and epistemic motivation are orthogonal constructs, certain states and/or traits should stimulate both cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation among individuals. As such, we provide
ﬁrst time support for the notion that certain psychological states,
in this case CQ, can stimulate both constructs.
While our main ﬁnding was that overall CQ predicts sequences
of integrative information behaviors, analyses at the facet level revealed that motivational CQ strongly drove this effect. This ﬁnding
is perhaps not surprising, considering our theory is that CQ provides
negotiators with cooperative motives and epistemic motivation,
and motivational CQ seems to have the most obvious conceptual
ties to both these constructs compared to the other facets. For
example, individuals with higher motivational CQ enjoy interacting
with people from different cultures; thus, are less likely to make ingroup–outgroup distinctions and are more likely to have cooperative motives than individuals with lower CQ. Furthermore,
individuals with higher motivational CQ enjoy unfamiliar cultures
and are self-efﬁcacious in adapting to situations of cultural diversity; therefore, when faced with intercultural communication
ambiguities, they should persist and invest great effort into forming
an accurate understanding of their culturally unfamiliar counterparts and surroundings—in other words, have high epistemic motivation. Thus, motivational CQ seems to be most strongly related to
both cooperative motives and epistemic motivation at the same
time, relative to meta-cognitive CQ (i.e., mindfulness and adjustment of one’s own cultural knowledge), cognitive CQ (i.e., cross-cultural knowledge), and behavioral CQ (i.e., behavioral ﬂexibility).
Furthermore, the fact that high motivational CQ predicts sequences
of integrative information behaviors parallels US intracultural
negotiation research, which has found that highly efﬁcacious negotiators engage in more open information exchange (O’Connor & Arnold, 2001). We expand this literature by showing that self-efﬁcacy
speciﬁcally for cross-cultural encounters is key to developing and
maintaining sequences of information exchange behaviors.
This research also illustrates that different facets of CQ relate to
different behavioral processes. For example, we found that behavioral CQ predicts sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors. In the broader social psychological literature, the
sequencing or reciprocation of cooperative behaviors in itself is a
widespread phenomenon (Braver, 1975; Cialdini, Green, & Rusch,
1992; Rosenbaum, 1980) based on the norm of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960). In our research, we found that the reciprocation of non
task-related cooperative comments in particular, occurs more frequently among negotiators with higher behavioral CQ—the ability
to respond appropriately both verbally and non-verbally to culturally different others. Notably, however, motivational CQ did not relate to this type of reciprocation. It could be speculated that the
reciprocation of non task-related comments such as pleasantries
and expressing enthusiasm for working together, as an interpersonal skill, is more strongly inﬂuenced by negotiators’ ability to adjust their tone, accent, and facial expressions (i.e., behavioral CQ)
while having intrinsic motivation and efﬁcacy in adjusting to
new cultures (i.e., motivational CQ) has greater relevance for the
ability to identify mutually beneﬁcial agreements.

Finally, in terms of dyad composition, we found that the negotiator with the lower level of CQ rather than the negotiator with
the higher level of CQ had more of an impact on the extent to
which the dyad engaged in effective sequences. If one considers
the conjunctive nature (Steiner, 1972) of the task of sequencing,
this dyad composition effect makes sense. Sequencing integrative
behaviors is a joint task that requires the contributions of both
negotiators; thus, the dyad-level performance can only be as good
as its ‘‘weakest link.” Even if one negotiator within the dyad has
high CQ and tries to adopt an integrative strategy with the goal
of becoming synchronized with the other, if the other lower CQ
negotiator does not reciprocate the integrative behaviors, overall,
the dyad still suffers as a result. For example, the higher CQ negotiator’s requests at exchanging integrative information may be ignored by the lower CQ negotiator. Alternatively, the higher CQ
negotiator may have to ask multiple times for integrative information, or even explain the advantage of using integrative strategies
before the lower CQ negotiator reciprocates. In either case, it would
be the lower CQ negotiator rather than the higher CQ negotiator
who would prevent the continuous, immediate exchange of integrative behaviors necessary to achieve high joint gains.
Practical implications
Global interdependence requires that people negotiate on a daily
basis across cultural boundaries. We now have initial evidence that
this process is facilitated particularly by cultural intelligence. As
such, managers, diplomats, military personnel, among many others,
who are in such situations should be selected for their level of cultural intelligence. While it is widespread practice for American
ﬁrms to select individuals for overseas assignments primarily based
on technical experience and competence (Black et al., 1991; Moran
et al., 1987), managers should also consider in conjunction with
these factors, their employees’ CQ in negotiation contexts. Of
course, organizations cannot control the CQ level of their employees’ negotiation counterparts; yet they can be sure that their own
employees who are negotiating interculturally do not have low levels of CQ which will hamper agreements as this research has shown.
Furthermore, in addition to selection, managers should also develop
training programs for negotiators to increase their CQ. For example,
given the central role of the motivational facet of CQ in predicting
intercultural negotiation effectiveness, employees might be trained
to increase their self-efﬁcacy, particularly in terms of adapting to
new cultures. Indeed, the goal-setting literature in the US has shown
that setting challenging and speciﬁc goals increases the resiliency of
individuals’ self-efﬁcacy beliefs (e.g., Gist, 1987). Accordingly, managers might implement programs to increase motivational CQ
through training that focuses on setting challenging and speciﬁc
goals pertaining to cross-cultural adaptation.
Limitations and future research
All research methods have limitations (McGrath, Martin, &
Kulka, 1982), and this study is no exception. Given that this research was conducted in the laboratory which maximizes internal
control, future research should examine the impact of CQ on negotiations within real world settings. In addition, we used a self-report measure of CQ, where although it has been validated,
nevertheless has limitations associated with self-reports. Future research should use more objective methods (e.g., peer assessments,
direct observations) to provide converging evidence for our ﬁndings. Our research suggests that relying on more objective assessments is particularly important for the cognitive facets of CQ.
Surprisingly, neither meta-cognitive CQ nor cognitive CQ was correlated with need for cognition, and this may suggest that measuring
the cognitive dimensions of CQ with self-report is particularly not

optimal. In addition to the self-report measure of CQ, we also used a
self-report measure of emotional intelligence. However, although
existing performance-based tests of emotional intelligence (e.g.,
MSCEIT; Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, & Sitarenios, 2003) would alleviate
disadvantages associated with self-report methods, the validity of
such tests for different cultural samples is unclear. For example,
some questions present participants with a hypothetical social situation and ask them to identify emotions that would be helpful to
have in those contexts (e.g., ‘‘What mood might be helpful to feel
when meeting in-laws for the very ﬁrst time?”). Given the different
meanings and norms associated with such situations, it is unlikely
that there is one ‘‘objective” emotionally intelligent answer that
generalizes across cultural contexts. The self-report measure of
emotional intelligence on the other hand asks participants to rate
their emotional intelligence in general, without asking them to
think about culture-speciﬁc situations. Finally, the vast majority
of intercultural negotiation studies have focused on interactions between Americans and East Asians, and this study is no exception.
Future research should move beyond examining Paciﬁc Rim cultures to see if the positive effects of CQ on intercultural negotiation
effectiveness generalize to negotiations between other cultures
(e.g., the Middle East) as well.
There are a number of research questions that arise from our
investigation that currently await future research. For example,
while our study focused on the role of CQ in an intercultural context,
it remains to be seen whether CQ can also beneﬁt intracultural negotiation. On one hand, given that CQ provides negotiators with cooperative motives, it is reasonable to suspect that it can also be
advantageous in intracultural contexts. On the other hand, high CQ
negotiators might not have their prosocial and epistemic motivation
activated as much in intracultural situations. Future studies examining the effects of CQ on negotiation among mono-cultural dyads of
East Asians as well as Americans would help delineate this issue.
Furthermore, future research should examine in further detail
whether high CQ negotiators rely on sequencing culturally normative behaviors, culturally non-normative behaviors, or both, on their
path to optimal negotiation outcomes.6 Future research should also
apply the ﬁne-grained analysis of the sequencing of verbal negotiation
behaviors as studied in this research to the sequencing of non-verbal
behaviors which has not received much attention in the intercultural
negotiation literature. In addition, it would be worthwhile to explore

whether there is a ‘‘dark side” to CQ. Our research on integrative negotiation focused on a relatively cooperative context where negotiators
cultivated relationships; however, there are competitive contexts
such as disputing where negotiators focus on dissolving relationships
amidst strong negative emotions. Possibly, these competitive negotiation contexts may moderate the prosocial inﬂuences of CQ found in
our research, such that high CQ negotiators take advantage of their
extensive cultural knowledge and behavioral ﬂexibility in order to deceive their lower CQ counterparts. In other words, in accordance with
what the military strategist Sun Tzu would prescribe, high CQ negotiators may be better able to keep their friends close but to keep their
enemies closer (Sun Tzu & Giles, 2005) in hyper-competitive intercultural contexts. Finally, given that the dyadic composition of CQ is an
important predictor of effective negotiation sequences, future research should continue to explore issues of ‘ﬁt.’ For example, it would
be interesting to use polynomial regressions to examine how negotiators’ CQ levels ﬁt to inﬂuence negotiation processes and outcomes.
Conclusion
This research moved beyond cross-cultural comparisons of
negotiation behaviors to directly examine negotiation behaviors
as they occur in intercultural contexts. This study illustrates that
CQ is a key predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness.
Practically speaking, employees should be selected on CQ to maximize the chances of optimal agreements in intercultural negotiations. In a world where there is increasing opportunities for
cooperation as well as threats of conﬂict at the global level for
managers and political leaders alike, CQ holds the promise for
helping us manage our global interdependence.
