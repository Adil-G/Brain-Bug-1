Abstract The primary concern of quality improvement in professional services is not the
input-output conversion, but the information that enables and controls action. The quality of
information, however, remains a vaguely defined concept. Actionable information is here defined
as meaning derived from data and context with a knowledge function. Standard definitions of
quality are elaborated to make them applicable to information: closed system technical quality and
open system negotiated quality are postulated as ideal types. This construct is used to define
information quality and suggest guidelines for methodology development.

Introduction
Quality management is one of the major organizational innovations of the
twentieth century. It has contributed a scientifically grounded methodology to
deal with defects in production, focused attention on customers, and
emphasized participative management practices in industry. There have
been attempts to replicate its success in public services, governance relations,
and information systems (Juran and Godfrey, 1999). However, quality
management has its roots in mass manufacturing for a market economy. It
emerged from a world where standardized processes are managed by “facts”
aiming at uncontroversial production targets approved by rational actors
making informed choices in free markets. It is thus based on a world-view of
positivistic epistemology and functionalistic systems (Jackson, 2000; Silvestro,
1998). Applications in areas where such assumptions are not valid tend to be
problematic (see Morgan and Murgatroyd, 1994; Kirkpatrick and Lucio, 1995;
Adams, 1998). Such areas are primarily professional services, such as
healthcare and software engineering. They have typically non-routine
processes, unpredictable environments, controversial objectives and may
involve non-market transactions. A primary problem in such areas appears not
to be the quality of the actual conversion of input to output, such as performing
surgery or writing code, but the control information guiding it. In other words,
the primary problem is not doing things right, but having the information
telling what are the right things to do here and now. Several studies indicate
that poor, incomplete, late or missing information is perceived as a most serious
quality problem (English, 1999; Ferguson and Lim, 2001; Crump, 2002). Huang
et al. (1999) emphasize that information should not be treated as a mere

by-product of various activities but with the same seriousness as products.
Quality of information, however, seems to be an elusive concept.
Attempts to define the quality of information follow patterns established in
the quality literature. An obvious approach is to focus on customer
requirements. High quality information satisfies application criteria specified
by the user (Salaun and Flores, 2001; English, 1999; Strong, 1997). This
approach, however, can be used only in situations, such as regular and strictly
formatted accounting and inventory management systems, where users know
what they are supposed to know and are able to define their information
requirements ex ante. In many instances this is not the case. Customer
requirements-based definitions fail to deal with the “information paradox” – an
evaluation of information presupposes that the information to be produced or
delivered is already known (Wigand et al., 1997, p. 91). Customer
requirements-based approaches are not applicable in situations where
customers, for various reasons, do not know or are not able to articulate
their needs.
Another familiar approach is to produce lists of conceivable information
quality dimensions or attributes (Salmela, 1997; Tozer, 1999), following the
well-known framework developed by Garvin (1988). Huang et al. (1999) have
produced the most extensive list defining 15 dimensions grouped into four
classes:
(1) intrinsic quality: accuracy, objectivity, believability, and reputation;
(2) accessibility quality: access, and security;
(3) contextual quality: relevancy, value-added, timeliness, completeness and
amount of data; and
(4) representational quality: interpretability, ease of understanding, concise
representation, and consistent representation.
The attribute-list approach is in many ways problematic. If product quality can
be fully described as the sum of several attributes, why use the general term
“quality” at all? Attribute lists make no distinction between information itself
and context-dependent elements, such as timing and reputation. Further, the
question about information as an output and as a process remains vague. The
quality of information is often confused with the quality of information
systems (von Hellens, 1997; Andersson and von Hellens, 1997). This leads to a
confusion of objectives and processes: the “what” and the “how” are not
separated.
The purpose of this paper is, first, to delineate and define the types and
aspects of information that could be subject to quality assessment. Focus is on
control information, that is, information used in business processes to initiate,
guide, control, monitor and improve activities. Second, the established quality
definitions are elaborated in order to highlight aspects that could be applied to
information. Third, a construct for defining the quality of information is

<-----Page 2----->presented. Finally, some principles for developing a methodology for assessing
and measuring the quality of information are discussed.

Defining information
Defining quality requires an understanding of the entity that is assumed to
have a property called quality. In the case of manufactured products and
commercial services intended for purchase in a market, this usually poses no
major problem. However, in the case of immaterial outputs for non-market
situations, such as public service and administration, unclear role relations
between customers, citizens, civil servants and legislators complicate the
situation. Before defining its quality, information needs to be defined.
There are various approaches to information. While some writers make no
distinction between data and information (Wang et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1999;
English, 1999), some others see the difference as most crucial (Tozer, 1999). The
knowledge management school (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Davenport and
Prusak, 1998) draws a line between information and knowledge.
One widely adopted approach, also followed here, is empirical and inductive.
Data, information and knowledge are seen as a hierarchical structure
(Checkland and Hollowell, 1998; Tozer, 1999; Boisot, 1998; Devlin, 1999). The
starting point is to assume that the observable world consists of things and
events that have properties that have states. Data are thus a codified and
communicable symbolic representation of entities, properties and their states.
They have content (representation) and form (record) that allow storage,
retrieval, transfer, aggregation, and analysis. Data can turn into information if
they are put into a context and given meaning, such as when a data set
describing economic transactions is aggregated and put into an economic
context as Gross National Product. Following this approach information
necessarily includes data, meaning, and context.
Another approach would be rationalistic and deductive. Information is
logically derived from theories or principles, for example chemical substances,
animals and plants are classified and labeled following established rules.
If information reveals something about how the world is, knowledge tells
something about how the world works (Nonaka and Teece, 2001, p. 2).
According to Boisot (1998, p. 12) data are a property of things, while knowledge
is a property of agents predisposing them to act. Information establishes a
relation between things and agents. The elementary form of actionable,
predictive knowledge is made of theories of the type “if A then B with
probability p” (Shewhart, 1931; Argyris and Schön, 1978). Thus we can say that
A and B consist of information about states or events, while their relation and
its probability distribution is knowledge. There are, obviously, other types,
such as knowledge derived from pure reason, intuition, or tradition that,
however, need not to be of concern here.

Data represent the content of information; its meaning is a function of the
data and the context (McMaster and Grinder, 1993; Sen, 2001). For example,
assume we have a number. Devoid of context, it carries no meaning. Assume
we are told it is the net profit of company XYZ. We know it is calculated
following accepted accounting procedures thus being, for practical purposes,
true and standardized representation. With this contextual information, the
number is assigned an elementary meaning. It assumes richer meaning as we
add more contextual information from ordinary accounting statements, such as
how much it is as percentage of sales, investment and equity, what was the
same number for the previous period, and were there any extraordinary
charges. Leaving the semi-closed context of accounting reports, the scope may
be expanded to intra-industry comparisons and further to informal gossip
about owners, managers and their intentions. While the piece of data, the
number, stays the same; its meaning is dependent on other pieces of
information, time, and knowledge about accounting and businesses’
particularities that define its context. Meaning is important, since the value
of information depends on it; only meaningful information can enable
purposeful action. Thus the question about the quality of information should
focus on its ability to elicit meaning.
This leads to the following conceptualization. Data are the factual content of
information. Meaning is a function of data and their context. This can be
formalized as M ¼ f ðD; CÞ. If an actor has a piece of reliable data (D), is
informed about the context (C), and possesses relevant knowledge about how
the world works in this respect ( f), she can assign a meaning (M) to the piece of
data turning it to information. Other agents may join contributing different
knowledge functions and contextual information to the negotiation of meaning.
The unit of analysis is thereby not a piece of information but a communicative
act (Habermas, 1998) or sensemaking process (Weick, 1995). Apparently all the
elements and capabilities involved are variable properties, which leads to the
conclusion that information can be defined as bi-polar ideal types. If data and
context are exactly defined, and if the knowledge function producing meaning
is predetermined, information moves in a formal, closed system. If data, context
and the knowledge function are fuzzy and interpretation or negotiation is
required to assign meaning, information moves in an informal open system.
Defining quality
Traditional definitions
Reeves and Bednar (1994) classify quality definitions found in the literature
into four categories: excellence, value for money, conformity to requirements,
and meeting or exceeding customer requirements. All of these are subject to
debate.
Excellence-based definitions include the idea that products or services may
include elements that are perceived as superior or even transcendental. This

<-----Page 4----->approach is very subjective, hard to measure, and tends to confuse quality with
product segments and grades. It may be useful in developing visions, but does
not allow systematic management. Value-based definitions tend to be
tautological. For example, Hansen (2001, p. 205) defines quality as value and
then writes that value is the relation between price and quality; that is q ¼ q=p.
From this follows q ¼ p: quality equals price. Following Zeithaml (1988),
perceived value is defined as the consumer’s overall assessment of the utility of
a product or a service based on perceptions of what is received and what is
given. Value is assigned when products and services are involved in
transactions where they are compared to, evaluated against, and exchanged for
money or money equivalents. Value is thus not a property of a product or a
service, but of a transaction involving give and get. Consequently quality does
not equal value; rather quality is an element that affects perceived utility in a
transaction context.
The most widely used definitions, such as the American Society for
Quality (ASQ) and the more recent ISO 9000-2000 definitions, are based on
customer satisfaction, which may be achieved not only through
conformance to requirements but also some inherent characteristics of the
product or service, and the ways they are presented and delivered to
customers.
Before applying quality to control information, however, some elaboration of
the quality definitions is required. First, what kinds of entities can be described
in quality terms? While mechanical products and standardized services are
obvious cases, is it appropriate to describe human relations, working life, pieces
of art, or governance structures in quality terms? Second, while it is generally
recognized that quality is not a thing but a relation, what is the exact nature of
the relation? What is compared to what on which grounds? Third, assuming
that quality is a relation, an agency perspective would be necessary: which are
the relevant actors entitled to pass judgment about quality? Assuming it is
always the customer is a simplification. The concept of a customer is not
homogenous, but includes three roles: the chooser, the payer, and the user,
which may have different, even contradictory requirements. There are
instances where quality must be defined by regulators or third-party assessors
in conflict with customers. Fourth, the relationship between quality and time
remains unclear: can an actor know quality before, during or after its
production or emergence, or, as Zeithaml (1988) puts it, at preparation, point of
purchase, or consumption? Fifth, quality has both an upside leading to
satisfaction, and a downside leading to dissatisfaction. Poor quality is seen as a
consequence of excessive variation, ignored requirements or broken promises.
The assumption is that quality is known before production starts. However, if
quality is not known sufficiently ex ante, the downside may be a bit different,
including inadequate selections from various alternatives or best-intention
decisions that after the fact turn out to carry significant losses.

The following conceptualization attempts to answer these concerns by
applying a system perspective and postulating two polar ideal types: closed
system technical quality of artifacts vs open system negotiated quality of
deliverables.

696

The technical quality of artifacts
Application. Technical quality is practically identical to quality as conformance
to requirements. It applies to “artifacts”, physical as well as service-,
information-, and administrative products that are intentionally conceived,
designed and produced and thereby the results of goal-oriented action. Things
other than artifacts may be outcomes of blind evolution, unintended
consequences, results of collective action, or emergent processes. Thus the
question of “quality of life” boils down to the question: is “life” an artifact,
sufficiently defined and described before it happens? If it is not, technical
quality considerations are not applicable.
The relation. In the world of artifacts the perennial question is the
relation between designer and design, the workman and his product, the
idea and its embodiment, engineering specifications and the actual output,
or the promise of service and the actual delivery. This relation is technical
quality and can be described in terms of deviation from a given target. It
is different from customer needs-based definitions in that the actual
product or service is not juxtaposed to needs, but to the explicit intentions
of its creators.
The actors. Technical quality is in the realm of producers,
customers-as-users and regulators. The ex ante specifications of artifacts
may be derived from creative ideas, research, generalized understanding of
market preferences, specifications supplied by a customer, or regulatory
initiatives.
Relation to time. Technical quality presupposes ex ante information about
targets and probabilities of achieving them, and ex post information about past
events. Comparing ex ante with ex post information constitutes the foundation
of cybernetic control and single-loop learning (Argyris and Schön, 1978; Sitkin
et al., 1994).
Upside and downside. Technical quality is based on the assumptions that an
intentional design is better than an unintentional, a controlled production
process is better and cheaper than one exhibiting uncontrolled variation, and
that error-free output is preferred over defectives. Since conformance to
specifications is usually expected, technical quality is chiefly concerned with
the downside; exceeding requirements does not necessarily carry any
commercial value. Deviations from ex ante explicit targets lead to losses,
calculable as the cost of poor quality.
In sum, technical quality indicates the relation between intentions and
outcomes, that is, the degree of conformance to specifications expressed as

<-----Page 6----->variation. It is the most narrowly focused and parsimonious aspect of quality
and supported by quality engineering methods, standards and accreditation
systems. However, it is applicable only to situations involving artifacts with
given or undisputed requirements known ex ante. It thereby belongs to the
world of objectivist epistemology, rational functionalism and closed systems.

697
The negotiated quality of deliverables
Application. Open system quality applies to “deliverables”. These may be any
identifiable entities that can be owned, consumed, and evaluated in relation to
some purpose, or to paraphrase Juran (1988), have a variable degree of fitness
for use. Deliverables are produced in more or less open systems. They are
conceived and produced for a customer or other recipient, real or imagined, in
order to fulfill a need that is not fully articulated ex ante. Such situations are
common in services, such as healthcare and tourism. As the service process
proceeds, customers become aware of further or different requirements and
may demand a renegotiation of the initial targets. A deliverable is usually
organized around an artifact, such as a scheduled flight and pre-defined hotel
accommodation, but also includes negotiable elements, such as personal
attention, appropriate measures to unexpected events, and suddenly changed
requirements concerning, say, food, entertainment or security. A deliverable
includes emergent processes as well as unintended consequences.
For analytical purposes two restrictions must be postulated. First,
negotiated quality is assumed to happen in an area of price indifference.
This excludes price-quality trade-offs that may be influenced by specific
transaction contexts, such as monopolistic pricing or fluctuations in supply and
demand. Second, it applies only to functionally equivalent deliverables that are
real alternatives to a customer or a client. The choice between different
deliverables for different purposes and performance levels, such as between
100 and 500 horsepower diesel engines, is not a quality issue.
The relation. In open systems quality is not only conformance to
requirements but also an expression of requisite variety (Ashby, 1956).
While variation is an expression of the difference between targets and actual
output, variety is a measure of the number of functionally equivalent
alternatives available to a customer within a given price range. While variation
is the difference between the recipe and the actually served meal, variety is the
range of choice between different meals. Thus negotiated quality is the
difference between the variety set a producer can offer and the variety set
customers may require. A production system is said to exhibit requisite variety
if the offered variety is equal to or larger than the required variety.
Actors. The principal actors in negotiated quality are the
customer-as-chooser and the producer, often the front-line employee
interacting with customers. Choices are not assumed to be fully rational;
both parties may operate under conditions of bounded rationality, information

<-----Page 7----->IJQRM
20,6

698

asymmetry, or opportunism (Williamson, 1985), or have highly subjective or
situational perceptions about the deliverables.
Time. Negotiated quality is primarily a concern of the ex nunc present
situation of choice.
Upside and downside. The assumption is that choosers prefer deliverables
that are suited to their needs and tastes. If there is, say, only one type of car
available in a given price bracket, a number of buyers are forced to accept
sub-optimal solutions to their needs. If there are 100 models available in the
same price category, the probability of a good fit is higher. In contrast to
technical quality where requirements are known ex ante, negotiated quality
does not imply prior knowledge of all aspects or consequences of a choice.
Therefore the cost of poor quality includes the consequences of choices that,
after the fact, turn out to be inappropriate. Since quality has been defined in an
interaction between producers and consumers, the question of who is
responsible for the downside becomes most crucial.
In sum, negotiated quality is a measure of the fit between the variety of
deliverables and the variety of customer requirements in open systems. It is
applicable only to functionally equivalent deliverables subject to choice under
conditions of price indifference. Technical quality of artifacts and negotiated
quality of deliverables are ideal types that form a continuum. Negotiations may
be closed after consensus has been reached; thereafter quality becomes a
technical issue of fulfilling agreed requirements. A technical quality production
process may be contested and opened to negotiation through reclamations or
product liability lawsuits. Products and services have several quality
characteristics that can be a mix of artifacts and deliverables. In practice,
certain characteristics, such as basic designs, safety and security behave as
non-negotiable artifacts while some other characteristics, such as comfort,
appearance and durability are open to negotiation to a varying degree. This
framework can now be applied to the question of the quality of information.
Information quality
The quality of information as artifacts
Information as an artifact. The producer of information has an intention to
produce a symbolic representation of certain entities or events, put it into a
context, assign it a pre-defined meaning and transmit it to a receiver. The
expectation is that the receiver will capture the meaning as intended. If the
transmission is repeated with some regularity, it turns into an information
process. Order-to-delivery systems are often of this kind.
Technical quality is the relationship between intention and outcome. A
precondition is that the producer is capable of ex ante evaluating the outcome,
which presupposes pre-defined and shared understanding about the intended
use of the information. Technical quality of information thus is the relationship
between a symbolic representation as defined by a producer and the

<-----Page 8----->corresponding representation of a receiver. Treating information as an artifact
assumes that truth conditions such as reliability, accuracy, coverage and
density, are known and agreed upon in advance, symbols have standardized
meanings, and contexts are fixed. Thus information-as-an-artifact is of good
quality if it is communicated in a way that the receiver captures the intention of
the sender. The technical quality of information can be analyzed and improved
with the tools of semiotics and communication theory (Wigand et al., 1997).
Upside and downside value. The technical quality of artifacts is fully defined
by comparing intent and outcome. Whether the receiver takes appropriate
action or not is not an information quality issue. The downside of technical
information quality takes two distinct forms. A piece of information may not fit
into its assigned contextual slot; it might be an outlier, a recording error, or
represent an unanticipated freak event and thereby be rejected. Alternatively a
piece of information may fit into context and be easily identified, but still be a
false representation of reality. For example, electronic order receiving and
handling systems usually have predetermined data fields that accept only a
certain type or range of data, representing available models, colors, or options.
A true customer request for, say, a color that is not available, will be rejected.
On the other hand, there may be a situation where the customer actually
wanted a blue, but for some reason the code for red was entered. An
information quality error happens and a loss can be calculated.
The quality of information as deliverable
Communicative acts. A deliverable is defined through negotiations between
producer and receiver. Under conditions of price indifference the receiver
selects and priority orders the available deliverables based on subjective
criteria or negotiates with the intention to achieve optimal fitness for use.
Information as a deliverable emerges from a communicative structure, usually
an informal, open system setting, where the truth conditions of data, relevance
of contexts, suitability of knowledge and appropriateness of meanings are
negotiated. Following Habermas (1998) a communicative act is subject to four
validity claims. The speaker must utter something intelligibly so that the
speaker and hearer can comprehend one another. The speaker must have an
intention to communicate a true proposition so that the hearer can share the
knowledge of the speaker. The speaker must want to express her intentions
truthfully, so that the hearer can trust her. Finally, the speaker must choose an
utterance that is right with respect to prevailing norms and values so that both
parties can agree with one another. Thus information-as-a-deliverable can be
assumed to be of good quality if the data content is true representation, the
context is valid and represents a sufficient amount of variety, and meaning can
be attributed to it with a degree of intersubjective consensus and in a way that
is perceived as useful. Good quality of information-as-a-deliverable is shared
understanding. The downside consists of unintentional misunderstandings,

going to an argumentative level of communication, switching to strategic
action, or breaking off the communication altogether.
Returning to the accounting example and the M ¼ f ðD; CÞ equation, the two
types of information can be clarified. An accounting system produces
pre-defined categories of numbers representing the performance of a firm. They
constitute the (D) in the equation and can be assigned quality characteristics
such as accuracy, reliability, and level of detail. It should be noted that the data
input (D) is the product of an accounting system, i.e. an information production
process, and from the perspective of that process it is information, not data: one
man’s information is another man’s data. The accounting system can be viewed
as a production process that may or may not have the capability to produce
high quality data every time.
The context (C) can be defined narrowly as only the accounting system and
the performances it represents. To a detached observer, such as the statistics
bureau, this might be sufficient. However, for agents with stakes in the
company, the context needs to be expanded and made richer. Details about
market conditions, competitors, and technology development may add more
perspective. An astute analyst would tap into informal sources for gossips
about owners, investors and boardroom battles. Further, an actor would also
need some knowledge ( f) about the workings of accounting practices,
competitive forces and likely decision-making patterns. Thus the meaning of
the same piece of data may vary significantly depending on context and
knowledge. Once meaning has been assigned it becomes possible to take action,
such as buying or selling shares. In this sense, information gets a “social life”
(Brown and Duguid, 2000).
Information-as-an-artifact, running through formal channels, can be
treated as any artifact traded in a market and subjected to comparisons
and evaluations. Formal information is usually not traded in discrete lots,
but in streams or information systems. For example, two performance
measurement systems including sensors, processors, software and displays
can be compared as to which gives more accurate, timely or accessible
information. A somewhat less formal information stream is, for example,
the subscription of a newspaper or an Internet account. The buyer here is
not like a customer in an information spot-market choosing between pieces
of information, rather like an investor selecting a portfolio of exposure. The
information investors do not have complete ex ante information of the
singular information items; therefore they are entering a principal-agent
relationship with an information provider.
Information-as-open-system deliverables is difficult to put into formalized
exchange relations (MacDonald, 1998). The quality of information depends on
the meaning assigned to it; the value of information depends on the actions it
enables in given situations equipped with certain resources and capabilities. In
order to know what information is valuable to your partner, you need to know

<-----Page 10----->what she knows and does not know. Therefore information-as-deliverables
tends to run in informal networks that are administered as barter trade: “my
information for your information”. As MacDonald (1998) has argued, a great
deal of the truly valuable information is moving in such informal exchanges.

The quality of
information

Summary and conclusion
In this article quality has been defined as a bi-polar construct, where the one
end is technical quality applied to artifacts, the other being interactive quality
of deliverables produced as results of negotiations between products and
customers. In practice, products and services are most often combinations of
elements, part artifact, part results of negotiations. This definition is based on
the assumption that the essence of quality is a matter of information and
knowledge: who defines quality at what point of time with what kind of
authority, power or justification.
The quality of information can be approached using the distinction of
information-as-artifacts, and information-as-deliverables. The former can be
subject to technical quality considerations involving assessments of variation,
i.e. the difference between true conditions and their symbolic representations.
The latter can be studied as negotiated quality, where a variety of inputs is
used to negotiate meanings.
While the development of a workable methodology for assessing and
measuring the quality of information is beyond the scope of this article, a few
suggestions can be made. First, as usual in organization research, the unit of
analysis or the system level under scrutiny must be defined clearly. It should
include the actors, individuals, teams or offices, that take part in information
exchanges and communicative acts used to initiate, guide, and control business
processes. Second, from the perspective of information exchange the crucial
question is whether the receiver captures the intended meaning (M) of the
sender, or to what extent the actors can develop shared meanings. Third, the
data (D) should be taken as an artifact and checked for quality attributes, such
as accuracy, reliability or readability. If (D) appears to be a problem, it may be
advisable to fix it first. Fourth, how do the actors understand the relevant
context? Contexts can be studied in various ways, such as corporate culture,
availability of resources, time constraints, business and technology cycles,
corporate visions or competitive conditions. Fifth, the knowledge function ( f)
could be examined. Do the actors have similar or different knowledge of how
the world works? Finally, if (D), (C), and ( f) are found to be reasonably
congruent among actors, but the meanings still are very different, it may be
appropriate to focus on tacit knowledge and motivational factors.
A significant amount of research is needed to develop meaningful tools to
analyze the quality of information. Since the question of negotiated meanings
easily gets dragged down into endless philosophical disputes surrounding
phenomenology, sensemaking, and subjectivism, some restrictions should be

701

<-----Page 11----->IJQRM
20,6

postulated from the start. Research should initially be concerned only with
information and information flows in rather well-defined organizational
processes where the number of players is restricted, activities have an aim, and
established performance indicators can be used. Initially, at least, consensus
about overall goals and shared values should be assumed.
