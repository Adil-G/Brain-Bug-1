INITIALTRUSTFORMATIONIN NEW
ORGANIZATIONAL
RELATIONSHIPS

Arguably, the most critical time frame for organizational participants to develop trust
is at the beginning of their relationship. Using primarily a cognitive approach, we
address factors and processes that enable two organizational parties to form relatively high trust initially. We propose a model of specific relationships among several
trust-related constructs and two cognitive processes. The model helps explain the
paradoxical finding of high initial trust levels in new organizational relationships.

Several trust theorists have stated that trust
develops gradually over time (e.g., Blau, 1964;
Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985; Zand, 1972), but
when contrasted with some recent empirical
findings, their theories present an interesting
paradox. By positing that trust grows over time,
these trust theorists implicitly assume that trust
levels start small and gradually increase. Some
researchers, then, expecting this, have been surprised at how high their subjects' early trust
levels were-both
in survey and experimental
studies (e.g., Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 1995;
Kramer, 1994). For example, economics-based researchers Berg et al. (1995) expected subjects to
exhibit low to medium trust in each other when
faced with a trust dilemma. Instead, their subjects frequently exhibited high trust-passing
to
a second subject dollars they were given during
the first part of the experiment, without any reason to expect their generosity to be reciprocated.
Another example is Kramer's (1994) survey of
MBAs who were previously unknown to each
other. Because the MBAs had no interaction history, one would have expected them to have low
trust levels; however, surprisingly,
Kramer
found high trust levels among these individuals.

Curley, Fred Davis, Gerald Smith, and Aks Zaheer for their

THEORETICALBACKGROUND
The Paradox of High Initial Trust Levels
High initial trust findings are paradoxical because, as we stated above, several trust theorists predict low initial trust. By "initial" we
mean when parties first meet or interact. An
example of initial trust predictions is provided
by economics- or calculative-based
trust researchers (e.g., Coleman, 1990; Williamson,
1993), who theorize that individuals make trust
choices based on rationally derived costs and
benefits (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992). Thus, calculativebased trust theorists would predict that the lack
of incentives (benefits) of Berg et al.'s subjects
would result in low levels of trusting behavior
among them. However, Berg et al.'s results do
not agree with this prediction. As another example, knowledge-based
trust theorists propose
that trust develops over time as one accumulates trust-relevant knowledge through experience with the other person (Holmes, 1991;
Lewicki & Bunker, 1995). From this perspective,
Kramer's study participants would require time
and an interaction history to develop a high
level of trust in each other. However, Kramer's
results directly contradict this. Thus, studying
initial trust formation is important, because the
results from such studies require an explanation
beyond what calculative-based and knowledgebased trust theories provide.
In this article we argue that the paradox of
high trust in initial relationships may be ex-

plained by identifying "hidden" factors and processes that enable trust to be high when people
in organizations first meet. We develop a model
of initial trust formation to explain why trust
may be high when members of organizations
barely know each other.
Increasingly

Common New Work Relationships

In today's work environment, interacting with
a new manager or with new coworkers is becoming commonplace. Such a situation involves
initial trust, because the parties have not
worked together long enough to develop an interaction history. Initial trust situations occur
naturally, when an employee or manager is
newly hired or transferred, when cross-functional teams are formed, when salespeople or
consultants call, when mergers bring two sets of
employees together, or when a new joint venture
begins.
These situations are becoming more common
because of increased mergers or acquisitions
and because widespread corporate restructuring and reduced employee loyalty have increased the typical turnover rate of organizational workers and managers (e.g., Evans, Gunz,
& Jalland, 1996). The nature of tasks is also increasing new work encounters, as temporary
task teams or project engagements become the
Meyerson, Weick, &
norm in organizations.
Kramer (1996) explain that such environmental
factors as outsourcing and labor/skill shortages
have increased the number of temporary task
teams. Further, communication technology now
enables millions of people (Henry & Hartzler,
1997) to work on virtual task teams (Lipnack &
Stamps, 1997), in which participants are often
new to each other.
Because working together well requires some
level of trust (Bromiley & Cummings, 1995), increasingly common new work encounters demand that the parties come to trust each other
quickly (Meyerson et al., 1996). Thus, the need
exists for a model of how trust initially forms.
A Model of Initial Trust Formation
Initial trust between parties will not be based
on any kind of experience with, or firsthand
knowledge of, the other party. Rather, it will be
based on an individual's disposition to trust or
on institutional cues that enable one person to

July

trust another without firsthand knowledge. Figure 1 depicts the initial trust formation model.
The model applies only to new encounters between people. Therefore, it excludes experiential processes (e.g., observing the trustees' behavior), but it does include cognitive processes
and factors that lead to initial trust. As we explain in the next section, the model uses constructs from four trust research streams.
We define "trust" to mean that one believes in,
and is willing to depend on, another party (e.g.,
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). This highlevel trust concept can be broken into two constructs: (1) trusting intention, meaning that one
is willing to depend on the other person in a
given situation (e.g., Currall & Judge, 1995), and
(2) trusting beliefs, meaning that one believes
the other person is benevolent, competent, honest, or predictable in a situation (Mayer et al.,
1995).
Distinguishing two constructs that constitute
trust is important, because the word "trust" is so
confusing (Shapiro, 1987a) and broad (Williamson, 1993) that it almost defies careful definition
(e.g., Gambetta, 1988). The distinction between
trusting beliefs and trusting intention follows
the Fishbein & Ajzen (1975) typology separating
constructs into beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and
behaviors. We exclude attitudes and behaviors
here so we can focus the article on cognitive
concerns.
At a summary level, the model (Figure 1) implies that trust forms because of one's disposition to trust, one's institution-based trust, and
two cognitive processes we discuss later. "Disposition to trust" refers to a tendency to be willing to depend on others. "Institution-based
trust" means that one believes impersonal structures support one's likelihood for success in a
given situation. To avoid the vagueness of discussing the formation of the broad trust concept,
we use the model to explore the specific formation of trusting intention and trusting beliefs.
Theoretical Foundations for the Initial Trust
Model
A significant body of knowledge from five research streams sheds light on how initial trust
and
forms. In addition to knowledge-based
calculative-based trust research, three other research streams have been used: (1) personality
based, (2) institution based, and (3) cognition

based. According to personality-based trust researchers, trust develops during childhood as
an infant seeks and receives help from his or her
benevolent caregiver (Bowlby, 1982; Erikson,
1968), resulting in a general tendency to trust
others (Rotter, 1967). Institution-based trust researchers maintain that trust reflects the security one feels about a situation because of guarantees, safety nets, or other structures (Shapiro,
1987a; Zucker, 1986). Cognition-based trust researchers purport that trust relies on rapid, cognitive cues or first impressions, as opposed to
personal interactions (Brewer, 1981; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985b; Meyerson et al., 1996).
The personality-, institution-, and cognitionbased research streams each can help explain
the paradox of high initial trust levels. Personality-based trust theorists, for example, would
say that subjects in Kramer's study with a high
disposition to trust would have high initial trust.
However, this may not explain the overall high
level of trust, because it is unlikely that nearly
all of Kramer's subjects had high disposition-totrust levels. Institution-based theorists would
argue that the structure of the classroom situation supported high levels of initial trust by en-

\

Trustin

abling subjects to feel secure in the situation
(e.g., Lewis & Weigert, 1985a; Shapiro, 1987a).
Kramer himself used a cognitive explanation for
his results, attributing high trust levels to the
favorable views the MBAs had toward those of
their own kind.
Each of these three trust research streams can
partially explain high initial trust, but if we focus on only one of the three, we face the danger
of the other two acting as hidden confounds. The
danger of hidden confounds exists because,
in a given context, all three types of factorspersonality, institutional, and cognitive-may
be present. Sitkin and Pablo (1992) demonstrated
this with respect to the prediction of risk behavior; they identified a hidden personality-related
construct (risk propensity) that explained the
paradoxical empirical results researchers found
when predicting risk behavior with situational
and organizational variables. By identifying the
hidden construct, Sitkin and Pablo were able
to specify more fully the antecedents of risk
behavior.
To explain the paradox of high initial trust, we
will justify the initial trust formation model (Figure 1), based on the detailed constructs and pro-

cesses in Figure 2. The detailed model's constructs and processes come from four of the
five research streams mentioned above (see
Figure 2): (1) personality (faith in humanity),
(2) institutional (institution-based trust), (3) calculative (trusting stance), and (4) cognitive
(categorization processes and illusions of control process). Trusting beliefs and trusting intention come from more than one research
stream. The fifth research stream-knowl-

that the parties
trust-assumes
edge-based
have firsthand knowledge of each other, based
on an interaction history. Because "initial relationships," by definition, have no interaction
trust does
history, firsthand knowledge-based
not apply to them. Hence, firsthand knowledge-based trust formation processes lie outside the scope of this article. We address second-hand knowledge, such as reputation, as a
categorization process.

<-----Page 5----->1998

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

We chose the model's four trusting beliefs because they are the most commonly used trusting
beliefs in the literature (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995).
Each trusting belief is proposed to be more
highly correlated with other trusting beliefs
than with the model's other constructs, indicating a type of convergent validity. The constructs
in institution-based trust and disposition to trust
also display convergent validity. Trusting beliefs are proposed to be more highly related to
trusting intention than they are to institutionbased trust and disposition to trust, as reflected
by the box grouping them together as a composite trust concept.
We define the model's constructs at the individual level of analysis. Hence, the model's constructs are internally consistent, even though
one set of constructs (institution-based trust) reflects group- or organization-level phenomena.
In limiting the article's scope to the individual
level of analysis, we are not disallowing social
and organizational effects. In fact, we believe
organizational-level
constructs affect trust.
However, these lie outside the scope of the
article.
Our primary contribution is in creating a
model that explains why trust can be high initially. But the model also addresses a second
paradox. Although trust frequently has been
termed "fragile" (e.g., Worchel, 1979), it has also
been described as "robust" (e.g., Luhmann, 1979).
An added contribution is that we discuss the
model's implications for understanding
why
trust is considered both fragile and robust. We
include research implications for the model in
the last section of the article.

A MODEL EXPLAINING THE HIGH INITIAL
TRUST PARADOX
Disposition to Trust Affects Trusting Beliefs
and Trusting Intention
A person exhibits a disposition to trust to the
extent that she or he demonstrates a consistent
tendency to be willing to depend on others
across a broad spectrum of situations and persons-a personality construct that builds on the
work of Erikson (1968) and Rotter (1967, 1971,
1980). In contrast to others, we distinguish between two types of disposition to trust, each of
which affects trusting intention in a different
way: (1) faith in humanity and (2) trusting stance.

477

Reflecting the traditional view of personalitybased trust, "faith in humanity" means that one
believes that others are typically well-meaning
and reliable (e.g., Rosenberg, 1957; Wrightsman,
1991). "Trusting stance" means that one believes
that, regardless of whether people are reliable
or not, one will obtain better interpersonal outcomes by dealing with people as though they
are well-meaning and reliable. Because it reflects a conscious choice, trusting stance derives
from the calculative-based
trust research
stream (e.g., Riker, 1971). As an example of trusting stance, one of the authors asked a respondent if she trusted her new manager, who had
just been hired from outside the company. She
replied "yes," explaining that she generally
trusts new people until they give her some reason not to trust them. Hence, she exhibited a
personal strategy to trust newcomers. Both faith
in humanity and trusting stance are "dispositional," which refers to personal tendencies, not
traits, because they reflect tendencies that apply across various situations.
Mixed empirical findings. Researchers have
experienced mixed results when using disposition to trust to predict trust. From their research,
Johnson-George and Swap conclude that constructs like disposition to trust "do not accurately determine an individual's trust in another
under particular circumstances" (1982: 1307). In
contrast, others have found disposition-related
constructs to be important predictors. For example, Goldsteen, Schorr, and Goldsteen (1989)
found that disposition-related trust had a statistically significant effect on peoples' mistrust of
federal nuclear plant authorities whom they did
not know personally. Mayer et al. (1995) reviewed additional evidence that dispositionbased trust is important to other trust constructs.
However, Holmes (1991) declares that although
researchers assume disposition to trust is a contributor to the development
of relationshipspecific trust, this link has not been proven.
Resolving the research findings. We can resolve these mixed results by using our initial
trust model. The time frame of the relationship is
important in predicting the effects of disposition
to trust. Although other variables will swamp
the effects of a person's trusting tendency in
ongoing relationships, disposition to trust likely
will have a significant effect on a person's trusting beliefs and trusting intention in new organizational relationships.

Swap cite evidence that disposition to trust predicts what they call "trusting behavior" only
when parties are new to each other in "highly
ambiguous, novel, or unstructured situations,
where one's generalized expectancy is all one
can rely on" (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982: 1307;
cf., Rotter, 1980). A transferred worker's relationship with a new manager in an unfamiliar area
exemplifies such a situation, because roles and
relationships are not yet clear. Goldsteen et al.'s
dispositional trust was re(1989) finding-that
lated to specific trust of federal authorities indithe idea that
viduals had never met-supports
dispositional trust is salient when people do not
know each other.
Faith in humanity effects. Because faith in
humanity reflects the extent to which one believes that nonspecific others are trustworthy,
this characteristic will probably affect one's initial trusting beliefs (Kramer, 1994). Alreadydeveloped patterns of thinking about relationships in general tend to transfer to a specific
initial relationship. This is particularly true if an
individual cannot draw on other reasons (e.g.,
trusting beliefs or institution-based trust), because the situation, the type of relationship, and
the type of other person are new. In other words,
if no more specific situational information is
available, one will rely on one's basic beliefs
about human nature (Wrightsman, 1991), as reflected in faith in humanity. This is similar to the
argument, presented by Mullins and Cummings,
that "weak situations" display ambiguity in
terms of the meaning of the situation (in press).
In weak situations the person's disposition will
be more salient than the situation. Initial trustrelated situations may be ambiguous because
the parties' roles or task may be new. Rotter
(1971) has said that the novelty of the situation
affects how salient dispositional trust will be. In
a novel situation, then, faith in humanity will
enable trusting beliefs to be high.
Proposition 1: In the initial relationship, to the extent the situation is
novel and ambiguous, faith in humanity will lead to trusting beliefs.
Trusting stance effects. Trusting stance influences one to be intentionally willing to depend
on another, regardless of beliefs in the other. An
individual with high trusting stance probably
believes that things turn out best when one is
willing to depend on others, even though others

may or may not be trustworthy. Thus, trusting
stance does not lead to beliefs about the other
person; rather, it directly supports one's willingness to depend on that person.
Proposition 2: In the initial relationship, trusting stance will lead to trusting intention. The effects of trusting
stance on trusting intention will not be
mediated by trusting beliefs.
Institution-Based
Intention

Trust Affects Trusting

trust means that one beInstitution-based
lieves the necessary impersonal structures are
in place to enable one to act in anticipation of a
successful future endeavor (e.g., Shapiro, 1987a;
Zucker, 1986). Trusting intention at the beginning of a relationship may be high because of
high institution-based trust levels. In the literature two types of institution-based trust are discussed: (1) situational normality, defined as the
belief that success is likely because the situation is normal, and (2) structural assurances,
defined as the belief that success is likely because such contextual conditions as promises,
contracts, regulations, and guarantees are in
place. Later, we discuss the effects of institutionbased trust on trusting beliefs. In this section we
look at direct effects on trusting intention.
Situational normality belief effects. Situational normality belief stems from the appearance that things are normal (Garfinkel, 1963: 188)
or "customary" (Baier, 1986: 245), or that "everything seems in proper order" (Lewis & Weigert,
1985a: 974). Situational normality involves a
properly ordered setting that appears likely to
facilitate a successful interaction. For example,
a person who enters a bank tends to expect a
setting conducive to both customer service and
fiduciary responsibility that is reflected in the
workers' professional appearance, the prospersetting, and the
ous and secure physical
friendly, yet safe, money-handling procedures.
The individual's belief that the situation is normal helps that person feel comfortable enough
to rapidly form a trusting intention toward the
other party in the situation.
Garfinkel's experiments, in contrast, demonstrated that when people face inexplicable, abnormal situations, trust between them breaks
down. For example, one subject told the experi-

<-----Page 7----->1998

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

menter he had a flat tire on the way to work. The
experimenter responded, "What do you mean,
you had a flat tire?" (1963: 221). At this point trust
broke down because of the experimenter's illogical question.
Situational normality also can relate to one's
comfort with one's own roles and the other person's roles in that setting (Baier, 1986). Socially
constructed roles create a shared understanding
among members of the social system that facilitates trusting intention among them.
Proposition 3: In the initial relationship, situational normality belief will
lead to trusting intention.
Structural assurance belief effects. Shapiro refers to structural safeguards in terms of institutional "side bets" (1987b: 204), such as regulations, guarantees, and legal recourse.

. Regulationsenable people to feel assured
about their expectations of the other party's
future behavior (e.g., Sitkin, 1995).For example, a company subcontracting the construction of metric-sized engine parts relies on
the other party to use the same measures
the company itself uses since they are specified by well-accepted metric standards
makers.
* Guaranteesmitigate the perceived risk involved in forming trusting intention. Hence,
structural assurance belief leads to trusting
intention, as evidenced by Zaheer, McEvily,
and Perrone's (in press) finding that structure-based trust is positively related to interpersonal trust.
. Legal recourse(i.e., regarding contracts or
promises) is related to trusting intention for
two reasons (Baier, 1986).First, the trustor
feels comfortable that the promise has the
type of significance in the particular setting
so that the trusted person will make every
effort to fulfill it, or risk reaping sanctions
through social disapproval or legal action
(e.g., Sitkin, 1995).Second, the trustor feels
comfortable that the trusted person, out of
either socially learned behavior patterns or
fear of sanctions, will act according to the
norms surrounding promise in the social
setting.
Structural assurance belief will be more influential in the initial relationship than it will later,
because information about the other person is
very incomplete when the relationship begins,
making situational information quite salient.
Proposition 4: In the initial relationship, structural assurance belief will
lead to trusting intention.

479

Structural Assurance Belief and Situational
Normality Belief Affect Trusting Beliefs
Structural assurance belief is likely to affect
trusting beliefs for three reasons, the last two of
which are shared by situational normality belief. First, believing that a situation is bounded
by safeguards enables one to believe that the
individuals in the situation are trustworthy. For
example, a new employee can better believe in
the boss's benevolence if the employee believes
the workplace has procedures that punish abusive managerial treatment. Also, an employee is
more likely to believe a new coworker is competent if that individual believes the department's
hiring process is sound.
Second, the institutions in the situation reflect
the actions of the people involved; therefore,
beliefs about the institutions will help form beliefs about the people who are involved in the
institutions. For example, within the bounds set
by corporate practices and procedures, the boss
is the chief administrator of fairness in the workplace. Thus, one's belief about the structures
supporting fairness in the workplace will support one's belief in the boss's benevolence. Similarly, a situational normality belief implies that
the people in the situation will act normally and
can therefore be trusted.
Third, based on many studies of cognitive consistency (Abelson et al., 1968), we believe that
structural assurance and situational normality
beliefs will probably stay consistent with related beliefs, such as trusting beliefs. Cognitive
consistency is probably even more salient during the initial relationship, before beliefs about
the other person and the situation become
through experiential
highly differentiated
knowledge (Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
Proposition 5: In the initial relationship, the trusting beliefs will be a
function of structural assurance belief
and situational normality belief.
Trusting Beliefs Affect Trusting Intention
Evidence for the link between trusting beliefs
and trusting intention is reviewed elsewhere
(Mayer et al., 1995). Dobing (1993) also found a
strong relationship between his trusting beliefs
and trust (willingness to depend) constructs.
Logically, if one believes that the other party is
benevolent, competent, honest, and predictable,

<-----Page 8----->480

Academy of Management

one is likely to form a trusting intention toward
that person. Therefore, trusting beliefs will positively impact trusting intention.
At a more general level, the literature that
links beliefs to intentions supports this relationship (e.g., Davis, 1989; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).
Ajzen (1988) discusses evidence that beliefs and
intentions tend to stay consistent. They should
be especially consistent at first, when one has
no experiential basis not to believe the other
person is trustworthy.
Proposition 6: In the initial relationship, trusting intention will be a function of benevolence
belief, competence belief, honesty belief, and
predictability belief.
Faith in Humanity and Trusting Stance Affect
Structural Assurance Belief
Faith in humanity reflects one's lifelong experiences with others (e.g., Rotter, 1967). A person
who believes in the honesty and benevolence of
people generally will probably have stronger
beliefs in the security afforded by human institutions. Stated another way, one's structural assurance belief is probably partly based on how
one feels about people in general, because people play roles that relate to how secure the situation is. Hence, one's feelings about people in
general will likely influence one's structural assurance belief. This is more likely to be true at
the beginning of a relationship, when beliefs
about the situation are based more on assumptions than on facts.
Trusting stance also will affect initial structural assurance belief. An individual with high
trusting stance believes that trusting others facilitates success, regardless of his or her beliefs
about specific people. This assumption is consistent with a perception that safeguards or
safety nets will protect the individual involved
from bad consequences other people cause. In
other words, developing a high level of structural assurance belief is facilitated when one
has a high level of trusting stance. When parties
first meet, the person's already-formed high
level of trusting stance will tend to encourage a
corresponding high level of structural assurance belief. Over time, the relationship between
these constructs may be reciprocal, but at the
initial meeting, a person will rely on his or her

Review

prior tendencies, in terms of trusting stance, to
form structural assurance belief.
Proposition 7: In the initial relationship, faith in humanity and trusting
stance will lead to structural assurance belief.
Categorization Processes Enable High Levels
of Trusting Beliefs
In a new relationship a person may use three
types of categorization processes to develop
trusting beliefs: (1) unit grouping, (2) reputation
categorization, and (3) stereotyping. "Unit grouping" means to put the other person in the same
category as oneself. "Reputation categorization"
means that one assigns attributes to another
person based on second-hand information about
the person. "Stereotyping" means to place another person into a general category of persons.
Unit grouping.
Because
those who are
grouped together tend to share common goals
and values, they tend to perceive each other in a
positive light (Kramer, Brewer, & Hanna, 1996).
Hence, one group member will be more likely to
form trusting beliefs toward another group
member. For example, Zucker, Darby, Brewer,
and Peng (1996) found that being a member of
the same organization
the trust
generated
needed for scientists to collaborate on research.
In their study Brewer and Silver (1978) found that
people perceived in-group members to be more
trustworthy than out-group members. These
studies provide evidence that unit grouping
quickly leads to high levels of trusting beliefs.
As an example of the rapid effects of unit grouping, in studying prospective dating couples who
had never met, Darley and Berscheid (1967)
found that the knowledge that one would be
paired with the other tended to enhance the
former's beliefs about the latter's characteristics. Applied to a new task team, unit grouping
would enable one member to immediately form
trusting beliefs about another team member.
Reputation categorization. Those with good
reputations are categorized as trustworthy individuals. Reputation may reflect professional
competence (Barber, 1983; Powell, 1996) or the
other trusting beliefs: benevolence (Dasgupta,
1988), honesty, and predictability. A person may
be perceived as a competent individual because
she or he is a member of a competent group

<-----Page 9----->1998

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

(Dasgupta, 1988) or because of her or his actions.
Therefore, if the individual has a good reputation, one will quickly develop trusting beliefs
about that individual, even without firsthand
knowledge.
Stereotyping. Stereotyping may be done either
on a broad level, such as gender (e.g., Orbell,
Dawes, & Schwartz-Shea, 1994), or on a more
specific level, such as prejudices for or against
occupational groups (e.g., used-car salespeople). At their first meeting, parties may form
stereotypes about each other, based on voice
(e.g., male/female or domestic/foreign; Baldwin,
1992) or physical appearance (Dion, Berscheid, &
Walster, 1972; Riker, 1971). By positive stereotyping, one can quickly form positive trusting beliefs about the other by generalizing from the
favorable category into which the person was
placed.
Proposition 8: In the initial relationship, categorization
processes that
place the other person in a positive
grouping will tend to produce high
levels of trusting beliefs.
Illusions of Control Process: Interactive Effects
That Elevate Trusting Beliefs
Here we explain why the illusions of control
process will interact with categorization processes, faith in humanity, and structural assurance belief to produce high levels of trusting
beliefs. People in an uncertain situation will
take small actions to try to assure themselves
that things are under their personal control
(Langer, 1975). This results in unrealistically inflated perceptions of personal control (Taylor &
Brown, 1988), which Langer (1975) terms "illusions of control." Illusions, obviously, involve
perceptions that differ from reality, and considerable evidence demonstrates the presence of
illusion in cognitive processing (e.g., Fiske &
Taylor, 1984).
The illusions of control process that helps
build trusting beliefs may be similar to the process by which people become overconfident of
their judgments, as reported by Langer (1975)
and Paese and Sniezek (1991). First, one forms a
tentative belief, and then one watches for clues
that confirm the belief. Even without evidence,
the effort of watching tends to overinflate confidence in one's judgment (Davis & Kotteman,

481

1994). Similarly, even a slight effort at confirming one's tentative trusting beliefs in another
may overinflate one's confidence that high levels of trusting beliefs are warranted.
Token control efforts. People may make an
initial effort to think about another person's
trustworthiness, or they may, upon meeting a
person, immediately attempt to gauge whether
or not they can influence that person in some
small way (egg., make them smile). We term such
actions "token control efforts." One individual is
not trying to categorize the other but, rather, is
testing his or her ability to deal with the other
individual successfully.
Initially, a person is likely to use token control
efforts because she or he does not know from
experience whether or not the other has the attributes needed to be considered trustworthy.
After making such small control efforts, the individual may form an unjustifiably strong confidence that one's positive categorization, faith
in humanity, and structural assurance beliefs
are correct and, therefore, that the other person
is trustworthy. Langer (1975) for example, in a
study of overconfidence, found that token control
efforts to improve one's chances in a lottery (i.e.,
by choosing their own lottery ticket) made one
very overconfident of winning.
Trust theorists have posited that trust building involves illusion (Holmes, 1991; Meyerson et
al., 1996). The results of one empirical trust study
support this position. Kramer (1994) found that
ruminating for a few minutes about others' motives and intentions increased a person's confidence in the accuracy of his or her judgments of
the others. Mental assessments tend to increase
one's confidence because, as Langer (1975)
found, they move a task further from the realm of
chance and closer to the realm of a skill-based
judgment task. Hence, token control efforts can
support a person's confidence in trust-related
beliefs.
Interactive effects. We propose that token control efforts will interact with categorization
processes, faith in humanity, and structural
assurance belief, strengthening an individual's
capacity to form trusting beliefs. Token control
efforts will give a person the illusion that his or
her positive faith in humanity can apply to the
particular other party by convincing the individual that he or she is applying skill-not
just
a trust-related judgment of the
chance-to
other party. Similarly, token control efforts will

<-----Page 10----->482

(1) build confidence that one's positive categorization of the other person is correct, and (2) bolster confidence that structural safeguards make
the environment secure and, by association, the
people involved trustworthy.
Proposition 9: In the initial relationship,
token control efforts will strengthen
the tendency of categorization processes, faith in humanity, and structural assurance belief to produce high
levels of trusting beliefs.
MODEL IMPLICATIONS FOR TRUSTING
INTENTION FRAGILITY/ROBUSTNESS
Paradoxically, although trust often has been
termed "fragile" (e.g., Worchel, 1979), it has also
been described as "robust," in that it progresses
in upward spirals (e.g., Zand, 1972) or becomes
more fully developed over time (Gabarro, 1978;
Sitkin & Roth, 1993). Our model of initial trust
of
development improves our understanding
model's
ultiintention,
the
trusting
how initial
mate consequent, may be either fragile or robust
under different conditions.
Conditions Under Which Initial Trusting
Intention Is Likely to Be Fragile
Initial trusting intention is likely to be fragile
under three conditions: (1) inadequate support
from Figure 2's antecedent constructs, (2) the
nature of the
tentative and assumption-based
antecedent constructs, and (3) high perceived
risk. Fragile refers to a trusting intention level
that is likely to undergo large changes during a
given time frame. That is, as time passes and
conditions change, to what extent is the level of
trusting intention likely to change? Although researchers' use of the term "fragile" typically refers to a high trust level suddenly becoming low,
we define the term so that it could apply to
either high or low trust levels. At high levels,
fragile trust is subject to rapid decreases,
whereas at low levels, fragile trust is subject to
rapid increases. In either case fragile trust is
unstable, quickly changeable, or easily influenced.
Robust (the opposite of fragile) refers to a
trusting intention level that does not change
dramatically during a given time frame. As an
example of the difference between robust and

July

fragile, if a trusting intentions level were to
move downward dramatically, we would call it
fragile rather than robust.
Inadequate antecedent support. Intuitively,
the more highly positive antecedents trusting
intention has, the less fragile it will be; a weak
combination of trusting intention antecedents
will result in a fragile trusting intention. That is,
if trusting intention is associated with only one
highly positive antecedent, it is likely to change
downward soon after the initial period of a relationship.
For example, suppose a home buyer with a
low disposition to trust and low trusting beliefs
in the home builder enters into a contract to
have a house built, based on the belief that the
legal processes will provide a safety net (structural assurance belief). Further, the home buyer
has no cues by which to categorize the home
builder positively. In this situation the only
highly positive antecedent of trusting intention
is structural assurance belief. In such cases,
Dasgupta remarks that the trust one person has
in another to fulfill a contract rests precariously
upon the power of the agencies that are able to
enforce contracts: "If your trust in the enforcement agency falters, you will not trust persons to
fulfill their terms of an agreement and thus will
It is this internot enter into that agreement....
connectedness which makes trust such a fragile
commodity" (1988: 50). However, if the home
buyer's structural assurance belief is accompanied by trusting beliefs in the home builder, he
or she may be able to maintain trusting intention even when his or her structural assurance
belief wavers.
In general, then, when any particular antecedent of trusting intention is the only one at a high
level, trusting intention most likely will be fragile. For example, the home buyer's honesty belief is an antecedent of trusting intention that
can crumble quickly (Dasgupta, 1988), if the buyer's experience with the builder indicates that
the belief is mistaken. We previously discussed
how disposition to trust may be a weak trusting
intention antecedent in the presence of a strong
situation. The home buyer's high disposition to
trust will not hold up if he or she has reason to
believe that structural assurances are missing
or that the home builder may be dishonest. Sitbeliefs supporting
uation- or person-specific
trusting intention quickly become stronger than

<-----Page 11----->1998

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

dispositional support as the buyer gains experience with the situation.
Tentative, assumption-based
antecedents.
Trusting intention will be fragile at the start of a
relationship because of the tentative and assumption-based
nature of its antecedents
(Figure 2). Initial trust is not based so much on
evidence
as on lack of contrary evidence
(Gambetta, 1988). Illusions of control are almost
completely assumption based. If the illusion
crumbles, the constructs bolstered by it can
decrease rapidly, negatively affecting trusting
intention. Riker points out that stereotyping categorization is tentative because "only rarely do
[the applied categories] effectively discriminate
between the trustworthy and the untrustworthy"
(1971: 78). Hence, trusting beliefs (leading to
trusting intention) produced by categorization
are subject to abrupt corrections. Initial institution-based trust, founded on assumptions about
the situation, is subject to rapid deterioration as
facts become known. One's disposition to trust
assumes things will work out successfully, and
will only be salient until situational or personal
facts are uncovered (Johnson-George & Swap,
1982).
Experience supplies facts that can quickly
displace illusions and assumptions. Fazio and
Zanna (1981) point out two reasons for this. First,
people consider behavioral experience information to be more reliable than indirectly obtained
information. Further, more reliable information
reduces uncertainty, making it highly desirable
(Smith, Benson, & Curley, 1991). Second, an individual's direct experience in forming an attitude
or judgment makes that attitude more readily
accessible in his or her memory (cf., Riker, 1971:
78).
High perceived risk. Some risk is perceived
even when people trust each other (e.g., Mayer
et al., 1995). High levels of perceived risk make it
more likely that the trustor will pay attention to
the other's behavior, seeking validating information. Kramer (1996) found this to be true in
between students and faculty
relationships
members. The more one attends to new information about the other person, the more likely it is
that contrary evidence will be found, negatively
affecting trusting intention.
Proposition 10: In the initial relationship, high trusting intention is likely
to be very fragile when it is supported

483

by only one or two antecedents, when
it relies almost exclusively on assumptions, and when perceived risk is high.
Several of the above fragility examples demonstrate that the interdependent nature of the
model constructs is itself a reason trusting intention may be fragile. When one construct's
level is reduced, it is likely to negatively affect a
related construct. For example, whereas a decrease in trusting stance directly affects trusting
intention, it also affects institution-based trust.
Also, while institution-based trust will have a
direct effect on trusting intention, it will also
affect trusting intention through trusting beliefs.
Hence, the model portrays the possibility that
trusting intention is like the roof on the proverbial "house of cards," which collapses when one
structurally key antecedent slips.
Conditions Under Which Trusting Intention Is
Likely to Be Robust
Trusting intention is likely to be robust for
three reasons: (1) adequate antecedent support,
(2) belief-confirming cognitive mechanisms, and
(3) social mechanisms.
Adequate antecedent
support. Given our
the
most obvious reason trusting intenmodel,
tion will continue to be high is that, in many
cases, several of the antecedents shown in Figure 2 will exist at high levels. Further, it is more
probable that the antecedents will exist at a
consistently high level rather than in a combination of high and low levels. Researchers of
cognitive consistency have found evidence that
related beliefs tend to stay consistent with each
other because people keep their various cognitions reconciled (Abelson et al., 1968; Luhmann,
1979). Hence, for a given subject, we expect to
find relatively consistent levels among trust
constructs, especially as the relationship begins. A consistently high set of antecedents will
be less likely to cause a trusting intention dissolution than will an inconsistently high set.
For example, in a classroom setting it is likely
that, because of past experiences, students feel
comfortable with their own and the instructor's
roles (institution-based trust). Hence, the students probably have formed structural assurance beliefs within class situations generally.
Hopefully, they have heard enough about the
instructor's reputation so that, along with early

<-----Page 12----->484

Academy of Management Review

cues, they can categorize her or him as having
trustworthy attributes (e.g., competence), thus
forming one or more of the trusting beliefs. Under these circumstances, the students are likely
to have high initial trusting intention toward the
instructor. This trusting intention probably will
prove stable, given it is likely supported by
trusting beliefs and institution-based trust. Unless the instructor does something to seriously
violate the positive expectations a student develops from the initial class interaction, the
student's trusting intention is likely to endure
throughout the course. But trusting intention is
even more likely to stay high if the student also
has high disposition to trust, which will reinforce his or her institution-based trust and trusting beliefs. A person with a high disposition to
trust is more likely to see good points and to
overlook flaws in another person or situation
that would threaten high trusting intention levels by lowering trusting beliefs or institutionbased trust.
Belief-confirming cognitive mechanisms. Attentional cognitive processes play a role in sustaining initial trust. Not all information is attended to, and unless it is, it will not affect
trust-related constructs. Indeed, peoples' beliefs
and preconceived notions tend to filter the information they heed. Good (1988) remarks that evidence contrary to one's beliefs is seldom sought
and often ignored, citing psychological experimental evidence (e.g., Mitroff, 1974; Tajfel, 1969;
Wason, 1960) for this confirmation bias effect.
Similarly, Taylor and Brown cite evidence that
people "generally select, interpret, and recall
information to be consistent with their prior beliefs or theories (see Fiske & Taylor, 1984; Greenwald, 1980; Taylor & Crocker, 1981, for reviews)"
(1988: 202). The authors apply this effect to positive illusion-based beliefs: "Consequently, if a
person's prior beliefs are positive, cognitive biases that favor conservatism
generally will
maintain positive illusions more specifically"
(Taylor & Brown, 1988: 202). They cite additional
evidence that peoples' preconceptions
guide
which information they consider relevant and,
therefore, to which information they attend
(Howard & Rothbart, 1980; Nisbett & Ross, 1980).
Researchers
conducting empirical studies
have confirmed that much counterbelief evidence is simply ignored. An example is provided by Starbuck and Milliken's (1988) study of
the 1986 NASA Challenger disaster. The authors

July

found that NASA and Morton-Thiokol managers
ignored or explained away evidence that rocket
booster O-rings would erode in a low-temperature takeoff. Contrary evidence is especially ignored when people perceive things to be going
well. Sitkin, for example, states that "small successes may unintentionally induce low levels of
attention and reduced information search" (1992:
232). In contrast, "The greater the incidence of
small prior failure, the more attention will be
paid to and the more deeply will [be] the processing of information about potential problems" (Sitkin, 1992: 240).
The tendency to ignore counterbelief evidence
should be true of trusting beliefs as well as
other beliefs. However, in the initial relationship, the desire to feel assured through experiential evidence (Fazio & Zanna, 1981) will, to
some extent, mitigate this cognitive bias. This
desire will be heightened by low levels of disposition to trust or institution-based trust or by
high levels of perceived risk, because the person
will require additional assurances that his or
her initial beliefs are accurate.
When people do attend to information that
disconfirms their views, they often discount it as
inaccurate or uninformative (Markus, 1977; Ross
& Anderson, 1992; Swann & Read, 1981; Taylor &
Brown, 1988), or they reinterpret it positively
(Holmes, 1991; Robinson, 1996). Ross and Anderson point out that "beliefs ... are remarkably resilient in the face of empirical challenges that
seem logically devastating" (1982: 144). People
tend to accept belief-supportive information uncritically, but slowly acknowledge disconfirming evidence (Tetlock, 1985). Ross and Anderson
(1992) posit that people subject disconfirming
evidence to considerable scrutiny but do not go
back and update or re-evaluate evidence relevant to their beliefs based on disconfirming evidence. People also search their memories to
find ways of explaining their existing beliefs
(Ross & Anderson, 1982).
Similarly, Kahneman and Tversky (1973) found
significant evidence that people will interpret
ambiguous or incomplete information in a way
that agrees with their pre-existing beliefs. If one
has a high level of trusting intention toward
another, for example, then one can view specific
trust violations as isolated exceptions or as a
personal quirk (Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Zucker, 1986),
with no resulting negative effect on trusting beliefs. High faith in humanity provides another

<-----Page 13----->1998

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

reason to ignore or discount such behavior, because it assumes that most people are basically
good. Having high faith in humanity will facilitate quick forgiveness of trust violations.
Good (1988) has suggested that another reason for this "cognitive inertia" is the "set effect,"
which refers to the continued use of mentally
stored procedures to handle a situation, even
when the situation changes. That is, once people have developed a situational strategy, they
tend to continue to use it, even when it does not
work. Applied to trust, this means that an individual will continue to trust another, even when
the latter breaches the former's trust-at least
for a while. Good (1988) uses the set effect to
reinterpret some of the results of experimentalists who studied trust with such procedures as
the Trucking Game. Note the interactive effect of
this cognitive tendency with the model's contrust and high
structs: high institution-based
disposition to trust jointly encourage a person to
believe such a course of action is not very risky.
Luhmann (1979) offers a related reason for why
trust may be resilient, stating that people build
up mechanisms to handle refutations of their
trust de' -ions. This is especially true when the
felt security associated with trusting intention is
not strong:
Insecure expectations, however paradoxical it
may at first appear, are psychologically more
stable [than secure ones].... [They are] normalized, stereotyped and thus in various ways immunized against the refutation. Explanations of disappointment are built into [them] in such a way
that a particular case of disappointment presents
no problem but rather confirms the structure of
the expectation as a whole" (Luhmann, 1979:79).
Hence, it appears that people develop mechanisms enabling them to absorb disappointments as part of their expectation of the other
person, thus reducing the effect of the disappointment on trusting intention. We speculate
that individuals with high levels of disposition
to trust will absorb disappointments better than
those with low levels.
Proposition 11: In the initial relationship, high trusting intention is likely
to be robust when (1) a combination of
several of its antecedents encourages
the trustor to ignore, rationalize, or absorb the negative actions of the other
and (2) continued success or low perceived risk of failure consequences

485

cause little critical attention to be
paid to the other's behavior. Subjects
with high disposition to trust or institution-based trust levels are likely to
pay even less critical attention.
Social mechanisms. Good (1988) notes that being around another person generally will increase an individual's favorable beliefs about
that person. This occurs because the interpersonal cues from the other person generally are
harder to misconstrue face to face and because
the pair can more easily go beyond surface information to more substantive levels of mutual
understanding. Hence, high levels of trusting
intention likely will be sustained as people interact in cooperative ways. If the individuals
hold positive beliefs about each other, they are
not likely to decrease interaction (Darley &
Fazio, 1980). Therefore, the trusting cycle becomes self-sustaining.
Social interaction also will tend to uphold
early trusting intention, because people in social situations tend to confirm their beliefs
about themselves (Swann, 1983) and about each
other. For example, one who trusts another will
tend to express that trust in actions toward the
other. Because initially extended trust is usually
reciprocated (e.g., Burt & Knez, 1996), the other
party will also express trust. This confirms the
first party's trusting beliefs, as Dasgupta (1988)
notes, which, in turn, supports continued high
levels of trusting intention.
Social interaction also upholds early trusting
intention because of reputation effects. A person's reputation spreads gradually (Dasgupta,
1988), through social interaction (Burt & Knez,
1996). One party remembers the other party's
previous encounters. This interactional history
cumulates, along with information about the
person's background (Dasgupta, 1988), and is
transmitted to others. When many people perceive that an individual has a good reputation,
it is harder for a negative event to significantly
reduce a high level of trusting beliefs in that
individual.
We believe that social interaction also sustains trusting intention through institutionbased trust. When parties interact in a cordial
way, they establish a feeling and appearance
that everything is normal or in proper order
(Lewis & Weigert, 1985a). Hence, social interacnormality belief.
situational
tion sustains

<-----Page 14----->Academy of Management

486

Through situational normality belief, the parties' interaction strengthens trusting intention. If
one has high levels of situational normality belief, one is also likely to believe that structural
assurances will operate properly in the situation. Structural assurance will, in turn, positively influence trusting beliefs and trusting intention, as discussed above.
Proposition 12: In the initial relationship, high trusting intention is likely
to be robust when (1) the parties interact face to face, frequently in positive
ways, or (2) the trusted party has built
a widely known good reputation. Social interaction affects trusting intention by its positive effects on trusting
beliefs and institution-based trust.

AND CONCLUSION
RESEARCHIMPLICATIONS
Future Research Implications
The interplay between trusting intention and
its antecedents helps explain the paradox of
high trust in new relationships and situations
(e.g., Kramer, 1994), but our model also can help
explain "disturbing" results in game theory research (Baxter, 1972: 100)-a well-spring for trust
theory historically. In Baxter's review of the twoperson game theory research, he indicates that
researchers had found no solid link between
trusting personality and trusting behavior in the
Prisoner's Dilemma game. Because our model
ties dispositional variables to beliefs and intentions, it suggests that personality variables may
be too distal from behaviors to be predictive.
Our model's time boundary suggests that disposition-related trust will only be salient when the
parties first meet in an ambiguous situation.
trust constructs
Further, the institution-based
help explain why no solid link was found by
game theorists.
Whereas game theorists assume that the
game context effectively restricts the effects of
situational variables (Baxter, 1972), our model's
use of institution-based trust suggests that what
a subject believes about the situation is an empirical question that should be measured as a
potential confound (e.g., Erez, 1992), rather than
being assumed away. Over 25 years ago, Kee
and Knox recommended
that Prisoner's Dilemma research should include "continuous"
measures of subjects' cognitions in addition to

their behavioral choices (1970: 365). Very little
trust research has been done in this manner.
Our model's constructs provide a reasoned theoretical basis for doing so. We suggest that researchers replicate early behavioral experiments while measuring our constructs. This will
enable researchers to reinterpret historical results.
Significant empirical work is needed in order
to obtain evidence regarding the propositions
we make in this article. First, researchers should
develop reliable and valid instruments reflecting the constructs in this article, and they should
then use them to test various subsets of the
model through questionnaire studies. For example, Propositions 1 and 2 and 4 through 7 could
be tested in one study by measuring trusting
intention, faith in humanity, trusting stance,
structural assurance belief, and benevolence
belief.
Second, researchers should test our categorization and illusion propositions in laboratory
settings, incorporating disposition to trust and
trust constructs as control
institution-based
variables.
Third, researchers should test the model's interactive effects. For example, scholars should
test whether disposition to trust constructs moderate the effects of categorization on trusting
beliefs. Based on Proposition 1, one could test
whether or not structural assurance belief moderates the link between faith in humanity and
trusting beliefs. Trusting stance and institutionbased trust may also have an interactive effect
on trusting intention. The combination of a high
situational normality belief and a high structural assurance belief would probably produce
higher trusting beliefs than either would alone.
Finally, the fragility/robustness of initial trust
should be tested, based on our propositions, in
which we argued that initial trust may be either
fragile or robust under certain conditions. For
example, one could test, through longitudinal
laboratory experiments, the extent to which social interaction increases the robustness of
trusting intention when (1) the relationship is
or (2) risk is high or low.
successful/unsuccessful
Many more conditions could be posited.
Our distinction between trust levels and trust
fragility/robustness raises important issues that
merit further conceptual and empirical work. For
example, a high initial level of trusting intention
may be quite fragile (subject to change),

<-----Page 15----->1998

487

McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany

whereas a low initial level of trusting intention
may not be very fragile. Thus, an interesting
research question is under what conditions are
low initial levels of trusting intention less fragile than high initial levels of trusting intention?
Conclusion
Our primary contribution in this article is explaining the high initial trust paradox by synthesizing a model of constructs and processes
from diverse trust research streams. Because
initial trusting intention is not always high, our
model resolves the paradox by pointing out why
it could be high initially but may not be high
because of the situation or the persons involved.
Thus, the model is predictive based upon specified conditions related to the antecedents of
trusting intention.
This model, along with our discussion of the
conditions producing fragile versus robust initial trust, should generate significant amounts
of research. The delineation of two specific
types of institution-based trust and disposition
to trust constructs provides researchers construct definitions that lend themselves to consisBy using both
tent empirical measurement.
higher-level constructs (e.g., trusting beliefs)
and lower-level constructs (e.g., honesty belief),
we have helped organize the "confusing potpourri" (Shapiro, 1987a: 625) of trust construct
definitions researchers must grapple with.
Our model integrates different aspects of trust
that have not been linked previously, and it does
so within a specific time parameter. Some have
called for more integrative models that simultaneously address dispositional and situational
constructs (Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989; Sitkin &
Pablo, 1992). We have answered this call, creating a model that brings together dispositional,
situational, and interpersonal constructs from
four divergent research streams.
Poole & Van de Ven (1989) remark that by adding the temporal dimension, one can improve
theories. In this article we explain that the processes by which trust forms initially are not the
same as those by which it forms later. In particular, a model of continuing trust will emphasize
experiential knowledge while de-emphasizing
assumptions and dispositions. In this way, the
model's temporal lens highlights the unique aspects of how trust forms at the earliest stage of
an organizational relationship.
