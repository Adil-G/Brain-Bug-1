Product innovation is increasingly valued as a key component of the
sustainable success of a business's operations. As a result, there has
been a noticeable increase in the number of studies directed at explicating the drivers of new product success. To help managers and
researchers synthesize this growing body of evidence, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the new product performance literature. Of the 24
predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage,
market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task proficiencies, and dedicated resources, on average, have the most significant
impact on new product performance. The authors also find that the predictor-performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g.,
the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures of performance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed
since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus
goods, Asian versus North American markets, competition in high-technology versus low-technology markets). They discuss the implications of
these findings and offer directions for further research.

Academic researchers have responded to the growing
managerialemphasis on product innovation with increased
studies that document the antecedents to new productsuccess. Whereas Montoya-Weiss and Calantone (1994) found
18 causal studies (i.e., using correlational,regression,path,
or structuralequation analyses) on new product performance when conducting their review, a review of the current
literaturereveals at least 60 empirical studies thatdocument
the statistical relationship between new product performance and its proposedantecedents.This increasedamountof
researchin turnhas providedthe need and means for a metaanalysis of currentempirical findings. The need for a metaanalysis is also heightened by the great differences in the
direction, statistical significance, and magnitudeof the new
productperformanceeffects for the same predictorvariable

across the reportedmodels (see Montoya-Weissand Calantone 1994). More important,these disparatefindings complicate managers' and academic researchers' efforts to
develop a clear and comprehensive understandingof why
some new productssucceed and others fail.
The purpose of this study is to conduct and present
insights from a meta-analysisof the evidence on the determinants of new product performance.The insights that are
generatedthroughthis quantitativesynthesis of the literature
are likely to be valued by managers and academics whose
job responsibilities and researchinterestsfocus on the marketplace performanceof new productinitiatives.We present
this meta-analysisof the new productperformanceliterature
with these objectives in mind.
DATABASEDEVELOPMENT
When we developed the database for the meta-analysis,
our efforts focused on identifying the populationof studies
on new product performance.To identify these studies, we
conducted keyword searches of electronic databases
(ABI/Inform, UMI ProQuest, Ovid, and WILS) using such
words as "productinnovation,""new products,""pioneering
products,"and so forth.We also searchedthe citations found
in identified studies and performedmanualsearches of leading marketingand managementjournalsin which articles on
product innovation and new product performanceare most
likely published(Academyof ManagementJournal, Journal

Journal of MarketingResearch, Journal of ProductInnovation Management,ManagementScience, and MarketingScience). In addition, we wrote to more than 200 authors of
conceptual and empirical studies on productinnovationasking them for working papers and forthcoming articles on
new product performance.We posted a similar request on
the electronic list server for marketingacademics (ELMAR,
n = 2530 subscribers).

In total, 60 studies that reportedone or more antecedents
to new productsuccess were identified throughthese procedures when the search process was concluded in January
1999. It also became clear that the correlationwas the most
common metric reportedin these studies, or it represented
the metric to which many of the noncorrelationscould be
converted (see Glass, McGaw, and Smith 1981). As a final
step in the process, we wrote to the authorsof studies that
did not reportcorrelationsor relateddataand asked them for
their respective correlationmatrix.Throughthese collective
procedures,we ultimatelyobtainedcorrelationsfor 41 of the
60 studies on productinnovation(35 publishedand 6 unpublished studies).1The 41 studies yielded 798 correlationsthat
we coded into our database.
The emphasis in the coding of the data and analysis of the
correlations is on the model-level correlations(an eventual
averaging of reportedcorrelationsacross all models and all
studies to arriveat an estimate of the centraltendencyof the
predictor-criterionrelationship,such that n is the numberof
correlations)ratherthan the study-level correlations(an initial averagingof the correlationsreportedwithin a study followed by a furtheraveragingof the respective mean correlations across studies; n equals the number of studies). A
model-level analysis is consistent with the approachadvocated by Glass, McGaw, and Smith (1981) and the approach
used in previously published meta-analyses (e.g., Assmus,
Farley, and Lehmann 1984; Churchill et al. 1985; Sultan,
Farley,and Lehmann 1990; Tellis 1988).
A focus on the individualcorrelationsreportedacross all
models is also groundedin several methodologicalconsiderations. For example, the proposedmoderatorsin this analysis
are categorical and often vary across the estimated models
within the same study. As such, a model-level analysis is
more appropriatefor ensuring that all the potential factors
that could be accounting for the differences in the estimated
relationshipsare coded and capturedin the database(Matt
and Cook 1994). Furthermore,we find thatthe samplingerror
variancesand mean correlationsare comparableat the model
and study level, which implies that statementsof generalizability are appropriateat either level of analysis (Hunterand
Schmidt 1990). Finally, the Q test for homogeneity in correlational values is rejected in 85% (57 of 67) of the cases in
which multiplecorrelations(n > 3) arereportedwithina study
for the same antecedent to performance(see Hedges and
Olkin 1985). This evidence furtherimplies thatcapturingand

'A bibliographyof the studies included in the meta-analysisis available
from the authors. Including 68% of all empirical studies in this review is
consistent with the inclusion rates reportedin other meta-analysesin marketing by Brown and Peterson (1993; 66%); Brown and Stayman (1992;
72%); Szymanski, Bharadwaj,and Varadarajan(1993; 63%); and Szymanski, Troy, and Bharadwaj(1995; 70%).

analyzingthe dataat the model level are moreappropriatefor
this meta-analysisbecause of excessive heterogeneityin the
values of the individualcorrelations.
When coding the correlations,we also took care to refer
to the scales reportedin the original studies. We undertook
this additional step in the coding process so that dissimilar
elements would not be combined inappropriatelyand conceptually similar variables would not be coded separately,
as when different authors use slightly different labels to
refer to similar constructs. We also coded other measurement and contextual factors that could distinguish the
respective predictorand criterionfactors and analyzed these
elements for their moderatinginfluences later in the metaanalysis.2Coding errors were mitigated by having an independent, professional auditor and one of the authors independently code all the studies. Coding conformity was
achieved in 98.2% of the cases. We rectified the few inconsistencies that occurred through discussions and reference
to the coding scheme.
ANTECEDENTSOF NEWPRODUCTPERFORMANCE
A review of the predictorvariables coded into the database reveals that 24 antecedents have been reported frequently enough (n > 10 correlations)as affecting new product performance to permit a meaningful investigation of
their effects in a meta-analysis.3To organize these variables
further, a taxonomy was developed. The taxonomy was
grounded in existing frameworks found in the literature
(e.g., Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1987; Montoya-Weissand

2Differencesin how the respective predictorand outcome variablesare
specified in the survey instrumentwere examined as possible explanations
for the variancein effect sizes. The mean correlationsdo not differ (p > .05)
as a function of whether performanceis specified as returnon investment
(.27), sales (.36), share (.38), or profit(.29). Analysis also shows that morenarrowdefinitions of the respectivepredictorvariableshave little effect on
the magnitudeof the correlations.Many of the variablesare specified and
coded consistently across studies (e.g., marketingtask proficiency,technological proficiency, launch proficiency). When semantic differences
seemed possible and enough data points were available,the mean correlations were comparedby subcategoryof the respective predictor.This was
the case for productinnovativeness(radicalnessversus original, novel versus newness to customer), likelihood of competitive response (previous
competitive response indicative of futureresponse versus intensityof competitive actions), and structuredapproach(structuredapproachto the new
product initiative versus well-specified project roles and schedules). The
difference in mean correlationswas not significant for productinnovativeness (p = .45) or competitive response (p = .18). Althoughthe difference in
means for structuredapproachwas significant at a bivariatelevel (p = .03),
it was not significant at a multivariatelevel (p = .79 when we included the
element in our ANOVA in Equation2). Finally, an analysis of year of publication indicatedthat it too was not a significant moderatorof the reported
effect sizes. Year of publication was not significantly correlatedwith the
size of the reportednew product performancecorrelations(r = -.01, p >
.05).
3Restrictingthe investigationto predictorsthat had ten or more observations resulted in 666 correlationsbeing retainedfor analysis in the study.
These correlations capture the 24 consensual variables that have been
examined as predictors of new product performancefrom among the 58
variablesthat have ever been specified as affecting new productperformance in the studies we reviewed. A complete listing of coded factors that
had fewer than ten observations is available from the authors.Because of
the care taken to ensure that variables were assigned to their propercategories, this list of variablescontains elements for which insufficient informationwas available from the studies to combine the elements confidently
into anotherpredictorcategory.

Calantone 1994).4Three productinnovationresearchersalso
reviewed the final taxonomy for completeness and appropriateness of classification. They agreed on the four categories-product, strategy,process, and marketplacecharacteristics-and the placement of specific predictors within
each category as being appropriatefor classifying the many
predictorsof new productperformancethat are examined in
our meta-analysis.
Product characteristics encompass both products and
services, and the term is used generically to refer to both
40ur objective was to develop a logical and user-friendlytypology for
the predictorsincluded in our investigationratherthan develop a definitive
typology. We recognize thatalternativetypologies are possible and do exist.
Because more predictor variablesnow characterizethe productinnovation
literatureand because our investigationis restrictedto the more consensual
ones, our taxonomy necessarily resembles ratherthan perfectly mirrorsthe
previous typologies reportedin the literature.For example, Cooper (1979)
uses nature of the marketplace,resource bases of the firm, nature of the
project, proficiency of process activities, commercial entity, and information acquired. Montoya-Weissand Calantone(1994) use the following categories: strategicfactors, developmentprocess factors, marketenvironment
factors, and organizationalfactors. Our frameworkmore closely resembles
Montoya-Weissand Calantone's more recenttypology, except that we separate out the many product-relatedfactors that now describe the investigations into new product performance.We also coded organizationalfactors
at a more micro level by placing them into the appropriatestrategy or
process categories.

resentativeof the data reportedin Table 2. The information
in Table 1 thereforeprovides a referencefor interpretingthe
labels of the individual predictorvariablesused throughout
the study. The informationin Table 2 provides a reference
for interpretingthe direction for the effects that emerge, on
average. The data in Table 2 furthermotivate an investigation of the potential sources for the reporteddifferences in
effect sizes.
DIFFERENCESRELATEDTO MEASUREMENT
METHODSAND RESEARCHCONTEXT
One observation from a review of Table 2 is the wide
range in the values of certain correlationsthat is evidenced
in the literature. This naturally raises the question, What
accounts for these differences in effect sizes? Previous
researchin meta-analysissuggests thatfour broadcategories
of characteristics often account for systematic differences
across correlations (Assmus, Farley, and Lehmann 1984;
Sultan, Farley, and Lehmann 1990). They are measurement
method, research context, estimation procedure,and model
specification. Because our analysis is restrictedto bivariate
correlations(i.e., the model's estimationprocedureis invariant) that are unaffected by model specification (i.e., omitted
variable bias is not an issue), subsequent attention focuses
on possible measurementmethod and researchcontext variables as explanations for the differences in the sizes of the

retainedin the analysis because it is

correlations.The specific measurementand context factors
examined not only are factors that can be coded from the
extant studies but also representelements that have theoretical justification as potential moderatingfactors (see Table
3). They are elements for which adequate variance exists
within a predictor-performancecorrelate pair (e.g., adequate numberof productversus service observations)to permit a meaningful comparison of the correlations by the
respective difference factor. The logic in meta-analysis is
one of pooling the estimates of association and analyzing
the differences in relationshipstrengthaccordingto the elements that can distinguish these effects (Tellis 1988).
In regard to the new product performanceliterature,the
potential distinguishing elements include the following
measurementfactors: multi-item versus single-item performance measure,subjective versus objective performance
measure, senior manager versus project managerresponse
data, and short-term versus long-term performance data.
They also include the following contextualfactors: services
versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, and
high-technology versus low-technology markets. These
potential moderators of the respective predictor-performance relationships,as well as the degree to which the effects
of the respective predictors generalize across models, are
documented through the application of the analyses and
their correspondingoutcomes, which are discussed next.

OVERVIEW

Research Context

Multi-ItemVersusSingle-ItemPerformanceMeasure
Multi-item scales (e.g., composite of returnon investment, share, and
sales) can enhance the ability to assess reliability,ensure a common reference for decision making, and be effective for capturingthe broader
domain of new productperformance(Churchill 1979; Griffin and Page
1996). Using multi-itemscales thereforecould lead to estimates of association strength that differ from those grounded in data gathered from
single-item scales.

Services VersusGoods
Services are presentedas more intangible,less consistent, less separable
in productionand consumption, and more perishable than goods (Zeithaml, Parasuraman,and Berry 1985). Service evaluations are also presented as being based on differentexpectationsthanevaluationsof goods
and are groundedin processes and outcomes (Gronroos 1982; Zeithaml,
Berry,and Parasuraman1993). These differences could be evidenced in
the correlationsfor new productperformancebeing differentfor services
versus goods.

Subjective VersusObjectivePerformanceData
New product performancehas been operationalized through objective
data from company records(returnon investment,share, sales, or profit)
and subjective data from managers(assessments of success versus failure). Whereas objective data derived from standardaccounting procedures generally would be considered accurateand bias free, subjective
assessments are likely to reflect the biases and imperfectinformationthat
characterize human decision making. As a consequence, subjective
assessments may overstate or understatethe true level of new product
performance (Ford, Smith, and Swasy 1990; Nelson 1974), leading to
correlationsthat differ from those groundedin objective data.
Senior Manager VersusProject Manager Data
Whetherthe data are gatheredfrom projectmanagersor senior managers
could make a difference. Projectmanagersoften are more familiar with
relevant details, monitor the situation more closely, and provide more
accurate assessments of product performance.In contrast, senior managers are portrayedas more distant and less involved in the day-to-day
activities of new products(Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1995; Griffin and
Page 1996; Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994). As a result, survey
responses and the correlations based on those responses could vary
depending on whethersenior managersor projectmanagersprovidedthe
data.
Short-TermVersusLong-TermPerformanceData
The correlationscould varydependingon whetherperformancewas capturedcloser to when the productwas introduced(less than 36 months)or
after more time has elapsed since product introduction(more than 36
months).aProductdiffusion is groundedin the principlethat the first purchases of a new productby a populationoccur over time (Sultan, Farley,
and Lehmann 1990). This implies that the full effects of product, firm
strategy,firm process, or marketplaceelements on new productperformance are likely to be evidenced only after considerabletime has elapsed
since productintroduction.Therefore,the elapsed time since the product
was first introducedonto the marketcould affect estimates of relationship strength.

Asia VersusNorthAmerica
Evidence suggests that the magnitudeand statisticalsignificance of certain effects on new product performancecan be region specific (Parry
and Song 1994; Souder and Song 1997) because of differences in cultural values (e.g., individualismversus collectivism; Hofstede 1980) or
differences in new product development processes. Nonaka (1990), for
example, describes the Japanese new product development process as
highly fluid and iterative, raising the possibility that North American
processes may not be similarly fluid or iterative. More important,the
possibility of such differences imply thatgeographiclocation-Asia versus NorthAmerica-could moderateestimates of relationshipstrengthin
the context of new productperformance.
High-TechnologyVersusLow-TechnologyMarkets
High-technology markets have been characterized as more complex,
informationintensive,turbulent,and uncertainbecause of rapidlychanging and heterogeneous technologies, competitive, and differentially
responsive to structuralarrangementsthat can affect the informationprocessing patterns of buyers (e.g., Capon and Glazer 1987; Glazer
1991; Heide and Weiss 1995). They are also characterizedby offerings
that are based on significant amounts of scientific and technical knowhow (John,Weiss, and Dutta 1999), such as marketsserved by competitors in the electronics industry(e.g., Maidique and Ziger 1984). These
characteristicsthat define high-technology marketscould moderatethe
effects of a structuredapproach (greater structurein high-technology
markets accompanied by diminished performance),market orientation
(gatheringand reacting to informationbeing more critical in high-technology marketswhere more informationis available and productcycle
time can be shorter),and perhapsotherclassical predictorsof the success
of new productofferings.

aThirty-sixmonths is a point of demarcationoften presentedin the productinnovation literature(e.g., Cooper 1984; de Brentani 1989; Souder and Song
1997). This dichotomous patternof reportingby authorspoints to a categorical ratherthan a continuousspecification for time since introductionwithin the
meta-analysis.

FINDINGS FROMTHEMETA-ANALYSIS
Bivariate Tendenciesof the New ProductPerformanceEffects
The analysis of the correlationsbetween new productsuccess and its proposed predictorsbegins with the estimation
of the central tendencies of the correctedcorrelations-that
is, the correlationscorrectedfor samplingerror(sample size
differences) and measurementerror(scale reliability differences)-using the classical approachoutlinedby Hunterand
Schmidt (1990).5 Central tendency and variance statistics
5The sample size-corrected mean (the mean correctedfor unsystematic
variance due to differences in sample sizes) is estimated and furthercorrected for differences in scale reliability (the sample size-weighted mean
furthercorrected for systematic variancedue to the variabilityin the reliability of the measures). The reliability-correctedmean is then the focus in
the study because, ceteris paribus,a correlationbased on largersamples and
estimated from more reliable data is likely to be closer to the population

for the individualpredictorsof new productperformanceare
summarizedin Table 4. The subsequentdiscussion of these
data emphasizes not only the statistically significant effects
but also the relative magnitudes of the effects. Relative
effects are emphasized because the firms whose data are
capturedin the original studies likely representthe efficient
frontierof firms (i.e., existing firms that by definition have
marketed new products successfully at some time). This
implies that firms that have never successfully marketeda

mean. However,reliabilitiesare not always reportedby authors,and therefore the reliability-adjustedmean cannot always be estimated. In such
cases, the next best estimate of the population mean, the sample
size-weighted mean, is emphasized.

attention.

A review of the data in Table 4 reveals that the effects of
several classical elements on new product performancedo
not generalize across models. It furtherreveals that only a
subset of the statistically significant predictorscan be considered dominantdriversof new productperformance.This
subset of driversnonetheless spans the full spectrumof predictor categories. Finally, modeling efforts often overemphasize the relatively less dominantdriversof new product
performance.Each of these findings is discussed in more
detail next.
Significantand nonsignificantdrivers. Table4 shows that
the corrected mean correlationsfor product innovativeness
(r = .24), technological synergy (r = .31), marketorientation
(r = .43), customer input (r = .43), cross-functionalintegration (r = .23), cross-functionalcommunication(r = .09), and
competitive response intensity (r = -.08) are not statistically
significant at conventional probability levels (p > .05).
Therefore, the cumulative evidence indicates that their
effects on performance do not generalize across research
models, despite theory and growing research interest that
touts the performancemerits of emphasizing such factors in
the new product performance equation (e.g., Geroski,
Machin, and Van Reenen 1993).
The cumulativeevidence shows, however,that the effects
of marketpotential, productadvantage,marketingtask proficiency, and several other classical drivers of new product
performancegeneralize across studies and their models (see
Table 4). The corrected mean correlations for 17 of the
antecedents are significant above conventional levels of
chance (p < .05), and they beara directionalsign thatis consistent with classical perspectives (see Table 2). The high
numbersfor availabilitybias reportedin Table2 (i.e., 130 to
7196 additionalestimates of zero correlationneed to exist in
the file drawersof researchersfor the mean correlationsto
be nonsignificant)also indicate that these elements are significant above chance levels.
Dominant drivers of performance.A review of the statistically significant predictors of new product performance
reveals that ten of the antecedents can be considered relatively dominant drivers of new product success (mean r >
.40). They are marketpotential (r = .54), dedicated human
resources (r = .52), marketing task proficiency (r = .50),
productmeeting customerneeds (r = .50), productadvantage
(r = .48), predevelopmenttask proficiency (r = .46), dedicated researchand development(R&D) resources (r = .45),
technological proficiency (r = .43), launch proficiency (r =
.43), orderof entry (r = .41), and the technological sophistication of the product(r = .41). These data imply that only a
few of the many factors that have been examined repeatedly
by researchers thus far demonstrate sufficient ability, on
average, to affect performancelevels meaningfully.
Breadth of performancedrivers. An additionalreview of
these ten predictor variables reveals that they nonetheless
represent all four broad-basedcategories of antecedents to
new product success. Three of the predictors are product
characteristics (products meeting customer needs, product
advantage, and product technological sophistication), two
are strategy characteristics (R&D and human resources),
four are process characteristics(marketing,predevelopment,
technological, and launch proficiencies), and one is a marketplace characteristic (market potential). These findings
attest to the intricatenatureof the new productperformance

phenomenon.Although successful performancemay depend
greatly on relatively few elements, performanceis multifaceted, depending on selected elements from each majorfacet
of the new productdevelopmentand introductioninitiative.
Prior emphasis in performancemodeling. When only the
statistically significant means in Table 4 are considered
(e.g., the absolute value of the mean correlationfor product
advantage with performance),marketplace(r = .46), strategy (r = .43), and productcharacteristics(r = .43) display
greater average effects on new product performance than
process characteristics(r = .37). These findings imply that,
ceteris paribus, placing more emphasis on marketplace,
strategy,and productcharacteristicsthan on process characteristics would, on average, be more appropriatefor augmentingsuccess levels. These broadcategories of predictors
also offer greaterexplanatoryand predictivevalue for modeling the antecedents to new product success. These findings, in turn, raise the question, Which factors have been
emphasized the most in previous modeling efforts?
The data reveal that the greatest attention has been
directedat capturingprocess characteristics-that is, the set
of elements that the cumulativedata indicate have the least
impact on new product performancelevels (Table 2). Perhaps because process is the primarycontrol that management wields, two to six times as many models have incorporatedprocess characteristicsin their equations (n = 370)
than strategy (n = 145), product (n = 97), or marketplace
characteristics(n = 54). A similarpatternis found when only
the predictorsdisplaying statistically significant mean correlations are considered (i.e., the ns are totaled across only
the categories of individualpredictorsthat have statistically
significant overall means). Process characteristicsare captured in 195 models, whereas strategy characteristicsare
capturedin 120 models, productcharacteristicsin 80 models, and marketplacecharacteristicsin just 35 models.
The tendency to emphasize less critical predictors over
more dominantpredictorsof new productsuccess continues
when attention shifts to the individual predictor variables.
The most frequently modeled predictors (n > 40 modeled
effects) are marketingsynergy (n = 61), marketorientation
(n = 60), cross-functionalcommunication (n = 58), structured approach(n = 53), product advantage (n = 44), and
marketingtask proficiency(n = 40). However,the mean correlations for market orientation and cross-functional communication are not statistically significant, and the mean
correlationsfor marketingsynergy (mean r = .34) and structuredapproach(mean r = .25) are more modest in size. Just
two of the dominant drivers of new product success have
been modeled relatively frequently:productadvantageand
marketing task proficiency. Assuming that the respective
mean correlationsare centered similarly over their population means and the measuresof the respective relationships
are sufficient,the findings draw attentionto a disproportionate modeling emphasis directed at capturingthe relatively
less importantantecedents to new product success. These
findings also accent the need to ensure that the more dominant driversare specified in future performancemodels.

analysis of the correlations,a multivariateanalysis can reaf-

<-----Page 8----->369

Why Some New Products Are More Successful Than Others
firm the bivariatefindings and add to understandingby documenting the unique contributionof each of the predictors
of new productsuccess. A multivariateregressionmodel of
new productperformanceis thereforeestimated.To this end,
a matrix of corrected correlations is constructed from the
availabledata and used as input for estimatingthe following
regression model:
(1)

NPP = aoiX1 + o2X2 + ... + ajXj + ?,

where NPP is new productperformance,Xi are performance
predictors,and aCare the parameterestimates. Because few
studies examine or reportcorrelationaldata on the interrelationshipsamong the antecedentsto new productsuccess, the
correlationmatrixcontains data for only a subset of the predictors (see Table 5, Panel A): product advantage,product
innovativeness, marketing synergy, technological synergy,
structured approach, market orientation, cross-functional
integration,and competitive response intensity.The findings
from the estimation of Equation I are presentedin Table 5,
Panel B.
Table 5 shows that even the relatively parsimonious
model of new productsuccess accounts for a majorityof the
variance in new product performance,specifically, 59% of
the variance (see Equation 1). We also find that product
advantage(P = .44, p < .05) and technological synergies (P =
.42, p < .05) have the largestrelativeeffects on new product
success rates. This relative order of magnitudeand amount
of variancecapturedby the model even hold when the two
statistically nonsignificant predictors from the first model
are removed and the model is reestimated. Collectively,

these data suggest that a reducedmodel can still account for
much of the variancein new productperformance.
A furtherreview of the multivariatefindings in reference
to the previouslyreportedbivariatecorrelationsin which the
findings are based (see Table4) naturallyreveals many similarities in the patternof results across both types of analysis. The mean bivariate correlations for cross-functional
integration(r = .23, p < .05) and structuredapproach (r =
.25, p < .05), for example, are relativelysmall in magnitude,
and these factorsare not significant in the regressionmodel.
Second, the mean correlations for product innovativeness
(r = .23, p < .05), marketorientation(r = .43, p > .05), and
marketingsynergy (r = .34, p < .05) are relatively modest in
size or nonsignificant,and theirrespectiveregressioncoefficients are also relatively modest in size (3 < .30). Third,
product advantage is identified as a dominant predictorof
performancein the bivariateanalysis (r = .48, p < .05) and
emerges as a dominantdriverof new productperformancein
the multivariateanalysis (P = .44, p < .05) as well. Finally,
although the mean correlationfor technological synergy is
not statistically significant (r = .31, p > .05), technological
synergy is shown to play a practicallyand statistically significant role in new productsuccess (P = .42, p < .05) when
the roles of the otherelements in the model are factoredout.
Therefore,when the unique effects of the various driversof
new product performanceare investigated, capitalizing on
related technologies emerges as a prominentantecedent to
new productperformance,and offering productsthatdisplay
distinct advantagesretains its status as a dominantdriverof
new productsuccess.

Measurementand ContextEffects as Explanationsof the
Differences in Effect Sizes
Preliminaryanalysis. In addition to identifying the relative effects of each predictoron new productperformance,
the meta-analysispursuesexplanationsfor why the strength
of the respectiverelationshipsdiffers across models. We first
highlight a partitioningof total varianceinto varianceattributable to sampling errorand to differences in scale reliabilities (see Table 4). This partitioning provides a necessary
methodological foundation for pursuing the measurement
and contextual factors outlined in Table 3 as sources for the
differences in the correlationalvalues. In this regard,if more
than25% of the variancein the correlationsremainsafterthe
partitioningof variance,a search for other moderatingvariables is deemed appropriatefrom the standpointthatany statistically significant moderatorsthat are found are unlikely
to be significant because of chance (Hunter and Schmidt
1990). What we find is that 38%-98% of the variancein the
new product performancecorrelations remains after sampling and reliability differences are accounted for (see
"RemainingVariance"column in Table4). These data imply
that a furthersearch for explanatoryvariablesis called for.
We executed the search for explanatory variables using
dummy-variable regression (or analysis of variance
[ANOVA]). A separate ANOVA model was estimated for
each of the 24 predictor-performancepairs (Hedges and
Olkin 1985; Sultan, Farley,and Lehmann 1990). The objective in estimating these models is one of documenting the
effects of the various measurement method and research
context variables on resulting estimates of relationship
strength.Each estimated model has the following form:
(2)

rNpp,d=

+ (pIYl + q(2Y2 + (3Y3 + (P4Y4+ (5Y5
+ (p6Y6 + (p7Y7 + ?,

where rNPPd is the z transformedvalue of the correctedcorrelation between new productperformanceand the respective driverd, (pare parameterestimates, andYi are categorical variables specified at two levels. Y1 is a multi-item
versus single-item performancemeasure,Y2 is a subjective
versus objective performancemeasure,Y3 is a senior manager versus project managerrespondent,Y4 is a short-term
versus long-term performancemeasure,Y5 is service versus
product context, Y6 is Asian versus North American markets, and Y7 is high-technology versus low-technology markets. The outcomes from this estimation procedureare presented in Table 6.
Measurementeffects. The data in Table 6 reveal that the
measurementand contextual factors outlined in Table 3 can
at times account for a statistically significant portion of the
variance in the new product performance relationships.
Although eight of the models are not statisticallysignificant
and no single factor is statistically significant in more than
five of the models, several noteworthyinsights emerge from
a review of the data. One involves the time frame-whether
innovationeffects are capturedless or more than 36 months
after launch. Generally,the sampling time frame matterslittle in the few cases in which there are enough observations
for it to be modeled. However,it is statisticallysignificant in
the context of order-of-entryeffects (3 = -.43, p < .05).
Order-of-entry effects on new product performance are
weaker, on average, when new product performance is a

short-termmeasure.These findings imply that the effects of
being first to the marketwith a new offering are evidenced
more fully when considerable time has elapsed since product introduction.
Using subjective versus objective performancemeasures
can also make a difference for estimatingperformancerelationships. The correlationsare lower between performance
and both reduced cycle time (3 = -.74, p < .05) and crossfunctional integration(P = -.64, p < .05) when subjective
assessments of performanceare used. In contrast,the relationships are higher, on average, in the case of products
meeting customer needs (P = 1.68, p < .05) and dedicated
humanresources(p = 1.33, p < .05). Although few patterns
are evidenced across these data, one that is suggested is that
objective performancedata yield strongerrelationships,on
average,with selected process characteristics.This outcome
may be capturing the ability to objectively measure cycle
time or cross-functionalintegrationso that the natureof the
predictor and performance measures is similar. Certainly,
more research into this phenomenon is necessary to establish the validity of this or any other explanationput forth in
regard to the objectivity of performancelevels. However,
these findings highlight the need to document the better
measureof performancein futurestudies. How performance
is captured can lead to different estimates of relationship
strength.Differentestimates of relationshipstrength,in turn,
can hold differentimplicationsfor the content and outcomes
of strategicplans.
More researchis also called for in regardto the explanations for the outcomes when multi-item versus single-item
scales are used for capturing performance. We find that
multi-itemversus single-item is a significantexplanationfor
the differences in effect sizes across five predictorvariables:
product advantage(P = -.67, p < .05), product meets customer needs (P = -1.41, p < .05), marketingsynergy (P =
.35, p < .05), senior managementsupport(P = .63, p < .05),
and marketpotential (P = .78, p < .05). These data indicate
that using multiple items to capture success levels often
translates into different measures of association. More
important,these measurementdifferences could lead to different conclusions and different strategies that are manifested in different performanceoutcomes. Such possibilities, combined with the claims that multi-item measures in
general are more reliable and accurate (e.g., Churchill
1979), argue in favor of using multi-item measures of performancewhen testing models of new productsuccess in the
future.

Contextualeffects. In additionto measurementeffects, the
findings in Table 6 indicate that geographic region (Asia
versus North America), type of offering (services versus
goods) and nature of the market (high-technology versus
low-technology markets)can account for some of the variance in the predictor-performancerelationships.The regression findings here point to several cases in which performance correlationsdiffer by geographicregion.The effects on
performanceof technological sophistication (P = .80, p <
.05), marketingsynergies (13= .61, p < .05), marketorientation (P = .61, p < .05), and senior managementsupport(P =
1.32, p < .05) are all greaterin an Asian context, particularly
when the threat of competitive reactions is also low (P =
-.75, p < .05). These findings imply not only that producing
and selling new offerings is not the same across Asia and
North America but also that successful performance in
Asian marketsaccrues to firms that display more marketing
savvy and top managementsupport.Success also accrues to
firms that sell in carefully chosen, high-technology markets
(i.e., markets where the threat of competitive reactions is
minimal).
With regardto the type of offering, services versus goods,
the findings show that the predictor-performancerelationship is stronger in a service context when the predictoris
marketingsynergy (P = .53, p < .05). However,the relationship is weaker when the predictorsare structuredapproach
(P=-.46, p < .05) and cross-functionalcommunication(P =
-.52, p < .05). These findings provide the initial documentation indicatingthat marketingsynergies are more important
in a services ratherthan goods context. These findings may
reflect the greater need to communicatefurtherthe intangibles that characterize services. They may also reflect the
greater need to capitalize on associated knowledge to portray a more complete picture of the service (e.g., capitalizing on brand-namerecognition, other service offerings, or
other derivativesfrom brandequity). The data furtherimply
that less structure(i.e., the absence of a structuredapproach
and the absence of the structural impediments that are
implied in greater cross-functional communication) has a
positive effect on the success levels achieved by new services. This may be because services are more heterogeneous
to begin with (Zeithaml, Parasuraman,and Berry 1985) and
necessitate less structureso thatthe new services can be easily customized to match consumer needs.
Similarly, we find that less structureis important( =
-.44, p < .05) to the success of new productsin marketsthat
are traditionallymore turbulentand more uncertainbecause
of heterogeneous and rapidly changing technologies
(Glazer 1991). Participants'general lack of relevantexperience with new technologies (i.e., a greater probability of
making mistakes) and the rapid pace at which technologies
become obsolete (i.e., the relatively short time between
entry and availability of a superior competitive offering)
may also explain why being first to the market is not necessarily a performanceadvantage for selling new products

in high-technology markets (P = -.40, p < .05). What is
manifestedin superiorperformanceis the dedicationof personnel to the new product initiative (1 = .61, p < .05), the
offering of products consistent with the general nature of
the market(i.e., selling technologically sophisticatedproducts in high-technology markets;P = .72, p < .05), and the
sale of productsthat have a distinct competitive advantage
(1 = .52, p < .05). These and other findings are discussed
next along with study limitations and directions for future
study.
DISCUSSION
The goals of a meta-analysis are to present substantive
informationabout the net effects that characterizea body of
research, provide insights into methodological issues, and
offer suggestions for furtherresearchon the basis of what is
known and what remainsto be learned(Assmus, Farley,and
Lehmann 1984). Thus, a meta-analysisprovides a rigorous
alternative to a casual, narrativediscussion of a rapidly
expandingresearchliterature(Wolf 1986). From our review
of the empirical literature,we offer insights into the variety
of evidence and the multitude of factors that have been
reportedin the quest to identify the key driversof new product success. The empirical evidence supportsconventional
wisdom regardingdirectionalityand statistical significance
for several classical variables. We further document the
magnitudeof the relationshipsthatcan be expected, on average, and the conditions underwhich relatively largerversus
smaller performanceeffects can be expected. The findings
simultaneously cast doubt over the performanceimpact of
certainpredictorsand raise new questions for managersand
researchersto address.Several of these effects have already
been discussed and are not reiteratedhere in favor of a discussion thatfocuses on additionalfindingsand implications;
specifically, the relevance of the findings for functional
diversity in new product development teams, principles of
organizationaland strategicalignment,and managerialperceptions and business performance.Functionaldiversityhas
been an area of directed research attention in the product
innovationliterature(see Table 2) and is one in which further observations and insights can be brought to light
through the meta-analysis. Issues surroundingalignment
and managerialperceptions,in contrast,have not been subjected to much examinationor discussion in the context of
new products,but again, the meta-analysiscan offer several
unique insights of relevance to managerialpracticeand further research.
Functional Diversity
As the use of teams or work groups for the new product
initiatives becomes prevalent, questions surrounding the
composition of teams for maximizing new productsuccess
naturallyarise (see Donellon 1993; Norrgrenand Schaller
1999). It is relevant to ask, Should team members be from
the same functionalspecialty,or should the team have members from different functional backgrounds?In theory, a
greater variety of specialties could bring with it a broader
base of knowledge for both managing the new productinitiative and identifying and generating new product ideas.
Aiken, Bacharach, and French (1980), for example, document a positive relationship between number of occupational specialties and rate of innovation, and King and

<-----Page 12----->Why Some New Products Are More Successful Than Others
Anderson (1990) document a positive relationshipbetween
the diversity of team membersand creativity.
Although greater diversity in functional specialty may
indeed be related to the rate of innovationthat results from
the generation of new product ideas, the cumulative evidence indicates that elements of functionaldiversity are not
directly related to new product performanceper se. In this
regard,we find thatcross-functionalissues and new product
performance are not significantly correlated, on average.
This is true for both cross-functional integration(mean r =
.23, p > .05) and cross-functionalcommunication(mean r =
.09, p > .05). We furtherfind that cross-functionalcommunication effects are moderatedby whetherservices or products are the focus and that cross-functional integration
effects are moderatedby the natureof the performancedata
(subjective versus objective). Together,these findings bring
into question the blanketneed for functionaldiversity in the
context of improving overall new product performance.
Although functional diversity can play a role in the tasks
that lead up to new productperformance(e.g., idea generation) and can be effective for improvingperformancein limited situations, integrationof more functionalareas into the
new product initiative and heightened communication
across these areas may not always representa productive
approach for directly improving the success of new products. Rather,integrationin the selected contexts and under
the selected conditions outlined may be more advisable.
StrategicAlignment
The findings from the meta-analysisalso lend credence to
the notion that strategic fit and product performance are
related. The literature in both strategic management and
organizationaltheory points to the potentialincrease in performance that can occur when businesses align themselves
to their environment (e.g., Bourgeois 1985; Burns and
Stalker 1961). Our analysis of contextualeffects in the context of new product performanceechoes these theoretical
perspectives.We find that a matchingof the product,strategies, and processes to the environmentalcontext (see the
"ContextualFactors"columns in Table 6) can be important
for augmenting new product performance in the sale of
goods and services in high-technology markets.For example, the moderatoranalysis reveals that delaying entry,having less structure,having more personnel, and selling more
sophisticated products that have an advantage over other
offerings are of greater importance to the success of new
products that are targeted to high-technology markets. In
other words, properly aligning these elements to the product-service context as well as the technological level of the
marketplacecan be importantfor ensuringthat new product
performancelevels are optimized.
The data in Table 6 furthersupport the notion of alignment that is embedded in the discussion of adaptingversus
standardizing strategies for serving domestic and foreign
markets (e.g., Leavitt 1983; Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and
Varadarajan1993; Walters 1986). We find that it is not necessarily adaptation that holds the key to successful new
productperformancein foreign markets.Rather,adaptation
along selected productfacets and selected dimensions of the
organizationand its strategiesis what holds the keys to new
productsuccess in an internationalcontext. Specifically, we
find that adaptinginternationalmarketingstrategyalong the

373

following dimensions can be importantto achieving success
in Asian versus North American markets: technological
sophistication of the product, marketingsynergies, market
orientation, and senior-level support (see Table 6). These
data thereforenot only documentthe potentialvalue of product, organizational, and strategic alignment for fostering
strongerpredictor-performancerelationshipsbut also document the specific elements for which fit may be considered
an imperativefor effective new productperformance.
Managers' Perceptions
The meta-analysis also provides initial evidence that
atteststo the role of divergentmanagerialperceptionsin new
productperformance.There is a growing streamof research
in managementthatdocumentsthe correlationbetween poor
firm performance and inaccurate managerial perceptions
(e.g., Starbuckand Mezias 1996; Sutcliffe 1994; Thomas,
Clark, and Giola 1993). Inaccuracy has been defined in
terms of deviation from a comparisonwith a more objective
standard as well as lack of consensus among parties
(Kruglanski 1989). These inaccuraciesare thought to occur
because of managers'selective attention,perceptualscreens,
personal biases, collective blindness, tunnel vision, functional fixedness, strategic myopia, and/or contested belief
structures(Walsh 1988).
In this regard,the findings from the meta-analysis indicate that managementperceptionscan differ from objective
estimates of performance,and these differences can have a
statistically significant effect on the magnitude of the estimated relationships for several predictors of performance
(see "SubjectiveVersusObjectiveCriteria"column in Table
6). These predictors include products meeting customer
needs, dedicated human resources, technological proficiency, reducedcycle time, and cross-functionalintegration.
We furtherfind that a failure to achieve consensus among
senior and productmanagersis manifested in new product
performance levels (see "Senior Versus Project Manager"
column in Table 6); several of the performancecorrelations
differ to a statistically significant degree depending on
whetherthe data is gatheredfrom managersat the senior or
product level. For example, these perceptual disparities
account for differences in the estimated relationships for
performancewith order of entry, structuredapproach,marketing task proficiency, senior management support, and
likelihood of competitive response. Disagreements among
managers can lead not only to dysfunctional conflict
(Tjosvold 1985) but also to inferior new product performance when the strategiesinitiated by one party or the other
are inappropriateor ill-supported.Thus, although the data
reportedhere cannot addressthe direct effects of perceptual
divergenceor disagreementsamong managerson new product performance,the data documentthe contingency effects
of disparateperceptionson the driversof new product performance, thus providing new insight for managers and
researchers.
LIMITATIONS
As is widely recognized and documented in the metaanalysis literature (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Hunter and
Schmidt 1990), any quantitativesynthesis is constrainedby
the natureand scope of the original studies on which it is
based, and these limitationsshould be borne in mind when

<-----Page 13----->374
the findings presentedhere are interpreted.First, not all of
the studies reportedcorrelations,and not all the authorsof
these could provide us with correlationaldata. As a result,
some studies could not be incorporatedinto the meta-analysis. Second, the cross-sectional natureof the original studies
delimits our ability to make confident causal inferences.
Although time-series data would be most desirablefor these
purposes, they are unavailable in the original studies, and
therefore a reliance on cross-sectional data for making
causal inferences naturallyexists in the product innovation
literature.Third, we have previously acknowledgedthat the
relationshipsreportedin the original studies could be positively biased because of oversampling from the efficient
frontier of firms. Firms that fail to innovate successfully
have likely exited the market and are not captured in the
databasesused in productinnovationstudies. Unfortunately,
a meta-analysisis not equippedto identify,estimate, or correct for this artifact in the original studies. Fourth,a metaanalysis is constrained to examining moderatingelements
that can be coded from the extant literature.That the moderatingelements thatcould be coded do not fully accountfor
the variance in the performancecorrelations indicates that
additional measurement factors (e.g., sampling plan: convenience sample versus probability sample; respondent
characteristics: years in the organization, new product
involvement) and/or contextual factors (e.g., company size,
industry, longevity) need to be modeled and reported in
future studies on new productperformance.
DIRECTIONSFOR FURTHERRESEARCH
In addition to overcoming these sampling, modeling, and
information reporting deficiencies, studies should concentrate on modeling elements that have shown initial promise
as antecedentsto new productsuccess. One element is product quality, which has been widely acclaimed in the popular
press as an importantand distinct component (i.e., something other than all nonprice attributes)that affects consumer choice. The few correlations(n = 6) for productquality with new product performance in our database also
document that, on average, productquality has an appreciable effect on how well new productsperform(mean r = .40,
p < .05). Nonetheless, a paucity of research attention has
been directed at specifying productquality separatelyas an
antecedentto new productperformance.
Similarly, few attempts have been made to model how
firms generate ideas for new products and how successful
idea generation and success at each of the other phases of
the new product initiative eventually translate into new
productsuccess. This void in researchattentionpersistseven
though the generation of new productideas is arguablythe
first step in a cumulative new productdevelopmentprocess
(Booz-Allen & Hamilton 1982); predevelopmenttask proficiencies and new productperformanceare, on average,positively correlated(r = .46; see Table 4); and firms that attain
high marks in new product introductions generally are
shown to be more successful at generating and screening
new ideas (e.g., Barczak 1995; Cooper 1984). These deficiencies in the new product performanceliteraturesuggest
that modeling firm proficiencies at each stage of the new
productdevelopment process for their effects on new product performance could provide valuable insights to managers and academic researchers.

JOURNAL OF MARKETINGRESEARCH, AUGUST 2001
This study also highlights a need for researchdirected at
capturingthe interrelationshipsamong the predictorsof new
product performance. As our synthesis of the literature
makes apparent,the overwhelming majority of models of
new product performance are main-effect models (for
exceptions, see Atuahene-Gima 1995; Song, MontoyaWeiss, and Schmidt 1997; Song and Parry 1997; Song,
Souder, and Dyer 1997). This modeling perspectivedominates the empiricallandscapedespite the competing logic to
suggest that selected antecedentsto performancemay play a
more prominentrole under selected conditions (e.g., orderof-entry effects may be augmented in companies that are
more marketoriented). Certainantecedentsto performance
may also indirectly affect performanceby affecting other
drivers of new product success (e.g., greatereconomies of
scope realized from the likely association between greater
cross-functional integration and greater cross-functional
communication).Therefore, the opportunitypresents itself
to advanceunderstandingby formulatingand testing models
that capturethe interrelationshipsamong the predictorvariables. These more sophisticated models represent natural
extensions of currentresearchefforts directedat explicating
the drivers of new product success. More important,these
and other research directions that become apparentas evidence accumulates must be pursuedto formulatea knowledge base that can be used by managers to improve new
productperformanceeffectively.
